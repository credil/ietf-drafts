                      BGP operations and security
                   draft-jdurand-bgp-security-01.txt

Abstract

   BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the protocol used in the internet to
   exchange routing information between network domains.  This protocol
   does not directly include mechanisms that control that routes
   exchanged conform to the various rules defined by the Internet
   community.  This document intends to summarize most common existing
   rules and help network administrators applying simply coherent BGP
   policies.  First it recalls mechanisms that administrators can use to
   protect the BGP sessions, with TTL and MD5.  Then the document
   describes the prefix filters that can be used, how some of them can
   be automated, and where they apply in the BGP network.  Afterwards,
   applicability of other methods including BGP route flap dampening,
   limiting maximum prefixes per peering, AS-path filtering and
   community scrubbing is analyzed.

Internet-Draft                  BGP OPSEC                      June 2012


1.  Introduction

   BGP [6] is the protocol used in the internet to exchange routing
   information between network domains.  This protocol does not directly
   include mechanisms that control that routes exchanged conform to the
   various rules defined by the Internet community.  This document
   intends to summarize most common existing rules and help network
   administrators applying simply coherent BGP policies.


2.  Definitions

   o  BGP peering: any TCP BGP connection on the Internet.


3.  Protection of BGP sessions

3.1.  MD5 passwords on BGP peerings

   BGP sessions can be secured with MD5 passwords [9], to protect
   against attacks that could bring down the session (by sending spoofed
   TCP RST packets) or possibly insert packets into the TCP stream
   (routing attacks).

   The drawback of TCP/MD5 is additional management overhead for
   password maintenance.  MD5 protection is recommended when peerings
   are established over shared networks where spoofing can be done (like
   internet exchanges, IXPs).

   You should block spoofed packets (packets with source IP address
   belonging to your IP address space) at all edges of your network,
   making TCP/MD5 protection of BGP sessions unnecessary on iBGP session
   or EBGP sessions run over point-to-point links.

3.2.  BGP TTL security

   BGP sessions can be made harder to spoof with the TTL security [8].
   Instead of sending TCP packets with TTL value = 1, the routers send
   the TCP packets with TTL value = 255 and the receiver checks that the
   TTL value equals 255.  Since it's impossible to send an IP packet
   with TTL = 255 to a non-directly-connected IP host, BGP TTL security
   effectively prevents all spoofing attacks coming from third parties
   not directly connected to the same subnet as the BGP-speaking
   routers.

   Note: Like MD5 protection, TTL security has to be configured on both
   ends of a BGP session.

4.  Prefix filtering

   The main aspect of securing BGP resides in controlling the prefixes
   that are received/advertised on the BGP peerings.  Prefixes exchanged
   between BGP peers are controlled with inbound and outbound filters
   that can match on IP prefixes (prefix filters, Section 4), AS paths
   (as-path filters, Section 7) or any other attributes of a BGP prefix
   (for example, BGP communities, Section 8).

4.1.  Definition of prefix filters

   This section list the most commonly used prefix filters.  Following
   sections will clarify where these filters should be applied.

4.1.1.  Prefixes that MUST not be routed by definition

4.1.1.1.  IPv4

   RFC5735 [15] clarifies "special" IPv4 prefixes and their status in
   the Internet.  Since publication of the RFC another prefix has been
   added on the list of the special use prefixes.  Following prefixes
   MUST NOT cross network boundaries (ie.  ASN) and therefore MUST be
   filtered:

   o  10.0.0.0/8 and more specific - private use [15]

   o  100.64.0.0/10 and more specific - shared address space [26]

   o  127.0.0.0/8 and more specific - loopbacks [15]

   o  169.254.0.0/16 and more specific - link-local [15]

   o  172.16.0.0/12 and more specific - private use [15]

   o  192.0.2.0/24 and more specific - documentation [15]

   o  192.168.0.0/16 and more specific - private use [15]

   o  224.0.0.0/4 and more specific - multicast [15]

   o  240.0.0.0/4 and more specific - reserved [15]

4.1.1.2.  IPv6

   There is no equivalent of RFC5735 for IPv6.  This document recalls
   the prefixes that MUST not cross network boundaries and therefore
   MUST be filtered:




Durand, et al.          Expires December 21, 2012               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  BGP OPSEC                      June 2012


   o  2001:DB8::/32 and more specific - documentation [12]

   o  Prefixes more specific than 2002::/16 - 6to4 [3].  Only 2002::/16
      6to4 prefix can cross network boundaries.

   o  3FFE::/16 and more specific - was initially used for the 6Bone
      (worldwide IPv6 test network) and returned to IANA.

   o  FC00::/7 and more specific - ULA (Unique Local Addresses) [5]

   o  FE80::/10 and more specific - link-local addresses [7]

   o  FEC0::/10 and more specific - initially reserved for unicast site-
      local addresses [4].  As some networks may still use it for
      private addressing it is worth considering it when filtering
      private prefixes.

   o  FF00::/8 and more specific - multicast

   The list of IPv6 prefixes that MUST not cross network boundaries can
   be simplified as IANA allocates prefixes to RIR's only in 2000::/3
   prefix [21].  All other prefixes (ULA's, link-local, multicast... are
   outside of that prefix) and therefore the simplified list becomes:

   o  2001:DB8::/32 and more specific - documentation [12]

   o  Prefixes more specific than 2002::/16 - 6to4 [3]

   o  3FFE::/16 and more specific - was initially used for the 6Bone
      (worldwide IPv6 test network) and returned to IANA.

   o  All prefixes that are outside 2000::/3 prefix

4.1.2.  Prefixes not allocated

   IANA allocates prefixes to RIRs which in turn allocate prefixes to
   LIRs.  It is wise not to accept in the routing table prefixes that
   are not allocated.  This could mean allocation made by IANA and/or
   allocations done by RIRs.  This section details the options for
   building list of allocated prefixes at every level.  It is important
   to understand that filtering prefixes not allocated requires constant
   updates as IANA and RIRs keep allocating prefixes.  Therefore
   automation of such prefix filters is key for the success of this
   approach.  One should probably not consider solutions described in
   this section if it is not capable of maintaining updated prefix
   filters: damage would probably be worse than the intended security
   policy.

4.1.2.1.  IANA allocated prefixes filters

   IANA has allocated all the IPv4 available space.  Therefore there is
   no reason why one would keep checking prefixes are in the IANA
   allocated address space [20].  No specific filter need to be put in
   place by administrators who want to make sure that IPv4 prefixes they
   receive have been allocated by IANA.

   For IPv6, given the size of the address space, it can be seen as wise
   accepting only prefixes derived from those allocated by IANA.
   Administrators can dynamically build this list from the IANA
   allocated IPv6 space [22].  As IANA keeps allocating prefixes to
   RIRs, the aforementioned list should be checked regularly against
   changes and if they occur, prefix filter should be computed and
   pushed on network devices.  As there is delay between the time a RIR
   receives a new prefix and the moment it starts allocating portions of
   it to its LIRs, there is no need doing this step quickly and
   frequently.  At least process in place should make sure there is no
   more than one month between the time the IANA IPv6 allocated prefix
   list changes and the moment all IPv6 prefix filters have been
   updated.

   If process in place (manual or automatic) cannot guarantee that the
   list is updated regularly then it's better not to configure any
   filter.  The IPv4 experience has shown that many network operators
   implemented filters for prefixes not allocated by IANA but did not
   update them on a regular basis.  This created problems for latest
   allocations and required a extra work for RIR's that had to "de-
   boggonize" the newly allocated prefixes.

4.1.2.2.  RIR allocated prefixes filters

   A more precise check can be performed as one would like to make sure
   that prefixes they receive are being originated by the autonomous
   system which actually own the prefix.  It has been observed in the
   past that one could easily advertise someone else's prefix (or more
   specific prefixes) and create black holes or security threats.  To
   overcome that risk, administrators would need to make sure BGP
   advertisements correspond to information located in the existing
   registries.  At this stage 2 options can be considered (short and
   long term options).  They are described in the following subsections.

4.1.2.3.  Prefix filters creation from Internet Routing Registries (IRR)

   An Internet Routing Registry (IRR) is a database containing internet
   routing information, described using Routing Policy Specification
   Language objects [13].  Network engineers are given privileges to
   describe routing policies of their own networks in the IRR and



Durand, et al.          Expires December 21, 2012               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  BGP OPSEC                      June 2012


   information is published, usually publicly.  Most of Regional
   Internet Registries do also operate an IRR and can control that
   registered routes conform to allocations made.

   It is possible to use IRR information in order to build for a given
   BGP neighbor a list of prefixes, with corresponding originating
   autonomous system.  This can be done relatively easily using scripts
   and existing tools capable of retrieving this information in the
   registries.  This approach is exactly the same for both IPv4 and
   IPv6.

   The macro-algorithm for the script is described as follows.  For the
   peer that is considered, the distant network administrator has
   provided the autonomous system and may be able to provide an AS-SET
   object (aka AS-MACRO).  An AS-SET is an object which contains AS
   numbers or other AS-SET's.  An operator may create an AS-SET defining
   all the AS numbers of its customers.  A tier 1 transit provider might
   create an AS-SET describing the AS-SET of connected operators, which
   in turn describe the AS numbers of their customers.  Using recursion,
   it is possible to retrieve from an AS-SET the complete list of AS
   numbers that the peer is susceptible to announce.  For each of these
   AS numbers, it is also easy to check in the corresponding IRR all
   associated prefixes.  With these 2 mechanisms a script can build for
   a given peer the list of allowed prefixes and the AS number from
   which they should be originated.

   As prefixes, AS numbers and AS-SET's may not all be under the same
   RIR authority, a difficulty resides choosing for each object the
   appropriate IRR to poll.  Some IRR have been created and are not
   restricted to a given region or authoritative RIR.  They allow RIRs
   to publish information contained in their IRR in a common place.
   They also make it possible for any subscriber (probably under
   contract) to publish information too.  When doing requests inside
   such an IRR, it is possible to specify the source of information in
   order to have the most reliable data.  One could check the central
   registry and only check that the source is one of the 5 RIRs.  The
   probably most famous registry of that kind is the RADB [23] (Routing
   Assets Database).

   As objects in IRR's may quickly vary over time, it is important that
   prefix filters computed using this mechanism are refreshed regularly.
   A daily basis could even been considered as some routing changes must
   be done sometimes in a certain emergency and registries may be
   updated at the very last moment.  It has to be noted that this
   approach significantly increases the complexity of the router
   configurations as it can quickly add more than ten thousands
   configuration lines for some important peers.

4.1.2.4.  SIDR - Secure Inter Domain Routing

   IETF has created a working group called SIDR (Secure Inter-Domain
   Routing) in order to create an architecture to secure internet
   advertisements.  At the time this document is written, many document
   has been published and a framework is proposed so that advertisements
   can be checked against signed routing objects in RIR routing
   registries.  Implementing mechanisms proposed by this working group
   is the solution that will solve at a longer term the BGP routing
   security.  But as it may take time objects are signed and deployments
   are done such a solution will need to be combined at the time being
   with other mechanisms proposed in this document.  The rest of this
   section assumes the reader understands all technologies associated
   with SIDR.

   Each received route on a router should be checked against the RPKI
   data set: if a corresponding ROA is found and is valid then the
   prefix should be accepted.  It the ROA is found and is INVALID then
   the prefix should be discarded.  If an ROA is not found then the
   prefix should be accepted but corresponding route should be given a
   low preference.

4.1.3.  Prefixes too specific

4.1.3.1.  IPv4

   Prefixes longer than /24 are usually not announced in the IPv4
   internet [17]

4.1.3.2.  IPv6

   Prefixes longer than /48 are usually not announced in the IPv6
   internet [18]

4.1.4.  Filtering prefixes belonging to local AS

   A network SHOULD filter its own prefixes on peerings with all its
   peers (inbound direction).  This prevents local traffic (from a local
   source to a local destination) to leak over an external peering in
   case someone else is announcing the prefix over the Internet.  This
   also protects the infrastructure which may directly suffer in case
   backbone's prefix is suddenly preferred over the Internet.  To an
   extent, such filters can also be configured on a network for the
   prefixes of its downstreams in order to protect them too.  Such
   filters must be defined with caution as they can break existing
   redundancy mechanisms.  For example in case an operator has a
   multihomed customer, it should keep accepting the customer prefix
   from its peers and upstreams.  This will make it possible for the

   customer to keep accessing its operator network (and other customers)
   via the internet in case the BGP peering between the customer and the
   operator is down.

4.1.5.  Internet exchange point (IXP) LAN prefixes

4.1.5.1.  Network security

   When a network is present on an exchange point (IXP) and peers with
   other IXP members over a common subnet (IXP LAN prefix), it MUST NOT
   accept more specific prefixes for the IXP LAN prefix from any of all
   its external BGP peers.  Accepting these routes would create a black
   hole for connectivity to the IXP LAN.

   If the IXP LAN prefix is accepted as an "exact match", care needs to
   be taken to avoid other routers in the network sending IXP traffic
   towards the externally-learned IXP LAN prefix (recursive route lookup
   pointing into the wrong direction).  This can be achieved by
   preferring IGP routes before eBGP, or by using "BGP next-hop-self" on
   all routes learned on that IXP.

   If the IXP LAN prefix is accepted at all, it MUST only be accepted
   from the ASes that the IXP authorizes to announce it - which will
   usually be automatically achieved by filtering announcements by IRR
   DB.

4.1.5.2.  pMTUd and loose uRPF problem

   In order to have pMTUd working in the presence of loose uRPF, it is
   necessary that all the networks that may source traffic that could
   flow through the IXP (ie.  IXP members and their downstreams) have a
   route for the IXP LAN prefix.  This is necessary as "packet too big"
   ICMP messages sent by IXP members' routers may be sourced using an
   address of the IXP LAN prefix.  In the presence of loose uRPF, this
   ICMP packet is dropped if there is no route for the IXP LAN prefix or
   a less specific route covering IXP LAN prefix.

   Then any IXP member SHOULD make sure it has a route for the IXP LAN
   prefix or a less specific prefix on all its routers and that it
   announces the IXP LAN prefix or less specific (up to a default route)
   to its downstreams.  The announcements done for this purpose SHOULD
   pass IRR-generated filters described in Section 4.1.2.3 as well as
   "prefixes too specific" filters described in Section 4.1.3.  The
   easiest way to implement this is that the IXP itself takes care of
   the origination of its prefix and advertises it to all IXP members
   through a BGP peering.  Most likely the BGP route servers would be
   used for this.  The IXP would most likely send its entire prefix
   which would be equal or less specific than the IXP LAN prefix.

4.1.5.3.  Example

   Let's take as an example an IXP in RIPE region for IPv4.  It would be
   allocated a /22 by RIPE NCC (X.Y.0.0/22 in our example) and use a /23
   of this /22 for the IXP LAN (let say X.Y.0.0/23).  This IXP LAN
   prefix is the one used by IXP members to configure eBGP peerings.
   The IXP could also be allocated an AS number (AS64496 in our
   example).

   Any IXP member MUST make sure it filters prefixes more specific than
   X.Y.0.0/23 from all its eBGP peers.  If it received X.Y.0.0/24 or
   X.Y.0.1/24 this could seriously impact its routing.

   The IXP SHOULD originate X.Y.0.0/22 and advertise it to its members
   through its BGP route servers (configured with AS64496).

   The IXP members SHOULD accept the IXP prefix only if it passes the
   IRR generated filters (see Section 4.1.2.3)

   IXP members SHOULD then advertise X.Y.0.0/22 prefix to their
   downstreams.  This announce would pass IRR based filters as it is
   originated by the IXP.

4.1.6.  Default route

4.1.6.1.  IPv4

   0.0.0.0/0 prefix MUST NOT be announced on the Internet but it is
   usually exchanged on upstream/customer peerings.

4.1.6.2.  IPv6

   ::/0 prefix MUST NOT be announced on the Internet but it is usually
   exchanged on upstream/customer peerings.

4.2.  Prefix filtering recommendations in full routing networks

   For networks that have the full internet BGP table, some policies
   should be applied on each BGP peer for received and advertised
   routes.  It is recommended that each autonomous system configures
   rules for advertised and received routes at all its borders as this
   will protect the network and its peer even in case of
   misconfiguration.  The most commonly used filtering policy is
   proposed in this section.

4.2.1.  Filters with internet peers

4.2.1.1.  Inbound filtering

   There are basically 2 options, the loose one where no check will be
   done against RIR allocations and the strict one where it will be
   verified that announcements strictly conform to what is declared in
   routing registries.

4.2.1.1.1.  Inbound filtering loose option

   In that case, the following prefixes received from a BGP peer will be
   filtered:

   o  Prefixes not routable (Section 4.1.1)

   o  Prefixes not allocated by IANA (IPv6 only) (Section 4.1.2.1)

   o  Routes too specific (Section 4.1.3)

   o  Prefixes belonging to local AS (Section 4.1.4)

   o  Exchange points LAN prefixes (Section 4.1.5)

   o  Default route (Section 4.1.6)

4.2.1.1.2.  Inbound filtering strict option

   In that case, filters are applied to make sure advertisements
   strictly conform to what is declared in routing registries
   Section 4.1.2.2.  It must be checked that in case of script failure
   all routes are rejected.

   In addition to this, one could apply following filters beforehand in
   case routing registry used as source of information by the script is
   not fully trusted:

   o  Prefixes not routable (Section 4.1.1)

   o  Routes too specific (Section 4.1.3)

   o  Prefixes belonging to local AS (Section 4.1.4)

   o  Exchange points LAN prefixes (Section 4.1.5)

   o  Default route (Section 4.1.6)

4.2.1.2.  Outbound filtering

   Configuration in place will make sure that only appropriate prefixes
   are sent.  These can be for example prefixes belonging to the
   considered networks and those of its customers.  This can be done
   using BGP communities or many other solution.  Whatever scenario
   considered, it can be desirable that following filters are positioned
   before to avoid unwanted route announcement due to bad configuration:

   o  Prefixes not routable (Section 4.1.1)

   o  Routes too specific (Section 4.1.3)

   o  Exchange points LAN prefixes (Section 4.1.5)

   o  Default route (Section 4.1.6)

   In case it is possible to list the prefixes to be advertised, then
   just configuring the list of allowed prefixes and denying the rest is
   sufficient.

4.2.2.  Filters with customers

4.2.2.1.  Inbound filtering

   Inbound policy with end customers is pretty straightforward: only
   customers prefixes must be accepted, all others should be discarded.
   The list of accepted prefixes can be manually specified, after having
   verified that they are valid.  This validation can be done with the
   appropriate IP address management authorities.

   Same rules apply in case the customer is also a network connecting
   other customers (for example a tier 1 transit provider connecting
   service providers).  An exception can be envisaged in case it is
   known that the customer network applies strict inbound/outbound
   prefix filtering, and the number of prefixes announced by that
   network is too large to list them in the router configuration.  In
   that case filters as in Section 4.2.1.1 can be applied.

4.2.2.2.  Outbound filtering

   Outbound policy with customers may vary according to the routes
   customer wants to receive.  In the simplest possible scenario,
   customer wants to receive only the default route, which can be done
   easily by applying a filter with the default route only.

   In case the customer wants to receive the full routing (in case it is
   multihomed or if wants to have a view on the internet table), the

Internet-Draft                  BGP OPSEC                      June 2012


   following filters can be simply applied on the BGP peering:

   o  Prefixes not routable (Section 4.1.1)

   o  Routes too specific (Section 4.1.3)

   o  Default route (Section 4.1.6)

   There can be a difference for the default route that can be announced
   to the customer in addition to the full BGP table.  This can be done
   simply by removing the filter for the default route.  As the default
   route may not be present in the routing table, one may decide to
   originate it only for peerings where it has to be advertised.

4.2.3.  Filters with upstream providers

4.2.3.1.  Inbound filtering

   In case the full routing table is desired from the upstream, the
   prefix filtering to apply is more or less the same than the one for
   peers Section 4.2.1.1.  There can be a difference for the default
   route that can be desired from an upstream provider even if it
   advertises the full BGP table.  In case the upstream provider is
   supposed to announce only the default route, a simple filter will be
   applied to accept only the default prefix and nothing else.

4.2.3.2.  Outbound filtering

   The filters to be applied should not differ from the ones applied for
   internet peers (Section 4.2.1.2).

4.3.  Prefix filtering recommendations for leaf networks

4.3.1.  Inbound filtering

   The leaf network will position the filters corresponding to the
   routes it is requesting from its upstream.  In case a default route
   is requested, simple inbound filter will be applied to accept only
   that default route (Section 4.1.6).  In case the leaf network is not
   capable of listing the prefix because the amount is too large (for
   example if it requires the full internet routing table) then it
   should configure filters to avoid receiving bad announcements from
   its upstream:

   o  Prefixes not routable (Section 4.1.1)

   o  Routes too specific (Section 4.1.3)

Internet-Draft                  BGP OPSEC                      June 2012


   o  Prefixes belonging to local AS (Section 4.1.4)

   o  Default route (Section 4.1.6) depending if the route is requested
      or not

4.3.2.  Outbound filtering

   A leaf network will most likely have a very straightforward policy:
   it will only announce its local routes.  It can also configure the
   following prefixes filters described in Section 4.2.1.2 to avoid
   announcing invalid routes to its upstream provider.


5.  BGP route flap dampening

   BGP route flap dampening mechanism makes it possible to give
   penalties to routes each time they change in the BGP routing table.
   Initially this mechanism was created to protect the entire internet
   from multiple events impacting a single network.  RIPE community now
   recommends not using BGP route flap dampening [16].  Author of this
   document proposes to follow the proposal of the RIPE community.


6.  Maximum prefixes on a peering

   It is recommended to configure a limit on the number of routes to be
   accepted from a peer.  Following rules are generally recommended:

   o  From peers, it is recommended to have a limit lower than the
      number of routes in the internet.  This will shut down the BGP
      peering if the peer suddenly advertises the full table.  One can
      also configure different limits for each peer, according to the
      number of routes they are supposed to advertise.

   o  From upstreams which provide full routing, it is recommended to
      have a limit much higher than the number of routes in the
      internet.  A limit is still useful in order to protect the network
      (and in particular the routers' memory) if too many routes are
      sent by the upstream.  The limit should be chosen according to the
      number of routes that can actually be handled by routers.

   It is important to review regularly the limits that are configured as
   the internet can quickly change over time.  Some vendors propose
   mechanisms to have 2 thresholds: while the higher number specified
   will shutdown the peering, the first threshold will only trigger a
   log and can be used to passively adjust limits based on observations
   made on the network.

7.  AS-path filtering

   The following rules should be applied on BGP AS-paths:

   o  Do not accept anything other than customer's AS number from the
      customer.  Alternatively, only accept AS-paths with a single AS
      number (potentially repeated several times) from your customers.
      The latter option is easier to configure than per-customer AS-path
      filters: the default BGP logic will make sure in that case that
      the first AS number in the AS-path is the one of the peer.

   o  Do not accept overly long AS path prepending from the customer.

   o  Do not accept more than two distinct AS path numbers in the AS
      path if your customer is an ISP with customers.  This rule becomes
      useless in case prefix filters are built from registries as
      described in Section 4.1.2.3.

   o  Do not advertise prefixes with non-empty AS-path if you're not
      transit.

   o  Do not advertise prefixes with upstream AS numbers in the AS path
      to your peering AS.

   o  Do not accept private AS numbers except from customers

   o  Do not advertise private AS numbers.  Exception: Customers using
      BGP without having their own AS number must use private AS numbers
      to advertise their prefixes to their upstream.  The private AS
      number is usually provided by the upstream.

   o  Do not accept prefixes when the first AS number in the AS-path is
      not the one of the peer.  In case the peering is done toward a BGP
      route-server [25] (connection on an Internet eXchange Point - IXP)
      with transparent AS path handling, this verification needs to be
      de-activated as the first AS number will be the one of an IXP
      member whereas the peer AS number will be the one of the BGP
      route-server.


8.  BGP community scrubbing

   Optionally we can consider the following rules on BGP AS-paths:

   o  Scrub inbound communities with your AS number in the high-order
      bits - allow only those communities that customers/peers can use
      as a signaling mechanism

   o  Do not remove other communities: your customers might need them to
      communicate with upstream providers.  In particular do not
      (generally) remove the no-export community as it is usually
      announced by your peer for a certain purpose.
