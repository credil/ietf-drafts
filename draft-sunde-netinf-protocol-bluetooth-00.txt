                 The NetInf Bluetooth Convergence Layer
                draft-sunde-netinf-protocol-bluetooth-00

Abstract

   This document defines a Network of Information (NetInf) convergence
   layer intended to be used over some Bluetooth protocol providing
   reliable transmission.  A convergence layer handles the transport of
   NetInf requests and responses.  In this convergence layer the common
   NetInf messages are defined using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
   and Named Data Object (NDO) octet parts, both using length prefixes.
   While the convergence layer is intended to be used over Bluetooth,
   any underlying protocol providing reliable transmission could
   potentially be used.

1.  Introduction

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Bluetooth Convergence Layer Specification

   This section specifies a NetInf Convergence Layer
   [I-D.kutscher-icnrg-netinf-proto] intended to be used over Bluetooth.
   The protocol does not provide reliable transmission.  This is assumed
   to be provided by the underlying Bluetooth protocol, e.g. radio
   frequency communication (RFCOMM).  The Bluetooth convergence layer
   (BCL) could potentially also be used on top of non-Bluetooth
   protocols providing the required features (e.g. TCP).

   The BCL does not provide any means of discovering or selecting which
   devices to route to.  This problem must be handled by the
   implementation.  A Bluetooth connection needs to be established
   between the sender and the receiver.  This connection MAY use RFCOMM
   [RFCOMM].  It MAY be established using the service discovery protocol
   [SDAP] with the Universally Unique IDentifier [RFC4122]
   111a8500-6ae2-11e2-bcfd-0800200c9a66.

   The response to a request SHOULD be sent back using the same
   connection (if two-way communication is supported) but an
   implementation MUST NOT assume that this always is the case.

   The protocol is built around sending UTF-8 [RFC3629] encoded JSON and
   NDO octets through a stream providing reliable transmission.  All
   JSON and octet parts MUST be prefixed with their length in bytes.
   The length prefix MUST be a 32-bit signed integer encoded in two's
   complement using big endian network byte order.

   The ni URI scheme [RFC6920] MUST be supported.  Other URI schemes MAY
   be supported.

   The following names are defined for JSON name/value pairs:

   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   Name     | Value      | Comments
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   type     | string     | Message type. MUST be "publish",
            |            | "publish-response", "get", "get-response",
            |            | "search" or "search-response".
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   msgid    | string     | Message identifier.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   uri      | string     | NDO URI.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   hoplimit | number     | Number of times to forward this message.
            |            | Assumed to be 0 if not present.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   locators | [string]   | Locators to the NDO.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   ext      | object     | Metadata and future extensions. Metadata
            |            | MUST be an object under the "meta" key if
            |            | present. E.g. "ext":{"meta":{...}}
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   octets   | true/false | Flag indicating if this JSON is directly
            |            | followed by the NDO octets (including the
            |            | length prefix). Assumed to be false if
            |            | not present.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   status   | number     | Code indicating the status of a response.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   tokens   | [string]   | Tokens used in a SEARCH. MUST contain at
            |            | least one token.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   results  | [object]   | The results of a search. See Section 2.6.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

                        Figure 1: Bluetooth CL JSON

2.1.  PUBLISH

   A PUBLISH MUST start with a JSON part (including the associated
   length prefix).  The JSON part MUST include the following name/value
   pairs:

   o  type

   o  msgid

   o  uri

   Where "type" MUST be "publish" and "uri" MUST be the URI of the NDO
   being published.

   The JSON part MAY also include:

   o  hoplimit

   o  locators

   o  ext

   o  octets

   If "octets" is present and true, the JSON part MUST be followed by
   the octets of the NDO (including the associated length prefix).  If
   "octets" is not present or false, the JSON part MUST NOT be followed
   by the octets.

2.2.  PUBLISH-RESP

   A PUBLISH-RESP MUST consist of a single JSON part.  The JSON part
   MUST include the following name/value pairs:

   o  type

   o  status

   o  msgid

   Where "type" MUST be "publish-response".

2.3.  GET

   A GET MUST consist of a single JSON part.  The JSON part MUST include
   the following name/value pairs:

   o  type

   o  msgid

   o  uri

   Where "type" MUST be "get".

   The JSON part MAY also include:

   o  hoplimit

2.4.  GET-RESP

   A GET-RESP MUST start with a JSON part.  The JSON part MUST include
   the following name/value pairs:

   o  type

   o  status

   o  msgid

   o  uri

   Where "type" MUST be "get-response" and "uri" MUST be the URI
   requested NDO.

   The JSON part MAY also include:

   o  locators

   o  octets

   If "octets" is present and true, the JSON part MUST be followed by
   the octets of the requested NDO.  If "octets" is not present or
   false, the JSON part MUST NOT be followed by the octets.

2.5.  SEARCH

   A SEARCH MUST consist of a single JSON part.  The JSON part MUST
   include the following name/value pairs:

   o  type

   o  msgid

   o  results

   Where "type" MUST be "search-response".

   Each object in the "results" array represents an NDO considered to
   match the tokens included in the corresponding SEARCH.  If no
   matching NDOs were found "results" might be empty.  The following
   name/value pairs are defined for the search result objects:

   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   Name     | Value  | Comments
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   ni       | string | The ni URI of the matching NDO.
            |        | MUST be included.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   metadata | object | Metadata belonging to the matching NDO.
            |        | MAY be included.

3.  Security Considerations

   As mentioned in [I-D.kutscher-icnrg-netinf-proto] requesters SHOULD
   attempt to limit the amount of personally identifying information for
   privacy reasons.  Care should be taken when generating SEARCH tokens
   and when responding to a SEARCH.

   Validation of name-data integrity is important.  Consider a scenario
   where the connected Bluetooth devices are a number of smart phones
   that happen to be in close proximity.  The other devices can not be
   trusted to send the correct data and might even try to send malicious
   data.

   In the smart phone case battery life is also something to take into
   consideration.  By requesting data over and over again a requester
   could intentionally drain the battery of the responder.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
