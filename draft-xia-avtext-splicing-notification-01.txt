            RTP/RTCP extension for RTP Splicing Notification
               draft-xia-avtext-splicing-notification-01

Abstract

   Content splicing is a process that replaces the content of a main
   multimedia stream with other multimedia content, and delivers the
   substitutive multimedia content to the receivers for a period of
   time.  The RTP mixer is designed to handle RTP splicing in [RFC6828],
   but how the RTP mixer knows when to start and end the splicing is
   still unspecified.

   This memo defines two RTP/RTCP extensions to indicate the splicing
   related information to the RTP mixer: an RTP header extension that
   conveys the information in-band and an RTCP packet that conveys the
   information out-of-band.

Internet-Draft            Splicing Notification            February 2013


1.  Introduction

   Splicing is a process that replaces some multimedia content with
   other multimedia content and delivers the substitutive multimedia
   content to the receivers during specific, pre-designated time slot.
   Certain timing information about when to start and end the splicing
   must be first acquired by the splicer to start the splicing.  This
   document refers to this information as Splicing Metadata.

   [SCTE35] provides a method that encapsulates the Splicing Metadata
   inside the MPEG2-TS layer in cable TV systems.  But in RTP splicing
   scenario described in [RFC6828], the mixer has to decode the RTP
   packets, search and solve the Splicing Metadata inside the payloads.
   The need for such processing enhances the workload of the mixer and
   limits the size of RTP sessions the mixer can support.

   The document defines an RTP header extension [RFC5285] through which
   the main RTP sender can provide the Splicing Metadata by including it
   in the RTP packets.

   Nevertheless, the Splicing Metadata conveyed in the RTP header
   extension might not reach the mixer successfully, any splicing un-
   aware middlebox on the path between the RTP sender and the mixer
   might strip the RTP header extension.

   To increase robustness against above case, the document also defines
   a new RTCP packet type in a complementary fashion to carry the
   Splicing Metadata to the mixer even though RTCP is inherently
   unreliable too.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Most terminology defined in "Content Splicing for RTP Sessions"
   [RFC6828] applies to this document except the following one:

   Splicing Metadata

      A set of certain metadata that allows the mixer to know when to
      start and end the RTP splicing.  The information consists of a
      couple of NTP-format timestamps on the splicing in point and on
      the splicing out point.

Internet-Draft            Splicing Notification            February 2013


3.  Overview of RTP Splicing Notification

   According to RTP Splicing draft [RFC6828], a mixer is designed to do
   splicing on the RTP layer, but it cannot insert the substitutive
   content randomly but only do that at the reserved time slots set by
   the main RTP sender.  This implies the mixer must first know the
   Splicing Metadata from the main RTP sender before splicing starts.

   When a new splicing is forthcoming, the main RTP sender MUST send the
   Splicing Metadata to the mixer.  Usually, the Splicing Metadata
   SHOULD be sent more than once to against the possible packet loss.
   To enable the mixer to get the substitutive content before the
   splicing starts, the main RTP sender MUST send the Splicing Metadata
   far enough in advance.  Alternatively, the main RTP sender can
   estimate when to send the Splicing Metadata based on the round-trip
   time (RTT) following the mechanisms in section 6.4.1 of [RFC3550]
   when the mixer sends RTCP RR to the main sender.

   The substitutive sender also needs to learn the Splicing Metadata
   from the main RTP sender in advance, and thus estimates when to
   transfer the substitutive content to the mixer.  The Splicing
   Metadata could be transmitted from the main RTP sender to the
   substitutive content using some out-of-band mechanisms, the details
   how to achieve that are beyond the scope of this memo.  To ensure the
   Splicing Metadata is valid to the main RTP sender and the
   substitutive RTP sender, the two senders MUST share a common
   reference clock, so the mixer can achieve accurate splicing.

   In this document, the main RTP sender uses a couple of NTP-format
   timestamps, derived from the common reference clock, to indicate when
   to start and end the splicing to the mixer: the timestamp of the
   first substitutive RTP packet on the splicing in point, followed by
   the timestamp of the first main RTP packet on the splicing out point.

   When the substitutive RTP sender gets the Splicing Metadata, it must
   prepare the substitutive stream.  The RTP timestamp of the first
   substitutive RTP packet that would be presented on the receivers MUST
   correspond to the same time instant as the former NTP timestamp in
   the Splicing Metadata.  To enable mixer to know the first
   substitutive RTP packet it begins to output, the substitutive RTP
   sender MUST enable the mixer to know above RTP timestamp in advance,
   e.g., from prior receipt of RTCP SR message.

   When the splicing will end, the RTP timestamp of the first main RTP
   packet that would be presented on the receivers MUST correspond to
   the same time instant as the latter NTP timestamp in the Splicing
   Metadata.

4.  Conveying Splicing Metadata in RTP/RTCP extensions

   This memo defines two backwards compatible RTP extensions to convey
   the Splicing Metadata to the mixer: an RTP header extension and an
   RTCP splicing notification message.

4.1.  RTP Header Extention

   The RTP header extension mechanism defined in [RFC5285] can be
   adapted to carry the Splicing Metadata consisting of a couple of NTP-
   format timestamps.

   One variant is defined for this header extension.  The variant
   carries the lower 24-bit part of the Seconds of a NTP-format
   timestamp and the 32 bits of the Fraction of a NTP-format timestamp
   as defined in [RFC5905].  The format is shown in Figures 1.

       0                   1                   2                   3

                    Using the One-Byte Header Format


   Note that the inclusion of an RTP header extension will reduce the
   efficiency of RTP header compression.  It is RECOMMENDED that the
   main sender begins to insert the RTP header extensions into a number
   of RTP packets in advance of the splicing starting, while leaving the
   remain RTP packets unmarked.

   After the mixer intercepts the RTP header extension and derives the
   Splicing Metadata, it will generate its own stream and could not
   include the RTP header extension in outgoing packets to reduce header
   overhead.

   Furthermore, whether the in-band NTP-format timestamps are included
   or not, RTCP splicing notification message in next section MUST be

   sent to provide robustness in the case of any splicing-unaware
   middlebox that might strip RTP header extensions.

   When SDP is used, the use of the RTP header extensions defined above
   MUST be indicated as specified in [RFC5285].  Therefore, the
   following URI MUST be used:

   o  l The URI used for signalling the use of Variant B/56-bit NTP RTP
      header extension in SDP is "urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext: splicing-
      metadata-56".

4.2.  RTCP Splicing Notification Message

   Besides the RTP header extension, the main RTP sender includes the
   Splicing Metadata in an RTCP splicing notification message.

   The RTCP splicing notification message is a new RTCP packet type
   defined with PT = 211.  It has a fix header followed by a couple of
   NTP-format timestamps:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   The RSI packet includes the following fields:

   Length: 16 bits

      As defined in [RFC3550], the length of the RTCP packet in 32-bit
      words minus one, including the header and any padding.

Internet-Draft            Splicing Notification            February 2013


   SSRC: 32 bits

      The SSRC of the Main RTP Sender.

   Timestamp: 64 bits

      Indicates the wallclock time when this splicing starts and ends.
      The full-resolution NTP timestamp is used, which is a 64-bit,
      unsigned, fixed-point number with the integer part in the first 32
      bits and the fractional part in the last 32 bits.  This format is
      similar to RTCP Sender Report (Section 6.4.1 of [RFC3550]).


   A basic assumption is that the main RTP sender and the mixers are in
   an SSM group with the source being the main RTP sender.  RTCP
   splicing notification message from the main RTP sender is sent via
   multicast to the mixers.

   The RTCP splicing notification message can be appended to RTCP SR the
   main RTP sender generates in compound RTCP packets, and hence follows
   the compound RTCP rules defined in Section 6.1 in [RFC3550].

   If the use of non-compound RTCP [RFC5506] was previously negotiated
   between the sender and the mixer, the RTCP splicing notification
   message may be sent as non-compound RTCP packets.

   When the mixer intercepts the RTCP splicing notification message, it
   MAY NOT forward the message to the receivers in order to reduce RTCP
   bandwidth consumption or to avoid downstream receivers from detecting
   splicing defined in Section 4.5 in [RFC6828].


5.  Reduing Splicing Latency

   When splicing starts or ends, the mixer outputs the multimedia
   content from another sender to the receivers.  Given that the
   receivers must first acquire certain information ([RFC6285] refers to
   this information as Reference Information) to start processing the
   multimedia data, either the main RTP sender or the substitutive
   sender SHOULD provide the Reference Information align with its
   multimedia content to reduce the delay caused by acquiring the
   Reference Information.  The means by which the Reference Information
   is distributed to the receivers is out of scope of this memo.

   Another latency element is synchronization caused delay.  The
   receivers must receive enough synchronization metadata prior to
   synchronizing the separate components of the multimedia streams when
   splicing starts or ends.  Either the main RTP sender or the



Xia & Huang              Expires August 23, 2013                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            Splicing Notification            February 2013


   substitutive sender SHOULD send the synchronization metadata early
   enough so that the receivers can play out the multimedia in a
   synchronized fashion.  The mechanisms defined in [RFC6051] are
   RECOMMENDED to be adopted to reduce the possible synchronization
   delay.


6.  Failure Cases

   This section examines the implications of losing RTCP splicing
   notification message and other failure case, e.g., the RTP header
   extension is stripped on the path.

   Given there may be splicing un-aware middlebox on the path between
   the main RTP sender and the mixer, one heuristics will be used to
   verify whether or not the Splicing Metadata reaches the mixers.

   If the mixer does not get the Splicing Metadata when the splicing
   starts, it will still output the main content to the downstream
   receivers and forward the RTCP RR packets sent from downstream
   receivers to the main RTP sender.  In such case, the main RTP sender
   can learn the splicing failed.

   In a similar manner, the substitutive sender can learn the splicing
   failed if it does not receive any RTCP RR packets from downstream
   receivers when the splicing starts.

   Upon the detection of a failure, the main RTP sender or the
   substitutive sender SHOULD check the path to the failed mixer, or
   fallback to the payload specific mechanisms, e.g., MPEG-TS splicing
   solution defined in [SCTE35].


7.  SDP Signaling

   This document defines the "rtp-splicing" media attribute, which is
   used for indicating whether the main RTP sender can provide time-
   slots within its RTP flows for RTP splicing.  This attribute should
   be used in a declarative manner.  If this attribute is included in
   the SDP description, the mixer can receive the Splicing Metadata and
   implement RTP splicing.

   This document also reuses the Flow Identification (FID) semantics
   defined in SDP Grouping Framework [RFC5888] to represent the
   relationship between the main RTP stream and the substitutive RTP
   stream.

   The next example shows how the "group" attribute used with FID

   semantics can indicate RTP splicing support on RTP sender.

         Figure 3: Example SDP for a single-channel splicing scenario


   The mixer receiving the SDP message above receives one MPEG2-TS
   stream (payload 100) from the main RTP sender (with multicast
   destination address of 233.252.0.1) on port 30000, and/or receives
   another MPEG2-TS stream from the substitutive RTP sender (with
   multicast destination address of 233.252.0.2) on port 30001.  But at
   a particular point in time, the mixer only selects one stream and
   output the content from the chosen stream to the downstream
   receivers.


8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the RTP specification [RFC3550], the
   general mechanism for RTP header extensions [RFC5285] and the
   security considerations of the RTP splicing specification [RFC6828]
   apply.

   The RTP header extension defined in Section 4.1 include two NTP-
   format timestamps.  In the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
   (SRTP)[RFC3711], RTP header extensions are authenticated but not
   encrypted.  A malicious endpoint could choose to set the values in
   this header extension falsely, so as to falsely claim the splicing
   time.

   In scenarios where this is a concern, additional mechanisms MUST be
   used to protect the confidentiality of the header extension.  This

Internet-Draft            Splicing Notification            February 2013


   mechanism could be header extension encryption [SRTP-ENCR-HDR], or a
   lower-level security and authentication mechanism such as IPsec
   [RFC4301].


9.  IANA considerations

9.1.  SDP Attribute Registration

   Following the guidelines in [RFC4566], the IANA is requested to
   register one new SDP attribute:

   o  Contact name, email address and telephone number: Authors of
      RFCXXXX

   o  Attribute-name: rtp-splicing

   o  Long-form: Support RTP Splicing

   o  Type of attribute: media-level

   o  Subject to charset: no

   This attribute is used to signal that the main RTP stream can provide
   time slots for RTP splicing.  It is a property attribute, which does
   not take a value.

9.2.  RTCP Control Packet Types

   Based on the guidelines suggested in [RFC5226], a new RTCP packet
   format has been registered with the RTCP Control Packet Type (PT)
   Registry:

      Name: SNM

      Long name: Splicing Notification Message

      Value: TBA1

9.3.  RTP Compact Header Extensions

   The IANA has also registered a new RTP Compact Header Extension
   [RFC5285], according to the following:
