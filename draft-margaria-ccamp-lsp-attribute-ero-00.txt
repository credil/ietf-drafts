                          LSP Attribute in ERO
               draft-margaria-ccamp-lsp-attribute-ero-00

Abstract

   LSP attributes can be specified or recorded for whole path, but they
   cannot be specified as part of an Explicit Route Object (ERO).  This
   document extend the semantic for RSVP ERO object with a new subobject
   to carry LSP attributes.

1.  Introduction

   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) can be route-constrained by making use of the Explicit
   Route (ERO) object and related sub-objects as defined in [RFC3209],
   [RFC3473], [RFC3477], [RFC4873], [RFC4874], [RFC5520] and [RFC5553].
   This document introduce a new ERO subobject to carry LSP_ATTRIBUTES
   defined in [RFC5420] within the EXPLICIT_ROUTE.

1.1.  Contributing Authors

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

2.  Recording Attributes Per LSP

2.1.  Requirements

   LSP attribute defined [RFC5420] should be expressed in ERO and SERO
   objects.

2.2.  ERO LSP Attribute Subobject

   The ERO LSP Attributes subobject may be carried in the ERO or SERO
   object if they are present.  The subobject uses the standard format
   of an ERO subobject.

   The length is variable and content MUST be the same as for the
   LSP_ATTRIBUTE object with Attributes TLVs.

   The ERO LSP attribute subobject is defined as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |L|    Type     |     Length    |    Reserved                 |R|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      //                      Attributes TLVs                        //
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   See [RFC3209] for a description of L parameters.  The attributes TLV
   are encoded as defined in [RFC5420] section 3.

   Type  x TBD by IANA.

   Length  The Length contains the total length of the subobject in
      bytes, including the Type and Length fields.  The Length MUST be
      always divisible by 4.

   Reserved  Reserved, must be set to 0 when the subobject is inserted
      in the ERO, MUST NOT be changed when a node process the ERO and
      must be ignored on the node addressed by the preceding ERO
      subobjects

   R  This bit reflects the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE and LSP_ATTRIBUTE
      semantic.  When set indicates required LSP attributes to be
      processed by the node, when cleared the LSP attributes are not
      required as described in Section 2.3.

   Attributes TLVs  as defined in [RFC5420] section 3.

2.3.  Procedures

   As described in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] the ERO is managed as a list
   where each hop information starts with a subobject identifying an
   abstract node or link.  The LSP attribute subobject must be appended
   after the existing subobjects defined in [RFC3209], [RFC3473],
   [RFC3477], [RFC4873], [RFC4874], [RFC5520] and [RFC5553].  Several
   LSP attribute subobject MAY be present.

   If a node is processing an LSP attribute subobject and does not
   support handling of the subobject it will behave as described in
   [RFC3209] when an unrecognized ERO subobject is encountered.  This
   node will return a PathErr with error code "Routing Error" and error
   value "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" with the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object
   included, truncated (on the left) to the offending unrecognized
   subobject.

   When the R bit is set a node MUST examine the attribute TLV present
   in the subobject following the rules described in [RFC5420] section
   5.2.  When the R bit is not set a node MUST examine the attribute TLV
   present in the subobject following the rules described in [RFC5420]
   section 4.2.  If more than one ERO LSP attribute subobject having the
   R bit set is present, only the first one MUST be processed and the
   others SHOULD be ignored.  If more than one ERO LSP attribute subject
   having the R bit cleared is present, only the first one MUST be
   processed and the others SHOULD be ignored.

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  LSP Attribute ERO subobject

   IANA is requested to make the following subobject allocations from
   the "EXPLICIT_ROUTE Subobject Type" registry.


                       Sub-object type TBA

                       Name            LSP attribute

                       Reference       This document

3.2.  Existing LSP Attribute TLVs

   IANA is request to add the following information for each TLV in the
   RSVP TLV type identifier registry.

   o  Whether allowed on LSP attribute ERO subobject

   The existing registry is modified for existing TLVs.

3.2.1.  Attribute Flags

   The new TLV type definition is as follow

   o  TLV Type = 1

   o  TLV Name = Attribute Flags TLV

   o  Allowed on LSP_ATTRIBUTES object

   o  Allowed on LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object

   o  Allowed on LSP attribute ERO subobject

3.2.2.  Service ID TLV

   The new TLV type definition is as follow

   o  TLV Type = 2

   o  TLV Name = Attribute Flags TLV

   o  Allowed on LSP_ATTRIBUTES object
