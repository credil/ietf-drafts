1. Introduction 

   The IEEE Registration Authority (RA) operates under the direction 
   of the IEEE-SA Board of Governors. IEEE is recognized by ISO/IEC 
   as the authorized Registration Authority to provide this service 
   world-wide. The IEEE Registration Authority Committee (RAC) 
   provides technical oversight for the IEEE Registration Authority 
   Activities. 

   The IEEE RA administers the assignment of 24-bit identifiers, 
   formally known as an "Organizationally Unique Identifier" (OUI). 
   It can be used alone as an identifier, or used to create MAC 
   Addresses, Bluetooth Device Addresses or Ethernet Addresses.      

   Given the possibility of consuming all the MAC addresses, the 
   IEEE RAC places restrictions on their use.  While the number 
   space is large, it is not inexhaustible, and the IEEE-RAC reviews 
   trends to determine if a new strategy is required to prevent 
   exhaustion.  Current usage trends and new applications have 
   convinced the RAC that measures are needed to more efficiently 
   use the MAC address space.  This document presents the background 
   as well as the proposed changes to the OUI registries.  

1.1. History of the IEEE RA and RAC 

   The IEEE Registration Authority (RA) was formed by the IEEE 
   Standards Board in 1986 at the initiative of the IEEE P802 
   (LAN/MAN) standards group in order to register Organizationally 
   Unique Identifiers (OUI). Since that time, the activities of the 
   Registration Authority have continued to expand.  

   The IEEE Registration Authority Committee (IEEE RAC) was formed 
   in 1991 as a volunteer oversight of the IEEE staff operated RA.  
   In 1998, the IEEE RAC became a committee of the IEEE Standards 
   Association Board of Governors, (IEEE SA BoG). 

   In 1997, the IEEE Registration Authority assumed responsibility 
   for the registration of EtherType Fields, as defined in the 
   current edition of IEEE Std 802.3, and in 1998 began 
   administering Individual Address Block assignments in an effort 
   to preserve the OUI assignments and offer the option of obtaining 
   a smaller amount of addresses.

Internet-Draft        OUI Registry Restructuring         September 2013 
    

   In 2003, it assumed responsibility for administering, allocating 
   and managing the Logical Link Control (LLC) and Standard Group 
   MAC addresses. IEEE has become the single point of contact with 
   respect to all information associated with LAN addresses.  

   In 2004, IEEE established three registration authorities 
   associated with IEEE 1451.4-2004. They are:  

   o  Unique Registration Numbers (URNS) 

   o  IEEE Templates and TDL Items 

   o  Manufacturer_ID 

   On 27 April 2007, three additional registries were launched. 
   Unlike the registries launched in 2004, each registry represents 
   a different IEEE standard. 

   o  OUI-36 

   o  IEEE 802.16 Operator ID 

   o  Provider Service Identifier (PSID) 

   The IEEE Registration Authority formerly had administrative 
   responsibility for the IEEE POSIX Certification. 

1.2. Mission Statement of the IEEE RAC 

   The IEEE Registration Authority Committee (IEEE RAC) is the 
   oversight committee for the IEEE Registration Authority. 

   The IEEE RAC is international in scope, assisting standard 
   developing organizations in their establishment of unambiguous, 
   sustainable registration authorities. 

   The IEEE RAC considers the long-term interests of the ultimate 
   users of these standards, while pragmatically addressing the 
   needs of the affected organizations, industries, and the IEEE. 

    

2. Existing OUI based registries  

   The OUI ("Organizationally Unique Identifier") is defined in IEEE 
   Std 802-2001 [1] and its structure is shown in Figure 1 below 

 
 
Parsons                 Expires April 9, 2014                  [Page 4]

   with an example for use as a protocol identifier shown in Figure 
   2. 

                                            Application dependent: 
                                             | e.g., I/G or U/L 
                                             | address bit, or 
                                             | M or X bit in 
                                             | protocol ID 
                                             |   
                                             +-----+          
                                             |     | 
             +----+----+----+----+----+----+-+--+--+-+

             |----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ 
   Octet 2   |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    | 
             +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ 
    
    
                      Figure 1 - Structure of an OUI 
    
   Of note is that only 22 bits are actually assigned as there are 
   specific uses for the first two bits transmitted (the two least 
   significant bits of octet 0).  As a MAC address, the first bit 
   transmitted indicates either an individual or group address 
   (I/G), and the second bit transmitted indicates universal or 
   local administration of the address (U/L).  When used as a 
   protocol identifier (Figure 2), these bits are the M and X bits.  
   As a result of these uses, all previous OUI assignments have set 
   these two bits to 0.

          Figure 2 - Format of an OUI used as protocol identifier 
    

   While the majority of customers purchase the OUI, there are 
   currently three OUI based registries: 

   1. OUI 

   2. OUI-36 

   3. IAB 

   The latter two use an IEEE reserved OUI from the first registry 
   as their root. 

   These registries support the standards of IEEE 802 as well as 
   ISO/IEC 8802 and other standards that use unique LAN addresses.  
   IEEE has been authorized by the ISO Council to act as the 
   exclusive registration authority for the implementation of 
   International Standards in the ISO/IEC 8802 series. 

    

2.1. OUI 

   An OUI or 'company_id' is a 24-bit globally unique assigned 
   number referenced by various standards. The OUI is usually 
   concatenated with 24 or 40 bits by an Organization to create a 
   48-bit or 64-bit number that is unique to a particular piece of 
   hardware. It can be used to create MAC Addresses, Bluetooth 
   Device Addresses or Ethernet Addresses.  

   There are other uses of the OUI as well, such as its use as a 
   company identifier in the SNAP protocol.

Internet-Draft        OUI Registry Restructuring         September 2013 
    

   The OUI or 'company_id' can be used in conjunction with a number 
   of standards. It does not limit your right to use your assignment 
   for both OUI and 'company_id' purposes. 

   Additional information can be found on the IEEE RA website: 
   http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/index.html 

2.2. OUI-36 

   OUI-36 is a 36-bit identifier that can be used as an Individual 
   Address Block (IAB) or as an extended OUI. The OUI-36 may be 
   appended with four organization-supplied bits to form a 40-bit 
   Context Dependent Identifier (CDI-40), with twelve organization-
   supplied bits to form an EUI-48, or with organization-supplied 28 
   bits to form an EUI-64. Applications making use of an OUI-36 
   should make no assumptions about the bit pattern that will be 
   present in the (24-bit most-significant) OUI portion of the 
   assigned OUI-36. 

   Additional information can be found on the IEEE RA website: 
   http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui36/index.html 

    

2.3. IAB 

   An IAB is for organizations that need less than 4097 unique 48-
   bit numbers (EUI-48) and thus find it hard to justify buying 
   their own OUI. It is a particular OUI concatenated with 12 
   additional IEEE-provided bits, leaving only 12 bits for the 
   owners to assign to their (up to 4096) individual devices.  

   Unlike an OUI, which allows the assignee to assign values in 
   various different number spaces (for example, EUI-48, EUI-64, and 
   the various CDI number spaces), the IAB can only be used to 
   assign EUI-48 identifiers.  

   The Individual Address Block (IAB) can be used in conjunction 
   with a number of standards. It does not limit your right to use 
   your assignment for multiple purposes.  

   Additional information can be found on the IEEE RA website: 
   http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/iab/index.html

3. Common identifiers  

   The OUI defined in IEEE Std 802-2001 [1] can be used to generate 
   48-bit Universal LAN MAC addresses to uniquely identify Local and 
   Metropolitan Area Networks stations, and Protocol Identifiers to 
   identify public and private protocols.  A revision [3] of this 
   standard is underway (expecting to complete in late 2013) that 
   will, among other updates, also describe the 64-bit address. 

3.1. EUI-48 

   The IEEE defined 48-bit extended unique identifier (EUI-48) is a 
   concatenation of either a 24-bit Organizationally Unique 
   Identifier (OUI) value administered by the IEEE Registration 
   Authority (IEEE-RA) and a 24-bit extension identifier assigned by 
   the organization with that OUI assignment, or the concatenation 
   of a 36-bit Individual Address Block (IAB) identifier /or 36-bit 
   Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI-36)/ and a 12-bit 
   extension identifier assigned by the organization with that IAB 
   assignment. 

   Additional information can be found on the IEEE RA website: 
   http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/eui48.pdf  

 

3.2. EUI-64 

   The IEEE-defined 64-bit extended unique identifier (EUI-64) is a 
   concatenation of the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) 
   value assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority (IEEE RA) and 
   the extension identifier assigned by the organization with that 
   OUI assignment resulting in a 64-bit unique identifier. The 
   extension identifiers shall be 40 bits for the 24-bit OUI-24 and 
   28 bits for the 36-bit OUI-36. Other OUI lengths will have 
   extension identifiers making up the difference between each 
   assigned OUI length and the 64-bit EUI-64. 

   Additional information can be found on the IEEE RA website: 
   http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/eui48.pdf  

3.3. Company ID / Protocol identifier 

   IEEE Std 802 provides for the use of Protocol Identifiers in 
   conjunction with the SNAP/SAP reserved LLC address. A Protocol 
   Identifier is defined as a sequence of five octets. The first 

 
 
Parsons                 Expires April 9, 2014                  [Page 8] 
    
Internet-Draft        OUI Registry Restructuring         September 2013 
    

   three octets take the values of the three octets of the OUI in 
   order; the following two octets are administered by the OUI 
   assignee. The hexadecimal representation of the Protocol 
   Identifier consists of the hexadecimal values of the five octets 
   in order, separated by hyphens, in the order transmitted by the 
   network application, left to right. 

   Additional information can be found on the IEEE RA website: 
   http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/lanman.pdf  

    

4. Preventing exhaustion 

   Given the possibility of consuming all the MAC addresses, the 
   IEEE RAC places restrictions on their use. For new applications, 
   EUI-48 identifiers are restricted to use in low volume 
   applications, such as the identification of software interface 
   standards or hardware model numbers. 

   While the number of EUI-48 identifiers is large, it is not 
   inexhaustible, and the IEEE-RAC reviews trends to determine if a 
   new strategy is required to prevent exhaustion.  Current usage 
   trends and new applications have convinced the RAC that measures 
   are needed to more efficiently use the EUI-48 address space.   

     

4.1. IEEE RAC Prime Directive 

   A "prime directive" of the IEEE RAC is to not run out of global 
   EUI-48 addresses (previously called MAC or MAC-48 addresses) for 
   100 years.  The clock started in 1980 when this space was created 
   by Xerox (and was called Block ID at the time). 

   In about 30 years, less than 20,000 OUIs have been assigned.  So 
   if the growth is linear, there is more than 99% of the space 
   left, giving the world a 4000 year supply.  However, the growth 
   trend from last few years is not linear.  If that trend 
   continues, then there is only 26 years left before exhaustion of 
   OUIs and global address space they are used to create.  The IEEE 
   RAC is studying these trends and has considered several possible 
   causes.

Internet-Draft        OUI Registry Restructuring         September 2013 
    

4.2. New devices  

   There has been an increase in new device categories in the last 
   several years - including smart phones, tablets and various 
   sensors - all that have more than one network interface (e.g., 
   WiFi, Bluetooth, Ethernet) that requires a MAC address. 

   In addition, there are a few manufacturers that are volume users.  
   That is, they are using more than 32 million MAC (EUI-48) 
   addresses per month. 

4.3. Assignment efficiencies 

   Most manufacturers, however, use far less MAC (EUI-48) addresses 
   per month.  They either have a smaller production volume or are 
   just starting.  And actually, most OUI customers have only bought 
   one OUI.  If they need only MAC addresses, then they could 
   benefit from options that would offer them fewer. 

   This would reduce the many "lost" or "unused" MAC addresses from 
   OUIs that were assigned but the manufacturer did not use the full 
   16 million. 

4.3.1. MAC (EUI48) Addressing  

   ~260 billion EUI-48 (of ~70 trillion possible) addresses have 
   been assigned.  While the RAC knows these have not all be used in 
   devices, there is no way to confirm this.  The RAC does however, 
   require that repeat customers confirm that they have used 95% of 
   the addresses before they are assigned another OUI block.  

   The RAC requires that only one (or at most a few) global EUI-48 
   addresses be assigned to a single hardware device.  This is to 
   avoid stockpiling of addresses in devices.  However, this may be 
   problematic for some applications like virtualization 

4.3.2. Company ID 

   In order to get a Protocol identifier or company ID, an OUI must 
   be assigned.  If the manufacturer does not intend to use it for 
   addressing, then those addresses are lost. 

4.4. Virtualization 

   Virtualization from the IEEE RAC perspective is essentially the 
   usage of global MAC (EUI-48) addresses by software - instead of 

 
 
Parsons                 Expires April 9, 2014                 [Page 10] 
    
Internet-Draft        OUI Registry Restructuring         September 2013 
    

   by a hardware device (i.e., "burned in") as was originally 
   intended. 

   Traditionally the RAC limited manufacturers to only a few 
   addresses per hardware device to prevent stockpiling addresses in 
   devices.  This would invalidate virtualization solutions.  As a 
   result, the RAC is now allowing assignment of an OUI (16M EUI-48 
   addresses) for virtualization use until a further policy is 
   clarified. 

   One requirement for virtual machines is that they are mobile and 
   can be moved around on a rack, within a data center or even 
   across data centers.  Such movement in a multi-vendor environment 
   requires a globally unique MAC (EUI48) address to be scalable. 

4.4.1. Reusing addresses 

   However, another inherent nature of virtualization is the 
   creation and destruction of the virtual machine.  Hundreds, 
   thousands or millions can be created or destroyed per second in a 
   data center.  If kept in a closed environment, this requires a 
   local or reusable MAC (EUI48) address.  If a global address is 
   used, then they could be used at an alarming rate as they are not 
   defined as reusable. 

   Unfortunately, there appears to be violation of the IEEE RAC 
   policy in the virtualization sector.  That is, some are using 
   global MAC (EUI-48) addresses per rack / cluster / data center 
   and then reusing them in an adjacent rack / cluster / data 
   center. 

   Clearly this is not permitted and the RAC has been studying what 
   guidance should be given to virtualization vendors such that the 
   global MAC address space is not tainted. 

   It has been suggested that a DHCP-like mechanism or a standard 
   allocation should be developed for reusable MAC addresses such 
   that there is some order to assignment in an environment where 
   addresses are created and destroyed. 

4.4.2. EUI-128 addresses 

   Given the potential for using a large number of addresses, the 
   RAC is also exploring the feasibility of defining a new "EUI-128" 
   identifier (i.e., 128 bits) specifically for future 
   virtualization applications.

5. Proposed new OUI-based registries 

   The IEEE RAC has been studying options to restructure the OUI-
   based registries and products for over a year and is now 
   reviewing a final proposal.  This proposal provides a refinement 
   of the OUI-based registries improves efficiency of assignment 
   allocations and attempts to address virtualization issues. 

   While there was some desire for the OUI registries to fully 
   separate the semantic of protocol identifier (e.g., the 24 bits 
   assigned) and addresses (e.g., a 48-bit address created based on 
   the 24 bits assigned), the concern raised was that this was not 
   enforceable by definition.  

   The IEEE RAC conducted a survey of its customers and it quickly 
   became clear that there were first-time customers (and in most 
   cases they never made another purchase) and repeat customers 
   (many of who were volume users).  It was also very clear that the 
   dominant use was to create global MAC (EUI48) addresses.  As a 
   result, the assignment decisions could be separated as proposed 
   in Figure 3 below.

5.1. OUI-24: MAC Addresses - Large 

   The OUI-24 is a 24-bit globally unique assigned number. 

   This is the base OUI registry.  It is simply a renaming of the 
   existing OUI registry. 

   An assignment from this registry includes the ability to create: 

   o  24-bit company ID / protocol identifiers 

   o  48-bit EUI48 addresses 

   o  64-bit EUI64 addresses 

    

5.2. OUI-28: MAC Addresses - Medium 

   The OUI-28 is a 28-bit globally unique assigned number. 

   This new OUI-28 is created by the IEEE RA by assigning an 
   additional 4 bits from an OUI-24 (that would be listed as IEEE 
   reserved).   

   An assignment from this registry includes the ability to create: 

   o  48-bit EUI48 addresses 

 
 
Parsons                 Expires April 9, 2014                 [Page 14] 
    
Internet-Draft        OUI Registry Restructuring         September 2013 
    

   o  64-bit EUI64 addresses 

   Note that the IEEE RAC does not intend to define the usage of a 
   28-bit company ID / protocol identifier at this time. 

5.3. OUI-36: MAC Addresses - Small 

   The OUI-36 is a 36-bit globally unique assigned number. 

   The OUI-36 is created by the IEEE RA by assigning an additional 
   12 bits from an OUI-24 (that is listed as IEEE reserved).   

   This is the existing OUI-36 registry, and it is proposed to merge 
   the IAB registry with this as well.    

   An assignment from this registry includes the ability to create: 

   o  36-bit company ID / protocol identifiers 

   o  48-bit EUI48 addresses 

   o  64-bit EUI64 addresses 

5.4. CompanyID 

   The CompanyID is a 24-bit globally unique assigned number.  
   However, any MAC addresses created with this Company ID would 
   only be locally significant (i.e., the U/L bit is set to 1) 

   This new CompanyID is created by the IEEE RA assigning an OUI 
   with the X bit set to 1 (this bit becomes the U/L bit when used 
   to create a MAC address).  Traditionally, this use has been 
   reserved to separate the local and global address spaces but no 
   use had been defined for protocol identifiers.  It is proposed 
   that only a segment (e.g., the bottom half) of the potential 22-
   bit space be made available for allocation.    

   An assignment from this registry includes the ability to create: 

   o  24-bit company ID / protocol identifiers 

   NOTE:  This requires that legacy uses of the OUI in protocols do 
   not try to define the M and X bits for other uses.  The RAC is 
   not aware of any standard uses of the M and X bits that would 
   prevent defining this new registry.

5.4.1. Application Note 

   It is further proposed that virtualization manufacturers apply 
   for assignments of these CompanyIDs.  These could then be used to 
   create MAC (EUI48) addresses in the local space that could be 
   reused.  Additionally, it would also provide some order and allow 
   for multi-vendor usage of a subset of the local space for the 
   virtualization application (or any application that could benefit 
   from reusable addresses).  

    

6. Protocol Considerations  

   There may be unintended consequences of these additions to the 
   OUI-based registries for existing protocols.  A study and review 
   of many protocols was conducted and there were no apparent issues 
   identified. 

   IETF community input is requested, especially as it relates to 
   the embedded use or carriage of addresses or protocol identifiers 
   in other protocols.  For protocol identifiers, the IEEE RAC would  
   be interested if any protocol defines the M and X bits for other 
   uses.   

7. Security Considerations 

   There may be unintended consequences of these additions to the 
   OUI-based registries, though none are apparent. 

   IETF community input is requested. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   There may be some affect on the existing IANA registries based on 
   the restructuring of the OUI based registries. 

   However, this has not yet been studied. 

   IETF community input is requested.

9. Conclusions 

   While the background presented in this document is representative 
   of the current situation, the proposals in this document have not 
   yet been implemented, and therefore may change. 

   The IEEE-SA Board of Governors has made a decision, based on the 
   recommendation of the IEEE RAC, on the implementation of the OUI 
   registry restructuring.  A summary has been provided in this 
   document, but full details are under development by the IEEE RAC.  
   It is expected that implementation will start in 2014. 

   IETF community input is requested to identify any issues with the 
   restructuring proposal, especially as it affects IETF protocols.
