            Responsibility for Authoritative DNSSEC Mistakes
                draft-livingood-auth-dnssec-mistakes-01

Abstract

   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is now entering widespread
   deployment.  However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet
   as mature and reliable as is the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain
   administration tools and processes.  Authoritative DNS operators
   should focus on improving these processes and establishing a high
   level of quality in their work.

Internet-Draft     Responsibility for DNSSEC Mistakes     September 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS), DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC), and
   related operational practices are defined extensively [RFC1034]
   [RFC1035] [RFC4033] [RFC4034] [RFC4035] [RFC4398] [RFC4509] [RFC6781]
   [RFC5155].

   DNSSEC has now entered widespread deployment.  However, domain
   signing tools and processes are not yet as mature and reliable as is
   the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration tools and
   processes.  As a result, operators of DNS recursive resolvers, such
   as Internet Service Providers (ISPs), occasionally observe domains
   incorrectly managing DNSSEC-related resource records.  This
   mismanagement triggers DNSSEC validation failures, and then causes
   large numbers of end users to be unable to reach a domain.  Many end
   users tend interpret this as a failure of their DNS servers, and may
   switch to a non-validating resolver (reducing their security) or
   contact their ISP to complain, rather than seeing this as a failure
   on the part of the domain they wanted to reach.

   This document makes clear, however, that responsibility for these
   failures rests squarely with authoritative domain name operators, as
   noted in Section 3.


2.  Domain Validation Failures

   A domain name can fail validation for two general reasons, a
   legitimate security failure such as due to an attack or compromise of
   some sort, or as a result of misconfiguration on the part of an
   domain administrator.  As domains transition to DNSSEC the most
   likely reason for a validation failure will be due to
   misconfiguration.  Thus, domain administrators should be sure to read
   [RFC6781] in full.  They should also pay special attention to Section
   4.2, pertaining to key rollovers, which appears to be the cause of
   many recent validation failures.

   In one recent example [DNSSEC Validation Failure Analysis], a
   specific domain name failed to validate.  An investigation revealed
   that the domain's administrators performed a Key Signing Key (KSK)
   rollover by (1) generating a new key and (2) signing the domain with
   the new key.  However, they did not use a double-signing procedure
   for the KSK and a pre-publish procedure for the ZSK.  Double-signing
   refers to signing a zone with two KSKs and then updating the parent
   zone with the new DS record so that both keys are valid at the same
   time.  This meant that the domain name was signed with the new KSK,
   but it was not double-signed with the old KSK.  So, the new key was
   used for signing the zone but the old key was not.  As a result, the

   domain could not be trusted and returned an error when trying to
   reach the domain.  Thus, the domain was in a situation where the
   DNSSEC chain of trust was broken because the Delegation Signer (DS)
   record pointed to the old KSK, which was no longer used for signing
   the zone.  (A DS record provides a link in the chain of trust for
   DNSSEC from the parent zone to the child zone - in this case between
   TLD and domain name.)


3.  Responsibility for Failures

   A domain administrator is solely and completely responsible for
   managing their domain name(s) and DNS resource records.  This
   includes complete responsibility for the correctness of those
   resource records, the proper functioning of their authoritative DNS
   servers, and the correctness of DNS records linking their domain to a
   top-level domain (TLD) or other higher level domain.  The domain
   owner is also responsible for selection of the authoritative domain
   administrator, operator, or service provider.  Thus, even in cases
   where some error may be introduced by a third party, whether that is
   due to an authoritative server software vendor, software tools
   vendor, domain name registrar, or other organization, these are all
   parties that the domain administrator has selected and is responsible
   for managing successfully.

   There are some cases where the domain administrator is different than
   the domain owner.  In those cases, a domain owner has delegated
   operational responsibility to the domain administrator.  So no matter
   whether a domain owner is also the domain administrator or not, the
   domain administrator is nevertheless operationally responsible for
   the proper configuration operation of the domain.

   So in the case of a domain name failing to successfully validate,
   when this is due to a misconfiguration of the domain, that is the
   sole responsibility of the domain administrator.

   Any assistance or mitigation responses undertaken by other parties to
   mitigate the misconfiguration of a domain name by a domain
   administrator, especially operators of DNS recursive resolvers, are
   optional and at the pleasure of those parties.


4.  Comparison to Other DNS Misconfigurations

   As noted in Section 3 domain administrators are ultimately
   responsible for managing and ensuring their DNS records are
   configured correctly.  ISPs or other DNS recursive resolver operators
   cannot and should not correct misconfigured A, CNAME, MX, or other

   resource records of domains for which they are not authoritative.
   Expecting non-authoritative entities to protect domain administrators
   from any misconfiguration of resource records is therefore
   unrealistic and unreasonable, and in the long-term is harmful to the
   delegated design of the DNS and could lead to extensive operational
   instability and/or variation.


5.  Other Considerations

5.1.  Security Considerations

   Authoritative domain name operators and domain name owners, in the
   case of DNSSEC-related mistakes that cause validation failures to
   occur, should focus on correcting the issue and then improving their
   processes and tools in the future.  During the period of time that
   their domain cannot be resolved due to a DNSSEC-related mistake, they
   should not encourage end users to switch to non-validating resolvers,
   as the use of a non-validating DNS recursive resolver has
   comparatively less security capabilities than a validating resolver,
   since one implements DNS Security Extensions and one does not.  In
   addition, if an end user changes to a non-validating resolver they
   may subject themselves to increased security risks and threats
   against which DNS Security Extensions may have provided protection.

5.2.  Privacy Considerations

   There are no privacy considerations in this document.

5.3.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations in this document.
