Abstract

   E-VPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution
   for intra-subnet connectivity among hosts/VMs over an MPLS/IP
   network. However, there are scenarios in which inter-subnet
   forwarding among hosts/VMs across different IP subnets is required,
   while maintaining the multi-homing capabilities of E-VPN. This
   document describes an IRB solution based on E-VPN to address such
   requirements.

INTERNET DRAFT    IP Inter-Subnet Forwarding in E-VPN   October 22, 2012


1  Introduction

   E-VPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution
   for intra-subnet connectivity among hosts/VMs over an MPLS/IP
   network. However, there are scenarios where, in addition to intra-
   subnet forwarding, inter-subnet forwarding is required among
   hosts/VMs across different IP subnets, while maintaining the multi-
   homing capabilities of E-VPN. This document describes an IRB solution
   based on E-VPN to address such requirements.

2  Inter-Subnet Forwarding Scenarios 

   The inter-subnet forwarding scenarios for E-VPN can be divided into
   the following five categories. The last scenario, along with their
   corresponding solutions, are described in [EVPN-IPVPN-INTEROP]. The
   solutions for the first four scenarios are the focus of this
   document. For the following inter-subnet forwarding scenarios,  the
   E-VPN sites are assumed to belong to different E-VPN instances. 

   1. Connecting E-VPN sites within a DC
   2. Connecting E-VPN sites in different DCs without route aggregation
   3. Connecting E-VPN sites in different DCs with route aggregation
   4. Connecting IP-VPN sites and E-VPN sites with route aggregation
   5. Connecting IP-VPN sites and E-VPN sites without route aggregation


   In the above scenario, the term "route aggregation" refers to the
   case where for a given EVI/VRF a node situated at the WAN edge of the
   data center network behaves as a default gateway for all the
   destinations that are outside the data center. The absence of route
   aggregation refers to the scenario where a given EVI/VRF within a
   data center has (host) routes to individual VMs that are outside of
   the data center.

   In the case (4) the WAN edge node also performs route aggregation for
   all the destinations within its own data center, and acts as an
   interworking unit between E-VPN and IP VPN (it implements both E-VPN
   and IP VPN functionality).

                  Figure 2: Interoperability Use-Cases

   In what follows, we will describe scenarios 3 through 6 in more
   detail.

2.1 Connecting E-VPN NVEs within a DC

   In this scenario, connectivity is required between hosts (e.g. VMs)
   in the same data center, where those hosts belong to different IP
   subnets. All these subnets are part of the same IP VPN. Each subnet
   is associated with a single EVPN, where each such EVPN is realized by
   a collection of EVIs residing on appropriate NVEs.

   As an example, consider VM3 and VM5 of Figure 2 above. Assume that
   connectivity is required between these two VMs where VM3 belongs to
   the IP3 subnet whereas VM5 belongs to the IP5 subnet. Both IP3 and
   IP5 subnets are part of the same IP VPN. NVE2 has an EVI3 associated
   with IP3 subnet and NVE3 has an EVI5 associated with the IP5 subnet.


2.2 Connecting E-VPN NVEs in different DCs without route aggregation

   This case is similar to that of section 2.1 above albeit for the fact
   that the hosts belong to different data centers that are
   interconnected over a WAN (e.g. MPLS/IP PSN). The data centers in

INTERNET DRAFT    IP Inter-Subnet Forwarding in E-VPN   October 22, 2012


   question here are seamlessly interconnected to the WAN, i.e., the WAN
   edge does not maintain any host/VM-specific addresses in the
   forwarding path.

   As an example, consider VM3 and VM6 of Figure 2 above. Assume that
   connectivity is required between these two VMs where VM3 belongs to
   the IP3 subnet whereas VM6 belongs to the IP6 subnet. NVE2 has an
   EVI3 associated with IP3 subnet and NVE4 has an EVI6 associated with
   the IP6 subnet. Both IP3 and IP6 subnets are part of the same IP VPN.
   Both EVI3 and EVI6 have VRFs associated with that IP VPN.


2.3 Connecting E-VPN NVEs in different DCs with route aggregation

   In this scenario, connectivity is required between hosts (e.g. VMs)
   in different data centers, and those hosts belong to different IP
   subnets. What makes this case different from that of Section 2.2 is
   that (in the context of a given EVI/VRF) at least one of the data
   centers in question has a gateway as the WAN edge switch. Because of
   that, the EVIs/VRFs within each data center need not maintain (host)
   routes to individual VMs outside of the data center.

   As an example, consider VM1 and VM5 of Figure 2 above. Assume that
   connectivity is required between these two VMs where VM1 belongs to
   the IP1 subnet whereas VM5 belongs to the IP5 subnet thus IP1 and IP5
   subnets belong to the same IP VPN. NVE3 has an EVI5 associated with
   the IP5 subnet and NVE1 has an EVI1 associated with the IP1 subnet.
   Both EVI1 and EVI5 have associated with their VRFs that belong to the
   IP VPN that includes IP1 and IP5 subnets. Due to the gateway at the
   edge of DCN 1, NVE1 does not have the address of VM5 in its VRF
   table.

2.4 Connecting IP-VPN sites and E-VPN NVEs with route aggregation

   In this scenario (within a context of a particular E-VPN instance),
   connectivity is required between hosts (e.g. VMs) in a data center
   and hosts in an enterprise site that belongs to a given IP-VPN. The
   NVE within the data center is an E-VPN NVE, whereas the enterprise
   site has an IP-VPN PE. Furthermore, the data center in question has a
   gateway as the WAN edge switch. Because of that, the NVE in the data
   center does not need to maintain individual IP prefixes advertised by
   enterprise sites (by IP-VPN PEs).

   As an example, consider end-station H1 and VM2 of Figure 2. Assume
   that connectivity is required between the end-station and the VM,
   where VM2 belongs to the IP2 subnet that is realized using EVPN,
   whereas H1 belongs to an IP VPN site connected to PE1 (PE1 maintains
   an IP VPN VRF associated with that IP VPN). NVE1 has an EVI2

INTERNET DRAFT    IP Inter-Subnet Forwarding in E-VPN   October 22, 2012


   associated with the IP2 subnet. Moreover, NVE1 maintains a VRF
   associated with EVI2.  PE1 originates a VPN-IP route that covers H1.
   The gateway at the edge of DCN1 performs interworking function
   between IP-VPN and E-VPN.  As a result of this, a default route in
   the VRF associated with EVI2, pointing to the gateway as the next
   hop, and a route to the VM2  (or maybe IP2 subnet) on the H1's VRF on
   PE1 are sufficient for the connectivity between H1 and VM2.

3 Default Gateway Addressing

   To support inter-subnet forwarding, the NVE behaves as an IP Default
   Gateway from the perspective of the attached end-stations (e.g. VMs).
   Two models are possible, as discussed in [DC-MOBILITY]:

   1. All the EVIs of a given E-VPN instance use the same anycast
   default gateway IP address and the same anycast default gateway MAC
   address. On each NVE, this default gateway IP/MAC address correspond
   to the IRB interface of the EVI associated with that E-VPN instance. 

   2. Each EVI of a given E-VPN instance uses its own default gateway IP
   and MAC addresses, and these addresses are aliased to the same
   conceptual gateway through the use of the Default Gateway extended
   community as specified in [E-VPN], which is carried in the E-VPN MAC
   Advertisement routes. On each NVE, this default gateway IP/MAC
   address correspond to the IRB interface of the EVI associated with
   that E-VPN instance.

   Both of these models enable a packet forwarding paradigm where inter-
   subnet traffic can bypass the VRF processing on the egress (i.e.
   disposition) NVE. The egress NVE merely needs to perform a lookup in
   the associated EVI and forward the Ethernet frames unmodified, i.e.
   without rewriting the source MAC address.  This is different from
   traditional IRB forwarding where a packet is forwarded through the
   bridge module followed by the routing module on the ingress NVE, and
   then forwarded through the routing module followed by the bridging
   module on the egress NVE. For inter-subnet forwarding using E-VPN,
   the routing module on the egress NVE can be completely bypassed.

   It is worth noting that if the applications that are running on the
   hosts (e.g. VMs) are employing or relying on any form of MAC
   security, then the first model (i.e. using anycast addresses) would
   be required to ensure that the applications receive traffic from the
   same source MAC address that they are sending to.

INTERNET DRAFT    IP Inter-Subnet Forwarding in E-VPN   October 22, 2012


   When an E-VPN MAC advertisement route is received by the NVE, the IP
   address associated with the route is used to populate the  VRF,
   whereas the MAC address associated with the route is used to populate
   both the bridge-domain MAC table, as well as the adjacency associated
   with the IP route in the VRF. 

   When an Ethernet frame is received by an ingress NVE, it performs a
   lookup on the destination MAC address in the associated EVI. If the
   MAC address corresponds to its IRB Interface MAC address, the ingress
   NVE deduces that the packet must be inter-subnet routed. Hence, the
   ingress NVE performs an IP lookup in the associated VRF table. The
   lookup identifies both the next-hop (i.e. egress) NVE to which the
   packet must be forwarded, in addition to an adjacency that contains a
   MAC rewrite and an MPLS label stack. The MAC rewrite holds the MAC
   address associated with the destination host (as populated by the E-
   VPN MAC route), instead of the MAC address of the next-hop NVE. The
   ingress NVE then rewrites the destination MAC address in the packet
   with the address specified in the adjacency. It also rewrites the
   source MAC address with its IRB Interface MAC address. The ingress
   NVE, then, forwards the frame to the next-hop (i.e. egress) NVE after
   encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack. Note that this label
   stack includes the LSP label as well as the EVI label that was
   advertised by the egress NVE. When the MPLS encapsulated packet is
   received by the egress NVE, it uses the EVI label to identify the
   bridge-domain table. It then performs a MAC lookup in that table,
   which yields the outbound interface to which the Ethernet frame must
   be forwarded. Figure 2 below depicts the packet flow, where NVE1 and
   NVE2 are the ingress and egress NVEs, respectively.


                    NVE1                NVE2
              +------------+     +------------+
              | ...   ...  |     | ...   ...  | 
              |(EVI)-(VRF) |     |(VRF)-(EVI) |
              | .|.   .|.  |     | ...   |..| |
              +------------+     +------------+
                 ^     v                 ^  V

           VM1->-+     +-->--------------+  +->-VM2


     Figure 2: Inter-Subnet Forwarding Among E-VPN NVEs within a DC

   Note that the forwarding behavior on the egress NVE is similar to E-
   VPN intra-subnet forwarding. In other words, all the packet
   processing associated with the inter-subnet forwarding semantics is
   confined to the ingress NVE.

   It should also be noted that [E-VPN] provides different level of
   granularity for the EVI label.  Besides identifying bridge domain
   table, it can be used to identify the egress interface or a
   destination MAC address on that interface. If EVI label is used for
   egress interface or destination MAC address identification, then no
   MAC lookup is needed in the egress EVI and the packet can be directly
   forwarded to the egress interface just based on EVI label lookup. 

4.2 Among E-VPN NVEs in Different DCs Without Route Aggregation

   When an E-VPN MAC advertisement route is received by the NVE, the IP
   address associated with the route is used to populate the  VRF,
   whereas the MAC address associated with the route is used to populate
   both the bridge-domain MAC table, as well as the adjacency associated
   with the IP route in the VRF. 

   When an Ethernet frame is received by an ingress NVE, it performs a
   lookup on the destination MAC address in the associated EVI. If the
   MAC address corresponds to its IRB Interface MAC address, the ingress
   NVE deduces that the packet must be inter-subnet routed. Hence, the
   ingress NVE performs an IP lookup in the associated VRF table. The
   lookup identifies both the next-hop (i.e. egress) Gateway to which
   the packet must be forwarded, in addition to an adjacency that
   contains a MAC rewrite and an MPLS label stack. The MAC rewrite holds
   the MAC address associated with the destination host (as populated by
   the E-VPN MAC route), instead of the MAC address of the next-hop
   Gateway. The ingress NVE then rewrites the destination MAC address in
   the packet with the address specified in the adjacency. It also
   rewrites the source MAC address with its IRB Interface MAC address.
   The ingress NVE, then, forwards the frame to the next-hop (i.e.
   egress) Gateway after encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack.
   Note that this label stack includes the LSP label as well as an EVI
   label. The EVI label could be either advertised by the ingress
   Gateway, if inter-AS option B is used, or advertised by the egress
   NVE, if inter-AS option C is used. When the MPLS encapsulated packet
   is received by the ingress Gateway, the processing again differs
   depending on whether inter-AS option B or option C is employed: in
   the former case, the ingress Gateway swaps the EVI label in the
   packets with the EVI label value received from the egress Gateway. In
   the latter case, the ingress Gateway does not modify the EVI label
   and performs normal label switching on the LSP label. Similarly on
   the egress Gateway, for option B, the egress Gateway swaps the EVI
   label with the value advertised by the egress NVE. Whereas, for
   option C, the egress Gateway does not modify the EVI label, and
   performs normal label switching on the LSP label. When the MPLS
   encapsulated packet is received by the egress NVE, it uses the EVI
   label to identify the bridge-domain table. It then performs a MAC
   lookup in that table, which yields the outbound interface to which

4.3 Among E-VPN NVEs in Different DCs with Route Aggregation

   In this scenario, the NVEs within a given data center do not have
   entries for the MAC/IP addresses of hosts in remote data centers.
   Rather, the NVEs have a default IP route pointing to the WAN gateway
   for each VRF. This is accomplished by the WAN gateway advertising for
   a given E-VPN that spans multiple DC a default VPN-IP route that is
   imported by the NVEs of that E-VPN that are in the gateway's own DC.

   When an Ethernet frame is received by an ingress NVE, it performs a
   lookup on the destination MAC address in the associated EVI. If the
   MAC address corresponds to the IRB Interface MAC address, the ingress
   NVE deduces that the packet must be inter-subnet routed. Hence, the
   ingress NVE performs an IP lookup in the associated VRF table. The
   lookup, in this case, matches the default route which points to the
   local WAN gateway. The ingress NVE then rewrites the destination MAC
   address in the packet with the IRB Interface MAC address of the local
   WAN gateway. It also rewrites the source MAC address with its own IRB
   Interface MAC address. The ingress NVE, then, forwards the frame to
   the WAN gateway after encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack.
   Note that this label stack includes the LSP label as well as the IP-
   VPN label that was advertised by the local WAN gateway. When the MPLS
   encapsulated packet is received by the local WAN gateway, it uses the
   IP-VPN label to identify the VRF table. It then performs an IP lookup
   in that table. The lookup identifies both the remote WAN gateway (of
   the remote data center) to which the packet must be forwarded, in
   addition to an adjacency that contains a MAC rewrite and an MPLS
   label stack. The MAC rewrite holds the MAC address associated with
   the ultimate destination host (as populated by the E-VPN MAC route).
   The local WAN gateway then rewrites the destination MAC address in

   the packet with the address specified in the adjacency. It also
   rewrites the source MAC address with its IRB Interface MAC address.
   The local WAN gateway, then, forwards the frame to the remote WAN
   gateway after encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack. Note that
   this label stack includes the LSP label as well as a VPN label that
   was advertised by the remote WAN gateway. When the MPLS encapsulated
   packet is received by the remote WAN gateway, it simply swaps the VPN
   label with the EVI label advertised by the egress NVE. This implies
   that the remote WAN gateway must allocate the VPN label at least at
   the granularity of a (VRF, egress NVE) tuple. The remote WAN gateway
   then forward the packet to the egress NVE. The egress NVE then
   performs a MAC lookup in the EVI (identified by the received EVI
   label) to determine the outbound port to send the traffic on.

4.4 Among IP-VPN Sites and E-VPN NVEs with Route Aggregation

   In this scenario, the NVEs within a given data center do not have

   Rather, the NVEs have a default IP route pointing to the WAN gateway
   for each VRF.

   the WAN gateway after encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack.
   Note that this label stack includes the LSP label as well as the IP-
   VPN label that was advertised by the local WAN gateway. When the MPLS
   encapsulated packet is received by the local WAN gateway, it uses the
   IP-VPN label to identify the VRF table. It then performs an IP lookup
   in that table. The lookup identifies the next hop ASBR to which the
   packet must be forwarded. The local gateway in this case strips the
   Ethernet encapsulation and forwards the IP packet to the ASBR using a
   label stack comprising of an LSP label and a VPN label that was
   advertised by the ASBR. When the MPLS encapsulated packet is received
   by the ASBR, it simply swaps the VPN label with the IP-VPN label
   advertised by the egress PE. This implies that the remote WAN gateway
   must allocate the VPN label at least at the granularity of a (VRF,
   egress PE) tuple. The ASBR then forwards the packet to the egress PE.
   The egress PE then performs an IP lookup in the VRF (identified by
   the received IP-VPN label) to determine where to forward the traffic.

5 VM Mobility

5.1 VM Mobility & Optimum Forwarding for VM's Outbound Traffic

   Optimum forwarding for the VM's outbound traffic, upon VM mobility,
   can be achieved using either the anycast default Gateway MAC and IP
   addresses, or using the address aliasing as discussed in [DC-
   MOBILITY].

5.2 VM Mobility & Optimum Forwarding for VM's Inbound Traffic

   For optimum forwarding of the VM's inbound traffic, upon VM mobility,
   all the NVEs and/or IP-VPN PEs need to know the up to date location
   of the VM. Two scenarios must be considered, as discussed next.

   In what follows, we use the following terminology:

   - source NVE refers to the NVE behind which the VM used to reside
   prior to the VM mobility event.

   - target NVE refers to the new NVE behind which the VM has moved
   after the mobility event.

5.2.1 Mobility without Route Aggregation 

   In this scenario, when a target NVE detects that a MAC mobility event
   has occurred, it initiates the MAC mobility handshake in BGP as
   specified in [E-VPN]. The WAN Gateways, acting as ASBRs in this case,
   re-advertise the MAC route of the target NVE with the MAC Mobility
   extended community attribute unmodified. Because the WAN Gateway for
   a given data center re-advertises BGP routes received from the WAN
   into the data center, the source NVE will receive the MAC
   Advertisement route of the target NVE (with the next hop attribute
   adjusted depending on which inter-AS option is employed). The source
   NVE will then withdraw its original MAC Advertisement route as a
   result of evaluating the Sequence Number field of the MAC Mobility
   extended community in the received MAC Advertisement route. This is
   per the procedures already defined in [E-VPN].

5.2.2 Mobility with Route Aggregation

   This section will be completed in the next revision.
