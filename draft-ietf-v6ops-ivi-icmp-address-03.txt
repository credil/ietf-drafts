          Stateless Source Address Mapping for ICMPv6 Packets
                  draft-ietf-v6ops-ivi-icmp-address-03

Abstract

   A stateless IPv4/IPv6 translator may receive ICMPv6 packets
   containing non IPv4-translatable addresses as the source that should
   be passed across the translator as an ICMP packet directed to the
   IPv4-translatable destination.  This document presents
   recommendations for source address translation in ICMPv6 headers for
   such cases.

Internet-Draft      Source Address Mapping for ICMPv6          July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The IP/ICMP translation document of IPv4/IPv6 translation [RFC6145]
   states that "the IPv6 addresses in the ICMPv6 header may not be IPv4-
   translatable addresses and there will be no corresponding IPv4
   addresses represented of this IPv6 address.  In this case, the
   translator can do stateful translation.  A mechanism by which the
   translator can instead do stateless translation is left for future
   work."  This document presents recommendations for this case.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Problem Statement and Considerations

   When a stateless IPv4/IPv6 translator receives an ICMPv6 message
   [RFC4443] (for example "Packet Too Big") sourced from an non-IPv4-
   translatable IPv6 address, directed to an IPv4-translatable IPv6
   address, it needs to generate an ICMP message.  For the reasons
   discussed below, choosing the source IPv4 address of this ICMP
   message is problematic.

   The address used should not cause the ICMP packet to be a candidate
   for discarding, particularly in the contest of uRPF filters
   [RFC3704].  This consideration precludes the use of private IPv4
   address space [RFC1918] in this context.

   It is also a consideration that the IPv4/IPv6 translation is intended
   for use in contexts where IPv4 addresses may not be readily
   available, so it is not considered to be appropriate to use IPv4-
   translatable IPv6 addresses for all internal points in the IPv6
   network that may originate ICMPv6 messages.

   It is also an objective that it is possible for the IPv4 recipient of
   the ICMP message be able to distinguish between different IPv6 ICMPv6
   originations (for example, to support a traceroute diagnostic utility
   that provides some limited network level visibility across the IPv4/
   IPv6 translator).  This implies that an IPv4/IPv6 translator needs to
   have a pool of IPv4 addresses for mapping the source address of
   ICMPv6 packets generated from different originations, or to include
   the IPv6 source address information for mapping the source address by
   others means.

Internet-Draft      Source Address Mapping for ICMPv6          July 2012


   These considerations leads to the recommendation of using the a
   single (or small pool) of public IPv4 address as the source address
   of translated ICMP and using ICMP extension [RFC5837] to include IPv6
   address as Interface IP Address Sub-Object.


4.  ICMP Extension

   No matter a single public IPv4 address (in the IPv4 interface or a
   loopback address of the translator) or a pool of public IPv4
   addresses are used, the translator SHOULD implement ICMP extension
   defined by [RFC5837].  The resulting ICMP extension SHOULD include
   the Interface IP Address Sub-Object that specify the source IPv6
   addresses in the original ICMPv6.  When an enhanced traceroute
   application is used, it can get the real IPv6 source addresses which
   generate the ICMPv6 messages.  Therefore, it is able to traceback to
   their origins and take filtering/rate-limiting actions if necessary.


5.  Stateless Address Mapping Algorithm

   If a pool of public IPv4 addresses is configured in the translator,
   it is RECOMMENDED to randomly pick up the IPv4 public address in the
   pool.  This can somehow avoid the appearance of a routing loop to
   tools such as traceroute.  An enhanced traceroute application is
   still RECOMMENDED in order to obtain the real IPv6 source addresses
   which generate the ICMPv6 messages.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations.


7.  IANA Considerations

   None.
