    <abstract>
      <t>This document updates RFC 3315 by redefining the default
      value for SOL_MAX_RT and defining an option through which a
      DHCPv6 server can override the client's default value for
      SOL_MAX_RT with a new value.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Section 5.5 of the <xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6
      specification</xref> defines the default value of SOL_MAX_RT to
      be 120 seconds.  In some circumstances, this default will lead
      to an unacceptably high volume of aggregated traffic at a DHCPv6
      server.</t>

      <t>The change to SOL_MAX_RT is in response to DHCPv6 message
      rates observed at a DHCPv6 server in a deployment in which many
      DHCPv6 clients are sending Solicit messages but the DHCPv6
      server has been configured not to respond to those Solicit
      messages.</t>

        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

    <section title="Update to RFC 3315">
      <t>This document changes section 5.5 of <xref
      target="RFC3315">RFC 3315</xref> as follows: 

      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
OLD:
   SOL_MAX_RT      120 secs  Max Solicit timeout value

NEW:
   SOL_MAX_RT     3600 secs  Max Solicit timeout value
         ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
      </t>

      <t>With this change, a DHCPv6 client that does not receive a
      satisfactory response will send Solicit messages with the same
      initial frequency and exponential backoff as specified in
      section 17.1.2 of <xref target='RFC3315'>RFC 3315</xref>.
      However, the long term behavior of these DHCPv6 clients will be
      to send a Solicit message every 3600 seconds rather than every
      120 seconds, significantly reducing the aggregated traffic at
      the DHCPv6 server.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="SOL_MAX_RT option">
      <t>A DHCPv6 server sends the SOL_MAX_RT option to a client to
      override the default value of SOL_MAX_RT.  The value of
      SOL_MAX_RT in the option replaces the default value defined in
      <xref target='RFC3315'>RFC 3315</xref>.  One use for the
      SOL_MAX_RT option is to set a longer value for SOL_MAX_RT, which
      reduces the Solicit traffic from a client that has not received
      a response to its Solicit messages.</t>

      <t>A DHCPv6 client MUST include the SOL_MAX_RT option code in an
      <xref target='RFC3315'>Option Request option</xref> in any
      message it sends.</t>

      <t>The DHCPv6 server MAY include the SOL_MAX_RT option in any
      response it sends to a client that has included the SOL_MAX_RT
      option code in an Option Request option.  The SOL_MAX_RT option
      is sent in the main body of the message to client, not as a
      sub-option in, e.g., an <xref target="RFC3315">IA_NA, IA_TA</xref>
      or <xref target="RFC3633">IA_PD</xref> option.</t>

      <t>If a DHCPv6 client receives a message containing a SOL_MAX_RT
      option, the client MUST set its internal SOL_MAX_RT parameter to
      the value contained in the SOL_MAX_RT option.  As a result of
      receiving this option, the DHCPv6 client MUST NOT send any
      Solicit messages more frequently than allowed by the
      retransmission mechanism defined in sections 17.1.2 and 14 of
      <xref target='RFC3315'>RFC 3315</xref>.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document introduces one security consideration beyond
      those described in <xref target='RFC3315'>RFC 3315</xref>.  A
      malicious DHCPv6 server might cause a client to set its
      SOL_MAX_RT parameter to an arbitrarily high value with the
      SOL_MAX_RT option.  Assuming the client also receives a response
      from a valid DHCPv6 server, the large value for SOL_MAX_RT will
      not have any effect.</t>

      Option Codes" Registry for OPTION_SOL_MAX_RT.</t>
