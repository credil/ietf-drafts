  RTCP XR Report Block for TS Decodability Statistics Metric reporting
              draft-huang-xrblock-rtcp-xr-decodability-05

Abstract

   Transport Stream is a standard container format used in the
   transmission and storage of multimedia data.  Unicast/Multicast/
   Broadcast MPEG-TS over RTP is widely adopted in the IPTV deployment.
   This document defines an RTCP XR Report Block that allows the
   reporting of decodability statistics metrics related to transmissions
   of MPEG-TS over RTP.

Internet-Draft      RTCP XR Decodability Report Blocks         July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has
   defined a set of syntax and information consistency tests and
   resulting indicators [ETSI] recommended for the monitoring of MPEG-2
   Transport Streams (TS) [ISO-IEC.13818-1.2007].  The tests and
   corresponding indicators are grouped according to priority:

   o  First priority - Necessary for de-codability (basic monitoring)
   o  Second priority - Recommended for continuous or periodic
      monitoring
   o  Third priority - Recommended for application-dependant monitoring

   This draft is based on information consistency tests and resulting
   indicators in the [ETSI] and defines a new block type to augment
   those defined in [RFC3611] for use with Transport Stream (TS)
   [ISO-IEC.13818-1.2007].  The new block type supports reporting of the
   number of each indicator in the first and second priority;third
   priority indicators are not supported.  This new block type can be
   useful for measuring content stream or TS quality by checking TS
   header information [ETSI] and identifying the existence, and
   characterizing the severity, of bitstream packetization problem which
   may affect users' perception of a service delivered over RTP; it may
   also be useful for verifying the continued correct operation of an
   existing system management.

   The new report block is in compliance with the monitoring
   architecture specified in [MONARCH] and the Performance Metrics
   Framework [RFC6390].  The metric is applicable to any type of RTP
   application that uses TS standard format for container of multimedia
   data, for example MPEG4 TS content over RTP.


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  TR 101 290 Decodability Statistics Metric Report Block

   This block reports decodability statistics metrics beyond the
   information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  It defines
   eight metrics based on ETSI TR 101 290.  Information is reported
   about basic monitoring parameters necessary to ensure that the TS can

   be decoded including:

   o  Transport Stream Synchronization Losses
   o  Sync byte errors
   o  Continuity count errors

   and continuous monitoring parameters including:

   o  Transport errors
   o  Program Clock Reference (PCR) errors
   o  PCR repetition errors
   o  PCR discontinuity indicator errors
   o  Presentation Time Stamp (PTS) errors

   The other parameters are ignored since they are not applied to all
   the MPEG implentations.  For further information on these parameters,
   see [ETSI]

   The Decodability Metrics Block has the following format:

4.  SDP Signaling

   One new parameter is defined for the report block defined in this
   document to be used with Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566]
   using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].  It has the
   following syntax within the "rtcp-xr" attribute [RFC3611]:

   rtcp-xr-attrib =  "a=rtcp-xr:"
                     [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

      xr-format = decodability-metrics

         decodability-metrics = "decodability-metrics"

   Refer to Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for a detailed description
   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.


5.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of [RFC3611].
