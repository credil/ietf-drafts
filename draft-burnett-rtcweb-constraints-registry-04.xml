    <abstract>
      <t>Specifications in W3C's Media Capture Task Force and WebRTC Working
      Group have need of a registry in which to maintain a list of
      constrainable properties for HTML media and other constrainable objects.
      This document defines this registry.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="sec.introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>There are two W3C specifications that have need of a registry in
      which to represent constrainable properties: <xref
      target="W3C.WD-mediacapture-streams-20130903">Media Capture and
      Streams</xref> and <xref target="W3C.WD-webrtc-20130910">WebRTC 1.0:
      Real-time Communication Between Browsers</xref>. In the former, the
      getUserMedia() method on the NavigatorUserMedia interface takes a
      "constraints" argument. In the latter, the addStream() method on the
      RTCPeerConnection interface and the constructor for RTCPeerConnection
      both take optional "constraints" parameters. All three of these
      parameters make use of a data structure representing a list of
      constraints on the HTML media or media connection to be established.
      Additionally, both specifications define methods that are used to query
      the web browser about its capabilities. The returned data structure
      specifies the browser's capabilities in terms of constraints that it can
      satisfy. The data structures and their use are defined in the
      aforementioned specifications. This document specifies the registry used
      to define individual constrainable property names, their allowed values,
      and their meanings.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">
      RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec.iana" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document defines a registry "RTCWeb Constrainable Properties"
      for use by W3C specifications needing to indicate constrainable
      properties on HTML Media and other constrainable objects, both as used
      by web application authors to indicate preferences and as used by web
      browsers to indicate constrainable properties they can satisfy.</t>

      <section anchor="sec.registry.mediacon" title="RTCWeb Media Constraints">
        <t>IANA SHALL create a new name space of "RTCWeb Constrainable
        Properties". All maintenance within and additions to the contents of
        this name space MUST be according to the "Specification Required with
        Expert Review" registration policy as defined in <xref
        target="RFC5226">RFC5226</xref>. The registry is initially empty. The
        registry is defined in the remainder of this section.</t>

        <t>Each registry entry consists of a Name and a Reference (or list of
        references).</t>

        <t>An RTCWeb Constrainable Property Name MUST satisfy the following
        <xref target="RFC5234">ABNF</xref> specification:</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
rtcweb-constrainable-property = constrainable-property-name 
constrainable-property-name   = %x41-5A 0*constraint-char
constraint-char               = ALPHA / DIGIT

]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>RTCWeb Constrainable Property Names are case-sensitive.</t>

        <t>A registration request MUST include the following information:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The RTCWeb Constrainable Property Name to be registered</t>

            <t>Name and Email address of a contact person for the
            registration</t>

            <t>Organization or individuals having the change control</t>

            <t>Reference(s) to the specification(s) defining the property</t>
          </list></t>

        <section title="Designated Expert Instructions">
          <t>RTCWeb Constrainable Property Names are of unlimited length
          according to the syntax. However, it is RECOMMENDED that they be no
          longer than 80 characters in total. This is to keep them reasonable
          for humans to read and use. It is RECOMMENDED that Names use camel
          case, i.e., when a Name consists of multiple words, the first
          character of each word SHOULD be an uppercase character, with all
          others being lowercase. This recommendation only applies to the
          characters following the constraint-type.</t>

          <t>The references MUST define the following for each RTCWeb
          Constrainable Property:</t>

          <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
              <t hangText="allowed values"><vspace blankLines="0" />The
              references MUST define the allowed values for the property, for
              example an enumerated list of values or a range of integers.</t>

              <t hangText="object(s)"><vspace blankLines="0" />The references
              MUST define the object or objects for which the properties
              apply, for example a MediaStreamTrack or an
              RTCPeerConnection.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t></t>

          <t>The RTCWeb Constrainable Property MUST be well enough defined in
          the given references that it is understandable by implementors and
          application developers that will use the constraint. The property
          SHOULD NOT duplicate a condition that can be achieved using
          properties already defined in the registry. The property name SHOULD
          be appropriate and specific enough for the property.</t>

    <section anchor="sec.securityConsiderations"
             title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Since the constrainable properties envisioned for this registry are
      fairly generic in nature, it is not expected that the mere existence of
      this registry will introduce any particular security issues. Any
      specification defining one or more new properties SHOULD address any
      specific security issues that might be introduced by the properties or
      their constrainable values.</t>
