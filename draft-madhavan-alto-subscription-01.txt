Abstract

   The specification of the ALTO protocol uses map based approaches
   assuming that the information provided is static for a longer period
   of time.  But in some cases network operators reallocate IP subnets
   from time to time which in turn changes the mapping partitions[I-
   D.ietf-alto-deployments].  Since the ALTO clients are unaware of the
   map information changes, clients need to query the servers for every
   service request and many such requests are redundant because the
   information was not changed.  The purpose of this memo is to propose
   a mechanism where ALTO clients can subscribe for event notifications
   from the server

Internet-Draft              ALTO Subscription                August 2012


1.  Introduction

   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
   provide guidance to applications, which have to select one or several
   hosts from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired
   resource [RFC5693].  The requirements for ALTO are itemized in
   I-D.ietf-alto-reqs.  ALTO is realized by a client-server
   protocol.ALTO clients send queries to ALTO servers, in order to
   solicit guidance.

   ALTO clients needs to query the ALTO server for cost map and network
   map information to select one or several hosts from a set of
   candidates.  Network Maps may be stable for a longer time but changes
   whenever the service provider reallocates IP subnets.  [I-D.ietf-
   alto-deployments]

   This memo defines a mechanism for ALTO clients to subscribe to the
   ALTO server and get informed of a map information change.  The server
   MAY send only the changed map information even if clients subscribe
   for complete information.


2.  Problem Statement

   Case 1: ISPs reallocate IPv4 subnets within their infrastructure from
   time to time, partly to ensure the efficient usage of IPv4 addresses.
   The frequency of these "renumbering events" depend on the growth in
   number of subscribers and the availability of address space within
   the ISP.  In P2P networks, if this information is shared to trackers,
   then it can help the trackers to efficiently localize P2P traffic.

   Case 2: In i2aex, there are use cases for CDN and inter DC data
   transfer which need notifications of changed information between the
   ALTO clients and servers [I-D.seedorf-i2aex-alto-cdni-perpective]
   [I-D.lee-alto-ext-dc-resource]

   Case 3: Notification based mechanims provide strong cache consistency
   for ALTO caches
   [http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/83/slides/slides-83-alto-1.pdf]


3.  Protocol Structure

   The ALTO Protocol uses a simple extensible framework to convey
   network information.  In the general framework, the ALTO protocol
   will convey properties on both Network Locations and the paths
   between Network Locations.[I-D.ietf-alto-protocol].

   The Map filtering and endpoint cost services can be extended to
   include the map level and subset level expiration time.  This memo
   also extends the ALTO information services to include the
   subscription and notification service.  Any node can transmit a
   notification through HTTP to any other node for the changes in
   subscribed events.  The framework also provides mechanisms for
   subscriptions to be done for full maps or subset of the maps
   available in the Map service.

4.  Overall Operation

   The overall operation is based on the ALTO client querying the map
   information.  The ALTO server sends the map information providing
   details of full or subset level expiration.  Clients can subcsribe
   for map information changes.  ALTO server sends notifcations for the
   map information based on the subscription


5.  Definitions

   Event:Any change in a resource that can trigger a notification

   Subscription:An established relationship in which a resource has
   indicated interest in certain event

   Subscriber:A subscriber is an ALTO node that initiates a subscription
   with a subscription server

   Notification:Notification is the mechanism by which notifier nodes
   sends changed events information to the subsctiber

   Notifier:A notifier is an ALTO node which generates Notification
   messages for the purpose of notifying subscribers of the state of a
   resource.


6.  ALTO Types

   This section details the format for particular data values used for
   ALTO Subscription framework.  Base types defined by I-D.ietf-alto-
   protocol are used by this memo with some extensions listed below.

6.1.  ContactAddr

   The ALTO subscription framework requires the client nodes to provide
   the contact information which includes the transport tuple details so
   that server can send notification.  These connections may be
   persistent.

   ContactAddr is defined as:
   object {
        EndpointAddr addr;
        JSONInteger port;
      } ContactAddr;


7.  Subscription and Notification Service

   The Subcription service allows ALTO clients to subscribe to events so
   that ALTO server can return full maps or subset of the full maps
   available in the Map service.  On event changes, ALTO server sends
   notifications for the changed events.

7.1.  Requesting a Subscription

   When a subscriber wishes to subscribe to a particular state for a
   resource, it forms a HTTP POST message.This POST message will be
   confirmed with a final message, 200 OK message indicating that the
   subscription is accepted and notification message will be sent
   immediately.

   The framework allows entities to subscribe full or subset of full
   maps provided by the Map service.For example ALTO clients can

Internet-Draft              ALTO Subscription                August 2012


   subscribe for complete maps like NetworkMap, CostMaps or also for
   subsets like NetworkMapFilter, CostMapFilter or Endpoint services.
   Subscription request MUST carry "eventtype", "expires" value,
   "contactaddr" parameters encoded in the JSON object and sent as
   payload.The "eventtype" indicates what type of events subscription is
   required.The "expires" key indicates the actual duration for which
   the subscription will remain active.

   Subscribers need to provide "contactaddr" in the first subscription
   message which will be used by server nodes to send notification
   messages.

   Non-2xx final response indicates that no subscription is created and
   no notification messages will be sent.

7.1.1.  Input Parameters

   Input parameters are supplied in the entity body of the HTTP POST
   request.  This document specifies the input parameters with a data
   format indicated by a a media type "application/
   alto-subscribeinput+json", which is a JSON object of SubscribeInput:

   object {
        JSONString event-types<0....*>;
        JSONInteger expires;
        ContactAddr [AddressType]<0..*>;
        ReqFilteredNetworkMap networkfiltermap;   [OPTIONAL]
        ReqFilteredCostMap costfiltermap;         [OPTIONAL]
        ReqEndpointProp endpointprop;             [OPTIONAL]
        ReqEndpointCostMap endpointcostmap;       [OPTIONAL]
      } SubscribeInput;

   with members:

   event-types: List of event types for which subcsription needs to be
   done.  This can be "NetworkMap", "CostMap", "NetworkMapFilter",
   "CostMapFilter", "endpointprop", "endpointcost" strings.  NetworkMap
   and CostMap events subscrobes for complete information and rest of
   the event types handles subsets.

   expires: The expires value indicates the lifetime of the
   subscription.

   contactaddr: Used by the notifier to contact the subscriber for
   sending notification details.

   All the objects are optional and needs to be added based on the
   eventtype parameter.  Refer I-D.ietf-alto-protocol for

   ReqFilteredNetworkMap, ReqFilteredCostMap, ReqEndpointProp and
   ReqEndpointCostMap JSON object definitions.

7.2.  Refreshing of Subscriptions

   Subscriber can send refresh requests before a subscription expires by
   sending HTTP POST message with the same event and subscrid parameter
   returned in 200 OK message.The subscrid parameter is used to
   differentiate multiple subscriptions from the same node.

   If a request to refresh a subscription receives a "404" response,
   this indicates that the subscription has already been terminated.

7.3.  Notifier Subscription Handling

   The Notifier should check that the event specified is understood.  If
   not, notifier should send "503 Service Unavailable" response to
   indicate that the specified event is not understood.

   If the event is understood, notifier creates a subscription and
   stores the "contactaddr", event-type and expires information.Notifier
   returns a "200 OK" message which indicates that the subscription is
   succesful. 200 OK reponse message contains the "event" information,a
   unique "subscrid" parameter and "expires" value.  The subscrid
   parameter is used to differentiate multiple subscriptions.

7.3.1.  Response

   Input parameters are supplied in the entity body of the 200 OK
   message.  This document specifies the input parameters with a data
   format indicated by a a media type "application/
   alto-subscriptiondata+json".

   object {
        JSONString subscrid;
        JSONInteger expires;
        JSONString event-types<0....*>;
      } SubcriptionData;

   with members:

   subscrid: This id is sent by notifier and is used to uniquely
   identify subscription.  Refresh subscriptions and notifications MUST
   carry this id

   event-types: This should be the same received in the subscription
   request

7.4.  Notifier Notification behavior

   Notifier indicates a change in the subscribed state by sending a HTTP
   POST message with resource information, event, "substate" and
   "subscrid" parameter.The resource information can be NetworkMap,
   CostMap, NetworkMapFilter,CostMapFilter or EndPoint Service
   information.  The "substate" refers to the subscription state which
   can be "active" or "terminated".  The "substate" indicates the
   subscription state maintained by the notifier.

   If the value of the "substate" is active, the notifier should include
   an expires value indicating the time remaining for the subscription.

   If the value of the "substate" is terminated, the notifier may
   include a "reason" value.

7.4.1.  Input Parameters

   Input parameters are supplied in the entity body of the HTTP POST
   request.  This document specifies the input parameters with a data
   format indicated by a a media type "application/
   alto-notificationdata+json".

   object {
        JSONString event-type<0....*>;
        JSONString subscrid;
        JSONString substate;
        JSONInteger expires;
        InfoResourceNetworkMap networkmap;               [OPTIONAL]
        InfoResourceCostMap    costmap;                  [OPTIONAL]
        InfoResourceEndpointProperty endpointprop;       [OPTIONAL]
        InfoResourceEndpointCostMap endpointcostmap;     [OPTIONAL]
      } NotifitionData;

   with members:

   substate: Indicates the subscription state maintained by the server

   expires: Indicates the time remaining for the subscription identified
   by subscrid

   All the objects are optional and needs to be added based on the
   eventtype parameter.  Refer I-D.ietf-alto-protocol for
   InfoResourceNetworkMap, InfoResourceCostMap,
   InfoResourceEndpointProperty and InfoResourceEndpointCostMap JSON
   object definitions.

7.5.  Subscriber Notification handling

   Subscriber should check the subscrid returned in the notification
   message to check whether this is an outstanding subscription.  If
   not, it MUST return "404 Not Found" response message.

   If the substate is active, it means that the subscription is active
   and hence can check the expires value.  Subscriber can send refresh
   requests if required.

7.6.  Unsubscribing

   Unsubscription is done by sending HTTP POST message with uri as
   example.com/unsubscribe and payload containing the "subscrid" which
   needs to be terminated.

7.7.  Example

   An ALTO node [P2P Tracker] queries the ALTO server and contacts the
   peer for service.  Node wants to subscribe for resource state changes
   [Filtered Network Map].Refreshing of the subscription is done and is
   terminated later using unsubscribe option.In this example, the ALTO
   Server provides subscription, notification and unsubscribe service
   via a separate subdomain, "custom.alto.example.com".

8.  Detecting support for Subscription Service

   An Information Resource Directory indicates to ALTO Clients which
   Information Resources are made available by an ALTO Server[I-D.ietf-
   alto-protocol].  The Information Resource Directory defined by
   I-D.ietf-alto-protocol will be extended to add new directory entries
   for Subscription and Unsubscription service.

   The media-types mentions the list of all media types of information
   resources which will be sent by the Notifier.

8.1.  Example

   The following is an example Information Resource Directory returned
   by an ALTO Server.  In this example, the ALTO Server provides
   subscription, notification and unsubscribe service via a separate
   subdomain, "custom.alto.example.com".

9.  Transport Considerations

   If subscription mechanism needs to be used the ALTO nodes MUST work
   as peers.

   Input parameters and responses are encoded in the HTTP request's
   entity body, and the request uses the HTTP POST method.
