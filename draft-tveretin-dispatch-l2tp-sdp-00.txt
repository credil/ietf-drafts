1.  Usage Scenario

   Consider the interworking between plain old analog telephone and a
   SIP softphone.  Alice might use her analog telephone with a fax modem
   to call Bob, who is in an IP network with a softphone.  Alice starts
   with a voice call, a SIP gateway handles all interworking (gateway
   operation is outside the scope of this specification) and routes this
   call to Bob. Alice sends a fax and switches back to voice; Bob
   receives the fax.  Alice switches to data mode, uses text chat, sends
   a file using Zmodem, and Bob receives it.  Or Bob sends a file.  Now
   Alice starts a PPP [RFC1661] session.  To maintain connectivity with
   Bob, a tunnel (as of L2TP [RFC2661], PPTP [RFC2637], IPsec [RFC2401],
   GPRS Tunneling Protocol) is needed.

   The last thing is currently not standartised.  This document is to
   fill the gap.

   Of course, capabilites depend on actual hardware and software at both
   sides (analog telephony or ISDN, and IP) and the gateway.

   The scenario is not the only possible.  I think that "IP phones at
   both sides" will be even more common.  This will allow them to use
   SIP infrastructure (including P2P) to establish virtual private
   networks (VPNs).

   This specification intentionally treats gateways exactly as native IP
   phones.

2.  Requirements notation

Internet-Draft                  SDP+L2TP                       June 2013


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Opening a Connection: Normal Procedure

   This specification will refer to parties as an offerer and an
   answerer, as in [RFC6665].

3.1.  The Offerer Makes an Initial Offer

   The offerer sends an initial offer or a re-offer with an "m=" line
   defined here.  To introduce L2TP, the line is

      m=application 1 UDP l2tp

   The port number MUST be nonzero, although its actual value need not
   be honoured.

3.2.  The Answerer Accepts the Offer

   The answerer replies with a similar "m=" line, using a port number
   1701.  It MAY choose another port.

3.3.  Opening a Tunnel

   The offerer uses known port (from the answer), and initiates a tunnel
   with a usual SCCRQ message.  The answerer confirmes with an SCCRP.
   The offerer does SCCCN, the answerer does ZLB ACK.  Parties SHOULD
   open only one tunnel.

3.4.  Opening a Session

   The offerer starts with ICRQ, assuming the role of LAC, whether it is
   a native IP terminal or a gateway.  Parties SHOULD open only one
   session.

4.  Opening a Connection: Failure

   If the answerer does not recognize or does not support "application/
   l2tp", it replies as in [RFC6665].

5.  Terminating Procedures

   SDP dialog and L2TP tunnel and session are loosely coupled.  Thus,
   terminating a session does not imply closing a tunnel nor L2TP
   session.  Parties MUST continue to operate L2TP even if SIP (or
   other) session terminates.  They may tear down the tunnel, of course.

   Indeed, the party that wishes to terminate the session will do this
   almost simultaneously.

   Likewise, if L2TP tunnel stops (with StopCCN), parties are not
   obliged to stop the dialog.  Next re-offer may trigger re-opening.

6.  Re-opening Procedures

   In some cases e.g. roaming, or when dynamic IP address changes, a
   tunnel must be reestablished.  Then, a party SHOULD use the
   following.  Break existing L2TP tunnel, then re-offer SDP with new IP
   address.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo registers an MIME or SDP media type:

   o  Media type name: application

   o  Subtype name: l2tp

   o  Required parameters: none

   o  Optional parameter: none

   o  Encoding considerations: This type is only defined for transfer
      via RTP

   o  Security considerations: see RFC, section 8

   o  Interoperability considerations: none

   o  Pubished specification: RFC

   o  Applications which use this media type: IP telephones and
      softphones, and IP-PSTN gateways

   o  Additional Information: Not expected to be stored in files.

   o  Person & e-mail address to contact for further information: Anton
      Tveretin, fas_vm@surguttel.ru

   o  Intended usage: COMMON

   o  Restrictions on usage: none

   o  Author/Change controller: The IETF

8.  Security Considerations

   Due to intended usage, parties of L2TP tunnels may not have each
   other credentials, and so rely on external (e.g. SIP) authentication.
   Also, a description may be intercepted by third party.

   All security will be limited by a gateway, if any, rather than end-
   to-end.
