		<abstract>
			<t>The current work of SIPREC will soon finish. As its charter defined, SIPREC has covered industries like financial trading floors, contact center and emergency service bureaus. But when talking about products or solutions like data or web conferencing, SIPREC is insufficient to record all aspects of calls with different interactive media channels. This draft tries to show a use case for web conference recording and show how it can work well under SIPREC mechanism.</t>

		<section title="Web Conference">
			<t>In general, a basic video conference has participants with video channels and audio channels with DTMF ability. A more complex multimedia conference would have text, interactive text and presentation graphics [RFC4597]. A web conference, known as a webinar or, for interactive conferences, online workshop, refers to a service that allows conferencing events to be shared with remote locations. It has needs for recording as strong as those for financial trading floors and contact centers. The host and participants, and even nonparticipants, would like to play back the conference recording for further purposes, like editing a conference summary, reviewing conference outlines or replaying the whole conference process. The recording should reconstruct, as much as possible, the web conference including all media types not only audio/video but also IM, data sharing and even presentation information like layout. Such an exhaustive reconstruction could give audiences more information and a better experience.</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Multimedia Recording and Layout">
	          	<t>There is one use case covering the recording of a multi-channel and multimedia session in the existing use case document [RFC6341]. Aside from audio, video and IM, it does not mention other interaction modalities. The limitations of the multi-channel typies leads to poor support for web conference recording. A web conference has various media types, including audio, video, IM, data sharing(desktop/document/application/whiteboard) and polling. SIPREC is already mostly capable of recording any sort of RTP media sessions, including voice, DTMF, video, and text [RFC6341] with SDP negotiation <xref target="I-D.ietf-siprec-protocol"/>. But it is not evident how to support the remaining media.</t>
	          	<t>The media streams like desktop/document/application/whiteboard sharing could be managed as still images (snapshots with increments) or as dynamic streams (video streams) to cover details like annotating, direct editing or page turning. The still image could be also treated as the payload in rtp stream. For instance, one snapshot bitmap from desktop could be inserted as an I frame of a recording RTP stream that uses the SIP recording mechanism. So those streams could be recorded via RTP stream.</t>
			<t>In many cases the conference server controls the layout views of media data, especially for video streams, on the screens of the participants in the conference. In addition, participants or conference host might change the layout for their preferred pane assignment. When participants act the SRC and make the recording for themselves, they might use their own layout for special purpose, like put the IM session into the larger pane temporarily for writing some key details into a summary, or permanently close the less significant participants' video stream outputs to earn a larger pane for slide sharing of a online class training . It would be useful to have information about how that was done for each participant, and the recommended way of doing it for after-the-fact viewers, as part of the recording, so that the playbacks can do a proper rendering.</t>
			<t>The layout of a web conference is used to decide how to organize the multi-windows, when playing back the recording, considered as a set of predefined video presentations offered by the server [RFC4597]. Take video recording as an example. There are some key crucial factors, like the desired recording resolution or largest active speaker, that affect SRC/SRS decisions about how many video streams (participants) are viewed at once and the layout of these video streams on the screen [RFC4597]. And the data sharing's content [RFC4796] could also effect the layout in a web conference when presenting with video channels together. These layout metadata could be defined by SRC or by config/default setting on SRS. If it is defined by SRC, the metadata could be delivered to SRS at the beginning of the RS, and updated with the increments later.</t> 
			<t>Below is a simple example for the layout of a web conference. A is for participant list, B is for IM, while C is for desktop sharing. And D1, D2, D3 are to support different video windows from each participant.</t>

		<section title="Recording Session">
			<t>One way for a conference focus to record a conference is introduced in <xref target="I-D.ietf-siprec-architecture"/>. This defines how the conference focus works as an SRC to deliver RTP streams and associate recording metadata to SRS. It may choose the recording RTP stream type, separated or mixed. There are more details about how to use SDP, RTP for recording by participant or by media type in <xref target="I-D.ietf-siprec-protocol"/>. The focus may setup different recording sessions for different media streams recorded separately, or one recording session for a mixed media stream created by the SRC, or even multiplexing different media streams in a single RTP recording session<xref target="I-D.ietf-siprec-protocol"/>.</t>
			<t>But more is needed to support other media streams in a web conference. There is need for a new type of "media stream" for data sharing, distinct from the main video streams, with different m-lines or metadata. Other new "media stream" types are needed for delivery of SIP based IM message and polling message. There is also need of a mechanism for the SRC to bound the number of media streams to be recorded, especially when the participant number in a conference is large. </t>
			<t>Recording XMPP based IM in CS is out of the scope for this proposal. It may be added later.</t>
