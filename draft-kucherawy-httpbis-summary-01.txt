Internet-Draft          HTTP/1.1 Document Series              March 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document summarizes the series of documents comprising the
   definition of HTTP/1.1.  A synopsis of each document is provided, as
   well as an enumeration of the key definitions (and, thus, their
   corresponding IANA actions) and security topics each one contains.
   This is intended to serve as a super table of contents for the
   series.

   Future documents wishing to make general reference to HTTP/1.1 should
   refer to this document and not each document in the series.

2.  Documents

2.1.  Part 1: URIs, Connections, and Message Parsing

   Part 1 ([HTTP-PART-1]) provides an overview of HTTP and its
   associated terminology, defines the "http" and "https" Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) schemes, defines the generic message syntax
   and parsing requirements for HTTP message frames, and describes
   general security concerns for implementations.

   IANA actions in this document:

   o  Registration of the following HTTP-specific header fields:

      *  Close

      *  Connection

      *  Content-Length

      *  Host

      *  TE

      *  Trailer

      *  Transfer-Encoding

      *  Upgrade

      *  Via

   o  Registration of the "http" and "https" URI schemes

   o  Registration of the "message/http" and "application/http" media
      types

   o  Creates the HTTP Transfer Coding Registry and creates its initial
      entries

   o  Creates the HTTP Upgrade Token Registry and creates its initial
      entries

   Security considerations include:

   o  Personal information

   o  Abuse of server log information

   o  Attacks based on file and path names

   o  DNS-related attacks

   o  Intermediaries and caching

   o  Protocol element size overflows

2.2.  Part 2: Message Semantics

   Part 2 ([HTTP-PART-2]) defines the semantics of HTTP messages as
   expressed by request methods, request header fields, response status
   codes, and response header fields.

   IANA actions in this document:

   o  Creation of the HTTP Request Method Registry and registration of
      its initial entries

   o  Creation of the HTTP Status Code Registry and registration of its
      initial entries

   o  Registration of the following HTTP-specific header fields:

      *  Allow

      *  Date

      *  Expect

      *  From

      *  Location

      *  Max-Forwards

      *  User-Agent

   Security considerations include:

   o  Transfer of sensitive information

   o  Encoding sensitive information in URIs

   o  Location header fields: spoofing an information leakage

   o  Issuse with the CONNECT method

2.3.  Part 3: Message Payload and Content Negotiation

   Part 3 ([HTTP-PART-3]) defines HTTP message content, metadata, and
   content negotiation.

   IANA actions in this document:

   o  Registration of the following HTTP-specific header fields:

      *  Accept

      *  Accept-Charset

      *  Accept-Encoding

      *  Content-Type

      *  MIME-Version

   o  Creates the HTTP Content Codings registry and defines its initial
      values

   o  Privacy issues connected to Accept header fields

2.4.  Part 4: Conditional Requests
