Extensions to Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) for
                  handling Link Bandwidth Utilization
                draft-wu-pce-pcep-link-bw-utilization-00

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.

   Link bandwidth utilization considering the total bandwidth of a link
   in current use for the forwarding is an important factor to consider
   during path computation.  This document describes extensions to PCEP
   to consider them as new constraints during path computation.

Internet-Draft           TE Link BW Utilization             October 2013


1.  Introduction

   Real time link bandwidth utilization is becoming critical in the path
   computation in some networks.  It is important that link bandwidth
   utilization is factored in during path computation.  PCC can request
   a PCE to provide a path such that it selects under-utilized links.
   This document extends PCEP [RFC5440] for this purpose.

   Traffic Engineering Database (TED) as populated by Interior Gateway
   Protocol (IGP) contains Maximum bandwidth, Maximum reservable
   bandwidth and Unreserved bandwidth ([RFC3630] and [RFC3784]).
   [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS] further populate Residual
   bandwidth and Available bandwidth.  Further [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS] also
   define Bandwidth Utilization.

   [Editors Note: [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] should also be extended in future
   version for real time link bandwidth utilization]

   The links in the path MAY be monitored for changes in the link
   bandwidth utilization, re-optimization of such path MAY be further
   requested.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   IGP:  Interior Gateway Protocol.  Either of the two routing
      protocols, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Intermediate System
      to Intermediate System (IS-IS).

   PCC:  Path Computation Client: any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Protocol.

Internet-Draft           TE Link BW Utilization             October 2013


   RSVP:  Resource Reservation Protocol

   TE LSP:  Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path.

3.  Link Bandwidth Utilization (LBU)

   The bandwidth utilization on a link, forwarding adjacency, or bundled
   link is populated in the TED (Bandwidth Utilization in
   [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS]).  For a link or forwarding adjacency, bandwidth
   utilization represent the actual utilization of the link (i.e.: as
   measured in the router).  For a bundled link, bandwidth utilization
   is defined to be the sum of the component link bandwidth utilization.
   This includes traffic for both RSVP and non-RSVP.

   LBU Percentage is described as the (LBU / Maximum bandwidth) * 100.

4.  Link Reserved Bandwidth Utilization (LRBU)

   The reserved bandwidth utilization on a link, forwarding adjacency,
   or bundled link can be calculated from the TED.  This includes
   traffic for only RSVP-TE LSPs.

   LRBU can be calculated by using the Residual bandwidth, available
   bandwidth and LBU.  The actual bandwidth by non-RSVP TE traffic can
   be calculated by subtracting Available Bandwidth from Residual
   Bandwidth.  Once we have the actual bandwidth for non-RSVP TE
   traffic, subtracting this from LBU would result in LRBU.

   LRBU Percentage is described as the (LRBU / (current reserved
   bandwidth)) * 100; where the current reserved bandwidth can be
   calculated by subtracting Residual bandwidth from Maximum bandwidth.

5.  PCEP Requirements

   Following requirements associated with bandwidth utilization are
   identified for PCEP:

   1.  PCE supporting this draft MUST have the capability to compute
       end-to-end path with bandwidth utilization constraints.  It MUST
       also support the combination of bandwidth utilization constraint
       with existing constraints (cost, hop-limit...).

   2.  PCC MUST be able to request for bandwidth utilization constraint
       in PCReq message as the boundary condition that should not be
       crossed for each link in the path.

   3.  PCC MUST be able to request for bandwidth utilization constraint
       in PCReq message as an Objective function (OF) [RFC5541] to be

Internet-Draft           TE Link BW Utilization             October 2013


       optimized.

   4.  PCEs are not required to support bandwidth utilization
       constraint.  Therefore, it MUST be possible for a PCE to reject a
       PCReq message with a reason code that indicates no support for
       bandwidth utilization constraint.

   5.  PCEP SHOULD provide mechanism to handle bandwidth utilization
       constraint in multi-domain (e.g., Inter-AS, Inter-Area or Multi-
       Layer) environment.

6.  PCEP Extensions

   This section defines extensions to PCEP [RFC5440] for requirements
   outlined in Section 5.  The proposed solution is used to consider
   bandwidth utilization during path computation.

6.1.  BU Object

   The BU (Bandwidth Utilization) is used to indicate the upper limit of
   the acceptable link bandwidth utilization percentage.

   The BU object may be carried within the PCReq message and PCRep
   messages.

   BU Object-Class is TBD.

   Two Object-Type values are defined for the BU object:

   o  Link Bandwidth Utilization (LBU): BU Object-Type is 1.

   o  Link Reserved Bandwidth Utilization (LRBU): BU Object-Type is 2.

   The format of the BU object body is as follows:

          0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                      Bandwidth Utilization                    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                           BU Object Body Format

   Bandwidth utilization (32 bits):  Represents the bandwidth
      utilization quantified as a percentage (as described in Section 3
      and Section 4).  The basic unit is 0.000000023%, with the maximum
      value 4,294,967,295 representing 98.784247785% (4,294,967,295 *
      0.000000023%).  This value is the maximum Bandwidth utilization

Internet-Draft           TE Link BW Utilization             October 2013


      percentage that can be expressed.

   The BU object body has a fixed length of 4 bytes.

6.1.1.  Elements of Procedure

   PCC SHOULD request the PCE to factor in the bandwidth utilization
   during path computation by including a BU object in the PCReq
   message.

   Multiple BU objects MAY be inserted in a PCReq or a PCRep message for
   a given request but there MUST be at most one instance of the BU
   object for each object type.  If, for a given request, two or more
   instances of a BU object with the same object type are present, only
   the first instance MUST be considered and other instances MUST be
   ignored.

   BU object MAY be carried in a PCRep message in case of unsuccessful
   path computation along with a NO-PATH object to indicate the
   constraints that could not be satisfied.

   If the P bit is clear in the object header and PCE does not
   understand or does not support bandwidth utilization during path
   computation it SHOULD simply ignore BU object.

   If the P Bit is set in the object header and PCE receives BU object
   in path request and it understands the BU object, but the PCE is not
   capable of bandwidth utilization check during path computation, the
   PCE MUST send a PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR Object Error-Type = 4
   (Not supported object) [RFC5440].  The path computation request MUST
   then be cancelled.

   If the PCE does not understand the BU object, then the PCE MUST send
   a PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR Object Error-Type = 3 (Unknown
   object) [RFC5440].

6.2.  New Objective Functions

   This document defines two additional objective functions -- namely,
   MUP (Maximum Under-Utilized Path) and MRUP (Maximum Reserved Under-
   Utilized Path.  Hence two new objective function codes have to be
   defined.

   Objective functions are formulated using the following terminology:

   o  A network comprises a set of N links {Li, (i=1...N)}.





Wu, et al.               Expires April 18, 2014                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           TE Link BW Utilization             October 2013


   o  A path P is a list of K links {Lpi,(i=1...K)}.

   o  Bandwidth Utilization on link L is denoted u(L).

   o  Reserved Bandwidth Utilization on link L is denoted ru(L).

   o  Maximum bandwidth on link L is denoted M(L).

   o  Current Reserved bandwidth on link L is denoted c(L).

   The description of the two new objective functions is as follows.

   Objective Function Code:  TBD



         Name: Maximum Under-Utilized Path (MUP)

         Description: Find a path P such that (Min {(M(Lpi)- u(Lpi)) /
         M(Lpi), i=1...K } ) is maximized.

   Objective Function Code:  TBD



         Name: Maximum Reserved Under-Utilized Path (MRUP)

         Description: Find a path P such that (Min {(c(Lpi)- ru(Lpi)) /
         c(Lpi), i=1...K } ) is maximized.

   These new objective function are used to optimize paths based on
   bandwidth utilization as the optimization criteria.

   If the objective function defined in this document are unknown/
   unsupported, the procedure as defined in [RFC5541] is followed.

6.3.  PCEP Message

   The new optional BU objects MAY be specified in the PCReq message.
   As per [RFC5541], an OF object specifying a new objective function
   MAY also be specified.

   The format of the PCReq message (with [RFC5541] as a base) is updated
   as follows:

7.  Other Considerations

7.1.  Reoptimization Consideration

   PCC can monitor the link bandwidth utilization of the setup LSPs and
   in case of drastic change, it MAY ask PCE for reoptimization as per
   [RFC5440].

7.2.  Inter-domain Consideration

7.3.  P2MP Consideration

7.4.  Stateful PCE

8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

9.  Security Considerations

   TBD

10.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a new BU object and OF codes which does not add
   any new security concerns beyond those discussed in [RFC5440].

11.  Manageability Considerations

11.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   The only configurable item is the support of the new constraints on a
   PCE which MAY be controlled by a policy module.  If the new
   constraints are not supported/allowed on a PCE, it MUST send a PCErr
   message as specified in Section 6.1.1.

11.2.  Information and Data Models

   [PCEP-MIB] describes the PCEP MIB, there are no new MIB Objects for
   this document.

11.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

11.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440].

11.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   PCE requires the TED to be populated with the bandwidth utilization.
   This mechanism is described in [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] or
   [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS].
