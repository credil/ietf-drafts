	With a mandated default minimum maximum UDP message size of
	512 octets, the DNS protocol presents some special problems
	for zones wishing to expose a moderate or high number of
	authority servers (NS RRs).
	This document explains the operational issues caused by,
	or related to this response size limit, and suggests ways
	to optimize the use of this limited space.
	Guidance is offered to DNS server implementors and to DNS zone
	operators.

    <section title="Introduction and Overview">	<!-- 1 -->
<!--      <section title="Introduction and Overview">  -->
	<t>	<!-- 1.1 -->
	The original DNS standard limited the UDP message size to 512 octets
	(see Section 4.2.1 of <xref target="RFC1035"/>).
	Even though this limitation was due to the required minimum
	IP reassembly limit for IPv4, it became a hard DNS protocol limit
	and is not implicitly relaxed by changes in a network layer protocol,
	for example to IPv6.
	</t>
	<t>	<!-- 1.2 -->
	The EDNS (Extension Mechanisms for DNS) protocol extension starting
	with version 0 permits larger
	responses by mutual agreement of the requester and responder
	(see Section 4.3 and Section 6.2 of <xref target="RFC2671bis"/>),
	and it is recommended to support EDNS.
	The 512 octets UDP message size limit will remain in
	practical effect until virtually all DNS servers and resolvers
	support EDNS.
	</t>
	<t>	<!-- 1.3 -->
	Since DNS responses include a copy of the request, the space
	available for response data is somewhat less than the full 512 octets.
	Negative responses are quite small, but for positive and referral
	responses, every octet must be carefully and sparingly allocated.
	While the response size of positive responses is 
	also a concern in <xref target="RFC3226"/>,
	this document specifically addresses referral response size.
	</t>
	<t>	<!-- 1.4 -->
	While more than twelve years passed since the publication of the
	original EDNS0 document <xref target="RFC2671"/>, 
	approximately 65% of the clients support it
	as observed at a root name server and this fraction has not changed
	in recent few years. 
	The long tail of EDNS deployment may eventually be measured
	in decades.
	</t>
	<t>	<!-- 1.5 -->
	Even if EDNS deployment reached 100% of all DNS initiators and
	responders there will still be cases when path MTU limitations or IP
	fragmentation/reassembly problems in firewalls and other middleboxes
	will cause EDNS failures which leads to non-extended DNS retries.
	A smaller referral response will always be better than a larger one
	if the same end result can be achieved either way.
	See <xref target="RFC5625"/>, <xref target="SSAC035"/>,
	and Section 6.2.6 of <xref target="RFC2671bis"/> for details.

      <section anchor="aa" title="Relevant Protocol Elements">	<!-- 2.1 -->
      <t>	<!-- 2.1.1 -->
	A positive delegation response will include the following elements:
	<vspace blankLines="1" />
	<list hangIndent="4" style="empty">
          <t>Header Section: fixed length (12 octets)</t>
	  <t>Question Section: original query (name, class, type)</t>
	  <t>Answer Section: empty, or a CNAME/DNAME chain</t>
	  <t>Authority Section: NS RRset (nameserver names)</t>
	  <t>Additional Section: A and AAAA RRsets (nameserver addresses)</t>
	</list>
	Note: CNAME defines a canonical name (<xref target="RFC1034"/>)
	while DNAME maps an entire subtree to another domain
	(<xref target="RFC2672"/>).
      </t>
      <t>	<!-- 2.1.2 -->
	If the total size of the UDP response exceeds 512 octets or
	the size advertised in EDNS, 
	and if the data that does not fit was "required",
	then the TC bit will be set (indicating truncation).
	This will usually cause the requester to retry using TCP,
	depending on what information was desired and what information
	was omitted.
	For example, truncation in the authority section is of no interest
	to a stub resolver who only plans to consume the answer section.
	If a retry using TCP is needed, the total cost of the transaction
	is much higher.
	See Section 6.1.3.2 of <xref target="RFC1123"/>
	for details on the requirement
	that UDP be attempted before falling back to TCP.
      </t>
      <t>	<!-- 2.1.3 -->
	RRsets (Resource Record Set, see <xref target="RFC2136"/>)
	are never sent partially unless the TC bit is set to
	indicate truncation.
	When the TC bit is set, the final apparent RRset in the final
	non-empty section must be considered "possibly damaged"
	(see Section 6.2 of <xref target="RFC1035"/> and
	Section 9 of <xref target="RFC2181"/>).
      </t>
      <t>	<!-- 2.1.4 -->
	With or without truncation, the glue present in the additional
	data section should be considered "possibly incomplete",
	and requesters should be prepared to re-query for any damaged
	or missing RRsets.
	Note that truncation of the additional data section might not be
	signaled via the TC bit since additional data is often optional
	(see discussion in Appendix B of <xref target="RFC4472"/>).
      </t>
      <t>	<!-- 2.1.5 -->
	DNS label compression allows the component labels of a domain
	name to be instantiated exactly once per DNS message, and then
	referenced with a two-octet "pointer" from other locations in
	that same DNS message
	(see Section 4.1.4 of <xref target="RFC1035"/>).
	If all nameserver names in a message share a common parent
	(for example, all of them are in "ROOT-SERVERS.NET." zone),
	then more space will be available for incompressible data
	(such as nameserver addresses).
      </t>
      <t>	<!-- 2.1.6 -->
	The query name can be as long as 255 octets of network data.
	In this worst case scenario, the question section will be 259
	octets in size, which would leave only 240 octets for the
	authority and additional sections
	(after deducting 12 octets for the fixed length header)
	in a referral.
      </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Advice to Zone Owners">
      <t>	<!-- 2.2.1 -->
	Average and maximum question section sizes can be predicted by
	the zone owner, since they will know what names actually exist
	and can measure which ones are queried for most often.
	Note that if the zone contains any wildcards, it is possible
	for maximum length queries to require positive responses,
	but that it is reasonable to expect truncation and TCP retry
	in that case.
	For cost and performance reasons, the majority of requests
	should be satisfied without truncation or TCP retry.
      </t>
      <t>	<!-- 2.2.2 -->
	Some queries to non-existing names can be large, but this is not
	a problem because negative responses need not contain any answer,
	authority or additional records.
	See Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC2308"/> for more information about
	the format of negative responses.
      </t>
      <t>	<!-- 2.2.3 -->
	The minimum useful number of name servers is two, for redundancy
	(see Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC1034"/>).
	A zone's name servers should be reachable by all IP protocols
	versions (e.g., IPv4 and IPv6) in common use.
	As long as the servers are well managed, the server serving IPv6
	might be different from the server serving IPv4 sharing the same
	server name.
      </t>
      <t>	<!-- 2.2.4 -->
	The best case is no truncation at all.
	This is because many requesters will retry using TCP immediately,
	or will automatically requery for RRsets that are possibly truncated,
	without considering whether the omitted data was actually necessary.
      </t>
      <t>	<!-- 2.2.5 -->
	Anycasting <xref target="RFC3258"/> is a useful tool for performance
	and reliability without increasing the size of referral responses.
      </t>
      <t>	<!-- 2.2.6 -->
	While it is irrelevant to the response size issue, all zones have
	to be served via IPv4 as well to avoid
	name space fragmentation <xref target="RFC3901"/>.
      </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Advice to Server Implementors">	<!-- 2.3 -->
      <t>	<!-- 2.3.1 -->
	Each NS RR for a zone will add 12 fixed octets
	(name, type, class, ttl, and rdlen) plus 2 to 255 variable octets
	(for the NSDNAME).
	Each A RR will require 16 octets, and each AAAA RR will require 28
	octets.
      </t>
      <t>	<!-- 2.3.2 -->
	While DNS distinguishes between necessary and optional resource
	records, this distinction is according to protocol elements
	necessary to signify facts, and takes no official notice of
	protocol content necessary to ensure correct operation.
	For example, a nameserver name that is in or below the zone cut
	being described by a delegation is "necessary content",
	since there is no way to reach that zone unless the parent zone's
	delegation includes "glue records" describing
	that name server's addresses.
      </t>
      <t>	<!-- 2.3.3 -->
	Recall that the TC bit is only set when a required RRset can
	not be included in its entirety
	(see Section 9 of <xref target="RFC2181"/>).
	Even when some of the RRsets to be included in the additional
	section don't fit in the response size, the TC bit isn't set.
	These RRsets may be important for a referral.
	Some DNS implementations try to resolve these missing glue
	records separately which will introduce extra queries and
	extra time to resolve a given name.
      </t>
      <t>	<!-- 2.3.4 -->
	A delegation response should prioritize glue records as follows.
	<vspace blankLines="1" />
	first:
	<list hangIndent="4" style="empty">
	  <t>
	  All glue RRsets for one name server whose name is in or below the
	  zone being delegated, or which has multiple address RRsets
	  (currently A and AAAA), or preferably both;
	  </t>
	</list>
	second:
	<list hangIndent="4" style="empty">
	  <t>
	  Alternate between adding all glue RRsets for any name servers whose
	  names are in or below the zone being delegated, and all glue RRsets
	  for any name servers who have multiple address RRsets
	  (currently A and AAAA);
	  </t>
	</list>
	thence:
	<list hangIndent="4" style="empty">
	  <t>
	  All other glue RRsets, in any order.
	  </t>
	</list>
	<vspace blankLines="1" />
	Whenever there are multiple candidates for a position in this priority
	scheme, one should be chosen on a round-robin or fully random basis.

	The goal of this priority scheme is to offer "necessary" glue first
	to fill into the response if possible.
<!--	,avoiding silent truncation for this glue if possible. -->
      </t>
      <t>	<!-- 2.3.5 -->
	If any "necessary" content cannot be fit in the response,
	then it is
	advisable that the TC bit be set in order to force a TCP retry,
	rather than have the zone be unreachable.
	Note that a parent server's proper response to a query for
	in-child glue or below-child glue is a referral rather
	than an answer, and that this referral must be able to
	contain the in-child or below-child glue,
	and that in outlying cases, only EDNS or TCP will be large enough
	to contain that data.
      </t>
      <t>
	The glue record order should be independent of the version of
	IP used in the query because the DNS server might just see a query
	from an intermediate server rather than the query from the
	original client.

	Here we use the term "green" if all address records could fit, or

	or "red" if no address record could fit.
	It's clear that without a common parent for nameserver names,

	For these examples we use an average/common name size of 15 octets,

	The current practice of giving all nameserver names a common parent
	(such as "GTLD-SERVERS.NET." or "ROOT-SERVERS.NET.") saves space in DNS
	responses and allows for more nameservers to be enumerated than would
	otherwise be possible, since the common parent domain name only appears
	once in a DNS message and is referred to via "compression pointers"
	thereafter.
      </t>
      <t>
	If all nameserver names for a zone share a common parent,
	then it is operationally advisable to make all servers for
	the zone thus served also be authoritative for the zone of
	that common parent.
	For example, the root name servers (?.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.) can answer
	authoritatively for the ROOT-SERVERS.NET. zone.
	This is to ensure that the zone's servers always have the zone's
	nameservers' glue available when delegating, and will be able
	to respond with answers rather than referrals if a requester
	who wants that glue comes back asking for it.
	In this case the name server will likely be a
	"stealth server" -- authoritative but unadvertised in the glue
	zone's NS RRset.
	See Section 2 of <xref target="RFC1996"/> for more
	information about stealth servers.
      </t>
      <t>
	Thirteen (13) is the effective maximum number of nameserver names
	usable with traditional (non-extended) DNS,
	assuming a common parent domain name, and given that implicit
	referral response truncation is undesirable in the average case.
      </t>
      <t>
	More than one address record in a protocol family per server is
	inadvisable since the necessary glue RRsets (A or AAAA) are
	atomically indivisible, and will be larger than a single
	resource record.
	Larger RRsets are more likely to lead to or encounter truncation.
      </t>
      <t>
	More than one address record across protocol families is less
	likely to lead to or encounter truncation, partly because
	multiprotocol clients, which are required to handle larger
	RRsets such as AAAA RRs, are more likely to speak EDNS,
	which can use a larger UDP response size limit,
	and partly because the resource records (A and AAAA) are in
	different RRsets and are therefore divisible from each other.
      </t>
      <t>
	Name server names that are at or below the zone they serve are
	more sensitive to referral response truncation,
	and glue records for them should be considered "more important"
	than other glue records, in the assembly of referral responses.
      </t>
<!--
      <t>
	If a zone is served by thirteen (13) name servers having a common
	parent name (such as ?.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.) and each such name server
	has a single address record in some protocol family
	(e.g., an A RR), then all thirteen name servers or any subset
	thereof could have address records in a second protocol family
	by adding a second address record (e.g., an AAAA RR)
	without reducing the reachability of the zone thus served.
