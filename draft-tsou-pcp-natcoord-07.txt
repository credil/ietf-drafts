1.  Application Scenario

   PCP can be used to control an upstream device to achieve the
   following goals:

   1.  A plain (i.e., a non-shared) IP address can be assigned to a
       given subscriber because the subscriber subscribed to a service
       which uses a protocol that don't embed a transport number or
       because the NAT is the only deployed platform to manage IP
       addresses.

   2.  An application (e.g., sensor) does not need to listen to a whole
       range of ports available on a given IP address.  Only a limited
       set of ports are used to bind its running services.  For such
       devices, the external port(s) and IP address can be delegated to
       that application and therefore avoid enforcing NAT in the network
       side for its associated flows.  The NAT in the PCP- controlled
       device should be bypassed.

   3.  A device able to restrict its source ports can be delegated an
       external port restricted IP address.  The PCP- controlled device
       should be instructed to by-pass the NAT when handling flows
       destined/issued to that device.

   This document extends PCP with the ability to reserve port set
   instead of individual mapping.  This is motivated by the need to
   offload to a port-restricted device in lightweight 4over6
   [I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite], reduce the logging and
   enhance the performance of the CGN.

   A new PCP OpCode and two new PCP Options are defined in this
   document.


2.  MAP_PORT_SET Opcode

   This section defines a new Opcode which requests port set from a PCP-
   controlled device to a PCP client.  By analogy, a port set binding
   can be seen as an aggregate of MAP mappings.  When assigning a port
   set to a PCP Client, the PCP-controlled device maintains a binding
   between the source IP address of the PCP request, the assigned
   external IP address and port set.  It can greatly reduce individual
   MAP requests for a PCP client when requesting a bulk of ports at one
   time.  This mechanism can be applied for lightweight 4over6
   [I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite] in port-set allocation
   process.

   MAP_PORT_SET: Create an explicit dynamic mapping between an

   Internel's IP Address and an External Address + Port set

   The format of a port-set can either be contiguous or non-contiguous
   including a cryptographical assigned port set.  The contiguous port-
   set is simple but since the port space for a subscriber shrinks
   significantly, the randomness for the port numbers is decreased
   significantly.  This may allow an attacker to guess the port number
   used.  Non-contiguous port-set, e.g., cryptographical algorithm
   [RFC6431], can be provided to improve the randomness of port number.
   It may be used as a mitigation tool against blind attacks.
   Therefore, in MAP_PORT_SET Opcode, it is mandatory to support two
   port-set options: PORT_MASK Option and
   Cryptographically_Random_Port_set Option.  Besides, PREFERE_FAILURE
   Option would also apply for MAP_PORT_SET Opcode.

   PCP-controlled device SHOULD provide a configuration option to allow
   administrators to configure the size of the port set to be assigned
   and whether cryptographical option is supported or not.

2.1.  MAP_PORT_SET Operation Packet Formats

   The MAP_PORT_SET Opcode has a similar packet layout for both requests
   and response.  The following figure shows the format of the Opcode in
   a request for the MAP_PORT_SET Opcode.

      whole port-set mapping, in seconds.  The value 0 also indicates
      "delete" here.

   Discussion note: Assess further whether THIRD_PARTY Option is needed
   for PORTRANGE OpCode.

2.2.  Port-Set Options Formats

   The Port_Set options are used to specify one set of ports pertaining
   to a given IP address.  As defined in [RFC6431],there are three kinds
   of port range: contiguous, non-contiguous and random.  A
   cryptographically random Port Range Option may be used as a
   mitigation tool against blind attacks.  We will describe the two port
   set PCP options in this section.

2.2.1.  Port_Range_Option

      0                   1                   2                   3

                        Figure 3: Port_Range_Option

   o  Port Range Value (PRV): The PRV indicates the value of the
      significant bits of the Port Mask.  By default, no PRM value is
      assigned.  It can also convey Suggested Port Range Value if the
      client has a hint on it.  In MAP_PORT_SET response, it is an
      Assigned Port Range Value.

   o  Port Range Mask (PRM): The Port Range Mask indicates the position
      of the bits that are used to build the Port Range Value.  By
      default, no PRM value is assigned.  The 1 values in the Port Range
      Mask indicate by their position the significant bits of the Port
      Range Value.  It can also convey Suggested Port Range Mask if the
      client has a hint on it.  In MAP_PORT_SET response, it is an
      Assigned Port Range Mask.

   This option:

   o  name: Port range option

   o  number: TBA

   o  purpose: A PCP Client inserts this option in a PCP request to
      specify one set of ports (contiguous or not contiguous) pertaining
      to a given IP address.

      as input a key 'K' and an integer 'x' within the 1024-65535 port
      range and produces an output 'y' also within the 1024-65535 port
      range.

   o  is valid for OpCodes:MAP_PORT_SET.

   o  length: 24 octets.

   o  may appear in:request and response

   o  maximum occurrences:1

2.3.  Generating a MAP_PORT_SET Request

   The request MAP_PORT_SET MUST contains one of the port-set options,
   either PORT_RANGE option or Cryptographically_Random_Port_Set option.
   The request MAY contain values in the Suggested IP Address field and
   corresponding parameters in PORT_RANGE option.  However, this port
   set indicated in the request of the PCP Client is only a hint; it is
   up to the PCP Server to assign a free port set.

   If a client fails to receive an expected response from a server, the
   client must retransmit its message.  The client begins the message
   exchange by transmitting a message to the server.  The PORT_SET_Nonce
   should be copied from the previous MAP_PORT_SET request.

2.4.  Renewing a MAP_PORT_SET Mapping

   The similar actions defined in PCP-BASE specification [section 10.2.1
   of [ID.ietf-pcp-base]] can be applied to MAP_PORT_SET Opcode to
   extend the lifetime of a port-set mapping.  The MAP_PORT_SET renewal
   can be regarded as a new PCP request with a different PORT_SET_Nonce.
   The MAP_PORT_SET request MUST include the currently assigned IP
   address and port-set in the suggested IP address and port-set
   options.  The PCP-client should renew the port-set mapping before its
   expiry time.

   The PCP client SHOULD renew the mapping before its expiry time,
   otherwise the port-set binding record will be removed by the PCP
   server.

2.5.  Processing a MAP_PORT_SET Request

   The procedures regarding to lifetime is similar to the single port
   processes in MAP Opcode [section 10.3 of [ID.ietf-pcp-base]], except
   that the whole port-set should be treated consistently in
   MAP_PORT_SET Opcode.

Internet-Draft   NAT Coordination Using Port Allocation        July 2012


   It is totally up to the server to determine the port-set quota for
   each subscriber.  A PCP server SHOULD maintain MAX_USER_QUOTA and
   MAX_REQUEST_QUOTA.  MAX_USER_QUOTA is to indicate the maximum number
   of ports a subscriber may get in total, and MAX_REQUEST_QUOTA is to
   indicate the maximum number of ports in each request.  The specific
   mechanism to configure the quotas is out of scope.

   The error codes in MAP_PORT_SET Response mainly have the following
   possibilities:

   o  If the PCP server or PCP-controlled device does not support
      MAP_PORT_SET Opcode, the error UNSUPP_OPCODE MUST be returned.

   o  if the PCP server or PCP-controlled device does not support the
      port-set option indicated in MAP_PORT_SET request, the error
      UNSUPP_OPTION MUST be returned.

   o  If an option does not make sense, (e.g., the PREFER_FAILURE Option
      is included in a request with lifetime=0, or MAP_PORT_SET Opcode
      does not include port-set options, etc.,), the request is invalid
      and generates a MALFORMED_OPTION error.  This procedure is the
      same with section 10.3 of [ID.ietf-pcp-base].

   If the requested lifetime is zero, it indicates a request to delete
   an existing mapping.

   The PCP server needs to remember N PORT_SET_Nonces, in which N SHOULD
   not be larger than floor(MAX_USER_QUOTA/MAX_REQUEST_QUOTA).  In order
   to simplify the implementation, it is recommended that N is equal to
   ONE so that only one MAP_PORT_SET assignment request is permitted for
   each subscriber.  This policy SHOULD be configurable.

   It is possible that a mapping might already exist for a requested
   Internal address (derived from client's IP address).  If so, the PCP
   server MUST take the following actions:

      If the suggested External address and port-set in request packet
      matches the mapping record (including the Internal address,
      assigned External address, and the port-set), and the existing
      mapping is dynamic (created by a previous MAP_PORT_SET), the PCP
      server MUST update the lifetime of the existing mapping and return
      the existing External Address and Port in response.

      If the suggested External address and port-set in request packet
      does not match the mapping record for the client, the PCP server
      SHOULD check whether the PORT_SET_Nonce in the request has a
      corresponding mapping.  If so, it means that this mapping record
      is created by previous MAP_PORT_SET and request/response might be

      discarded for some reason in transimission.  Then the PCP server
      MUST return the existing External Address and Port in its
      response, regardless of the Suggested External Address and Port in
      the request.  The lifetime of the existing dynamic mapping MUST be
      updated.

      If there is no mapping record in PCP server for the particular
      PORT_SET_Nonce of MAP_PORT_SET request, it means that the client
      requires for another delegated set of ports using a new
      MAP_PORT_SET request.  In this case, the PCP server SHOULD check
      whether the amount of current allocated ports for the client is
      less than the MAX_USER_QUOTA, and SHOULD assign a new mapping if
      it does not reach the MAX-USER_QUOTAS and there is no
      PREFER_FAILURE Option in packet.  It is highly suggested that the
      same external IP address should be assigned for the same
      subscriber.

   If no mapping exists for the requested Internal address (derived from
   client's IP address), and the PCP server is able to create a mapping
   using the suggested External Address and Port-set, it Should do so.
   This is beneficial for re-establishing state lost in the PCP server.
   If the PCP server cannot assgin the Suggested External Address and
   Port-set but can assign some other External Address and Port-set (and
   the request did not contain the PREER_FAILURE Option) the PCP server
   MUST do so and return newly assigned External Address and Port-set in
   response.

   If the MAP request contains the PREFER_FAILURE Option, but the
   Suggested External Address and Port is not available, the PCP server
   MUST return CANNOT_PROVIDE_EXTERNAL.

   If the PCP server supports both MAP and MAP_PORT_SET Opcode, the
   server SHOULD check whether the assigned external address is exactly
   the same with the one for MAP_PORT_SET , and the external port for
   MAP is within the range of the port-set for MAP_PORT_SET.  Otherwise,
   the PCP server MUST return NO_RESOURCES.

   [Discussion: Should we support MAP_PORT_SET and MAP co-existence
   scenario?  Normally, the PCP server for MAP_PORT_SET will not run
   NAT.  And so, there is no NAT binding in PCP. ]

   [Discussion note: Do we need to cover the case in which a client MAY
   send a request to the LSN for another delegated set of ports?]

   If all of the preceding operations were successful (did not generate
   an error response), then the requested port-set mapping is created or
   refreshed as described in the request and a SUCCESS response is
   built.  The assigned external IPv4 (encoded using IPv4-mapped IPv6

   address) or IPv6 address for the mapping should be returned.

2.6.  Processing a MAP_PORT_SET Response

   On receiving a MAP_PORT_SET Response, the same procedure as the one
   for individual mapping [section 10.4 of [ID.ietf-pcp-base]] should be
   followed by the PCP Client to validate the response (except the
   considerations related to the internal port).

2.7.  Mapping Lifetime and Deletion

   The procedure for port-set mapping lifetime and deletion is also the
   same with individual mapping [section 10.5 of [ID.ietf-pcp-base]].

2.8.  PREFER_FAILURE Option for MAP_PORT_SET Opcode

   This option [section 10.2 of [ID.ietf-pcp-base]] can be applied to
   MAP_PORT_SET Opcode indicating that if the PCP server cannot map the
   suggested External Address and port-set, the PCP server should not
   create a mapping.
