Internet-Draft  IPv6 Site Renumbering Operational Guidelines  June 2013



1. Introduction

   For IPv6 renumbering, there have been several works addressing on it.
   [RFC4192] describes a procedure that can be used to renumber a
   network from one prefix to another smoothly through a "make-before-
   break" transition. [RFC5887] makes a comprehensive analysis and
   pointed out there are still some work to do in the future. Making
   [RFC5887] as a starting point, [RFC6879] illustrates IPv6 enterprise
   renumbering scenarios and gives some considerations to ease
   renumbering while [I.D-ietf-6renum-gap-analysis](to be a RFC soon)
   identifies gaps in the scenarios.

   In general, this draft considers the make-before-break approach in
   [RFC4192] as a basic method of IPv6 enterprise renumbering. Since
   [RFC4192] already includes some basic operational approaches, this
   document focusing on operational guidelines which reflex the new
   learning from [RFC5887], [RFC6879], and [I.D-ietf-6renum-gap-
   analysis].

   This document considers a renumbering event as several basic
   operational stages which are numbering, adding a new prefix, and
   deprecating old prefix(es). Guidelines are given according to each
   stage. Besides the general operations, this document also gives some
   considerations on specific operations including ND/DHCPv6
   collaboration, DHCPv6 reconfiguration, secure dynamic DNS update and
   multicast.

2. Numbering Operations

   Operations in numbering stage is important for future renumbering,
   since it might impact the renumbering operations/mechanisms selection
   or even causes some troubles if not operated properly. Generally,
   this section complies the considerations in [RFC6879] section 4.1
   (considerations and current methods during network design). Some
   topics are briefly re-generated from [RFC6879] or other documents to
   make this section as stand-alone complete guidelines.

2.1. Using FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Names)

   If a node using FQDN, when renumbering, the address only need to be
   updated once in the node and in the correspond DNS record(s), then
   every places using the FQDN could learn the new address through DNS
   queries. This is a significant benefit for easing renumbering and is
   usually very suitable for servers, tunnels etc. However, this good
   feature seems not been widely used in real network deployment.



Bing Liu              Expires December 31, 2013               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Site Renumbering Operational Guidelines  June 2013


   Since FQDN relies on DNS, the administrators need to know it has all
   the limitations of DNS systems.

2.2. Using ULAs (Unique Local Addresses)

   For some internal-only nodes, it is practical to number them with
   ULAs, then renumbering events caused by external factors (ISP change,
   ISP renumbering .etc) could be avoided.

   ULAs could also co-exist with PA (Provider Aggregated) GUAs (Global
   Unicast Addresses). The benefit is to ensure stable and specific
   local communications regardless of any ISP failure.

   It should be noticed that, if ULAs are co-exist with PA addresses,
   the administrators need to carefully handle the address selection
   policies in the nodes to make sure a ULA-ULA address pair, since a
   ULA-PA address pair might cause connection failure. This issue could
   be silently solved in the future, since the revised address selection
   algorithm standard (RFC6724) has enable ULA-ULA pair selection as
   default.

   Another operational concern is to make sure the ULA correspond DNS
   records should not be propagated outside the local recruit DNS
   servers.

2.3. Leveraging the loopback interface

   Some current routers support defining multiple loopback interfaces
   that can be called in other configurations. For example, when
   defining a tunnel, it can call the defined loopback interface to use
   its address as the local address of the tunnel.

   This feature makes renumbering easier by reducing the number of
   places where a device's address configuration must be updated.

2.4. Router numbering

   [RFC2894] defined standard ICMPv6 messages for router
   numbering/renumbering. This is a dedicated protocol, but we are not
   aware of it being used in real network deployment. So in real
   networks, routers are basically numbered though human intervene.

   For routers, an OAM (Operations Administration and Management) plane
   is usually needed. The administrators could also leverage ULAs to
   number the router loopback interfaces so that the OAM plane is
   logically separated from the data forwarding plane so that the OAM
   connectivity could be immune of the data plane impact.

2.5. Static addresses

   As analyzed in [RFC6866], Static address configurations might not be
   avoided in some situations, for example, the address-based software
   licensing.

   However, the administrators should note that "static" doesn't
   necessarily mean "manual". Manual configurations should be avoided as
   much as possible since it would be highly burdensome and error prone
   to type/remeber the IPv6 addresses. Administrators should leverage
   tools to configure/manage the static addresses.

3. Adding a new prefix

   o Add a prefix to the network infrastructure

   The operations of adding a new prefix in a network infrastructure has
   been well addressed in section 2.3 and 2.4 in [RFC4192]. To briefly
   summarize it, there are several main procedures as the following:

   - The new prefix is added to the routing infrastructure, firewall
   filters, ingress/egress filters, and other forwarding and filtering
   functions

   - Routes for the new link prefixes may be injected by routing
   protocols into the routing subsystem

   - The RA (Router Advertisement) messages should not cause hosts to
   perform SLAAC on the new link prefixes since the new prefix might has
   not been stable

   - Once the new prefix in network infrastructure is in place and
   tested, then assign the new addresses to the hosts

   - The new addresses will not be used until they are inserted into the
   DNS

   o A temporary multihoming environment

   Add a new prefix usually meaning add a new ISP uplink. So when the
   new prefix has been added into the network, then it became a
   temporary multihoming environment with multiple PA prefixes.

   If the ISPs enable ingress filtering at the edge, then the
   administrators need to deal with the source address selection and the
   exit router selection issues. For the latter, currently there is no

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Site Renumbering Operational Guidelines  June 2013


   well-used solution, so the administrator might need to communicate
   with the ISP for not filtering the prefixes.

   o Making the new prefix higher priority

   When the new prefix is stable, the new sessions should always choose
   the new address as the source address. This consideration is to avoid
   the new sessions might be long enough to exceed the old/new address
   overlap period so that the session survivability would be broken. The
   probability is especially high at the end of overlap period.

   To achieve this effort, the administrators could advertise the old
   prefix as deprecated through RA messages for the SLAAC hosts; for
   DHCPv6 hosts, the administrators need to deal with the address
   selection policy tables in the hosts.

4. Deprecating old prefix(es)

4.1. Deprecating SLAAC prefix

   For the SLAAC-configured hosts, the prefix deprecation operation
   could be done through standard RA messages. First, the administrators
   could make the router to deprecate the prefix, and at the end of the
   overlap period, the administrators could advertise the prefix with
   very short lifetime so that the old prefix would be invalid soon.

4.2. Deprecating DHCPv6 old addresses

   For DHCPv6-configured hosts, the T1 time has to be short enough that
   the addresses could expire before they are deprecated. Then the hosts
   could get the new addresses through renew hebaviour.

5. ND/DHCPv6 Collaboration

5.1. Host Numbering

   IPv6 has overlapped functions between ND and DHCPv6, they fit in
   different scenarios. [I-D.liu-bonica-dhcpv6-slaac-problem] identified
   some operational problems of the protocol interactions, so the
   administrators need careful plan and cooperation of these two
   mechanisms.

5.1.1. Address Provisioning

   There could be three kind of possible address provisioning models,
   which are discussed as the following.



Bing Liu              Expires December 31, 2013               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Site Renumbering Operational Guidelines  June 2013


   o SLAAC-only prefix provisioning

   It's efficient to run DHCP-PD between routers and DHCPv6 server, and
   SLACC on the downlinks. This combination could leverage the
   numbering/renumbering operations the maxim automation.

   o DHCPv6-only address provisioning

   If administrators want a DHCPv6-only managed network, then it is
   recommended to turn SLAAC off through A=0 (the Autonomous flag) and
   keep RA working with M flag set (the Managed flag). Because as
   identified in [I-D.liu-bonica-dhcpv6-slaac-problem], some operation
   systems would not initiate DHCPv6 session until they received the M
   flag set in RA messages.

   o SLAAC/DHCPv6 co-existence prefix/address provisioning

   In normal cases, it is recommended to use only one address
   provisioning model for a host. But there might be some special
   situations in which both the two models are needed simultaneously.
   For example, the network need to be multihomed, and one uplink uses
   DHCPv6 for management while the other uses SLAAC. Then the SLAAC link
   need always keeping the M flag set to make sure all the host would
   initiate DHCPv6 sessions beside the SLAAC configuration.

5.1.2. Information Provisioning

     - Currently only ND could provide routing information to hosts, RA
       should be always on

     - Using stateful DHCPv6 for info provisioning as well as addresses

     - Using stateless DHCPv6 for info provisioning and SLAAC for
       address provisioning

     - Using ND for both address and info (currently only support
       routing and DNS)

5.2. Adding a new prefix

     - The new prefix might use different address provisioning

     - For already DHCPv6-configured hosts, it is not applicable to add
       another DHCPv6 session parall, DHCPv6's architecture is not well
       supporting multiple provisioning domains yet, the administrators
       need to avoid this kind of use cases.

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Site Renumbering Operational Guidelines  June 2013


     - For already SLAAC-configured hosts, they might ignore the M
       transitioning from 0 to 1, so still using SLAAC for adding a new
       prefix is better than adding a DHCPv6 address provisioning

5.3. Deprecating a prefix

   TBD.

6. DHCPv6 reconfiguration

   DHCPv6 reconfiguration is a standard function defined in [RFC3315].
   This function is quite practical for bulk renumbering triggered by
   the servers. It is very suitable for DHCPv6-only managed networks.

   There is no significant additional burden to maintaining the state
   required to send Reconfigures to every client. A power outage restart
   scenario takes similar burden for the DHCP systems comparing to bulk
   reconfiguration. As the authors learned, mainstream commercial DHCP
   servers that could handle a typical enterprise power outage restart.

   If the administrators want the reconfiguration be effective, they
   need to group the DHCP clients based on prefix in the server, so that
   the reconfiguration could be triggered by prefix change.

   However, the reconfiguration has not been widely used since it has
   not been widely supported yet, but as the author investigated, it is
   already on some DHCP implementations' feature list in the near future.
   So it is foreseeable that DHCPv6 reconfiguration could be a effective
   tool for renumbering.

7. Secure Dynamic DNS Update

   Using dynamic DNS update could significantly improve the efficiency
   and automation of renumbering. DDNS has vital security threats, so in
   real deployment, Secure Dynamic DNS Update [RFC3007] is always needed
   and already has been widely supported by the major DNS
   implementations.

   However, normal hosts are not suitable to do the update mainly
   because of the complexity of key management issues inherited from
   secure DNS mechanisms, so current practices usually assign the DHCP
   servers to act as DNS clients to request the DNS server updating
   relevant records [RFC4704]. The key management problem is tractable
   in the case of updates for a limited number of servers, so Dynamic
   DNS updates could serve as a suitable solution for keeping server DNS
   records up to date on a typical enterprise network.  However, this
   solution is not easily applicable to hosts in general.

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Site Renumbering Operational Guidelines  June 2013


   To address the larger use case of arbitrary non-server hosts being
   renumbered, DHCP servers have to learn the relevant hosts have
   changed their addresses and thus trigger the DDNS update. If the
   hosts were numbered and also renumbered by DHCP, then it is easy for
   the DHCP servers to learn the address changes; but if the hosts were
   numbered by SLAAC, then there could be trouble.

   The key distribution could be much easier on DHCP servers, but then
   stronger security protection between hosts and DHCP servers is needed.
   Generally, this could be considered as an operational issue. One
   possible way is to put all the regular hosts in their own zone, e.g.
   ddns.sample.com. So when a host registers with DHCP, it gets a PTR
   record for its IP address, and an A record with its name. For an
   instance, there is one node whose name is EXAPLE, so it is registered
   automatically by the DHCP server as EXAPLE.ddns.sample.com.

   Additionally, DHCP clients can't overwrite existing non-DHCP names in
   the DNS, because DHCP servers follow RFC 4703, which prevents this.
   So even if the network doesn't use a separate zone, a DHCP server
   won't honor a client's update if it presents a un-matching name (e.g.
   "www" name).

8. Other Operational Considerations

   TBD (if there would be).

9. Security Considerations

   TBD.

10. IANA Considerations

   This draft does not request any IANA actions.
