    <abstract>
      <t>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
      quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain.
      The overall rate of the PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the PCN
      domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain configured
      rates are exceeded. Egress nodes pass information about these PCN-marks
      to decision points which then decide whether to admit or block new flow
      requests or to terminate some already-admitted flows during serious
      pre-congestion.</t>

      <t>This document specifies how PCN-marks are to be encoded into the IP
      header by re-using the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) codepoints
      within a PCN-domain. The PCN wire protocol for non-IP protocol headers
      will need to be defined elsewhere. Nonetheless, this document clarifies
      the PCN encoding for MPLS in an informational Appendix. The encoding for
      IP provides for up to three different PCN marking states using a single
      DSCP: Not-marked (NM), Threshold-marked (ThM) and Excess-traffic-marked
      (ETM). Hence, it is called the 3-in-1 PCN encoding. This document
      obsoletes RFC5696.</t>

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) <xref
      target="RFC5559"></xref> is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of
      inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain, in a simple, scalable, and
      robust fashion. Two mechanisms are used: admission control, to decide
      whether to admit or block a new flow request, and flow termination to
      terminate some existing flows during serious pre-congestion. To achieve
      this, the overall rate of PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the
      domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain configured
      rates are exceeded. These configured rates are below the rate of the
      link thus providing notification to boundary nodes about overloads
      before any real congestion occurs (hence "pre-congestion
      notification").</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5670"></xref> provides for two metering and marking
      functions that are generally configured with different reference rates.
      Threshold-marking marks all PCN packets once their traffic rate on a
      link exceeds the configured reference rate (PCN-threshold-rate).
      Excess-traffic-marking marks only those PCN packets that exceed the
      configured reference rate (PCN-excess-rate). The PCN-excess-rate is
      typically larger than the PCN-threshold-rate <xref
      target="RFC5559"></xref>. Egress nodes monitor the PCN-marks of received
      PCN-packets and pass information about these PCN-marks to decision
      points which then decide whether to admit new flows or terminate
      existing flows <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour"></xref>,
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-sm-edge-behaviour"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The encoding defined in <xref target="RFC5696"></xref> described how
      two PCN marking states (Not-marked and PCN-Marked) could be encoded into
      the IP header using a single Diffserv codepoint. It defined 01 as an
      experimental codepoint (EXP), along with guidelines for its use. Two PCN
      marking states are sufficient for the Single Marking edge behaviour
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-sm-edge-behaviour"></xref>. However,
      PCN-domains utilising the controlled load edge behaviour <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour"></xref> require three PCN
      marking states. This document extends the RFC5696 encoding by redefining
      the experimental codepoint as a third PCN marking state in the IP
      header, but still using a single Diffserv codepoint. This encoding
      scheme is therefore called the "3-in-1 PCN encoding". It obsoletes the
      <xref target="RFC5696"></xref> encoding, which provides only a sub-set
      of the same capabilities.</t>

      <t>The full version of the 3-in-1 encoding requires any tunnel endpoint
      within the PCN-domain to support the normal tunnelling rules defined in
      <xref target="RFC6040"></xref>. There is one limited exception to this
      constraint where the PCN-domain only uses the excess-traffic-marking
      behaviour and where the threshold-marking behaviour is deactivated. This
      is discussed in <xref target="pcn3in1_interior_ETM_only"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document only concerns the PCN wire protocol encoding for IP
      headers, whether IPv4 or IPv6. It makes no changes or recommendations
      concerning algorithms for congestion marking or congestion response.
      Other documents will define the PCN wire protocol for other header
      types. <xref target="pcn3in1_app_map_IP_MPLS"></xref> discusses a
      possible mapping between IP and MPLS.</t>

      <t>A PCN-node will be configured to recognise certain DSCPs as
      PCN-compatible. <xref target="pcn3in1_app_DSCP_choice"></xref> discusses
      the choice of suitable DSCPs. In <xref
      target="pcn3in1_Fig_Encoding"></xref> 'DSCP n' indicates such a
      PCN-compatible DSCP. In the PCN-domain, any packet carrying a
      PCN-compatible DSCP and with the ECN-field anything other than 00
      (Not-PCN) is a PCN-packet as defined in <xref
      target="RFC5559"></xref>.</t>

      <t>PCN-nodes MUST interpret the ECN field of a PCN-packet using the
      3-in-1 PCN encoding, rather than <xref target="RFC3168"></xref>. This
      does not change the behaviour for any packet with a DSCP that is not
      PCN-compatible, or for any node outside a PCN-domain. In all such cases
      the 3-in-1 encoding is not applicable and so by default the node will
      interpret the ECN field using <xref target="RFC3168"></xref>.</t>

      <t>When using the 3-in-1 encoding, the codepoints of the ECN field have
      the following meanings:<list style="hanging">

      <section anchor="pcn3in1_Requirement" title="PCN Requirements">
        <t>In accordance with the PCN architecture <xref
        target="RFC5559"></xref>, PCN-ingress-nodes control packets entering a
        PCN-domain. Packets belonging to PCN-controlled flows are subject to
        PCN-metering and -marking, and PCN-ingress-nodes mark them as
        Not-marked (PCN-colouring). All nodes in the PCN-domain perform
        PCN-metering and PCN-mark PCN-packets if needed. There are two
        different metering and marking behaviours: threshold-marking and
        excess-traffic-marking <xref target="RFC5670"></xref>. Some edge
        behaviours require only a single marking behaviour <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pcn-sm-edge-behaviour"></xref>, others require both
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour"></xref>. In the latter
        case, three PCN marking states are needed: Not-marked (NM) to indicate
        not-marked packets, Threshold-marked (ThM) to indicate packets marked
        by the threshold-marker, and Excess-traffic-marked (ETM) to indicate
        packets marked by the excess-traffic-marker <xref
        target="RFC5670"></xref>. Threshold-marking and excess-traffic-marking
        are configured to start marking packets at different load conditions,
        so one marking behaviour indicates more severe pre-congestion than the
        other. Therefore, a fourth PCN marking state indicating that a packet
        is marked by both markers is not needed. However a fourth codepoint is
        required to indicate packets that use a PCN-compatible DSCP but do not
        use PCN-marking (the Not-PCN codepoint).</t>

        <t>In all current PCN edge behaviours that use two marking behaviours
        <xref target="RFC5559"></xref>, <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour"></xref>,
        excess-traffic-marking is configured with a larger reference rate than
        threshold-marking. We take this as a rule and define
        excess-traffic-marked as a more severe PCN-mark than
        Threshold-marked.</t>

      <section anchor="pcn3in1_Requirements_Tunnelling"
               title="Requirements Imposed by Tunnelling">
        <t><xref target="RFC6040"></xref> defines rules for the encapsulation
        and decapsulation of ECN markings within IP-in-IP tunnels. The
        publication of RFC6040 removed the tunnelling constraints that existed
        when the encoding of <xref target="RFC5696"></xref> was written (see
        section 3.3.2 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pcn-encoding-comparison"></xref>).</t>

        <t>Nonetheless, there is still a problem if there are any legacy
        (pre-RFC6040) decapsulating tunnel endpoints within a PCN domain. If a
        PCN-node Threshold-marks the outer header of a tunnelled packet that
        has a Not-marked codepoint on the inner header, a legacy decapsulator
        will forward the packet as Not-marked, losing the Threshold-marking.
        The rules on applicability in <xref
        target="pcn3in1_Requirements_Applicability"></xref> below are designed
        to avoid this problem.</t>

        <t>Even if an operator accidentally breaks these applicability rules,
        the order of severity of the 3-in-1 codepoints was chosen to protect
        other PCN or non-PCN traffic. Although legacy pre-RFC6040 tunnels did
        not propagate '01', all tunnels pre-RFC6040 and post-RFC6040 have
        always propagated '11' correctly. Therefore '11' was chosen to signal
        the most severe pre-congestion (ETM), so it would act as a reliable
        fail-safe even if an overlooked legacy tunnel was suppressing 01 (ThM)
        signals.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="pcn3in1_Requirements_Applicability"
               title="Applicable Environments for the 3-in-1 PCN Encoding">
        <t>The 3-in-1 encoding is applicable in situations where two marking
        behaviours are being used in the PCN-domain. The 3-in-1 encoding can
        also be used with only one marking behaviour, in which case one of the
        codepoints MUST NOT be used anywhere in the PCN-domain (see <xref
        target="pcn3in1_interior_one_mark_behaviour"></xref>).</t>

        <t>With one exception (see next paragraph), any tunnel endpoints
        (IP-in-IP and IPsec) within the PCN-domain MUST comply with the ECN
        encapsulation and decapsulation rules set out in <xref
        target="RFC6040"></xref> (see <xref
        target="pcn3in1_Requirements_Tunnelling"></xref>).</t>

        <t>Operators may not be able to upgrade every pre-RFC6040 tunnel
        endpoint within a PCN-domain. In such circumstances a limited version
        of the 3-in-1 encoding can still be used but only under the following
        stringent condition. If any pre-RFC6040 tunnel decapsulator exists
        within a PCN-domain then every PCN-node in the PCN-domain MUST be
        configured so that it never sets the ThM codepoint. PCN-interior-nodes
        in this case MUST solely use the Excess-traffic-marking function, as
        defined in <xref target="pcn3in1_interior_ETM_only"></xref>. In all
        other situations where legacy tunnel decapsulators might be present
        within the PCN domain, the 3-in-1 encoding is not applicable.</t>

        <t>Each ingress link into a PCN domain will apply the four functions
        described in section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC5559"></xref> to arriving
        packets. These functions are applied in the following order: classify,
        police, PCN-colour, meter. This section describes these four steps,
        but only the aspects relevant to packet encoding:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="1. Packet classification:">The PCN-ingress-node
            determines whether each packet matches the filter spec of an
            admitted flow. Packets that match are defined as PCN-packets.</t>

            <t hangText="1b. Extra step if ECN and PCN co-exist:">If a packet
            classified as a PCN-packet arrives with the ECN field already set
            to a value other than Not-ECT (i.e. it is from an ECN-capable
            transport) then to comply with BCP 124 <xref
            target="RFC4774"></xref> it MUST pass through one of the following
            preparatory steps before the PCN-policing and PCN-colouring steps.
            The choice between these four actions depends on local
            policy:<list style="symbols">
                <t>Tunnel ECN-capable PCN-packets across the PCN-domain, using
                an RFC6040 tunnel. This tunnelling step MUST precede
                PCN-policing and PCN-colouring so that the tunnel is logically
                outside the PCN domain (see <xref
                target="pcn3in1_app_ecn_coexist"></xref> and specifically
                <xref target="pcn3in1_Fig_Tunnel"></xref>).<vspace
                blankLines="1" />This tunnelling policy is the RECOMMENDED
                choice, and implementations SHOULD use it as the default.</t>

                <t>If tunnelling is not possible, the PCN-ingress-node can
                allow through ECN-capable packets without tunnelling, but it
                MUST drop CE-marked packets at this stage. Failure to drop CE
                would risk congestion collapse, because without a tunnel there
                is no mechanism to propagate the CE markings across the
                PCN-domain (see <xref
                target="pcn3in1_app_ecn_coexist"></xref>).<vspace
                blankLines="1" />This policy is NOT RECOMMENDED because there
                is no tunnel to protect the e2e ECN capability, which is
                otherwise disabled when the PCN-egress-node zeroes the ECN
                field.</t>

                <t>Drop the packet.<vspace blankLines="1" />This policy is
                also NOT RECOMMENDED, because it precludes the possibility
                that e2e ECN can co-exist with PCN as a means of controlling
                congestion.</t>

                <t>Any other action that complies with <xref
                target="RFC4774"></xref> (see <xref
                target="pcn3in1_app_ecn_coexist"></xref> for an example).</t>

            more information about the co-existence of PCN and ECN.</t>

            <t hangText="2. PCN-Policing:">The PCN-policing function only
            allows appropriate packets into the PCN behaviour aggregate.
            Per-flow policing actions may be required, but these are specified
            in the relevant edge-behaviour document, e.g. <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-pcn-sm-edge-behaviour"></xref>, <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour"></xref>. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />Here we only specify packet-level PCN-policing,
            which prevents packets that are not PCN-packets from being
            forwarded into the PCN-domain if PCN-interior-nodes would
            otherwise mistake them for PCN-packets. A non-PCN-packet will be
            confused with a PCN-packet if on arrival it meets all three of the
            following conditions: <list style="format %c)">
                <t>it is not classified as a PCN-packet</t>

                <t>it already carries a PCN-compatible DSCP</t>

                <t>its ECN field carries a codepoint other than Not-ECT.</t>
              </list>The PCN-ingress-node MUST police packets that meet all
            three conditions (a-c) by subjecting them to one of the following
            treatments:<list style="symbols">
                <t>re-mark the DSCP to a DSCP that is not PCN-compatible;</t>

                <t>tunnel the packet to the PCN-egress with a DSCP in the
                outer header that is not PCN-compatible;</t>

                <t>drop the packet (NOT RECOMMENDED&mdash;see below).</t>
              </list>The choice between these actions depends on local policy.
            In the absence of any operator-specific configuration for this
            case, by default an implementation SHOULD re-mark the DSCP to
            zero.<vspace blankLines="1" />Traffic that meets all three of the
            above conditions (a-c) is not PCN-traffic, therefore ideally a
            PCN-ingress ought not to interfere with it, but it has to do
            something to avoid ambiguous packet markings. Clearing the ECN
            field is not an appropriate policing action, because a network
            node ought not to interfere with an e2e signal. Even if such
            packets seem like an attack, drop would be overkill, because such
            an attack can be neutralised by just re-marking the DSCP. And DSCP
            re-marking in the network is legitimate, because the DSCP is not
            considered an e2e signal.</t>

            <t hangText="3. PCN-colouring:">If a packet has been classified as
            a PCN-packet, once it has been policed, the PCN-ingress-node:<list

                <t>MUST set a PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint on all

        this, e.g. by carrying e2e ECN across a PCN-domain within the inner
        header of an IP-in-IP tunnel. The normative text in <xref
        target="pcn3in1_common_ingress_behaviour"></xref> requires one of
        these methods to be configured at the PCN-ingress-node and recommends
        that implementations offer tunnelling as the default.</t>

        <t>In any PCN deployment, traffic can only enter the PCN-domain
        through PCN-ingress-nodes and leave through PCN-egress-nodes.
        PCN-ingress-nodes ensure that any packets entering the PCN-domain have
        the ECN field in their outermost IP header set to the appropriate
        codepoint. PCN-egress-nodes then guarantee that the ECN field of any
        packet leaving the PCN-domain has appropriate ECN semantics. This
        prevents unintended leakage of ECN marks into or out of the
        PCN-domain, and thus reduces backward-compatibility issues.</t>

      <section title="Backward Compatibility with the RFC5696 Encoding">
        <t>Section 5.1 of the PCN architecture gives general guidance on fault
        detection and diagnosis <xref target="RFC5559"></xref>, including
        management analysis of PCN markings arriving at PCN-egress nodes to
        detect early signs of potential faults. Because the PCN encoding has
        gone through an obsoleted earlier stage <xref
        target="RFC5696"></xref>, misconfiguration mistakes may be more
        likely. Therefore extra monitoring, such as in the following example,
        may be necessary to detect and diagnose potential problems:<list
            style="empty">
            <t>Informational example: In a controlled-load edge-behaviour
            scenario it could be worth the PCN-egress node detecting the onset
            of excess-traffic marking without any prior threshold-marking.
            This might indicate that an interior node has been wrongly
            configured to mark only ETM (which would have been correct for the
            single-marking edge-behaviour).</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>A PCN-node implemented to use the obsoleted RFC5696 encoding could
        conceivably have been configured so that the Threshold-meter function
        marked what is now defined as the ETM codepoint in the 3-in-1
        encoding. However, there is no known deployment of this rather
        unlikely variant of RFC5696 and no reason to believe that such an
        implementation would ever have been built. Therefore, it seems safe to
        ignore this issue.</t>

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_Sec_Consider" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>PCN-marking only carries a meaning within the confines of a
      PCN-domain. This encoding document is intended to stand independently of
      the architecture used to determine how specific packets are authorised
      to be PCN-marked, which will be described in separate documents on
      PCN-boundary-node behaviour.</t>

      <t>This document assumes the PCN-domain to be entirely under the control
      of a single operator, or a set of operators who trust each other.
      However, future extensions to PCN might include inter-domain versions
      where trust cannot be assumed between domains. If such schemes are
      proposed, they must ensure that they can operate securely despite the
      lack of trust. However, such considerations are beyond the scope of this
      document.</t>

      <t>One potential security concern is the injection of spurious PCN-marks
      into the PCN-domain. However, these can only enter the domain if a
      PCN-ingress-node is misconfigured. The precise impact of any such
      misconfiguration will depend on which of the proposed PCN-boundary-node
      behaviours is used, but in general spurious marks will lead to admitting
      fewer flows into the domain or potentially terminating too many flows.
      In either case, good management should be able to quickly spot the
      problem since the overall utilisation of the domain will rapidly
      fall.</t>

      <t>The 3-in-1 PCN encoding uses a PCN-compatible DSCP and the ECN field

      with the same PCN-compatible DSCP and three other codepoints support
      three PCN marking states with different levels of severity. In general,

          <abstract>
            <t>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to
            protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a
            Diffserv domain. On every link in the PCN domain, the overall rate
            of the PCN-traffic is metered, and PCN-packets are appropriately
            marked when certain configured rates are exceeded. Egress nodes
            provide decision points with information about the PCN-marks of
            PCN-packets which allows them to take decisions about whether to
            admit or block a new flow request, and to terminate some already
            admitted flows during serious pre- congestion. The PCN Working
            Group explored a number of approaches for encoding this
            pre-congestion information into the IP header. This document
            provides details of all those approaches along with an explanation
            of the constraints that had to be met by any solution.</t>

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_app_DSCP_choice" title="Choice of Suitable DSCPs">
      <t>This appendix is informative, not normative.</t>

      <t>A single DSCP has not been defined for use with PCN for several
      reasons. Firstly, the PCN mechanism is applicable to a variety of
      different traffic classes. Secondly, Standards Track DSCPs are in
      increasingly short supply. Thirdly, PCN is not a scheduling behaviour --
      rather, it should be seen as being a marking behaviour similar to ECN
      but intended for inelastic traffic. The choice of which DSCP is most
      suitable for a given PCN-domain is dependent on the nature of the
      traffic entering that domain and the link rates of all the links making
      up that domain. In PCN-domains with sufficient aggregation, the
      appropriate DSCPs would currently be those for the Real-Time Treatment
      Aggregate <xref target="RFC5127"></xref>. It is suggested that admission
      control could be used for the following service classes (defined in
      <xref target="RFC4594"></xref> unless otherwise stated): <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Telephony (EF)</t>

          <t>Real-time interactive (CS4)</t>

          <t>Broadcast Video (CS3)</t>

          <t>Multimedia Conferencing (AF4)</t>

          <t>the VOICE-ADMIT codepoint defined in <xref
          target="RFC5865"></xref>.</t>
        </list>CS5 is excluded from this list since PCN is not expected to be
      applied to signalling traffic.</t>

      <t>PCN-marking is intended to provide a scalable admission-control
      mechanism for traffic with a high degree of statistical multiplexing.
      PCN-marking would therefore be appropriate to apply to traffic in the
      above classes, but only within a PCN-domain containing sufficiently
      aggregated traffic. In such cases, the above service classes may well
      all be subject to a single forwarding treatment (treatment aggregate
      <xref target="RFC5127"></xref>). However, this does not imply all such
      IP traffic would necessarily be identified by one DSCP -- each service
      class might keep a distinct DSCP within the highly aggregated region
      <xref target="RFC5127"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Guidelines for conserving DSCPs by allowing
      non-admission-controlled-traffic to compete with PCN-traffic are given
      in Appendix B.1 of <xref target="RFC5670"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Additional service classes may be defined for which admission control
      is appropriate, whether through some future standards action or through
      local use by certain operators, e.g., the Multimedia Streaming service
      class (AF3). This document does not preclude the use of PCN in more
      cases than those listed above.</t>

      <t>Note: The above discussion is informative not normative, as operators
      are ultimately free to decide whether to use admission control for
      certain service classes and whether to use PCN as their mechanism of
      choice.</t>

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_app_ecn_coexist"
             title="Co-existence of ECN and PCN">
      <t>This appendix is informative, not normative. It collects together
      material relevant to co-existence of ECN and PCN, including that spread
      throughout the body of this specification. If this results in any
      conflict or ambiguity, the normative text in the body of the
      specification takes precedence.</t>

      <t>ECN <xref target="RFC3168"></xref> is an e2e congestion notification
      mechanism. As such it is possible that some traffic entering the
      PCN-domain may also be ECN-capable. The PCN encoding described in this
      document re-uses the bits of the ECN field in the IP header.
      Consequently, this disables ECN within the PCN domain.</t>

      <t>For the purposes of this appendix we define two forms of traffic that
      might arrive at a PCN-ingress-node. These are admission-controlled
      traffic (PCN-traffic) and non-admission-controlled traffic
      (non-PCN-traffic).</t>

      <t>Flow signalling identifies admission controlled traffic, by
      associating a filterspec with the need for admission control (e.g.
      through RSVP or some equivalent message, e.g. from a SIP server to the
      ingress or from a logically centralised network control system). The
      PCN-ingress-node re-marks admission-conrolled traffic matching that
      filterspec to a PCN-compatible DSCP. Note that the term flow need not
      imply just one microflow, but instead could match an aggregate and/or
      could depend on the incoming DSCP (see <xref
      target="pcn3in1_app_DSCP_choice"></xref>).</t>

      <t>All other traffic can be thought of as non-admission-controlled (and
      therefore outside the scope of PCN). However such traffic may still need
      to share the same DSCP as the admission-controlled traffic. This may be
      due to policy (for instance if it is high priority voice traffic), or
      may be because there is a shortage of local DSCPs.</t>

      <t>Unless specified otherwise, for any of the cases in the list below,
      an IP-in-IP tunnel that complies with<xref target="RFC6040"></xref> can
      be used to preserve ECN markings across the PCN domain. The tunnelling
      action should be applied wholly outside the PCN-domain as illustrated in
      <xref target="pcn3in1_Fig_Tunnel"></xref>. Then, by the rules of
      RFC6040, the tunnel egress propagates the ECN field from the inner
      header, because the PCN-egress will have zeroed the outer ECN field.</t>

      <t>There are three cases for how e2e ECN traffic may wish to be treated

                  scheduling PHB as the original DSCP, and the egress re-maps

                  <t>The ingress tunnels the traffic, setting the DSCP in the

                  <t>The ingress tunnels the traffic, using the original DSCP
                  in the outer but setting Not-PCN in the outer header; note
                  that this turns off ECN for this traffic within the PCN
                  domain.</t>

              the ECN-field before decapsulation.</t>

              <t>The PCN-ingress-node drops CE-marked packets and otherwise
              sets the ECN-field to NM and sets the DCSP to a PCN-compatible
              DSCP. The PCN-egress zeroes the ECN field of all PCN packets;
              note that this turns off e2e ECN.</t>
            </list>The second option is emphatically not recommended, unless
          perhaps as a last resort if tunnelling is not possible for some

          hangText="c) Traffic that requires PCN admission control where the endpoints ask to see PCN marks:"><vspace

          adaptive codec, schemes have been suggested where PCN marks may be
          leaked out of the PCN-domain so that end hosts can drop to a lower
          data-rate, thus deferring the need for admission control. Currently
          such schemes require further study and the following is for guidance
          only.<vspace blankLines="1" />The PCN-ingress-node needs to tunnel
          the traffic as in <xref target="pcn3in1_Fig_Tunnel"></xref>, taking
          care to comply with <xref target="RFC6040"></xref>. In this case the
          PCN-egress does not zero the ECN field contrary to the
          recommendation in <xref target="pcn3in1_egress_behaviour"></xref>,
          so that the <xref target="RFC6040"></xref> tunnel egress will
          preserve any PCN-marking. Note that a PCN-interior-node may change
          the ECN-field from 10 to 01 (NM to ThM), which would be interpreted
          by the e2e ECN as a change from ECT(0) into ECT(1). This would not
          be compatible with the (currently experimental) ECN nonce <xref

             title="Example Mapping between Encoding of PCN-Marks in IP and in MPLS Shim Headers">
      <t>This appendix is informative not normative.</t>

      <t>The 6 bits of the DS field in the IP header provide for 64
      codepoints. When encapsulating IP traffic in MPLS, it is useful to make
      the DS field information accessible in the MPLS header. However, the
      MPLS shim header has only a 3-bit traffic class (TC) field <xref
      target="RFC5462"></xref> providing for 8 codepoints. The operator has
      the freedom to define a site-local mapping of the 64 codepoints of the
      DS field onto the 8 codepoints in the TC field.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5129"></xref> describes how ECN markings in the IP
      header can also be mapped to codepoints in the MPLS TC field. Appendix A
      of <xref target="RFC5129"></xref> gives an informative description of
      how to support PCN in MPLS by extending the way MPLS supports ECN. <xref
      target="RFC5129"></xref> was written while PCN specifications were in
      early draft stages. The following provides a clearer example of a
      mapping between PCN in IP and in MPLS using the PCN terminology and
      concepts that have since been specified.</t>

      <t>To support PCN in a MPLS domain, a PCN-compatible DSCP ('DSCP n')
      needs codepoints to be provided in the TC field for all the PCN-marks
      used. That means, when for instance only excess-traffic-marking is used
      for PCN purposes, the operator needs to define a site-local mapping to
      two codepoints in the MPLS TC field for IP headers with: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>DSCP n and NM</t>

          <t>DSCP n and ETM</t>
        </list> If both excess-traffic-marking and threshold-marking are used,
      the operator needs to define a site-local mapping to codepoints in the
      MPLS TC field for IP headers with all three of the 3-in-1 codepoints:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>DSCP n and NM</t>

          <t>DSCP n and ThM</t>

          <t>DSCP n and ETM</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In either case, if the operator wishes to support the same Diffserv
      PHB but without PCN marking, it will also be necessary to define a
      site-local mapping to an MPLS TC codepoint for IP headers marked with:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>DSCP n and Not-PCN</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The above sets of codepoints are required for every PCN-compatible
      DSCP. Clearly, given so few TC codepoints are available, it may be
      necessary to compromise by merging together some capabilities.
      Guidelines for conserving TC codepoints by allowing
      non-admission-controlled-traffic to compete with PCN-traffic are given
      in Appendix B.1 of <xref target="RFC5670"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_app_rationale_diff_sm"
             title="Rationale for Difference Between the Schemes using One PCN-Marking">
      <t>Readers may notice a difference between the two behaviours in <xref
      target="pcn3in1_interior_ETM_only"></xref> and <xref
      target="pcn3in1_interior_ThM_only"></xref>. With only
      Excess-traffic-marking enabled, an unexpected ThM packet can be
      re-marked to ETM. However, with only Threshold-marking, an unexpected
      ETM packet cannot be re-marked to ThM.</t>

      <t>This apparent inconsistency is deliberate. The behaviour with only
      Threshold-marking keeps to the rule of <xref
      target="pcn3in1_common_interior_behaviour"></xref> that ETM is more
      severe and must never be changed to ThM even though ETM is not a valid
      marking in this case. Otherwise implementations would have to allow
      operators to configure an exception to this rule, which would not be
      safe practice and would require different code in the data-plane
      compared to the common behaviour.</t>
