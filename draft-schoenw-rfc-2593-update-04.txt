The Script MIB extensibility protocol (SMX) defined in this memo
separates language specific runtime systems from language independent
Script MIB implementations.  The IETF Script MIB defines an interface
for the delegation of management functions based on the Internet
management framework.  A management script is a set of instructions
that are executed by a language specific runtime system.

This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Discussion and
suggestions for improvement are requested.  Distribution of this memo
