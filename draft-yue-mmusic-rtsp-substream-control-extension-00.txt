Internet-Draft    RTSP Extension for Substream Control      October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Single Session Transmission (SST) is recommended for the SVC (
   Scalable Video Codec) video transport [RFC6190] and MVC (Multiview
   Video Codec) video transport [I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-mvc] .  In SST, a
   single RTP session conveys all the related media data, namely all the
   bitstream components.  A bitstream component here is part of a media
   stram that has a common property which could be:
   o  Layer: in SVC media stream; In this case, a bitstream component is
      media data of a specific layer.
   o  View: in MVC media stream; In this case, a bitstream component is
      media data of a specific view.

   In such a SST session,one or several bitstream components together
   may be decodable by themselves and therefore make sense to the
   receiver.  These bitstream component(s) combinations are here called
   Substream.

   In SVC and MVC RTP sessions, such a Substream is identified by an
   Operation Point.

   There are cases that a client wants to retrieve a specific substream
   in such a SST session.  However, in the current RTSP 2.0 protocol,
   the control of the media is on media stream basis, e.g. as an RTP
   session when RTP is used.  This prevents a client to receive only
   certain substream(s) from the media.

   This memo extends the RTSP 2.0[I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis] to
   establish a substream playback control framework, which enables a
   client to play a part of a media stream.

   This memo also defines the substream usage for SVC and MVC.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   o  Substream: a part of a media stream containing one or more
      bitstream components, which can be independently decoded.
      Typically a Substream is identified by one operation point.
   o  Substream type: the compound mode of the bitstream components in a
      substream, e.g.  SVC, MVC, etc

      MVC: Multiview Video Coding
      SST: Single Session Transmission


4.  Protocol Overview

   The whole framework includes substream annotation, capability
   negotiation and substream playback control.  This section provides an
   overview of substream control.

4.1.  Substream Annotation

   Substream annotation is used to announce identifiers for all
   substreams available in a media stream. which can be retrieved
   selectively.  It is done through a presentation description,
   typically using an SDP description.  Substream annotation based on
   SDP is described in this section.  Substream annotation based on
   other formats is out of scope of this document.

   In SVC, a substream is described as an operation point, which
   consists of the bitstream components required to be able to decode a
   particular dependency_id, quality_id, and temporal_id combination.
   SVC operation points are described through the sprop-operation-point-
   info attribute in SDP as defined in [RFC6190].

   According to [RFC6190], the value of sprop-operation-point-info
   consists of a comma-separated list of operation-point-description
   vectors.  Each operation-point-description vector represents a
   substream.  Each operation-point-description vector has ten
   elements,where the first element layer-ID is the identifier of the
   operation point.  This layer-ID can be taken as the identifier for
   the SVC substream.  Since the layer-ID is optional, it may not be
   included.  In this case, a [dependency-ID, temporal_ID, quality-ID]
   combination is taken as the identifier instead.

   Annocation of MVC substreams is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-mvc].

Internet-Draft    RTSP Extension for Substream Control      October 2011


   [I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-mvc].

4.2.  Capability Negotiation

   Capability negotiation can be used to negotiate support of substream
   control between RTSP client and server.  It makes use of the RTSP
   feature tag mechanism defined in RTSP
   2.0[I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].  A new feature tag (play.substream)
   is defined in Section 5.2.

   Whenever it has received a media presentation with substream
   annotation, a substream control capable RTSP client SHALL include
   play.substream in the SUPPORTED header of the RTSP SETUP request.
   This indicates that the client is able to control the playback of the
   media on substream basis.

   A 2xx response implies that the server is capable of substream
   control.  A server MAY refuse the request with a 551 "Option not
   supported" response, with an UNSUPPORT header including
   play.substream.

   The receiving client may try to setup a session without this feature
   later.  This means that the client will not perform substream control
   and play the media as a whole.  In the SVC case, the client will play
   all the layers in the session, whereas in the MVC case it will play
   all the views in the session.

4.3.  Substream Playback Control

   In case the session is setup correctly, the client may control the
   play back on substream basis, including:
   o  start to play a substream
   o  pause a substream.  Note that this means it will pause the play
      back of the whole session.

4.3.1.  Play a Substream

   After successful set up of an RTSP session, the client may perform
   substream playback control.  The playback of a substream is similar
   with the normal playback of a session, except that the PLAY request
   shall contain a "SubstreamCtrl" header with substream type and the
   substream id corresponding to the substream that the client intends
   to play.  Here the substream id idetifies a specific operation point.
   The actual definition of the substream id is defined by each
   substream type.

   When more than one media stream are controlled, the header shall
   further contain Request-URIs for each of the the substreams.

Internet-Draft    RTSP Extension for Substream Control      October 2011


   Following is the specification of substream types for SVC and MVC
   media stream.  Specification for other substream type is out of scope
   of current document and should be registered in IANA, as described in
   Section 7.4.

   When the media stream is an SVC stream as defined in [RFC6190], the
   substream type shall be "SVC"; The substream id could be either a
   layer-id or a [dependency-ID, temporal_ID, quality-ID] combination,
   which comes from an operation-point-description vector.

   When the media stream is an MVC stream as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-mvc], the substream type shall be "MVC".

   For MVC, substream id is...

   editor's note: substream id for MVC is pending on the complement of
   draft-ietf-payload-rtp-mvc-00.

   A client should not perform substream play if the server has not
   indicated support of substream control in an ealier message exchange.

   Upon receiving a PLAY request with a "SubstreamCtrl" header, the
   server SHALL identify the substream(s) according to the id(s) and
   Request-URI(s) in the request, and then provides the indicated
   substream(s) after sending a 200 OK response.

   If the server doesn't support substream control, it should respond a
   551 "Option not supported" response as defined in RTSP
   2.0[I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].

   If the server supports substream control but the substream type
   indicated in the "SubstreamCtrl" header is not recognized, it shall
   response wth a 552 "Substream Type Not Recognizable" response, see
   Section 5.3.1.

   If the server supports substream control but the substream type
   indicated in the "SubstreamCtrl" header is not recognized, it shall
   response wth 552 "Substream Type Not Recognizable", see
   Section 5.3.1.

   If a requested media is not allowed to be played on substream basis
   as requested, the server SHALL respond with a 553 "Substream Control
   Not Allowed" response, see Section 5.3.2.

   If the requested substream id is not valid, the server shall response
   with 554 "Substream id not valid", see Section 5.3.3.

Internet-Draft    RTSP Extension for Substream Control      October 2011


4.3.2.  Pause a Substream

   The pause operation of a substream is identical to the pause
   operation of a normal session.  It is not necessary for the client to
   include a "SubstreamCtrl" header in the pause request message.
   However, if the request includes a "SubstreamCtrl" header, it shall
   list all the substreams are currently played.

   If aggregated control is used, it is not allowed to pause only a part
   of a session.  It is also not allowed to pause only a specific
   substream from a media stream.


5.  RTSP Extensions

   This section documentsthe extension to the RTSP 2.0 specification.
   Specifically Section 5.1 specifies the SubstreamCtrl header,
   Section 5.2 specifies the substream control feature tag, Section 5.3
   specifies the status codes extentions for the substream control
   feature.

5.1.  Substream Header

   SustreamCtrl header is used to indicate the substream(s) of a media
   stream that the client intends to play.  It contains one or more
   [stream uri, substream type, substream id] triple.

   The syntax is:

           substream = "substream:" substream-id * (";" sustream-id)
           substream-id = stream-uri "," substream-type "," substream_id
           stream-uri = RTSP-URI
           substream-type = "SVC" / "MVC" / token

   When the substream-type is SVC, the syntax of substream_id is:

           substream_id     = layer-id
                           /dependency-id "," temporal-id "," quality-id
           layer-id                = "layer_id=" layer_id_value
           layer_id_value  = 1*4DIGIT; 0~2047
           dependency-id   = "dependency_id=" dependency_id_value
           dependency_id_value = DIGIT ; 0~7
           temporal-id     = "temporal_id="  temporal_id_value
           temporal_id_value = DIGIT ; 0~7
           quality-id              = "quality_id=" quality_id_value
           quality_id_value = 1*2DIGIT; 0~15
           DIGIT           =  %x30-39 ; any US-ASCII digit "0".."9"

Internet-Draft    RTSP Extension for Substream Control      October 2011


   An example of Substream header is: substream:
   rtsp://example.com/svc.mp4, SVC, lay-id=1

   For the MVC case, the syntax of substream_id is:

   editor's notes: pending on the complement of mvc-operation-point-id

           HCOLON  =  *( SP / HT ) ":" SWS
           SEMI    =  SWS ";" SVS ; semicolon
           SWS             =  [LWS] ; Separating White Space
           DIGIT           =  %x30-39 ; any US-ASCII digit "0".."9"
           COMMA   =  SWS "," SWS ; comma
           EQUAL           =  SWS "=" SWS ; equal

   SubstreamCtrl header can be used in PLAY and PAUSE request.  Proxies
   shall not modify this header and pass through to the server.

5.2.  Play.substream Feature Tag

   The following feature-tag is defined in this specification and hereby
   registered.  The change control belongs to the IETF. play.substream:
   Support of substream control operations for media playback.  Applies

5.3.  Status Code Extension

   This clause defines the status code extended for the substream
   control feature.  They are:
   o  552 Substream Type Not Recognized
   o  553 Substream Control Not Allowed
   o  554 Substream Id Not Valid

5.3.1.  552 Substream Type Not Recognized

   The server can not understand the substream type.

5.3.2.  553 Substream Control Not Allowed

   The substream specified in the request is not allowed for the media
   identified by the Request-URI.  The response shall include a xxxx
   header to indicate the substream information.

   Editor notes: whether there is a need to return substream information
   is pending for discussion.
