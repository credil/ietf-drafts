1.  Introduction

   A Large-scale Measurement Platform (LMP) is composed by the following
   fundamental elements: a set of Measurement Agents (MAs), one or more
   Controllers and one or more Collectors.  There may be additional
   elements in any given such of these platforms, but these three
   elements are present in all of them.  The MAs are pieces of code that
   run in specialized hardware (hardware probes) or in general purpose
   devices such as PCs, laptops or mobile phones (software probes).  The
   MA run the tests against other MAs distributed across the Internet.
   Typically most of the MAs are located in end user networks and a few
   MAs are located deep into the ISP network, and typically tests are
   executed from the MAs in the periphery towards MAs located in the
   core.  The Controller is the element that controls the MAs and
   informs the MAs about what tests to do and when to do them.  The
   protocol between the Controller and the MA is called the Control
   protocol.  After performing the tests, the MAs send the data about
   the results of the tests performed to the Collector.  The protocol
   used to report test result data from the MA to the Collector is
   called the Report protocol.  In this document we explore the
   possibility of using IPFIX [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol-rfc5101bis] as a
   Report protocol for large scale measurement platforms.

1.1.  A quick introduction to IPFIX

   IPFIX [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol-rfc5101bis] is a unidirectional,
   transport-independent export protocol for binary data records, with a
   focus on network measurement and operations applications.  The
   structure of the data records is described in-band by Templates,
   which refer to Information Elements (IEs) from a common information
   model managed by IANA [ipfix-iana].  The basic IEs cover most Layer 3
   and Layer 4 measurement needs, and the information model can be
   extended [I-D.ietf-ipfix-ie-doctors] as well as supplemented by
   private IEs.

   IPFIX organizes data records into Messages.  A Message is a sequence
   of Sets preceded by a Message Header which, among other things,
   includes an Observation Domain ID (roughly, identifying where the
   records in the Message were measured) and an Export Time (when the
   Message was originally sent).

   A Set contains Records preceded by a Set Header, which contains a Set
   ID identifying the type of the records the Set contains.  Template
   Sets, idenfied by a special Set ID, contain Templates, which are
   sequences of IE identifiers and lengths; these define the fields of
   the records they describe.  A Template's ID matches the Set ID of the
   Sets containing records described by the Template.

Internet-Draft                 LMAP-IPFIX                  February 2013


   On-wire data structures in IPFIX are fully discussed in section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol-rfc5101bis].

   Since many records may be described by a single Template, IPFIX's
   data representation is more efficient than those based on inline
   record structures (e.g.  XML, JSON).  Additionally, this arrangement
   implies that a device that only needs to export one or two fixed-
   length record types can implement IPFIX with minimal code supporting
   fixed message and set lengths with fixed-length templates.

   IPFIX also supports a feature called Options Templates.  An Options
   Template allows a data record to be scoped to a set of values of
   particular IEs (called its Scope).  For example, a set of test
   parameters could be scoped to a test identifier IE, and that test
   identifier exported in a record together with the results.  This
   mechanism allows more efficient data export, as explored in Section 4
   below; more information is available in [RFC5473].

1.2.  Applying IPFIX to LMAP

   In IPFIX terminology [RFC5470], the MA encompasses both the Metering
   Process (MP) and the Exporting Process (EP), while the Collector is
   the Collecting Process (CP).  IPFIX is used between the EP/MA and the
   Collector/CP.  We propose LMA as an application of IPFIX per
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-ie-doctors].

   Some considerations about the use of IPFIX for LMP:
   o  Separation between Control and Report Protocols: Within a single
      measurement platform, different protocols can be used for Control
      and Report, though they must share a common vocabulary
      representing the measurements to be performed.  In particular, if
      a platform implements IPFIX as a Report protocol, it must
      implement a different protocol (e.g.  NETCONF or other) as a
      Control protocol.
   o  Report protocol diversity: Some platforms may use IPFIX as a
      Report protocol, while other platforms may decide to use other
      protocols (e.g. the Broadband forum architecture may decide to use
      a different one).  We believe that it is important to support this
      protocol diversity.  A key element to support such diversity is an
      independent metric registry (see
      [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent] ) where values for
      metric identifiers are recorded independently of the Control
      and/or Report protocol is used.  This affects how we use IPFIX as
      a Report protocol, as presented in this document.
   o  Minimal IPFIX implementation: The unidirectional nature of the
      protocol and simple wire format make minimal implementations of
      Exporting Processes possible.  These minimal implementations are
      well suited to small-scale MAs (such as a mobile app or a process

      running in a home router).  These only need to know about the
      specific Templates supporting the metric(s) to be reported.


2.  Using IPFIX to report test results

   In order to use IPFIX to report test results from the MA to the
   Collector, we need first to understand what information needs to be
   conveyed.  The information transmitted by the MA to the Collector
   when reporting test(s) results is the following:
   o  Information about the MA: in particular a MA identifier
   o  Information about the time of the report: when the report was sent
      (not necessarily when the test was performed)
   o  Information describing the test.  This includes:
      *  An identifier of the metric used for the test (see the Metric
         registry of [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent] )
      *  An identifier of the scheduling strategy used to perform the
         test (see the Scheduling registry of
         [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent]) and potential
         input parameters for the schedule, such as the rate.
      *  An identifier of the output format, (see the Output Type
         registry of [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent] )
      *  An identifier of the environment, notably, if cross traffic was
         or not present during the execution of the test. (see the
         Environment registry of
         [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent] )
      *  The input parameters for the test, such as source IP address,
         destination IP address, source and destination ports and so on.
   o  Information describing the test results.  This widely varies with
      each test, but can include time each packet was sent and received,
      number of sent and lost packets or other information.
   We next explore how we can encode this information in IPFIX.

   In order to convey test information using IPFIX we will naturally use
   the IPFIX message format and we will define a Template describing the
   records containing the test result data.  We will re-use as many
   already defined Information Elements (IEs) as possible and we will
   identify new IEs that are needed.

   Part of the information can be conveyed using the fields in the IPFIX
   header, namely:
   o  Information about the MA: In order to convey the MA identifier we
      can use the Observation Domain field present in the IPFIX header.
      This would allow to have up to 2^32 MA, which seems sufficient.
   o  Information about the time of the report: The IPFIX header
      contains an Export Time field that can be used to convey this
      information.

Internet-Draft                 LMAP-IPFIX                  February 2013


   The information describing the test is included in a Template set
   that contains multiple IEs for each of the different pieces of
   information we need to convey.  This includes:
   o  An identifier of the metric used for the test.  In order to convey
      that we need to define a new IE, let's call it metricIdentifier.
      The values for this element will be the values registered in the
      Metric registry of [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent].
   o  An identifier of the scheduling strategy used to perform the test.
      Again, this will be a new IE, called testSchedule and its values
      will be the values defined in the Scheduling registry of
      [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent].  The potential input
      parameters for the schedule, such as the rate, we probably need a
      new IE for each of these.  Usual scheduling distributions only
      require a rate, so we can define a new IE called scheduleRate
      which value will contain the rate for the requested distribution.
      *  NOTE: The distribution in some cases could be extracted from
         the results, for example, if the results contain each packet
         sent, it would be easy to spot a periodic scheduling.  Probably
         not so obvious for the Poisson one.  Maybe this would be an
         optional element to be carried when it is not possible to
         extract it from the test results.
   o  An identifier of the output format.  A new IE outputType is needed
      for this and it would take values out of the ones in the Output
      Type registry of [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent].
      Some of the output formats require an additional input, like the
      percentile used to trim the outliers when performing means.  There
      are two approaches here.  One approach is that the the Output Type
      registry creates different entries for the different percentiles,
      which would result in more entries in the Output Type registry
      (e.g. one entry for the 95th percentile mean and another one for
      the 90th percentile mean).  This may cause an increase number of
      entries in the Output Type registry, but since there are not too
      many usual values, it is likely to be manageable.  The other
      approach is to define an additional IE, for instance, the
      percentile IE that will have the values for the different
      percentiles used in the output.
   o  An identifier of the environment, notably, if cross traffic was or
      not present during the execution of the test.  Again, a new IE is
      needed for this testEnvironment.  It will take values of the the
      Environment registry of
      [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent].
   o  The input parameters for the test.  Most of these can be expressed
      using existing IEs, such as sourceIPv4Address,
      destinationIPv4Address, etc.

   Information describing the test results.  This widely varies with
   each test, but can include time each packet was sent and received,
   number of sent and lost packets or other information.  Again most of

Internet-Draft                 LMAP-IPFIX                  February 2013


   these can be expressed using existent IEs, and some new ones can be
   defined if needed for a particular test.


3.  Example: UDP latency test

   Let's consider the example of UDP latency.  Suppose a MA wants to
   report the results of a UDP latency test, performed from its own IP
   address (e.g. 192.0.2.1) to a destination IP address (e.g.
   203.0.113.1), using source port 23677 and destination port 34567.
   The test is performed using a periodic scheduling with a rate of 1
   packet per second during 3 seconds and starts at 10:00 CEST.  The
   test was performed without cross-traffic and the output type is raw.

   The Template for this would be:
      metricIdentifier
      testSchedule
      scheduleRate
      outputType
      testEnvironment
      sourceIPv4Address
      destinationIPv4Address
      sourceTransportPort
      destinationTransportPort
      flowStartMilliseconds
      flowEndMilliseconds

   The data set following this template for the example would be:
      metricIdentifier = UDP_Latency as per
      [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent]
      testSchedule = Periodic as per
      [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent]
      scheduleRate = 1
      outputType = Raw as per
      [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent]
      testEnvironment = No-cross-traffic as per
      [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent]
      sourceIPv4Address = 192.0.2.1
      destinationIPv4Address = 203.0.113.1
      sourceTransportPort = 23677
      destinationTransportPort = 34567
      flowStartMilliseconds = 08:00:00.000 UTC
      flowEndMilliseconds = 08:00:00.001 UTC

      metricIdentifier = UDP_Latency as per
      [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent]

      flowEndMilliseconds = 08:00:01.002 UTC

      sourceTransportPort = 23677
      destinationTransportPort = 34567
      flowStartMilliseconds = 08:00:02.000 UTC
      flowEndMilliseconds = 08:00:02.001 UTC
      ---------------------------


4.  Example: UDP latency test with Options

   In the previous example, the test description is exported together
   with the results in the record.  If a particular set of test
   parameters will be repeated often by a given MA, the common
   properties can be grouped into an Options record, described by an
   Options Template and identified by a new Information Element, with
   Data Records referring back to this identifier.

   In this case, two templates are used: an Options Template to

   The Options Template would be:
      testParametersId {scope}
      metricIdentifier





Bagnulo & Trammell       Expires August 25, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                 LMAP-IPFIX                  February 2013


      testSchedule
      scheduleRate
      outputType
      testEnvironment
      sourceIPv4Address
      destinationIPv4Address
      sourceTransportPort
      destinationTransportPort

   The Template for each Data Record carrying results would be:
      testParametersId {scope}
      flowStartMilliseconds
      flowEndMilliseconds

   The data set carrying the common properties would be:
      testParametersId = 1
      metricIdentifier = UDP_Latency as per
      [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent]
      testSchedule = Periodic as per
      [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent]
      scheduleRate = 1
      outputType = Raw as per
      [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent]
      testEnvironment = No-cross-traffic as per
      [I-D.bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent]
      sourceIPv4Address = 192.0.2.1
      destinationIPv4Address = 203.0.113.1
      sourceTransportPort = 23677
      destinationTransportPort = 34567
      ---------------------------

   And the data set carrying results would be:
      testParametersId = 1
      flowStartMilliseconds = 08:00:00.000 UTC
      flowEndMilliseconds = 08:00:00.001 UTC
      ---------------------------
      testParametersId = 1
      flowStartMilliseconds = 08:00:01.000 UTC
      flowEndMilliseconds = 08:00:01.002 UTC
      ---------------------------
      testParametersId = 1
      flowStartMilliseconds = 08:00:02.000 UTC
      flowEndMilliseconds = 08:00:02.001 UTC
      ---------------------------

   This approach sacrifices some complexity at the MA (which must assign
   testParametersIds and use multiple Templates) and the collector
   (which must track testParametersId of each set of parameters to

   reassemble "complete" results) to gain export efficiency.  A
   quantitative measurement of efficiency gains and tradeoffs for a set
   of specified result records will follow in a future version of this
   draft.


5.  What standardization is needed for this?

   So, in order to enable the use of IPFIX for LMP, the following pieces
   of standardization would be required.
   o  The definition of the metric registry.  This is not specific for
      IPFIX as any other Report protocol is likely to require this, but
      having an independent registry enables multiple report protocols.
   o  The definition of new IEs.  Some of them are identified above,
      some other are likely to be needed as well.
   o  The definition of the Templates sets for each of the tests to be
      performed.  This is necessary to have a defined Template that
      different vendors can implement and can use the IPFIX format in
      the wire, but they don't need to fully implement IPFIX parsing to
      read arbitrary Template sets, just the ones associated with the
      relevant metrics.


6.  Security considerations

   The security requirements for the protocol between the MA and the
   collector have been identified in [I-D.eardley-lmap-framework] and in
   [I-D.schulzrinne-lmap-requirements].  The identified requirements
   are:
   o  Mutual authentication and authorization between the MA and the
      collector.  This means that the collector must be able to verify
      the identity of the MA and to also verify that the MA is
      authorized to feed data into the collector and that the MA must be
      able to verify the identity of the collector and recognize it as a
      valid collector for the data it is reporting.
   o  The information flowing between the MA and the collector must be
      confidential.
   o  The integrity of the information flowing from the MA and the
      collector must be protected.

   Not surprisingly these are exactly the same requirements imposed to
   the design of the IPFIX protocol, in particular for the flow of data
   between the EP and the CP.  As described in the security
   considerations of IPFIX [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol-rfc5101bis], IPFIX
   address these requirements by imposing the use of TLS or DTLS with
   mutual authentication though certificates.  The authorization relies
   on having a list of authorized MAs in the collector and a list of
   collectors in the MAs, identified by information in the Distinguished

   Name and/or Common Name of their certificate.  Current IPFIX
   specifications and implementations already support TLS and DTLS and
   this covers the aforementioned requirements.  We are aware that some
   of the current platforms use ssh as a transport protocol between the
   MAs and the collector.  Using ssh allow avoiding the use of
   certificates, but may result in a more complex key management (which
   may not be an issue in certain deployments).  We believe it would be
   possible to define an ssh transport for IPFIX if deemed necessary.

   IPFIX recommends the use DNS-IDs in the certificates, which applies
   to EPs and CPs with relatively static addressing.  This is probably
   not a good fit for MAs, since they are likely to have a dynamic
   address.  In this draft we have proposed to use the Observation
   domain as identifier for the MAs.  While the Observation domain must
   not be globally unique within IPFIX, it would be possible to make it
   so in a particular measurement platform.  The Observation Domain
   Identifier could then appear in the Common Name of the certificate in
   some form.  Additionally, access control in very large deployments
   could rely not on identifying specific MAs, but on ensuring that a
   peer MA or collector had a certificate signed by one of a set of
   specified authorized issuers.
