           draft-ietf-netext-logical-interface-support-06.txt

Abstract

   A Logical Interface is a software semantic internal to the host
   operating system.  This semantic is available in all popular
   operating systems and is used in various protocol implementations.
   The Logical Interface support is required on the mobile node
   operating in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, for leveraging various
   network-based mobility management features such as inter-technology
   handoffs, multihoming and flow mobility support.  This document
   explains the operational details of Logical Interface construct and
   the specifics on how the link-layer implementations hide the physical
   interfaces from the IP stack and from the network nodes on the
   attached access networks.  Furthermore, this document identifies the
   applicability of this approach to various link-layer technologies and
   analyzes the issues around it when used in context with various
   mobility management features.

1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network-based mobility protocol.
   Some of the key goals of the protocol include support for
   multihoming, inter-technology handoffs and flow mobility support.
   The base protocol features specified in [RFC5213] and [RFC5844] allow
   the mobile node to attach to the network using multiple interfaces
   (simultaneously or sequentially), or to perform handoff between
   different interfaces of the mobile node.  However, for supporting
   these features, the mobile node is required to be activated with
   specific software configuration that allows the mobile node to either
   perform inter-technology handoffs between different interfaces,
   attach to the network using multiple interfaces, or perform flow
   movement from one access technology to another.  This document
   analyzes from the mobile node's perspective a specific approach that
   allows the mobile node to leverage these mobility features.
   Specifically, it explores the use of the Logical Interface support, a
   semantic available on most operating systems.

   A Logical Interface is a construct internal to the operating system.
   It is an approach where the link-layer implementations hide the
   physical interfaces from the IP stack and from the network nodes on
   the attached access networks.  This semantic is widely available in
   all popular operating systems.  Many applications such as Mobile IP
   client [RFC6275] and IPsec VPN client [RFC4301] rely on this semantic
   for their protocol implementation and the same semantic can also be
   useful in this context.  Specifically, the mobile node can use the
   logical interface configuration for leveraging various network-based
   mobility management features provided by the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain
   [RFC5213].

   The rest of the document provides the operational details of a
   Logical Interface on the mobile node and the inter-working between a
   mobile node using logical interface and network elements in the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domain when supporting some of the mobility management
   features.  It also analyzes the issues involved with this approach
   and characterizes the contexts in which such usage is appropriate.

2.  Terminology

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications, [RFC5213]
   and [RFC5844].  In addition, this document introduces the following
   terms:

   PIF  (Physical Interface) - a network interface card attached to an
      an host providing network connectivity (e.g. an Ethernet card, a
      WLAN card, an LTE interface).

   LIF  (Logical Interface) - It is a virtual interface in the IP stack.
      It appears just as any other physical interface, provides similar
      semantics with respect to packet transmit and receive functions to
      the upper layers in the IP stack.  However, it is only logical
      construct and is not a representation of an instance of any
      physical hardware.

   VLL-ID  (Virtual Link-layer ID) - a virtual link-layer address
      configured on the logical interface.  This identifier can be
      randomly generated, or configured based on the link-layer address
      of one of the physical interface.

   Sub-If  (Sub Interface) - a physical interface that is part of a
      logical interface construct.  For example, a logical interface may
      have been created abstracting two physical interfaces, LTE and
      WLAN.  These physical interfaces, LTE and WLAN are referred to as
      sub-interfaces of that logical interface.  In some cases, a sub-
      interface can also be another logical interface, such as an IPsec
      tunnel interface.

3.  Hiding Link-layer Technologies - Approaches and Applicability

   There are several techniques/mechanisms that allow hiding access
   technology changes or movement from host IP layer.  This section
   classifies these existing techniques into a set of generic
   approaches, according to their most representative characteristics.
   Later sections of this document analyze the applicability of these
   solution approaches for supporting features such as, inter-technology
   handovers and IP flow mobility support for a mobile node in a Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domain [RFC5213].

3.1.  Link-layer Abstraction - Approaches

   The following generic mechanisms can hide access technology changes
   from host IP layer:

   o  Link-layer Support - Certain link-layer technologies are able to
      hide physical media changes from the upper layers (see Figure 1).
      For example, IEEE 802.11 is able to seamlessly change between IEEE
      802.11a/b/g physical layers.  Also, an 802.11 STA can move between
      different Access Points within the same domain without the IP
      stack being aware of the movement.  In this case, the IEEE 802.11
      MAC layer takes care of the mobility, making the media change
      invisible to the upper layers.  Another example is IEEE 802.3,
      that supports changing the rate from 10Mbps to 100Mbps and to
      1000Mbps.

      There are also other examples with more complicated architectures,
      like for instance, 3GPP EPC [TS23401].  In this case, a UE can
      move (inter-RA handover) between GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN, being this
      movement invisible to the IP layer at the UE, and also to the LMA
      logical component at the PGW.  The link layer stack at the UE
      (i.e.  PDCP and RLC layers), and the GTP between the RAN and the
      SGW (which plays the role of inter-3GPP AN mobility anchor) hide

   o  Logical interface: this refers to solutions (see Figure 3) that
      logically group/bond several physical interfaces so they appear to
      the upper layers (i.e.  IP) as one single interface (where
      application sockets bind).  Depending on the OS support, it might
      be possible to use more than one physical interface at a time --
      so the node is simultaneously attached to different media -- or
      just to provide a fail-over mode.  Controlling the way the
      different media is used (simultaneous, sequential attachment, etc)
      is not trivial and requires additional intelligence and/or
      configuration at the logical interface device driver.  An example
      of this type of solution is the Logical interface, which is
      defined in this document, or the bonding driver (a Linux
      implementation).

3.2.  Applicability Statement

   We now focus on the applicability of the above solutions against the
   following requirements:

   o  multi technology support

   o  sequential vs. simultaneous access

3.2.1.  Link layer support

   Link layer mobility support applies to cases when the same link layer
   technology is used and mobility can be fully handled at these layers.
   One example is the case where several 802.11 access points are
   deployed in the same subnet and all of them share higher layer
   resources such as DHCP server, IP gateway, etc.  In this case the
   access points can autonomously (or with the help of a central box)
   communicate and control the STA association changes from one AP to
   another, without the STA being aware of the movement.  This type of
   scenario is applicable to cases when the different points of
   attachment (i.e. access points) belong to the same network domain,
   e.g.  Enterprise, hotspots from same operator, etc.

   This type of solution does not typically allow for simultaneous
   attachment to different access networks, and therefore can only be
   considered for inter-access technology handovers, but not for flow
   mobility.  Existing RFC 5213 handover hint mechanisms could benefit
   from link layer information (e.g. triggers) to detect and identify MN
   handovers.

   Link layer support is not applicable when two different access
   technologies are involved (e.g. 802.11 WLAN and 802.16 WiMAX) and the
   same is true when the same access technology expands over multiple
   network domains.  This solution does not impose any change at the IP
   layer since changes in the access technology occur at layer two.

3.2.2.  Logical Interface

   The use of a logical interface allows the mobile node to provide a
   single interface view to the layers above IP (thus not changing the
   IP layer itself).  Upper layers can bind to this interface, which
   hides inner inter-access technology handovers or data flow transfers
   among different physical interfaces.

   This type of solution may support simultaneous attachment, in
   addition to sequential attachment.  It requires additional support at
   the node and the network in order to benefit from simultaneous
   attachment.  For example special mechanisms are required to enable
   addressing a particular interface from the network (e.g. for flow
   mobility).  In particular extensions to PMIPv6 are required in order
   to enable the network (i.e., the MAG and LMA) to deal with logical
   interface, instead to IP interfaces as current RFC5213 does.  RFC5213
   assumes that each physical interface capable of attaching to a MAG is
   an IP interface, while the logical interface solution groups several
   physical interfaces under the same IP logical interface.

   It is therefore clear that the Logical Interface approach satisfies

4.  Technology Use cases

   The 3GPP has defined the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) for heterogeneous
   wireless access.  A mobile device equipped with 3GPP and non-3GPP
   wireless technologies can simultaneously or sequentially connect any
   of the available devices and receive IP services through any of them.
   This document focuses on the simultaneous/sequential use of these
   technologies and on the use cases that derive.

   As mentioned in the previous sections the Logical Interface construct
   is required to hide the specifics of each technology in the context
   of network based mobility (e.g. in PMIPv6 deployments).  The LIF
   concept can be used with at least the following technologies: 3GPP
   access technologies (3G, LTE), WIMAX access technology and IEEE
   802.11 access technology.

   3GPP  In most OS implementations the connection setup establishes a
      PPP interface through the IPCP and IPv6CP protocol [RFC5072].  In
      this case the PPP interface does not have any L2 address assigned
      and does not generate any ARP or ND message for layer two address
      resolution.  Conversely recent implementations configure an
      ethernet alike interface at OS level hiding to the upper layers
      the PPP nature of the connection.  It has been verified (Android
      platform) that in these cases the ethernet alike interface
      configures a random L2 MAC address and uses this address as source
      link layer address option carried in the ND messages.  ARP is also
      run between the mobile device and the remote peer (the network is
      a /30 address space).

   WIMAX  In WiMAX system also, the connection between the mobile
      station (MS) and the access router (AR) is a point-to-point link.
      The MS auto configures an address based on the prefix advertised
      by the AR or is assigned an address via DHCPv6.  The stateless
      address auto-configuration is performed as per [RFC4861] and the
      IPv6 address is formed by adding an IID to the prefix learnt from
      Router Advertisement.  IPv6 packets sent or received by the MS are
      identified by specific IDs, by which the AR can map them to the
      corresponding tunnel in the network.

5.  Logical Interface Functional Details

   This section identifies the functional details of a logical interface
   and provides some implementation considerations.

   On most operating systems, a network interface is associated with a
   physical device that offers the services for transmitting and
   receiving IP packets to the applications on the host.  In some
   configurations, a network interface can also be implemented as a
   logical interface which does not have the inherent capability to
   transmit, or receive packets on a physical medium, but relies on
   other physical interfaces for such services.  Example of such
   configuration is an IP tunnel interface.

   General overview of a logical interface is shown in Figure 3.  The
   logical interface allows heterogeneous attachment while leaving the
   change in the media transparent to the IP stack.  Simultaneous and
   sequential network attachment procedures are possible enabling inter-
   technology and flow mobility scenarios.

              Figure 3: General overview of logical interface

   From the perspective of the IP stack and the applications, a Logical
   interface is just another interface.  In fact, the logical interface
   is only visible to the IP and upper layers when enabled.  A host does
   not see any operational difference between a Logical and a physical
   interface.  As with physical interfaces, a Logical interface is
   represented as a software object to which IP address configuration is
   bound.  However, the Logical interface has some special properties
   which are essential for enabling inter-technology handover and flow-
   mobility features.  Following are those properties:

Internet-Draft          Logical Interface Support           October 2012


   1.  The logical interface has a relation to a set of physical
       interfaces (sub-interfaces) on the host that it is abstracting.
       These sub-interfaces can be attached or detached from the Logical
       Interface at any time.  The sub-interfaces attached to a Logical
       interface are not visible to the IP and upper layers.

   2.  The logical Interface may either use a virtual interface
       identifier independent of the interface identifiers of its sub-
       interfaces, or it may use the link-layer identifier from one of
       its sub-interfaces.

   3.  The logical interface has the path awareness with respect to the
       attached IP networks.  For example, the logical interface may be
       bound to two IP networks, CAFE::/64 and BABA::/64, each of these
       prefixes may have been hosted on access networks attached through
       different sub-interfaces, WLAN and LTE.  The logical interface
       has the path awareness with respect to IP network to sub-
       interface mapping.

   4.  The logical interface may be attached to multiple access
       technologies with different link MTU values.  The adopted MTU
       value for the logical interface must be lowest MTU value across
       those access technologies.

   5.  The Transmit/Receive functions of the logical interface are
       mapped to the Transmit/Receive services exposed by the sub-
       interfaces.  This mapping is dynamic and any change is not
       visible to the upper layers of the IP stack.

   6.  The logical interface adapts to the point-to-point link model.

   7.  The logical interface maintains IP flow information for each of
       its sub-interfaces.  A conceptual data structure is maintained
       for this purpose.  The host may populate this information based
       on tracking each of the sub-interface for the active flows.

5.1.  Configuration of a Logical Interface

   A host may be statically configured with the logical interface
   configuration, or an application such as a connection manager on the
   host may dynamically create it.  Furthermore, the set of sub-
   interfaces that are part of a logical interface construct may be a
   fixed set, or may be kept dynamic, with the sub-interfaces getting
   added or deleted as needed.  The specific details related to these
   configuration aspects are implementation specific and is outside the
   scope of this document.

Internet-Draft          Logical Interface Support           October 2012


5.2.  MTU considerations for a Logical Interface

   The link MTU (maximum transmission unit) value configured on a
   logical interface should be the lowest of the MTU values supported
   across any of the physical interfaces that are part of that logical
   interface construct.  The MTU value should be configured as part of
   the logical interface creation on the host.

   Furthermore, this value must be updated any time there is a change to
   the logical interface construct, such as when interfaces are added or
   deleted from the logical interface setup.  Any time there is an
   inter-technology handover between two access technologies, the
   applications on the host bound to the IP address configuration on the
   logical interface will not detect the change and will continue to use
   the MTU value of the logical interface for the outbound packets,
   which is never greater than the MTU value on that supported access
   network.  However, the access network may continue to deliver the
   packets conforming to the MTU value supported on that access
   technology and the logical interface should be able to receive those
   packets from the physical interface attached to that network.  This
   approach of MTU configuration will ensure there is no IP packet
   fragmentation after inter-technology handovers.

5.3.  Supported Link models for a logical interface

   As per the base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC5213] the media
   underneath the physical interface has to be bound to a point-to-point
   link [RFC5213].  Access technologies that provides a shared media
   (e.g., IEEE 802.11) can be supported as long as they provide a point-
   to-point link [RFC4861].  The details of how a shared media provides
   a point to point link are link layer specific and/or operational
   matters that are out of scope of this document.  For example IEEE
   802.11 media can provide a point-to-point link via the appropriate
   use of IEEE 802.1Q VLAN header where a distinct VLAN is configured
   between the MAG and each of the mobile node, or by the approach of
   MAG transmitting multicast packets as layer-2 unicast packets
   [RFC6085] and thereby preserving the point-to-point link properties
   on a shared link.

5.4.  Link-layer Identifier Selection for a Logical Interface

   The logical Interface may be configured to use the link-layer
   identifier from one of its sub-interfaces, or an identifier
   independent of the link-layer identifiers of the sub-interfaces.
   Following are the considerations.

Internet-Draft          Logical Interface Support           October 2012


   o  In access architectures where it is possible to adopt a virtual
      link-layer identifier and use it for layer-2 communications in any
      of the access networks, a virtual identifier (VLL-Id) may be used.
      The specifics on how that identifier is chosen is out side the
      scope of this document.  This identifier may be used for all link-
      layer communications.  This identifier may also be used as the
      interface identifier when generating IPv6 global or link-local
      addresses, based on Stateless Autoconfiguration [RFC4862]

   o  In access architectures, where the link-layer identifier is
      associated with a specific access technology, it will not be
      possible for the logical interface to adopt a virtual identifier
      and it use it across different access networks.  In such networks,
      the logical interface must use the identifier of the respective
      sub-interface through which a packet is being transmitted.
      However, if more than one access technology domains that are part
      of the logical interface have such requirement, then the logical
      interface will not be able to support such configuration.

5.5.  ND Considerations for Logical Interface

   The following are the considerations related to supporting Neighbor
   Discovery [RFC4861] on a logical interface.

   o  Any Neighbor Discovery messages, such as Router Solicitation,
      Neighbor Solicitation Neighbor Advertisement messages that the
      host sends to a multicast destination address of link-local scope
      such as, all-nodes, all-routers, solicited-node multicast group
      addresses, using either an unspecified (::) source address, or a
      link-local address configured on the logical interface will be
      replicated and forwarded on each of the sub-interfaces under that
      logical interface.  However, if the destination address is a
      unicast address and if that target is known to exist on a specific
      sub-interface, the packet will be forwarded only on that specific
      sub-interface and will not be replicated on all sub-interfaces.

   o  Any Neighbor Discovery messages, such as Router Advertisement,
      that the host receives from any of its sub-interfaces part of the
      logical interface, will be associated with the logical interface,
      i.e., in some implementations the packet will appear on the input
      interface of the logical interface.

   o  When using Stateless Address Autoconfiguraion [RFC4862] for
      generating IPv6 address configuration on the logical interface,
      the host may use any of the IPv6 prefixes received from the Router
      Advertisement messages that it received from any of its sub-
      interfaces.

Internet-Draft          Logical Interface Support           October 2012


   o  The response to a Neighbor Discovery message received for a
      unicast, link-specific multicast group address, will be sent on
      the same sub-interface path where the packet was received.

   o  When using DHCPv4 [RFC2131] for obtaining address configuration
      for the logical interface, the value in the chaddr field in the
      DHCP messages will be based on the link-layer identifier scheme
      chosen by the logical interface.

5.6.  Provisioning Domain Considerations

   The considerations related to the support of multiple provisioning
   domains in a multi-interface host is documented in [RFC6418].  These
   considerations specifically focus on the aspects related to DNS
   configuration.  However, from the perspective of logical interface
   support, these considerations are not applicable, as the logical
   interface support is relevant only for a single provisioning domain.
   The key motivation for logical interface support is inter-technology
   handovers and the handovers are always in the context of a single
   provisioning domain.

5.7.  Logical Interface Forwarding Conceptual Data Structures

   The logical interface maintains the list of sub-interfaces that are
   part of the logical interface.  This conceptual data strucure is
   called as the LIF Table.  The logical interface also maintains the
   list of flows associated with a given sub-interface and this
   conceptual data structure is called as the PIF Table.  Both of these
   data structures have to be associated with a logical interface, and
   are depicted in Figure 4


      LIF TABLE                           FLOW table
    +===============================+   +=============================+
    | PIF_ID | FLOW RoutingPolicies |   | FLOW ID | Physical_Intf_Id  |

    |        | Status               |
    +-------------------------------+
    | ....   | ....                 |

                                 Figure 4

   The LIF table maintains the mapping between the LIF and each PIF
   associated to the LIF (refer to property #3, Figure 3).  For each PIF
   entry the table should store the associated Routing Policies, the
   Home Network Prefix received in Router Advertisement, the configured
   link layer Address (as described above) and the Status of the PIF
   (e.g. active, not active).  The method by which the Routing Policies
   are configured on the host is out of scope for this document.

   The FLOW table allows the logical interface to properly route each IP
   flow over the right interface.  The logical interface can identify
   the flows arriving on its sub-interfaces and associate them to those
   sub-interfaces.  This approach is similar to reflective QoS performed
   by the IP routers.  For locally generated traffic (e.g. unicast
   flows), the logical interface should perform interface selection
   based on the Flow Routing Policies.  In case traffic of an existing
   flow is suddenly received from the network on a different sub-
   interface than the one locally stored, the logical interface should
   interpret the event as an explicit flow mobility trigger from the
   network and it should update the PIF_ID parameter in the FLOW table.
   Similarly, locally generated events from the sub-interfaces, or
   configuration updates to the local policy rules can cause updates to
   the table and hence trigger flow mobility.

6.  Logical Interface Use-cases in Proxy Mobile IPv6

   This section explains how the Logical interface support on the mobile
   node can be used for enabling some of the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol
   features.

6.1.  Multihoming Support

   A mobile node with multiple interfaces can attach simultaneously to
   the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  Each of the attachment links are
   assigned a unique set of IPv6 prefixes.  If the host is configured to
   use Logical interface over the physical interface through which it is
   attached, following are the related considerations.

   o  The mobile node detects the advertised prefixes from the MAG1 and
      MAG2 as the on link prefixes on the link to which the Logical
      interface is attached.

   o  The mobile node can generate address configuration using stateless
      auto configuration mode from any of those prefixes.

   o  The applications can be bound to any of the addresses bound to the
      Logical interface and that is determined based on the source
      address selection rules.

   o  The host has path awareness for the hosted prefixes based on the
      received Router Advertisement messages.  Any packets with source
      address generated using HNP_1 will be routed through the interface
      if_1 and for packets using source address from HNP_2 will be
      routed through the interface if_2.

6.2.  Inter-Technology Handoff Support

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol enables a mobile node with multiple
   network interfaces to move between access technologies, but still
   retaining the same address configuration on its attached interface.
   The protocol enables a mobile node to achieve address continuity
   during handoffs.  If the host is configured to use Logical interface
   over the physical interface through which it is attached, following
   are the related considerations.

   o  When the mobile node performs an handoff between if_1 and if_2,

      node.  It will continue to receive Router Advertisements from the
      network, but from a different sub-interface path.

6.3.  Flow Mobility Support

   For supporting flow mobility support, there is a need to support
   vertical handoff scenarios such as transferring a subset of
   prefix(es) (hence the flows associated to it/them) from one interface
   to another.  The mobile node can support this scenario by using the
   Logical interface support.  This scenario is similar to the Inter-
   technology handoff scenario defined in Section 6.2, only a subset of
   the prefixes are moved between interfaces.

   Additionally, IP flow mobility in general initiates when the LMA
   decides to move a particular flow from its default path to a
   different one.  The LMA can decide on which is the best MAG that
   should be used to forward a particular flow when the flow is
   initiated e.g. based on application policy profiles) and/or during
   the lifetime of the flow upon receiving a network-based or a mobile-
   based trigger.

   As an example of mobile-based triggers, the LMA could receive input
   (e.g.by means of a layer 2.5 function via L3 signaling [RFC5677])
   from the MN detecting changes in the mobile wireless environment
   (e.g. weak radio signal, new network detected, etc.).  Upon receiving
   these triggers, the LMA can initiate the flow mobility procedures.
   For instance, when the mobile node only supports single-radio
   operation (i.e. one radio transmitting at a time), only sequential
   (i.e. not simultaneous) attachment to different MAGs over different
   media is possible.  In this case layer 2.5 signaling can be used to
   perform the inter-access technology handover and communicate to the
   LMA the desired target access technology, MN-ID, Flow-ID and prefix.
