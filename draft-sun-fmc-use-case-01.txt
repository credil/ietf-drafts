Internet-Draft                FMC use case                  October 2012


1.  Introduction

   In the FMC (Fixed Mobile Convergence) architecture, the major FMC
   could be devided into several aspects, which are the converged
   business and service, converged infrastructure and network, and
   converged user management.

   The fundamental principle of FMC all starts from the consumers.  With
   a multitude of devices to fit different personal preference, multi
   heterogeneous networks including fixed, 3GPP, WiFi, etc., and
   different business models in practice, people are getting more and
   more confused on how to make the decision to choose their
   subscriber-id, access network, etc.

   The customer needs a life without barriers.  The converged business
   will provide the customer with a uniform policy and user experience.
   It can be seamlessly and intuitively accessible across all devices
   and all networks.  The converged network and infrastructure will
   reduce the CAPEX and OPEX for operators, and incur minimal additional
   costs with the ever-changing business model.  The converged user
   management and terminals will offer a more simple and convenient user
   experience, which will deliver broadband connectivity and
   standardized multimedia services to a wide range of devices,
   including media servers, video cameras, portable media players, PCs
   and mobile phones.

   While BBF and 3GPP has done a lot of work on architecture model,
   interface definition, etc., protocol standardization work should
   still be undertaken in IETF which is acceptable to all parties and
   cultivates a common ecosystem based on Internet protocol
   architecture.

   The purpose of this document is provides the use cases in FMC
   ecosystem, together with some technical requirements and problems
   which need be resolved in IETF process.  Some issues have been taken
   by some existing WGs in IETF, and some can be applied but not
   specific to FMC scenario.  Our purpose can be regarded as a
   motivation to encouraging those working items to be standardized in
   IETF.


2.  Use case 1: Unified User Identification

   Consider a device of the subscriber accessing a network has to be
   authorised and authenticated as well as to assure reliability of the
   service,the device must be able to identified and recognized as the
   first step.  That means that the identity of the device must be
   transferred and acknowledged.  In addition, a unique identity has to

   be transferred or assigned to the device to maintian the device
   management.

   In real network,ISP assign a subscriber-id to the subscriber always.
   One subscriber may have multiple devices, including PC, mobile
   phones, ipad, etc., and may seamlessly cross multiple heterogeneous
   networks.  The subscriber can not only use this subscriber-id to
   access the network, but also share the subscription between multiple
   devices.  ISP could assign an ID to the customer, any of the devices
   belonging to the customer can achieve the authentication progress.
   The cumtomer can use this subcriber-id to connect the same service
   applications (operator's service or third-party service) without
   additional appliance.  The devices of the same subscriber should be
   managed in a group.  This group could be identified by a
   identification.With this unified identication, the customer can log
   in different application systems with a single access control.
   Besides, operators and content providers can apply the unified access
   policy, accounting policy, etc., to the customer for the specific set
   of devices, as illustrated in Figure 1 below.
                             Subscriber A have three
                                             device, X, Y, Z

   Potencial Technical Issues:

   The Device Identifier, such as ISIM, MAC address, IP address etc, is
   used to indicate each individual device or host for the customer.
   Currently, IP address can be regarded as a device Identifier from the
   network layer.  However, these identifiers are difficult to be kept
   consistently with NAT/CGNs(Carrier Grade Network Address Translation)
   along the path.  Addional techniques (e.g.  Host_ID, ID/Locator
   split, Device ID mapping to the network information,etc.)should be
   introduced to guarantee that a unique device Identifier will not be
   modified heterogeneous network environment.

   Additionally, there is no suitable certain identifier by means of
   group the customer's devices for unified control and management. .
   The group identifier for the devices should be introduced.  Based on
   this kind of identifier, the operator can provide unified policy
   control on the user-level, irrespective of the devices .It provides a
   business case with unified subscriber management, policy control,
   single sign-on for applications, etc.


3.  Use case 2: Unified QoS provisioning capability

   A customer was firstly watching TV with a smart phone on his way
   home, and the video stream is smooth.  When he arrives home, he
   switches the same TV channel to the television screen and keep
   watching.  This user experience should not decrease due to the
   handover between different devices, the QoS feature should remain
   consistent with customers' profile all the time, as illustrated in
   Figure 2 below.

                                 Figure 2

   In this scenario, different devices will have the special requirement
   on display resolution, codec, etc.  Addtionally, different networks
   will also have alternative ways to achieve these
   requirements.Moreover, content providers may provide differentiated
   service for subscribers.  When a customer roams from one network to
   another, or from one device or another, the user QoS priority should
   still be treated uniformly in Content Provider/ Service Provider
   (CP/SP), including bandwidth guarantee, Content Distribution Network
   (CDN) policy, etc.

   Potential Technical Issues:

   1.  QoS mapping: Unified user experience can only be achieved when
       heterogeneous networks interpret QoS parameters uniformly, which
       is based on the identification of the user.

   2.  User identification: CP/SP should support to identify the
       subscribers across different devices and heterogenous network.


4.  Use case 3: Seamless handover for VPDN tunnel

   A virtual private dial-up network (VPDN) is a network that extends
   remote access to a private network using a shared infrastructure,



Xie & Sun                Expires April 25, 2013                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                FMC use case                  October 2012


   VPDN allows individual users to connect to a remote network such as
   roaming sales people connecting to their company's intranet.  VPDNs
   use Layer 2 tunnel technologies (L2F, L2TP, and PPTP) to extend the
   Layer 2 and higher parts of the network connection from a remote user
   across an ISP network to a private network.  Sometimes, in order to
   ensure the confidentiality of the data sent to an remote user, IPsec
   is used to setup a secure tunnel from the VPDN Client to a central
   router.  However, when the user roams from one access point to
   another one,the network needs to provide a seamless remote access
   during handover.

   Potential Technical Issues:

   The issues that should be tackled in this case include device feature
   identification, seamless handover between different secure
   tunnels,Qos mapping, etc.  Currently, a possible solution is Mobike
   [RFC4555], which allows the IP addresses of the tunnel endpoints in
   IPsec tunnel mode to change.  However, this solution has a "NAT
   prohibition" feature which can be used to ensure that IP addresses
   have not been modified by NATs, IPv4/IPv6 translation agents, or
   other similar devices.  Besides, other kinds of VPDN should also be
   solved in seamless handover case.


5.  Use case 4: Mobility

   Mobility is one of the most important items which should be
   considered in FMC work.  We introduce two mobility usecases here, one
   is mobility between different access technologies (WiFi and 3GPP),
   and the other is mobility in WiFi scenario, such as between APs, as
   illustrated in Figure 3 below.

                                 Figure 3

   Customer service should be guaranteed during the switch between one
   access network to another.  For example, customer's call or video
   service shouldn't be interrupted when moving from 3GPP access to WiFi
   access techonology.  Even more we can see all the services depends on
   the substantive of customer's profile.  Move, in the NAT scenario, we
   need identification for UE behind NAT.  It is important to confirm
   the device identification binding or updated accordingly for the same
   UE which is moving.  It isn't in the scope of mobility protocol.

   Additionally, WiFi is one of the most important access technology for
   operators, it is possible that customer is playing video in the bus
   via WiFi.  The mobility between APs,and in AP overlap area must be
   considered.  Even more, wherever the device access to the service via
   WiFi, such as at home or in the hotspot, or even roaming to another
   WiFi operator's network, the QoS and service experience should be
   uniform.

   Potential Technical Issues:

   1.  In order to provide uniform policy control, the device
       identification should be uniform or transferred during the device
       mobility.  This is the specical requirement for UE identifier.

   2.  When the service application from one device to another deivce of
       a subscriber, the uniform QoS and service experience should be
       guaranteed, even between different access networks.  Based on
       this requirement, PMIP and MIP can not achieve the QoS uniform
       during mobility.  Additional mechine is needed.

   3.  In the scenario of WiFi, the service QoS and experience between
       different APs should be guanrantted during device mobility.  In
       this case, the WiFi connection status and the subscriber
       information should be tracked during mobility.
