    <abstract>
    <t>DNSSEC provides data integrity and authentication for DNSSEC validators. However, without valid trust anchor(s) and an acceptable value for the current time, DNSSEC validation cannot be performed. As a result, there are multiple cases where DNSSEC validation MUST NOT be performed. In addition, this list of exceptions is expected to become larger over time.</t>

<t>Considering an increasing number of cases where DNSSEC is disabled adds complexity to the DNSSEC validator implementations and increases the vectors that disable security.</t>

    <t>This document assumes that DNSSEC adoption by end devices requires that end devices MUST be able to support a DNSSEC validation always set. This MUST be valid today as well as in the future.</t> 

    <t> This document describes DHCP Options to provision the DHCP Client with valid trust anchors and time so DNSSEC validation can be performed.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Introduction">

    <t>DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"/>, <xref target="RFC4034"/>, <xref target="RFC4035"/> adds data authentication and integrity checks to DNS <xref target="RFC1034"/>, <xref target="RFC1035"/>. For signature validation, DNSSEC requires a trust anchor such as the Key Signing Key (KSK) of the Root Zone or any other zone. Without a trust anchor, DNSSEC validation cannot be performed. In addition KSKs and signatures are valid for a given period of time. As a result, DNSSEC validation cannot be performed if time shifting is to large.</t>

    <t>This document considers DHCP DNSSEC Trust Anchor Option and DHCP Time Option to provision a device with trusted KSKs and current time. Although our priority is to provide the Root Zone KSK, we also consider the case other trusted KSK MAY be provided, for example, if a Zone does not provide secure delegation, or to mitigate badly configured DNSSEC zones (like TLDs zones).</t>

    <t>The main motivation for these DHCP Options is that DHCP enabled devices have DNSSEC validation always set and do not need to perform DNS resolution without DNSSEC validation. In fact, enabling DNS with no validation represents a potential way to remove security and MAY be used by attackers. Similarly, DNSSEC configuration implemented in the end users device, MAY not consider future cases and MAY introduce vulnerabilities. DHCP Options prevent this as long as the relationship between DHCP Client and DHCP Server is trusted.</t>

    <t>This document assumes that the channel between the DHCP Client and the DHCP Server is trusted and secured with DHCP mechanisms described in <xref target="RFC3315"/>, or IPsec <xref target="RFC4301"/>.</t>
 
    </section>

    <section title="Threat Model">

    <t>This document addresses the case of a device configured with DNSSEC validation set that is plugged in, gets connectivity (using DHCP for example), but fails DNSSEC resolutions because its trust anchor KSK is not valid anymore or its local time is not valid.</t>

    <t>This threat mainly addresses devices that can be switched off for a long period of time or devices that MAY be off-shelves for a long time before being plugged in. CPEs as well as any homenet devices are concerned by this use case.</t>

    <t>This threat also addresses DNSSEC emergency key roll over operations. Devices that have cached the out-of-date KSK will not be able to check the signatures until the TTL has expired on all caches.</t>

   <t>This document proposes DHCP Options that provide the necessary parameters to perform DNSSEC validation. These Options MUST be used on a trusted network over a trusted channel between the DHCP Client and the DHCP Server. These options MAY be used in conjunction of additional mechanisms.</t>

    <section title="Motivations for providing DNSSEC Trust Anchor">

    <t>The first motivation for providing trusted KSKs is to provide automatic configuration of devices to enable DNSSEC validation. This avoids validator initial KSK provisioning issue as well as KSK roll over issues.</t>

    <t>A validator MAY not be able to perform signature check with an authenticated KSK because:
    <list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
        <t hangText="- 1)">It does not have a trust anchor (like the Root Zone KSK)</t>
        <t hangText="- 2)">The KSK MAY have been authenticated, stored or cached with an expiration date valid but is not valid anymore. This MAY happen in the case of an emergency key roll over, if the device has been offline during the key roll over, or if the key roll over is not performed as described in <xref target="DPS-KSK"/>, <xref target="RFC5011"/>.</t>
        <t hangText="- 3)">The chain of trust MAY have been broken. This can happen to non Root Zone KSK only and MAY not involve the responsibility of the owner of the zone. The deeper the Zone is in the hierarchy, the more likely this happens.</t>
        <t hangText="- 4)">A DNSSEC zone MAY have been badly signed or a KSK MAY have been badly generated. The DNSSEC MAY be correct, but DNSSEC validator MAY keep for a long time the badly generated KSK, ZSK...</t>
    </list>
    </t>

    <t>The goal of the DHCP DNSSEC Trust Anchor Option is to provide these validators trusted anchors like the Root Zone KSK, as well as other KSKs (TLDs...) so the validator has the proper KSKs to perform DNSSEC validation.</t>

   <t>Most documents are currently focused on the Root Zone KSK for which recommendations and alternative mechanisms have been described. <xref target="I-D.jabley-dnsop-validator-bootstrap"/> provides guide lines on how to retrieve and select DNSSEC Trust Anchors. Section 5.3 and <xref target="I-D.jabley-dnssec-trust-anchor"/> describes mechanisms to retrieve securely the Root Zone KSK relying on TLS security. It suggests to use insecure DNS resolution to set HTTPS connections. Using HTTPS requires downloading the keyDigest id (key-label) from https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml, followed by an HTTPS request at https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/key-label.crt to get the whole certificate.</t>

    <t>The key advantages of the DHCP DNSSEC Trust Anchor Option described in this document are that we extend the mechanism to any KSK, and validators can set DNSSEC validation for all DNS queries. However, we do not see any contradiction between recommendations provided by <xref target="I-D.jabley-dnsop-validator-bootstrap"/> and <xref target="I-D.jabley-dnssec-trust-anchor"/> and believe the principle described in these documents SHOULD be applied by the validators. Note also that DHCP DNSSEC Trust Anchor Option only benefits to validators that are configured via DHCP.</t>

   <t>To recover from a DNSSEC failure and remove a particular data from cache, <xref target="I-D.jabley-dnsop-dns-flush"/> suggests to use a NOTIFY message between Authoritative Servers and Resolvers. This mechanism is set between Recursive Server and Authoritative Servers with a specific trusted relationship. This is probably a selection of TLDs. This document, does not address the DNSSEC failure over Recursive Servers, but addresses more specifically DHCP configured devices. These are typically CPEs or End Users. We believe that configuring and restarting DNSSEC validators with DHCP Option, is an easier way to cope with this issue. First the trust relation between DHCP Server already exists, we do not need additional trusted channel between Authoritative Servers or eventually the Recursive Servers. Then basic implementations of stub resolvers, in CPE or desktops may not address NOTIFY message.</t>  

    </section>

    
    <section title="Motivations for providing Time">
      
    <t>KSKs and signatures are always associated to an expiration time. As a result, DNSSEC validation requires that the validator knows the current time.</t>

    <t>A number of mechanisms exists like <xref target="TLSDATE"/> or <xref target="RFC5905"/> for setting the time of the device. In addition, <xref target="RFC5908"/> provides a Network Time Protocol (NTP) Server Option for DHCP. The DHCP Time Option described in this document differs from <xref target="RFC5908"/> as it provides an estimation of the current time, instead of providing the NTP servers location information. The time value provided by the DHCP Time Option should be used only if previously mentioned mechanisms are either not implemented on the device or are unavailable. One of the reason MAY be that you MAY need valid DNS(SEC) resolution to use these protocols. The time provided by the DHCP Time Option does not have the accuracy of NTP and SHOULD be considered as a best effort value. <xref target="I-D.jabley-dnsop-validator-bootstrap"/> also recommends that when time has not been verified by the validator, the signature validation SHOULD be done with time off.</t>
 
    <t>The key advantage of the DHCP Time Option is that it makes possible to have DNSSEC validation always set. It limits the possible DNSSEC validation variants which potentially expose the device to disable DNSSEC validations. Note also that DHCP Time Option only benefits to validators that are configured via DHCP.</t>

This data is not integrity protected, nor it can be authenticated. Such data SHOULD be trusted over a trusted DHCP channel.</t>
            <t hangText="- DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Options:"> Carries a certificate encoded as described in <xref target="RFC4398"/>. The advantage of the Certificate is that is enables authentication of the received information by a trusted party. For example, CPE providers MAY provide a trusted certification authority.

        <section title="DHCP DNSSEC KSK RR Trust Anchor Options">

        <t>The DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option provides the RRset as mentioned in the DNS(SEC) Zone. In other words, it carries the RR as defined in Section 3.2. of <xref target="RFC1035"/> and a RDATA DNSKEY as defined in Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC4033"/>. As the RR has a variable length, the DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Options follows the recommendation format of Section 5.9 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines"/>.</t>

    <section title="DHCP Client Behavior">
   
    <t>DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option, DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option or DHCP Time Option described in this document are intended for DNSSEC validation. If a connected device is not performing DNSSEC validation, it MUST NOT send a DHCP an Option Request DHCP Option (ORO) <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> for any of these options, and MUST ignore all these options if provided by the DHCP Server.</t>

    <t>The DHCP sends a DHCP ORO for one or multiple options described in the document. Motivations for sending this Option Request DHCP Option is out of scope of the document. It could be a device switched off for a long time, a device that cannot validate the DNSSEC responses.</t>

    <t>A channel is considered trusted if 1) the DHCP Server is trusted and authenticated and 2) exchanged data between the DHCP Client and the DHCP Server is integrity protected. IPsec <xref target="RFC4301"/>, for example, MAY be used to establish a secure channel. </t>

   <t>Over a trusted channel, the DHCP Client that performs DNSSEC validation MAY send an ORO for any of the DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option, the DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option or the DHCP Time Option to a DHCP Server.</t>

    <t>Over a trusted channel, the DHCP Client that performs DNSSEC validation SHOULD consider the DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option, the DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option or the DHCP Time Option sent  by the DHCP Server.</t>

    <t>Over a non trusted channel, the DHCP Client MAY only send ORO for a DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option. This option is the only one that MAY be considered by the DHCP Client if sent by the DHCP Server. If the DHCP Client does not trust the signer of the certificate, the option MUST be ignored.</t>

    <t>When a DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option or a DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option is accepted by the DHCP Client, it MUST remove overwrite old values for the KSK with the new one.</t>

    <t>When a DHCP Time Option is accepted by the DHCP Client, it MUST check the difference between its clock and the time provided by the Option. It SHOULD overwrite its clock value only if the difference is too large.</t>

    <t>In any other case, ORO requests MUST NOT be sent by the DHCP Client, and options received by the DHCP Server MUST NOT be considered by the DHCP Client. The remaining of the section details when the options MUST NOT be requested by the DHCP Client and MUST be ignored by the DHCP Client when received by the DHCP Server.</t>  


    <t>The DHCP Client MUST NOT send an ORO for a DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option, a DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option or a DHCP Time Option to a DHCP Server that is either not trusted or not authenticated.</t>

    <t>All DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option, a DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option or a DHCP Time Option received from DHCP Server that is not authenticated or that is not trusted MUST be ignored by the DHCP Client.</t>

    <t>The DHCP Client MUST NOT send an ORO for a DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option or a DHCP Time Option to a trusted DHCP Server over an untrusted channel. A DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option MAY be requested over an untrusted channel since the certificate is signed and thus can be authenticated. A DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option signed by an untrusted authority MUST be ignored by the DHCP Client.</t>

    <t>All DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option or a DHCP Time Option received from DHCP Server over a channel that is not trusted MUST be ignored by the DHCP Client.</t>
    </section> 

    <section title="DHCP Server Behavior">

    <t>The DHCP Server SHOULD properly answer with the requested options in the ORO, even if the DHCP Server does not consider the channel with DHCP Client as trusted.</t>

    <t>The DHCP Server MAY also provide DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option, DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option or DHCP Time Option without being requested by the DHCP Client. This could for example prevent failures not detected by the DHCP Client.</t>
