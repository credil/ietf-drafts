Internet-Draft               G.Bond/TDIM MIB                  March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Multi-pair bonding using time-division inverse multiplexing
   (TDIM), a.k.a.  G.Bond/TDIM, is specified in ITU-T G.998.3
   recommendation [G.998.3], which defines a method for bonding (or
   aggregating) of multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer channels in
   multiple xDSL lines) into a single bi-directional logical link,
   carrying a mix of various traffic streams, e.g.  Ethernet,
   Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM).

   The MIB module, defined in this document, provides G.Bond/
   TDIM-specific objects for the management of G.998.3 bonded
   interfaces, extending the common bonding objects specified in GBOND-
   MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] module.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The Broadband Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding

   This document makes use of the Broadband Forum technical report
   Management Framework for xDSL Bonding [TR-159], defining a management
   model and a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded xDSL
   interfaces.

4.  Relationship to other MIB modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB) and G.Bond MIB (GBOND-MIB).

Internet-Draft               G.Bond/TDIM MIB                  March 2012


4.1.  Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB module

   A G.Bond/TDIM port is a private case of a Bonded multi-pair xDSL
   interface and as such is managed using generic interface management
   objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].  In particular an interface
   index (ifIndex) is used to index instances of G.Bond/TDIM ports, as
   well as xDSL lines/channels, in a managed system.

4.2.  Relationship to G.Bond MIB module

   GBOND-MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] module defines management
   objects common for all Bonded multi-pair xDSL interfaces.  In
   particular it describes the bonding management, bonded port and
   channel configuration, initialization sequence etc.

   Both GBOND-MIB and G9983-MIB modules are REQUIRED to manage a G.Bond/
   TDIM port.

5.  MIB Structure

5.1.  Overview

   All management objects defined in the G9983-MIB module are contained
   in a single group g9983Port.  This group is further split into 6 sub-
   groups, structured as recommended by RFC 4181 [RFC4181]:

   o  g9983PortNotifications - containing notifications (TDIM Service
      Down/Up).

   o  g9983PortConfTable - containing objects for configuration of a
      G.Bond/TDIM port.

   o  g9983PortCapTable - containing objects reflecting capability of a
      G.Bond/TDIM port.

   o  g9983PortStatTable - containing objects providing overall status
      information of a G.Bond/TDIM port, complementing the generic
      status information from the ifTable of IF-MIB and
      gBondPortStatFltStatus of GBOND-MIB.

   o  g9983SvcTable - containing objects for configuration and status of
      the services in a G.Bond/TDIM port.

   o  g9983PM - containing objects for an OPTIONAL Historical
      Performance Monitoring (PM) of a G.Bond/TDIM port.

5.2.  Link Protection Configuration

   G.Bond/TDIM specification allows an optional Forward Error Correction
   (FEC) and Interleaver block, which, if supported and enabled,
   provides a degree of protection against micro-interruptions, alien
   noise, and even individual Bonding Channel Entity (BCE) failures,
   a.k.a. cut-line protection.

   Management objects in the g9983PortConfTable can be used to configure
   and query the FEC and Interleaver function of the G.Bond/TDIM port.

5.3.  Service Configuration

   Unlike the other two xDSL Multi-Pair Bonding schemes (G.Bond/ATM and
   G.Bond/Ethernet), which send the information required for reassembly
   of the fragmented data along with the data, G.Bond/TDIM is a
   synchronous scheme, requiring both ends to know the data distribution
   tables before any actual data transfer can happen.

   Management objects in the g9983PortConfTable
   (g9983PortConfAdminServices), g9983SvcTable and g9983OperSvcTable can
   be used to configure and query the configuration of services
   transported via the G.Bond/TDIM link.  The services may be configured
   independently of the link state (i.e. in- and out-of-service), as
   G.998.3 communicates changes in the service configuration via
   specific Bonding Communication Channel (BCC) messages, switching both
   ends of the link to the new configuration synchronously.

   There can be up to 60 active services defined on a G.Bond/TDIM link.
   This MIB module provides an ability to define up to 255 services via
   the g9983SvcTable, with each row representing a possible service, and
   then set the actual service configuration using the
   g9983PortConfAdminServices object (a byte-vector of service indices),
   listing the active services in the order of their position in the
   G.Bond/TDIM frame.  This design allows one to easily modify service
   drop priority, which directly corresponds to the service position.

   The actual list of services is provided via the read-only
   g9983OperSvcTable, where each entry's index corresponds to the
   service position, starting from index 1 for the first entry, 2 for
   the second entry etc., providing an easy service navigation for a
   management application using GET-NEXT (instead of counting bytes in
   the g9983PortConfAdminServices object).

   The service configuration can only be changed on a Bonding
   Transmission Unit at the Central Office (BTU-C).

   When configuring the services, please bear in mind that the sum of

   all the services' bandwidth SHOULD be less or equal to the target
   data rate of the bonded link.  Note that G.Bond/TDIM links are
   symmetrical, i.e. their upstream data rate equals to the downstream
   data rate.

5.3.1.  Management of TDM Services and service drop priority during
        bandwidth degradation

   G.Bond/TDIM protocol provides an ability to map TDM services into the
   TDIM bonded link directly, without any additional overhead.  It
   addresses only structure-agnostic TDM transport, disregarding any
   structure that may be imposed on these streams, in particular the
   structure imposed by the standard TDM framing [G.704].

   During bandwidth degradation services with a lower priority are
   impaired or dropped first.  Synchronous services (fractional DS1/E1,
   clear channel E1/T1, T3/E3, clock) positioned in the beginning of the
   G.Bond/TDIM frame, have higher priority than asynchronous services
   (Ethernet, ATM, GFP encapsulated), positioned farther away.  Within
   the services of the same type, those with lower position (index) have
   higher priority.

5.3.2.  Service Notifications

   This MIB module provides specific Up/Down notifications (g9983SvcUp/
   g9983SvcDown) for each of the configured services.  During bandwidth
   degradation a number of services may be suspended (dropped)
   simultaneously, according to their drop priority (position in the
   service list).  Please note that it is possible for a higher priority
   service to be dropped before a lower priority one.  For example,
   suppose there are two services configured on a 2 Mbps G.Bond/TDIM
   link: a T1 service (g9983SvcType with a value of ds1, with a
   bandwidth requirement of 1.5 Mbps) and an Ethernet service with a
   size of 0.5 Mbps.  When the actual link bandwidth is reduced to 1.4
   Mbps, the T1 service with a g9983OperSvcPosition value of 1 would be
   dropped, while the Ethernet service with a g9983PerSvcPosition value
   of 2 would remain up.

   Notifications SHOULD be rate-limited (throttled) such that there is
   an implementation-specific gap between the generation of consecutive
   notifications of the same event.  This mechanism prevents
   notification flooding in case g9983ServiceOperState oscillates
   between Up and Down states.  When notifications are rate-limited,
   they are dropped and not queued for sending at a future time.  This
   is intended to be a general rate-limiting statement for notifications
   that otherwise have no explicit rate-limiting assertions in this
   document.

5.4.  Performance Monitoring

   The OPTIONAL performance monitoring counters, thresholds and history
   buckets (interval-counters), similar to those defined in [TR-159] are
   implemented using the textual conventions defined in the HC-PerfHist-
   TC-MIB [RFC3705].  The HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB defines 64-bit versions of
   the textual conventions found in PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3593].

   The agent SHOULD align the beginning of each interval to a fifteen
   minute boundary of a wall clock.  Likewise, the beginning of each one
   day intervals SHOULD be aligned with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when a G.Bond TDIM port is reinitialized, but
   rather only when the agent is reset or reinitialized.

   Note that the accumulation of certain performance events for a
   monitored entity is inhibited (counting stops) during periods of
   service unavailability on that entity.  The DESCRIPTION clause of
   performance monitoring counters in this MIB module specifies which of
   the counters are inhibited during periods of service unavailability.

5.5.  Mapping of Broadband Forum TR-159 and ITU-T G.998.3 Managed
      Objects

   This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects
   (attributes) defined in [TR-159] and managed objects defined in this
   document.  Note that all management objects defined in [G.998.3] have
   corresponding objects in [TR-159].

                Table 1: Mapping of TR-159 Managed Objects

   Note that some of the mapping between the objects defined in TR-159
   and the ones defined in this MIB module is not one-to-one, for
   example, while TR-159 PM attributes aGroupPerf* map to the
   corresponding gBondPortPm* objects of the GBOND-MIB module, there are
   no dedicated PM attributes for the g9983PortPm* and g9983SvcPm*
   objects introduced in this MIB module.  However, since their
   definition is identical to the definition of gBondPortPm* objects of
   the GBOND-MIB module, we can map g9983PortPm* and g9983SvcPm* to the
   relevant aGroupPerf* attributes of TR-159 and use the term 'partial
   mapping' to denote the fact that this mapping is not one-to-one.

       the 1st service of highest priority.

       A zero-length octet string is object-specific and MUST
       therefore be defined as part of the description of any object
       that uses this syntax. Examples of the usage of a zero-length

       Clock, the value of this object MUST be 0.

       A GET operation returns current value.
       A SET operation, allowed on GBS-C ports, changes the service

7.  Security Considerations

   There is a number of managed objects defined in this MIB module with
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  Changing of g9983PortConfAdminServices object may lead to a
      potential service disruption, by changing a particular service'
      position (therefore changing its drop priority) or even removing
      the service from the link altogether.

   o  Changing of g9983SvcTable configuration parameters (e.g.
      g9983SvcType or g9983SvcSize) may lead to a potential service
      impairment, for example a TDM service would be dropped if there is
      not enough actual bandwidth on the bonded link to support this
      service.

   o  Changing of g9983PortConfTable configuration parameters (e.g.
      g9983PortConfFecAdminState) may lead to anything from link quality
      and rate degradation to a complete link initialization failure.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments since, collectively, they
   provide information about the performance of network interfaces and
   can reveal some aspects of their configuration.

   In particular, since a bonded xDSL port can be comprised of multiple
   Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) voice grade copper, located in the same
   bundle with other pairs belonging to another operator/customer, it is
   theoretically possible to eavesdrop to a G.Bond transmission, simply
   by "listening" to a cross-talk from the bonded pairs, especially if
   the operating parameters of the G.Bond link in question are known.

Internet-Draft               G.Bond/TDIM MIB                  March 2012


   It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to
   these objects and possibly even encrypt the values of these objects
   when sending them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables
   and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  g9983PortStatFecOperState in g9983PortStatTable indicate whether
      the FEC function is enabled, which may aid in deciphering of the
      G.Bond/TDIM transmissions.

   o  g9983OperSvcTable provide current operational service
      configuration, which may aid in deciphering of the G.Bond/TDIM
      transmissions.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), including full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   An object identifier for g9983MIB MODULE-IDENTITY SHALL be allocated
   by IANA [1] in the MIB-2 transmission sub-tree, before this document
   is published as an RFC.
