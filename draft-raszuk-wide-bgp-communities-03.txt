                     Wide BGP Communities Attribute
                  draft-raszuk-wide-bgp-communities-03

Abstract

   Route tagging plays an important role in external BGP [RFC4271]
   relations, in communicating various routing policies between peers.
   It is also a very common best practice among operators to propagate
   various additional information about routes intra-domain.  The most
   common tool used today to attach various information about routes is
   through the use of BGP communities [RFC1997].

   Such information is important to allow BGP speakers to perform some
   mutually agreed upon actions without the need to maintain a separate
   offline database for each tuple of prefix and associated set of
   action entries.

   This document defines a new encoding which will enhance and simplify
   what can be accomplished today with the use of BGP communities.  The
   most important addition this specification makes over currently
   defined BGP communities is the ability to specify, carry as well as
   use for execution an operator's defined set of parameters.  It also
   provides an extensible platform for any new community encoding needs
   in the future.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   RFC 1997 [RFC1997] defines the BGP Community Attribute.  This
   attribute is used as a tool to carry additional information in BGP
   routes which may help to automate peering administration.  The BGP
   Communities Attribute consists of one or more sets of four octet
   values, where each specifies a different community.  Except for two
   reserved ranges, the encoding of community values mandates that the
   first two octets are to contain the Autonomous System number, with
   the next two octets containing some locally defined value.

   With the introduction of 4-octet Autonomous System numbers by RFC
   4893 [RFC4893] it became obvious that BGP Communities as specified in
   RFC 1997 will not be able to accommodate new AS encoding.  In fact
   RFC 4893 explicitly recommends use of four octets AS specific
   [RFC5668] extended communities [RFC4360] as a way to encode new 4
   octet AS numbers.

   While the encoding of 4 octet AS numbers is being addressed by
   [draft-ietf-idr-as4octet-extcomm-generic-subtype], neither the base
   BGP communities (standard or extended) nor as4octet-extcomm-generic
   document define a sufficient level of encoding freedom which could be
   of practical use.  The authors believe that defining a new BGP Path
   Attribute, with the ability to contain locally defined parameters
   will enhance the current level of network policies, as well as
   simplify BGP policy management.  The proposed simple encoding will
   also facilitate the delivery of new network services without a need
   to define a new BGP extension each time.

   When defining any new type of tool there is always a unique
   opportunity to specify a subset of well recognized behaviors.  Lists
   of the current most commonly used BGP communities, as well as
   provision for a new registry for future definitions will be contained
   in a separate document.


2.  Wide BGP Community Attribute

   This document defines a new BGP Path Attribute, the Wide BGP
   Community.  The attribute type code is (TBA by IANA).

   The Wide BGP Community Attribute is an optional, transitive BGP
   attribute, and may be present only once in the update message.

   The attribute contains a number of typed containers.  Any given
   container type may appear multiple times, unless that container
   type's definition specifies otherwise.

2.1.  Wide BGP Community Attribute Container Header

   Containers always start with the following header:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     |            Length             |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   +------+-------+----------------------------------------------------+
   |  Bit | Value | Meaning                                            |
   +------+-------+----------------------------------------------------+
   |   0  |   0   | Local community value.                             |
   |      |   1   | Registered community value.                        |
   |   1  |   0   | Do not decrement Hop Count field across            |
   |      |       | confederation boundaries.                          |
   |      |   1   | Decrement Hop Count field across confederation     |
   |      |       | boundaries.                                        |
   | 2..7 |   -   | SHOULD be zero.                                    |
   +------+-------+----------------------------------------------------+

   Flags are defined globally, to apply to all wide community container
                                  types.

                              Table 1: Flags

   Bit 0 set (value 1) indicates that the given container carries a Wide
   BGP Community which is registered with IANA.  When not set (value 0)
   it indicates that community value which follows is locally assigned
   with a local meaning.  Ignored bits SHOULD be preserved in any
   received containers, or set to 0 otherwise.

   Bit 1 is used to manage the propagation scope of a given Wide BGP
   Community across confederation boundaries.  When not set (value of
   0), the Hop Count field is not considered at the sub-AS boundaries.
   When set (value of 1), sub-AS border router follows the same
   procedure regarding the handling of the Hop Count field as applicable
   to ASBR at the domain boundary.

   The Hop Count field represents the forwarding radius, in units of AS
   hops, for the given Wide BGP Community.  A Hop Count value of zero
   indicates that this wide community must not cross any further AS
   boundaries.  At each AS boundary, when propagating a given wide
   community over an EBGP session, the Hop Count field MUST be

   decremented by the sending EBGP speaker.

   The exact same decrement procedures described above apply also to
   sub-confederation boundaries when the bit 1's flag is set to 1.

   The special value of 0xFF indicates that the enclosed community may
   always be propagated over an EBGP boundary.  A Hop Count value of
   0xFF MUST NOT be decremented during propagation.

   The length represents the total lengths of a given container in
   octets.

2.2.  Wide Community Atoms

   Wide BGP communities will act on and hence need to encode some
   distinct atoms of data.  These are encoded as Sub-TLVs, where each
   Sub-TLV has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |   Sub-Type    |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |            Length             |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                         Value (variable)                      |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Sub-Type field contains a value of 0-254.  The value 255 is
   reserved for future use.  The sub-TLV types are to be assigned and
   maintained by IANA registry.

   The length represents the total length of a given sub-TLV in octets.

   The value field contains the sub-TLV value.

   Supported format of the sub-TLVs can be:

   - Type 1:     4 octets : Autonomous System number
   - Type 2:  1..5 octets : IPv4 prefix (1 octet prefix length + prefix)
   - Type 3: 1..17 octets : IPv6 prefix (1 octet prefix length + prefix)
   - Type 4:     4 octets : Integer
   - Type 5:     variable : UTF-8 String
   - Type 6:     4 octets : IEEE Floating Point Number
   - Type 7:     variable : Grouping Container (for logical AND)
   - Type 8:     1  octet : Neighbor Class

   The semantics of a given atom will depend on the context it is used
   as defined by the containing wide community.

   For consistent treatment, all AS numbers MUST be encoded as 4 octet
   values.  When encoding two octet ASes, the first two octets of this
   four octet value MUST be filled with zeros.

   Two special values are reserved for the Autonomous System atom:

      0x00000000 - to indicate "No Autonomous Systems".

      0xFFFFFFFF - to indicate "All Autonomous Systems".

   The Grouping Container is intended for use for Wide Community
   Targets.  Targets typically have a "match any" behavior.  When a
   Grouping Container is present in a target, all contained atoms must
   match for the community to be applied.

   The Neighbor Class atom represents a classification of a BGP peering
   session.  This class currently can contain three values:

      1 - Peer: This class is typically applied to sessions where a
      transit-free relationship exists between two providers.

      2 - Customer: This class is typically applied to sessions where
      the remote end of the session is operated by a customer.

      3 - Upstream: This class is typically applied to sessions where
      the remote end of the session is operated by a network from which
      you receive transit routes.

3.  Container Type 1: Wide Community

   The Wide BGP Community Type 1 container is of variable size and is
   encoded as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

                    Figure 4: Wide BGP Community Type 1

3.1.  Community Value

   Community Value: 4 octets

      The Wide BGP Community value indicates what set of actions a
      router is requested to take upon reception of a route containing
      this community.  The semantics of this value depend on whether
      this is a private/local community or registered.

3.2.  Source AS Number

   Source Autonomous System Number: 4 octets

      The Autonomous System number which indicates the originator of
      this Wide BGP Community.

      When the Autonomous System is a two octet number the first two
      octets of this 4 octet value MUST be filled with zeros.

3.3.  Context AS Number

   Context Autonomous System Number: 4 octets

      The Autonomous System number that indicates the context of the
      Registered/Local Value.  When the value is a Registered Value (and
      thus registered with IANA), this field MUST be 0.

      When the wide community is locally registered, the Context
      Autonomous System Number indicates the AS that defines the format
      of this wide community for the given Local Value.  (In other
      words, value 1 will likely refer to different formats for AS 1 vs.
      AS 2.)

3.4.  Wide Community Target(s) TLV

   Type: 1

   The Wide Community Target(s) TLV has the same format as a Wide
   Community atom.

   Wide Community Targets define the matching criteria for the
   community.  A given wide community may have a number of targets that
   it applies to.  The semantics of these targets will vary on a per
   community basis.  Depending on the definition of the community,
   targets may be optional.

   The value field of the Wide Community Target(s) TLV is a series of
   Wide Community Atom TLVs.  The semantics of any given atom TLV MUST
   be part of the definition of a given Wide Community.

   Typically, Wide Community Targets consist of a series of atoms that
   have "match any" semantics.  Thus, if any given target matches per
   the semantics of that atom for the community, the community is
   considered to match and the action defined by the community should be
   executed.

   The Grouping Container atom permits a set of atoms with semantics
   defined by the community to be nested.  The Grouping Container atom
   is considered to be a matching target if, and only if, all of its
   contained atoms match per the semantics of the community.

   If the semantics of a given atom is undefined for the community in
   question, it MUST be ignored.  If an atom with undefined semantics is
   part of a Grouping Container, the entire container MUST be ignored.

   When no targets are required by the definition of a given Wide
   Community, the Wide Community Target TLV SHOULD NOT be encoded in the
   community.  Implementations MUST be prepared to accept a Wide
   Community Target TLV with an empty value field.

3.5.  Wide Community Parameter(s) TLV

   Type: 2

   The Wide Community Parameter(s) TLV has the same format as a Wide



Raszuk, et al.          Expires January 14, 2013                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft            wide-bgp-communities                 July 2012


   Community atom.

   A given wide community may have parameters which are used as inputs
   for executing actions defined for that community.  These parameters,
   and any constraints implied by the parameters, MUST be defined by the
   wide community definition.  Parameters consist of an ordered set of
   atom sub-TLVs.  The semantics of any specific positional instance of
   an atom MUST be defined by the wide community.

   If it is the case that a paramter for a given community is of an
   unexpected type, the community MUST be ignored.

   If it is the case that there are too many or two few parameters for a
   given community, the community MUST be ignored.

   When no parameters are required by the definition of a given Wide
   Community, the Wide Community Paramters TLV SHOULD NOT be encoded in
   the community.  Implementations MUST be prepared to accept a Wide
   Community Parameter TLV with an empty value field.

3.6.  Usage

   The detailed interpretation of the targets or parameters SHALL be
   provided when describing given community type in a separate document
   or when locally defined by an operator.


4.  Well Known Standard BGP Communities

   According to RFC 1997, as well as IANA's Well-Known BGP Communities
   registry, the following BGP communities are defined to have global
   significance:


        0xFFFF0000   planned-shut         [draft-francois-bgp-gshut]
        0xFFFFFF01   NO_EXPORT            [RFC1997]
        0xFFFFFF02   NO_ADVERTISE         [RFC1997]
        0xFFFFFF03   NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED  [RFC1997]
        0xFFFFFF04   NOPEER               [RFC3765]

   This document recommends for simplicity as well as for avoidance of
   backward compatibility issues the continued use of BGP Standard
   Community Attribute type 8 as defined in RFC 1997 to distribute non
   Autonomous System specific Well-Known BGP Communities.

   For the same reason, this document does not intended to obsolete the
   currently defined and deployed BGP Extended Communities.

5.  Operational considerations

   Having two different ways to propagate locally assigned BGP
   communities, one via the use of Standard BGP Communities and the
   other one via the use of Wide BGP Communities, may seem to
   potentially cause problems when considering propagation of
   conflicting actions.  However, even at present, an operator may
   append Standard BGP Communities with conflicting information.  It is
   therefore recommended that any implementation, in supporting both
   standard and Wide BGP communities, allow for their easy inbound and
   outbound processing.  The actual execution of all communities should
   be treated as a union and, if supported by an implementation, their
   execution permissions are to be a local configuration matter.


6.  Example

6.1.  Example Wide Community Definition

   An operator wishes to locally define a Wide Community with the
   semantics of permitting AS_PATH prepending with targets that include
   AS numbers of peer ASes and peers who have been marked with a set of
   defined "color" strings.

   Target semantics:

      Grouping containers MAY be used.

      The Autonomous System Number atom refers to the target peer AS
      Number.

      The UTF-8 String atom refers to a peer "color".  The values are
      constrained to the strings "red", "green" or "blue".

      The semantics of all other atoms are undefined for this community.

   Parameter semantics:

      The parameter TLV shall consist of exactly one integer value that
      is constrained to have a value of 2..8.

6.2.  Example Wide Community Encoding


     AS_PATH prepend 4 TIMES TO AS 2424, AS 8888, to peers marked as
     "red" or to peers marked "blue" AND AS 1111.

     Use Hop Count 0 to request the receiving router to not propagate
     this wide community.

     Locally community value (flag bit 0 = 0).
     Do not decrement Hop Count field across confederation boundaries
     (0)

     Local community 1 for sample AS 64512.

7.  Security considerations

   All the security considerations for BGP Communities as well as for
   BGP RFCs apply here.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP Path Attribute called Wide BGP
   Community Attribute.  For this new type IANA is to allocate a new
   value in the corresponding registry:

   Registry Name: BGP Path Attributes

   This document makes the following assignments for the optional,
   transitive Wide BGP Communities Attribute:



            Name                                     Type Value
            ----                                     ----------
            Wide BGP Community Attribute                 TBA


   This document requests IANA to define and maintain a new registry
   named: "Wide BGP Communities Attribute Container Types".

   The pool of: 0x0000-0xFFFF has been defined for its allocations.  The
   allocation policy is on a first come, first served basis.

   This document makes the following assignments for the Wide BGP
   Communities Attribute Types values:

         Name                             Type Value
         ----                             ----------
         Reserved                           0x0000
         Type 1                             0x0001
         Types 2-1023 to be allocated using IETF Consensus
         Types 1024-64511 to be allocated first come, first served
         Types 64512-65534 are reserved for experimental use
         Reserved                           0xFFFF

   This document requests IANA to define and maintain a new registry
   named: "Wide BGP Communities sub-TLV types".  The pool of 0x0000-
   0xFFFF has been defined for its allocations.  This document defines
   type 1.  Types 2-1024 are to be allocated using an IETF Consensus
   policy.  Types 1024-64511 are to be allocated on a first come, first
   served basis.  Types 64512-65534 are to be reserved for experimental

                Reserved                           0xFF



9.  Change History

   Changes from -02 to -03:

      Removed C and R named bit fields originally from -00.

      Rename Target AS field to Context AS.

      Make Integer Atom a fixed 4 octets in length.

      Add Neighbor Class Atom

      Rename TTL to Hop Count

   Changes from -01 to -02:

      The Type field has been expanded to 2 octets.

      The Length field has been moved to the common header.

      Changed format to use TLVs.

      Added atom TLV to define well defined syntactic items.

      Added TLVs to distinguish targets from parameters.

      Various editorial changes to language.
