          Registration Data Access Protocol Search Processing
                 draft-hollenbeck-weirds-rdap-search-01

Abstract

   This document describes path segments and query parameters needed to
   construct HTTP URLs that may be used to search for and retrieve
   registration information from registries (including both Regional
   Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs)) using
   "RESTful" web access patterns.  It also describes a method of
   encoding responses using Javascript Object Notation (JSON).

2.  Introduction

   This document describes a specification for registration data search
   functions using a RESTful web service.  The search functions are
   implemented using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616].

   Lookup processing as specified in [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query] is
   used when a client wishes to retrieve information associated with a
   data object represented by a character string that exactly matches a
   particular key.  There is no provision for partial string pattern
   matching to represent unknown characters or multiple result
   possibilities.  Experience with WHOIS [RFC3912] implementation and
   operation has shown that people are often unsure of exact spellings
   and they often want to receive multiple results that match a
   particular pattern.  This specification is intended to meet that need
   for the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP).


3.  Query and Search Parameters

   RDAP search path segments are formed using a concatenation of the
   plural form of the object being searched for, a forward slash
   character ('/', ASCII value 0x002F), and an HTTP query string.  The
   HTTP query string is formed using a concatenation of the question
   mark character ('?', ASCII value 0x003F), the JSON object value
   associated with the object being searched for, the equal sign
   character ('=', ASCII value 0x003D), and the search pattern.  For the
   domain and entity objects described in this document the plural
   objects forms are "domains" and "entities".  The JSON object value is
   "name".  One could construct a query string for an entity email
   address using the "email" object name, but that is beyond the scope
   of this specification.

3.1.  Domain Search

   Syntax: domains/?name=<domain search pattern>

   Searches for domain information are of the form /domains/?name=XXXX,
   where XXXX is a search pattern representing a fully-qualified domain
   name [RFC4343] in a zone administered by the server operator of a
   DNR.  (Open question: how do we do IDNs?)  The following path would
   be used to find DNR information for domain names matching the
   "example*.com" pattern:

   /domains/?name=example*.com

   Note that this search is relevant to DNRs, not RIRs.

3.2.  Entity Search

   Syntax: entities/?name=<entity search pattern>

   Searches for entity information are of the form /entities/?name=XXXX,
   where XXXX is a search pattern representing an entity name as
   specified in Section 7.1 of [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response].  The
   following path would be used to find DNR information for DNR entity
   names matching the "Bobby Joe*" pattern.

   /entities/?name=Bobby%20Joe*

   URLs MUST be properly encoded according to the rules of [RFC3986].
   In the example above, "Bobby Joe*" is encoded to "Bobby%20Joe*".


4.  Search Processing

   Searching occurs either on whole strings or on partial strings.
   Partial string searching uses the asterisk ('*', ASCII value 0x002A)
   character to match zero or more characters.  The location or number
   of occurances of the asterisk character is not dictated by this
   specification.  Some servers might support the asterisk in a trailing
   location only (e.g. "/domains/example*.com") while others may allow
   it a leading location (e.g. "/domains/*example.com"), or within
   strings, or even in multiple locations.

   If a server receives a search request but cannot process the request
   because it does not support a particular style of partial match
   searching, it SHOULD return an HTTP 422 [RFC4918] error.  When
   returning a 422 error, the server MAY also return an error response
   body as specified in Section 12 of [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response] if
   the requested media type is one that is specified in

Internet-Draft                 RDAP Search                 February 2013


   [I-D.ietf-weirds-using-http].

   The search patterns described in this document MAY include non-ASCII
   Unicode characters.  This document does not specify partial matching
   processing rules for Unicode or DNS u-label matching.  Partial string
   matching criteria for Unicode and DNS u-label characters is a matter
   of local server policy.  See Section 6 for guidelines that may be
   used to develop local policies.

   Clients SHOULD NOT submit search requests with partial matching for
   DNS a-labels.  A-labels represent an encoding that can only be
   reconstructed properly when the label is complete.


5.  Search Results

   The method to return search results described here is not limited to
   the /domains or /entities searches defined in this document.  It can
   also be used by future specifications to define search results for
   other types of registration data.

   Search results are returned in a JSON object.  This object contains
   data structures as outlined in Section 5 of
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response] (e.g. "rdapConformance", "notices",
   etc...) and an array called "results" containing the objects that are
   a result of the search.  For the /domains (Section 3.1) and /entities
   (Section 3.2) searches, the entity object class and the domain object
   class are defined in [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response].

   To identify the type of object returned in the "results" array, each
   object SHOULD contain a JSON string named "objectClass" (see Section
   4.2 of [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response] regarding the inclusion of new
   JSON data in object classes).  For domains, the string MUST be
   "domain" and for entities the string MUST be "entity".

   Servers SHOULD signify their compliance with this specification by
   including the string "domain_entity_search_level_0" in the
   "rdapConformance" array.

6.  Internationalization Considerations

   TBD.  Give guidelines for how a local policy could work for
   searching.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not specify any IANA actions.


8.  Security Considerations

   Security services for the operations specified in this document are
   described in "Security Services for the Registration Data Access
   Protocol" [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-sec].  As we identify specific use
   cases for which security services are needed they will be described
   here.
