    <t>This document extends the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defined in <xref target='RFC5070'>RFC 5070</xref> to facilitate enriched cybersecurity information exchange among cybersecurity entities by embedding structured information formatted by specifications, including <xref target='CAPEC'>CAPEC&trade;</xref>, <xref target='CEE'>CEE&trade;</xref>, <xref target='CPE'>CPE&trade;</xref>, <xref target='CVE'>CVE&reg;</xref>, <xref target='CVRF'>CVRF</xref>, <xref target='CVSS'>CVSS</xref>, <xref target='CWE'>CWE&trade;</xref>, <xref target='CWSS'>CWSS&trade;</xref>, <xref target='OCIL'>OCIL</xref>, <xref target='OVAL'>OVAL&reg;</xref>, and <xref target='XCCDF'>XCCDF</xref>.</t>

  </abstract>

<middle>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="ext-intro">

<t>
Cyber attacks are getting more sophisticated, and their numbers are increasing day by day.
To cope with such situation, incident information needs to be reported, exchanged, and shared among organizations.
IODEF is one of the tools enabling such exchange, and is already in use.
</t>

<t>
To efficiently run cybersecurity operations, these exchanged information needs to be machine-readable.
IODEF provides a structured means to describe the information, but it needs to embed various non-structured such information in order to convey detailed information.
Further structure within IODEF increases IODEF documents' machine-readability and thus facilitates streamlining cybersecurity operations.
</t>

<t>
On the other hand, there exist various other activities facilitating detailed and structured description of cybersecurity information, major of which includes <xref target='CAPEC'>CAPEC</xref>, <xref target='CEE'>CEE</xref>, <xref target='CPE'>CPE</xref>, <xref target='CVE'>CVE</xref>, <xref target='CVRF'>CVRF</xref>, <xref target='CVSS'>CVSS</xref>, <xref target='CWE'>CWE</xref>, <xref target='CWSS'>CWSS</xref>, <xref target='OCIL'>OCIL</xref>, <xref target='OVAL'>OVAL</xref>, and <xref target='XCCDF'>XCCDF</xref>.
Since such structured description facilitates cybersecurity operations, it would be beneficial to embed and convey these information inside IODEF document.
</t>
<t>
To enable that, this document extends the IODEF to embed and convey various structured cybersecurity information, with which cybersecurity operations can be facilitated.
Since IODEF defines a flexible and extensible format and supports a granular level of specificity, this document defines an extension to IODEF instead of defining a new report format.
For clarity, and to eliminate duplication, only the additional structures necessary for describing the exchange of such structured information are provided.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Terminology" anchor="ext-terminology">

<t>
The terminology used in this document follows the one defined in <xref target="RFC5070">RFC 5070</xref>. </t>

   <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Applicability" anchor="ext-applicability">

    <t>To maintain cybersecurity, organization needs to exchange cybersecurity information, which includes the following information: attack pattern, platform information, vulnerability and weakness, countermeasure instruction, computer event log, and the severity.</t>

    <t>IODEF provides a scheme to exchange such information among interested parties. However, the detailed common format to describe such information is not defined in the IODEF base document.</t>

    <t>On the other hand, to describe those information and to facilitate exchange, a structured format for that is already available. Major of them are CAPEC, CEE, CPE, CVE, CVRF, CVSS, CWE, CWSS, OCIL, OVAL, and XCCDF.
By embedding them into the IODEF document, the document can convey more detailed contents to the receivers, and the document can be easily reused. Note that interactive communication is needed in some cases, and some of these structured information, e.g., OCIL information, solicits reply from recipients. These reply could be also embedded inside the IODEF document.</t>

    <t>These structured cybersecurity information facilitates cybersecurity operation at the receiver side. Since the information is machine-readable, the data can be processed by computers. That expedites the automation of cybersecurity operations</t>

    <t>For instance, an organization wishing to report a security incident wants to describe what vulnerability was exploited. Then the sender can simply use IODEF, where an CAPEC record is embedded instead of describing everything in free format text. Receiver can also identify the needed details of the attack pattern by looking up some of the <xref target="XML1.0">xml</xref> tags defined by CAPEC. Receiver can accumulate the attack pattern information (CAPEC record) in its database and could distribute it to the interested parties if needed, without needing human interventions.</t>

</section>

<section title="Extension Definition" anchor="ext-definition">

<t>This draft extends IODEF to embed structured cybersecurity information by introducing new classes, with which these information can be embedded inside IODEF document as element contents of AdditionalData and RecordItem classes.
</t>

<section title="List of Supported Structured Cybersecurity Information Specifictions" anchor="SpecificationList">

<t>
This extension embeds structured cybersecurity information from external specifications.
The initial list of supported specifications is listed below.
Each entry has <xref target="XMLNames">namespace</xref>, specification name, version, reference URI and applicable classes for each specification.
Arbitrary URIs that may help readers to understand the specification could be embedded inside the Reference URI field, but it is recommended that standard/informational URI describing the specification is prepared and is embedded here.</t>

<t>Future assignments are to be managed by IANA using the <xref target='RFC5226'>Expert Review</xref> and <xref target='RFC5226'>Specification Required</xref> allocation policies as further specified in <xref target="ext-iana"/>.</t>

<t>
The SpecID attributes of <xref target='ExtendedClasses'>extended classes</xref> must allow the values of the specifications' namespace fields, but otherwise, implementations are not required to support all the above specifications.
Implementations may choose which specifications to support, though <xref target="CVE_1.0">CVE 1.0</xref> needs to be minimally supported, as described in <xref target='MTI'/>.
In case an implementation received a data it does not support, it may expand its functionality by looking up the IANA table or notify the sender of its inability to parse the data by using any means defined outside the scope of this specification.</t>

   <t>An AttackPattern consists of an extension to the Incident.Method.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml". The extension describes attack patterns of incidents or events.</t>

<t>It is recommended that Method class SHOULD contain one or more of the extension elements whenever available.</t>

<t>This class has the following attributes.</t>

<t>
<list style="hanging">

  <t hangText="SpecID:">REQUIRED. ENUM.
  The identifier of the specification specifying the format of the RawData element.
  The value should be chosen from the <xref target="XMLNames">namespaces</xref> listed in <xref target="SpecificationList"/> or "private".
  Note that the lists in <xref target="SpecificationList"/> will be developed further by IANA.
  In case a RawData or Reference element is provided along with this attribute, writers/senders MUST ensure that this value is consistent with the one provided by the element; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer this attribute's value, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.
  The value "private" is prepared for conveying RawData based on a format that is not listed in the table. This is usually used for conveying data formatted according to an organization's private schema.
  When the value "private" is used, ext-SpecID element needs to be used.
</t>

  <t hangText="ext-SpecID:">OPTIONAL. STRING.
  The identifier of the specification specifying the format of the RawData element.
  When this element is used, the value of SpecID element must be "private."

</t>

  <t hangText="AttackPatternID:">OPTIONAL. STRING.
  An identifier of an attack pattern to be reported.
  This attribute SHOULD be used whenever such identifier is available, but could be omitted if no such one is available. In this case, either RawData or Reference elements, or both of them, MUST be provided.
  In case a RawData or Reference element is provided along with this attribute, writers/senders MUST ensure that this value is consistent with the one provided by the element; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer this attribute's value, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

  This element allows an IODEF document to include a link to a structured information instead of directly embedding it into a RawData element.</t>

  <t hangText="Platform:">Zero or more.
  An identifier of software platform involved in the specific attack pattern, which is elaborated in <xref target="sec_Platform"/>.
  Some of the structured information embedded in the RawData element may include the identifier within it.
  In this case, this Platform element SHOULD NOT be used.

   <t>This document specifies a format for encoding a particular class of
   security incidents appropriate for exchange across organizations.  As
   merely a data representation, it does not directly introduce security
   issues.  However, it is guaranteed that parties exchanging instances
   of this specification will have certain concerns.  For this reason,
   the underlying message format and transport protocol used MUST ensure
   the appropriate degree of confidentiality, integrity, and
   authenticity for the specific environment.</t>

   <t>Organizations that exchange data using this document are URGED to
   develop operating procedures that document the following areas of
   concern.</t>

<section title="Transport-Specific Concerns">

   <t>The underlying messaging format and protocol used to exchange
   instances of the IODEF MUST provide appropriate guarantees of
   confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.  The use of a
   standardized security protocol is encouraged.  The <xref target='RFC6045'>Real-time Inter-
   network Defense (RID) protocol</xref> and <xref target='RFC6046'>its associated transport
   binding </xref> provide such security.</t>

   <t>The critical security concerns are that these structured information may
   be falsified or they may become corrupt during transit.
   In areas where transmission security or secrecy is questionable, the
   application of a digital signature and/or message encryption on each
   report will counteract both of these concerns. We expect that each
   exchanging organization will determine the need, and mechanism, for
   transport protection. </t>

    <t>This memo creates the following registry for IANA to manage:</t>

    <t><list>
    <t>Name of the registry: "IODEF Structured Cyber Security Information Specifications"</t>
    <t>Namespace details: A registry entry for a Structured Cyber Security Information Specification (SCI specification) consists of:
       <list>
       <t>Namespace: A <xref target='RFC3986'>URI</xref> that is the XML namespace name used by the registered SCI specification.</t>
       <t>Specification Name: A string containing the spelled-out name of the SCI specification in human-readable form.</t>
       <t>Reference URI: A list of one or more of the <xref target='RFC3986'>URIs</xref> from which the registered specification can be obtained. The registered specification MUST be readily and publicly available from that URI.</t>
       <t>Applicable Classes: A list of one or more of the Extended Classes specified in <xref target='ExtendedClasses'/> of this document. The registered SCI specification MUST only be used with the Extended Classes in the registry entry.</t>
       </list>
    </t>

    <t>Information that must be provided to assign a new value: The above list of information.</t>

    <t>Fields to record in the registry: Namespace/Specification Name/Version/Applicable Classes.</t>
    <t>Initial registry contents: See sections from <xref target="CAPEC_1.6"/> through <xref target="XCCDF_1.2"/> above.</t>
    <t>Allocation Policy: <xref target='RFC5226'>Expert Review</xref> and <xref target='RFC5226'>Specification Required</xref>.</t>
    </list></t>

    <t>The Designated Expert is expected to consult with the mile (Managed Incident Lightweight Exchange) working group or its successor if any such WG exists (e.g., via email to the working group's mailing list). The Designated Expert is expected to retrieve the SCI specification from the provided URI in order to check the public availability of the specification and verify the correctness of the URI. An important responsibility of the Designated Expert is to ensure that the registered Applicable Classes are appropriate for the registered SCI specification.</t>
