                            DECADE Use Cases
                      draft-xue-decade-usecase-00

Abstract

   The objective of DECADE is to provide storage access to Content
   Distribution Applications to improve their efficiency and reduce load
   on the network infrastructure.

   In this document, we outline several potential use cases (not
   technical solutions) for DECADE.  These use cases may provide
   motivations for DECADE.  Interactions within DECADE and between
   DECADE Servers and DECADE Clients are described at an abstract level
   so as to not constrain future protocol development.

Internet-Draft                   Usecase                      March 2012


1.  Introduction

   DECADE provides standard in-network storage for content distribution
   applications.  Specifically, with access to in-network storage,
   content distribution applications can improve their efficiency and
   reduce load on the network infrastructure.  For example, instead of
   always uploading data objects directly from a source/owner client to
   a requesting client, the source/owner client can upload from in-
   network storage, saving uplink bandwidth.

   This document describes several use cases to motivate DECADE.  These
   use cases may provide motivations for the design and deployment of
   DECADE.  Also, a use case indicating our consideration of integrating
   DECADE with CDNI is presented in this draft, in order to explore
   potential benifits of combining them as well as possible further work
   directions.


2.  Terminologies

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "WOULD",
   "COULD", "CANNOT", "MIGHT", and "MAY"in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   We use the following terms that are defined [draft-ietf-decade-arch-
   03].

   Provider based in-network storage: A service inside a network that
   provides storage and bandwidth to network applications.  In-network
   storage may reduce upload/transit/backbone traffic and improve
   network application performance.

   DECADE Server: A DECADE Server stores data from Application End-
   Points, and provides control and access of those data to Application
   End-Points.  Note that a DECADE Server is not necessarily a single
   physical machine; it could also be implemented as a cluster of
   machines.

   DECADE Client: A DECADE Client stores and retrieves data at DECADE
   Servers.

   Application End-Point: An Application End-Point is an instance of a
   Content Distribution Application that makes use of DECADE Server(s).
   A particular Application End-Point may be a DECADE Content Provider,
   a DECADE Content Consumer, or both.  For example, an Application End-
   Point may be an instance of a video streaming client, or it may be
   the source providing the video to a set of clients.

3.  Example Use Cases

3.1.  P2P File Sharing

   Related Applications: There are many P2P file sharing applications,
   e.g., BitTorrent, Shareaza, Ares.  The most widely used is
   BitTorrent.

   Original setting: In BiTorrent without DECADE, a client uploads to
   its peers using its last mile.  This consumes expensive last-mile
   uplink bandwidth.

   BiTorrent with DECADE: In the new setting, a client first uploads to
   a DECADE Server, who can then serve other clients.

   Figure 1 shows an example.  In this example, Client B first uploads
   shared files to DECADE Server B, then Client A and Client C can get
   the file by their DECADE Servers.

   shared file to its DECADE server for one time.  This saves last mile
   uplink bandwidth, which is expensive.

3.2.  End User Video Conference

   Related Applications: There are multiple widely video conference
   applications, including Skype, Webex.  The end users using the
   conference applications can be either desktop based or mobile
   devices.

   Video Conference without DECADE: As it is shown if figure 2, Client A
   and Client C send the voice and video to Client B, Client B mix its
   own packets with those send from Client A and Client C, then send the
   mixed packets to them.

                             Figure 2

   Video Conference with DECADE: Figure 3 shows a example of video
   conference using DECADE.  In this example, each client upload its
   video and audio data for one time, and DECACE Servers will mixed the
   packets and send to each users.

   Benefits: in Original setting, the mixer (Client B in figure 2) need
   upload twice, while in Video Conference with DECADE each user only
   need upload its video and audio for one time.  This saves last mile
   uplink bandwidth.

3.3.  Offline P2P live streaming

   Related Applications: There are many P2P live streaming applications,
   e.g., PPLive, PPStream.

   Original setting: In P2P live streaming without DECADE, clients may
   get a bad user experience when they watch the streaming after
   broadcasting at a later time, Since there will be not enough

   audiences to watch it after living broadcast.

   P2P live streaming with DECADE: By using DECADE, a client can watch a
   live streaming at a later time, and still have a good video quality.

   Figure 4 shows an example.  In this example, Client B is broadcasting
   a live streaming.  Client C is offline and wants to watch this
   streaming at a later time.  DECADE Server C will hold the living
   streaming data for Client C. After Client C once is online, it can
   get the streaming directly for its DCEADE Server C.

   Benefits: in Original setting, clients missed living streaming
   broadcast, may get a bad video quality when they watch it at a latter
   time.  While in DECADE the video quality is also good since Client C
   download it directly from its DECADE Server.  Also, DECADE can help
   to save last mile uplink bandwidth in this use case.

   Social Networks without DECADE: As it is shown in figure 5, Client A
   post a message to Facebook Server, then the Server update this
   message to Client B, Client C and Client D. There are data
   transmission both in inter-domain and intra-domain.

4.  Integration of DECADE and CDNI

4.1.  Consideration of Integrating DECADE and CDNI

   As mentioned above, DECADE provides standard in-network storage for
   content distribution applications, which can reduce load on internet
   infrastructure as well as improve the efficiency of these
   applications.  CDNI is aimded at providing uniformed interfaces over
   which two or more CDNs communicate with each other in order to
   achieve the delivery of content to User Agents by Surrogates in one

   CDN (the downstream CDN) on behalf of another CDN (the upstream
   CDN)[I-D.ietf-cdni-problem-statement-03].  The work of DECADE and
   CDNI are complementary to each other in some respects.  DECADE
   architecture and mechanism can be used for data exchange between
   different CDNs, while CDNI supports negotiation between them, in
   which upstream CDN could indicate the downstream CDN to acquire
   content from certain in-network storages (DECADE Servers).

4.2.  An Example Use Case

   Taking Multi-player Online Game application as an example, Figure 8
   shows the idea of integrating DECADE and CDNI.  In this example, both
   Client A and Client B belong to CDN-1, while Client C is connected to
   CDN-2.  Each Client store its own game-related data to its own DECADE
   Server and also retrieve other Clients' data from it.  The
   communication between CDN-1 and CDN-2 is conducted by CDNI.  Through
   CDNI, the upstream CDN indicates where its downstream CDN could
   retrieve data it wants.

   Benefits: The integration of DECADE and CDNI may result in improved
   quality of experience for end users, as well as reduced last-mile
   uplink bandwidth.  The benefits may not be obvious when there are
   only few content delivery between two different CDNs, but it may have
   significant benefits in certain situations.
