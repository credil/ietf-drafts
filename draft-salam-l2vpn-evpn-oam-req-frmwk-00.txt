INTERNET DRAFT    E-VPN OAM Requirements and Framework  October 15, 2012


1  Introduction

   This document specifies the requirements and defines a reference
   framework for Ethernet VPN (E-VPN) Operations, Administration and
   Maintenance (OAM, [RFC6291]). In this context, we use the term E-VPN
   OAM to loosely refer to the OAM functions required for and/or
   applicable to [E-VPN], [PBB-EVPN] as well as [TRILL-EVPN].

   E-VPN introduces an L2VPN solution for multipoint Ethernet services,
   with advanced multi-homing capabilities, using BGP for distributing
   customer/client MAC address reach-ability information over the core
   MPLS/IP network.

   PBB-EVPN combines Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) [802.1ah] with E-
   VPN in order to reduce the number of BGP MAC advertisement routes,
   provide client MAC address mobility using C-MAC aggregation and B-MAC
   sub-netting, confine the scope of C-MAC learning to only active
   flows, offer per site policies and avoid C-MAC address flushing on
   topology changes.

   TRILL-EVPN provides a solution for interconnecting TRILL [TRILL]
   networks over an MPLS/IP network using E-VPN, with two key
   characteristics: C-MAC address transparency on the hand-off point and
   control-plane isolation among the interconnected TRILL networks.

   This document focuses on the fault management and performance
   management aspects of E-VPN OAM.

1.1 Relationship to Other OAM Work

   This document leverages concepts and draws upon elements defined
   and/or used in the following documents:

   [RFC6136] specifies the requirements and a reference model for OAM as
   it relates to L2VPN services, pseudowires and associated Public
   Switched Network tunnels. This document focuses on VPLS and VPWS
   solutions and services.

   [RFC4379] defines mechanisms for detecting data plane failures in
   MPLS LSPs, including procedures to check the correct operation of the
   data plane, as well as mechanisms to verify the data plane against
   the control plane. 

   [802.1Q] specifies the Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM)
   protocol, which defines the concepts of Maintenance Domains,
   Maintenance End Points, and Maintenance Intermediate Points.

   [Y.1731] extends Connectivity Fault Management in the following

   areas: it defines fault notification and alarm suppression functions
   for Ethernet.  It also specifies mechanisms for Ethernet performance
   management, including loss, delay, jitter, and throughput
   measurement.

1.2  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.3 Terminology

   This document uses the following terminology defined in [RFC6136]:

   MEP         Maintenance End Point is responsible for origination and
               termination of OAM frames for a given MEG.

   MIP         Maintenance Intermediate Point is located between peer
               MEPs and can process and respond to certain OAM frames
               but does not initiate or terminate them.

   Maintenance Domain  OAM Domain represents a region over which OAM 
                       frames can operate unobstructed.

2 E-VPN OAM Framework

2.1 OAM Layering

   Multiple layers come into play for implementing an L2VPN service with
   the E-VPN family of solutions:

   - The Service Layer runs end to end between the sites, or Ethernet
   Segments, that are being interconnected by the E-VPN solution. It can
   be either Ethernet (as in [E-VPN], [PBB-EVPN] and [SPB-EVPN]) or
   TRILL (as in [TRILL-EVPN]).

   - The Network Layer extends in between the E-VPN PE nodes and is
   mostly transparent to the core nodes (except where Flow Entropy comes
   into play). It leverages MPLS for service (i.e. EVI) multiplexing and
   Split-Horizon functions.

   - The Transport Layer is dictated by the networking technology of the
   PSN. It may be either based on MPLS LSPs or IP.

   - The Link Layer is dependent upon the physical technology used.
   Ethernet is a popular choice for this layer, but other alternatives
   are deployed (e.g. POS, DWDM etc...).

   This layering extends to the set of OAM protocols that are involved
   in the ongoing maintenance and diagnostics of E-VPN networks. The
   figure below depicts the OAM layering, and shows which devices have
   visibility into what OAM layer(s).

                      Figure 1: E-VPN OAM Layering

2.2 E-VPN Service OAM

   The E-VPN Service OAM protocol depends on what service layer is being
   transported by the E-VPN solution. In case of [E-VPN] and [PBB-EVPN],
   the service OAM protocol is Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management
   (CFM) [802.1Q]. Whereas, in case of [TRILL-EVPN], the service OAM
   protocol is TRILL OAM [TRILL-OAM].

   E-VPN service OAM is visible to the CEs and E-VPN PEs, but not to the
   core (P) nodes. This is because the PEs operate at the Ethernet MAC
   layer in [E-VPN][PBB-EVPN], or the TRILL RBridge layer in [TRILL-
   EVPN], whereas the P nodes do not.

   The E-VPN PE should support both MEP and MIP functions for the
   associated service OAM protocol. 

2.3 E-VPN Network OAM

   E-VPN Network OAM is visible to the PE nodes only. This OAM layer is
   analogous to pseudowire OAM in the case of VPLS/VPWS. It provides
   capabilities to test connectivity for:

   - a given unicast MAC address in a bridge-domain within an EVI (to
   verify unicast connectivity)

INTERNET DRAFT    E-VPN OAM Requirements and Framework  October 15, 2012


   - a given Ethernet Segment in an EVI (to verify the correct operation
   of Aliasing)

   - a given multicast group in a bridge-domain within an EVI (to verify
   multicast connectivity), including verification of the DF Election
   status and Split-Horizon filtering.

   For the E-VPN network OAM mechanisms to be truly in-band, their
   messages must be encoded so that they exhibit identical entropy
   characteristics to data traffic.

2.4 Transport OAM for E-VPN

   The transport OAM protocol depends on the nature of the underlying
   transport in the PSN. MPLS OAM mechanisms [RFC4379][RFC6425] as well
   as ICMP [RFC792] are applicable, depending on whether the PSN employs
   MPLS or IP transport, respectively.

2.5 Link OAM

   Link OAM depends on the data link technology being used between the
   PE and P nodes. For e.g., if Ethernet links are employed, then
   Ethernet Link OAM [802.3] Clause 57 may be used.

3 E-VPN OAM Requirements

   This section discusses the E-VPN OAM requirements pertaining to Fault
   Management and Performance Management. In a future revision of this
   document, we will identify the OAM layer(s) to which each of the
   requirements applies.

3.1 Fault Management Requirements

3.1.1 Proactive Fault Management Functions

   Proactive fault management functions are configured by the network
   operator to run periodically without a time bound, or are configured
   to trigger certain actions upon the occurrence of specific events.

3.1.1.1 Fault Detection (Continuity Check)

   Proactive fault detection is performed by periodically monitoring the
   reachability between service endpoints, i.e. MEPs in a given MA,
   through the exchange of Continuity Check messages. The reachability
   between any two arbitrary MEPs may be monitored for:

   - a specified path taken by a particular user data flow. This enables
   per Flow monitoring of data paths. E-VPN OAM must support per user

INTERNET DRAFT    E-VPN OAM Requirements and Framework  October 15, 2012


   flow fault detection.

   - a representative path. This enables liveness check of the nodes
   hosting the MEPs but does not conclusively indicate liveness of the
   path(s) taken by user data traffic. This enables node failure
   detection but not path failure detection, through the use of a test
   flow. E-VPN OAM must support per test flow fault detection.

   - all paths. For MPLS/IP networks with ECMP, monitoring of all
   unicast paths between MEPs may not be possible, since the per-hop
   ECMP hashing behavior may yield situations where it is impossible for
   a MEP to pick flow entropy characteristics that result in exercising
   the exhaustive set of ECMP paths. Monitoring of all ECMP paths
   between MEPs is not a requirement for E-VPN OAM.

   The fact that MPLS/IP networks do not enforce congruency between
   unicast and multicast paths means that the proactive fault detection
   mechanisms for E-VPN must provide procedures to monitor the unicast
   paths independently of the multicast paths.

3.1.1.2 Defect Indication

   E-VPN OAM MUST support event-driven defect indication upon the
   detection of a connectivity defect. Defect indications can be
   categorized into two types: forward and reverse defect indications.

3.1.1.2.1 Forward Defect Indication

   This is used to signal a failure that is detected by a lower layer
   OAM mechanism. Forward Defect indication is transmitted by a server
   MEP (i.e. an actual or virtual MEP) in a direction that is away from
   the direction of the failure (refer to Figure 2 below).

                           Failure
                             | 
      +-----+      +-----+   V   +-----+      +-----+
      |  A  |------|  B  |--XXX--|  C  |------|  D  |
      +-----+      +-----+       +-----+      +-----+

          <===========|             |============>
            Forward                    Forward
            Defect                     Defect 
            Indication                 Indication

                  Figure 2: Forward Defect Indication

   Forward defect indication may be used for alarm suppression and/or
   for purpose of inter-working with other layer OAM protocols. Alarm

   suppression is useful when a transport/network level fault translates
   to multiple service or flow level faults. In such a scenario, it is
   enough to alert a network management station (NMS) of the single
   transport/network level fault in lieu of flooding that NMS with a
   multitude of Service or Flow granularity alarms.

3.1.1.2.2 Reverse Defect Indication (RDI)

   RDI is used to signal that the advertising MEP has detected a loss of
   continuity (LoC) defect. RDI is transmitted in the direction of the
   failure (refer to Figure 3).

                           Failure
                             | 
      +-----+      +-----+   V   +-----+      +-----+
      |  A  |------|  B  |--XXX--|  C  |------|  D  |
      +-----+      +-----+       +-----+      +-----+

          |===========>             <============|
            Reverse                    Reverse
            Defect                     Defect 
            Indication                 Indication

                  Figure 3: Reverse Defect Indication

   RDI allows single-sided management, where the network operator can
   examine the state of a single MEP and deduce the overall health of a
   monitored service.

3.1.2 On-Demand Fault Management Functions

   On-demand fault management functions are initiated manually by the
   network operator and continue for a time bound period. These
   functions enable the operator to run diagnostics to investigate a
   defect condition.

3.1.2.1 Connectivity Verification

   E-VPN OAM must support on-demand connectivity verification for
   unicast and multicast. The connectivity verification mechanism should
   provide a means for specifying and carrying in the messages:

   - variable length payload/padding to test MTU related connectivity
   problems.

   - test traffic patterns as defined in [RFC2544].

   For multicast connectivity verification, E-VPN OAM must support

   reporting on:

   - DF Election Status

   - Split Horizon Filtering Status

3.1.2.2 Fault Isolation

   E-VPN OAM must support an on-demand connectivity fault localization
   function. This involves the capability to narrow down the locality of
   a fault to a particular port, link or node. The characteristic of
   forward/reverse path asymmetry, in MPLS/IP, renders fault isolation
   into a direction-sensitive operation. That is, given two PEs A and B,
   localization of connectivity faults between them requires running
   fault isolation procedures from PE A to PE B as well as from PE B to
   PE A.

3.2 Performance Management

   Performance Management functions can be performed both proactively
   and on-demand. Proactive management involves a scheduling function,
   where the performance management probes can be triggered on a
   recurring basis. Since the basic performance management functions
   involved are the same, we make no distinction between proactive and
   on-demand functions in this section.

3.2.1 Packet Loss

   E-VPN OAM must provide mechanisms for measuring packet loss for a
   given service.

   Given that E-VPN provides inherent support for multipoint-to-
   multipoint connectivity, then packet loss cannot be accurately
   measured by means of counting user data packets. This is because user
   packets can be delivered to more RBridges or more ports than are
   necessary (e.g. due to broadcast, un-pruned multicast or unknown
   unicast flooding). As such, a statistical means of approximating
   packet loss rate is required. This can be achieved by sending
   "synthetic" OAM packets that are counted only by those ports (MEPs)
   that are required to receive them. This provides a statistical
   approximation of the number of data frames lost, even with
   multipoint-to-multipoint connectivity.

3.2.2 Packet Delay

   E-VPN OAM must support measurement of one-way and two-way packet
   delay and delay variation (jitter).

INTERNET DRAFT    E-VPN OAM Requirements and Framework  October 15, 2012


4.  Security Considerations

   E-VPN OAM must provide mechanisms for:

   - Preventing denial of service attacks caused by exploitation of the
   OAM message channel.

   - Optionally authenticate communicating endpoints (MEPs and MIPs)

   - Preventing OAM packets from leaking outside of the E-VPN network or
   outside their corresponding Maintenance Domain. This can be done by
   having MEPs implement a filtering function based on the Maintenance
   Level associated with received OAM packets.

5.  IANA Considerations

   None.
