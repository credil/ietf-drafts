Internet-Draft           Summary Stats XR Blocks            October 2012


1.  Introduction

   This draft defines three new block types to augment those defined in
   Freidman, et al. [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The first two block types support the reporting of burst gap loss/
   discard summary statistics including packet loss/discard proportion,
   mean and variance and belong to the class of transport-related end
   system metrics defined in Wu, Hunt & Arden
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-monarch].  These two blocks are intended to be used
   in conjunction with information from the Burst Gap Loss metric block
   or Burst Gap Discard metric block, and on which these two block
   therefore depend.  The metrics in the Burst Gap Loss block or Burst
   Gap Discard metric block can be used independently of the metrics
   defined in the first two blocks, however.  These two blocks reflect
   transient IP problems that affect user experience and can be used to
   influence sender strategies to mitigate the problem.

   To form an accurate assessment of users' quality of experience, it is
   therefore necessary to know not just overall rates of packet loss/
   discard, but also which frame types were affected.  The third block
   supports the reporting of detailed statistics for each frame type,
   including the number of frames received, lost and discarded of each
   frame type in the Group of Pictures (GOP) and additional data
   allowing the calculation of statistical parameters (e.g.,the
   proportion of each frame type impaired by packet loss and discard).
   The metrics defined in this block belong to the class of application
   layer metrics defined in Wu, Hunt & Arden [I-D.ietf-avtcore-monarch].


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Picture Type

      Picture Types used in the different video algorithms are composed
      of the Key frame and Derived frames.  The Key frame is also called
      a reference frame and used as a reference for predicting other
      pictures.  It is coded without prediction from other pictures.
      Derived frames are derived from a Key frame using a prediction
      algorithm.

3.  Transport Related End System Metrics

3.1.  Burst/Gap Loss Summary Statistics Block

   The metrics described here are intended to be used as described in
   this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement
   Information block [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-meas-identity] (which
   MUST be present in the same RTCP packet as the Burst/Gap Loss block)
   and also with the metric "cumulative number of packets lost" provided
   in standard RTCP [RFC3550].

   These metrics provide information relevant to statistical parameters,
   including burst loss rate, gap loss rate, burst duration mean, burst
   duration variance and are calculated using burst gap loss metrics
   defined in [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-burst-gap-loss] and other
   information which is sent together with this report block.

3.1.2.  Definition of Fields in Loss Summary Statistics Block

   Block Type (BT): 8 bits

      Burst/Gap Loss Summary Statistics Block is identified by the
      constant <BGLSS>.

   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits

      This field is used to indicate whether the Burst/Gap Loss Summary
      Statistics metrics are Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics,
      that is, whether the reported values apply to the most recent
      measurement interval duration between successive metrics reports
      (I=10) (the Interval Duration) or to the accumulation period
      characteristic of cumulative measurements (I=11) (the Cumulative
      Duration) or is a sampled instantaneous value (I=01) (Sampled
      Value).

   Reserved: 6 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      SHOULD be ignored by the receiver.

   Block Length: 16 bits

      The constant 3, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC3611 [RFC3611].

   Burst Loss Rate: 16 bits

      The fraction of packets lost during bursts since the beginning of
      reception, expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point
      at the left edge of the field.  This value is calculated by
      dividing Packets Loss in Bursts by Total Packets expected in
      Bursts as follows:

      Packets Loss in Bursts / Total Packets expected in Bursts

   Gap Loss Rate: 16 bits

      The fraction of packets lost during gaps since the beginning of
      reception expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point
      at the left edge of the field.  This value is calculated by
      dividing the difference between number of packets lost and Packets
      lost in Bursts by the difference between Packets Expected and
      Total Packets expected in Bursts as follows:

      (number of packets lost - Packets Lost in Bursts) / (Packets
      Expected - Total Packets expected in Bursts)

      where "number of packets lost" is obtained from standard RTCP
      [RFC3550] and Packets Expected is calculated as the difference
      between "extended last sequence number" and "extended first
      sequence number" (Interval or Cumulative) provided in the
      Measurement Identity and Information block
      [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-meas-identity].

      Note that if the metric is to be calculated on an Interval basis,
      a difference must be taken between the current and preceding
      values of "cumulative number of packets lost" in RTCP, to obtain
      the "number of packets lost" for the reporting interval.

Internet-Draft           Summary Stats XR Blocks            October 2012


   Burst Duration Mean:16bits

      The mean burst duration is obtained as the quotient:

      mean = Sum of Burst Durations / Number of Bursts

      where "Sum of Burst Durations" and "Number of Bursts" is obtained
      from the RTCP XR Burst/Gap Loss Block
      [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-burst-gap-loss].

   Burst Duration Variance:16bits

      The variance of the burst duration is obtained using the standard
      result:

      var = ( Sum of Squares of Burst Durations - Number of Bursts *
      mean^2 ) / (Number of Bursts - 1)

      where "Sum of Squares of Burst Durations" and "Number of Bursts"is
      obtained from the RTCP XR Burst/Gap Loss Block
      [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-burst-gap-loss].


3.2.  Burst/Gap Discard Summary Statistics Block

   The metrics described here are intended to be used as described in
   this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement
   Identity block [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-meas-identity] (which MUST
   be present in the same RTCP packet as the Burst/Gap Discard Summary
   Statistics block) and also with the metric "number of packets
   discarded" provided in the RTCP XR Discard Block
   [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard].  The RTCP XR Discard Block SHOULD
   be sent if the Burst/Gap Discard Summary Statistics block is sent,
   but the converse does not apply.

   These metrics provide information relevant to statistical parameters,
   including burst discard rate, gap discard rate and are calculated
   using burst gap loss metrics defined in
   [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-burst-gap-discard] and other information
   which is sent together with this report block.

   Interval Metric Type (I): 2 bits

      This field is used to indicate whether the Burst/Gap Discard
      Summary Statistics metrics are Sampled, Interval or Cumulative
      metrics, that is, whether the reported values applies to the most
      recent measurement interval duration between successive metrics
      reports (I=10) (the Interval Duration) or to the accumulation

   Burst Discard Rate: 16 bits

      The fraction of packets discarded during bursts since the
      beginning of reception, expressed as a fixed point number with the
      binary point at the left edge of the field.  This value is
      calculated by dividing Packets Discarded in Bursts by Total
      Packets expected in Bursts as follows:

      Packets Discarded in Bursts / Total Packets expected in Bursts

   Gap Discard Rate: 16 bits

      The fraction of packets discarded during gaps since the beginning
      of reception expressed as a fixed point number with the binary
      point at the left edge of the field.  This value is calculated by
      dividing the difference between number of packets discarded and
      Packets Discarded in Bursts by the difference between Packets
      Expected and Total Packets expected in Bursts as follows:

      (number of packets discarded - Packets Discarded in Bursts) /
      (Packets Expected - Total Packets expected in Bursts)

      where "number of packets discarded" is obtained from the RTCP XR
      Discard Count Block [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard] and Packets
      Expected is calculated as the difference between "extended last
      sequence number" and "extended first sequence number" (Interval or
      Cumulative) provided in the Measurement Information block
      [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-meas-identity].  In order for the Burst/
      Gap Discard Summary Statistics Block to be meaningful either

      1.  a single instance of the Discard Count block with DT=3 or
      2.  exactly 2 instances of the Discard Count block with DT=1 and
          DT=2, respectively

      MUST be included in the same RTCP compound packet.  If a Discard
      Count block with DT=3 is received, "the number of packet
      discarded" is be filled with the number of packets discarded due
      to both early and late arrival; otherwise, "the number of packet
      discarded" is calculated as the sum of packet discards due to
      early arrival (DT=1) and packet discards due to late arrival
      (DT=2).

4.1.2.  Definition of Fields in Frame Impairment Summary Statistics
        Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      Frame Impairment Statistics Summary Block is identified by the
      constant <FISS>.

   Picture type indicator (I): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate the frame type to be reported.  The
      bit is set to 0 if the lost_full_frames, lost_partial_frames and
      dup_frames fields contain Key frame (reference frame) counts or 1
      if they contain Derivation frame counts.  Note that if both the
      Key frame and Derivation frame report are sent, they should be

   Reserved: 7 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      SHOULD be ignored by the receiver.

   Block Length: 16 bits

      The constant 7, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC3611 [RFC3611].

   Begin_seq: 16 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   end_seq: 16 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   Number of frames received:32 bits

      A count of the number of frames received in the above sequence
      number interval, estimated if necessary.  If no frames have been
      received then this count SHALL be set to zero.

   Number of discarded frames (discarded_frames): 32 bits

      Number of frames discarded in the above sequence number interval.

   Number of duplicate frames (dup_frames): 32 bits

      Number of duplicate frames received in the above sequence number
      interval.

   Number of full frames lost (lost_full_frames): 32 bits

      If one frame is completely lost, this frame is regarded as one
      lost full frame.  The lost_full_frames is equivalent to the number
      of full frames lost in the above sequence number interval.

   Number of partial frames lost (lost_partial_frames): 32 bits

      If one frame is partially lost, this frame is regarded as one lost
      fractional frame.  The value of the lost_partial_frames field is
      equivalent to the number of partial frames lost in the above
      sequence number interval.



5.  SDP Signaling

   RFC 3611 defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

5.1.  SDP rtcp-xr-attrib Attribute Extension

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 by providing three additional values of
   "xr-format" to signal the use of the report block defined in this
   document.

            xr-format = / burst-gap-loss-stat
                        / burst-gap-discard-stat
                        / frame-impairment-stat
    Burst-gap-loss-stat ="burst gap loss summary statistics"
    Burst-gap-discard-stat="burst gap discard summary statistics"
    Frame-impairment-stat="frame impairment summary statistics"

5.2.  Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in offer-answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in Section 5.2 of RFC 3611 applies.


6.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to RFC
   3611.

6.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type values

   This document assigns three new block type value in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry:

6.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameters

   This document also registers three new SDP [RFC4566] parameters for
   the "rtcp-xr" attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry:

    *  " burst-gap-loss-stat "
    *  " burst-gap-discard-stat "
    *  " frame-impairment-stat "

6.3.  Contact information for registrations

   The contact information for the registrations is:
