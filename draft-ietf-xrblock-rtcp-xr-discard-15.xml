    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an RTP Control Protocol(RTCP) Extended Report
      (XR) Block that allows the reporting of a simple discard count metric
      for use in a range of RTP applications.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <section title="Discard Count Report Block">
        <t>This document defines a new block type to augment those defined in
        <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> for use in a range of RTP applications.
        The new block type supports the reporting of the number of packets
        which are received correctly but are never played out, typically
        because they arrive too late to be played out (buffer underflow) or
        too early (buffer overflow). The metric is applicable both to systems
        which use packet loss repair techniques (such as forward error
        correction <xref target="RFC5109"></xref> or retransmission <xref
        target="RFC4588"></xref>) and to those which do not.</t>

        <t>This metric is useful for identifying the existence, and
        characterizing the severity, of a packet transport problem which may
        affect users' perception of a service delivered over RTP.</t>

        <t>This block may be used in conjunction with <xref
        target="BGDISCARD"></xref> which provides additional information on
        the pattern of discarded packets. However the metric in <xref
        target="BGDISCARD"></xref> may be used independently of the metrics in
        this block.</t>

        <t>When a Discard Count Metrics Block is sent together with a Burst
        Gap Discard Metrics Block (defined in <xref target="BGDISCARD"></xref>
        ) to the media sender or RTP based network management system, the
        information carried in the Discard Count Metrics Block and the Burst
        Gap Discard Metrics Block allows systems receiving the blocks to
        calculate burst gap summary statistics (e.g., the gap discard
        rate).</t>

        <t>The metric belongs to the class of transport-related end system
        metrics defined in <xref target="RFC6792"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="RTCP and RTCP XR Reports">
        <t>The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref>. <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> defined an
        extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended Report (XR).
        This document defines a new Extended Report block for use with <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Performance Metrics Framework">
        <t>The Performance Metrics Framework <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>
        provides guidance on the definition and specification of performance
        metrics. The RTP Monitoring Architectures <xref
        target="RFC6792"></xref> provides guideline for reporting block format
        using RTCP XR. The metrics block described in this document are in
        accordance with the guidelines in <xref target="RFC6390"></xref> and
        <xref target="RFC6792"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>This metric is believed to be applicable to a large class of RTP
        applications which use a de-jitter buffer [RFC5481].</t>

        <t>Discards due to late or early arriving packets affects user
        experience. The reporting of discards alerts senders and other
        receivers to the need to adjust their transmission or reception
        strategies. The reports allow network managers to diagnose these user
        experience problems.</t>

        <t>The ability to detect duplicate packets can be used by managers to
        detect network layer or sender behavior which may indicate network or
        device issues. Based on the reports, these issues may be addressed
        prior to any impact on user experience.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <section title="Standards Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>In addition, the following terms are defined:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Received, Lost and Discarded"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />A packet shall be regarded as lost if it fails to
            arrive within an implementation-specific time window. A packet
            that arrives within this time window but is either too early to be
            played out or too late to be played out or thrown away before
            playout due to packet duplication or redundancy shall be regarded
            as discarded. A packet shall not be regarded as discarded if it
            arrives within this time window but is dropped during decoding by
            some higher layer decoder, e.g., due to a decoding error. A packet
            shall be classified as one of received (or OK), discarded or lost.
            The Discard Count Metric counts only discarded packets. The metric
            "cumulative number of packets lost" defined in <xref
            target="RFC3550"></xref> reports a count of packets lost from the
            media stream (single Synchronization source (SSRC) within single
            RTP session). Similarly the metric "number of packets discarded"
            reports a count of packets discarded from the media stream (single
            SSRC within single RTP session) arriving at the receiver. Another
            metric defined in <xref target="RFC5725"></xref> is available to
            report on packets which are not recovered by any repair techniques
            which may be in use. <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Discard Count Metric Report Block">
      <t>Metrics in this block report on the number of packets discarded in
      the stream arriving at the RTP end system. The measurement of these
      metrics is made at the receiving end of the RTP stream. Instances of
      this metrics block refer by SSRC to the separate auxiliary Measurement
      Information Block <xref target="RFC6776"></xref> which describes
      measurement Intervals in use. This metrics block relies on the
      measurement interval in the Measurement Information Block indicating the
      span of the report and MUST be sent in the same compound RTCP packet as
      the measurement information block. If the measurement interval is not
      received in the same compound RTCP packet as this metrics block, this
      metrics block MUST be discarded.</t>

                metrics reports.</t>

                <t>I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to
                the accumulation period characteristic of cumulative
                measurements.</t>

                <t>I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled
                instantaneous value.</t>
              </list>In this document, the Discard Count Metric can only be
            measured over definite intervals, and cannot be sampled.
            Accordingly, the value I=01, indicating a sampled value, MUST NOT
            be sent, and MUST be discarded when received. In addition, the
            value I=00 is reserved and also MUST NOT be sent, and MUST be

            future definition and MUST NOT be Sent,and MUST be discarded when
            received.<vspace blankLines="1" />An endpoint MAY report any
            combination of discard types in each reporting interval by
            including several Discard Count Metric Report Blocks in a single
            RTCP XR packet.<vspace blankLines="1" />Some systems send
            duplicate RTP packets for robustness or error resilience. This is
            NOT RECOMMENDED since it breaks RTCP packet statistics. If
            duplication is desired for error resilience, the mechanism
            described in <xref target="RTPDUP"></xref> can be used, since this
            will not cause breakage of RTP streams or RTCP statistics.<vspace

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>In some situations, returning very detailed error information
      (e.g.,over-range measurement or measurement unavailable) using this
      report block can provide an attacker with insight into the security
      processing. Where this is a concern, the implementation should apply
      authentication to this report block. This can be achieved by using the
      AVPF profile together with the Secure RTP profile as defined in
      [RFC3711]; as a prerequisite, an appropriate combination of those two
      profiles (an "SAVPF") is being specified [RFC5124].</t>

      <t>Besides this, it is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block
      introduces no new security considerations beyond those described in
      <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>. This block does not provide per-packet
      statistics so the risk to confidentiality documented in Section 7,
      paragraph 3 of <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> does not apply.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for
            the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR
            packets can be signaled by an application if it employs the
            Session Description Protocol (SDP). XR packets are composed of
            report blocks, and seven block types are defined here. The purpose
            of the extended reporting format is to convey information that
            supplements the six statistics that are contained in the report
            blocks used by RTCP's Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR)
            packets. Some applications, such as multicast inference of network
            characteristics (MINC) or voice over IP (VoIP) monitoring, require
            other and more detailed statistics. In addition to the block types
            defined here, additional block types may be defined in the future
            by adhering to the framework that this document provides.</t>
