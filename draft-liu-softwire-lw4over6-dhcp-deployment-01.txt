1.  Introduction

   Lightweight 4over6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] provides IPv4 access
   over IPv6 network for hub-and-spoke softwire architecture using IPv4
   -in-IPv6 tunneling mechanism.  In Lightweight 4over6, Lightweight B4
   (lwB4) is assigned with a port-restricted IPv4 address or a full IPv4
   address.  IPv4 address and port set can be provisioned by several
   protocols.  [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] recommends to use DHCP-based
   provisioning mechanism (DHCPv4/DHCPv6).

   DHCPv4 is based on IPv4 and is unable to work in IPv6 network
   directly.  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] is a
   DHCPv4-based mechanism that supports all DHCPv4 functionality and
   transports DHCPv4 messages using DHCPv6 message.
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-v4configuration] recommends DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 as the
   best underlying approach for provisioning IPv4 parameters over an
   IPv6 only network.  Thus, DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 is the recommended IPv4
   provisioning mechanism for Lightweight 4over6.

   This document discusses how to deploy Lightweight 4over6 using DHCPv4
   over DHCPv6 as the IPv4 address provisioning protocol.  It mainly
   focus on the deployment scenarios and binding table maintaining
   issues.

2.  Terminology

   Terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] and
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is used extensively in this document.

3.  Deployment Modes Consideration

   Lightweight 4over6 can be deployed in two modes, Dynamic Mode and
   Static Mode, according to how the binding table in lwAFTR is
   maintained.  This section discusses when and why

   There are 3 basic elements to serve a lwB4: IPv6 address of lwB4,
   IPv4 address (and port set) of lwB4, and a binding record in lwAFTR
   which maps the IPv6 address and IPv4 address (and port set) of lwB4.

3.1.  Dynamic Mode

   In Dynamic Mode, the binding table in lwAFTR is maintained
   dynamically through address provisioning process.  lwB4's IPv6 and
   IPv4 addresses are decoupled, and lwB4 is free to use any IPv6
   address.  Due to the lack of IPv4 addresses, IPv4 address (and port
   set) is provisioned dynamically in a stateful manner.  Once an IPv4
   address (and port set) is allocated to a lwB4, a binding record is
   added or updated to the binding table in lwAFTR.

3.2.  Static Mode

   In Static Mode, the binding table in lwAFTR is predetermined and not
   changed by provisioning process, so the binding record for a lwB4 is
   generated before address provisioning process.  According to the
   order of IPv6/IPv4 provisioning, there are 2 possible cases:

   Case 1: lwB4 is provisioned with an IPv4 address (and port set)
   dynamically.  After IPv4 provisioning, lwB4's IPv6 address is
   determined by its IPv4 address (and port set) and the binding record.

   Case 2: lwB4 is provisioned with an IPv6 address or IPv6 prefix
   dynamically.  After IPv6 provisioning, lwB4's IPv4 address (and port
   set) is determined by its IPv6 address/prefix and the binding record
   statically.

3.3.  Summary of the Modes

   In Dynamic Mode and Case 1 of Static Mode, IPv4 address (and port
   set) is provisioned to lwB4 in a stateful manner (i.e., provisioned
   with a lease time).  It is natively supported by DHCPv4-based
   mechanism, so DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 is a suitable solution in these
   cases.

Internet-Draft   lw4over6 deployment with DHCPv4oDHCPv6     October 2013


   In Case 2 of Static Mode, IPv4 address (and port set) is provisioned
   in a stateless manner.  Although it is not the native usage of
   DHCPv4, DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 can support this case by some simple
   updates.

   Besides DHCPv4-based provisioning method, DHCPv6-based method can be
   used to provision IPv4 address as well.  [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp]
   defines new DHCPv6 options to support provisioning of IPv4 address
   and ports.  Currently it only supports stateless provisioning, so it
   can only be used in Case 2 of Static Mode.  IPv4 lease time
   information in necessary for IPv4 stateful provisioning, but to
   importing IPv4 lease time into DHCPv6 may make it too complicated.

4.  Deployment Considerations

4.1.  General Considerations

   In Static Mode, the binding table in lwAFTR is predetermined and is
   not affected by IPv4 provisioning process.  In Dynamic Mode, the
   binding table is maintained through IPv4 provisioning process, so
   lwAFTR must be informed about the DHCP provisioning events.  There
   are two methods to support this: (1) DHCP server pushes the changes
   to lwAFTR, or (2) lwAFTR locates in the path of the DHCP process.  In
   this document, we choose method (2) and require lwAFTR to be co-
   located with either a DHCP 4o6 Server, or a DHCPv6 relay agent which
   is on the link from the DHCP client to the 4o6 Server.

   When lwAFTR is the next-hop of lwB4, it's meaningless to set up IPv4
   -in-IPv6 tunnel between lwB4 and lwAFTR, so we ignore this case in
   this document.

4.2.  lwB4 Consideration

   When deploying Lightweight 4over6 with DHCPv4 over DHCPv6, lwB4 MUST
   implement DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 client function as is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6].

   lwB4/DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 client sends BOOTREQUESTV6 message to either
   the well-known multicast address or directly to the 4o6 Server's IPv6
   address in order to obtain IPv4 address.  When lwB4/DHCPv4-over-
   DHCPv6 client uses multicast to send BOOTREQUESTV6 message, the
   service provider MUST deploy a DHCPv6 relay agent which is an one-hop
   neighbor of lwB4 to relay DHCPv6 messages.  If the DHCP 4o6 Server is
   not used as lwB4's DHCPv6 server, the relay agent SHOULD be updated
   to support the separation of 4o6 Server and DHCPv6 only server as
   described in section 7 of [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6].

   When lwB4/DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 client sends BOOTREQUESTV6 message using

   unicast, it MUST obtain the IPv6 address of the DHCP 4o6 Server
   before the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 process.  This address SHOULD be
   conveyed by OPTION_4O6_SERVERS defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6].

   DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 does not prohibit a client without any global IPv6
   address to obtain IPv4 address by using multicast.  However, the
   binding table in AFTR can not be updated if the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6
   packet does not contain lwB4's global IPv6 address, so lwB4 must
   obtain global IPv6 address before it starts DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6
   process.

4.3.  lwAFTR Consideration

   When a lwAFTR is co-located with DHCP 4o6 Server or DHCPv6 relay
   agent, it MUST examine all DHCPv6 messages it received and extract
   the DHCPv4 message from the BOOTP Message Option in each
   BOOTREQUESTV6 and BOOTREPLYV6 message.

   When the DHCPv6 message is a BOOTREPLYV6 message and DHCPv4 message
   is a DHCPACK message, lwAFTR uses the IPv4 address and port set in
   the DHCPACK message and the global IPv6 address of lwB4 to create a
   new record in the binding table or update an existing record.  When
   the DHCPv6 message is a BOOTREQUESTV6 message and DHCPv4 message is a
   DHCPRELEASE message, lwAFTR uses the IPv4 address and port set in the
   DHCPRELEASE message and the global IPv6 address of lwB4 to remove
   record(s) in the binding table.

4.4.  Carrying lwB4's IPv6 address

   The lwB4 is expected to send the BOOTREQUESTV6 message using the
   lwB4's global IPv6 address, so that lwAFTR can update the binding
   table with this information.  When lwB4 sends BOOTREQUESTV6 message
   by unicast, the source address of the packet can be used as the
   client's global IPv6 address.  However, this can not be achieved when
   lwB4 sends BOOTREQUESTV6 message by multicast because Section 16 of
   [RFC3315] defines that the DHCP client must use a link-local address
   when using multicast.

   There are two possible solutions for this problem: (1) force lwB4/
   DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 client not to use multicast, or (2) Put a DHCPv6
   option which contains the global IPv6 address of lwB4 into the
   BOOTREQUESTV6 message.

   We recommend solution (2) as the address carrying method to fit more
   deployment scenarios.  The DHCPv6 option to be used may be an
   existing option or a new defined option.

5.  lwAFTR Deployment Models in Dynamic Mode

   As discussed in Section 4.1, in Dynamic Mode lwAFTR is required to be
   located in the path of the DHCP process.  Therefor there are 3
   possible models of the deployment of lwAFTR:

      Model 1: lwAFTR is co-located with DHCP 4o6 Server as well as the
      DHCPv4 server engine of the 4o6 Server

      Model 2: lwAFTR is co-located with DHCPv6 relay agent

      Model 3: lwAFTR is co-located with DHCP 4o6 Server's v6 part, and
      the DHCPv4 server engine is a separate device

   When a service provider deploys multiple lwAFTRs, he may have the
   requirement of sharing one DHCP 4o6 server among multiple lwAFTRs.
   Model 2 and Model 3 supports this usage.

5.1.  Model 1

   In Model 1, lwAFTR is co-located with a complete DHCP 4o6 Server.
   Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of this model.

   The lwB4, as a DHCP client, can send the BOOTREQUESTV6 message using
   multicast as is described in [RFC3315].  The packets may be relayed
   toward the lwAFTR/4o6 Server.

   When lwB4 uses unicast to send BOOTREQUESTV6 message, it employs the
   IPv6 address conveyed through the 4o6 Servers Address Option
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6].  The IPv6 address is that of the
   lwAFTR/4o6 Server.

   In Model 2, lwAFTR is co-located with a DHCPv6 relay agent.  It is
   configured with the 4o6 Server's IPv6 address as the destination
   address.  Figure 2 illustrates the architecture of this model.

   When lwB4 uses multicast to send BOOTREQUESTV6 message, the one-hop
   neighbor relay agent is configured with the IPv6 address of the
   lwAFTR/relay agent and relays DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 packages to lwAFTR/
   relay agent.

   When lwB4 uses unicast to send BOOTREQUESTV6 message, the destination
   address it obtains is the lwAFTR's/relay agent's IPv6 address.

                             Figure 2: Model 2

5.3.  Model 3

   In Model 3, lwAFTR is co-located with a DHCP 4o6 Server, but the
   DHCPv4 server engine of the 4o6 Server is a separate device.  Figure
   3 illustrates the architecture of this model.  The behavior of lwB4
   and one-hop neighbor relay agent is the same as that in Model 1.

   Section 8 of [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] describes that the
   DHCPv4 server engine can be a separate DHCPv4 server instance, but
   does not provide how to implement that and how a 4o6 Server
   communicates with the engine.  In this model we suggest the DHCPv4
   server engine to be a regular standalone DHCPv4 server.
