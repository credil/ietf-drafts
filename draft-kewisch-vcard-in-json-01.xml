      <t>This specification defines "jCard", a JSON format for vCard data.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>
        The vCard data format <xref target='RFC6350'/> has gone through
        multiple revisions, most recently vCard 4. The goal followed by this
        format is the capture and exchange of information normally stored
        within an address book or directory application. As certain similarities
        to the iCalendar data format <xref target='RFC5545'/> exist it makes
        sense to define a JSON-based data format for vCards that is similar to
        the jCal format defined in <xref target='I-D.kewisch-et-al-icalendar-in-json'/>.
      </t>

      <t>
        The purpose of this specification is to define "jCard", a JSON format 
        for vCard data. One main advantage to using a JSON-based format as
        defined in <xref target='RFC4627'/> over the classic vCard format is
        easier processing for JavaScript based widgets and libraries, especially
        in the scope of web-based applications.
      </t>
        
      <t>
        The key design considerations are essentially the same as those for 
        <xref target='I-D.kewisch-et-al-icalendar-in-json'/> and
        <xref target='RFC6321'/>, that is:
        <list>
          <t>
            Round-tripping (converting a vCard instance to jCard and back) will
            give the same semantic result as the starting point. For example,
            all components, properties and property parameters are guaranteed to
            be preserved, with the exception of those which have default values.
          </t>
          <t>
            Ordering of elements will not necessarily be preserved. 
          </t>
          <t>
            Preserve the semantics of the vCard data. While a simple consumer
            can easily browse the data in jCard, a full understanding
            of vCard is still required in order to modify and/or fully
            comprehend the directory data.
          </t>
          <t>
            Ability to handle many extensions to the underlying vCard 
            specification without requiring an update to this document.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title='Conventions Used in This Document'>
      <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
        document are to be interpreted as described in 
        <xref target='RFC2119' />.
      </t>

      <t>
        The underlying format used for jCard is JSON. Consequently, the terms
        "object" and "array" as well as the four primitive types are to be
        interpreted as described in Section 1 of <xref target="RFC4627"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
        Some examples in this document contain "partial" JSON documents used 
        for illustrative purposes. In these examples, three periods "..." are 
        used to indicate a portion of the document that has been removed for 
        compactness.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='Converting from vCard to jCard'>
      <t>
        This section describes how vCard data is converted to jCard using a 
        simple mapping between the vCard data model and JSON elements.
      </t>

      <section title="Pre-processing">
        <t>
          vCard uses a line folding mechanism to limit lines of data to a 
          maximum line length (typically 72 characters) to ensure maximum 
          likelihood of preserving data integrity as it is transported via 
          various means (e.g., email) - see Section 3.2 of <xref target='RFC6350'/>. 
          Prior to converting vCard data into jCard all folded lines MUST be 
          unfolded.
        </t>

        <t>
          vCard data uses an "escape" character sequence for text values and 
          property parameter values. When such text elements are converted into 
          jCard the escaping MUST be removed. See Section 3.4 of
          <xref target='RFC6350'/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          One key difference in the formatting of values used in vCard and 
          jCard is that in jCard the specification uses date/time
          values aligned with the complete representation, extended format of
          <xref target="ISO.8601.2004"/>.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="vCard Stream">
        <t>
          In certain cases it makes sense to group a sequence of vcard objects
          into a stream of objects. While the vCard 4 standard doesn't define a
          stream of vcard objects, having one makes it easier to identify
          multiple jCard objects and also ensures compatibility to jCal. A jCard
          stream is identified by an array, where the first element is the
          string "vcardstream". Subsequent elements are vCard objects
          represented as described in this document.
        </t>

        <t>
          In the typical case where there is only one vCard object,
          encapsulation inside a "vcardstream" array MAY be omitted.
        </t>

        <t>
          A vCard stream can contain one or more vCard objects. Each vCard
          object, delimited by "BEGIN:VCARD" and "END:VCARD", is
          represented in JSON as a fixed length array with two elements:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>The string "vcard"</t>
            <t>An array of jCard properties</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          The representation of a vCard object in JSON will be named
          "vcard component" throughout this document.
        </t>

        </t>

        <t>
          vCard objects are comprised of a set of "properties", "parameters" and
          "values". The top level of a vCard object contains "properties". A
          "property" has a "value" and a set of zero or more "parameters".
          vCard objects are delimited by the general properties "BEGIN" and
          "END" with the fixed value "VCARD" as defined in Section 6.1.1 and
          6.1.2 of <xref target='RFC6350'/>. In addition, the vCard format is
          versioned, therefore the "version" property is mandatory. To comply
          with Section 6.7.9 of <xref target='RFC6350'/>, the value of the
          version property MUST be "4.0".
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="properties" title="Properties (RFC6350 section 6)">
        <t>
          Each individual vCard property is represented in jCard by an array
          with three fixed elements, followed by one or more additional
          elements, depending on if the property is a multi-value property as
          described in Section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC6350"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          The array consists of the following fixed elements:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              The name of the property as a string, but in lowercase.
            </t>
            <t>
              An object containing the parameters as described in
              <xref target="parameters"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
              The type identifier string of the value, in lowercase.
            </t>
          </list>

          The remaining elements of the array are used for the value of the
          property.  For single-value properties, the array MUST have exactly
          four elements, for multi-valued properties as described in
          <xref target="multivalue"/> there can be any number of additional
          elements.
        </t>

        <t>
          The array describing the property can then be inserted into the array
          designated for properties in the "vcard" component.
        </t>

        </t>

        <t>
          The property parameters in the second element of the property array
          associate a set of parameter names with their respective value.
          Parameters are further described in <xref target="parameters"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          To allow for a cleaner implementation, the parameter object MUST be
          present even if there are no parameters. In this case, an empty
          object MUST be used.

              Various vCard properties defined in <xref target="RFC6350"/>,

              multi-valued properties.  In jCal these properties are added as
              further members of the array describing the property.
            </t>
            <t>
              Note that additional multi-valued properties may be added in
              extensions to the iCalendar format.

            <t>
              <xref target='RFC6350'/> Section 3.3 defines a grouping construct
              that is used to group related properties together. In jCard, each
              grouped property appears as a separate property containing the group
              name and property name, separated by a "." character. This was done
              to maintain compatibilty of array elements with
              <xref target='I-D.kewisch-et-al-icalendar-in-json'/>.

          Property parameters are represented as a JSON object where each
          key-value pair represents the vCard parameter name and its value.
          The name of the parameter MUST be in lowercase, the original case of
          the parameter value MUST be preserved. For example, the "LANG"
          property parameter is represented in jCard by the "lang" key.  Any
          new vCard parameters added in the future will be converted in the
          same way.

        <section title="VALUE parameter">
          <t>
            vCard defines a "VALUE" property parameter (Section 5.2 of
            <xref target='RFC6350'/>). This property parameter MUST NOT be
            added to the parameters object. Instead, the value type is always
            explicitly mentioned in the third element of the array describing
            the property. Thus, when converting from vCard to jCard, any "VALUE"
            property parameters are skipped. When converting from jCard into
            vCard, the appropriate "VALUE" property parameter MUST be included
            in the vCard property if the value type is not the default value
            type for that property.

        <section title="Multi-value Parameters">
          <t>
            In <xref target='RFC6350'/>, some parameters allow using a
            COMMA-separated list of values. To ease processing in jCard, the
            value to such parameters MUST be represented in an array containing
            the separated values. The array elements MUST be string values.
            Single-value parameters SHOULD be represented using a single string
            value, but an array with one element MAY also be used. An example
            for a such parameter is the vCard "SORT-AS" parameter, more such
            parameters may be added in extensions.
          </t>

          <t>
            DQUOTE characters used to encapsulate the separated values MUST NOT
            be added to the jCard parameter value.

        <t>
          vCard extension properties and property parameters (those with an
          "X-" prefix in their name) are handled in the same way as other
          properties and property parameters: the property is represented by an
          array, the property parameter represented by an object. The property
          or parameter name uses the same name as for the vCard extension,
          but in lowercase. For example, the "X-FOO" property in vCard
          turns into the "x-foo" jCard property. See <xref target="unrecognized"/>
          for how to deal with default values for unrecognized extension
          properties or property parameters.
        </t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Converting from jCard into vCard">
      <t>
        When converting property and property parameter values, the
        names SHOULD be converted to uppercase. Although vCard names are
        case insensitive, common practice is to keep them all uppercase
        following the actual definitions in <xref target="RFC6350"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
        Backslash escaping and line folding MUST be applied to the resulting
        vCard data as required by <xref target="RFC6350"/>.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        When converting to vCard, the VALUE parameter MUST be added to
        properties whose default value type is unknown. The VALUE parameter
        SHOULD NOT be added to properties using the default value type.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Handling Unrecognized Properties or Parameters" anchor="unrecognized">
      <t>
        In vCard, properties have a default value type specified by their
        definition, e.g. "BDAY"'s value type is "date-and-or-time", but it can
        also be reset to a single "text" value.  When a property uses its
        default value type, the "VALUE" property parameter does not need to be
        specified on the property.
      </t>

      <t>
        When new properties are defined or "X-" properties used, a vCard
        to jCard converter might not recognize them, and not know what the
        appropriate default value types are, yet they need to be able to
        preserve the values. A similar issue arises for unrecognized property
        parameters. As a result, the following rules are applied when dealing
        with unrecognized properties and property parameters:

                Any property that does not include a "VALUE" property parameter

                string object. The content of that string is the unprocessed
                value text.
              </t>

              <t>
                Any unrecognized property parameter MUST be converted to a string

              <t>

            <xref target='RFC6350'/> doesn't define any kind of stream for
            multiple vcard elements. For similarity with the jCal draft, I have
            added a "vcardstream". Is this wanted and does the name fit? (Maybe
            rather "jcardstream" ?)
          </t>
          <t>
            During conversion to jCard, I have dropped "date-and-or-time" and
            "timestamp" formats, since they can equally be represented by the
            formats "date", "time" and "date-time". I have added guidelines to
            <xref target="convert-datetime"/>, but there may be some situations
            I am unaware of that make dropping these formats impossible.
          </t>
          <t>
            This document defines in <xref target="grouping"/>, that grouped
            properties are not to be handled differently than normal properties.
            This was done for compatibility with the jCal draft to make it
            easier for a parser to support both jCal and jCard.
            Another option would be to add a pseudo-property with the special
            type "group", the property name being the group name and the
            property value being an array of properties. Downside is that there
            is room for an extra set of parameters in the group container that
            does not serialize back to vCard.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            There is some open discussion on the vcarddav and calsify lists
            about structured property and parameter values. The origin of this
            format comes from jCal, where structured values are very rare and
            processing the remaining ones requires a processing library anyway.
            Therefore neither structured property values nor parameter values
            were added. For jCard on the other hand, structured values appear
            quite often. I have come up with three possible options for
            structured property values:
            <list style="numbers">
              <t>
                Use an array as the value, possibly with a null value for any
                empty structured property: foo;;bar becomes ["foo", null,
                "bar"]
              </t>
              <t>
                Use an object for key-value combinations. Downside is that the
                key may not always be known, and needs to be defined at least
                for standard properties. (i.e for N: "surnames", "given",
                "additional", "honor-prefix", "honor-suffix"). Object values
                themselves could also be array values, i.e multiple honorific
                prefixes. Upside is that it makes it very easy to access the
                values even without using a dedicated client library.
              </t>
              <t>
                Keep the property value as an opaque text and leave any
                splitting to client libraries. This makes it very simple to
                parse both iCalendar and vCard data into a similar format, but
                puts the burden of parsing the structured value on the client or
                client library.
              </t>
            </list>

            Also, there should be a mention of how multi-values inside a
            structured value should be handled. With the second approach, these
            could themselves be an array, similar to how this document currently
            defines multi-value parameters.
