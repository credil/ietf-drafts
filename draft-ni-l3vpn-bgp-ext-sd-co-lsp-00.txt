Abstract

   In some large scale L3VPN deployment scenarios like mobile backhaul
   network, it is required that tunnels between two PEs could be setup
   automatically driven by L3VPN service to reduce manual configuration
   effort. Moreover the tunnels must be setup co-routed for the
   goodness of performance monitoring and uniform protection behavior
   for link failure on two directions. This is described in [I-D.li-
   mpls-serv-driven-co-lsp-fmwk]. This document introduces a new
   BGP VT route based on [I-D.ni-bgp-ext-l3vpn-pm]. The route is 
   utilized by on side PE to advertise Tunnel ID to other side PE,
   so inverse direction co-routed LSPs can be setup based on path
   information of member LSPs in the first tunnel.

Internet-Draft BGP Extension for Carry LSP ID In L3VPN       July 2013


1. Introduction

   In some large scale L3VPN deployment scenarios like mobile backhaul
   network, it is required that LSPs between two PEs could be setup
   automatically driven by L3VPN service to reduce manual configuration
   effort and the LSPs must be setup co-routed for the goodness of
   performance monitoring and uniform protection behavior under link
   failure, which is in detail described in [I-D.li-mpls-serv-driven-
   co-lsp-fmwk].

   This document introduces a new BGP Tunnel-ID Signal Route under VT
   SAFI([I-D.ni-bgp-ext-l3vpn-pm]). After VPN-membership discovered 
   one PE can use the route to proactively advertise one direction 
   MPLS TE Tunnel ID to remote PE, the latter can setup inverse 
   direction co-routed LSPs based on path information of member LSPs 
   of the first tunnel. For RSVP-TE type LSP, the path information
   could be got from RRO naturally.

   The extension is based on VT SAFI defined in [I-D.ni-bgp-ext-l3vpn-
   pm].

   Type 1(VT VPN Membership A-D Route) is utilized to support VPN-
   membership auto-discovery between a pair of VRFs.

   A new Type 3 VT Route, namely VT Tunnel-ID Signal Route, is defined
   in this document.

5. Operations

5.1. Active/Passive PE Selection

   For a pair of PEs which are going to exchange VT Tunnel-ID Signal
   Routes need to select Active PE/Passive PE first. The selection
   SHOULD be done by two ways:

   a) Locally decided by manually configuration. That is one PE is
      configured as Active PE and other PE is configured as Passive PE.

   b) Doing auto-selection in BGP's Capability Negotiation phase. Router
      IDs of the two PEs are compared as unsigned integers, the PE with
      larger Router ID value MUST be selected as Active PE and the PE
      with smaller Router ID value is selected as Passive PE.

5.2. VPN Membership Auto Discovery

   Following the detailed description in [I-D.ni-bgp-ext-l3vpn-pm],
   all PEs firstly need to send VT VPN A-D Routes to do VPN membership 
   discovery.

5.3. Active PE Advertise VT Tunnel-ID Signal Route

   Once found a pair of VRFs between Active PE and Passive PE belongs
   to the same VPN, Active PE MUST initialize setup a RSVP-TE tunnel to
   Passive PE for the pair of VRFs. Once Tunnel ID is allocated locally,
   Active PE MUST advertise the RSVP TE tunnel info to Passive PE by
   using VT Tunnel-ID Signal Route:

   Local VRF's RD: MUST be filled with Route Distinguisher value of the
   Local VRF.

   Local Router's IP Address: MUST be filled with Active PE's IPv4/IPv6
   Address.

   Remote VRF's RD: MUST be filled with Route Distinguisher value of
   the remote VRF on Passive PE which belongs to same L3VPN with Local
   VRF.

   Remote Router's IP Address: MUST be filled with Passive PE's
   IPv4/IPv6 Address.

   Tunnel Type: MUST be filled with a valid Tunnel Type value, for
   example filled with value <1> which indicates RSVP-TE Tunnel.

   Flags: the high-order 7 bits MUST be filled with ZERO and "R" bit
   flag MUST be filled with value <1> which indicates the tunnel is
   initialized by Active PE.

   Tunnel ID: <IP tunnel end point address> field MUST be filled with
   IP address of Passive PE, <Tunnel ID> field MUST be filled with the
   Tunnel Identifier value allocated by Active PE, <Extended Tunnel ID>
   filed MUST be filled with ZERO or IP address of Active PE.

   Note that if tunnel goes down, the responding VT Tunnel-ID Signal
   Route Withdrawal message SHOULD NOT be sent out.

5.4. Passive PE advertise Tunnel ID to Active PE

   After receiving VT Tunnel-ID Signal Route from Active PE, Passive PE
   gets all LSP's path information under the Tunnel and setup inverse
   direction RSVP-TE LSPs following same path.

Internet-Draft BGP Extension for Carry LSP ID In L3VPN       July 2013


   Once Tunnel ID is allocated locally, the Tunnel ID information MUST
   be advertised from Passive PE to Active PE through VT Tunnel-ID
   Signal Route:

   Local VRF's RD: MUST be filled with Route Distinguisher value of the
   Local VRF on Passive PE.

   Local Router's IP Address: MUST be filled with Passive PE's
   IPv4/IPv6 Address.

   Remote VRF's RD: MUST be filled with Route Distinguisher value of
   the remote VRF on Active PE which belongs to same L3VPN with Local
   VRF.

   Remote Router's IP Address: MUST be filled with Active PE's
   IPv4/IPv6 Address.

   Tunnel Type: MUST be filled with a valid Tunnel Type value, usually
   the tunnel Type SHOULD be same with previous Tunnel Type setup by
   Active PE.

   Flags: Filled "R"  Flag with value "0" which indicates the tunnel is
   setup by Passive PE.

   Tunnel ID: "IPv4 tunnel end point address" field MUST be filled with
   IP address of Active PE, "Tunnel ID" field MUST be filled with the
   Tunnel Identifier value allocated by Passive PE, "Extended Tunnel ID"
   MUST be filled with ZERO or IP Address of Passive PE.

5.5. VT Tunnel-ID Signal Route Application

   When Active PE and Passive PE learnt VT Tunnel-ID Signal Routes from
   each other, both PEs need binding two uni-direction Tunnels together
   for the L3VPN. It means L3VPN traffic is transit over the tunnels
   and that if Active PE changes LSP in Active Tunnel, Passive PE MUST
   detect it and manipulate the reverse direction LSP in Passive Tunnel
   accordingly through RSVP protocol.

6. VT Tunnel-ID Signal Route Selection Consideration

   VT Tunnel-ID Signal Route SHOULD follow the BGP best route selection
   procedure described in [RFC4271].

   VT Tunnel-ID Signal Route MUST be advertised ONLY to the Peer from
   which the best VT VPN A-D route is received. VT VPN A-D route is the
   one which carries the same Remote VRF's RD value and Remote PE's IP
   address

Internet-Draft BGP Extension for Carry LSP ID In L3VPN       July 2013


   If Peer receives VT Tunnel-ID Signal Route originated from itself,
   the route MUST be ignored.

7. Deployment Consideration

   This document currently supports deploying VT Tunnel-ID Signal Route
   in 2 manners:

   Inner-AS L3VPN: with Full-mesh IBGP sessions or Router Reflectors.

   Inter-AS L3VPN: with Option A (VRF-to-VRF)[RFC4364].

   How to support Inter-AS L3VPN Option B(MP-EBGP) [RFC4364] and
   Option-C (Multi-Hop MP-EBGP) [RFC4364] will be described in this
   draft's future version.

8. Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues.
