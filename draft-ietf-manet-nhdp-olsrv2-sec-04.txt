      Integrity Protection for Control Messages in NHDP and OLSRv2
                  draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-olsrv2-sec-04

Abstract

   This document specifies integrity and replay protection for the MANET
   Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) and the Optimized Link State
   Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).  This protection is achieved by
   using an HMAC-SHA-256 Integrity Check Value (ICV) TLV and a timestamp
   TLV based on POSIX time.

   The mechanism in this specification can also be used for other
   protocols that use the generalized packet/message format described in
   RFC 5444.

   This document updates RFC 6130 and RFC xxxx by mandating the
   implementation of this integrity and replay protection in NHDP and
   OLSRv2.

Internet-Draft  Integrity Protection for NHDP and OLSRv2     August 2013


1.  Introduction

   [RFC Editor note: Please replace "xxxx" throughout this document with
   the RFC number assigned to [OLSRv2], and remove this note.]

   This specification updates [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] by defining a
   framework of security mechanisms (for integrity and replay
   protection) that must be included in conforming implementations of
   those protocols (the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol, NHDP, and the
   Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2, OLSRv2).  A
   deployment of these protocols may choose to employ alternative(s) to
   these mechanisms, in particular it may choose to protect packets
   rather than messages, it may choose to use an alternative integrity
   check value (ICV) with preferred properties, and/or it may use an
   alternative timestamp.  A deployment may choose to use no such
   security mechanisms, but this is not recommended.

   The mechanisms specified are the use of an ICV for protection of the
   protocols' control messages, and the use of timestamps in those
   messages to prevent replay attacks.  Both use the TLV mechanism
   specified in [RFC5444] to add this information to the messages.
   These ICV and TIMESTAMP TLVs are defined in [RFC6622bis].  Different
   ICV TLVs are used for HELLO messages in NHDP and TC (Topology
   Control) messages in OLSRv2, the former also protecting the source
   address of the IP datagram that contains the HELLO message.  This is
   because the IP datagram source address is used by NHDP to determine
   the address of a neighbor interface, and is not necessarily otherwise
   contained in the HELLO message, while OLSRv2's TC message is
   forwarded in a new packet, and thus has no single IP datagram source
   address.

   The mechanism specified in this document is placed in the packet/
   message processing flow as indicated in Figure 1.  It exists between
   the packet parsing/generation function of [RFC5444], and the message
   processing/generation function of NHDP and OLSRv2.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses the terminology and notation of
   [RFC5444], [RFC6130], [OLSRv2], and [RFC6622bis].


3.  Applicability Statement

   [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] enable specifications of extensions to
   recognize additional reasons for rejecting a message as "badly formed



Herberg, et al.         Expires February 15, 2014               [Page 4]

   and therefore invalid for processing", and mention security
   (integrity protection) as an explicit example.  This document
   specifies a framework that provides this functionality.

   Implementations of [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] MUST include this
   framework, and deployments of [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] SHOULD use this
   framework, except for when a different security mechanism is more
   appropriate.

   The applicability of this framework is determined by its
   characteristics, which are that it:

   o  Specifies a security framework that is required to be included in
      conforming implementations of [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2].

   o  Specifies an association of ICVs with protocol messages, and
      specifies how to use a missing or invalid ICV as an reason to
      reject a message as "badly formed and therefore invalid for
      processing".

   o  Specifies the implementation of an ICV Message TLV, defined in
      [RFC6622bis], using a SHA-256 based HMAC applied to the
      appropriate message contents (and for HELLO messages also
      including the IP datagram source address).  Deployments of
      [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] using this framework SHOULD use an HMAC/
      SHA-256 ICV TLV, except when use of a different algorithm is more
      appropriate in a deployment.  An implementation MAY use more than
      one ICV TLV in a message, as long as they each use a different
      algorithm to calculate the ICV.

   o  Specifies the implementation of a TIMESTAMP Message TLV, defined
      in [RFC6622bis], to provide message replay protection.
      Deployments of [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] using this framework SHOULD
      use a POSIX time based timestamp, if the clocks in all routers in
      the network can be synchronized with sufficient precision.

   o  Assumes that a router that is able to generate correct integrity
      check values is considered trusted.

   This framework does not:

   o  Specify which key identifiers are to be used in a MANET in which
      the routers share more than one secret key.  (Such keys will be
      differentiated using the <key-id> field defined in an ICV TLV in
      [RFC6622bis].)

   o  Specify how to distribute cryptographic material (shared secret
      key(s)).

Internet-Draft  Integrity Protection for NHDP and OLSRv2     August 2013


   o  Specify how to detect compromised routers with valid keys.

   o  Specify how to handle (revoke) compromised routers with valid
      keys.


4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning

   The framework specified in this document provides the following
   functionalities for use with messages specified by [RFC6130] and
   [OLSRv2]:

   o  Generation of ICV Message TLVs (as defined in [RFC6622bis]) for
      inclusion in an outgoing message.  An implementation of [RFC6130]
      and [OLSRv2] MAY use more than one ICV TLV in a message, even with
      the same type extension, but these ICV TLVs MUST each use a
      different algorithm to calculate the ICV, e.g., with different
      hash and/or cryptographic functions when using type extension 1 or
      2.  An implementation of [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] MUST at least be
      able to generate an ICV TLV using HMAC/SHA-256 and one or more
      secret keys shared by all routers.

   o  Generation of TIMESTAMP Message TLVs (as defined in [RFC6622bis])
      for inclusion in an outgoing message.  An implementation of
      [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] MAY use more than one ICV TLV in a message,
      but MUST NOT use the same type extension.  An implementation of
      [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] that is able to synchronize the clocks in
      all routers in the network with sufficient precision, MUST at
      least be able to generate a TIMESTAMP TLV using POSIX time.

   o  Verification of ICV Message TLVs contained in a message, in order
      to determine if this message MUST be rejected as "badly formed and
      therefore invalid for processing" [RFC6130] [OLSRv2].  An
      implementation of [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] MUST at least be able to
      verify an ICV TLV using HMAC/SHA-256 and one or more secret keys
      shared by all routers.

   o  Verification of TIMESTAMP Message TLVs (as defined in
      [RFC6622bis]) contained in a message, in order to determine if
      this message MUST be rejected as "badly formed and therefore
      invalid for processing" [RFC6130] [OLSRv2].  An implementation of
      [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] that is able to synchronize the clocks in
      all routers in the network with sufficient precision, MUST at
      least be able to verify a TIMESTAMP TLV using POSIX time.

   ICV Packet TLVs (as defined in [RFC6622bis]) MAY be used by a
   deployment of the multiplexing process defined in [RFC5444], either
   as well as, or instead of, the protection of the NHDP and OLSRv2



Herberg, et al.         Expires February 15, 2014               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  Integrity Protection for NHDP and OLSRv2     August 2013


   messages.  (Note that in the case of NHDP, the packet protection is
   equally good, and also protects the packet header.  In the case of
   OLSRv2, the packet protection has different properties than the
   message protection, especially for some forms of ICV.  When packets
   contain more than one message, the packet protection has lower
   overheads in space and computation time.)

   When a router generates a message on a MANET interface, this
   framework:

   o  Specifies how to calculate an integrity check value for the
      message.

   o  Specifies how to include that integrity check value using an ICV
      Message TLV.

   [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] allow for rejecting incoming messages prior to
   processing by NHDP or OLSRv2.  This framework, when used, specifies
   that a message MUST be rejected if the ICV Message TLV is absent, or
   its value cannot be verified.  Note that this means that routers
   whose implementation of NHDP and/or OLSRv2 does not include this
   specification will be ignored by routers using this framework, and
   these two sets of routers will, by design, form disjoint MANETs.
   (The unsecured MANET will retain some information about the secured
   MANET, but be unable to use it, not having any recognized symmetric
   links with the secured MANET.)


5.  Parameters

   This following router parameters are specified for use by the two
   protocols; the first is required only by NHDP, but may be visible to
   OLSRv2, the second is required only by OLSRv2:

   o  MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF - The maximum age that a HELLO message to
      be validated may have.  If the current POSIX time of the router
      validating the HELLO message, minus the timestamp indicated in the
      TIMESTAMP TLV of the HELLO message, is greater than
      MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF, the HELLO message MUST be silently
      discarded.

   o  MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF - The maximum age that a TC message to be
      validated may have.  If the current POSIX time of the router
      validating the TC message, minus the timestamp indicated in the
      TIMESTAMP TLV of the TC message, is greater than
      MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF, the TC message MUST be silently discarded.

   The following constraints apply to these parameters:



Herberg, et al.         Expires February 15, 2014               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  Integrity Protection for NHDP and OLSRv2     August 2013


   o  MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF > 0

   o  MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF > 0

   These bounds are however insufficient, MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF and
   MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF MUST be least as great as the maximum expected
   "age" of a message (i.e., the time difference between a message has
   been sent by a router and received by all intended destinations).
   For HELLO messages this needs only cover a single hop, but TC
   messages may have been forwarded a number of times.  In particular
   for TC messages, if using jitter as specified in [OLSRv2] and
   [RFC5148], the largest contribution the age may be a delay of up to
   F_MAXJITTER per hop (except the final hop) that the message has
   traveled.  Other factors in the delay of both message types, per hop,
   may include the link-layer that is used in the MANET, and CPU and
   memory resources of routers (e.g., queuing delays, and delays for
   processing ICVs).  An implementation MAY set lower and/or upper
   bounds on these parameters, if so, then these MUST allow values
   meeting these requirements.  An implementation MAY make its value of
   MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF dependent on the number of hops that a TC
   message has traveled.

   The above constraints assume ideal time synchronization of the clock
   in all routers in the network.  The parameters
   MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF and MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF (and any
   constraints on them) MAY be increased to allow for expected timing
   differences between routers (between neighboring routers for
   MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF, allowing for greater separation, but
   usually not per hop, for MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF).

   Note that excessively large values of these parameters defeats their
   objectives, so these parameters SHOULD be as large as is required,
   but not significantly larger.

   Using POSIX time allows a resolution of no more than one second.  In
   many MANET use cases, time synchronization much below one second is
   not possible because of unreliable and high-delay channels, mobility,
   interrupted communication, and possible limited resources.

   In addition, when using the default message intervals and validity
   times as specified in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2], where the shortest
   periodic message interval is 2 seconds, repeating the message within
   a second is actually beneficial rather than harmful (at a small
   bandwidth cost).  Also, the use of [RFC5148] jitter can cause a
   message to take that long or more to traverse the MANET, thus even in
   a perfectly synchronized network, the TC maximum delay would usually
   be greater than 1 second.

   A finer granulatity than 1 second, and thus the use of an alternative
   timestamp, is however RECOMMENDED in cases where, possibly due to
   fast moving routers, message validity times are below 1 second.


6.  Message Generation and Processing

   This section specifies how messages are generated and processed by
   [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] when using this framework.

6.1.  Message Content

   Messages MUST have the content specified in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2]
   respectively.  In addition, messages that conform to this framework
   will contain:

   o  At least one ICV Message TLV (as specified in [RFC6622bis]),
      generated according to Section 6.2.  Implementations of [RFC6130]
      and [OLSRv2] MUST support the following version of the ICV TLV,
      but other versions MAY be used instead, or in addition, in a
      deployment, if more appropriate:

      *  For TC messages:

         +  type-extension := 1

      *  For HELLO messages:

         +  type-extension := 2

      *  hash-function := 3 (SHA-256)

      *  cryptographic-function := 3 (HMAC)

      The ICV Value MAY be truncated as specified in [RFC6622bis]; the
      selection of an appropriate length MAY be administratively
      configured.  A message MAY contain several ICV Message TLVs.

   o  At least one TIMESTAMP Message TLV (as specified in [RFC6622bis]),
      generated according to Section 6.2.  Implementations of [RFC6130]
      and [OLSRv2] using this framework MUST support the following
      version of the TIMESTAMP TLV, but other versions MAY be used
      instead, or in addition, in a deployment, if more appropriate:

      *  type-extension := 1

6.2.  Message Generation

   After message generation (Section 11.1 of [RFC6130] and Section 16.1.
   of [OLSRv2]) and before message transmission (Section 11.2 of
   [RFC6130] and Section 16.2 of [OLSRv2]), the additional TLVs
   specified in Section 6.1 MUST (unless already present) be added to an
   outgoing message when using this framework.

   The following processing steps (when using a single timestamp version
   and a single ICV algorithm) MUST be performed for a cryptographic
   algorithm that is used for generating an ICV for a message:

   1.  All ICV TLVs (if any) are temporarily removed from the message.
       Any temporarily removed ICV TLVs MUST be stored, in order to be
       reinserted into the message in step 5.  The message size and
       Message TLV Block size are updated accordingly.

   2.  <msg-hop-count> and <msg-hop-limit>, if present, are temporarily
       set to 0.

   3.  A TLV of type TIMESTAMP, as specified in Section 6.1, is added to
       the Message TLV Block.  The message size and Message TLV block
       size are updated accordingly.

   4.  A TLV of type ICV, as specified in Section 6.1, is added to the
       Message TLV Block.  The message size and Message TLV block size
       are updated accordingly.

   5.  All ICV TLVs that were temporary removed in step 1, are restored.
       The message size and Message TLV Block size are updated
       accordingly.

   6.  <msg-hop-count> and <msg-hop-limit>, if present, are restored to
       their previous values.

   An implementation MAY add either alternative TIMESTAMP and/or ICV
   TLVs, or more than one TIMESTAMP and/or ICV TLVs.  All TIMESTAMP TLVs
   MUST be inserted before adding ICV TLVs.

6.3.  Message Processing

   Both [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] specify that:

      "On receiving a ... message, a router MUST first check if the
      message is invalid for processing by this router"

   [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] proceed to give a number of conditions that,
   each, will lead to a rejection of the message as "badly formed and

Internet-Draft  Integrity Protection for NHDP and OLSRv2     August 2013


   therefore invalid for processing".  When using a single timestamp
   version, and a single ICV algorithm, the following conditions to that
   list, each of which, if true, MUST cause NHDP or OLSRv2 (as
   appropriate) to consider the message as invalid for processing when
   using this framework:

   1.  The Message TLV Block of the message does not contain exactly one
       TIMESTAMP TLV of the selected version.  This version
       specification includes the type extension.  (The Message TLV
       Block may also contain TIMESTAMP TLVs of other versions.)

   2.  The Message TLV block does not contain exactly one ICV TLV using
       the selected algorithm and key identifier.  This algorithm
       specification includes the type extension, and for type
       extensions 1 and 2, the hash function and cryptographic function.
       (The Message TLV Block may also contain ICV TLVs using other
       algorithms and key identifiers.)

   3.  Validation of the identified (in step 1) TIMESTAMP TLV in the
       Message TLV block of the message fails, as according to
       Section 6.3.1.

   4.  Validation of the identified (in step 2) ICV TLV in the Message
       TLV block of the message fails, as according to Section 6.3.2.

   An implementation MAY check the existence of, and verify, either
   alternative TIMESTAMP and/or ICV TLVs, or more than one TIMESTAMP
   and/or ICV TLVs.

6.3.1.  Validating a Message Based on Timestamp

   For a TIMESTAMP Message TLV with type extension 1 (POSIX time)
   identified as described in Section 6.2:

   1.  If the current POSIX time minus the value of that TIMESTAMP TLV
       is greater than MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF (for a HELLO message) or
       MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF (for a TC message) then the message
       validation fails.

   2.  Otherwise, the message validation succeeds.

   If a deployment chooses to use a different type extension from 1,
   appropriate measures MUST be taken to verify freshness of the
   message.

6.3.2.  Validating a Message Based on Integrity Check

   For an ICV Message TLV identified as described in Section 6.2:

   1.  All ICV Message TLVs (including the identified ICV Message TLV)
       are temporarily removed from the message, and the message size
       and Message TLV block size are updated accordingly.

   2.  The message's <msg-hop-count> and <msg-hop-limit> fields are
       temporarily set to 0.

   3.  Calculate the integrity check value for the parameters specified
       in the identified ICV Message TLV, as specified in [RFC6622bis].

   4.  If this integrity check value differs from the value of
       <ICV-data> in the ICV Message TLV, then the message validation
       fails.  If the <ICV-data> has been truncated (as specified in
       [RFC6622bis], the integrity check value calculated in the
       previous step MUST be truncated to the TLV length of the ICV
       Message TLV before comparing it with the <ICV-data>.

   5.  Otherwise, the message validation succeeds.  The message's
       <msg-hop-count> and <msg-hop-limit> fields are restored to their
       previous value, and the ICV Message TLVs are returned to the
       message, whose size is updated accordingly.


7.  Provisioning of Routers

   Before a router using this framework is able to generate ICVs or
   validate messages, it MUST acquire the shared secret key(s) to be
   used by all routers that are to participate in the network.  This
   specification does not define how a router acquires secret keys.
   Once a router has acquired suitable key(s) it MAY be configured to
   use, or not use, this framework.  Section 23.6 of [OLSRv2] provides a
   rationale based on [BCP107] why no key management is specified for
   OLSRv2.


8.  IANA Considerations

9.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a security framework for use with NHDP and
   OLSRv2 that allows for alleviating several security threats.

9.1.  Alleviated Attacks

   This section briefly summarizes security threats that are alleviated
   by the framework presented in this document.

9.1.1.  Identity Spoofing

   As only routers possessing the selected shared secret key are able to
   add a valid ICV TLV to a message, identity spoofing, where an
   attacker falsely claims an identity of a valid router, is countered.

9.1.2.  Link Spoofing

   Link spoofing, where an attacker falsely represents the existence of
   a non-existent link, or otherwise misrepresents a link's state, is
   countered by the framework specified in this document, using the same
   argument as in Section 9.1.1.

9.1.3.  Replay Attack

   Replay attacks are partly countered by the framework specified in
   this document, but this depends on synchronized clocks of all routers
   in the MANET.  An attacker that records messages to replay them later
   can only do so in the selected time interval after the timestamp that
   is contained in message.  As an attacker cannot modify the content of
   this timestamp (as it is protected by the identity check value), an
   attacker cannot replay messages after this time.  Within this time
   interval it is still possible to perform replay attacks, however the
   limits on the time interval are specified so that this will have a
   limited effect on the operation of the protocol.

9.2.  Limitations

   If no synchronized clocks are available in the MANET, replay attacks
   cannot be countered by the framework provided by this document.  An
   alternative version of the TIMESTAMP TLV defined in [RFC6622bis],
   with a monotonic sequence number, may have some partial value in this
   case, but will necessitate adding state to record observed message
   sequence number information.

   The framework provided by this document does not avoid or detect
   security attacks by routers possessing the shared secret key that is
   used to generate integrity check values for messages.

   This framework relies on an out-of-band protocol or mechanism for
   distributing the shared secret key(s) (and if an alternative
   integrity check value is used, any additional cryptographic
   parameters).

   This framework does not provide a key revocation mechanism.
