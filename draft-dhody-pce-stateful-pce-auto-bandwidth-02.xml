      <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The extensions described in <xref target="STATEFUL-PCE"/> provide stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP) via PCEP, for a model where the PCC delegates control over one or more locally configured LSPs to the PCE.</t>
      <t>This document describes the automatic bandwidth adjustment of such LSPs under the stateful PCE model.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
    	<t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) as the communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between PCE and PCE, enabling computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP).</t>
    	<t><xref target="STATEFUL-PCE"/> specifies extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of MPLS TE LSPs. In this document focus is on Active Stateful PCE where LSPs are configured on the PCC and control over them is delegated to the PCE.</t>
    	<t>Over time, based on the varying traffic pattern, an LSP established with certain bandwidth may require to adjust the reserved bandwidth over time automatically. Ingress Label Switch Router (LSR) samples the traffic rate at each sample-interval to determine the traffic information as Maximum Average Bandwidth (MaxAvgBw). Further adjustment to the reserved bandwidth should be made at every adjustment-interval automatically.</t>
    	<t>Enabling Auto-Bandwidth on a LSP results in the LSP automatically adjusting its bandwidth based on the actual traffic flowing through the LSP. A LSP can therefore be setup with some arbitrary (or zero) bandwidth value such that the LSP automatically monitors the traffic flow and adjusts its bandwidth every adjustment-interval period. The bandwidth adjustment uses the make-before-break signaling method so that there is no interruption to traffic flow. This is described in detail in <xref target="sec_auto"/>.</t>
    	<t><xref target="STATEFUL-PCE-APP"/> describes the usecase for auto-bandwidth adjustment for passive and active stateful PCE. Active stateful PCE can use information such as historical trending data, application-specific information about expected demands or policy information, as well as knowledge of the actual desired flow volumes to make smarter bandwidth adjustment to delegated LSPs.</t>
    	<t>This document defines extensions needed to support Auto-Bandwidth feature along with mechanism to provide traffic information of the LSPs in a stateful PCE model using PCEP. At the same time this document does not exclude use of any other mechanism employed by stateful PCE to learn real time traffic information etc.</t>

    <section title="Architectural Overview" toc="default">
      <section title="Auto-Bandwidth Overview" toc="default" anchor="sec_auto">
        <t>Auto-Bandwidth feature allows an LSP to automatically and dynamically adjust its reserved bandwidth over time, i.e. without network operator intervention. The bandwidth adjustment uses the make-before-break adaptive signaling method so that there is no interruption to traffic flow.</t>
        <t>The new bandwidth reservation is determined by sampling the actual traffic flowing through the LSP. If the traffic flowing through the LSP is lower than the configured or current bandwidth of the LSP, the extra bandwidth is being reserved needlessly and being wasted. Conversely, if the actual traffic flowing through the LSP is higher than the configured or current bandwidth of the LSP, it can potentially cause congestion or packet loss. With Auto-Bandwidth feature, the LSP bandwidth can be set to some arbitrary value (even zero) during initial setup time, and it will be periodically adjusted over time based on the actual bandwidth requirement.</t>
        <t>Note the following terms:</t>
        <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Maximum Average Bandwidth (MaxAvgBw):">The maximum average bandwidth is the unit to measure the current traffic demand between a time interval. This is the maximum value of the averaged traffic pattern in a particular time interval.</t>
          <t hangText="Sample-Interval:">The time interval in which the traffic rate (MaxAvgBw) is collected as a sample.</t> 
          <t hangText="Adjustment-Interval:">The time interval in which the bandwidth adjustment should be made based on the MaxAvgBw.</t>
          <t hangText="Minimum Bandwidth:">The minimum bandwidth that should be reserved for the LSP.</t>
          <t hangText="Maximum Bandwidth:">The maximum bandwidth that can be reserved for the LSP.</t>
          <t hangText="Report-Threshold:">This value indicates when the MaxAvgBw must be reported to stateful PCE via PCRpt message. Only if the percentage difference between the current MaxAvgBw and the last MaxAvgBw is greater than or equal to the threshold percentage the LSP bandwidth is reported to PCE.</t>
          <t hangText="Adjust-Threshold:">This value indicates when the bandwidth must be adjusted. Only if the percentage difference between the current MaxAvgBw  and the current bandwidth allocation is greater than or equal to the threshold percentage the LSP bandwidth is adjusted to the current bandwidth demand.</t>
        </list>
	</t>   
      </section>
      <section title="Deploying Auto-Bandwidth Feature" toc="default">
      	<t>The traffic rate is repeatedly sampled at each sample-interval (which can be configured by the user and the default value as 5 minutes). The sampled traffic rates are accumulated over the adjustment-interval period(which can be configured by the user and the default value as 24 hours).</t> 
      	<t>The ingress LSR reports the traffic information to the stateful PCE via the PCRpt message, to avoid multiple reports, the Report-Threshold percentage is used. Only if the percentage difference between the current MaxAvgBw and the last MaxAvgBw is greater than or equal to the threshold percentage the LSP bandwidth is reported to PCE.</t> 
      	<t>Stateful PCE will adjust the bandwidth of the LSP to the highest sampled traffic rate amongst the set of samples taken over the adjustment-interval. Note that the highest sampled traffic rate could be higher or lower than the current LSP bandwidth. Only if the current MaxAvgBw  and the current bandwidth allocation is greater than or equal to the Adjust-Threshold percentage the LSP bandwidth is adjusted to the current bandwidth demand.</t>
      	<t>Also to avoid multiple LSP re-signaling, sometimes operator set up longer adjustment intervals. However long adjustment-interval can also result in an undesirable effect of masking sudden changes in traffic patterns. To avoid this, the stateful PCE MAY pre-maturely expire the adjustment-interval to accommodate sudden bursts in traffic.</t>
