                  IP TUNNEL MIB Extention for softwire
                draft-shishio-softwire-rfc4087update-00

Abstract

   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use
   with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
   particular,it describes managed objects used for managing tunnels of
   any type over IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

   IP TUNNEL MIB[RFC4087] provides provisioning capability for IPv4 and
   IPv6 tunnel by SNMP.  But it is not eqnough to support modern tunnel
   protocol such as 6rd[RFC5969] and MAP[draft-ietf-softwire-map].  The
   document describes extention of IP TUNNEL MIB[RFC4087] to support
   6rd[RFC5969] and MAP[draft-ietf-softwire-map].

1.  Introduction

   IP TUNNEL MIB[RFC4087] are used for managing tunnels of any type over
   IPv4 and IPv6 networks, including Generic Routing Encapslation
   (GRE)[RFC1701,RFC1702],IP-in-IP[RFC2003], Minimal Encapsulation
   [RFC2004], Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) [RFC2661], Point-to-
   Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) [RFC2637], Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F)
   [RFC2341], UDP (e.g., [RFC1234]), Ascend Tunnel Management Protocol
   (ATMP) [RFC2107], and IPv6-in-IPv4 [RFC2893] tunnels, among others.
   Over the past several years, there has been a number of "tunneling"
   protocols specified by the IETF (see [RFC1241] for an early
   discussion of the model and examples).  This document describes a
   Management Information Base (MIB) module used for managing tunnels of
   any type over IPv4 and IPv6 networks, including Generic Routing
   Encapsulation (GRE) [RFC1701,RFC1702], IP-in-IP [RFC2003], Minimal
   Encapsulation [RFC2004], Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) [RFC2661],
   Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) [RFC2637], Layer 2
   Forwarding (L2F) [RFC2341], UDP (e.g., [RFC1234]), Ascend Tunnel
   Management Protocol (ATMP) [RFC2107], and IPv6-in-IPv4 [RFC2893]
   tunnels, among others.

   This documents describes how to support IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd)
   [RFC5969] and Mapping of Address and Port
   (MAP)[draft-ietf-softwire-map] in IP TUNNEL MIB.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft           IP TUNNEL MIB Extention               July 2012


4.  Overview

   IP TUNNEL MIB [RFC4087] are using provisioning for tunnel protocol,
   but could not support 6rd [RFC5969] and MAP [draft-ietf-softwire-map]
   due to lack of parameters.  But MAP [draft-ietf-softwire-map] has
   compativility with DS-Lite [RFC6333] and stateless NAT64 [RFC6145].
   Therefore if TUNNEL MIB once supports 6rd [RFC5969] and
   MAP[draft-ietf-softwire-map],it could manage many type of modern
   tunnels such as 6rd [RFC5969], MAP-T/MAP-E, DS-Lite [RFC6333], and
   XLAT464 CLAT [draft-ietf-v6ops-464xlat].


5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The MIB module specified herein provides one way to manage the 6rd
   and MAP devices thorough SNMP.

5.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The SAMPLE-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

5.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   The Interface MIB [RFC2863] requires that any MIB module which is an
   adjunct of the Interface MIB clarify specific areas within the
   Interface MIB.  These areas were intentionally left vague in the
   Interface MIB to avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding
   management of certain media-types.

   Section 4 of [RFC2863] enumerates several areas which a media-
   specific MIB must clarify.  The implementor is referred to [RFC2863]
   in order to understand the general intent of these areas.

5.3.  Relationship to the IP TUNNEL MIB

   The IP Tunnel MIB [RFC4087] contains objects common to all IP
   tunnels, including 6rd/MAP Additionally, tunnel encapsulation
   specific MIB (like what is defined in this document) extend the IP
   tunnel MIB to further describe encapsulation specific information.

   for example:

   6rd case

Internet-Draft           IP TUNNEL MIB Extention               July 2012


   6rd prefix, 6rd Prefix Length, IPv4Mask Length

   MAP case

   rule IPv6 prefix, rule IPv6 prefix Length, rule IPv4 prefix , rule
   IPv4 prefix length, EA-bit length, PSID

   tunnel method, BR address, source addresss could use tunnelIfEntry.

      TunnelIfEntry ::= SEQUENCE {
          tunnelIfLocalAddress            IpAddress,   -- deprecated
          tunnelIfRemoteAddress           IpAddress,   -- deprecated
          tunnelIfEncapsMethod            IANAtunnelType,
          tunnelIfHopLimit                Integer32,
          tunnelIfSecurity                INTEGER,
          tunnelIfTOS                     Integer32,
          tunnelIfFlowLabel               IPv6FlowLabelOrAny,
          tunnelIfAddressType             InetAddressType,
          tunnelIfLocalInetAddress        InetAddress,
          tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress       InetAddress,
          tunnelIfEncapsLimit             Integer32
      }

   tunnelIfEncapsMethod must be sixRd(xx), MAPT(xx) and MAPE(xx).

   tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress must be BR address for CE.  When 6rd, it
   would be IPv4 address.  When MAP-T and MAP-E, it would be IPv6
   address. 0.0.0.0 :: would be used for BR.  TunnelIfXEntry would use
   for another prametors .

5.4.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], and IF-MIB [RFC2863]

7.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
      Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
      even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
      allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
      objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator

   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


8.  IANA Considerations

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

              Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
             ----------        -----------------------

            TunnelIXEntry       { tunnel  XXX }


             IANAtunnelType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
                 SYNTAX     INTEGER {

                            sixRd ("XX")        -- 6rd encapsulation
                            MAPT  ("XX")        -- MAP-T encapsulation
                            MAPE  ("XX")        -- MAP-T encapsulation
                            }
