This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
(MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based
internets.  In particular, it defines objects for managing the
Ethernet Wide Area Network (WAN) Interface Sublayer (WIS).

The MIB module defined in this memo is an extension of the Synchronous
Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) Interface
MIB and is implemented in conjunction with it and with the
Ethernet-like Interface MIB, the 802.3 Medium Attachment Unit MIB, the
Interfaces Group MIB, and the Inverted Stack Table MIB.

This document is a product of the Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB
Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
