Abstract

   RFC 2872 defines an Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) object for 
   application identifiers.  This document uses that App-ID and gives 
   implementers specific guidelines for differing voice and video 
   stream identifications to nodes along a reservation path, creating 
   specific profiles for voice and video session identification.

1.  Introduction  

   RFC 2872 [RFC2872] describes the usage of policy elements for 
   providing application information in Resource Reservation Protocol 
   (RSVP) signaling [RFC2205]. The intention of providing this 
   information is to enable application-based policy control. However, 
   RFC 2872 does not enumerate any application profiles. The absence 
   of explicit, uniform profiles leads to incompatible handling of 
   these values and misapplied policies. An application profile used by
   a sender might not be understood by the intermediaries or receiver 
   in a different domain. Therefore, there is a need to enumerate 
   application profiles that are universally understood and applied for
   correct policy control. 

   Call control between endpoints has the ability to bind or associate 
   many attributes to a reservation. One new attribute is currently 
   being defined so as to establish the type of traffic contained in 
   that reservation. This is accomplished via assigning a traffic label
   to the call (or session or flow) [ID-TRAF-CLASS].

Internet-Draft            RSVP APP-ID Profiles                 Feb 2013

   This document takes the application traffic classes from 
   [ID-TRAF-CLASS] and places those strings in the APP-ID object 
   defined in RFC 2872.  Thus, the intermediary devices (e.g., routers)
   processing the RSVP message can learn the identified profile within 
   the Application-ID policy element for a particular reservation, and 
   possibly be configured with the profile(s) to understand them 
   correctly, thus performing the correct admission control.

   Another goal of this document is to the ability to signal an 
   application profile which can then be translated into a DSCP value 
   as per the choice of each domain. While the DCLASS object [RFC2996] 
   allows the transfer of DSCP value in an RSVP message, that RFC does 
   not allow the flexibility of having different domains choosing the 
   DSCP value for the traffic classes that they maintain.  

   How these labels indicate the appropriate Differentiated Services 
   Codepoint (DSCP) is out of scope for this document. 

   This document will break out each application type and propose how 
   the values in application-id template should be populated for 
   uniformity and interoperability.



2.  Application ID Template

   The template from RFC 2872 is as follows:

                0              1               2               3
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    PE Length (8)              |   P-type = AUTH_APP           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    Attribute Length           |   A-type =    |  Sub-type =   |
   |                               | POLICY_LOCATOR|   ASCII_DN    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                 Application name as ASCII string              |
   |                         (e.g. SAP.EXE)                        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   In line with how this policy element is constructed in RFC 2872, the
   A-type will remain "POLICY_LOCATOR". 

   The P-type field is first created in [RFC2752]. This document 
   uses the existing P-type "AUTH_APP" for application traffic class. 

   The first Sub-type will be mandatory for every profile within this 
   document, and will be "ASCII_DN".  No other Sub-types are defined by
   any profile within this document, but MAY be included by individual 
   implementations - and MUST be ignored if not understood by receiving
   implementations along the reservation path.

Internet-Draft            RSVP APP-ID Profiles                Sept 2013

   RFC 2872 states the #1 sub-element from RFC 2872 as the "identifier 
   that uniquely identifies the application vendor", which is optional 
   to include.  This document modifies this vendor limitation so that 
   the identifier need only be unique - and not limited to an 
   application vendor (identifier). For example, this specification now
   allows an RFC that defines an industry recognizable term or string 
   to be a valid identifier. For example, a term or string taken from 
   another IETF document, such as "conversational" or "avconf" from 
   [ID-TRAF-CLASS]. This sub-element is still optional to include.

   The following subsections will define the values within the above 
   template into specific profiles for voice and video identification.


3.  The Voice and Video Application-ID Profiles

   This section contains the elements of the Application ID policy 
   object which is used to signal the application classes defined in 
   [ID-TRAF-CLASS]. 

3.1 The Broadcast Profiles

   Broadcast profiles are for minimally buffered one-way streaming 
   flows, such as video surveillance, or Internet based concerts or 
   non-VOD TV broadcasts such as live sporting events.

   This document creates Broadcast profiles for 

   - Broadcast IPTV for audio and video
   - Broadcast Live-events for audio and video
   - Broadcast Surveillance for audio and video

   Here is an example profile for identifying Broadcast 
   Video-Surveillance

      AUTH_APP, POLICY_LOCATOR, ASCII_DN, 
     "GUID=http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfcXXXX.txt,
      APP=broadcast.video.surveillance, VER="

   [Editor's Note: "rfcXXXX" will be replaced with the RFC number 
                    assigned to the [ID-TRAF-CLASS] reference. This 
                    'note' should be removed during the RFC-Editor 
                    review process.]

   Where the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) indicates the documented 
   reference that created this well-known string [ID-TRAF-CLASS], the 
   APP is the profile name with no spaces, and the "VER=" is included, 
   but has no value at this time.

3.2 The Realtime Interactive Profiles

   Realtime Interactive profiles are for on-line gaming, and both 
   remote and virtual avconf applications, in which the timing is 
   particularly important towards the feedback to uses of these 
   applications. This traffic type will generally not be UDP based, 
   with minimal tolerance to RTT delays.

   This document creates Realtime Interactive profiles for 

   - Realtime-Interactive Gaming
   - Realtime-Interactive Remote-Desktop
   - Realtime-Interactive Virtualized-Desktop

   Here is the profile for identifying Realtime-Interactive Gaming 

      AUTH_APP, POLICY_LOCATOR, ASCII_DN, 
     "GUID=http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfcXXXX.txt,
      APP=realtime-interactive.gaming, VER="

   Where the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) indicates the documented 
   reference that created this well-known string [ID-TRAF-CLASS], the 
   APP is the profile name with no spaces, and the "VER=" is included, 
   but has no value, but MAY if versioning becomes important.


3.3 The Multimedia Conferencing Profiles

   There will be Multimedia Conferencing profiles for presentation 
   data, application sharing and whiteboarding, where these 
   applications will most often be associated with a larger 
   Conversational (audio and/or audio/video) conference. Timing is 
   important, but some minimal delays are acceptable, unlike the case 
   for Realtime-Interactive traffic.

  This document creates Multimedia-Conferencing profiles for

   - Multimedia-Conferencing presentation-data
   - Multimedia-Conferencing presentation-video
   - Multimedia-Conferencing presentation-audio
   - Multimedia-Conferencing application-sharing
   - Multimedia-Conferencing whiteboarding

   Here is the profile for identifying Multimedia-Conferencing 
   Application-sharing

      AUTH_APP, POLICY_LOCATOR, ASCII_DN, 
     "GUID=http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfcXXXX.txt,
      APP=multimedia-conferencing.application-sharing, VER="

   Where the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) indicates the RFC 
   reference that created this well-known string [ID-TRAF-CLASS], the

   APP is the profile name with no spaces, and the "VER=" is included, 
   but has no value, but MAY if versioning becomes important.

3.4 The Multimedia Streaming Profiles

   Multimedia Streaming profiles are for more significantly buffered 
   one-way streaming flows than Broadcast profiles. These include...

   This document creates Multimedia Streaming profiles for 

   - Multimedia-Streaming multiplex
   - Multimedia-Streaming webcast

   Here is the profile for identifying Multimedia Streaming 
   webcast

      AUTH_APP, POLICY_LOCATOR, ASCII_DN, 
     "GUID=http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfcXXXX.txt,
      APP=multimedia-streaming.webcast, VER="

   Where the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) indicates the documented 
   reference that created this well-known string [ID-TRAF-CLASS], the 
   APP is the profile name with no spaces, and the "VER=" is included, 
   but has no value, but MAY if versioning becomes important.


3.5 The Conversational Profiles

   Conversational category is for realtime bidirectional 
   communications, such as voice or video, and is the most numerous due
   to the choices of application with or without adjectives. The number
   of profiles is then doubled because there needs to be one for 
   unadmitted and one for admitted.  The IANA section lists all that 
   are currently proposed for registration at this time, therefore 
   there will not be an exhaustive list provided in this section.

   This document creates Conversational profiles for 

   - Conversational Audio 
   - Conversational Audio Admitted
   - Conversational Video 
   - Conversational Video Admitted
   - Conversational Audio Avconf
   - Conversational Audio Avconf Admitted
   - Conversational Video Avconf
   - Conversational Video Avconf Admitted
   - Conversational Audio Immersive
   - Conversational Audio Immersive Admitted
   - Conversational Video Immersive
   - Conversational Video Immersive Admitted

   Here is an example profile for identifying Conversational Audio:

     AUTH_APP, POLICY_LOCATOR, ASCII_DN, 
     "GUID=http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfcXXXX.txt,
     APP=conversational.audio, VER="

   Where the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) indicates the documented 
   reference that created this well-known string [ID-TRAF-CLASS], the 
   APP is the profile name with no spaces, and the "VER=" is included, 
   but has no value, but MAY if versioning becomes important.


4.  Security considerations

   The security considerations section within RFC 2872 sufficiently 
   covers this document, with one possible exception - someone using 
   the wrong template values (e.g., claiming a reservation is 
   Multimedia Streaming when it is in fact Real-time Interactive).  
   Given that each traffic flow is within separate reservations, and 
   RSVP does not have the ability to police the type of traffic within 
   any reservation, solving for this appears to be administratively 
   handled at best. This is not meant to be a 'punt', but there really 
   is nothing this template creates that is going to make things any 
   harder for anyone (that we know of now).


5.  IANA considerations

5.1 Application Profiles

   This document requests IANA create a new registry for the 
   application identification classes similar to the following table 
   within the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters registry:

   Registry Name: RSVP APP-ID Profiles
   Reference: [this document]
   Registration procedures: Standards Track document [RFC5226]

   [Editor's Note: "rfcXXXX" will be replaced with the RFC number 
                    assigned to the [ID-TRAF-CLASS] reference. This 
                    'note' should be removed during the RFC-Editor 
                    review process.]

Appendix - Changes to ID

   [Editor's Note: this appendix should be removed in the RFC-Editor's 
                   process.]

A.1 - Changes from WG version -00 to WG version -01

   The following changes were made in this version:

   - corrected nits

   - globally replaced GUID link from the MMUSIC Trafficclass ID to the
     future RFC of that document.

   - added profiles for presentation-video and presentation-audio


A.2 - Changes from Individual -04 to WG version -00

   The following changes were made in this version:



Polk & Dhesikan          Expires March 19, 2014               [Page 14]
Internet-Draft            RSVP APP-ID Profiles                Sept 2013

   - changed P-Type from APP_TC back to AUTH_APP, which is already 
     defined.

   - fixed nits and inconsistencies


A.3 - Changes from Individual -03 to -04

   The following changes were made in this version:

   - clarified security considerations section to mean RSVP cannot 
     police the type of traffic within a reservation to know if a 
     traffic flow should be using a different profile, as defined in 
     this document.

   - changed existing informative language regarding "... other 
     Sub-types ..." from 'can' to normative 'MAY'. 
   - editorial changes to clear up minor mistakes


A.4 - Changes from Individual -02 to -03

   The following changes were made in this version:

   - Added [ID-TRAF-CLASS] as a reference

   - Changed to a new format of the profile string.

   - Added many new profiles based on the new format into each parent 
     category of Section 3.

   - changed the GUID to refer to draft-ietf-mmusic-traffic-class-for-
     sdp-03.txt

   - changed 'desktop' adjective to 'avconf' to keep in alignment with 
     [ID-TRAF-CLASS]

   - Have a complete IANA Registry proposal for each application-ID 
     discussed in this draft.

   - General text clean-up of the draft.
