Internet-Draft         SenderID and SPF conclusion         February 2012


1.  Introduction

   In April 2006, RFC 4405 [RFC4405], SMTP Service Extension for
   Indicating the Responsible Submitter of an E-Mail Message, RFC 4406
   [RFC4406], Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail, RFC 4407 [RFC4407],
   Purported Responsible Address in E-Mail Messages and RFC 4408
   [RFC4408], Sender Policy Framework (SPF) were published
   simultaneously as Experimental RFCs.  There was no general technical
   consensus about how to reconcile the two approaches known as Sender
   ID [RFC4406] and SPF [RFC4408].

   This memo concludes the Sender ID and SPF experiments by obsoleting
   the following RFCs: the SMTP Service Extension for Indicating the
   Responsible Submitter of an E-Mail Message [RFC4405], the SMTP
   Service Extension for Indicating the Responsible Submitter of an
   E-Mail Message [RFC4406], and Purported Responsible Address in E-Mail
   Messages [RFC4407].

1.1.  Strawman proposal

   This memo offers a "strawman" proposal to conclude the SenderID and
   SPF experiments.


2.  Issues identified by the IESG

   The following issues were identified in IESG Note attached to the
   Experimental RFCs:

   o  The Sender ID experiment may use DNS records that may have been
      created for the current SPF experiment or earlier versions in this
      set of experiments.  Depending on the content of the record, this
      may mean that Sender-ID heuristics would be applied incorrectly to
      a message.  Depending on the actions associated by the recipient
      with those heuristics, the message may not be delivered or may be
      discarded on receipt.

   o  Participants in the Sender-ID experiment need to be aware that the
      way Resent-* header fields are used will result in failure to
      receive legitimate email when interacting with standards-compliant
      systems (specifically automatic forwarders which comply with the
      standards by not adding Resent-* headers, and systems which comply
      with RFC 822 but have not yet implemented RFC 2822 Resent-*
      semantics).

   In addition, the IESG advised participants publishing SPF experiment
   DNS records to follow section 3.4 of RFC 4406 and publish both v=spf1
   and spf2.0 records to avoid the conflict.

3.  Discussion

3.1.  DNS Records for SenderID and SPF

   The Alexa top one million web hosts were used as a sample of domains.
   287000 of the domains in the sample published SPF records.

                          Table 1: SPF qualifiers

   4613 of the domains published SPF (Type 99) DNS records.
   Approximately 800 of these DNS records do not match the "TXT"
   version. 578 domains in the sample published "v=spf2" records.

3.2.  Resent header fields

   According to RFC 5322 [RFC5322] (Section 3.6.6), Resent fields are
   used to identify a message as having been reintroduced into the
   transport system by a user.  The purpose of using Resent fields is to
   have the message appear to the final recipient as if it were sent
   directly by the original sender, with all of the original fields
   remaining the same.  RFC 5322 notes that reintroducing a message into
   the transport system and using Resent fields is a different operation

   from "forwarding"

   There is currently no data to determine whether Resent-* headers
   fields are being added for participants in the SenderID experiment.

3.3.  Implementation of SUBMITTER SMTP service extension

   There has not been widespread implementation of the SUBMITTER SMTP
   service extension.


4.  Outstanding issues

   The SPFBIS Working Group was chartered in February 2012 to work on an
   update of RFC 4408 [RFC4408].  The following outstanding issues
   should be addressed:

   o  Should DNS RR of type SPF, code 99 be used in an update of RFC
      4408?

   o  Mail forwarding


5.  Conclusion

   The IESG invited the community to observe the success or failure of
   the SenderID and SPF approaches after the publication of the
   Experimental RFCs.  It is not possible to determine which approach
   was a success or failure as the requirements to assess that were not
   defined.  It is recommended that the experiments be concluded by
   obsoleting the SenderID Experimental RFCs.  It is the consensus of
   the IETF to produce a standards track document, based on RFC 4408
   [RFC4408], which defines a Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for
   Authorizing Use of Domains in E-Mail.

   Given that the SUBMITTER SMTP service extension is not widely
   implemented and deployed, its use is deprecated.


6.  Security Considerations

   Concluding the SenderID and SPF experiments will not cause loss of
   mail.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The following note for the SUBMITTER SMTP extension should be added

   in the "SMTP Service Extensions" registry:

      The use of SUBMITTER is deprecated by RFC XXXX.


8.  Acknowledgements

   I would like to thank Philip Gladstone for his research on the usage
   of DNS Records for SenderID and SPF and for providing the data in
   Section 3.1.
