This document defines a protocol for the backhauling of Signaling
System 7 Message Transfer Part 2 (SS7 MTP2) User signalling messages
over IP using the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  This
protocol would be used between a Signalling Gateway (SG) and Media
Gateway Controller (MGC).  It is assumed that the SG receives SS7
signalling over a standard SS7 interface using the SS7 Message
Transfer Part (MTP) to provide transport.  The Signalling Gateway
would act as a Signalling Link Terminal.

This document is a product of the Signaling Transport Working Group of
the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
