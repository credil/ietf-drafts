    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Various solutions (e.g., <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-mesh-multicast"></xref>, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast"></xref>) have been proposed
      to allow access to IPv4 multicast content from hosts attached to
      IPv6-enabled domains. Even if these solutions have distinct
      applicability scopes (translation vs. encapsulation) and target
      different use cases, they all make use of specific IPv6 multicast
      addresses to embed an IPv4 multicast address. Particularly, the
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address is used as a destination IPv6
      address of multicast flows received from an IPv4-enabled domain and
      injected by the IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function into an IPv6-enabled
      domain. It is also used to build an IPv6 multicast state (*, G6) or (S6,
      G6) corresponding to their (*, G4) or (S4, G4) IPv4 counter parts by the
      IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function. <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps"></xref> provides more discussion
      about issues related to IPv4/IPv6 multicast.</t>

      <t>This document reserves two prefixes to be used to synthesize
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address. This document also defines how
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast addresses are constructed. Both IPv4-IPv6
      translation or encapsulation schemes can make use of these prefixes.</t>

      <t><xref target="justification"></xref> enumerates the arguments in
      favor of reserving dedicated prefixes <xref target="wkp"></xref>
      discusses why identifying an IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address is
      needed.</t>

      <t>This specification can be used in conjunction with other extensions
      such as building unicast prefix-based multicast IPv6 address <xref
      target="RFC3306"></xref> or embedding the rendezvous point <xref
      target="RFC3956"></xref>. These techniques are important tools to
      simplify IPv6 multicast deployments. Indeed, unicast prefix-based IPv6
      addressing is used in many current IPv6 multicast deployments, and has
      also been defined for IPv4, and is seen as a very useful technique. Also
      embedded-RP is used in existing deployments. </t>

      <t>This document is a companion document to <xref
      target="RFC6052"></xref> which focuses exclusively on IPv4-embedded IPv6
      unicast addresses.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This document makes use of the following terms:<?rfc subcompact="no" ?><list
          style="symbols">
          <t>IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address: denotes a multicast IPv6
          address which includes in 32 bits an IPv4 address.</t>

          <t>Multicast Prefix64 (or MPREFIX64 for short) refers to an IPv6
          multicast prefix to be used to construct IPv4-embedded IPv6
          multicast addresses. This prefix is used to build an IPv4-embedded
          IPv6 multicast address as defined in <xref target="algo"></xref>.
          <xref target="algo"></xref> specifies also how to extract an IPv4
          address from an IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address.</t>

          <t>ASM_MPREFIX64: denotes a multicast Prefix64 used in Any Source
          Multicast (ASM) mode.</t>

          <t>SSM_MPREFIX64: denotes a multicast Prefix64 used in Source
          Specific Multicast (SSM) mode.</t>

          <t>IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function: refers to a function which is
          enabled in a node interconnecting an IPv4-enabled domain with an
          IPv6-enabled one. It can be located in various places of the
          multicast network. Particularly, in terms of multicast control
          messages, it can be an IGMP/MLD Interworking Function or an
          IPv4-IPv6 PIM Interworking Function. An IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection
          Function is configured with one or two MPREFIX64s.</t>

      <section title="Reserving Dedicated Prefixes">
        <t>The following constraints should be met when reserving dedicated
        prefix(es) to be used for IPv4/IPv6 multicast interconnection:</t>

        <t><list style="format %d:">
            <t>Belong to ff3x::/32 and be compatible with unicast-based prefix
            <xref target="RFC3306"></xref> for SSM. Note that <xref
            target="RFC3306"></xref> suggests to set "plen" to 0 and
            "network-prefix" to 0. As such, any prefix in the 33-96 range can
            be convenient. Given <xref target="RFC4607"></xref> indicates
            future specifications may allow a non-zero network prefix field, a
            /33 would allow for future extensions but it has the drawback of
            reserving a large block. A /96 would be adequate for the use cases
            already identified in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps"></xref>. In the event of
            any concrete extension, reserving additional prefixes may be
            considered.</t>

            <t>Be compatible with embedded-RP <xref target="RFC3956"></xref>
            and unicast-based prefix <xref target="RFC3306"></xref> for ASM.
            This results in a prefix length to be in the 17-20 range. A /17
            has the advantage of allowing for future extensions but it may be
            seen as a waste of the multicast address space. Consequently, a
            /20 is preferred.</t>

            <t>Avoid ff3x::4000:0001-ff3x::7fff:ffff which is reserved for
            IANA.</t>
          </list>Meeting (1) and (2) with the same prefix is not feasible
        without modifying embedded-RP and unicast-based prefix specifications;
        this option is avoided.</t>

        <t>As a consequence, two multicast prefixes are proposed to be used
        when embedding IPv4 address: one prefix for ASM and another one for
        the SSM. This document reserves the following multicast prefixes to be
        used in the context of IPv4/IPv6 multicast interconnection:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>ff3x:0:8000::/96 SSM range to embed an IPv4 multicast address
            in the last 32 bits.</t>

            <t>ffxx:8000::/20 ASM range to embed an IPv4 multicast address in
            the last 32 bits.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="mprefix" title="IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Multicast Address">
        <t><!---->For the delivery of the IPv4-IPv6 multicast interconnection
        services, a dedicated multicast prefix denoted as MPREFIX64 should be
        provisioned (e.g., using NETCONF or <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-softwire-multicast-prefix-option"></xref>) to any
        function requiring to build an IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address
        based on an IPv4 multicast address. MPREFIX64 can be of ASM or SSM
        type. When both modes are used, two prefixes are required to be
        provisioned.</t>

        <t>The length of MPREFIX64 MUST be /96. MPREFIX64 should belong to
        ffxx:8000::/20 for ASM mode and ff3x:0:8000::/96 for the SSM mode.</t>

        <t>For the ASM mode, the format of the MPREFIX64 should follow what is
        specified in <xref target="RFC3306"></xref> and <xref
        target="RFC3956"></xref> if corresponding mechanisms are used. If not,
        bits 21-96 can be set to any value.</t>

        <t><xref target="address_format"></xref> shows how to build an
        IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address using a configured MPREFIX64 and
        an IPv4 multicast address. The low-order 32 bits MUST include an IPv4
        multicast address. The enclosed IPv4 multicast address SHOULD NOT be
        in 232/8 range if an ASM_PREFIX64 is configured. The enclosed IPv4
        multicast address SHOULD be in 232/8 range if an SSM_PREFIX64 is
        configured.</t>

        <t>Embedding an IPv4 multicast address in the last 32 bits does not
        conflict with the Group IDs assigned by IANA (i.e., 0x00000001 to
        0x3FFFFFFF <xref target="RFC3307"></xref>).</t>

        <t>When several MPREFIX64 are available, it is RECOMMENDED to use the
        MPREFIX64 which preserve the scope of the IPv4 multicast address.</t>

        <t>Arguments why an IPv6 address format is needed to embed multicast
        IPv4 address are quite similar to those of <xref
        target="RFC6052"></xref>. Concretely, the definition of a multicast
        address format embedding a multicast IPv4 address allows:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Stateless IPv4-IPv6 header translation of multicast flows;</t>

            <t>Stateless IPv4-IPv6 PIM interworking function;</t>

            <t>Stateless IGMP-MLD interworking function (e.g., required for an
            IPv4 receiver to access to IPv4 multicast content via an IPv6
            network);</t>

            <t>Stateless (local) synthesis of IPv6 address when IPv4 multicast
            address are embedded in application payload (e.g., SDP <xref
            target="RFC4566"></xref>);</t>

            <t>Except the provisioning of the same MPREFIX64, no coordination
            is required between IPv4-IPv6 PIM interworking function, IGMP-MLD
            interworking function, IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function and any
            ALG (Application Level Gateway) in the path;</t>

            <t>Minimal operational constraints on the multicast address
            management: IPv6 multicast addresses can be constructed using what
            has been deployed for IPv4 delivery mode.</t>

               title="Why Identifying an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Multicast Address is Required?">
        <t>Reserving a dedicated multicast prefix for IPv4-IPv6
        interconnection purposes is a means to guide the address selection
        process at the receiver side; in particular it assists the receiver to
        select the appropriate IP multicast address while avoiding to involve
        an IPv4-IPv6 interconnection function in the path.</t>

        <t>Two use cases to illustrate this behavior are provided below:<list
            style="numbers">
            <t>An ALG is required to help an IPv6 receiver to select the
            appropriate IP address when only the IPv4 address is advertised
            (e.g., using SDP); otherwise the access to the IPv4 multicast
            content can not be offered to the IPv6 receiver. The ALG may be
            located downstream the receiver. As such, the ALG does not know in
            advance whether the receiver is dual-stack or IPv6-only. The ALG
            may be tuned to insert both the original IPv4 address and
            corresponding IPv6 multicast address. If a dedicated prefix is not
            used, a dual-stack receiver may prefer to use the IPv6 address to
            receive the multicast content. This address selection would
            require multicast flows to cross an IPv4-IPv6 interconnection
            function.</t>

            <t>In order to avoid involving an ALG in the path, an IPv4-only
            source can advertise both its IPv4 address and IPv4-embedded IPv6
            multicast address. If a dedicated prefix is not reserved, a
            dual-stack receiver may prefer to use the IPv6 address to receive
            the multicast content. This address selection would require
            multicast flows to cross an IPv4-IPv6 interconnection
            function.</t>
          </list>Reserving dedicated IPv6 multicast prefixes for IPv4-IPv6
        interconnection purposes mitigates the issues discussed in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-behave-nat64-learn-analysis"></xref> in a multicast
        context.</t>

      <section title="Location of the IPv4 Address">
        <t>There is no strong argument to allow for flexible options to encode
        the IPv4 address inside the multicast IPv6 address. The option
        retained by the authors is to encode the multicast IPv4 address in the
        low-order 32 bits of the IPv6 address.</t>

        <t>This choice is also motivated by the need to be compliant with
        <xref target="RFC3306"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3956"></xref>.</t>
