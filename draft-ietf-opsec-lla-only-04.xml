    <abstract>
      <t>In an IPv6 network it is possible to use only link-local addresses on
      infrastructure links between routers. This document discusses the
      advantages and disadvantages of this approach to help the decision
      process for a given network.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>An infrastructure link between a set of routers typically does not
      require global or even <xref target="RFC4193">unique local
      addressing</xref>. Using only link-local addressing on such links has a
      number of advantages, for example that routing tables do not need to
      carry link addressing, and can therefore be significantly smaller. This
      helps to decrease failover times in certain routing convergence events.
      An interface of a router is also not reachable beyond the link
      boundaries, therefore reducing the attack horizon.</t>

      <t>This document discusses the advantages and caveats of this
      approach.</t>

      <t>Note: <xref target="RFC6860"/> describes another approach for OPSFv2
      and OSPFv3 by modifying the existing protocols while this document does
      not modify any protocol but works only for IPv6.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="using"
             title="Using Link-Local Address on Infrastructure Links"
             toc="default">
      <t>This document discusses the approach of using only link-local
      addresses (LLA) on all router interfaces on infrastructure links.
      Routers typically need to receive packets neither from hosts, nor from
      nodes outside the network. For an network operator there may be reasons
      to use greater than link-local scope addresses on infrastructure
      interfaces for certain operational tasks, for example pings to an
      interface or traceroutes across the network. This document discusses
      such cases and proposes alternative procedures.</t>

      <section anchor="approach" title="The Approach" toc="default">
        <t>Neither global IPv6 addresses nor unique local addresses are
        configured on infrastructure links. In the absence of specific global
        or unique local address definitions, the default behavior of routers
        is to use link-local addresses notably for routing protocols.</t>

        <t>The sending of <xref target="RFC4443">ICMPv6</xref> error messages
        (packet-too-big, time-exceeded...) is required for routers, therefore
        another interface must be configured with an IPv6 address with a
        greater scope than link-local. This will usually be a loopback
        interface with a global scope address belonging to the operator and
        part of an announced prefix (with a suitable prefix length) to avoid
        being dropped by other routers implementing <xref target="RFC3704"/>.
        For the remainder of this document we will refer to this interface as
        a "loopback interface". <xref target="RFC6724"/> mandates that greater
        than link-local scope IPv6 addresses must be used as the source IPv6
        address for all generated ICMPv6 messages sent to a non link-local
        address.</t>

        <t>The effect on specific traffic types is as follows:<list
            style="symbols">
            <t>Control plane protocols, such as BGP <xref target="RFC4271"/>,
            ISIS <xref target="IS-IS"/>, OSPFv3 <xref target="RFC5340"/>,
            RIPng <xref target="RFC2080"/>, PIM <xref target="RFC4609"/> work
            by default or can be configured to work with link-local
            addresses.</t>

            <t>Management plane traffic, such as SSH <xref target="RFC4251"/>,
            Telnet <xref target="RFC0495"/>, SNMP <xref target="RFC1157"/>,
            and ICMP echo request <xref target="RFC4443"/>, can use as
            destination address the address of the router loopback interface.
            Router management can also be done over out-of-band channels.</t>

            <t>ICMP error message can be sourced from a loopback interface.
            They must not be sourced from link-local addresses when the
            destination is non link-local. See <xref target="RFC6724"/>.</t>

            <t>Data plane traffic is forwarded independently of the link
            address type.</t>

            <t>Neighbor discovery (neighbor solicitation and neighbor
            advertisement) is done by using link-local unicast and multicast
            addresses, therefore neighbor discovery is not affected.</t>
          </list>We therefore conclude that it is possible to construct a
        working network in this way.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="advantages" title="Advantages" toc="default">
        <t>Smaller routing tables: Since the routing protocol only needs to
        carry one global address (the loopback interface) per router, it is
        smaller than the traditional approach where every infrastructure link
        addresses are carried in the routing protocol. This reduces memory
        consumption, and increases the convergence speed in some routing
        failover cases (notably because the Forwarding Information Base to be
        downloaded to line cards is smaller but also because there are less
        prefixes in the Routing Information Base hence accelerating the
        routing algorithm). Note: smaller routing tables can also be achieved
        by putting interfaces in passive mode for the IGP.</t>

        <t>Reduced attack surface: Every routable address on a router
        constitutes a potential attack point: a remote attacker can send
        traffic to that address, for example a TCP SYN flood (see <xref
        target="RFC4987"/>), or can attempt SSH brute force password attacks.
        If a network only uses the addresses of the router loopback
        interface(s), only those need to be protected from outside the
        network. This may ease protection measures, such as infrastructure
        access control lists.</t>

        <t>Without using link-local addresses, it is still possible to achieve
        the same result if the network addressing scheme is set up such that
        all link and loopback interfaces have greater than link-local
        addresses and are aggregatable, and if the infrastructure access list
        covers that entire aggregated space. See also <xref target="RFC6752"/>
        for further discussion on this topic.</t>

        <t>Lower configuration complexity: link-local addresses require no
        specific configuration, thereby lowering the complexity and size of
        router configurations. This also reduces the likelihood of
        configuration mistakes.</t>

        <t>Simpler DNS: Less routable address space in use also means less
        reverse and forward mapping DNS resource records to maintain.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="caveats" title="Caveats" toc="default">
        <t>Interface ping: if an interface doesn't have a routable address, it
        can only be pinged from a node on the same link. Therefore it is not
        possible to ping a specific link interface remotely. A possible
        workaround is to ping the loopback address of a router instead. In
        most cases today it is not possible to see which link the packet was
        received on; however, <xref target="RFC5837">RFC5837</xref> suggests
        to include the interface identifier of the interface a packet was
        received on in the ICMP response; it must be noted that there are few
        implementions of this ICMP extension. With this approach it would be
        possible to ping a router on the addresses of loopback interfaces, yet
        see which interface the packet was received on. To check liveliness of
        a specific interface it may be necessary to use other methods, for
        example to connect to the router via SSH and to check locally or use
        SNMP.</t>

        <t>Traceroute: similar to the ping case, a reply to a traceroute
        packet would come from the address of a loopback interface, and
        current implementations do not display the specific interface the
        packets came in on. Also here, <xref target="RFC5837">RFC5837</xref>
        provides a solution.</t>

        <t>Hardware dependency: LLAs are usually EUI-64 based, hence, they
        change when the MAC address is changed. This could pose problem in a
        case where the routing neighbor must be configured explicitly (e.g.
        BGP) and a line card needs to be physically replaced hence changing
        the EUI-64 LLA and breaking the routing neighborship. But, LLAs can be
        statically configured such as fe80::1 and fe80::2 which can be used to
        configure any required static routing neighborship. This static
        configuration is similar in complexity to statically configured
        greater than link-local addresses, however, it is only required where
        routing peers are explicitly configured.</t>

        <t>Network Management System (NMS) toolkits: if there is any NMS tool
        that makes use of interface IP address of a router to carry out any of
        NMS functions, then it would no longer work, if the interface is
        missing routable address. A possible workaround for such tools is to
        use the routable address of the router loopback interface instead.
        Most vendor implementations allow the specification of the address of
        the loopback interfaces for SYSLOG, IPfix, SNMP. LLDP (IEEE
        802.1AB-2009) runs directly over Ethernet and does not require any
        IPv6 address so dynamic network discovery is not hindered when using
        LLDP. But, network discovery based on NDP cache content will only
        display the link-local addresses and not the addresses of the loopback
        interfaces; therefore, network discovery should rather be based on the
        Route Information Base to detect adjacent nodes.</t>

        <t>MPLS and RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC3209"/> allows establishing MPLS
        LSP on a path that is explicitly identified by a strict sequence of IP
        prefixes or addresses (each pertaining to an interface or a router on
        the path). This is commonly used for Fast Re-Route (FRR). However, if
        an interface uses only a link-local address, then such LSPs cannot be
        established. At the time of writing this document, there is no
        workaround for this case; therefore where RSVP-TE is being used, the
        approach described in this document does not work.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Internet Exchange Points">
        <t>Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) have a special importance in the
        global Internet, because they connect a high number of networks in a
        single location, and because significant part of Internet traffic pass
        through at least one IXP. An IXP with all the service provider nodes
        requires therefore a very high level of security. The address space
        used on an IXP is generally known, as it is registered in the global
        Internet Route Registry, or it is easily discoverable through
        traceroute. The IXP prefix is especially critical, because practically
        all addresses on this prefix are critical systems in the Internet.</t>

        <t>Apart from general device security guidelines, there are generally
        two additional ways to raise security (see also <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-opsec-bgp-security"/>): <list style="numbers">
            <t>Not to announce the prefix in question, and</t>

            <t>To drop all traffic destined to the IXP prefixes from traffic
            from remote locations.</t>
          </list>Not announcing the prefix of the IXP however would frequently
        result in traceroute and similar packets (required for PMTUd) to be
        dropped due to uRPF checks. Given that PMTUd is critical, this is
        generally not acceptable. Dropping all external traffic to the IXP
        prefix is hard to implement, because if only one service provider on
        an IXP routes does not filter correctly, then all IXP routers are
        reachable from at least that service provider network.</t>

        <t>As the prefix used in IXP is usually longer than a /48 it is
        frequently dropped by route filters on the Internet having the same
        net effect as not announced the prefix.</t>

        <t>Using link-local addresses on the IXP may help in this scenario. In
        this case, the generated ICMP packets would be generated from loopback
        interfaces or from any other interfaces with globally routable sources
        without any configuration. However in this case, each service provider
        would use his own address space, making a generic attack against all
        devices on the IXP harder. Also all the addresses of the loopback
        interfaces on the IXP can be discovered by a potential attacker by a
        simple traceroute; a generic attack is therefore still possible, but
        it would require more work.</t>

        <t>In some cases service providers carry the IXP addresses in their
        IGP for certain forms of traffic engineering across multiple exit
        points. If link-local addresses are used, these cannot be used for
        this purpose; in this case, the service provider would have to employ
        other methods of traffic engineering.</t>

        <t>If an Internet Exchange Point is using a global prefix registered
        for this purpose, a traceroute will indicate whether the trace crosses
        an IXP rather than a private interconnect. If link local addressing is
        used instead, a traceroute will not provide this distinction.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Summary" toc="default">
        <t>Using link-local addressing only on infrastructure links has a
        number of advantages, such as a smaller routing table size and a
        reduced attack surface. It also simplifies router configurations.
        However, the way certain network management tasks are carried out
        today has to be adapted to provide the same level of detail, for
        example interface identifiers in traceroute.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Using LLAs only on infrastructure links reduces the attack surface of
      a router: addresses of loopback interfaces with routed addresses are
      still reachable and must be secured, but infrastructure links can only
      be attacked from the local link. This simplifies security of control and
      management planes. The approach does not impact the security of the data
      plane. This approach does not address <xref target="RFC6192">control
      plane</xref> attacks generated by data plane packets (such as hop-limit
      expiration or packets containing a hop-by-hop extension header).</t>

      <t>As in the traditional approach, this approach relies on the
      assumption that all routers can be trusted due to physical and
      operational security.</t>
