          RADIUS Extensions for Key Management in WLAN network
                   draft-xue-radext-key-management-00

Abstract

   In order to guarantee the security and integration of the subscriber
   in WLAN network, Pairwise Master Key (PMK) will be generated as an
   access authorization token during the mutual authentication procedure
   between station (STA) and authenticator server (AS).  Then, the PMK
   and 4-way handshake are used between STA and Authenticator to derive,
   bind and verify the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK), which is a
   collection of operational keys for security.  Also,Group Transient
   Key (GTK) can be derived, and is used to secure multicast/broadcast
   traffic.  In the authentication architecture, only STA and AS can
   manufacture PMK, moreover, AS can only distribute PMK to
   Authenticator.However, if the authenticator function is not
   collocated with the encryption/decryption function, it is difficult
   to achieve traffic encryption/decryption in WLAN network.The purpose
   of this document is to analyze the requirement and issue for key
   management that have arisen so far during STA authentication process
   in WLAN network.  Meanwhile, the control messages for key management
   are defined.

1.  Introduction

   The Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) is becoming very popular,
   which is used in many industries (the financial, medical, and
   manufacturing, etc).  It features low cost and flexible network, and
   high speed wireless data access with open spectrum.  Besides, the
   WLAN technology is now used by more and more service operators to
   supplement cellular (2G/3G/LTE) network.

   In order to enhance the user experience, the perception-free
   authentication for WLAN network is preferred.  Additionally, for
   operators, it is the trend to do unified authentication together with
   2G/3G/LTE network, especially for user equipment with (U)SIM.
   EAP[RFC3748] based authentication methods are widely deployed in WLAN
   network.  EAP is end-to-end transport for authentication framework
   between Supplicant and Authentication Server (AS).

   Based on the WLAN security requirements mentioned in [IEEE-802.11i],
   keying material used for encryption and integrity algorithms must be
   obtained in the uniform authentication procedure.  Fortunately,
   802.11i implements a key derivation/management regime.  During the
   mutual authentication procedure between STA and AS, Pairwise Master
   Key (PMK) will be generated as a side effect.  The PMK,which is a
   fresh symmetric key.  Then, the PMK and 4-way handshake
   [IEEE-802.11i]are used to derive, bind and verify the Pairwise
   Transient Key (PTK), which is a collection of operational keys for
   secure between STA and encryption/decryption node.  Also,Group
   Transient Key (GTK) can be derived, and is used to secure multicast/
   broadcast traffic between STA and encryption/decryption node.

   In the authentication architecture, only STA and AS can manufacture
   PMK, moreover, AS distributes PMK to to Authenticator.However, if the
   authenticator function is not collocated with the encryption/
   decryption function, it is difficult to achieve traffic encryption/
   decryption in WLAN network.For example, the authenticator is deployed
   on Gateway (GW) node, whereas, the encryption/decryption node always
   WTP or AC.The purpose of this document is to analyze the requirement
   and issue for key management that have arisen so far during
   authentication process in WLAN network.  Meanwhile, the control
   messages for key management are defined.

   The specification described in this document is applicable if
   authenticator function is not collocated with the encryption/
   decryption function in WLAN.  It is recommended for WLAN network
   deployment as informational.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terminologies.

   Wireless Termination Point (WTP)

   The physical or logical network entity that contains an RF antenna
   and wireless physical layer (PHY) to transmit and receive station
   traffic for wireless access networks.  This definition has the same
   meaning used in [RFC4118].

   Access Controller (AC)

   The network entity that provides WTP access to the network
   infrastructure in the data plane, control plane, management plane, or
   a combination therein, as defined in [RFC4118]

   Authentication Server(AS)

   An entity that provides an authentication service to an
   authenticator.  This service determines, from the credentials
   provided by the Supplicant, whether the Supplicant is authorized to
   access the services provided by the system in which the authenticator
   resides.  AS is generally located on the backend AAA server.

   Authenticator

   An entity that facilitates authentication of other entities attached
   to the same LAN.  The term authenticator is also used in [RFC3748],
   and has the same meaning in this document.

   Gateway (GW)

   A device in operator access network, who can charge the subscriber
   authentication.  It maybe BRAS (Broadband Remote Access Server) or
   BNG (Broadband Network Gateway).

   Supplicant

   A device at one end of a point-to-point LAN segment seeks to be
   authenticated by an Authenticator.  It is the same as the Peer

Internet-Draft          key management via radius          February 2013


   defined in [RFC3748].  The supplicant is station (STA) in WLAN
   network.  It can be user equipment (UE) device.  We can also call the
   supplicant as subscriber.

   Station (STA)

   A device that contains an interface to a wireless medium.  User
   equipment (UE) with (U)SIM is one type of STA.  In authentication
   procedure, STA is deployed as the Supplicant.

   Pairwise Master Key (PMK)

   PMK is a fresh symmetric key controlling STA's and the encryption/
   decryption node (WTP or AC) access to 802.11 channel during the
   session.

   Pairwise Transient Key (PTK)

   PTK is used to encrypt/decrypt unicast traffic for supplicant, which
   is derived from the 4-way handshake [IEEE-802.11i].

   Group Temporal Key (GTK)

   GTK is used to encrypt/decrypt multicast/broadcast traffic for
   supplicant, which is derived from the 4-way handshake[IEEE-802.11i].


4.  Problem Statement

4.1.  802.1x/EAP Operation

   As a generic authentication framework, EAP[RFC3748] can be used
   combined with some payload protocols.  In WLAN network, EAP is
   carried over authentication protocol such as RADIUS
   [RFC2865][RFC2866][RFC3579].  An example for end-to-end EAP procedure
   in context of WLAN is shown as following figure 1.

                       Figure 1 802.1x/EAP Operation

   In the 802.1x/EAP authentication framework, there are three entities
   acting as follows.

   o  Supplicant: The end of the link that responds to the
      authenticator, as well same meaning as the peer mentioned in
      [RFC3748] .  In this document, STA is one type of supplicant, it
      could be User equipment (UE) with (U)SIM ,etc.

   o  Authenticator: An entity that facilitates authentication of other
      entities attached to the same LAN, defined in[RFC3748].  In the
      existing WLAN, whichever WTP, AC or Service Gateway could be
      deployed as Authenticator based on operator's requirement.

   o  Authenticator Server: An entity that provides an authentication
      service to an authenticator.  This service determines, from the
      credentials provided by the supplicant, whether the supplicant is
      authorized to access the services provided by the system in which
      the authenticator resides.  As mentioned in [IEEE-802.1X], the

      Authentication Server function can be co-located with an
      Authenticator, or it can be accessed remotely via a network to
      which an Authenticator has access.  In this document, we assume
      the Authenticator server isn't co-located with the Authenticator.
      Always, AAA server is the Authenticator Server.

   Actually, there are several possibilities of entities deployment in
   WLAN, especially the Authenticator.  Also sometimes the authenticator
   is a standalone device which doesn't support encryption/decryption
   function.  In the next sub-section, the possibilities of entities
   deployment in typically WLAN are described .

4.2.  Possibility of Authentication Entities in WLAN

   Based on the WTP type in WLAN, which is an intelligent device or a
   little more than radio-for-wire media converter, some industry
   analyses have oversimplified the WLAN architecture into two
   categories.  They are WTP autonomous management architecture and WTP
   centralized management architecture.  The previous type of WTP is
   also called as "FAT AP".  The FAT AP is a standalone device
   responsible for all WLAN functionality, such as encryption/
   decryption, authentication, etc.  Instead, the other type of WTP is
   always defined as FIT AP.  The FIT AP is a radio-for-wire media
   converter.  The WTPs will be managed by Access Controller (AC).

   In the autonomous architecture, each of the WTPs is managed by itself
   independently, as shown in Figure 2.

   In this case, the authentication entities is deployed as:

   o  Supplicant: STA

   o  Authenticator: WTP, also providing encryption/decryption function.

   o  AS: AAA server as general.

    | STA  |  /-/ | WTP  +-------------+  GW  +----+ Service |
    |      |      |      |             |      |    |         |
    +------+      +------+             +------+     \-------/


                     Figure 2 Autonomous Architecture

   Comparatively, in the centralized management architecture, WTPs have
   less functions and added Access Controller (AC) is responsible for
   configuration, control and management of WTPs.  The 802.11 function

   splits between WTP and the Access Controller (AC) in this
   architecture.Figure 3 shows an example of a centralized management
   network.

   In this case, the authentication entities is deployed as:

   o  Supplicant: STA

   o  Authenticator: WTP/AC/GW, but only WTP/AC can provide encryption/
      decryption function.

   o  AS: AAA server as general.

                     Figure 3 Centralized Architecture

   As described in previous section, only authenticator can obtain the
   PMK during the authentication.  Meanwhile the PMK and 4-way handshake
   [IEEE-802.11i]are used to derive, bind and verify the Pairwise
   Transient Key (PTK), which is a collection of operational keys for
   secure between STA and encryption/decryption node.  Also,Group
   Transient Key (GTK) can be derived, and is used to secure multicast/
   broadcast traffic between STA and encryption/decryption node.  In the
   centralized architecture, if the authenticator function is deployed
   on GW node, not collocated with the encryption/decryption function,
   it is difficult to achieve traffic encryption/decryption in WLAN
   network.

   Actually, it is a general case in existing network because AC isn't
   intelligent enough to aggregate all the WLAN critical functions in
   one.  Consequently, It is a popular scenario to split the
   authentication function from AC to GW, which is the existing
   authentication gateway for other service, such as PPP, etc.  This
   enables a better environment that diminishes the software and



Xue                      Expires August 22, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          key management via radius          February 2013


   hardware upgrade for operator.  In this scenario, the issues for key
   management arises.  For the following discussion, the problem
   statement is introduced for key management during STA's
   authentication process in centralized architecture.

4.3.  Problem Statement

   Pairwise Master Key (PMK) will be generated as an access
   authorization token during the mutual authentication procedure
   between STA and AS to guarantee the security requirement in WLAN.
   Then, PTK and GTK will be generated via PMK and 4-way
   handshake[IEEE-802.11i].  PTK/GTK is used to secure STA's unicast/
   (broadcast/multicast) traffic between STA and ecryption/decryption
   node, which could be WTP or AC.

   Unfortunately, in exiting authentication procedure, authenticator is
   the only node which can obtain the derived PMK,except of STA and AS.
   In addition, authenticator is not always deployed collocated on
   ecryption/decryption node.  That is to say, WTP/AC cannot implement
   STA's traffic encryption/decryption because of lacking the PMK
   information.  In this case, mechanism is needed to inform the PMK to
   ecryption/decryption node, WTP or AC in WLAN.

   In practice, this case is likely to happen in WLAN.  Sometimes, AC in
   the existing network, kind of enterprise device, isn't the high
   intelligent devices to aggregate all the WLAN critical intelligent
   function in one.  For operator, it is costly in large-scale ungraded
   deployment.  As result, authentication is always deployed on GW node
   instead of AC.  Fortunately, the GW node is the potential node for
   authentication in real network for other subscriber such as PPP, etc.
   It is good at Authenticator function.  This enables a better
   environment that diminishes the software and hardware upgrade risks .

   Based on the above analysis, because of lack the initial fresh
   symmetric key for encryption/decryption, it is challenge for WTP/AC
   to control the 802.11 channel with STA, as shown in figure 4.  The
   problem must be resolved.

    Figure 4 Authentication procedure when GW deployed as Authenticator


5.  Protocol overview

   Based on the analysis above, it is recommended that control messages
   used for PMK transported from GW to WTP/AC in order to support
   encryption requirement between STA and WTP/AC when GW is the
   Authenticator.

   If AC is the encryption/decryption node, the GW can send the PMK to
   AC via these control messages.  If WTP is the encryption/decryption
   node, the GW can use send the PMK to AC as well, then AC sends the
   obtained PMK to AP via protocol defined in [RFC4564].  The control
   messages between GW and AC is defined in this version.  The purpose
   of this section is to provide control procedure and packet definition
   for key management in centralized architecture.  Moreover, the
   control messages must fix the issues without creating
   incompatibilities with deployed implementation.

   As we know, RADIUS attributes are comprised of variable length Type-

   Length-Vaule 3 tuples.  New attribute values can be added without
   disturbing existing implementation of the protocol.  RADIUS packet is
   one option.This document describes the RADIUS attributes supporting
   the key transmit between GW (Authenticator) and WTP/AC.  Specially,
   RADIUS commands (Key-of-Announcement, KoA-ACK/NAK) are defined in
   order to enable PMK to be send from Authenticator (GW) to AC.  These
   extended commends trigged by the RADIUS Accept message during
   authentication procedure.New RADIUS attributes for PMK announcement
   are described.

   The PMK announcement packets contain PMK derived by AS during the
   authentication procedure.  Typically, this is used to achieve PMK
   announcement from GW to AC.  Based on the exchanged keying material,
   the traffic security and integration requirement between STA and
   WTP/AC can be fixed.

   The PMK Announcement packets are defined as below.

                    Figure 5 PMK Announcement Messages

   During the authentication procedure, when GW obtains the PMK key via
   RADIUS Accept Message from AS, the GW initiates the KoA message and
   send to AC.  The AC responds the KoA message with KoA-ACK if the AC
   is able to successfully get the PMK for the subscriber, or KoA-NAK if
   the PMK announcement fail.

   2 After EAP authentication completes, the GW works as Authenticator
   initiates and transmits the KoA packet to AC.  It is desirable to
   provide keying information needed based on [IEEE-802.11i].To
   accomplish this, the KoA message contains the attributes to provide
   the PMK to AC.

   within the KoA message as an indication that the server has
   successfully authenticated the STA.  Additionally, the derived PMK
   during authentication can be used with 4-Way Handshake to derive,
   bind, and verify PTK or GTK.  The 4-way handshake procedure is
   defined in IEEE, which is out of the scope.


7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD


8.  Security Considerations

   Right now, the AS is only trusted to transport PMK to the
   Authenticator which was established with the supplicant.  So if the
   Authenticator need to announce the PMK to the third parities, except
   the supplicant, the security must be guaranteed between the GW and
   the AC for key announcement.  It can be achieved by IPsec tunnel or
   MD5 encryption/decryption algorithm.
