<t> 
RFC 3484 defines default address selection mechanisms for IPv6 that
allow nodes to select appropriate address when faced with multiple 
source and/or destination addresses to choose between.  The RFC 3484
allowed for the future definition of methods to administratively 
configure the address selection policy information. This document
defines a new DHCPv6 option for such configuration, allowing a site
administrator to distribute address selection policy overriding the
default address selection parameters and policy table, and thus 
control the address selection behavior of nodes in their site.

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
RFC 3484 <xref target="RFC3484"/> describes default algorithms
for selecting an address when a node has multiple destination and/or 
source addresses to choose from by using an address selection policy.  
In Section 2 of RFC 3484, it is suggested that the default policy table
may be administratively configured to suit the specific needs of a site.
This specification defines a new DHCPv6 option for such configuration.
</t>
<t>
	Some problems have been identified with the default RFC 3484 address
	selection policy <xref target="RFC5220"/>.
It is unlikely that any default policy will suit all scenarios, and thus
mechanisms to control the source address selection policy will be 
necessary.  Requirements for those mechanisms are described in <xref
target="RFC5221"/>, while solutions are discussed
in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-sol"/> and 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-considerations"/>. Those 
documents have helped shape the improvements in 
the default address selection algorithm <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484bis"/> as well as the DHCPv6
option defined in this specification.

<section title="Processing the Policy Table option">
	<t>
	This section describes how to process received
	Policy Table option at the DHCPv6 client.
	</t>
	<t>
	This option's concept is to serve as a hint for
	a node about how to behave in the network.
	So, basically, it should be up to the node's administrator
	how to deal with the received policy information in the way described below.
	</t>

	<section title="Handling of the local policy table">
		<t>
		RFC 3484 defines the default policy table.
		Also, a user is usually able to configure the policy table
		to satisfy his requirement.
		</t>
		<t>
		The client implementation SHOULD provide the following choices
		to the user:
		</t>
		<t>
		<list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="a)">
		It receives distributed policy table, and replaces
		 the existing policy tables with that.
			</t>
			<t hangText="b)">
		It preserves the default policy table, or manually
		 configured policy.
			</t>
		</list>
		</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Handling of the stale policy table">
		<t>
			When the information from the DHCP server goes stale,
			the policy received form the DHCP server should be
			removed and the default policy should be restored.
		</t>
		<t>
			The received information can be considered stale in
			several cases, such as, when the interface goes down,
			the DHCP server does not respond for a certain amount
			of time, and the Information Refresh Time is expired.
		</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Processing multiple received policies">
		<t>
		The policy table, and other parameters specified in this document
		are node-global information by its nature.
		So, the node cannot use multiple received policies at
		the same time. 
		In other words, once the received policy from one source is
		merged with another source, the policy is more or less changed.
		The policy table is defined as a whole, so the slightest
		addition/deletion from the policy table brings a change in
		semantics of the policy.
		</t>
		<t>
		It also should be noted that, when a node is
		single-homed and has only one upstream line,
		adopting a received policy table does not degrade the security
		level.
		</t>
		<t>
		Under the above assumptions, how to handle multiple
		received policies is specified below.
		</t>
		<t>
		   A node MAY use Address Selection options in any of the following two
		   cases:
		</t>
		<t>
		<list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="1:">
		The Address Selection option is delivered across the only secure,
		trusted channel.
			</t>
			<t hangText="2:">
		The Address Selection option delivery is not secured, but the node
		is single-homed.
			</t>
		</list>
		</t>
		<t>
		In other cases the node MUST NOT use Policy Table options
		unless the node is specifically configured to do so.
		</t>
		<t>
			<list style='hanging'>
			<t hangText="Discussion:">
			The secure trusted channel does not necessarily mean
			a prioritized route in the routing table.
			So, such a situation could happen that the traffic goes through a
			non-secure, non-trusted channel and the host follows the
			delivered policy from a secure, truested channel.
			However, this policy is not for optimization of traffic and
			resources at the local network and the hosts, but for
			implementing the network policy to the hosts in the network.
			</t>
			</list>

<section title="Implementation Considerations">

<t>
<list style='symbols'>
<t>
The value 'label' is passed as an unsigned integer, but there is no
special meaning for the value, that is whether it is a large or small
number.  It is used to select a preferred source address prefix
corresponding to a destination address prefix by matching the same
label value within the DHCP message. DHCPv6 clients need to convert this
label to a representation specified by each implementation (e.g.,
string).
<vspace blankLines='1' />
</t>

<t>
Currently, the label and precedence values are defined
as 8-bit unsigned integers. In almost all cases, this value will be
enough.
<vspace blankLines='1' />
</t>

<t>
The maximum number of address selection rules that may be conveyed 
in one DHCPv6 message depends 
on the prefix length of each rule and the maximum DHCPv6 message
size defined in RFC 3315. It is possible to carry over 3,000 rules
in one DHCPv6 message (maximum UDP message size).
However, it should not be expected that DHCP clients, servers and
relay agents can handle UDP fragmentation.
So, the number of the options and the total size of the options should
be taken care of.
<vspace blankLines='1' />
</t>

<t>
Since the number of selection rules could be large, an administrator
configuring the policy to be distributed should consider the resulting
DHCPv6 message size.
<vspace blankLines='1' />
</t>

</list></t>
</section>



<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>
   A rogue DHCPv6 server could issue bogus address selection
   policies to a client. This might lead to incorrect address selection
   by the client, and the affected packets might be blocked at an
   outgoing ISP because of ingress filtering.  Alternatively, an IPv6
   transition mechanism might be preferred over native IPv6, even if
   it is available.
	To guard against such attacks, a legitimate DHCPv6 server should
	be communicated through a secure, trusted channel, such as a channel
	protected by IPsec, SEND and DHCP authentication, as described in
	section 21 of RFC 3315,
</t>

<t>
	Another threat is about privacy concern.
	As in the security consideration section of RFC 3484, at least
	a part of, the address selection policy stored in a host
	can be leaked by a packet from a remote host.
	This issue will not be degraded regardless of the introduction
	of this option, or regardless of whether the host is multihomed or not.
</t>
</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

<t>
IANA is requested to assign option codes to OPTION_ADDRSEL
, OPTION_ADDRSEL_TABLE, and OPTION_ADDRSEL_ZONE from the
option-code space as defined in section "DHCPv6 Options" of RFC 3315.

The 'zone index' value is used to specify a particular zone for scoped
addresses. This can be used effectively to control address selection
in the site scope (e.g., to tell a node to use a specified source
address corresponding to a site-scoped multicast address). However, in
some cases such as a link-local scope address, the value specifying
one zone is only meaningful locally within that node. There might be
some cases where the administrator knows which clients are on the
network and wants specific interfaces to be used though. However,
in general case, it is hard to use this value. 
<vspace blankLines='1' />
</t>

<t>
Since we got a comment that some implementations use 32-bit integers
for zone index value, we extended the bit length of the 'zone index'
field. However, as described above, there might be few
cases to specify 'zone index' in policy distribution, we defined
this field as optional, controlled by a flag. 
<vspace blankLines='1' />
</t>

<t>
There may be some demands to control the use of special address types
such as the temporary addresses described in RFC4941 <xref
target="RFC4941"/>, address assigned by DHCPv6 and so on.  (e.g.,

the type of addresses using reserved field value.
