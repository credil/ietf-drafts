INTERNET DRAFT             MPLS-TP OAM ID MIB              June 18, 2013


1  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling a
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031] based transport
   profile.

   This MIB module should be used for performing the OAM operations for
   MPLS LSPs, Pseudowires and Sections.

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC2578, STD 58, RFC2579 and STD58, RFC2580.

3. Overview

3.1 Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

3.2 Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the Multiprotocol Label Switching
   Architecture [RFC3031], Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic
   Engineering (TE)Management Information Base (MIB)[RFC3812], 
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switching Router (LSR)
   Management Information Base (MIB)[RFC3813], Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance Framework for MPLS-Based Transport
   Networks [RFC6371], MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Identifiers
   [RFC6370], MPLS-TP Identifiers Following ITU-T Conventions [RFC6923],
   and OAM in MPLS Transport Networks [RFC5860].

4. Feature List

   The MPLS transport profile OAM identifiers MIB module is designed
   to satisfy the following requirements and constraints:

      -  The MIB module supports configuration of OAM identifiers for
         point-to-point, co-routed bidirectional, associated
         bidirectional MPLS tunnels and MPLS Pseudowires.


5. Brief description of MIB Objects

   The objects described in this section support the functionality
   described in documents [RFC5654] and [RFC6370].  The tables support
   both IP compatible and ICC based OAM identifiers configurations
   for MPLS Tunnels and Pseudowires.

5.1.  mplsOamIdMegTable

   The mplsOamIdMegTable is used to manage one or more
   Maintenance Entities (MEs) that belongs to the same transport path.

   When a new entry is created with mplsOamIdMegOperatorType set to
   ipCompatible (1), then as per [RFC6370] (MEG_ID for LSP
   is LSP_ID and MEG_ID for PW is PW_Path_ID), MEP_ID can be
   automatically formed.

   For ICC based transport path, the user is expected to configure
   the ICC identifier explicitly in this table for MPLS tunnels
   and pseudowires.

INTERNET DRAFT             MPLS-TP OAM ID MIB              June 18, 2013


5.2.  mplsOamIdMeTable


   The mplsOamIdMeTable defines a relationship between two points
   (source and sink) of a transport path to which maintenance and
   monitoring operations apply. The two points that define
   a maintenance entity are called Maintenance Entity Group
   End Points (MEPs).

   In between MEPs, there are zero or more intermediate points,
   called Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Points (MIPs).
   MEPs and MIPs are associated with the MEG and can be shared by
   more than one ME in a MEG.

6. MPLS OAM identifier configuration for MPLS tunnel example

   In this section, we provide an example of the OAM identifier
   configuration for an MPLS co-routed bidirectional tunnel.

   This example provides usage of a MEG and ME tables for management and
   monitoring operations of an MPLS tunnel.

   This example considers the OAM identifiers configuration on a
   head-end LSR to manage and monitor a MPLS tunnel.
   Only relevant objects which are applicable for IP based OAM
   identifiers of co-routed MPLS tunnel are illustrated here.

      In mplsOamIdMegTable:

      {
        -- MEG index (Index to the table)
        mplsOamIdMegIndex                 = 1,
        mplsOamIdMegName                  = "MEG1",
        mplsOamIdMegOperatorType          = ipCompatible (1),
        mplsOamIdMegServicePointerType    = lsp (1),
        mplsOamIdMegMpLocation            = perNode(1),
      -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
        mplsOamIdMegRowStatus             = createAndGo (4),
        mplsOamIdMegPathFlow      
                             = coRoutedBidirectionalPointToPoint (2)
      }

      This will create an entry in the mplsOamIdMegTable to manage and
      monitor the MPLS tunnel.

      The following ME table is used to associate the path information
      to a MEG.

              A ME is a p2p entity. One ME has two such MEPs.
              A MEG is a group of one or more MEs. One MEG can have
              two or more MEPs.

              For P2P LSP, one MEG has one ME and this ME is associated
              two MEPs (source and sink MEPs) within a MEG.
              Each mplsOamIdMeIndex value denotes the ME within a MEG.

              In case of unidirectional point-to-point transport paths,
              a single unidirectional Maintenance Entity is defined to
              monitor it and mplsOamIdMeServicePointer points to
              unidirectional point-to-point path.

              In case of associated bidirectional point-to-point
              transport paths, two independent unidirectional
              Maintenance Entities are defined to independently monitor
              each direction and each mplsOamIdMeServicePointer MIB
              object points to unique unidirectional transport path.
              This has implications for transactions that terminate at
              or query a MIP, as a return path from MIP to source MEP
              does not necessarily exist within the MEG.

              In case of co-routed bidirectional point-to-point
              transport paths, a single bidirectional Maintenance Entity
              is defined to monitor both directions congruently and
              mplsOamIdMeServicePointer MIB object points to co-routed

8. Security Consideration

   There is a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   that has a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-create. Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment
   without proper protection can have a negative effect on network
   operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects
   with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access
   to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
   objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.  These are
   the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network
   is allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)
   the objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full supports for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
   (for authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principles (users) that have legitimate

   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an OID for the MIB module from the "MIB
   Transmission Group - MPLS STD" sub-registry of the "Internet-standard
   MIB - Transmission Group" registry for the MPLS-TP OAM ID MIB module
   specified in this document.
