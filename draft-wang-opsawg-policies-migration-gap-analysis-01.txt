       Survey and Gap Analysis for State Migration in Data Center
          draft-wang-opsawg-policies-migration-gap-analysis-01

Abstract

   In this draft, we made gap analysis with some exisitng IETF work that
   could be related to State Migration.  First of all, a short
   description of general state migration requirements is listed, and
   then we presents a brief survey of MIDCOM, PCP and Forces.  The goal
   of this draft is to figure out whether there are existing protocols
   we can reuse.

Internet-Draft                 GapAnalysis                  October 2011


1.  Introduction

   In this draft, we made gap analysis with some exisitng IETF work that
   could be related to State Migration.  For any new proposal to IETF,
   we should try to find out whether there is exixting mechanism and
   protocols can be reused to solve the proposed problem.  So, in this
   draft, we analyze some existing IETF work, including Middlebox
   Communication [MIDCOM], Port Control Protocol[PCP] and Forwarding and
   Control Element Separation .  [ForCES]We are happy to be noticed
   about and make analysis on other possible IETF work.

   Before we can figure out whether an existing work in IETF can be
   reused in StAte MIgration (SAMI), we need to first be aware of the
   requirements of SAMI.  So, before analyzing any existing IETF work,
   we list some general requirements on SAMI.


2.  Terminologies and concepts

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "WOULD",
   "COULD", "CANNOT", "MIGHT", and "MAY"in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Source device: the device from where the VM migrates.

   Destination device: the device to where the VM migrates.

   Migration pair, device-pair: a network device and its partner which
   involved in DIM.

   VM: Virtual Machine; A completely isolated operation system which is
   installed by software on a normal operation system.  A normal
   operation system can be virtualized into several VM.


3.  General Requirements on State Migration

      1) VM Migration Awareness: Be there a third party coordinator, the
      VM or the Firewall itself that is used to assist state
      migration[SAMI_SOLUTION_SURVEY], the state migration mechanism
      must be aware of VM Migration, in order to know VM migrates from
      where to where and when is the best time to migrate state.

      2) Authentication: In Cloud Data Center, not only servers but also
      clients are reside inside.  So it's not safe to assume that the
      request for state migration is from an authorized party, even if
      the request is from internal netowrk.  For security consideration,
      mutual authentication between network devices must be supported.

Internet-Draft                 GapAnalysis                  October 2011


      3) Capability Negotiation: The protocol must support capability
      negotiation between network devices before migration starts.  The
      goal of capability negotiation is to make sure the destination
      devices supports appropriate functions and has enough software
      resource to support the state which is going to be migrated.  For
      example, a source Firewall has 6 session table items to be
      migrated, while the destination Firewall has only 4 items
      available.  That implies the state migration could fail.  The
      source device can be aware of the situation by capability
      negotiation.  The manager can make decision on whether to continue
      VM migration with the awareness of the risk of failure.

      4) States Representation: Different Vendors could have different
      ways to represent states, e.g. the Firewall session table model of
      vendor A is different from that of vendor B. There are common
      parameters, e.g. all sesssion tatbles have 5 tuple (Src IP/Port,
      Dst IP/Port, Protocol type), but the naming and orders of the
      parameters could also be different.  And some vendor could contain
      some propriatary parameters.  In order to enable devices from
      different vendors can understand and transform the states to the
      one they support, there should be a standardized way to represent
      states

      5) Communication with Firewall: From the very rough consideration
      of the solution, there should be either there is a third party
      coordinator between two Firewalls to transfer states or a protocol
      to enable Firewalls to communicate with each other.

      6) State Elimination: Once state has been migrated successfully to
      destination device, it must be eliminated from source device in
      time, otherwise it might be taken advantage by malicious
      attackers.

      7) Atomicity: Since one device might be involved into several
      migrations simultaneously, migrations with different partners must
      be isolated to each other.  The migration lanched by one device
      must not be interrupted by migrations launched by other devices,
      which can ensure atomicity of migration interactions.

      8) Span Administration Domains: Since VM can be migrated to any
      place within Data Center, even to another Data Center that is not
      in the same administration domain from the original Data Center,
      the protocol should be able to apply in different scenarios.

      9) Extensibility: The protocol should be designed to be extensible
      to support migration of new state or between new network devices.

4.  Existing Protocol Gap Analysis

4.1.  MIDdlebox COMmunication (MIDCOM)

   The principal motivation behind architecting MIDCOM protocol is to
   enable complex applications pass through middleboxes, using a trusted
   third party, i.e., a MIDCOM agent.  MIDCOM agents with application
   intelligence can assist the middleboxes in permitting applications.
   Middleboxes supporting the MIDCOM will be able to externalize
   application intelligence into MIDCOM agents.

   The primary task for MIDCOM protocol is to assist agents in
   configuring policy rules on middleboxes.  Mutual authentication
   between agent and middlebox are provided for session establishment
   between them.

   MIDCOM protocol contains several concepts that DIM could refer to.
   However, there are still several requirements of DIM cannot be
   satisfied by MIDCOM protocol.  The following table lists the gaps in
   MIDCOM protocol on DIM.

         +------------------------------+------------------------+
         | State Migration Requirements | If Supported by MIDCOM |
         +------------------------------+------------------------+
         | VM Migration Awareness       | No                     |
         | Mutual authentication        | Yes                    |
         | Capability Negotiation       | No                     |
         | State Representation         | No                     |
         | Communication with Firewall  | Yes                    |
         | State Elimination            | No                     |
         | Atomicity                    | Yes                    |
         | Span Administration Domains  | No                     |
         +------------------------------+------------------------+

   Generally speaking, MIDCOM is developed for policies configuration on
   Middleboxes.  It doesn't deal with the state generated on
   Middleboxes, e.g. on Firewall.  It provides a way to communicate with
   Firewall.  But if we want to reuse MIDCOM, we need to develop the
   features listed above with "NO".

4.2.  Port Control Protocol (PCP)

   Port Control Protocol (PCP) is, to some extent, similar to MIDCOM.
   PCP is designed to enable host/gateway to establish explicit dialog
   with middlebox to open up and/or forward TCP or UDP port.
   Authentication mechanism is out of the scope of PCP, instead some
   restrictions are listted for implementation and deployment
   consideration.  [PCP_BASE]

          +------------------------------+---------------------+
          | State Migration Requirements | If Supported by PCP |
          +------------------------------+---------------------+
          | VM Migration Awareness       | No                  |
          | Mutual authentication        | No                  |
          | Capability Negotiation       | No                  |
          | State Representation         | No                  |
          | Communication with Firewall  | Yes                 |
          | State Elimination            | No                  |
          | Atomicity                    | Yes                 |
          | Span Administration Domains  | No                  |
          +------------------------------+---------------------+

   Generally speaking, PCP is developed to enable an IPv6 or IPv4 host
   to control how incoming IPv6 or IPv4 packets are translated and
   forwarded by a network address translator (NAT) or simple firewall,
   and also allows a host to optimize its outgoing NAT keepalive
   messages.policies configuration on Middleboxes.  It doesn't deal with
   the migration of state generated on Middleboxes, e.g. on Firewall.
   It provides a way to communicate with Firewall.  But if we want to
   reuse MIDCOM, we need to develop the features listed above with "NO".

4.3.  Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES)

   Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) aims to define a
   framework and associated mechanisms for standardizing the exchange of
   information between the logically separate functionality of the
   control plane, including entities such as routing protocols,
   admission control, and signaling, and the forwarding plane, where
   per-packet activities such as packet forwarding, queuing, and header
   editing occur.

   For current version of ForCES, Control Element (CE) and Forwarding
   Element (FE) should be no more than one hop away.  But ForCES is
   supposed to support information exchanging between CE and FE that are
   more than one hop away by making use of an existing RFC2914 compliant
   L4 protocol with adequate reliability, security and congestion
   control (e.g.  TCP, SCTP) for transport purposes.  Also, ForCES
   provides authentication and security mechanism for communication
   between CE and FE.

   Flow-coupled state, e.g. session table on Firewall, could be one type
   of information that is exchanged between CE and PE.

   In state migration scenario, let's suppose that CE is a third party
   coordinator and FE is the Firewall with lots of Logical Function
   Block (LFB).  According to , we can get the following gap analysis
   table. [ForCES_BASE_PROTOCOL]

Internet-Draft                 GapAnalysis                  October 2011


         +------------------------------+------------------------+
         | State Migration Requirements | If Supported by ForCES |
         +------------------------------+------------------------+
         | VM Migration Awareness       | No                     |
         | Mutual authentication        | Yes                    |
         | Capability Negotiation       | Yes                    |
         | State Representation         | No                     |
         | Communication with Firewall  | Yes                    |
         | State Elimination            | Yes                    |
         | Atomicity                    | Yes                    |
         | Span Administration Domains  | No                     |
         +------------------------------+------------------------+

   ForCES provides a good base for state migration.  But we need to
   redesign the roles of CE and FE, and need to resolve the 'No' items
   in the above table.  And because ForCES doesn't provide a non-stop
   tranferring of state, which only has GET and SET without none
   interruption consideration, we also need to develop a new mechanism
   to guarantee the state migration only introduce acceptable
   interruption time to VM live migration.
