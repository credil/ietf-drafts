    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>This document describes a routing scenario where IPv4 packets are
      transported over an IPv6 network, based on 
      <xref target="RFC6145" pageno="false" format="default"> </xref> and 
      <xref target="RFC6052" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>, 
      along with a separate OSPFv3 routing table for 
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 routes in the IPv6 network. This document does not
      introduce any new IPv6 transition mechanism.</t>
      <t>In this document the following terminology is used: <list style="symbols">
      <t>An IPv4-embedded IPv6 address denotes an IPv6 address which contains an 
      embedded 32-bit IPv4 address constructed according to the rules defined in 
      <xref target="RFC6052" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>.</t>
      <t>IPv4-embedded IPv6 packets are packets of which destination addresses are 
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses.</t><t>AFBR (Address Family Border Router, 
      <xref target="RFC5565" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>) refers to an 
      edge router, which supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address families, but the backbone 
      network it connects to only supports either the IPv4 or IPv6 address family.</t>
      <t>AFXLBR (Address Family Translation Border Router) is defined in this document. 
      It refers to a border router that supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address families,           located on the boundary of an IPv4-only network and an IPv6-only network, and is
      capable of performing IP header translation between IPv4 and IPv6 according to 
      <xref target="RFC6145" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>.</t></list></t>
      <t></t>
      
      <section anchor="scenario" title="The Scenario" toc="default">
      <t>Due to exhaustion of public IPv4 addresses, there has been
       a continuing effort within the IETF on IPv6 transitional techniques. In the
       course of the transition, it is certain that networks based on IPv4 and
       IPv6 technologies respectively, will co-exist at least for
       some time. One scenario of this co-existence is the inter-connection
       of IPv4-only and IPv6-only networks, and in particular, when an IPv6-only
       network serves as inter-connection between several segregated
       IPv4-only networks. In this scenario, IPv4 packets
       are transported over the IPv6 network between IPv4 networks.
       In order to forward an IPv4 packet from a source IPv4 network to the
       destination IPv4 network, IPv4 reachability information must be
       exchanged between the IPv4 networks by some mechanism.</t>
       <t>In general, running an IPv6-only network would
       reduce OPEX and optimize the operation compared to
       IPv4-IPv6 dual-stack environment. Some
       solutions have been proposed to allow delivery of IPv4 services over
       an IPv6-only network. This document focuses on an engineering
       technique which aims to separate the routing table dedicated to
       IPv4-embedded IPv6 destinations from native IPv6 ones.</t>
       <t>Maintaining a separate routing table for IPv4-embedded IPv6 routes 
        optimizes IPv4 packets forwarding. It also prevents overload of the 
        native IPv6 routing tables. A separate routing table can be generated
        from a separate routing instance or a separate routing topology.</t>
       </section>
      
      <section title="Routing Solution per RFC5565" toc="default">
       <t>The aforementioned scenario is described in <xref target="RFC5565" 
       pageno="false" format="default"></xref>, i.e., IPv4-over-IPv6 scenario, 
       where the network core is IPv6-only, and the inter-connected IPv4 networks 
       are called IPv4 client networks. The P Routers in the core only support
       IPv6 but the AFBRs (Address Family Border Routers) support IPv4 on
       interfaces facing IPv4 client networks, and IPv6 on interfaces facing
       the core. The routing solution defined in <xref target="RFC5565" pageno="false" 
       format="default"></xref> for this scenario is to run i-BGP among AFBRs
       to exchange IPv4 routing information in the core, and the IPv4
       packets are forwarded from one IPv4 client network to the other
       through a softwire using tunneling technology such as MPLS LSP, GRE,
       L2TPv3, etc.</t>
      </section>
  
      <section title="An Alternative Routing Solution with OSPFv3" toc="default">
        <t>In this document, we propose an alternative routing solution for
        the scenario described in <xref target="scenario" pageno="false" format="default">
        </xref>, where several segregated IPv4 networks, called IPv4 client networks, are
        inter-connected by an IPv6 network. The IPv6 network
and the inter-connected IPv4 networks may or may not
belong to the same 
        Autonomous System. We refer to
        the border node on the boundary of an IPv4 client network and the IPv6
        network as an Address Family Translation Border Router (AFXLBR), 
        which supports both the IPv4 and IPv6 address families, and is
        capable of translating an IPv4 packet to an IPv6 packet, and vice
        versa, according to <xref target="RFC6145" pageno="false" 
        format="default"></xref>. The described scenario is illustrated in Figure 1.</t>

        <t>Since the scenario occurs most commonly within an  
organization, an IPv6 
        prefix can be locally allocated and used by AFXLBRs to construct IPv4-embedded 
        IPv6 addresses according to <xref target="RFC6052" pageno="false" format="default">
        </xref>. The embedded IPv4 address or prefix belongs to an IPv4 client network 
        that is connected to the AFXLBR. An AFXLBR injects IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses 
        and prefixes into the IPv6 network using OSPFv3, and it also installs 
        IPv4-embedded IPv6 routes advertised by other AFXLBRs. </t>
        <t> When an AFXLBR receives an IPv4 packet from a locally connected 
        IPv4 client network and destined to a remote IPv4 client network, it 
        translates the IPv4 header to the relevant IPv6 header according to 
        <xref target="RFC6145" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>, and in that 
        process, source and destination IPv4 address are translated into IPv4-embedded 
        IPv6 addresses, respectively, according to <xref target="RFC6052" pageno="false" 
        format="default"></xref>. The resulting IPv6 packet is 
        then forwarded to the AFXLBR that connects to the destination IPv4 client 
        network. The remote AFXLBR derives the IPv4 source and destination addresses 
        from the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses, respectively, according to 
        <xref target="RFC6052" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>, and translates the 
        header of the received IPv6 packet to the relevant IPv4 header according 
        to <xref target="RFC6145" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>. The resulting 
        IPv4 packet is then forwarded 
        according to the IPv4 routing table maintained on the AFXLBR.</t>
        <t>There are use cases where the proposed routing solution is useful.
        One case is that some border nodes do not participate in i-BGP for
        routes exchange, or i-BGP is
        not used at all. Another case is when tunnels are not deployed in
        the IPv6 network, or native IPv6 forwarding is preferred. Note
        that with this routing solution, the IPv4 and IPv6 header translation 
        performed in both directions by the AFXLBR is stateless.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="OSPFv3 Routing with a Specific Topology" toc="default">
        <t>In general, IPv4-embedded IPv6 packets can be forwarded just like 
        native IPv6 packets with OSPFv3 running in the IPv6 network.  
        However, this would require IPv4-embedded IPv6 routes to be flooded 
        throughout the entire IPv6 network and stored on every router. This
        is not desirable from the scaling perspective. Moreover, since all IPv6 
        routes are stored in the same routing table, it would be inconvenient to manage 
        the resource required for routing and forwarding based on traffic category, 
        if so desired. </t>
        <t>To improve the situation, a separate OSPFv3 routing table can be
        constructed that is dedicated to the IPv4-embedded IPv6 topology, and
        that table is solely used for routing IPv4-embedded IPv6 packets
        in the IPv6 network. The IPv4-embedded IPv6 topology includes
        all the participating AFXLBR routers and a set of 
P(rovider) Routers providing
        redundant connectivity with alternate routing paths.</t>
        <t>There are two methods to build a separate OSPFv3 routing table for 
        IPv4-embedded IPv6 routes: <list style="symbols"><t>The first one is to run a 
        separate OSPFv3 instance for IPv4-embedded IPv6 topology in the IPv6 network according
        to <xref target="RFC5838" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>.</t>
        <t>The second one is to stay with the existing OSPFv3 instance
        that already operates in the IPv6 network, but maintain a separate 
        IPv4-embedded IPv6 topology, according to <xref target="I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3" 
        pageno="false" format="default"></xref>.</t></list></t>
        <t>With either method, there would be a dedicated IPv4-embedded IPv6
        topology that is maintained on all participating AFXLBR and P Routers,
        along with a dedicated IPv4-embedded IPv6 routing table. This routing
        table is then used solely in the IPv6 network for IPv4-embedded
        IPv6 packets.</t>
        <t>It would be an operator's preference as which method
        is to be used. This document elaborates on how configuration is
        done for each method and related routing issues that are common to
        both.</t>
        <t>This document only focuses on unicast routing for IPv4-embedded
        IPv6 packets using OSPFv3.</t>

        <t>Before deploying configurations that use a 
        separate OSPFv3 routing table for IPv4-embedded IPv6
        addresses and prefixes, a decision must be made on the set of routers and
        their interfaces in the IPv6 network that should be part of the
        IPv4-embedded IPv6 topology.</t>

        <t>For the purpose of this IPv4-embedded IPv6 topology, all AFXLBRs 
          that connect to IPv4 client networks MUST be members of this topology.
          An AFXLBR MUST have at least one connection with a P Router in the
          IPv6 network or another AFXLBR.</t>

        <t>The IPv4-embedded IPv6 topology is a sub-topology of the entire
        IPv6 network, and if all routers (including AFXLBRs and
        P-routers) and all their interfaces are included, the two topologies
        converge. Generally speaking, when this sub-topology contains more 
        inter-connected P Routers, there would be more routing paths across the 
        IPv6 network from one IPv4 client network to the other; however, this
        requires more routers in the IPv6 network to participate in 
        IPv4-embedded IPv6 routing. In any case, the IPv4-embedded IPv6 topology

        ingress AFXLBR, the source IPv4 address and destination IPv4 address
        are translated into the corresponding IPv6 source address and
        destination IPv6 address, respectively, and during translation from an
        IPv6 header to an IPv4 header at an egress AFXLBR, the source IPv6
        address and destination IPv6 address are translated into the
        corresponding IPv4 source address and destination IPv4 address,
        respectively. Note that the address translation is accomplished in a
        stateless manner.</t>

       <t>When a well-known IPv6 prefix (WKP) is used, [RFC6052] allows only 
       global IPv4 addresses to be embedded in the IPv6 address. An IPv6
       address composed with a WKP and a non-global IPv4 address is hence
       invalid, and packets that contain such address received by an AFXLBR 
       are dropped.</t>

       <t>In the case where both the IPv4 client networks and the IPv6 transit 
       network belong to the same organization, non-global IPv4 addresses may be 
       used with a network-specific prefix [RFC6052].</t>

      <section title="Advertising IPv4-embedded IPv6 Routes" toc="default">
      <t>In order to forward IPv4 packets to the proper destination across
      an IPv6 network, IPv4 reachability needs to be disseminated
      throughout the IPv6 network and this is performed by
      AFXLBRs that connect to IPv4 client networks using OSPFv3.</t>
      <t>With the scenario described in this document, i.e., a set of AFXLBRs
      that inter-connect a bunch of IPv4 client networks with an IPv6 
      network, the IPv4 networks and IPv6 networks belong to the same or separate Autonomous Systems, and as such, these AFXLBRs behave as 
      AS Boundary Routers (ASBRs).</t>
  
     <section title="Advertising IPv4-embedded IPv6 Routes through an IPv6 Transit Network" 
        toc="default" anchor="transit">
        <t>IPv4 addresses and prefixes in an IPv4 client network are
        translated into IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses and prefixes,
        respectively, using the IPv6 prefix allocated by the operator and the
        method specified in <xref target="RFC6052" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>. 
        These routes are then advertised by one or more attached ASBRs into the IPv6 
        transit network using AS-External-LSAs <xref target="RFC5340" pageno="false"

      <section title="Routing Metrics" toc="default">
      <t>By default, the metric in an AS-External-LSA that carries an
          IPv4-embedded IPv6 address or prefixes is a Type 1 external metric,
          which is comparable to the link state metric and we assume that in most
          cases, OSPFv2 is used in client IPv4 networks. This metric is added to 
          the metric of the intra-AS path to the ASBR during
          the OSPFv3 route calculation. Through ASBR configuration, the metric
          can be set to a Type 2 external metric, which is considered much
          larger than the metric for any intra-AS path. Refer to the
          OSPFv3 specification <xref target="RFC5340" pageno="false" format="default">
          </xref> for more detail. In either case,
          an external metric may take the same value as in an IPv4 network
          (using OSPFv2 or another routing protocol), but may also be specified 
          based on some routing policy; the details of which are outside of the

          <t>If the "Forwarding Address" field of an OSPFv3 AS-External-LSA is used

          where the embedded IPv4 address is the 
          destination address in an IPv4 client network. However, since an AFXLBR 
          sits on the border of an IPv4 network and an IPv6 network, it is 
          RECOMMENDED that the "Forwarding Address" field is not used, so that
          the AFXLBR can make the forwarding decision based on its own IPv4 
          routing table.</t>

      <section title="Advertising IPv4 Addresses into Client Networks" toc="default">
        <t>IPv4-embedded IPv6 routes injected into the IPv6 network from one IPv4 client 
        network MAY be advertised into another IPv4 client network, after the associated 
        destination addresses and prefixes are translated back to IPv4 addresses and prefixes, 
        respectively. This operation is similar to normal OSPFv3 
        operation, wherein an AS-External-LSA can be advertised in a non-backbone area by 
        default.</t>
        <t>An IPv4 client network can limit which advertisements it receives through

    <section anchor="Aggregation" title="Aggregation on IPv4 Addresses and Prefixes" toc="default">
      <t>In order to reduce the amount of LSAs that are injected to the IPv6
         network, an implementation should provide mechanisms to aggregate 
         IPv4 addresses and prefixes at AFXLBR prior to advertisement as 
         IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses and prefixes. In general, the aggregation
         practice should be based on routing policy, which is outside of the
         scope of this document.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Forwarding" toc="default">
      <t>There are three cases in forwarding IP packets in the scenario 
      described in this document:<list style="numbers"><t>On an AFXLBR, 
      if an IPv4 packet that is received on an interface
      connecting to an IPv4 client network with a destination IPv4
      address belonging to another IPv4 client network, the header of the
      packet is translated to the corresponding IPv6 header as described in
      <xref target="translation" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>, 
      and the packet is then forwarded to the destination AFXLBR that 
      advertised the IPv4-embedded IPv6
      address into the IPv6 network.</t><t>On an AFXLBR, if an IPv4-embedded 
      IPv6 packet is received and the embedded destination IPv4 address is 
      in its IPv4 routing table, the header of the packet is translated to 
      the corresponding IPv4 header as described in 
      <xref target="translation" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>, 
      and the packet is then forwarded accordingly.</t><t> On any router that 
      is within the IPv4-embedded IPv6 topology subset of the IPv6 network, 
      if an IPv4-embedded IPv6 packet is received and a route is found in the 
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 routing table, the packet is forwarded to the IPv6 
      next-hop just like the handling for a normal IPv6 packet, without any 
      translation.</t></list></t>
      <t>The classification of IPv4-embedded IPv6 packet is according to the
      IPv6 prefix of the destination address, which is either the Well Known
      Prefix (i.e., 64:ff9b::/96) or locally allocated as defined in <xref 
      target="RFC6052" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>.</t>
    </section>
 
     <section title="Backdoor Connections" toc="default">
     <t>In some deployments, IPv4 client networks are inter-connected across
     the IPv6 network, but also directly connected to each other. The
     direct connections between IPv4 client networks, as sometimes called
     "backdoor" connections, can certainly be used to transport IPv4
     packets between IPv4 client networks. In general, backdoor connections
     are preferred over the IPv6 network since there requires no address
     family translation.</t>

     </section>

    <section title="Prevention of Loops" toc="default">
      <t>If an LSA sent from an AFXLBR into a client network could then be received 
      by another AFXLBR, it would be possible for routing loops to occur.  To prevent 
      loops, an AFXLBR MUST set the DN-bit <xref target="RFC4576" pageno="false" 
      format="default"></xref> in any LSA that it sends to a client network.  
      The AFXLBR MUST also ignore any LSA received from a client network that already 
      has the DN-bit sent.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="MTU Issues" toc="default">
      <t>In the IPv6 network, there are no new MTU issues introduced by
      this document. If a separate OSPFv3 instance (per <xref target="RFC5838" 
      pageno="false" format="default"></xref>) is used for IPv4-embedded IPv6 routing, 
      the MTU handling in the IPv6 network is the same as that of the default
      OSPFv3 instance. If a separate OSPFv3 topology (according to <xref target=
      "I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>)
      is used for IPv4-embedded IPv6 routing, the MTU handling in the IPv6 network is 
      the same as that of the default OSPFv3 topology.</t>
      <t>However, the MTU in the IPv6 network may be different than
      that of IPv4 client networks. Since an IPv6 router will never fragment a
      packet, the packet size of any IPv4-embedded IPv6 packet entering the
      IPv6 network must be equal to or less than the MTU of the
      IPv6 network. In order to achieve this requirement, it is
      recommended that AFXLBRs perform IPv6 path discovery among themselves
      and the resulting MTU, after taking into account of the difference
      between the IPv4 header length and the IPv6 header length, must be
      "propagated" into IPv4 client networks, e.g., included in
      the OSPFv2 Database Description packet.</t>
      <t>The details of passing the proper MTU into IPv4 client networks are
      beyond the scope of this document.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations" toc="default">

      <t>There are several security aspects that require attention in the 
      deployment practice described in this document.</t>

      <t>In the OSPFv3 transit network, the security considerations for OSPFv3 
      are covered in <xref target="RFC5340" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>, 
      and in particular, IPsec can be used for OSPFv3 authentication and 
      confidentiality as suggested in 
      <xref target="RFC5838" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>.</t>   
  
      <t>When a separate OSPFv3 instance is used to support IPv4-embedded IPv6 
      routing, the same Security Association (SA) (refer to 
      <xref target="RFC4552" pageno="false" format="default"></xref> ) must be 
      used by the embedded IPv4 address instance as other instances utilizing 
      the same link as specified in 
      <xref target="RFC5838" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>.</t>    

      <t>Security considerations as currently documented in
      <xref target="RFC6052" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>  must also 
      be thought through with proper implementation 
      including the following:<list style="symbols">

      <t>The IPv6 prefix that is used to carry an embedded IPv4 address 
      (refer to <xref target="AddrTran" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>) 

      must be configured by the authorized operator on 
      all participating AFXLBRs in a secure manner. This is to help prevent an 
      malicious attack resulting in network disruption, denial of service, and 
      possible information disclosure.</t>

      <t>Effective mechanisms (such as reverse path checking) must be implemented 
      in the IPv6 transit network (including AFXLIBR nodes) to prevent spoofing 
      on embedded IPv4 addresses, which, otherwise, might be used as source 
      addresses of malicious packets.</t>

      <t>If firewalls are used in IPv4 and/or IPv6 networks, the configuration 
      on the routers must be consistent so there are no holes in the IPv4 address 
      filtering.</t></list></t>  
   
      <t>The details of security handling are beyond the scope of this document.</t>       
     </section>

<section title="Operational Considerations" toc="default">

<t>This document put together some mechanisms based on existing technologies developed by IETF as an integrated solution to transport IPv4 packets over an IPv6 network using a separate OSPFv3 routing table. There are several aspects that require attention for the deployment and operation.</t>

<t>The tunnel-based solution documented in 
<xref target="RFC5565" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>
and the solution proposed in this document are both used for transporting IPv4 packets over an IPv6 network, with different mechanisms. The two methods are not related to each other, and they can co-exist in the same network if so deployed, without any conflict. </t>

<t> If one approach is to be deployed, it is the operator's
decision for the choice. Note that each approach has its own
characteristics and requirements. E.g., the tunnel-based
solution requries a mesh of inter-AFBR softwires (tunnels) 
spanning the IPv6 network, as well as iBGP to exchange routes
between AFBRs 
(<xref target="RFC5565" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>); the approach in this document requires
AFXLBR capable of perfoming IPv4-IPv6 packet header translation
per <xref target="RFC6145" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>.</t>

<t>To deploy the solution as documented here, there requires some configurations. An IPv6 prefix must first be chosen that is used to form all the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses and prefixes advertised by AFXLBR in the IPv6 network; the detail is referred to <xref target="AddrTran" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>.  
If the IPv4-embedded IPv6 routing table is created by using a separate OSPFv3 instance in the IPv6 network, configuration is accomplished according to 
<xref target="RFC5838" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>,
as described in 
<xref target="Instance" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>, 
and if the default OSPFv3 instance is used instead, configuration is accomplished according to 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3" 
        pageno="false" format="default"></xref>, 
as described in <xref target="MTopology" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>.</t>

<t>With the solution as described in this document, IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses and prefixes will be injected by AFXLBR into some part of the IPv6 network (see 
<xref target="TheTopo" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>
for details), and a separate routing table will be used for IPv4-embedded IPv6 routing. Care must be taken during the network design, such that 1) aggregation are performed on IPv4 addresses and prefixes before being advertised in the IPv6 network as described in 
<xref target="Aggregation" pageno="false" format="default"></xref>,
and 2) estimates are made as the amount of IPv4-embedded IPv6 routes that would be disseminated in the IPv6 network, and the size of the separate OSPFv3 routing table. Note this document does not change any behavior of OSPFv3, and the existing or common practice should apply.</t>
