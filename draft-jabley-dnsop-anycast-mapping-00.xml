    <abstract>
      <t>Anycast is a deployment technique commonly employed for
	authoritative-only servers in the Domain Name System (DNS).
	L-Root, one of the thirteen root servers, is deployed in
	this fashion.</t>

      <t>Various techniques have been used to map deployed anycast
	infrastructure externally, i.e. without reference to inside
	knowledge about where and how such infrastructure has been
	deployed. Motivations for performing such measurement
	exercises include operational troubleshooting and infrastructure
	risk assessment. In the specific case of L-Root, the ability
	to measure and map anycast infrastructure using the techniques
	mentioned in this document is provided for reasons of
	operational transparency.</t>

      <t>This document describes all facilities deployed at L-Root
	to facilitate mapping of its infrastructure and serves as
	documentation for L-Root as a measurable service.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in <xref
	target="RFC1034"/> and <xref target="RFC1035"/>. L-Root,
	one of the thirteen root servers, is deployed using <xref
	target="RFC4786">anycast</xref>; its service addresses,
	published in the A and AAAA Resource Record (RR) Sets for
	"L.ROOT-SERVERS.NET", are made available from a substantial
	number of semi-autonomous servers deployed throughout the
	Internet. A list of locations served by L-Root can be found
	at <eref target="http://www.root-servers.org"/>.</t>

      <t><xref target="Fan2013"/> describes a technique using open
	DNS resolvers to distribute mapping queries to the service
	addresses of authoritative-only servers. This technique
	relies upon the ability to acquire meaningful information
	about individual anycast nodes by means of an IN-class
	query. At the time the experiments described in that paper
	were conducted, such ability existed with <xref
	target="RFC6304">AS112 servers</xref> but not with any
	root server. Modifications were subsequently made to the
	infrastructure of the L-Root service to facilitate this
	technique.</t>

      <t>This document describes all facilities currently provided
        at L-Root to aid node identification.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Naming Scheme for L-Root Nodes">
      <t>Individual L-Root nodes have structured hostnames that
        are constructed as follows:

      <list style="empty">
        <t>&lt;IATA Code&gt;&lt;NN&gt;.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG</t>
      </list>

      where

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>&lt;IATA Code&gt; is chosen from the list of three-character 
	  airport codes published by the International Air Transport
	  Association (IATA) in the <eref
	  target="http://www.iata.org/publications/Pages/coding.aspx">IATA
	  Airline Coding Directory</eref>; and</t>

        <t>&lt;NN&gt; is a two-digit numeric code used to distinguish
          between two different locations in the vicinity of the same
          airport.</t>
      </list>

      Where multiple airports exist in the vicinity of a single
      L-Root node, one is arbitrarily chosen.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Identification of L-Root Nodes">
      <t>L-Root service is provided using a single IPv4 address
	(199.7.83.42) and a single IPv6 address (2001:500:3::42).
	It should be noted that it is preferable to refer to the
	service using its DNS name (L.ROOT-SERVERS.NET) rather than
	literal addresses, since addresses can change from time to
	time.</t>

      <t>At the time of writing there are 273 separate name server
	elements ("nodes") deployed in 143 locations which together
	provide L-Root service. A DNS query sent to an L-Root service
	address will be routed towards exactly one of those nodes
        for processing, and the corresponding DNS response will
        be originated from the same node. Queries from different
        clients may be routed to different nodes.</t>

      <t>The following sections provide a summary of all mechanisms
        provided by L-Root to allow a client to identify which L-Root
        node is being used.</t>

      <section title="Use of NSID">
        <t>L-Root supports the use of the <xref target="RFC5001">Name
          Server Identifier (NSID) Option</xref> to return the identity
          of an L-Root node along with the response to a DNS query.
          The NSID payload of such responses is the fully-qualified
          hostname of the responding L-Root node.</t>

        <t>The NSID option can be specified using the widely-used
          diagnostic tool "dig" using the "+nsid" option, as shown
          below. Note that long lines have been truncated for the
          purposes of this document ("\" at the end of a line
          indicates continuation).</t>

      <section title="Use of IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT and IN/A">
	<t>The operator of L-Root has distributed a separate DNS
	  service in parallel with L-Root, operating on precisely
	  the same set of nodes. Measurements of this separate
	  service should give results which are representative of
	  L-Root. Further discussion of this service can be found
          in <xref target="identity"/>.</t>

        <t>The fully-qualified DNS name IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG
          (note the use of ORG, not NET) has associated TXT and A
          RR Sets which are unique to the responding node. Clients
          are hence able to issue queries for
          IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/A and
          IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT and use the results both
          to identify individual nodes and to distinguish between
          responses generated by different nodes.</t>

        <t>The TXT record returned in the response to such queries
          is structured as follows:

          <list style="numbers">

            <t>The ICANN region in which the node is located.</t>

      <section title="Use of NODES.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT">
        <t>The fully-qualified DNS name NODES.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG
          (note again the use of ORG, not NET) provides multiple
          TXT RRs, one per node, and represents the effective
          concatenation of all possible responses to the query
          IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT.</t>

        <t>Since the identity data is published using IN-class
          resource records, it is not necessary to send queries
          directly towards L-Root in order to obtain results.
          Responses can be obtained through recursive servers, the
          responses in those cases being the identity of L-Root
          as observed through the recursive server used rather than
          the "closest" L-Root node to the client.</t>

        <t>Note that in the example below we have forced dig to
	  send the query over TCP, since we expect the response to
	  be too large for UDP transport to accommodate. Note also
	  that the list shown is truncated for clarity, and can be
	  expected to change from time to time as new L-Root nodes
	  are provisioned and old ones decommissioned.</t>

    <section title="Provisioning of IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG"
      anchor="identity">
      <t>Individual L-Root nodes run a dedicated, separate
        authority-only DNS server process which serves the
        IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG zone. The contents of that
        zone are unique to every node, and hence each responding
        node will generate a node-specific response.</t>

     <t>The contents of the IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG zone are
        hence deliberately incoherent, the apparent zone contents
        depending on the ndoe responding to the corresponding
        query.</t>

      <t>The IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG zone is delegated to the
        single name server BEACON.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG, numbered
        on IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that are covered by the same
        routing advertisements that cover the L-Root service
        addresses. Reachability of BEACON.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG
        is hence well-aligned with the reachability of
        L.ROOT-SERVERS.NET, and hence measurement of the IDENTITY
        service ought to give similar results to measurement of
        the L-Root service.</t>

      <t>It is considered best practice always to delegate a
	DNS zone to more than one name server; however, as described,
	the IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG zone is delegated to just
	one server. Ordinarily this would present a risk of failure
	if that single server is not available; however, given the
	purpose of the delegation in this case and that the expected
	mitigation of a failure in a single node is the routing of
	a query to a different node, delegation to a single server
	in this particular use-case is effective.</t>
