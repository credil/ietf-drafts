Abstract

   This document describes practices for the deployment of existing
   mobility protocols in a distributed mobility management environment,
   and identifies the limitations in the current practices with respect
   to providing the expected functionality.

   The practices and gap analysis is performed for IP-based mobility
   protocols, dividing them into two main solution families: client- and
   network-based.

Internet-Draft              DMM Gap Analysis                   July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) approach aims at setting up
   IP networks so that traffic is distributed in an optimal way and does
   not rely on centrally deployed anchors to manage IP mobility
   sessions.

   A first step towards the definition of DMM solutions is the
   definition of the problem of distributed mobility management and the
   identification of the main requirements for a distributed mobility
   management solution [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements], which are summarized
   below:

   o  REQ1: Distributed deployment.  IP mobility, network access and
      routing solutions provided by DMM must enable a distributed
      deployment of mobility management of IP sessions so that the
      traffic can be routed in an optimal manner without traversing
      centrally deployed mobility anchors.

   o  REQ2: Transparency to Upper Layers when needed.  The DMM solutions
      must provide transparency above the IP layer when needed.  Such
      transparency is needed, when the mobile hosts or entire mobile
      networks change their point of attachment to the Internet, for the
      application flows that cannot cope with a change of IP address.
      Otherwise the support to maintain a stable home IP address or
      prefix during handover may be declined.

   o  REQ3: IPv6 deployment.  The DMM solutions should target IPv6 as
      primary deployment and should not be tailored specifically to
      support IPv4, in particular in situations where private IPv4
      addresses and/or NATs are used.

   o  REQ4: Compatibility.  The DMM solution should be able to work
      between trusted administrative domains when allowed by the
      security measures deployed between these domains.  Furthermore,
      the DMM solution must be able to co-exist with existing network
      deployment and end hosts so that the existing deployment can
      continue to be supported.  For example, depending on the
      environment in which DMM is deployed, the DMM solutions may need
      to be compatible with other existing mobility protocols that are
      deployed in that environment or may need to be interoperable with
      the network or the mobile hosts/routers that do not support the
      DMM enabling protocol.

   o  REQ5: Existing mobility protocols.  A DMM solution should first
      consider reusing and extending the existing mobility protocols
      before specifying new protocols.

Internet-Draft              DMM Gap Analysis                   July 2012


   o  REQ6: Security considerations.  The protocol solutions for DMM
      must consider security, for example authentication and
      authorization mechanisms that allow a legitimate mobile host/
      router to access to the DMM service, protection of signaling
      messages of the protocol solutions in terms of authentication,
      data integrity, and data confidentiality, opti-in or opt-out data
      confidentiality to signaling messages depending on network
      environments or user requirements.

   We next first analyze existing practices of deployment of IP mobility
   solutions in a DMM environment [I-D.perkins-dmm-matrix],
   [I-D.patil-dmm-issues-and-approaches2dmm].  After that, a gap
   analysis is conducted, identifying what can be achieved with existing
   solutions and what is missing in order to meet the DMM requirements
   identified in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].


2.  Practices: deployment of existing solutions in a DMM environment

   This section documents practices for the deployment of existing
   mobility protocols in a distributed mobility management (DMM)
   environment.  This analysis is limited in scope to existing IPv6-
   based mobility protocols, such as Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275], NEMO Basic
   Support Protocol [RFC3963], Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213], and their
   extensions, such as Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 [RFC5380], Mobile IPv6
   Fast Handovers [RFC5568] or Localized Routing for Proxy Mobile IPv6
   [I-D.ietf-netext-pmip-lr], among others.

   The section is divided in two parts: client-based and network-based
   mobility.

2.1.  Client-based mobility

   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [RFC6275] and its extension to support mobile
   networks, the NEMO Basic Support protocol (NEMO B.S.) [RFC3963] are
   the main client-based IP mobility protocols.  They heavily rely on
   the figure of the Home Agent (HA), a centralized anchor, to provide
   mobile nodes (hosts and routers) with mobility support.  We next
   describe how Mobile IPv6/NEMO and several additional protocol
   extensions can be deployed to meet some of the DMM requirements
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

        Figure 1: Distributed operation of Mobile IPv6 / NEMO B.S.

   Due to the heavy dependance on the home agent role, Mobile IPv6 and
   NEMO B.S. plain vanilla protocols (i.e., without additional
   extensions) cannot be easily deployed in a distributed fashion.  One
   approach would be to deploy several HAs (like in Figure 1, and assign
   to each MN the one closest to its topological location [RFC4640],
   [RFC5026], [RFC6611].  In the example shown in Figure 1, MN1 is
   assigned HA1 (and a home address anchored by HA1), while MN2 is
   assigned HA2.  Note that current Mobile IPv6 / NEMO B.S.
   specifications do not allow the use of multiple home agents by a
   mobile node simultaneously, and therefore the benefits of this
   deployment model shown here are limited.  For example, if MN1 moves
   and attaches to AR4, the path followed by data packets would be
   suboptimal, as they have to traverse HA1, which is no longer close to
   the topological attachment point of MN1.

                 Figure 2: Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization

   One of the main goals of DMM is to avoid the suboptimal routing
   caused by centralized anchoring.  By default, Mobile IPv6 (and NEMO
   B.S.) uses the so-called Bidirectional Tunnel (BT) mode, in which
   data traffic is always encapsulated between the MN and its HA.
   Mobile IPv6 also specifies the Route Optimization (RO) mode, which
   allows the MN to update its current location on the CNs, and then use
   the direct path between them An example is shown in Figure 2, in
   which MN1 is using BT mode with CN2 and RO mode with CN1.  Note that
   this RO mode has several drawbacks:

   o  The RO mode is only supported by Mobile IPv6.  There is no route
      optimization support standardized for the NEMO B. S. protocol,
      although there are many different solution proposed, mainly as
      academic exercises.

   o  The RO mode requires additional signaling, which adds some
      protocol overhead.

   o  The signaling required to enable RO involves the home agent, and
      it is repeated periodically because of security reasons [RFC4225].
      This basically means that the HA remains as single point of
      failure, because the Mobile IPv6 RO mode does not mean HA-less
      operation.

   o  The RO mode requires additional support on the correspondent node
      (CN).

                 Figure 3: Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization

   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) [RFC5380] allows reducing the
   amount of mobility signaling as well as the overall handover
   performance of Mobile IPv6, by introducing a new hierarchy level to
   handle local mobility.  The Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) entity is
   introduced as a local mobility handling node deployed closer to the
   mobile node.

   When HMIPv6 is used, the MN two different temporal addresses: the
   Regional Care-of Address (RCoA) and the Local Care-of Address (LCoA).

Internet-Draft              DMM Gap Analysis                   July 2012


   The RCoA is anchored at one MAP, that plays the role of local home
   agent, while the LCoA is anchored at the access router level.  The
   mobile node used the RCoA as the CoA signaled to its home agent.
   Therefore, while roaming within a local domain handled by the same
   MAP, the mobile node does not need to update its home agent (i.e.,
   the mobile node does not change RCoA).

   The use of HMIPv6 allows some certain route optimization, as a mobile
   node may decide to directly use the RCoA as source address for a
   communication with a given correspondent node, if the MN does not
   expect to move outside the local domain during the lifetime of the
   communication.  This can be seen as a potential DMM mode of
   operation.  In the example shown in Figure 3, MN1 is using its global
   HoA to communicate with CN1, while it is using its RCoA to
   communicate with CN2.

   Additionally, a local domain might have several MAPs deployed,
   enabling different kind of HMIPv6 deployments (e.g., flat and
   distributed).  HMIPv6 specification supports a flexible selection of
   the MAP (e.g., based on the distance between the MN and the MAP,
   taking into consideration the expected mobility pattern of the MN,
   etc.).

2.1.4.  Home Agent switch

   The Home Agent switch specification [RFC5142] defines a new mobility
   header for signaling a mobile node that it should acquire a new home
   agent.  Although the purposes of this specification do not include
   the case of changing the mobile node's home address, as that might
   imply loss of connectivity for ongoing connections, it could be used
   to force the change of home agent in those situations where there are
   no active sessions running that cannot cope themselves with a change
   of home address.

2.1.5.  Flow Mobility

   There exist different protocols meant to support flow mobility with
   Mobile IPv6, namely the multiple care-of address registration
   [RFC5648], the flow bindings in Mobile IPv6 and NEMO B.S. [RFC6089]
   and the traffic selectors for flow bindings [RFC6088].  The use of
   these extensions allows a mobile node to associate different flows
   with different care-of addresses that the mobile owns at a given
   time.  This could also be used, combined with the route optimization
   support, to improve the paths followed by data packets.

2.1.6.  Source Address selection API

   The IPv6 socket API for source address selection [RFC5014], [RFC3484]
   can be used by an application running on a mobile node to express its
   preference of using a home address or a care-of address in a given
   connection.  This allows, for example, that an application which can
   survive an IP address change to always prefer the use of a care-of
   address.  Similarly, and as mentioned in [RFC6275], a mobile node can
   also prefer the use of a care-of address for sessions that are going
   to finish before the mobile node hands off to a different attachment
   point (e.g., short-lived connections like DNS dialogs).

2.2.  Network-based mobility

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] and GPRS Tunneling Protocol
   (GTP) [3GPP.29.060] are the main network-based IP mobility protocols.
   PMIPv6 relies on the figure of the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) to
   provide mobile nodes with mobility support, without requiring the
   involvement of the mobile nodes, and supplying the required
   functionality by the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG).  We next describe
   how PMIPv6 and several additional protocol extensions can be deployed
   to meet some of the DMM requirements [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

           Figure 4: Distributed operation of Proxy Mobile IPv6

   As with Mobile IPv6, plain Proxy Mobile IPv6 operation cannot be
   easily decentralized.  One simple, but still suboptimal, approach
   would be to deploy several local mobility anchors and use a
   topological position based assignment to attaching mobile nodes (an
   example is shown in Figure 4.  This assignment can be static or
   dynamic (as described in Section 2.2.3.  The main advantage of this
   simple approach is that the IP address anchor (i.e., the LMA) is
   placed close to the mobile node, and therefore resulting paths are
   close-to-optimal.  On the other hand, as soon as the mobile node
   moves, the resulting path starts to deviate from the optimal one,
   unless an inter-LMA mobility protocol is in place (which is missing
   today).

2.2.2.  Local Routing

   [I-D.ietf-netext-pmip-lr] enables optimal routing in Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 in three cases: two MNs attached to the same MAG and LMA, two
   MNs attached to different MAGs but same LMA and two MNs attached to
   the same MAG with different LMAs.  In these three cases, data traffic
   between two mobile nodes does not traverse the LMA(s), thus providing
   some form of distribution, since the traffic is locally router at the
   edge.

   The main disadvantage of this approach is that it only tackles the
   MN-to-MN communication scenario, and only under certain
   circumstances.

   In the context of 3GPP the closest analogy is the use of the X2
   interface between two eNBs to directly exchange data traffic during
   handover procedures. 3GPP does not foresee the use of local routing
   at any other point of the network given the structure of the EPS
   bearer model.

2.2.3.  LMA runtime assignment

   [RFC6463] specifies a runtime local mobility anchor assignment
   functionality and corresponding mobility options for Proxy Mobile
   IPv6.  This runtime local mobility anchor assignment takes place
   during a Proxy Binding Update and a Proxy Binding Acknowledgment
   message exchange between a mobile access gateway and a local mobility
   anchor.  While this mechanism mainly aims for load-balancing
   purposes, it can also be used to select an optimal LMA from a point
   of view of routing.  If properly complemented by an inter-LMA
   mobility protocol, it could also be used as part of a global DMM
   solution.  Even without that solution, a runtime LMA assignment can
   be used to change the assigned LMA of an MN, for example when no
   session is alive (or when those running can survive an IP address
   change).

   In the context of 3GPP network similar considerations have been
   discussed with respect to SIPTO above the RAN or at the macro.  When
   a MN is allowed to get SIPTO service a geographically close P-GW is
   selected during connection time.  That is, upon establishment of the
   PDN connection, the MN is configured with an IP address belonging to
   an optimal P-GW from a routing point of view.  The drawback is that
   if the MN moves out of the region covered by that P-GW it will need
   to disconnect from the network and reconnect again since no seamless
   session continuity is provided.  In this sense applications that do
   not survive and IP address change will result in an unpredictable
   behavior.

2.2.4.  Source Address Selection

   Also in the context of network based mobility source address
   selection API can be considered as a mean to achieve better routing
   (or using different anchors) and similar considerations of section
   2.1.6 apply here.  For instance a MN connected to a PMIPv6 domain
   could attach two different wireless network interfaces to two
   different MAGs, hence configuring a different set of HNPs on both
   interfaces (potentially combining both IPv4 and IPv6).  Based on
   application requirements or operator's policies the connection
   manager logic could instruct the IP stack on the MN to route selected
   traffic on a specific wireless interface.  It should be noted that
   source address selection mostly provides a better routing but not
   session continuity in case a session should be anchored and a
   different LMA.

   In the context of 3GPP networks two ongoing study items are currently
   addressing the issue of selecting a wireless interface or an IP
   address for a specific application.  The study item DIDA (Data
   IDentification in ANDSF) is addressing the need to map an application
   ID to a specific wireless interface, while the study item OPIIS
   (Operator Policies for IP Interface Selection) is addressing the need
   of selecting the right APN for a given application.  Taking into
   account that there is a one to one link between APN and PDN
   connection (IP address) the second study item clearly addresses from
   a 3GPP perspective the same problem space as RFC 3484.

2.2.5.  Multihoming in PMIPv6 (as per RFC 5213)

   PMIPv6 provides some multihoming support.  RFC 5213 defines that the
   LMA can maintain one mobility session per attached interface and that
   upon handover the full set of HNPs can be moved to another interface
   in case of inter-technology handover (MAGs providing different
   wireless access technology) or maintained on the same interface in
   case of intra-technology handover (MAGs providing the same wireless
   access technology).  A MN can also attach (as described in section
   2.2.4) two different interfaces to the PMIPv6 domain, hence resulting
   in a multihomed device being able to send/receive traffic
   sequentially or simultaneously from both network interfaces.  [REF to
   flow mob draft] extends the base RFC5213 capabilities in the sense
   that a mobility session can now be shared across two different access
   networks.  It derives that a selected flow could be routed through
   different paths hence achieving some sort of better routing.  Yet all
   the traffic is anchored to centralized anchor points.

   In the context of 3GPP networks the MAPCON feature addresses the use
   of multiple PDN connections, hence the use of multiple wireless
   interfaces either sequentially or simultaneously.

3.  Gap Analysis: limitations in current practices

   This section identifies the limitations in the current practices
   (documented in Section 2) with respect to the requirements listed in
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

   The section is also divided in two parts: client-based and network-
   based mobility.  Each section analyzes how well the requirements
   listed in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements] are covered/met by the current
   practices, highlighting existing limitations and gaps.

   The remaining of this section will be provided in a future version of
   this document.

3.1.  Client-based mobility

3.1.1.  REQ1: Distributed deployment

   MIPv6 / NEMO B. S.  A careful home agent deployment and policy
      configuration of the Mobile IPv6 / NEMO B.S. protocols can achieve
      some distribution.  However, as soon as the mobile node moves and
      changes its initial attachment point, the anchors are no longer
      placed optimally, incurring in sub-optimal routes.  If the mobile
      node is not expected to move within a limited area, this
      configuration might be considered sufficient.  Otherwise,
      additional mechanisms to support dynamic anchoring would be
      needed.

   Mobile IPv6 RO  The use of route optimization support enables a
      close-to anchor-less operation, which effectively can be
      considered as a fully distributed configuration.  However, as
      explained before in this document, the home agent is still used
      for the signaling and therefore remains as a critical centralized
      component.  Additionally, there is no RO support for network
      mobility standardized.

   HMIPv6  The use of hierarchical mobile IPv6 can be seen as a step
      forward compared to a careful deployment of multiple home agents
      and its proper configuration, as it allows a mobile node to roam
      within a local domain, reducing the handover latency as well as
      the signaling overhead.  If used together with mobile IPv6,
      traffic still has to traverse the centralized home agent, and
      therefore no distributed operation is achieved.

   HA switch  The home agent switch specification can be used to enable
      obtaining more benefits from a multiple-HA deployment, as the
      mobile node could be instructed to switch to a closer home agent.
      This switch can only performed without packet connectivity loss,

      if done at periods of time in which the mobile node does not have
      any active connection running, and therefore the change of home
      address would require sessions reestablishment.

   Flow mobility  Previous considerations could also apply here, being
      the scenario extended by the use of multiple attached interfaces.

   SA selection API  The use of proper source address selection
      decisions, enabled by smart connection managers, or mobility aware
      applications using a selection API, would allow to benefit the
      most from deployments exhibiting multiple anchors.

3.1.2.  REQ2: Transparency to Upper Layers when needed

   MIPv6 / NEMO B. S.  As a mobility protocol is used, the solution is
      transparent to the upper layers.  However, as described before,
      this transparency comes with the cost of suboptimal routes if the
      mobile nodes moves away from its initial attachment point.

   Mobile IPv6 RO  The use of the route optimization support is
      transparent to the upper layers.

   HMIPv6  The use of HMIPv6 is transparent to the upper layers.

   HA switch  The use of the home agent switch functionality is not
      transparent to the upper layers, as a change of home agent
      normally implies a change of home address.  Therefore, it is only
      recommended to switch home agent when there is no active session
      running on the mobile node.

   Flow mobility  The use of flow mobility mechanisms is transparent to
      the upper layers.

   SA selection API  The use of an intelligent source address mechanisms
      is transparent to the upper layers if performed by the connection
      manager.  However if the selection is performed by the
      applications themselves, via the use of the API, then applications
      have to be mobility-aware.

3.1.3.  REQ3: IPv6 deployment

   MIPv6 / NEMO B. S.  Mobile IPv6 / NEMO B.S. protocols primarily
      support IPv6, although there are some extensions defined to also
      offer some IPv4 support.

   Mobile IPv6 RO  Route optimization only supports IPv6.

   HMIPv6  HMIPv6 is only defined for IPv6.

   HA switch  The home agent switch specification supports only IPv6,
      although the use of the defined mechanisms to support dual stack
      IPv4/IPv6 mobile nodes would also enable some IPv4 support in this
      case.

   Flow mobility  Flow mobility is only defined for IPv6.

   SA selection API  The use of source address selection mechanisms
      support both IPv6 and IPv4.

3.1.4.  REQ4: Compatibility

   MIPv6 / NEMO B. S.  This approach would be compatible with other
      protocols and work between trusted administrative domains,
      although as described before its operation would not provide the
      benefits of a fully distributed mechanism.

   Mobile IPv6 RO  This approach would be compatible with other
      protocols and work between trusted administrative domains, as long
      as mobile IPv6 is allowed.  However, as highlighted before, mobile
      IPv6 route optimization requires specific support on the
      correspondent nodes.

   HMIPv6  HMIPv6 is compatible with other protocols.

   HA switch  This approach would be compatible with other protocols and
      work between trusted administrative domains.

   Flow mobility  This approach would be compatible with other protocols
      and work between trusted administrative domains.

   SA selection API  This approach has no impact in terms of
      compatibility or use between trusted administrative domains.

3.1.5.  REQ5: Existing mobility protocols

   MIPv6 / NEMO B. S.  This approach is based on existing protocols
      [RFC6275] and [RFC3963].

3.1.6.  REQ6: Security considerations

   MIPv6 / NEMO B. S.  This approach include security considerations.

   Mobile IPv6 RO  This approach include security considerations.

   HMIPv6  This approach include security considerations.

   HA switch  This approach include security considerations.

   Flow mobility  This approach include security considerations.

   SA selection API  This approach does not have security issues.

3.2.  Network-based mobility

3.2.1.  REQ1: Distributed deployment

   Local Routing  As mentioned it enables optimal routing in three
      cases: the LMA manages the traffic of two mobile nodes connected
      to teh same MAG, the LMA manages the traffic of two mobile nodes
      connected to different MAGs, the MAG manages the traffic of two
      mobile nodes connected to different LMAs.  LR does not consider
      the case where the traffic should be optimized considering
      different MAGs and different LMAs.  Inter LMA communication is not
      in scope.  LR only enables better routing and does not consider
      the distribution of mobility anchors as such.

   LMA Runtime Assignment  The LMA runtime assignment is used to
      allocate an optimal LMA mostly for load balancing purposes (for
      instance in scenarios where LMAs run in datacenter alike
      infrastructure).  It can be used to allocate a different LMA based
      on other policies such as routing although is not clear how the
      technology can be used to achieve distributed mobility management,
      especially considering scalability issues.

   Source Address Selection  It can help in selecting a given IP source
      address although the specs have many limitations (for instance
      prefer IPv6 over IPv4, prefer HoA instead of CoA) and the socket
      extensions [RFC5014] require changes in the node.  This solution
      alone is not sufficient to achieve anchors distribution in case of
      session continuity requirements.

   Multihoming in PMIPv6  As summarized in the previous section a single
      mobility session belongs to a single LMA (at the most the same
      mobility session is shared across two access networks).  As of
      today there is no possibility to distribute anchors and to move
      the session between different LMAs.

3.2.2.  REQ2: Transparency to Upper Layers when needed

   Local Routing  During HO the standard mechanisms are used.  In this
      sense if there is a MAG change while LR is enabled signaling is
      exchanged to inform the target MAG that upon handover LR should be
      re-established.  The inter LMA case is not supported.  For this
      solution the mobility context is always up, all the traffic
      receive seamless service.

   LMA Runtime Assignment  Seamless support is provided as per RFC 5213.
      For this solution the mobility context is always up, all the
      traffic receive seamless service.

   Source Address Selection  No seamless support is provided since it
      requires solutions such as IP flow mobility for PMIPv6.

   Multihoming in PMIPv6  Seamless support falls back to standard PMIPv6
      operations extended for IP flow mobility support.  For this
      solution the mobility context is always up, all the traffic
      receive seamless service.

3.2.3.  REQ3: IPv6 deployment

   Local Routing  It supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

   LMA Runtime Assignment  It supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

   Source Address Selection  It supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

   Multihoming in PMIPv6  It supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

3.2.4.  REQ4: Compatibility

   Local Routing  Since it extends RFC 5213 compatibility with previous
      technology is provided.

   LMA Runtime Assignment  Since it extends RFC 5213 compatibility with
      previous technology is provided.

   Source Address Selection  To enable the full set of use cases
      mentioned above extensions are required thus impacting the
      landscape of mobile devices.  The extensions should not impact the
      network.

   Multihoming in PMIPv6  Since it extends RFC 5213 compatibility is
      provided.

3.2.5.  REQ5: Existing mobility protocols

   Local Routing  It reuses RFC 5213.

   LMA Runtime Assignment  It reuses RFC 5213.

   Source Address Selection  This is terminal only.

   Multihoming in PMIPv6  It reuses RFC 5213.

3.2.6.  REQ6: Security considerations

   Local Routing  It reuses RFC 5213 as such same security
      considerations apply.

   LMA Runtime Assignment  It reuses RFC 5213 as such same security
      considerations apply.

   Source Address Selection  There is not signaling involved here.

   Multihoming in PMIPv6  It reuses RFC 5213 as such same security
      considerations apply.


4.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA considerations.


5.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
