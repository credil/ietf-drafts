Internet-Draft      DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options for GRE       October 2012


1.  Introduction

   There are scenarios where the point-to-point access link types are
   required to be supported.  For example, Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213]
   supports only point-to-point access link types which assumes that the
   mobile node and mobile access gateway are the only two nodes on the
   access link.  In this case, both IP layer and layer-2 point-to-point
   can be used for this requirement.  When there is IP routed node being
   deployed between the two point-to-point nodes, only IP layer point-
   to-point mode can be used.  In this case, Generic Routing
   Encapsulation (GRE) [RFC2784] is one of ideal IP layer modes which
   can be used to implementate layer-3 point-to-point link.  In other
   hand, DHCP is widely used to assign configuration parameters in
   addtion to IP address.

   This document defines new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4
   and DHCPv6) options to enable a mobile node to obtain the dynamically
   assigned Generic Routing Encapsulation key.  In this way, the mobile
   node achieves to negotiate the uplink/downlink GRE key via DHCP
   signaling.  In this specification, it assumes that the DHCP server
   makes sure the corresponding GRE tunnel endpoint can obtain the
   negotiated GRE key if DHCP server is not co-located with the
   corresponding GRE tunnel endpoint.

2.  Convention and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following term used in this document.

   Uplink GRE Key

      The GRE key is assigned by the DHCP server and used by the mobile
      node, i.e.  DHCP client to mark the uplink traffic that belongs to
      a specific IP connection as described in this specification.

   Downlink GRE Key

      The GRE key is assigned by the DHCP client and used by the
      corresponding GRE tunnel endpoint to mark the downlink traffic
      that belongs to a specific IP connection as described in this
      specification.  In current specification, it is optional for the
      mobile node i.e.  DHCP client side to assign the downlink GRE key.
      If the DHCP cilent does not set the value of the downlink GRE key
      in the option, it is considered that the value of the downlink GRE
      key is equal to the value of uplink GRE key by default.

   Thus, both the uplink GRE key and downlink GRE key are used to
   identify the specific IP connection which are unique within the scope
   of the DHCP client side.

5.  Option Usage

5.1.  Usage of GRE Key Option for DHCPv4

   The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCPv4 options follow the
   rules for DHCP options in [RFC2131].

5.1.1.  Mobile Node Behavior

   In order to request for GRE Key exchanging, the mobile node (i.e.
   DHCP client) MUST include a GRE Key option in the Parameter Request
   List (PRL) in the respective DHCP messages as defined in [RFC2131]
   and [RFC2132].  The DHCP client MAY initiate a new DHCP exchange or
   piggyback on other DHCP message exchanges.  DHCP client-handling PRL
   options are specified in [RFC2131], Section 4.4.

   If the mobile node include GRE Key option and set 0 in the GRE Key
   identifier field, it indicates that the downlink GRE key has the same
   value with the uplink GRE key.  If the mobile node include GRE Key
   option and set non-zero in the GRE Key identifier field, it
   explicitly assigns the downlink GRE key to the corresponding GRE
   tunnel endpoint.  In this specification, the GRE Key identifier field
   is set 0 by default.

   If the mobile node receives the DHCP message sent by the DHCPv4
   server without GRE key option, the mobile node MUST consider that the
   DHCPv4 server does not support the GRE Key option and MUST not
   include the GRE Key option in the subsequent DHCPv4 message.

5.2.  Usage of GRE Key Option for DHCPv6

   The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCPv6 options follow the
   rules for DHCP options in [RFC3315].

5.2.1.  Mobile Node Behavior

   In order to request for GRE Key exchanging, the mobile node (i.e.
   DHCP client) MUST include a GRE Key option in the Option Request
   Option (ORO) in the respective DHCP messages as defined in [RFC3315].
   The DHCP client MAY initiate a new DHCP exchange or piggyback on
   other DHCP message exchanges.  DHCP client-handling ORO options are
   specified in [RFC3315], Section 17.1 and 18.1.

   If the mobile node include GRE Key option and set 0 in the GRE Key
   identifier field, it indicates that the downlink GRE key has the same
   value with the uplink GRE key.  If the mobile node include GRE Key
   option and set non-zero in the GRE Key identifier field, it
   explicitly assigns the downlink GRE key to the corresponding GRE

   tunnel endpoint.  In this specification, the GRE Key identifier field
   is set 0 by default.

   If the mobile node receives the DHCP message sent by the DHCPv6
   server without GRE key option, the mobile node MUST consider that the
   DHCPv6 server does not support the GRE Key option and MUST not
   include the GRE Key option in the subsequent DHCPv6 message.
