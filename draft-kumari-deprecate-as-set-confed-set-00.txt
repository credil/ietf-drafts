             Deprecation of AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET in BGP
              draft-kumari-deprecate-as-set-confed-set-00

Abstract

   RFC 6472 (i.e., BCP 172) recommends not using AS_SET and
   AS_CONFED_SET in BGP.  This document updates RFC 4271 and proscribes
   the use of the AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET types of the AS_PATH in
   BGPv4.  This is done to simplify the design and implementation of BGP
   and to make the semantics of the originator of a route more clear.
   This will also simplify the design, implementation, and deployment of
   ongoing work in the Secure Inter-Domain Routing Working Group.

Internet-Draft    AS_SET, AS_CONFED_SET use deprecation        July 2012


1.  Introduction

   RFC 6472 (i.e., BCP 172) [RFC6472] makes a recommendation for not
   using AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET in BGP.  This document advances the
   recommendation to a standards requirement in BGP.  It updates RFC
   4271 and proscribes the use of the AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET types of
   the AS_PATH in BGPv4.

   The AS_SET path segment type of the AS_PATH attribute (Sections 4.3
   and 5.1.2 of [RFC4271]) is created by a router that is performing
   route aggregation and contains an unordered set of Autonomous Systems
   (ASes) that the update has traversed.  The AS_CONFED_SET path type
   ([RFC5065]) of the AS_PATH attribute is created by a router that is
   performing route aggregation and contains an unordered set of Member
   AS Numbers in the local confederation that the update has traversed.
   It is very similar to AS_SETs but is used within a confederation.

   By performing aggregation, a router is, in essence, combining
   multiple existing routes into a single new route.  This type of
   aggregation blurs the semantics of what it means to originate a
   route.  Said aggregation can therefore cause operational issues, such
   as not being able to authenticate a route origin for the aggregate
   prefix in new BGP security technologies (such as those that take
   advantage of the "X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS
   Identifiers" [RFC3779]).  This in turn would result in reachability
   problems for the aggregated prefix and its components (i.e., more
   specifics).  Said aggregation also creates traffic engineering
   issues, because the precise path information for the component
   prefixes is not preserved.

   From analysis of past Internet routing data, it is apparent that
   aggregation that involves AS_SETs is very seldom used in practice on
   the public network [Analysis] and, when it is used, it is usually
   used incorrectly -- reserved AS numbers ([RFC1930]) and/or only a
   single AS in the AS_SET are by far the most common case.  Because the
   aggregation involving AS_SETs is very rarely used, the reduction in
   table size provided by said aggregation is extremely small, and any
   advantage thereof is outweighed by additional complexity in BGP.  As
   noted above, said aggregation also poses impediments to
   implementation of said new BGP security technologies.

   In the past, AS_SET had been used in a few rare cases to allow route
   aggregation where two or more providers could form the same prefix,
   using the exact match of the other's prefix in some advertisement and
   configuring the aggregation differently elsewhere.  The key to
   configuring this correctly was to form the aggregate at the border in
   the outbound BGP policy and omit prefixes from the AS that the
   aggregate was being advertised to.  The AS_SET therefore allowed this

   practice without the loss of BGP's AS_PATH loop protection.  This use
   of AS_SET served a purpose that fell in line with the original
   intended use.  Without the use of AS_SET, aggregates must always
   contain only less specific prefixes (not less than or equal to), and
   must never aggregate an exact match.


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Recommendation to Network Operators

   Operators MUST NOT generate any new announcements containing AS_SETs
   or AS_CONFED_SETs.  If they have already announced routes with
   AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs in them, then they MUST withdraw those
   routes and re-announce routes for the component prefixes (i.e., the
   more-specifics of the previously aggregated prefix) without AS_SETs
   or CONFED_SETs in the updates.  This involves undoing the aggregation
   that was previously performed (with AS_SETs/CONFED_SETs), and
   announcing more specifics (without AS_SETs/CONFED_SETs).  Route
   aggregation that was previously performed by proxy aggregation (i.e.,
   without the use of AS_SETs) is still possible under some conditions.
   As with any change, the operator should understand the full
   implications of the change.

   It is worth noting that new technologies (such as those that take
   advantage of the "X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS
   Identifiers" [RFC3779]) might not support routes with AS_SETs/
   AS_CONFED_SETs in them, and may treat as infeasible routes containing
   them.  Future BGP implementations may also do the same.  It is
   expected that, even before the deployment of these new or future
   technologies, operators may filter routes with AS_SETs/AS_CONFED_SETs
   in them.  Other than making that observation, this document is not
   intended to make any recommendation for how an operator should behave
   when receiving a route with AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET in it.  This
   document's focus is entirely on the sender side, as discussed in the
   preceding paragraph.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document obsoletes the use of aggregation techniques that create
   AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs.  Future work, intended for securing BGP,
   may update the protocol to remove support for the AS_SET and
   AS_CONFED_SET path segment type of the AS_PATH attribute.  This
   future work will remove complexity and code that are not exercised
   very often, thereby decreasing the attack surface.
