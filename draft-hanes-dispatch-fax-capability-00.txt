                   Indicating Fax over IP Capability
                in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
                 draft-hanes-dispatch-fax-capability-00

Abstract

   This document defines and registers with IANA the new 'fax' media
   feature tag for use with the Session Initialization Protocol (SIP).
   Currently, fax calls are indistinguishable from voice at call setup.
   Consequently, fax calls can be routed to SIP user agents that are not
   fax capable.  A 'fax' media feature tag implemented in conjunction
   with RFC 3841 allows for more accurate fax call routing.

Internet-Draft            Fax Media Feature Tag              August 2012


1.  Introduction

   Fax communications in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) are
   handled in a "voice first" manner.  Indications that a user desires
   to use a fax transport protocol, such as ITU-T T.38, to send a fax
   are not known during the call setup.  The call is set up as a voice
   call first and then only after it is connected, does a switchover to
   the T.38 protocol occur.  This is problematic in that fax calls can
   be routed inadvertently to SIP user agents that are not fax capable.

   To ensure that fax calls are routed to fax capable SIP user agents,
   an implementation of caller preferences defined in RFC 3841 is
   necessary.  Feature preferences are a part of RFC 3841 that would
   allow UAs to express their preference for receiving fax
   communications.  Subsequently SIP servers take these preferences into
   account to increase the likelihood that fax calls land at fax capable
   SIP user agents.

   This document defines the 'fax' media feature tag for use in the SIP
   tree as per Section 12.1 of RFC 3840 [RFC3840].  This feature tag
   will be applied per RFC 3841 as a feature preference for fax capable
   UAs.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "NOT RECOMMENDED" are
   appropriate when valid exceptions to a general requirement are known
   to exist or appear to exist, and it is infeasible or impractical to
   enumerate all of them.  However, they should not be interpreted as
   permitting implementors to fail to implement the general requirement
   when such failure would result in interoperability failure.


3.  Motivation

   Indications of T.38 or other fax protocol desires in the call are not
   known when the call is setup.  Fax calls are always considered voice
   calls until after they are connected.  This results in increased
   chances of fax calls being received by SIP user agents not capable of
   handling fax transmissions.

   For example, Alice wants to send a fax to Bob. Bob registers two SIP
   UAs.  The first SIP UA is not fax capable but the second one supports

   the T.38 fax protocol.  Currently, SIP servers are unable to know
   when the call starts that Alice prefers a fax capable SIP UA to
   handle her call.  Additionally, the SIP servers are also not aware of
   which of Bob's SIP UAs are fax capable.

   An implementation of RFC3841 changes this scenario and feature
   preferences resolve this issue.  With RFC 3841, Alice can express up
   front that she prefers a T.38 fax capable SIP UA for this call.  At
   the same time, Bob's SIP UAs have expressed their fax capabilities as
   well during registration.  Now when Alice places a fax call to Bob,
   the call is appropriately routed to Bob's fax capable SIP UA.


4.  Example

   Bob registers with the fax media feature tag.  The message flow is
   shown in Figure 1:

   from Section 11.1 of RFC 3840 [RFC3840] apply.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification adds a new media feature tag to the SIP Media
   Feature Tag Registration Tree per the procedures defined in RFC 2506
   [RFC2506] and RFC 3840 [RFC3840].

   Media feature tag name:  sip.fax

Internet-Draft            Fax Media Feature Tag              August 2012


   Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag:  This feature tag
      indicates that the device supports fax.

   Values appropriate for use with this feature tag:  Boolean.

   The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
   applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:   This
      feature tag is most useful in a communications application for the
      early identification of a FoIP call.

   Examples of typical use:  Ensuring a fax call is routed to a fax
      capable SIP UA.

   Related standards or documents:  RFCXXXX

   Security Considerations:  Security considerations for this media
      feature tag are discussed in Section 5 of this document.

   [[NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Please change {PH} above to the correct
   identifier for this entry in the IANA registry for
   iso.org.dod.internet.features.sip-tree (1.3.6.1.8.4)]]

   [[NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Please change XXXX to the number assigned to
   this specification, and remove this paragraph on publication.]]

   Forum and the i3 Forum who embarked on a groundbreaking international
   test program for FoIP to improve the interoperability and reliability
   of fax communications over IP networks, especially tandem networks.
   The authors would like to acknowledge the effort and dedication of
   all the members of the Fax-over-IP (FoIP) Task Group in the SIP Forum
   and the communications carriers of the I3 Forum that contributed to
   this global effort.
