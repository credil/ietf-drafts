    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>One of the objectives of the design of <xref target="RFC2460">IPv6
      </xref> has been to reduce or minimize the need for manual configuration
      in networks. <xref target="RFC0791">IPv4 </xref> networks, when it
      became widely deployed in the 1980's, required manual configuration, and
      the scaling limits of the approach quickly became apparent. One of the
      outcomes of that was the <xref target="RFC2131">Dynamic Host
      Configuration Protocol</xref> (DHCP), which facilitated central
      administration of desktop computers. In practice, DHCP itself has been
      of limited utility in the administration of network equipment; while it
      is conceptually possible to use it for any kind of configuration, more
      flexible protocols such as the <xref target="RFC6241">Network
      Configuration Protocol</xref><xref target="RFC6242"></xref> have been
      preferred.</t>

      <t>Allocation of prefixes in small networks calls for an approach that
      can be completely automated. This note documents a procedure that has
      been suggested by several. It builds on a few basic assumptions: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>IPv6 prefixes are allocated to a small network by one or more
          upstream service providers using <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> and
          <xref target="RFC3363"></xref>.</t>

          <t>IPv6 prefixes may allocated to LAN within a small network by the
          CPE Router using <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> and <xref
          target="RFC3363"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Occasional inefficiencies such as allocating two /64s to a LAN
          from a given upstream prefix are acceptable, especially if
          short-lived.</t>

          <t>Small networks, such as described in <xref
          target="I-D.chown-homenet-arch">Home Networking Architecture for
          IPv6</xref>, are simple enough in structure that the mechanism
          described in this note is adequate.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>These assumptions bear analysis. The first two, that prefixes can and
      may be allocated using mechanisms designed for the purpose, seems
      self-evident. The third builds on the IPv6 premise that a host may have
      more than one prefix on an interface and one or more addresses in each
      prefix; in such a case, while it may be suboptimal to allocate more than
      one /64 from the same upstream prefix, the hosts will not complain and
      the routing protocols will route them. The fourth may be considered the
      limit of applicability; if a network requires a prefix aggregation
      design or is otherwise too complex for this procedure to be effective,
      other procedures are more appropriate.</t>

    <section anchor="scope" title="Scope of this Document">
      <t>This document describes a procedure for prefix delegation and
      assignment. It results in the assignment of a series of /64 prefixes on
      the links in a small home network.</t>

      <t>While this document describes the use of DHCPv6 for prefix
      delegation, specification of the use of DHCPv6 for address assignment
      and other purposes is out of scope.</t>

      <t>If a network includes interior routers and the CPE router is not
      directly to all of the links in the network, the routers in the network
      will need routing information to forward traffic in the network and
      between the network and the service provider network. The specification
      of a routing protocol or other mechanism to provide that routing
      information to the routers is beyond the scope of this document.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="simple_tree" title="Simple Tree Network Case">
      <t>The first case to describe is that of a network with a simple tree
      topology. In this network, there is a single CPE router attached to a
      single SP network. The interior of the network is organized as a tree.
      Each interior router has one "upstream" interface and one or more
      "downstream" interfaces. Each link in the network has a single interior
      router with a downstream interface attached and zero or more interior
      routers with an upstream interface attached.</t>

      <t>The fundamental procedure for prefix allocation takes three phases:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>Allocating a prefix from the upstream network,</t>

          <t>Prefix allocation by the CPE Router, and</t>

          <t>Prefix allocation by a subsequent router.</t>
        </list></t>

      <section anchor="dhcp"
               title="Assignment of prefixes in a simple network">
        <t>This section describes the assignment of prefixes in a simple
        network. The network is assumed to be tree-structured, including one
        CPE router that is connected to a SP network and one or more interior
        routers. The interior routers each have a single "upstream" interface
        and one or more "downstream" interfaces. The upstream interface of
        each interior router is connected to a link in the network to which a
        downstream interface of a router closer to the CPE router is already
        connected.</t>

        <t>The CPE router obtains a delegated prefix for the entire home
        network, and manages prefix allocations for all of the interior
        routers. Each interior router uses DHCPv6 on its upstream interface to
        obtain delegated prefixes from the CPE router for each of the interior
        routers downstream interfaces.</t>

        <section anchor="CPE_Router" title="CPE Router Behavior">
          <t>The CPE router obtains a delegated prefix from the SP
          provisioning system using <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> and <xref
          target="RFC3363"></xref> and other appropriate provisioning systems.
          The prefix delegated from the service provider includes a preferred
          and valid lifetime for the prefix.</t>

          <t>Once the CPE router has received a delegated prefix, it assigns a
          /64 subprefix to each of the links to which the router is attached.
          The CPE router configures an address to each of its interfaces from
          the prefix assigned to the link to which the interface is
          attached.</t>

          <t>After assigning the interface addresses, the CPE router begins
          sending Router Advertisement (RA) messages <xref
          target="RFC4861"></xref> advertising the appropriate prefix on each
          attached link. The RAs include preferred and valid lifetimes derived
          from the lifetimes associated with the delegated prefix from the
          service provider. The RA also advertises the CPE router as the
          default router for the link. Other fields in the RAs are set as
          appropriate.</t>

          <t>At this point, the links to which the CPE router is attached are
          now provisioned with prefixes taken from the prefix obtained from
          the service provider. The CPE router uses ongoing DHCPv6 messages
          exchanges according to <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> and <xref
          target="RFC3363"></xref> to maintain and update its delegated
          prefix.</t>

          <t>The CPE router implements a DHCPv6 server for prefix
          subdelegation throughout the rest of the network. In preparation for
          assigning prefixes to links in the rest of the network, the CPE
          router makes all of the remaining prefixes from the network prefix
          available for subdelegation through a DHCPv6 server. The CPE router
          configures the preferred and valid lifetimes for the subdelegated
          prefixes from the values received from the service provider.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="interior_router" title="Interior Router Behavior">
          <t>When an interior router is connected to the home network, its
          upstream interface is attached to a link in the home network, and
          its downstream interfaces are connected to other links to be added
          to the home network.</t>

          <section anchor="tree_topology" title="Network with a Tree Topology">
            <t>After the upstream interface is attached to a link, the
            interior router listens for RAs on the upstream interface and
            configures the upstream interface according to the information
            contained in the received RAs.</t>

            <t>When the interior router receives an RA, the router initiates a
            DHCPv6 message exchange to obtain any needed prefixes from the
            prefix managed by the allocating router. The interior router
            requests the delegation of a separate /64 prefix for each of its
            downstream interfaces. The DHCPv6 service in the home network
            delivers the DHCPv6 traffic between the interior router and the
            CPE router.</t>

            <t>The CPE router delegates the requested prefixes from the prefix
            delegated to the network. The interior router then assigns a
            prefix to each link attached to which a downstream interface is
            attached, configures those downstream interfaces with addresses
            from the assigned prefixes and begins sending RAs on the
            downstream interfaces. The preferred and valid lifetimes for the
            advertised prefix are derived from the lifetimes in the DHCPv6
            delegation, and the RAs advertise the interior router as the
            default router for the link.</t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="non-tree_topology" title="Non-tree Topologies">
            <t>It is quite likely that real world deployments will violate the
            assumption in the previous section that only one downstream
            interface will be attached to each link in the home network. In
            this situation, it is desirable that the link only be assigned one
            prefix and, therefore, only one of the interior routers with a
            downstream interface on the link be responsible for assigning a
            prefix and sending RAs on the link.</t>

            <t>To avoid duplicate address assignment, a router first listens
            for RAs on the link attached to its downstream interface. If the
            router does not receive an RA after listening for INTERVAL1
            microfortnights, the router assumes it is responsible for
            assigning a prefix to that link and initiates the DHCPv6 process
            for obtaining a delegated prefix.</t>

            <t>After the router determines it is responsible for the link
            attached to its downstream interface, it continues to listen for
            RAs from other routers on the link. If it receives an RA from
            another router, it deassigns its delegated prefix from the link,
            unconfigures any addresses assigned from that prefix and releases
            the delegated prefix to the CPE router using DHCPv6. <list>
                <t>Discussion: there is a race condition in this; two routers
                may make the decision to manage the link's prefix
                simultaneously. To avoid this, the timing should be jittered
                enough to make this unlikely.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>If a router hears an RA such as described in <xref
            target="interior_router"></xref>, it uses <xref
            target="RFC4862">IPv6 Stateless Address
            Autoconfiguration</xref><xref target="RFC4941"></xref> or a <xref
            target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref> request to each announced allocator
            to generate an address within the prefix for use in that
            subnet.</t>

            <t>After the router determines that some other router is
            responsible for the link attached to its downstream interface, it
            continues to listen on the interface for RAs. If the router
            receives no RA on the interface for INTERVAL2 microfortnights, the
            router takes responsibility for the link and initiates the process
            described above to obtain and assign a prefix to the link.</t>

          <section anchor="multihomed_net" title="Multi-homed Network">
            <t>If a network has multiple service provider networks, it will
            have multiple prefixes. This situation is easiest to describe if
            the network is connected to each service provider through a
            separate CPE router.</t>

            <t>Each CPE router obtains a delegated prefix from its service

      <t>There are a number of potential issues in this procedure.</t>

      <section title="Sequence of subnet number allocation">
        <t>Apart from cases in which the administration has chosen to fix a
        given subnet to a given LAN, such as to support server deployment in
        DNS, it is generally advised that subnet numbers be randomized. This
        is to make certain network attacks a little more difficult.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="multihoming" title="Multihoming Issues">
        <t>One issue is "what happens if one has multiple upstream networks
        with multiple CPE Routers and therefore multiple allocators?" The
        design of the RA information element announcing the allocator is
        intended to simplify that by announcing an allocator.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="racing" title="Race Conditions">
        <t>In the simplest case, there are no race conditions; the home has
        exactly one router, it obtains a prefix from its upstream network, and
        sub-allocates to its interfaces. If there are additional routers in
        the home, however, either there are one or more links that are not
        attached to the CPE Router or there are zero; in the event that there
        are one or more such links, they may be connected by one router or by
        multiple routers.</t>

        <t>One race condition is when two interior routers are attached to the
        same LANs as the CPE. For example, one might have a wireless router in
        the home that connects both to the wired and the wireless network that
        the CPE Router is on. In such a case, it will hear and interpret one
        of the CPE Router's RAs first, and then the other some amount of time
        later. The purpose of the INTERVAL1 delay in <xref
        target="interior_router"></xref> is to allow this race condition to
        stabilize before the router acts on this information it has.</t>

        <t>A second race condition occurs when two "subsequent" routers are on
        the same LAN but it is not serviced by the CPE Router. These routers
        will both use the procedure of <xref target="interior_router"></xref>
        to attempt to allocate a prefix to the LAN and so create a subnet. It
        is RECOMMENDED that the allocator allocate at most one prefix per
        INTERVAL2, ignoring all other requests, in order to allow the
        "subsequent" routers to sort out this class of race condition. If
        needed, ignored routers will re-request the allocation.</t>

        <t>Due to the possibility of packet loss in the network, it is
        possible that these race conditions may result in a given LAN
        developing multiple subnets. While suboptimal, this is not a violation
        of the architecture and should cause no issues. However, in the event
        that two routers observe that they are announcing different subnets in
        the same upstream prefix on the same LAN, the one with the numerically
        least subnet number SHOULD NOT allow its prefix to expire, but any
        others SHOULD allow their prefixes to expire.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="scaling" title="Scaling Issues">
        <t>Obviously, use of this procedure in a complex network results in a
        serialization of prefix allocation that may take more time to settle
        than is operationally desirable (number of LANs times INTERVAL2). In
        such cases, the administration will have to decide how it wants to
        handle the issue. One approach would be to divide the network into
        easily-aggregated sections and use the procedure within each section;
        another would be to use a different procedure.</t>

        <t>In such networks, the routers requesting prefixes can also act as a
        denial of service attack, by flooding the CPE Router with requests.
        Given that the procedure eventually terminates, this is undesirable
        but of limited duration.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="stability" title="Prefix Stability">
        <t>In networks that contain servers or names that are announced in
        DNS, it is often valuable to have the same LAN always have the same
        subnet number applied to it. The procedure as described could
        accomplish that if the CPE Router maintains memory of what router it
        has allocated a given prefix to recently, or would fail to provide
        that if it does not. The distinction is essentially a marketing
        requirement that the implementation will need to decide for
        itself.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="toosmall" title="When you run out of prefixes">
        <t>If a network runs out of subnet numbers and therefore subnet
        prefixes, this is considered a provisioning failure. It can result
        when multiple prefixes are allocated to the same LAN, which should be
        unusual and will end when one of the routers releases its prefix. It
        can also result when the upstream network allocates a prefix that is
        too long and as a result contains too few potential prefixes. In that
        case, the administration is forced to either reorganize its network or
        negotiate for a shorter prefix.</t>
