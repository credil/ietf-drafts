1. Introduction

   As part of IPv4 to IPv6 migration, there are multiple
   standards developed for smooth transition for Unicast.
   Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps] specifies
   different possible scenarios for IPv4 to IPv6 multicast
   transition as below,

      1. IPv4 Receiver and Source connected over IPv6-Only
        network
      2. IPv6 Receiver Connected to IPv4 Source through IPv4
        multicast access network and IPv6 Multicast network.
      3. IPv6 Receiver and Source connected to IPv4-Only network.
      4. IPv6 Receiver and IPv4 Source.
      5. IPv4 Receiver and IPv6 Source.

Internet-Draft Well-Known Prefix for V4V6 Mcast Translation  August 2012


   Section 3.6 of [I-D.ietf-mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps] identifies the
   use cases involving IPv4 source as highest priority.

   There are also various solutions proposed (ex., [I-D.ietf-
   softwire-mesh-multicast], [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-
   multicast]) addressing the above use cases requirement which
   requires to embed IPv4 multicast address into IPv6 address.
   This IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address will be used as
   group address within IPv6 cloud.

   There were multiple options considered and discussed and this
   draft is to document Well-known prefix option.

   This document reserves 2 Well-Known prefixes from IPv6
   Multicast address range which will be used for IPv4-IPv6
   transition.



2. Terminology



   (S4, G4)/(*, G4): (S, G) or (*, G) in IPv4 address format

   (S6, G6)/(*, G6): (S, G) or (*, G) in IPv6 address format

   SSM64PREFIX: Well-Known prefix reserved for SSM range IPv6
   Multicast address as specified in Section 3.1.

   ASM64PREFIX: Well-Known prefix reserved for ASM range IPv6
   Multicast address as specified in Section 3.2.



3. Well-Known Prefix

   This document reserves the below two address prefixes from
   IPv6 Multicast address range for IPv4-IPv6 transition.



3.1. SSM64PREFIX Format

   SSM64PREFIX is the prefix reserved from IPv6 SSM range
   represented as below,

4. Well-Known Prefix Usage

   This document doesn't propose any procedure to define the
   usage of the reserved well-known IPv6 Multicast prefix. Any
   solution proposed to solve the transition problem mentioned
   in [I-D.ietf-mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps] may use this reserved
   prefixes.

5. Use Cases

   In this document, we also describe the behavior of one high
   priority scenario with above procedure.

   AFBR1 on receiving (S4, G4) or (*, G4) PIM Join or IGMP
   Report will perform the below,



      1. If Upstream is IPv6 PIM neighbor and if G4 is from ASM
        range, should embed the IPv4 multicast group into last
        32 bits of ASM64PREFIX and send PIMv6 JOIN towards
        remote AFBR.
      2. If Upstream is IPv6 PIM router, and if G4 is from SSM
        range, should embed the IPv4 multicast group into last
        32 bits of SSM64PREFIX and send PIMv6 JOIN upstream.


6. Security Considerations

   This document reserves 2 IPv6 Multicast prefixes for Ipv4-
   IPv6 transition purpose. The same security considerations

Internet-Draft Well-Known Prefix for V4V6 Mcast Translation  August 2012


   apply as those for [RFC6052]. This document doesn't introduce
   any new security issues.



7. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to reserve 2 variable scope IPv6 Multicast
   prefixes for IPv4-IPv6 transition purpose. These should be the
   /96 prefixes;



   SSM Range - FF3x:0:0:04E6::/96

   ASM Range - FF0x:0:0:04E6::/96
