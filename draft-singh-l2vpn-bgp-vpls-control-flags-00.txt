INTERNET DRAFT         Control Flags for BGP VPLS       October 21, 2013


1  Introduction

   The use of control word (CW) helps prevent mis-ordering of IPv4 or
   IPv6 PW traffic over ECMP-paths/LAG-bundles. [RFC4385] describes the
   format for control-word that may be used over point-2-point PWs and
   over a VPLS.

   [RFC4761] describes the concepts and signaling for using BGP to bring
   up a VPLS. It specifies as part of its BGP VPLS NLRI that a PE may
   require other PEs in the same VPLS to include (or not) control-word
   and sequencing information in VPLS frames sent to this PE.

   However, [RFC4761] does not describe the behavior of PEs in a mixed
   environment where some PEs support control-word/sequencing and others
   do not.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2  Problem

   [RFC4761] uses a VPLS BGP NLRI to specify the required behavior off
   multiple PEs. The behavior required off the multiple PEs identified
   by the NLRI indicates the VPLS label they should use in the VPLS
   traffic being forwarded to this PE. Additionally, by using the
   "control flags" it specifies whether the other PEs (in the same VPLS)
   should use control-word or sequenced-delivery for packets forwarded
   to this PE. These are respectively indicated by the C and the S bits
   in the "control flags" as specified in section 3.2.4 in [RFC4761].

   [RFC4761] requires that if the advertising PE sets the C and S bits,
   the receiving PE MUST honor the same by inserting control word (CW)
   and by including sequence numbers respectively.

   However, in a BGP VPLS deployment there would often be cases where a
   PE receiving the VPLS BGP NLRI may not have the ability to insert a
   CW or include sequencing information inside PW frames. In that case
   the behavior of BGP VPLS needs to be further specified.

   This document enhances the meaning of the control flags in layer2
   extended community in the BGP VPLS NLRI for an environment where not
   every PE in a a VPLS has the ability or the configuration to honor
   the control flags received from the PE advertising the BGP NLRI.

3  Updated meaning of control flags in the layer2 info extended
   community

   Currently, the CW setting is not negotiated. Rather, if a PE sets the
   C-bit, it expects to receive VPLS packets with a control word, and
   will send packets the same way.  If the PEs at both ends of a
   pseudowire don't agree on the setting of the C-bit, the PW doesn't
   come up.  Similarly for the S-bit.     

   This memo changes the meaning of the C-bit and the S-bit in the
   control flags.  If a PE sets the C-bit in its NLRI, it means that the
   PE can send and receive packets with a control word.  If the PEs at
   both ends of a PW set the C-bit, control words are used in both
   directions of the PW.  If both PEs send a C-bit of 0, control words
   are not used on the PW.  These two cases behave as before.

   However, if the PEs don't agree on the setting of the C-bit, control
   words are not used on that PW.  This behavior is new; the old
   behavior is that the PW doesn't come up.

   The behavior for the S-bit is similar. 

4  Using p2mp LSP as transport for CW-marked VPLS frames

   BGP VPLS can be used over either point-2-point LSPs acting as
   transport between the VPLS PEs. Alternately, BGP VPLS may also be
   used over p2mp LSPs with the source of the p2mp LSPs rooted at the PE
   advertising the VPLS BGP NLRI. 

   In a network that uses p2mp LSPs as transport for BGP VPLS, in a
   given VPLS there may be some PEs that support control-word while
   others do not. In such a setup, a source PE that supports control-
   word / sequenced-delivery should setup 2 different p2mp trees - one
   which has as its leaves those VPLS PEs that are advertising the C/S-
   bits as 1, and another p2mp LSP whose leaves are PEs that are not
   advertising C/S-bits as 1.

                           Figure 1: Example of a VPLS


   In the above topology, let there be a VPLS configured with the PEs as
   displayed. Let PE1 be the PE under consideration that is CW enabled.
   Let PE2 and PE3 also be CW enabled. Let PE4 not be CW enabled. PE1
   will advertise a VPLS BGP NLRI, containing the C/S bits marked as 1.
   PE2 and PE3 on learning of NLRI from PE1, shall include the control
   word in VPLS frames being forwarded to PE1. However, PE4 which does
   not have the ability to include control-word.

   As per [RFC4761], PE1 would have an expectation that all other PEs
   forward traffic to it by including CW.

   However, to support the mixed-CW environment as above, PE1 will bring
   up the PW with PE4 despite the CW mismatch. Additionally, it will
   setup its data-plane such that it will strip the control-word only
   for those VPLS packets that are received from PEs that are themselves
   indicating their desire to receive CW marked packets. So, PE1 will
   setup its data plane to strip-off the CW only for VPLs frames
   received from PEs PE2 and PE3. PE1 will setup its data plane to not
   strip CW from frames received from PE4.

6  Security Considerations

   No new security issues.
