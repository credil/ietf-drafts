               IPv6 6RD IPCP configuration option for PPP
                   draft-freedman-pppext-ipv6-6rd-00

Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) (RFC1661) provides a standard
   method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point
   links.  PPP defines an extensible Link Control Protocol and a family
   of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and configuring
   different network-layer protocols.

   This document extends the NCP for establishing and configuring the
   Internet Protocol over PPP (RFC1332), defining the negotiation of 6RD
   (RFC5969) Border Relay (BR) addresses.  While the authors believe one
   could use DHCP INFORM (RFC2131) to obtain the necessary 6RD
   parameters, this is simply an alternative which allows reuse of an
   existing PPP-based configuration infrastructure.

Internet-Draft        6RD IPCP configuration option            July 2011


1.  Introduction

   PPP [RFC1661], and PPPoE [RFC2516], remains a common way for a
   residential broadband end user to obtain configuration.  In such
   deployments, no DHCP [RFC2131], infrastructure may be in place and IP
   configuration is solely obtained from RADIUS [RFC2865] servers and
   network equipment via IPCP [RFC1332].  The PPP IPCP option presents
   configuration information to the local peer such that it may join a
   6RD [RFC5969] domain.

2.  Terminology

   6RD IPv6 Prefix

      An IPv6 prefix selected by the service provider for use by a 6RD
      domain.  There is exactly one 6RD IPv6 prefix for a given 6RD
      domain.  An SP may deploy 6RD with a single 6RD domain or multiple
      6RD domains.

   6RD Delegated Prefix

      The IPv6 prefix calculated by the local peer for use within the
      customer site by combining the 6RD prefix and the local peer IPv4
      address obtained via IPv4 configuration methods.  This prefix can
      be considered logically equivalent to a DHCPv6 IPv6 delegated
      prefix [RFC3633].

   6RD Domain

      A service provider may deploy 6RD with a single 6RD domain, or may
      utilize multiple 6RD domains.  Each domain requires a seperate 6RD
      IPv6 prefix.

   6RD Border Relay (BR)

      A 6RD-enabled router managed by the service provider at the edge
      of a 6RD domain.  A Border Relay router provides an endpoint for
      the 6RD IPv6 in IPv4 tunnel.  A 6RD BR may also be referred to
      simply as a "BR" within the context of 6RD.

   6RD BR address

      The IPv4 address of the 6RD Border Relay for a given 6RD domain.
      This IPv4 address is used by the local peer to send packets to a
      BR in order to reach IPv6 destinations outside of the 6RD domain.

3.  6RD IPCP configuration option

   Description:

      This Configuration Option provides a method for informing the
      local peer of the configuration parameters required for the 6RD
      domain available for the peer to join.

   Type:

      TBA

   Length:

      The total length of the IPCP option, in octets

   V4Prefix-Length

      Prefix length of the common part of the encoded IPv4 address in
      number of bits.  This number of bits MUST be removed from leftmost
      of the IPv4 address when generating the 6RD Delegated Prefix.  For
      example, if this value is 8, 24 bits of the subscriber IPv4 prefix
      will be used when creating the IPv6 Delegated Prefix, determining
      the destination IPv4 encapsulation address, etc.  If the value is
      0, then the whole 32 bits of the IPv4 address is used in the
      encoding.

5.  Security Considerations

   This memo does not present any security considerations, it is assumed
   that the remote peer is trusted and therefore the parameters of the
   6RD domain are to be trusted.
