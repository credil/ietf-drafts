  Routes Optimization for Multicast Sender in Proxy Mobile IPv6 Domain
               draft-liu-multimob-pmipv6-multicast-ro-02

Abstract

   To support IP multicasting in PMIPv6 domain, MULTIMOB WG has issued
   several proposals including the base solution, dedicated schemes and
   direct routing which requires all communications to go through the
   local mobility anchor(LMA), the dedicated server and the native
   multicasting infrastructure, respectively.  As this can be
   suboptimal, this document describes multicast routes optimazition
   mechanisms for multicast sender.  Multicast sender attached to the
   same or different mobile access gateways(MAG) with multicast listener
   sends multicast data via the tunnel between the gateways without any
   dedicated devices or dependence of the native multicasting
   infrastructure.  The MAG and the LMA are the mobility entities
   defined in the PMIPv6 protocol and act as PIM-SM routers.

1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] enables network-based mobility
   for IPv6 mobile nodes (MNs) that do not implement any mobility
   protocols.  The Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) is the topological anchor
   point to manages the mobile node's binding state.  The Mobile Access
   Gateway (MAG) is an access router or gateway that manages the
   mobility-related signaling for an MN.  An MN is attached to the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 Domain (PMIPv6-Domain) that includes LMA and MAG(s), and
   is able to receive data coming from outside of the PMIPv6-Domain
   through LMA and MAG.

   Network-based mobility support for unicast is addressed in [RFC5213],
   while multicast support in PMIPv6 is not discussed in it.  In order
   to deploy the multicast service in the PMIPv6 domain, many schemes
   have been proposed:

   The base solution described in [RFC6224] provides options for
   deploying multicast listener functions in PMIPv6-Domains without
   modifying mobility and multicast protocol standards.  However, in
   this specification, MAG MUST act as an MLD proxy [RFC4605] and hence
   MUST dedicate a tunnel link between LMA and MAG to an upstream
   interface for all multicast traffic.  It requires all the LMA to
   forward multicast packets to MAG via PMIPv6 tunnel which can be
   suboptimal.

   [draft-ietf-multimob-pmipv6-ropt-00]uses a multicast tree mobility
   anchor(MTMA) as the topological anchor point for multicast traffic,
   as well as a direct routing option where the MAG can provide access
   to multicast content in the local network.  All the multicast traffic
   has to go through the MAG-MTMA tunnel which result in suboptimal
   multicast routing path like the base solution.  And the direct
   routing solution needs native multicasting infrastructure as a
   requirement.

   [draft-ietf-multimob-pmipv6-source-01]describes the support of
   multicast senders in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains.  MLD proxy functions
   are deployed at the MAG.  Multicast traffic MUST be tunneled up to
   the LMA of the multicast sender, transferred to the LMA of the
   multicast listener and then tunneled downwards to the MAG of the
   multicast listener.  The problem is especially manifested when
   multicast listener and sender attach to the same MAG but different
   LMAs, the traffic has to go up to one LMA, cross over to the other
   LMA, and then be tunneled back to the same MAG, causing non-optimal
   multicast routes and redundant flows at the MAG.In the direct routing
   scenario when PIM-SM and PIM-SSM are deployed in MAGs, Source-
   specific shortest path trees(SPT) have to follow LMA-MAG tunnels
   towards the multicast sender which can be suboptimal.

   As shown in Figure 2, MN1(the multicast Listener) and MN2(the
   multicast sender) are both mobile nodes in the same PMIPv6 domain,
   they both have binding cache entry in the LMA.  MN1 sends (S,G)
   subscribe message(MLD Report messages) to the access link to
   establish the SPT, MN1 has to operate as an "SSM-aware" host
   [RFC4604].  On receiving the (S,G) subscribe message from MN1, the

   attached MAG1 sends a PBU-Q message to LMA to query the CoA (i. e.,
   IP address of MAG2) of MN2.  On the reception of PBU-Q, the LMA
   responds with a PBA-Q message including the CoA of MN2 to MAG1.
   After acquiring the CoA of MN2, MAG1 establishes bi-directional
   tunnel with MAG2, and sends PIM Join message to MAG2 through this
   tunnel, MAG1 and MAG2 establish the ralated muticast state.  So the
   MAG-based SPT is established successfully and the subsequent
   multicast data flow will be transmitted through the MAG-based SPT
   which is represented by "=O" in Figure 2.  Unicast data flow will be
   transmitted through base PMIPv6 tunnel which is represented by "||"
   in Figure 2.

   The tunnel between MAG1 and MAG2 is used for multicast
   packets(including signaling and data flow) transmission only.

   As described in [RFC4601], on receipt of data from S to G on
   interface iif (incoming interface of the packet), the DR will firstly
   check whether the source is directly connected and the iif is
   identical to the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) interface.  As shown
   in Figure 2, MAG2 is the DR of MN2, MAG1 is the DR of MN1.  After
   tunnel establishment between MAG1 and MAG2, MAG1 add the tunnel route
   to the MRIB, the RPF check will be successful.

   This draft assumes that every MN supporting multicast service is
   previously registered in the PMIPv6 unicast domain to get a unicast
   IP address(HoA).


4.  Protocol Operation

4.1.  Add Route to MRIB

   In PIM-SM, the MRIB is used to decide where to send Join/Prune
   messages. on receiving the MLD Report message from MN,the MAG of MN
   has to choose a RPF Neighbor that the MRIB indicates should be used
   to forward packets to, and then send the Join/Prune message to the
   RPF Neighbor.

   After tunnel establishment between MAG1 and MAG2, MAG1 add the tunnel
   route to the MRIB, so that the RPF Neighbor of MAG1 is MAG2, MAG1
   send PIM Join/Prune message through this tunnel.

4.2.  Optimized Multicast Route Establishment

   This section provides the multicast routes optimization procedure.The
   procedures are described as follows and illustrated in Figure 3.

             Figure3 Procedure of establishing multicast Route

   1.MN1 sends (S,G) subscribe message to the access link, S is the HoA
   of MN2.

   2.On receiving the (S,G) subscribe message from MN1, the attached
   MAG1 sends a PBU-Q message to LMA to query the CoA (i. e., IP address
   of MAG2) of MN2.

   3.On the reception of PBU-Q, the LMA responds with a PBA-Q message
   including the CoA of MN2.

   4.After acquire the CoA of MN2, MAG1 establish bi-directional tunnel
   with MAG2.

   5.After tunnel establishment, MAG1 add the tunnel route to the MRIB,
   so that the RPF Neighbor of MAG1 is MAG2.

   6.If there are multicast channels the MN1 has subscribed but MAG1 has
   not yet subscribed, MAG1 establishes multicast state for the channel,
   and sets the iif of the multicast state as MAG1-MAG2 tunnel
   interface. if MAG1 already subscribed the channel, MAG1 updates the
   iif of the multicast state as MAG1-MAG2 tunnel interface.

   7.MAG1 joins the corresponding multicast channels by sending the PIM
   Join message to the RPF Neighbor MAG2 through the MAG1-MAG2 tunnel.

   8.On the reception of PIM Join message from MAG1, If MAG2 has not yet
   subscribed the multicast channel, MAG2 establishes multicast state
   for the channel, and adds the MAG2-MAG1 tunnel interface to the
   oiflist of the multicast state. if MAG2 already subscribed the
   channel, MAG2 updates the oiflist of the multicast state by adding
   the MAG2-MAG1 tunnel interface to the oiflist.

   9.The subsequent multicast data flow will be transmitted through the
   optimized multicast route(MAG1-MAG2 bi-directional tunnel).

               Figure4 Procedure of deleting multicast Route

   1.MN1 sends (S,G) leave message(MLD Report messages) to the access
   link, S is the HoA of MN2.

   2.On receiving the (S,G) leave message from the MN1, if MAG1 figures
   that MN1 is the last multicast listener subscribed to the MN2, MAG1
   perform the following steps, otherwise, MAG1 simply delete the
   multicast state of MN1 as normal, which is removing MAG1-MN1
   interface from the oiflist of the multicast state.

   3.MAG1 delete all the multicast state related to MN2.

   4.MAG1 remove the tunnel route from the MRIB and leave the
   corresponding multicast channels by sending the PIM Prune message to
   the RPF Neighbor MAG2 through the MAG1-MAG2 tunnel.

   5.On the reception of PIM Prune message from MAG1, MAG2 updates the
   oiflist of the multicast state by removing the MAG2-MAG1 tunnel

   interface from the oiflist.

   6.Remove bi-directional tunnel between MAG1 and MAG2.

4.4.  Multicast sender handover

   When the multicast sender handover from the old MAG to a new MAG.
   From the old MAG, the new MAG gets the addresses of all the distant
   MAGs(MAGs attached by the multicast listeners that have subscribed to
   the multicast sender) according to the multicast states that match
   the moving multicast sender.  The new MAG establishes tunnels with
   the distant MAGs and notify these distant MAGs to update their
   multicast states so the multicast listeners could receive traffic
   through the new tunnel between the new MAG and the distant MAGs.

   TODO details.

4.5.  Multicast listener handover

   When the multicast listener handover from the old MAG to a new MAG.
   From the old MAG, the new MAG gets all the active multicast
   subscriptions that match the moving multicast listener and then
   reestablishes the multicast route the same way as describe in section
   4.2.

   TODO details.

4.6.  ASM Scecario

   In this scenario,PIM-SM first establishes as usual RP-based
   distribution tree(RPT) and SPT in phase one and phase two.  In phase
   three,the DR(MAG) on the multicast listener's side will choose to
   initiate a transfer from the shared tree to a source-specific
   shortest-path tree (SPT).

   At this point the DR knows the HoA of the multicast sender,it then
   gets the CoA of the multicast sender from LMA and establishes the
   shortest path tree the way as described in section 4.2.

   TODO details.


5.  Local Mobility Anchor Operation

   On receiving a PBU-Q message from MAG1, the LMA must perform the
   following operations.

   1.Check if the PBU-Q message contains the Q flag set to 1.

   2.Query the CoA of MN2 by looking up the binding cache of LMA.

   3.If the corresponding HoA-CoA entry is found in the binding cache,
   LMA will respond PBA-Q message containing a success indication.
   Otherwise, if not found, LMA will respond PBA-Q message containing a
   failure indication.

   The responding PBA-Q message from LMA to MAG1 is constructed as
   follows.

   1.Source address field in the IP header must be set to IP address of
   LMA.

   2.Destination address filed in the IP header must be set to IP
   address of the MAG1.

   3.The PBA-Q message MUST include the CoA of MN2.


6.  Mobile Access Gateway Operation

   The MAG MUST operate as an "SSM-aware" router.  [RFC4604] provide the
   behavior of an "SSM-aware" router.

6.1.  MN1 and MN2 attach to the same MAG

   On receiving the (S,G) subscribe message from the MN1, MAG1 could
   decide whether MN2 attachs to itself according to MN2's HoA which is
   included in the (S,G) subscribe message.  If MAG1 figures that MN1
   and MN2 both attach to it.  MAG1 operates as below:

   If there are multicast channels the MN1 has subscribed but MAG1 has
   not yet subscribed, MAG1 establishes multicast state for the
   channel,and adds the MAG1-MN1 interface to the oiflist of the
   multicast state.

   If MAG1 already subscribed the channel, MAG1 updates the oiflist of
   the multicast state by adding the MAG1-MN1 interface to the oiflist.

   MAG1 will send the multicast data flow from MN2 to MN1 locally.

6.2.  MN1 and MN2 attach to different MAG

   The PBU-Q message from MAG1 to LMA MUST be constructed, as specified
   below.

   1.Source address field in the IP header must contain the IP address
   of MAG1.

     Figure5 Proxy Binding Update with Source Address Query Extension

   A Binding Update message that is sent by MAG to LMA is referred to as
   the "Proxy Binding Source Address Query" message.  A new flag (Q) is
   included in the Proxy Binding Update message with Source Address
   Query extension (PBU-Q).  The rest of the Binding Update message
   format remains the same as defined in[RFC3775] and with the
   additional (R), (M), and (P) flags, as specified in [RFC3963],
   [RFC4140], and [RFC5213], respectively.

   Source Address Query Flag

   A new flag (Q) is included in the Binding Update message to indicate
   to LMA that the Binding Update message is a Source Address Query
   message.  In the normal PMIP operation, the flag must be set to 0.

   The PBU-Q message is transfered for quering the MN2's CoA.  The rest
   of the PBU message remains unchanged.

     Figure6 Proxy Binding Update with Source Address Query Extension

   A "Proxy Binding Acknowledgement" message is sent from LMA to MAG in
   response to a Proxy Binding Update message.  A new flag (Q) is
   included in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message with Source
   Address Query extension (PBA-Q).  The rest of the Binding
   Acknowledgement message format remains the same as defined in

   and [RFC5213], respectively.

   Source Address Query Flag

   A new flag (Q) is included in the Binding Acknowledgement message to
   indicate to MAG that the Binding Acknowledgement message is a Source
   Address Query message.  In the normal PMIP operation, the flag must
   be set to 0.

   When (Q) flag is specified in PBA-Q message, the mobility options
   field includes "MN2's CoA"(Section 8.3).
