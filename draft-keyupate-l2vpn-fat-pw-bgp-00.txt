         Flow-Aware Transport of Pseudowires Extension for BGP
                 draft-keyupate-l2vpn-fat-pw-bgp-00.txt

Abstract

   [RFC6391] describes a mechanism that uses an additional label (Flow
   Label) in the MPLS label stack that allows Label Switch Routers to
   balance flows within Pseudowires at a finer granularity than the
   individual Pseudowires across the Equal Cost Multiple Paths (ECMPs)
   that exists within the Packet Switched Network (PSN).

   Furthermore,[RFC6391] defines the LDP protocol extensions required to
   synchronize the flow label states between the ingress and egress PEs
   when using the signaling procedures defined in the [RFC4447].

   This draft defines protocol extensions required to synchronize flow
   label states among PEs when using the BGP-based signaling procedures
   defined in [RFC4761].  These protocol extensions are equally
   applicable to point-to-point L2VPNs defined in [RFC6624].

Internet-DraftFlow-Aware Transport of PWs Extension for BGP October 2013


   A pseudowire (PW)[RFC3985] is normally transported over one single
   network path, even if multiple Equal Cost Multiple Paths (ECMPs)
   exist between the ingress and egress PW provider edge (PE) equipment.
   This is required to preserve the characteristics of the emulated
   service.  The use of a single path to preserve the packet delivery
   order remains the default mode of operation of a PW and is described
   in [RFC4385], [RFC4928].

   Using the principles defined in [RFC6391], this draft augments the
   BGP-signaling procedures of [RFC4761] and [RFC6624] to allow an
   OPTIONAL mode that may be employed when the use of ECMPs is known to
   be beneficial to the operation of the PW.

   High bandwidth Ethernet-based services are a prime example that
   benefits from the ability to load-balance flows in a PW over multiple
   PSN paths.  In general, this notion is applicable to cases where the
   ratio between the PW access speed and the PSNs core link bandwidth is
   large.

   To achieve the load-balancing goal,[RFC6391] introduces the notion of
   an additional Label Stack Entry (LSE) (Flow label) located at the
   bottom of the stack (right after PW LSE).  Label Switching Routers
   (LSRs) commonly generate a hash of the label stack in order to
   discriminate and distribute flows over available ECMPs.  The presence
   of the Flow label (closely associated to a flow determined by the
   ingress PE) will normally provide the greatest entropy.

   Furthermore, following the procedures for Inter-AS scenarios
   described in [RFC4761] section 3.4, the Flow label should never be
   handled by the ASBRs, only the terminating PEs on each AS will be
   responsible for popping or pushing this label.  This is equally
   applicable to Method B [section 3.4.2] of [RFC4761] where ASBRs are
   responsible for swapping the PW label as traffic traverses from ASBR
   to PE and ASBR to ASBR directions.  Therefore, the Flow label will
   remain untouched across AS boundaries.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Modifications to Layer 2 Info Extended Community

   The Layer 2 Info Extended Community is used to signal control
   information about the pseudowires to be setup.  The extended
   community format is described in [RFC4761].  The format of this
   extended community is described as:

         S   Defined in [RFC4761].

         C   Defined in [RFC4761].

         R   When the bit value is 1, the PE is able to receive a
             Pseudowire packet with a flow label present. When the bit
             value is 0, the PE is unable to receive a Pseudowire packet
             with the flow label present.

         T   When the bit value is 1, the PE is requesting the ability
             to send a Pseudowire packet that includes a flow label.
             When the bit value is 0, the PE is indicating that it will
             not send a Pseudowire packet containing a flow label.


3.  Signaling the Presence of the Flow Label

   As part of the Pseudowire signaling procedures described in
   [RFC4761], a Layer 2 Info Extended Community is advertised in the
   VPLS BGP NLRI.  This draft recommends that the Control Flags field of
   this extended community be used to synchronize the flow label states
   amongst PEs for a given L2VPN.

   A PE that wishes to send a flow label in a Pseudowire packet MUST
   include in its VPLS BGP NLRI a Layer 2 Info Extended Community using
   Control Flags field with T = 1.

   A PE that is willing to receive a flow label in a Pseudowire packet
   MUST include in its VPLS BGP NLRI a Layer 2 Info Extended Community
   using Control Flags field with R = 1.

   A PE that receives a VPLS BGP NLRI containing a Layer 2 Info Extended
   Community with R = 0 NUST NOT include a flow label in the Pseudowire
   packet.

   Therefore, a PE sending a Control Flags field with T = 1 and
   receiving a Control Flags field with R = 1 MUST include a flow label
   in the Pseudowire packet.  Under all other combinations, a PE MUST
   NOT include a flow label in the Pseudowire packet.

   The signaling procedures in [RFC4761] state that the unspecified bits
   in the Control Flags field (bits 0-5) MUST be set to zero when
   sending and MUST be ignored when receiving.  The signaling procedure
   described here is therefore backwards compatible with existing
   implementations.  A PE not supporting the extensions described in
   this draft will always sent a value of ZERO in the position assigned
   by this draft to the R bit and therefore, flow labels will never be
   inserted by its remote peers.

   Note that what is signaled is the desire to include the flow LSE in
   the label stack.  The value of the flow label is a local matter for
   the ingress PE, and the label value itself is not signaled.
