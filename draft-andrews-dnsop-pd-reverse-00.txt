1.  Introduction

   This document describes a method to automate the delegation of
   IPv6.ARPA reverse zones when performing Prefix Delegations.

   This will allow home users and small businesses to have IPv6.ARPA
   zones without manual intervention on the part of the ISP.


2.  Method

   CPE generates a RSA key pair and stores this in non-volatile memory.

   CPE generates DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation [RFC3633] request which
   includes a KEY-RDATA option (code point TBA) which contains a the
   rdata of a DNS KEY record containing a RSASHA256 key using the public
   components of the previously generated RSA key pair.

   DHCP server updates DNS server based on the prefix it is delegating
   and the KEY-RDATA using TSIG [RFC2845] for authentication and
   responds with prefix.  If this is a new prefix delegation it will
   clear out all the old DNS records as part of the delegation processs.
   If there are multiple prefixes being delegated the ISP's DNS server
   will be updated for all of them.

   The CPE device configures the nameserver built in to it to server the
   reverse of the delegated prefixes.  Alternatively it may configure
   other nameservers to server these zones however the method to do that
   is out of scope for this document.

   CPE device generates DNS UPDATE [RFC2136] which delegates the reverse
   name space to itself and others if they have been configured.  The
   CPE uses SIG(0) [RFC2931] to sign the request with owner name
   matching the reverse of the delegated prefix.

   The ISP's DNS server is configured to accept self signed requests
   (the owner name used in the SIG(0) signature matches the owner name
   of the data to be updated).  It examines the request.  Looks at the
   KEY record added by the DHCPv6 server and decides the request is
   valid.


3.  IANA Considerations

   Allocate a DHCPv6 code point for KEY-RDATA.

4.  Security Considerations

   The UPDATE requests are all signed.  This is a proven method for
   securing UPDATE requests in the DNS.

   As a RSA key is being used there is no issue with the key material
   being in the clear.

   Only the CPE device and the ISP itself is capable of creating,
   updating or destroying the delegation.
