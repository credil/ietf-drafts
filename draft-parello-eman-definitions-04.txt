     1. Introduction 

        Within Energy Management there are terms that may 
        seem obvious to a casual reader but in fact require a

        rigorous and sourced definition.  To avoid any 
        confusion in terms among the working group drafts, 
        one glossary / lexicon of terms should exist that all 
        drafts can refer to. This will avoid a review of 
        terms multiplied across drafts.  
         
        This draft will contain a glossary of definitions of 
        terms that can be agreed upon by the working group 
        outside of the context of drafts and then included in 
        or sourced to this draft. 
         
        Each term will contain a definition(s), a normative 
        or informative reference, an optional example, an 
        optional comment(s) listed a note(s).  
         
        All terms should be rooted with a well-known 
        reference. If a definition is taken verbatim from a 
        reference then the source is listed in square 
        brackets. If a definition is derived from a well-
        known reference then the source is listed as "Adapted 
        from" with the reference listed in square brackets. 
        If a defined term is newly defined here the reference 
        will indicate as such by stating "herein" and if 
        applicable list any composing terms from this 
        document.  
      
        When applicable the [IEEE100] was used as the 
        preferred source. If a term was not available from 
        [IEEE100], then [IEC60050] was used.  When these were 
        multiple items from [IEEE100], [IEC60050] or 
        [ISO50001], there were all included.

     2. Terminology 

      

     Energy Management 

       Energy Management is a set of functions for measuring, 
       modeling, planning, and optimizing networks to ensure 
       that the network elements and attached devices use 
       energy efficiently and is appropriate for the nature 
       of the application and the cost constraints of the 
       organization.  
        
       Reference: Adapted from [ITU-T-M-3400] 
        
       Example: A set of computer systems that will poll 
       electrical meters and store the readings  
        
       NOTES:  
       1. Energy management refers to the activities, methods, 
          procedures and tools that pertain to measuring, 
          modeling, planning, controlling and optimizing the 
          use of energy in networked systems [NMF]. 
        
       2. Energy Management is a management domain which is 
          congruent to any of FCAPS areas of management in the 
          ISO/OSI Network Management Model [TMN]. Energy 
          Management for communication networks and attached 
          devices is a subset or part of an organization's 
          greater Energy Management Policies. 
        
     Energy Management System (EnMS) 

       An Energy Management System is a combination of 
       hardware and software used to administer a network 
       with the primarily purpose being Energy Management. 
        
       Reference: Adapted from [1037C]

     Internet-Draft   <draft-parello-eman-definitions>  Dec 2011 
      
       Example: A single computer system that polls data from 
       devices using SNMP 
        
       NOTES: 
       1. An Energy Management System according to [ISO50001] 
          (ISO-EnMS) is a set of systems or procedures upon 
          which organizations can develop and implement an 
          energy policy, set targets, action plans and take 
          into account legal requirements related to energy 
          use.  An EnMS allows organizations to improve energy 
          performance and demonstrate conformity to 
          requirements, standards, and/or legal requirements.   
        
       2. Example ISO-EnMS:  Company A defines a set of 
          policies and procedures indicating there should 
          exist multiple computerized systems that will poll 
          energy from their meters and pricing / source data 
          from their local utility. Company A specifies that 
          their CFO should collect information and summarize 
          it quarterly to be sent to an accounting firm to 
          produce carbon accounting reporting as required by 
          their local government.  
        
       3. For the purposes of EMAN, the definition from 
          [1037C] is the preferred meaning of an Energy 
          Management System (EnMS).  The definition from 
          [ISO50001] can be referred to as ISO Energy 
          Management System (ISO-EnMS).

     Power 

       The time rate at which energy is emitted, transferred, 
       or received; usually expressed in watts (or in joules 
       per second). 
       Reference: [IEEE100] 
        
     Demand  

       The average value of power or a related quantity over 
       a specified interval of time. Note: Demand is 
       expressed in kilowatts, kilovolt-amperes, kilovars, or 
       other suitable units.

       NOTES: 
       1. typically kilowatts 
        
       2. Energy providers typically bill by Demand 
          measurements as well as for maximum Demand per 
          billing periods.  Power values may spike during 
          short-terms by devices, but Demand measurements 
          recognize that maximum Demand does not equal maximum 
          Power during an interval.

     Proxy Relationship 

        An Energy Object that provides Energy Management 
        capabilities on behalf of another Energy Object is 
        referred to a Proxy Relationship.  
          
        Reference: herein 
         
        Example: a protocol gateways device for Building 
        Management Systems (BMS) with subtended devices. 
         
         
     Dependency Relationship 

        An Energy Object may be a component of or rely 
        completely upon another Energy Object to operate and 
        is referred to as a Dependency Relationship.

     Power State 

        A Power State is a condition or mode of a device that 
        broadly characterizes its capabilities, power 
        consumption, and responsiveness to input. 
         
        Reference: Adapted from [IEEE1621]   
         
        NOTES:  
         
        1. A Power State can be seen as a power setting of an 
          Energy Object that influences the power 
          consumption, the available functionality, and the 
          responsiveness of the Energy Object.   
         
        2. A Power State can be viewed as one method for 
          Energy Control 
         
         
     Power State Set 

        A collection of Power States that comprise one named 
        or logical grouping of control is a Power State Set.   
         
        Reference: herein 
         
        Example: The states {on, off, and sleep} as defined in 
        [IEEE1621], or the 16 power states as defined by the 
        [DMTF] can be considered two different Power State 
        Sets. 
         
         
     Nameplate Power 

        The Nameplate Power is the maximal (nominal) Power 
        that a device can support.  
         
        Reference: herein 
         
        NOTES:  
         
        1. This is typically determined via load testing and 
          is specified by the manufacturer as the maximum 
          value required for operating the device.  This is 
          sometimes referred to as the worst-case Power.  The 
          actual or average Power may be lower.  The

          Nameplate Power is typically used for provisioning 
          and capacity planning.
