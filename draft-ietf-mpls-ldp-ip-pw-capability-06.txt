Abstract 

   Currently, no LDP capability is exchanged for LDP applications like 
   IP Label Switching and L2VPN P2P PW signaling. When an LDP session 
   comes up, an LDP speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state 
   for such LDP applications even when the peer session is established 
   for some other applications like mLDP or ICCP. This document defines 
   a solution by which an LDP speaker announces to its peer its 
   disinterest in such non-negotiated applications. This, in turn, 
   disables the advertisement of corresponding application state, which 
   would have otherwise be advertised by default, over the established 
   LDP session.

Internet-Draft Disabling IPoMPLS and P2P PW App's State Advt June 2013 
 

1. Introduction 

  LDP Capabilities [RFC5561] introduced a mechanism to negotiate LDP 
  capabilities for a given feature between peer LSRs. The capability 
  mechanism insures that no unnecessary state is exchanged between peer 
  LSRs unless the corresponding feature capability is successfully 
  negotiated between the peers.  
   
  While new LDP features and applications, such as Typed Wildcard FEC 
  [RFC5918], Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol [ICCP], mLDP 
  [RFC6388], and L2VPN P2MP PW [P2MP-PW] make use of LDP capabilities 
  framework for their feature negotiation, the earlier LDP features and 
  applications like IP Label Switching and L2VPN P2P PW signaling 
  [RFC4447] [RFC4762] may cause LDP speakers to exchange application 
  state unnecessarily even when the given application is not enabled on 
  one of the LDP speakers participating in a given session. For 
  example, when bringing up and using an LDP peer session with a remote 
  PE LSR for purely ICCP signaling reasons, an LDP speaker may 
  unnecessarily advertise labels for IP (unicast) prefixes to this ICCP 
  related LDP peer.  
   
  Another example of unnecessary state advertisement can be cited when 
  LDP is to be deployed in an IP dual-stack environment. For instance, 
  an LSR that is locally enabled for both IPv4 and IPv6 label switching 
  may advertise label bindings for both IPv4 and IPv6 address families 
  towards an LDP peer that is interested in IPv4 prefix labels only. In 
  this case, the advertisement of IPv6 prefix labels to the peer is 
  unnecessary, as well as wasteful, from the point of view of LSR 
  memory/CPU and network resource consumption.  
   
  To avoid this unnecessary state advertisement and exchange, currently 
  an operator is typically required to configure and define some sort 
  of filtering policies on the LSR, which introduces operational 
  overhead and complexity for such deployments.  
   
  This document defines an LDP Capabilities [RFC5561] based solution by 
  which an LDP speaker may announce to its peer(s) its disinterest (or 
  non-support) for state related to IP Label Switching and/or L2VPN P2P 
  PW Signaling application at the time of session establishment. This 
  helps in avoiding unnecessary state advertisement for such feature 
  applications. The document also states the mechanics to dynamically

Internet-Draft Disabling IPoMPLS and P2P PW App's State Advt June 2013 
 

  disable or enable the state advertisement for such applications 
  during the session lifetime. The non-interesting state of an 
  application depends on the type of application and is described later 
  in section 3.1.   
   
2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].  

   The term "IP" in this document refers to both IPv4 and IPv6 unicast 
   address families. 

   This document uses shorthand terms "IPoMPLS" to refer to IP Label 
   Switching application, and "P2P PW" to refer to L2VPN PW signaling 
   for FEC 128 and FEC 129 P2P Pseudowires.  

3. Non-negotiated LDP applications 

   For the applications that existed prior to the definition of LDP 
   Capabilities framework [RFC5561], an LDP speaker typically 
   advertises, without waiting for any capabilities exchange and 
   negotiation, its corresponding application state to its peers right 
   after the session establishment. These early LDP applications 
   include: 

   o  IPv4/IPv6 Label Switching ("IPoMPLS") 

   o  L2VPN P2P PW signaling ("P2P PW") 

   To disable unnecessary state advertisement for such LDP applications
   over an established LDP session, a new capability is introduced in 
   this document. This new capability controls the advertisement of 
   application state and enables an LDP speaker to notify its peer its 
   disinterest in the state of one or more of these "Non-negotiated" 
   LDP applications at the time of session establishment. Upon receipt 
   of such capability, the receiving LDP speaker, if supporting the 
   capability, disables the advertisement of the state related to the 
   application towards the sender. This new capability can also be sent 
   later in a Capability message to either disable a previously enabled 
   application's state advertisement or to enable a previously disabled 
   application's state advertisement.

3.1. Non-interesting State 

   So far, this document has used the term application "state" to 
   generically refer to some non-interesting state. Now, let us further 
   specify and clarify this term: 

     . A non-interesting state of a non-negotiated application refers 
        to the application state which is of a no interest to an LSR 
        and need not be advertised to the LSR; 
     . This state MUST NOT be advertised in any of the LDP protocol 
        messages; 
     . This state is dependent on application type and specified 
        accordingly. 

   For IPoMPLS application type, the non-interesting state refers to 
   any state related to IP Prefix FEC (such as label bindings, LDP 
   Status). This document, however, does not classify IP address 
   bindings as a non-interesting state and allows the advertisement of 
   IP Address bindings to facilitate other LDP applications (such as 
   mLDP) that depend on learning of peer addresses over an LDP session 
   for their correct operation. 

   For P2P PW application type, the non-interesting state refers to any 
   state related to P2P PW FEC (such as label bindings, MAC [address] 
   withdrawal, and LDP PW Status). 

   From now onward in this document, the term "state" will mean to 
   refer to the "non-interesting state" for an application, as defined 
   in this section. 

4. Controlling State Advertisement for Non-negotiated LDP Applications 

   To control advertisement of non-interesting state related to non-
   negotiated LDP applications, namely IPoMPLS and P2P PW signaling, a 
   new capability TLV is defined as follows. 

4.1. State Advertisement Control Capability 

   The "State Advertisement Control Capability" is a new Capability 
   Parameter TLV defined in accordance with section 3 of LDP 
   Capabilities specification [RFC5561]. The format of this new TLV is 
   as follows:

  Figure 1: Format of an "State Advertisement Control Capability" TLV 
    
   The value of the U-bit for the TLV MUST be set to 1 so that a 
   receiver MUST silently ignore this TLV if unknown to it, and 
   continue processing the rest of the message. Whereas, The value of 
   F-bit MUST be set to 0. Once advertised, this capability cannot be 
   withdrawn; thus S-bit MUST be set to 1 both in an Initialization and 
   Capability message.  
    
   The capability data associated with this State Advertisement Control 
   (SAC) Capability TLV is one or more State Advertisement Control 
   (SAC) Elements, where each element indicates enabling/disabling of 
   advertisement of non-interesting state for a given application. The 
   format of a SAC Element is defined as follows: 
 
                        0                   1

   D bit: Controls the advertisement of the state:

      When sent in an Initialization message, D bit MUST be set to 1. 
    
   Rsvd1, Rsvd2: Reserved for future use. MBZ on transmit and ignored 
    on receipt. 
 
   The "Length" field of SAC Capability TLV depends on the number of 
   SAC Elements present in the TLV. For example, if there are two 
   elements present, then the Length field is set to 5 octets. A 
   receiver of this capability TLV can deduce number of elements 
   present in the TLV by using the Length field.  
    
   From now onward, this document uses the term "element" to refer to a 
   SAC Element. 
     
   As described earlier, SAC Capability TLV MAY be included by an LDP 
   speaker in an Initialization message to signal to its peer LSR that 
   state advertisement for one or more application(s) need to be 
   disabled on the given peer session. This TLV can also be sent later 
   in a Capability message to selectively enable or disable these 
   applications. A SAC Capability TLV MUST contain elements with 
   distinct state types and the TLV MUST NOT contain the same state 
   type more than once. If a receiver receives such a malformed TLV, it 
   SHOULD discard this TLV and continue processing rest of the message. 

   To control more than one application state, a sender LSR can either 
   send a single capability TLV in a message with multiple elements 
   present, or can send separate messages with capability TLV 
   specifying one or more elements. A receiving LSR, however, MUST 
   treat each incoming capability TLV for a given application state 
   type as an update to its existing policy for the given type.  

   To understand capability updates from an example, let us consider 2 
   LSRs, S (LDP speaker) and P (LDP peer), both of which support all 
   the non-negotiated applications listed earlier. By default, these 
   LSR will advertise state for these applications, as configured, to 
   their peer as soon as an LDP session is established. Now assume that 
   P receives from S a SAC capability in the Initialization message 
   with "IPv6 Label switching" and "P2P PW FEC129" states disabled. 
   This updates P's outbound policy towards S to advertise state 
   related to only "IPv4 Label switching" and "P2P PW FEC 128" 
   applications.  Later, P receives another capability update from S 
   via a Capability message with "IPv6 Label switching" enabled and 
   "P2P PW FEC128" disabled. This results in P's outbound policy 
   towards S to advertise both IPv4 and IPv6 Label switching state, and

Internet-Draft Disabling IPoMPLS and P2P PW App's State Advt June 2013 
 

   disable both P2P PW FEC128 and FEC 129 signaling. Finally, P 
   receives another update from S via a Capability message that 
   specifies to disable all four non-negotiated applications state, 
   resulting in P outbound policy towards S to block/disable state for 
   all these applications, and only advertise state for any other 
   application, as applicable. 

5. Capabilities Procedures 

   The SAC capability conveys the desire of an LSR to disable the 
   receipt of unwanted/unnecessary state from its LDP peer. This 
   capability is uni-lateral and uni-directional in nature, and a 
   receiving LSR is not required to send a similar capability TLV in an 
   Initialization or Capability message towards the sender of this 
   capability. This unilateral behavior conforms to the procedures 
   defined in the Section 6 of LDP Capabilities [RFC5561]. 

   After this capability is successfully negotiated (i.e. sent by an 
   LSR and received/understood by its peer), then the receiving LSR 
   MUST NOT advertise any state related to the disabled applications 
   towards the capability sending LSR until and unless these 
   application states are explicitly enabled again via a capability 
   update. Upon receipt of a capability update to disable an enabled 
   application [state] during the lifetime of a session, the receiving 
   LSR MUST also withdraw from the peer any previously advertised state 
   (corresponding to the disabled application). 

   If a receiving LDP speaker does not understand the SAC capability 
   TLV, then it MUST respond to the sender with "Unsupported TLV" 
   notification as described in LDP Capabilities [RFC5561]. If a 
   receiving LDP speaker does not understand or does not support an 
   application specified in an application control element, it SHOULD 
   silently ignore/skip such an element and continue processing rest of 
   the TLV. 

5.1. State Control Capability in an Initialization message 

   LDP Capabilities [RFC5561] framework dictates that the S-bit of 
   capability parameter in an Initialization message MUST be set to 1 
   and SHOULD be ignored on receipt.   

   An LDP speaker determines (e.g. via some local configuration or 
   default policy) if it needs to disable IPoMPLS and/or P2P PW 
   applications with a peer LSR. If there is a need to disable, then 
   the SAC TLV needs to be included in the Initialization message with 
   respective SAC elements included with their D bit set to 1.

Internet-Draft Disabling IPoMPLS and P2P PW App's State Advt June 2013 
 

   An LDP speaker that supports the SAC capability MUST interpret the 
   capability TLV in a received Initialization message such that it 
   disables the advertisement of the application state towards the 
   capability sending LSR for IPoMPLS and/or P2P PW applications if 
   their SAC element's D bit is set to 1.  

5.2. State Control capability in a Capability message 

   If the LDP peer supports "Dynamic Announcement Capability" 
   [RFC5561], then an LDP speaker may send SAC capability in a 
   Capability message towards the peer. Once advertised, these 
   capabilities cannot be withdrawn and hence the S-bit of the TLV MUST 
   be set to 1 when sent in a Capability message.  

   An LDP speaker may decide to send this TLV towards an LDP peer if 
   one or more of its IPoMPLS and/or P2P PW signaling applications get 
   disabled, or if previously disabled application gets enabled again. 
   In this case, the LDP speaker constructs the TLV with appropriate 
   SAC element(s) and sends the corresponding capability TLV in a 
   Capability message.  

   Upon receipt of this TLV in a Capability message, the receiving LDP 
   speaker reacts in the same manner as it reacts upon the receipt of 
   this TLV in an Initialization message. Additionally, the peer 
   withdraws/advertises the application state from/to the capability 
   sending LDP speaker according to the capability update.  

6. Operational Examples 

6.1. Disabling IPoMPLS and P2P PW applications on an ICCP session 

   Consider two PE routers, LSR1 and LSR2, which understand/support SAC 
   capability TLV, and have an established LDP session to exchange ICCP 
   state related to dual-homed devices connected to these LSRs. Let us 
   assume that both LSRs are provisioned not to exchange any state for 
   IPoMPLS (IPv4/IPv6) and P2P PW (FEC128/129) application. 

   To indicate their disinterest in these applications, the LSRs will 
   include a SAC capability TLV (with 4 SAC elements corresponding to 
   these 4 applications with D bit set to 1 for each one) in the 
   Initialization message. Upon receipt of this TLV in Initialization 
   message, the receiving LSR will disable the advertisement of 
   IPv4/IPv6 label bindings, as well as P2P PW FEC128/129 signaling, 
   towards its peer after session establishment.

6.2. Disabling IPoMPLS application on a L2VPN/PW T-LDP session 

   Now, consider LSR1 and LSR2 have an established T-LDP session for 
   P2P PW application to exchange label bindings for FEC 128/129. Given 
   that there is no need to exchange IP (v4/v6) label bindings between 
   the PE LSRs over a PW T-LDP session in most typical deployments, let 
   us assume that LSRs are provisioned to disable IPoMPLS (IPv4/IPv6) 
   application state on given PW session.  

   To indicate their disinterest in IPoMPLS application over a PW T-LDP 
   session, the LSRs will follow/apply the same procedures to disable 
   IPv4 and IPv6 label switching as described in previous section. As a 
   result, only P2P PW related state will be exchanged between these 
   LSRs over this T-LDP session. 

6.3. Disabling IPoMPLS application dynamically on an established IP/PW 
     LDP session 

   Assume that LSRs from previous sections were initially provisioned 
   to exchange both IPoMPLS and P2P PW state over the session between 
   them, and also support "Dynamic Announcement" Capability [RFC5561]. 
   Now, assume that LSR1 is dynamically provisioned to disable IPoMPLS 
   (IPv4/IPv6) over T-LDP session with LSR2. In this case, LSR1 will 
   send SAC capability TLV in a Capability message towards LSR2 with 
   application control elements defined for IPv4 and IPv6 label 
   switching with D bit set to 1. Upon receipt of this TLV, LSR2 will 
   disable IPoMPLS application state(s) towards LSR1 and withdraw all 
   previous application state from LSR1. To withdraw label bindings 
   from its peer, LSR2 MAY use a single Prefix FEC Typed Wildcard Label 
   Withdraw message [RFC5918].  

   This dynamic disability of IPoMPLS application does not impact L2VPN 
   P2P PW application on the given session, and both LSRs should 
   continue to exchange PW Signaling application related state. 

6.4. Disabling IPoMPLS application on an mLDP-only session 

   Now assume that LSR1 and LSR2 have formed an LDP session to exchange 
   mLDP application state only. In typical deployments, LSR1 and LSR2 
   also exchange label bindings for IP prefixes over an mLDP session, 
   which is unnecessary and wasteful for an mLDP-only LSR.  

   Using the procedures defined earlier, an LSR can indicate its 
   disinterest in IPoMPLS application state to its peer upon session 
   establishment time or dynamically later via LDP capabilities update.

   Reference to section 3.1, the peer disables the advertisement of any 
   state related to IP Prefix FECs, but still advertises IP address 
   bindings that are required for the correct operation of mLDP.    

6.5. Disabling unwanted IP state advertisement by an IP dual-stack LSR 

   In IP dual-stack scenarios, an LSR2 may advertise unnecessary state 
   (e.g. IPv6 prefix label bindings) towards peer LSR1 corresponding to 
   IPv6 label switching application once a session is established 
   mainly for exchanging state for IPv4. The similar scenario also 
   applies when advertising IPv4 label switching state on a session 
   meant for IPv6. The SAC capability and its procedures defined in 
   this document can help to avoid such unnecessary state 
   advertisement. 

   Consider IP dual-stack environment where LSR2 is enabled for IPoMPLS 
   application for both IPv4 and IPv6, but LSR1 is enabled for (or 
   interested in) only IPv4oMPLS Label switching. To avoid receiving 
   unwanted state advertisement for IPv6oMPLS Label switching 
   application from LSR2, LSR1 can send SAC capability with element for 
   IPv6 label switching with D bit set to 1 in the Initialization 
   message towards LSR2 at the time of session establishment. Upon 
   receipt of this capability, LSR2 will disable all IPv6 label binding 
   advertisement towards LSR1. If IPv6oMPLS Label switching application 
   is later enabled on LSR1, LSR1 can update the capability by sending 
   SAC capability in a Capability message towards LSR2 to enable 
   IPv6oMPLS Label switching application dynamically. 

7. Security Considerations 

  The proposal introduced in this document does not introduce any new 
  security considerations beyond that already apply to the base LDP 
  specification [RFC5036] and [RFC5920]. 
   
8. IANA Considerations

     This document defines a new LDP capability parameter TLV. IANA is
     requested to assign the lowest available value after 0x0500 from
     "TLV Type Name Space" in the "Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
     Parameters" registry as the new code point for the new LDP 
     capability TLV code point.
