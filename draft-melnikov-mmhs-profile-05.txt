           Military Message Handling System (MMHS) over SMTP
                     draft-melnikov-mmhs-profile-05

Abstract

   A Military Message Handling System (MMHS) processes formal messages
   ensuring release, distribution, security, and timely delivery across
   national and international strategic and tactical networks.  The MMHS
   Elements of Service are defined as a set of extensions to the ITU-T
   X.400 (1992) international standards and are specified in STANAG 4406
   Edition 2 or ACP 123.  This document specifies how a comparable
   messaging service can be provided using SMTP and its extensions.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   A Military Message Handling System (MMHS) processes formal messages
   ensuring release, distribution, security, and timely delivery across
   national and international strategic and tactical networks.  The MMHS
   Elements of Service are defined as a set of extensions to the ITU-T
   X.400 (1992) international standards and are specified in STANAG 4406
   Edition 2 or [ACP123].  This document specifies an MMHS Profile for
   how a comparable messaging service can be provided using Email
   Message Format [RFC5322], SMTP [RFC5321] and their extensions.

1.2.  MMHS Profile Summary

   This non-normative section provides a summary of the sections in this
   document that specifies the MMHS Profile; refer to the sections that
   follow for a normative specification of the MMHS Profile.

Internet-Draft               MMHS over SMTP                 October 2013


   The fundamental purpose of STANAG 4406 Edition 2 or [ACP123] is to
   define a common message service to be provided between all
   participating organisations (or domains).  STANAG 4406 Edition 2 and
   [ACP123] achieve this by defining the Military Messaging Elements of
   Service (EoS) that are required to be supported.  [ACP123] defines
   EoS as 'abstractions that describe features of a system for which the
   user of that system has direct access'.  Note for the purposes of
   this MMHS Profile a 'user' can be described as: an end user; an
   organisation (or domain); a Mail User Agent (MUA); a Mail Submission
   Agent (MSA); or, a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA).

   The MMHS Profile adopts the EoS defined in [ACP123].

   Section 3 provides a developer-friendly summary (Section 3.2) and a
   detailed definition (Section 3.3, Section 3.4 and Section 3.5) that
   specifies:

   o  the mandatory and optional EoS to be supported in order to claim
      conformance to this MMHS Profile; and,

   o  the relevant IETF RFC Standard that provides the comparable EoS.

   Section 4 describes generic security services independent of the
   mechanisms used to provide the security (Section 4.1) and profiles
   the use of Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)
   protocols ([RFC5751], [RFC5652] and [RFC2634]) and DomainKeys
   Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures ([RFC6376]) for implementing these
   security services (Section 4.2).

   In order to implement an MMHS a number of components are typically
   deployed to support [ACP123].  The MMHS profile (defined in this
   document) identifies the requirements on the following SMTP MMHS
   components in order to claim conformance with the EoS specified in
   Section 3 and the security services specified in Section 4 (Note:
   additional SMTP extensions that provide additional SMTP functionality
   but do not have equivalent [ACP123] EoS are also included in these
   sections):

   o  Mail User Agent (Section 5);

   o  Mail Submission Agent (Section 6); and,

   o  Mail Transfer Agent (Section 7);

3.  Elements of Service

3.1.  Introduction

   The military messaging elements of service are adopted from [ACP123].

   Many of these elements of service are derived from the X.400
   standards upon which [ACP123] is based.

   Note that some of the X.400 elements of service do not have an
   equivalent in a SMTP messaging system.  It is not the intention of
   this profile to define additional SMTP functionality and consequently
   a number of the military messaging elements of service are not
   supported by this profile.

   Specifically, the physical delivery, conversion (implicit or
   explicit) and alternate recipient elements of service are not
   supported by this profile.

   This profile adopts, where appropriate, header fields that are
   defined in [RFC2156] to support X.400 elements of service that
   support military messaging elements of service.  [RFC2156] has
   already addressed the issue of conveying many of the X.400 elements
   of service within an SMTP messaging system.

3.3.  Basic Elements of Service

3.3.1.  Access Management

   This element of service enables an Mail User Agent and an Mail
   Transfer Agent to establish access and manage information associated
   with access establishment.  This includes the ability to identify and
   validate the identity of the other.

   Strong authentication in the bind operation is mandatory.  Strong
   authentication MUST be supported using SMTP Extension for
   Authentication [RFC4954] and SMTP Extension for Secure SMTP over TLS
   [RFC3207].

3.3.2.  Content Type Indication

   This element of service enables an originating Mail User Agent to
   indicate the type of each submitted message.  In most cases, the
   content type will be obvious from the header fields that are present.

   A Military Message MUST be indicated using the MMHS-Extended-
   Authorization-Info header field defined in [RFC6477].

Internet-Draft               MMHS over SMTP                 October 2013


3.3.3.  Converted Indication

   This element of service indicates to each recipient UA (i.e., on per-
   recipient basis) that the performed conversion on the Encoded
   Information Types (EITs) within a delivered message.

   Security requirements and mechanisms may not allow conversion to take
   place within the MMHS.

   However, messages entering the MMHS from a gateway (e.g., a civilian
   X.400 domain, an ACP 127 tactical gateway) may carry the converted
   indication.

   The Converted Indication, if present, MUST use the X400-Received
   header field as defined in [RFC2156].

3.3.4.  Delivery Time Stamp Indication

   This element of service indicates to each recipient Mail User Agent
   (i.e., on a per-recipient basis), the date and time at which the Mail
   Transfer Agent delivered a message.

   The delivery time stamp MUST be determined from the first Received
   header field, defined in [RFC5322], present in the message.

3.3.5.  MM Identification

   This element of service enables cooperating Mail User Agents to
   convey a globally unique identifier for each Military Message sent or
   received.  This identifier is used in subsequent messages to identify
   the original Military Message.

   A Military Message MUST be uniquely identified using the Message-ID
   header field defined in [RFC5322].

3.3.6.  Message Identification

   This element of service is used by Mail User Agents and the Mail
   Transfer Agents to refer to a previously submitted message in
   connection with other elements of service such as delivery and non-
   delivery notification.

   Message Identification MUST be specified by the Mail User Agent using
   the ENVID parameter, as defined in [RFC3461].  The Mail Transfer
   Agent MUST return the message identification in the Original-
   Envelope-Id field of a message/delivery status as defined in
   [RFC3461].

3.3.7.  Non-delivery Notification

   This element of service allows a Mail User Agent to ask for the MTS
   to notify the originator if a submitted message was not delivered to
   the specified recipient Mail User Agent.  The MMHS must, with a high
   degree of certainty, deliver a message to the intended recipient(s).
   If the system cannot deliver a message within a determined period of
   time , a non-delivery report will be returned to the originating Mail
   User Agent by the MMHS.  The non-delivery report contains information
   to enable it to be mapped to the appropriate message (i.e., the
   message identification), recipient information, as well as
   information about why the message could not be delivered.

   Non-Delivery notifications MUST be generated in accordance with
   [RFC3461].

   Note that non-delivery notifications are requested on a per message
   basis in this profile, and not on a per recipient basis as defined in
   [ACP123].

3.3.8.  Original Encoded Information Types

   This element of service enables the originating Mail User Agent to
   indicate the various formats of the bodyparts of a message.

   The Original Encoded Information Types, if present, MUST use the
   Original-Encoded-Information-Types header field as defined in
   [RFC2156].

3.3.9.  Submission Time Stamp Indication

   This element of service enables the Message Transfer Agent to
   indicate to the originating Mail User Agent and each recipient Mail
   User Agent the date and time at which is which was submitted to the
   Message Transfer Agent.

   The Submission Time Stamp Indication MUST use the determined from the
   last Received header field, as defined in [RFC5322], present in the
   message.  Note that this is distinct from the Date header field,
   defined in [RFC5322], which is more likely to be displayed by a
   receiving Mail User Agent but which indicates the date and time at
   which the originator of the message indicated that the message was
   complete and ready to submitted.

3.3.10.  Typed Body

Internet-Draft               MMHS over SMTP                 October 2013


   This element of service allows the nature and attributes of the body
   of the message, whereby the nature and attributes describe the body
   of the message, to be conveyed along with the body.

   The MMHS MUST support this element of service whereby:

   o  A Mail User Agent MUST support Multipurpose Internet Mail
      Extensions (MIME) [RFC2045], [RFC2046], [RFC2047] and [RFC2049];
      and,

   o  A Mail Submission Agent MUST support SMTP Extension for 8-bit MIME
      transport [RFC6152].

3.3.11.  User/UA Capabilities Registration

   This element of service enables a MUA to indicate to the MMHS
   unrestricted use of any or all of the following capabilities with
   respect to received messages:

   o  the content type(s) of messages it is willing to accept;

   o  the maximum content length of a message it is willing to accept;
      and

   o  the Encoded Information Type(s) of messages it is willing to
      accept.

   There is no current SMTP service that supports this element of
   service.  Therefore this profile does not support this element of
   service.

   However, this element of service MAY be supported by an MUA that
   supports Internet Message Access Protocol ([RFC3501]) or by MUAs and
   other MMHS components that provide proprietary mechanisms (i.e
   Directory Services).

3.4.  Optional Elements of Service

3.4.1.  Alternate Recipient Allowed

   This element of service enables an originating Mail User Agent to
   specify that the message being submiited can be redirected to an
   alternate recipient.  Unless an originator specifically request that
   an alternate recipient be disallowed, all Military Messages will
   indicate that an alternate recipient is allowed.

   There is no current SMTP service that supports allows the originator
   to disallow the redirection of a message to an alternate recipient.

Internet-Draft               MMHS over SMTP                 October 2013


   Therefore this profile does not support the Alternate Recipient
   Allowed element of service.  [[ We could refer to MIXER field to
   allow control within X.400 domains, even though not supported within
   SMTP domains?]]

3.4.2.  Alternate Recipient Assignment

   This element of service enables a receiving Mail User Agent to be
   given the capability to have certain messages delivered to it for
   which there is not an exact match between the recipient address
   specified in the message and the valid addresses within the recipient
   domain.  This service allows a message that would otherwise be
   undeliverable to be delivered to a "default mailbox" within the
   recipient domain.

   There is no current SMTP service that supports allows the Alternate
   Recipient Assignment element of service.  Therefore this profile does
   not support the Alternate Recipient Assignment element of service.
   Note that some Mail Transfer Agent products may provide propriertary
   mechanisms that support the element of service.

3.4.3.  Authorizing Users Indication

   This element of service allows the originator to indicate to the
   recipient the names or one or more persons who authorized the sending
   of the messages.

   The Authorizing Users Indication element of service MUST be
   conformant with the Draft and Release using Internet Email
   specification [I-D.melnikov-mmhs-authorizing-users].  In addition,
   the Sender header field as defined in [RFC5322] (carrying the
   Originator Indication) MUST also be present in accordance with
   [RFC2156].

3.4.4.  Auto-forwarded Indication

   This element of service allows a recipient to determine that the body
   of an incoming Military Message contains a Military Message that has
   been auto-forwarded by an autonomous Mail Submission Agent.  This is
   used to distinguish the incoming Military Message that contains a
   Military Message that was manually forwarded by the original
   recipient.  If automatic forwarding of Military Messages is supported
   by a Mail Submission Agent, then the Auto-forwarded Indication MUST
   be supported on origination.

   The Auto-forwared Indication MUST use the Autoforwarded header field,
   as defined in [RFC2156].

Internet-Draft               MMHS over SMTP                 October 2013


3.4.5.  Blind Copy Recipient Indication

   This element of service enable the originator to provide the address
   of one or more additional intended recipients of the message being
   sent.  These names are not disclosed to the primary, copy or other
   blind copy recipients.  This service can be used to keep some
   recipient names and addressed hidden from other recipients.  This
   service can be used to send a courtesy copy to drafters or reviewers
   of a message, when internal information, such as who drafted or
   reviewed the message, is not to be disclosed to the recipient(s).
   Separate copies of the mesage MUST be submitted to the Mail Transfer
   Agent for the open recipients (primary and copy recipients) and for
   each blind copy recipient.  The messages sent to each of blind copy
   recipients MUST contain same MM Identification as the message sent to
   the open recipients.

   The Blind Copy Recipient Indication MUST use the Bcc header field, as
   defined in [RFC5322].

3.4.6.  Body Part Encryption Indication

   This element of service allows the originator to indicate to the
   recipient that a particular body of the message has been sent
   encrypted.

   There is no current SMTP service that supports allows the Body Part
   Encryption Indication element of service.  Therefore this profile
   does not support the Body Part Encryption Indication element of
   service.  [[Refer to whole message encryption options]].

3.4.7.  Conversion Prohibited

   This element of service enables an originating Mail User Agent to
   instruct the Mail Transfer Agent that the implicit conversion of the
   military message should not be performed.

   This element of service is not supported by an SMTP Mail Transfer
   Agent.  A Mail User Agent MAY use the Conversion header field, as
   defined in [RFC2156] to control the conversion to an X.400 message at
   a MIXER gateway and further within the X.400 domain at X.400 Mail
   Transfer Agents.

3.4.8.  Conversion Prohibition in Case of Loss of Information

   This element of service enables and originating Mail User Agent to
   instruct the Mail Transfer Agent that the implicit conversion of the
   military message should not be performed, if such conversion would
   result in the loss of information.

Internet-Draft               MMHS over SMTP                 October 2013


   This element of service is not supported by an SMTP Mail Transfer
   Agent.  A Mail User Agent MAY use the Conversion-With-Loss header
   field, as defined in [RFC2156] to control the conversion to an X.400
   message at a MIXER gateway and further within the X.400 domain at
   X.400 Mail Transfer Agents.

3.4.9.  Cross Referencing Indication

   This element of service allows the originator to associate the
   globally unique identifiers of one or more other messages with the
   message being sent.  This enables the recipient's Mail User Agent,
   for example, to retrieve a copy of the referenced messages.

   The Cross Referencing Indication MUST use the References header
   field, as defined in [RFC5322].

3.4.10.  Deferred Delivery

   This element of service enables an originating Mail User Agent to
   instruct the Mail Transfer Agent that a military message being
   submitted shall be delivered no sooner than a specified date and
   time.  When tis service is requested, it MUST be logged for audit and
   tracing purposes.

   Deferred Delivery MUST be specified in accordance with [RFC4865]

3.4.11.  Deferred Delivery Cancellation

   This element of service enables an orginating MUA to instruct the MTA
   to cancel a previously submitted military message that contained a
   Deferred Delivery date and time.

   Deferred Delivery Cancellation is not supported by this profile.

3.4.12.  Delivery Notification

   This element of service enables the originating MUA to request that
   the originating MUA be explicitly notified when a submitted military
   message has been successfully delivered to a recipient MUA.  This
   notification is convered by a delivery report.  The delivery report
   is related to the submitted mesages by means of a message identifier
   and includes the date and time of delivery.  Receipt of a delivery
   report at the originating MUA results in the the generation of a
   delivery notification to the originator.  In the case of multi-
   destination military messages, this service shall be selectable on a
   per recipient basis.

   message basis.

3.4.13.  Designation of Recipient by Directory Name

   This element of service enables an originating UA to use, on a per-
   recipient basis, a directory name in place of an individual
   recipient's address.  This implies the support of a directory
   service.  The directory name must be translated to an email address
   for delivery to take place.  However, the directory lookup may take
   place at the MTA rather than at the MUA.

   Designation of Recipient by Directory Name is not suppoted by this
   profile.

   However the designation of a recipient by a directory name MAY be
   supported by a MUA that can retrieve an address from a directory
   service.

3.4.14.  Disclosure of Other Recipients

   This element of service enables the originating MTA to instruct the
   MTS to disclose the address of all oter recipient of a multi-
   recipient military message to each recipient MUA, upon delivery of
   the message.  The addresses disclosed are as supplied by the
   originating MUA or the results of address list expansion.

   Disclosure of Other Recipients is not supported by this profile.

3.4.15.  DL Expansion History Indication

   This element of service provides information to a recipient about the
   DL(s) that resulted in the message being delivered to this recipient.
   This element of service also provides a mechanism to protect against
   potential nested DL looping.

   [[What are we going to do here?]]

   The DL-Expansion-History header defined in [RFC2156] SHALL NOT be
   used.  DL-Expansion-History header MAY be present in messages
   gatewayed from X.400.

Internet-Draft               MMHS over SMTP                 October 2013


3.4.16.  DL Expansion Prohibited

   This element of service allows an originating user to specify that if
   any of the recipient names can directly, or be reassignment, refer to
   a distribution, then no expansion of the distribution shall occur.
   Instead, a non-delivery notification shall be returned to the
   originating Mail User Agent.

   [[What are we going to do here?]]

3.4.17.  Expiry Date Indication

   This element of service allows the originator to indicate to the
   recipient the date and time after which the message is considered
   invalid.  The intent of this element of service is to state the
   originator's assessment of the current applicability of a message.
   If the Expiry Date Indication is present, it shall be displayed to
   the recipients(s) to indicate the time after which this message
   should be longer be acted upon.  It is left to the discretion of the
   recipient as to whether or not the message is discarded.

   The Expiry Date Indication element of service, if supported by the
   MMHS, SHALL use the Expires header field, as defined in [RFC2156]

3.4.18.  Explicit Conversion

   This element of service enables an originating MUA to request, on a
   per-recipient basis, that the MTA perform a specified Encoded
   Information Type conversion.

   Explicit Conversion is not supported by this profile.

3.4.19.  Forwarded MM Indication

   This element of service allows a message, plus its delivery
   information to be sent as a body part inside another message.  In a
   multi-part body the forwarded message may be one of serveral body
   parts of various types.

   The Forwarded MM Indication element of service, if supported by the
   MMHS, SHALL use the Content Type header field, as defined in
   [RFC2045] with the value "message/rfc822" and use the Content Type
   Indication, as defined in Section 3.3.2, within the headers of the
   embedded message.

3.4.20.  Grade of Delivery Selection





Melnikov, et al.         Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft               MMHS over SMTP                 October 2013


   This element of service enables an originating MUA to request that
   transfer through the MMHS take place at a selected priority.  The
   time periods defined for each grade of delivery must be specified in
   an organisation (or domain) policy and bilaterally agreed between
   participating organisations (or domains).

   The Grade of Delivery Selection element of service MUST be supported
   by the MMHS, using the MT-Priority header field, as defined in
   [RFC6758].

   The Grade of Delivery Selection MT-Priority header field value MUST
   be derived from the Primary Precedence (Section 3.5.1) MMHS-Primary-
   Precedence header field value.

   The MMHS message may have no primary recipients (therefore no Primary
   Precedence); the Grade of Delivery Selection MT-Priority header field
   value MUST be derived from the Copy Precedence (Section 3.5.2) MMHS-
   Copy-Precedence header field value.

   The mapping between the Grade of Delivery Selection MT-Priority
   header field values and the Primary Precedence MMHS-Primary-
   Precedence header field values (and subsequently the Copy Precedence
   MMHS-Copy-Precedence header field values) MUST support the
   "STANAG4406" Priority Assignment Policy specified in [RFC6758]
   Appendix A.

   The Grade of Delivery Selection MT-Priority doesn't have to be
   displayed to the recipient by the MUA, as an indication of the Grade
   of Delivery selection element of service is provided to the recipient
   MUA by the Primary and Copy Precedence.

3.4.21.  Hold for Delivery

   This element of service enables a recipient MUA to request that the
   MTA hold its MMHS messages and returning notifications for delivery
   until a later time.  The MUA can indicate to the MTA when it is
   unavailable to take delivery of messages and notifications, and also,
   when it is again ready to accept delivery of messages and
   notifications from the MTA.  The MTA can indicate to the MUA that
   messages are waiting due to the criteria the MUA established for
   holding messages.  The MMHS message will be held until the maximum
   delivery time for that MMHS message expires, unless the recipient
   releases the hold prior to its expiry.

   There is no current SMTP service that supports the Hold for Delivery
   element of service.  Therefore this profile does not support this
   element of service.

Internet-Draft               MMHS over SMTP                 October 2013


   However, this element of service MAY be partially supported by MTA
   products that provide proprietary mechanisms to schedule delivery
   times based on MMHS message size and MMHS message priority.

3.4.22.  Incomplete Copy Indication

   This element of service allows an originator to indicate that this
   MMHS message is an incomplete copy of a MMHS message with the same
   Message-ID header field in that one or more body parts or header
   fields of the original MMHS message are absent.

   The Incomplete Copy Indication element of service MAY be supported by
   the MMHS, using the Incomplete-Copy header field, as defined in
   [RFC2156].

3.4.23.  Language Indication

   This element of service enables an originating MUA to indicate the
   language type(s) of a submitted message.

   The Language Indication element of service MAY be supported by the
   MMHS, using the Content-Language header field, as defined in
   [RFC3282].

3.4.24.  Latest Delivery Designation

   This element of service enables an originating MUA to specify the
   latest time by which the MMHS message is to be delivered.  If the MTA
   cannot deliver by the time specified, the MMHS message is canceled
   and a non-delivery report returned to the originating MUA.

   The Latest Delivery Designation element of service MUST be supported
   by the MMHS as defined in the Deliver By SMTP extension [RFC2852].

3.4.25.  Multi-destination Delivery

   This element of service allows an originating MUA to specify that a
   message being submitted is to be delivered to more than one recipient
   MUA.  This does not imply simultaneous delivery to all specified
   recipient MUAs.

   The Multi-destination Delivery element of service is supported by the
   SMTP RCPT command as defined in [RFC5321].

3.4.26.  Multi-part Body

   This element of service allows an originator to send a message that
   is partitioned into several parts.  The nature and attributes, or

   type, of each body part are conveyed along with the body part.  This
   enables the multiple parts to be of different encoded information
   types.

   The MMHS MUST support this element of service whereby:

   o  A Mail User Agent MUST support Multipurpose Internet Mail
      Extensions (MIME) [RFC2045], [RFC2046], [RFC2047] and [RFC2049];
      and,

   o  A Mail Submission Agent MUST support SMTP Extension for 8-bit MIME
      transport [RFC6152].

3.4.27.  Non-receipt Notification Request Indication

   This element of service allows the originator to ask, on a per-
   recipient basis, for notification if the MMHS message is deemed
   unreceivable by any of the recipients.

   The Non-Receipt Notification Request Indication MUST be supported by
   the MMHS, using the Disposition-Notification-To header field as
   defined in [RFC3798].

   In the case where the Non-Receipt Notification Request Indication
   element of service is required for a subset of the recipients the MSA
   MUST: submit a MMHS message to those recipients that a non-receipt
   notification is requested with a Disposition-Notification-To header
   field; and, submit a MMHS message(s) to those recipients that a non-
   receipt notification is not requested without a Disposition-
   Notification-To header field.

   Note that while this element of service is selectable on a per
   recipient basis, an MUA MAY only allow it to be selected on a per
   message basis.

   Note that this element of service will be supported in conjunction
   with the Receipt Notification Request Indication as profiled in
   Section 3.4.33.

3.4.28.  Obsoleting Indication

   This element of service allows the originator to indicate to the
   recipient that one or more previously sent MMHS messages are
   obsolete.  The intention of this element of service is for the MUA to
   display to the user reading the original MMHS message that the
   original MMHS message is obsolete.  It is the responsibility of the
   user for discarding the original MMHS message.

   The Obsoleting Indication element of service MAY be supported by the
   MMHS, using the Supersedes header field, as defined in [RFC2156].

3.4.29.  Originator Indication

   The Originator Indication MUST use the MMHS-Authorizing-Users header
   field, as defined in [I-D.melnikov-mmhs-authorizing-users], when the
   Authorizing Users Indication is present in the message and the Sender
   header field, as defined in [RFC5322], when the Authorising Users
   Indication is not present in the message.

   This conditional use of different header fields is required to
   support interoperability with [ACP123] and [STANAG-4406] X.400
   systems that utilise a MIXER compliant gateway, [RFC2156].

3.4.30.  Originator Requested Alternate Recipient

   This element of service enables the originating MUA to specify, for
   each intended recipient, one alternate recipient to whom the MTA can
   deliver the message, if delivery to the intended recipient is not
   possible.  This service allows a MMHS message that would otherwise be
   delayed or non-delivered to be delivered to an alternative message
   recipient.

   There is no current SMTP service that supports the Originator
   Requested Alternate Recipient element of service.  Therefore this
   profile does not support this element of service.  Note that some
   MTAs may provide propriertary mechanisms that support this element of
   service.

3.4.31.  Prevention of Non-delivery Notification

   This element of service enables an originating MUA to instruct a MTA
   not to return a non-delivery report to the originating MUA in the
   event that the message being submitted is judged undeliverable.

   This element of service MUST be supported by the MMHS, using the
   NOTIFY parameter of the ESMTP RCPT command with as value of NEVER, as
   defined in [RFC3461].

   Note that while this element of service is selectable on a per
   recipient basis, an MUA MAY only allow it to be selected on a per
   message basis.

3.4.32.  Primary and Copy Recipients Indication

   Primary and Copy recipients, within the MMHS, are known as action and
   information addressees, respectively.  A primary recipient has a

   responsibility to act upon a delivered MMHS message, whereas a Copy
   recipient has been sent the MMHS message for information purposes
   only.

   The Primary and Copy Recipients Indication element of service MUST be
   supported by the MMHS, using the To and Cc header fields,
   respectively, as defined in [RFC5322].

3.4.33.  Receipt Notification Request Indication

   This element of service allows the originator of a MMHS message to
   request, on a per-recipient basis, for notification when a particular
   MMHS message is received.  The recipient MUA MUST prominently display
   the request for this element of service and permit the recipient to
   honour the request or reject the request.

   The Receipt Notification Request Indication MUST be supported by the
   MMHS, using the Disposition-Notification-To header field as defined
   in [RFC3798].

   In the case where the Receipt Notification Request Indication element
   of service is required for a subset of the recipients the MSA MUST:
   submit a MMHS message to those recipients that a receipt notification
   is requested with a Disposition-Notification-To header field; and,
   submit a MMHS message(s) to those recipients that a receipt
   notification is not requested without a Disposition-Notification-To
   header field.

   Note that while this element of service is selectable on a per
   recipient basis, an MUA MAY only allow it to be selected on a per
   message basis.

   Note that this element of service will be supported in conjunction
   with the Receipt Notification Request Indication as profiled in
   Section 3.4.27.

   In the case where the MMHS supports S/MIME security services profiled
   in Section 4 the originating MUA MAY use the Non-repudiation of
   Receipt element of service as specified in Section 4.1.7.

3.4.34.  Redirection Disallowed by Originator

   This element of service enables an originating MUA to instruct the
   MTA that redirection should not be applied to a particular submitted
   MMHS message.

   There is currently no SMTP service that supports this element of
   service.  Therefore, the Redirection Disallowed by Originator element
   of service is not supported by this profile.

3.4.35.  Redirection of Incoming Messages

   This element of service enables a MUA to instruct the MTA to redirect
   incoming MMHS messages addressed to it, to another MUA or to an
   Address List (AL), for a specified period of time, or until revoked.

   There is currently no SMTP service that supports this element of
   service.  Therefore the Redirection of Incoming Messages element of
   service is not supported by this profile.  However, note that some
   MTA products MAY be able to enforce a local security policy
   supporting this element of service with proprietary mechanisms.

3.4.36.  Reply Request Indication

   This element of service allows the originator to request, on a per-
   recipient basis, that a recipient send a message in reply to the MMHS
   message that carries the request.  The originator can also optionally
   specify the date by which any reply should be sent and the names of
   one or more users and ALs who the originator requests be included
   among the preferred recipients of any reply.

   The Reply Request Indication element of service is not supported by
   this profile.

   This element of service MAY be procedurally defined by a MMHS.  Hence
   the Reply Request Indication MAY be supported by including the
   request within the body of the MMHS message.

   Blind Copy recipients of the MMHS message, that includes support for
   this element of service within the message body, SHOULD be careful to
   consider the recipients of the reply MMHS message honoring the Blind
   Copy Recipient Indication element of service profiled in
   Section 3.4.5.

3.4.37.  Replying MM Indication

   This element of service allows the originator of a MMHS message to
   indicate to the recipients that the message is being sent in reply to
   another MMHS message.

   The Replying MM Indication element of service MAY be supported by the
   MMHS, using the In-Reply-To header field as defined in [RFC5322].

   recipient basis, the preference of method or methods of delivery.

   Requested Preferred Delivery Method is not supported by this profile.

3.4.39.  Subject Indication

   This element of service allows the originator to indicate to the
   recipient(s) a user specified short description of the message.

   The Subject Indication element of service MUST be supported by the

3.5.8.  Clear Service

   This element of service indicates to the recipient that the military
   message containing classified information has been transmitted over
   non-secure communications links.  This element of service, if
   permitted by the security policy, MAY be supported by using the
   printable string "CLEAR" in the privacy mark component of the
   security label (see Section 4.1.6) along with an appropriate security
   policy identifier.  If this element of service is supported by the
   MMHS, the MUA MUST prominently display to the user that the military
   message has been transmitted over non-secure communication links.

3.5.9.  Other Recipient Indicator

   The MMHS-Other-Recipients-Indicator-To and MMHS-Other-Recipients-

4.  Security Services

   An MMHS MAY support security services.  The security services
   specified in this profile are based on the Secure Multipurpose
   Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protocols and DomainKeys Identified
   Mail (DKIM) Signatures specified in [RFC6376].  The S/MIME protocols
   Message Specification [RFC5751], Cryptographic Message Syntax
   [RFC5652] and Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME [RFC2634] specify
   a consistent way to securely send and receive MIME messages providing
   end to end integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and
   confidentiality.  DKIM's primary purpose is to define an
   organization-level digital signature authentication framework for

Internet-Draft               MMHS over SMTP                 October 2013


   Internet email, using public key cryptography and using the domain
   name service as its key server technology.  However, it is possible
   to administer DKIM to support user-level signature granularity.  This
   section describes the generic security services and profiles the use
   of [RFC5751], [RFC5652], [RFC2634] and [RFC6376].

4.1.  General Security Elements of Service

   The general security services and implementation requirements for
   providing these security services for an MMHS are detailed below.

4.1.1.  Access Control

   The Access Control security service provides a means of enforcing the
   authorization of users to originate and receive messages.  Access
   controls are performed in each MMHS domain in accordance with the
   security policy in force.  MMHS systems MAY enforce their own native
   security policies, plus any other security policies that have been
   bilaterally agreed.

   An MMHS providing the access control service MUST perform access
   control decisions based on comparing the sensitivity information
   conveyed in a security label (Section 4.1.6) with a user's
   authorizations.

4.1.2.  Authentication of Origin

   The Authentication of Origin security service provides assurance that
   the message was originated by the user indicated as the sender by
   digitally signing the message.  However, it must be noted that the
   implementation of the MMHS security services is dependent upon the
   security and assurance requirements that are to be met by those MMHS
   security services.  As such, the identity of the signer of the MMHS
   message may be the user, the role the user is performing or the
   organization (or domain) the user belongs to.

   If the MMHS provides security services it MUST support the
   Authentication of Origin service.

   The MMHS SHOULD implement this service on origination supporting the
   SignedData content type (profiled in Section 4.2.1.2) to apply a
   digital signature to a MMHS message or, in a degenerate case where
   there is no signature information, to convey certificates.

   Alternatively the MMHS MAY implement this service on origination
   supporting DKIM (profiled in Section 4.2.4) to apply a digital
   signature to a MMHS message.

Internet-Draft               MMHS over SMTP                 October 2013


   On reception the MMHS MUST support S/MIME and DKIM digital
   signatures.

4.1.3.  Non-repudiation of Origin

   The Non-repudiation of Origin security service provides the recipient
   with evidence that demonstrates, to a third-party, who originated the
   message, and will protect against any attempt by the message
   originator to falsely deny having sent the message.  However, it must
   be noted that the implementation of the MMHS security services is
   dependent upon the security and assurance requirements that are to be
   met by those MMHS security services.  As such, the identity of the
   signer of the MMHS message may be the user, the role the user is
   performing or the organization the user belongs to.

   If the MMHS provides security services it MUST support the Non-
   repudiation of Origin service.

   The MMHS SHOULD implement this service on origination as profiled in
   Section 4.2.1.2.

   Alternatively the MMHS MAY implement this service on origination
   supporting DKIM (profiled in Section 4.2.4) to apply a digital
   signature to a MMHS message.

   On reception the MMHS MUST support S/MIME and DKIM digital
   signatures.

4.1.4.  Message Integrity

   The Message Integrity security service provides a method of ensuring
   the content that was received by the recipient(s) is the same as that
   which was sent by the originator.  However, it must be noted that the
   implementation of the MMHS security services is dependent upon the
   security and assurance requirements that are to be met by those MMHS
   security services.  As such, the identity of the signer of the MMHS
   message may be the user, the role the user is performing or the
   organization the user belongs to.

   If the MMHS provides security services it MUST support the Message
   Integrity service.

   The MMHS SHOULD implement this service on origination as profiled in
   Section 4.2.1.2.

   Alternatively the MMHS MAY implement this service on origination
   supporting DKIM (profiled in Section 4.2.4) to apply a digital
   signature to a MMHS message.

Internet-Draft               MMHS over SMTP                 October 2013


   On reception the MMHS MUST support S/MIME and DKIM digital
   signatures.

4.1.5.  Message Data Separation

   The Message Data Separation security service protects against
   unauthorized disclosure of the message, and separates data contained
   in one message from that contained in another message.  This service
   can help to enforce need to know restrictions, or enables multiple
   different user communities to share the same secure network.  The
   service is independent of the network and systems transporting the
   message.

   The MMHS MAY implement this service supporting the EnvelopedData
   content type (profiled in Section 4.2.1.3) to apply privacy
   protection to a message.  A sender needs to have access to a public
   key for each intended message recipient to use this service.  This
   content type does not provide authentication.

4.1.6.  Security Labels

   The Security Label security service provides a method for associating
   security labels with objects in the MMHS.  This then allows a
   security policy to define what entities can handle messages
   containing associated security labels.  The security label associated
   with a message MUST indicate the security policy to be followed along
   with the sensitivity, compartments, and other handling caveats
   associated with the message.  This service can be used for purposes
   such as access control or a source of routing information.

   If the MMHS supports security services then the MMHS MUST implement
   this service as profiled in Section 4.2.5.

4.1.7.  Non-repudiation of Receipt

   The Non-repudiation of Receipt security service provides the
   originator with evidence that demonstrates, to a third-party, who
   received the message, and will protect against any attempt by the
   message recipient to falsely deny having received the message.  This
   evidence is the signed receipt, which includes a digital signature
   and the certificates necessary to verify it.

   The MMHS MAY implement this service supporting the ReceiptRequest
   attribute as specified in [RFC2634] Section 2.

4.1.8.  Secure Mailing Lists

Internet-Draft               MMHS over SMTP                 October 2013


   The Secure Mailing Lists security service allows a Mail List Agent
   (MLA) to take a single message, perform recipient-specific security
   processing, and then redistributes the message to each member of the
   Address List (AL) or Mail List (ML).

   The MMHS MAY implement this service supporting the mlExpansionHistory
   attribute as specified in [RFC2634] Section 4.

4.1.9.  Message Counter Signature

   The Message Counter Signature security service allows multiple
   signatures to be applied to the original signature value in a
   sequential manner.  Thus, the Message Counter-signature service
   allows supervising users or release authorities to countersign for an
   originator without invalidating the original signature.

   The MMHS MAY implement this service supporting the countersignature
   attribute as specified in [RFC5652] Section 11.4.

4.1.10.  Certificate Binding

   The Certificate Binding security service allows for a certificate,
   which is sent with the message to be cryptographically bound to the
   message.

   The MMHS MAY implement this service supporting the SigningCertificate
   attribute as specified in [RFC2634] Section 5.  The
   SigningCertificate attribute SHOULD only contain the leaf end-user
   certificate except where some prior agreement (possibly bilateral)
   exists to ensure that path validation is not adversely affected.
   Differing treatment in [RFC2634] Section 5.3, paragraph 3 avoids
   impact to path validation if only the leaf certificate is included.

4.1.11.  Compressed Data

   The Compressed Data security service reduces message size, which
   helps to protect MMHS availability and may provide an element of
   robustness in the event of denial of service attacks.

   If the MMHS provides security services it MAY support the Compressed
   Data service.

   The MMHS SHOULD include support for the Compressed Data content type
   on origination profiled in Section 4.2.1.4.

   Alternatively the MMHS MAY support the application/zlib and
   application/gzip MIME media types on origination as defined in
   [RFC6713].

   On reception the MMHS MUST support the Compressed Data content type,
   application/zlib media type and application/gzip media type.

4.2.  Security Profile

   This section profiles the use of the S/MIME protocols [RFC5751],
   [RFC5652] and [RFC2634] and DKIM protocol [RFC6376] for adding
   cryptographic services to the MMHS.  The relevant sections of
   [RFC5751], [RFC5652], [RFC2634] and [RFC6376] are listed with further
   clarifications and amendments specific to the implementation of an
   MMHS conformant with this profile.

   This security profile is aligned with the "Profile for the Use of the
   Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) and Enhanced Security Services
   (ESS) for S/MIME", [STANAG-4631].

   In order for participating organisations (or domains) to obtain
   secure interoperability additional bilateral agreements on the
   labeling, cryptographic algorithms and Public Key Infrastructure
   (PKI) needs to be achieved.

4.2.1.  S/MIME Cryptographic Message Syntax Content Types

   If the MMHS supports the S/MIME protocols for implementing the
   security services then the MMHS MUST support the Data, SignedData,
   EnvelopedData, and CompressedData content types as specified in
   [RFC5751].

   In accordance with [RFC5652] ContentInfo MUST be supported to
   encapsulate the outer most SignedData or EnvelopedData content type.
   Conventions for inner wrappers MUST comply with [RFC5751].

   The clarifications and refinements are as follows:

   o  The ContentInfo contentType field MUST be supported.

   o  The ContentInfo content field MUST be supported.

4.2.1.1.  Data Content Type

   The MMHS MUST use the id-data content type identifier to identify the
   "inner" MIME message content as specified in [RFC5751].

4.2.1.2.  Signed-data Content Type

   The signedData content type is specified in [RFC5652] Section 5,
   consisting of MIME content (identified by the id-data content type)
   and zero or more signature values.

4.2.1.2.1.  SignedData Type

   The MMHS MUST support the SignedData type as specified in [RFC5652]
   Section 5.1.  The clarifications and refinements are as follows:

   o  The MMHS MUST support the EncapsulatedContentInfo type
      eContentType attribute.  The value of the eContentType MUST be id-
      data unless the content is compressed according to
      Section 4.2.1.4.

   o  The MMHS MUST support the EncapsulatedContentInfo type eContent
      attribute.  The value of the eContent MUST contain the content to
      be signed.  If the content is compressed using the compressed-data
      content type as defined in Section 4.2.1.4, the
      CompressedData.encapContentInfo.eContentType MUST be set to the
      id-data content type identifier of the compressed MIME content and
      the CompressedData.encapContentInfo.eContent MUST contain the MIME
      content to be compressed and protected by S/MIME.

   o  The MMHS MUST support X.509 version 3 certificates.  An MMHS with
      high throughput MUST include certificates within the message.  An
      MMHS with impoverished communications SHOULD NOT send certificates
      with the message.

   o  The MMHS MUST support the certificate profile and CRL profile
      specified in [RFC5280] [RFC6818].

   o  The MMHS MUST support X.509 version 3 certificate processing
      specified in [RFC5750].

4.2.1.2.2.  SignerInfo Type

   The SignerInfo type is specified in [RFC5652] Section 5.3 allowing
   the inclusion of unsigned and signed attributes along with a
   signature.  The clarifications and refinements are as follows:










Melnikov, et al.         Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 39]

Internet-Draft               MMHS over SMTP                 October 2013


   o  The MMHS MUST support signed attributes.  As a minimum the MMHS
      MUST support processing and handling of the following signed
      attributes: contentType ([RFC5751] Section 2.5.1);
      eSSSecurityLabel ([RFC2634] Section 3.2; messageDigest ([RFC5652]
      Section 11.2); signingTime ([RFC5751] Section 2.5.1);
      sMIMECapabilities ([RFC5751] Section 2.5.2); and,
      sMIMEEncryptionKeyPreference ([RFC5751] Section 2.5.3).

   o  The MMHS MUST support the conventions for using the Secure Hash
      Algorithm (SHA) message digest algorithms and signature algorithms
      as specified in [RFC5754] and [RFC5751].

   o  The MMHS MUST support both the SignerIdentifier type attributes
      issuerAndSerialNumber and subjectKeyIdentifier.

4.2.1.3.  Enveloped-data Content Type

   The envelopedData content type is specified in [RFC5652] Section 6,
   consisting of an encrypted MIME content (identified by the id-data
   content type) and encrypted content-encryption keys for one or more
   recipients.

4.2.1.3.1.  EnvelopedData Type

   The MMHS MUST support the EnvelopedData type as specified in
   [RFC5652] Section 6.1.  The clarifications and refinements are as
   follows:

   o  The MMHS MUST support the EncryptedContentInfo type eContentType
      attribute.  The value of the eContentType MUST be id-data unless
      the content is compressed according to Section 4.2.1.4.

   o  The MMHS MUST support the EncryptedContentInfo type eContent
      attribute.  The value of the eContent MUST contain the content to
      be encrypted.  If the content is compressed using the compressed-
      data content type as defined in Section 4.2.1.4, the
      CompressedData.encapContentInfo.eContentType MUST be set to the
      id-data content type identifier of the compressed MIME content and
      the CompressedData.encapContentInfo.eContent MUST contain the MIME
      content to be compressed and protected by S/MIME.

   o  The MMHS MUST support the originatorInfo attribute if required by
      the key-management algorithm (refer to Section 4.2.1.3.1.1).

   o  The MMHS MUST support X.509 version 3 certificates.  An MMHS with
      high throughput MUST include certificates within the message.  An
      MMHS with impoverished communications SHOULD NOT send certificates
      with the message.

   o  The MMHS MUST support the certificate profile and CRL profile
      specified in [RFC5280] [RFC6818].

   o  The MMHS MUST support X.509 version 3 certificate processing
      specified in [RFC5750].

4.2.1.3.1.1.  RecipientInfo Type

   The RecipientInfo type is specified in [RFC5652] Section 6.2.  The
   clarifications and refinements are as follows:

   o  The MMHS MAY support KeyTransRecipientInfo.

   o  The MMHS MUST support KeyAgreeRecipientInfo.  The originatorKey
      attribute MUST be supported as the choice for the originator to
      specify the sender's key agreement public key.

   o  The MMHS MAY support KEKRecipientInfo.

   o  The MMHS MAY support PasswordRecipientinfo.

   o  The MMHS MAY support OtherRecipientInfo.

4.2.1.4.  Compressed-Data Content Type

   The MMHS MUST support the compressedData content type as specified in
   [RFC3274].

4.2.1.4.1.  CompressedData Type

   In the cases where the MMHS uses compressedData, it MUST only be used
   once for every message and MUST only be used around the content of
   the innermost security wrapper.

4.2.2.  S/MIME Triple Wrapping

   If the MMHS supports S/MIME protocols for providing the security
   services (defined in this profile) the MMHS MUST support military
   messages that are triple wrapped or signed only.  A triple wrapped
   message is one that has been signed, then encrypted, then signed
   again.  The signers of the inner and outer signatures may be
   different entities or the same entity.  If a military message is
   triple wrapped, the SignedData and EnvelopedData wrappers MUST follow
   the specifications described in Section 4.2.1.2 and Section 4.2.1.3
   of this profile, respectively.

4.2.3.  Organisation to Organisation Security

Internet-Draft               MMHS over SMTP                 October 2013


   The implementation of the MMHS security services is dependent upon
   the security and assurance requirements that are to be met by those
   MMHS security services.  As such, the identity of the signer of the
   MMHS message may be the user, the role the user is performing or the
   organization the user belongs to.  If the MMHS supports S/MIME
   protocols for providing the security services (defined in this
   profile) and the MMHS is providing organisation to organisation
   security services then the MMHS MUST support MSA-to-MDA S/MIME
   signing and encryption as specified in
   [I-D.melnikov-smime-msa-to-mda].

4.2.4.  DKIM Digital Signatures

   DKIM defines an organization-level digital signature authentication
   framework for Internet email, using public key cryptography and using
   the domain name service as its key server technology.  However, it is
   possible to administer DKIM to support user-level signature
   granularity.  This profile specifies the use of DKIM defined in
   [RFC6376] for providing an alternative security mechanism to S/MIME
   to deliver the Authentication of Origin (Section 4.1.2), Non-
   repudiation of Origin (Section 4.1.3) and Message Integrity
   (Section 4.1.4) security services to the MMHS.  However, the
   implementation of DKIM is dependent upon the security and assurance
   requirements that are to be met by the MMHS security services.  An
   MMHS MAY implement DKIM (to apply digital signatures for the MMHS
   message header fields and message body) to meet those security and
   assurance requirements based on one of the following use cases:

   1.  Share the organization signing identity (identified by the
       Signing Domain Identifier (SDID)) private key for signing the
       MMHS message.  The MMHS message is digitally signed by the
       organization MSA component.  This profile does not provide end to
       end security services.  This profile supports organization to
       organization Authentication of Origin, Non-repudiation of Origin
       and Message Integrity security services.

   2.  Share the organization signing identity private key for signing
       the MMHS message.  The email address of the MMHS message
       originator can be specified as the Agent or User Identifier
       (AUID).  The semantics for performing per-user identity
       differentiation with this approach MUST be agreed out-of-band and
       is outside the scope of this MMHS profile.  The MMHS message is
       digitally signed by the organization MSA component.  This profile
       does not provide end to end security services.  This profile
       supports organization to organization Authentication of Origin,
       Non-repudiation of Origin and Message Integrity security
       services.

   3.  Generate per-user public/private key pairs where the public key
       is published to distinct subdomains (of the organization domain).
       The MMHS message is signed with the user's private key and the
       signing identity is identifiable by the user's subdomain value in
       the SDID.  The MMHS message is digitally signed by the MUA.  This
       profile supports end to end Authentication of Origin, Non-
       repudiation of Origin and Message Integrity security services.

   4.  Generate per-user public/private key pairs where the public key
       is published to a unique resource record under the organization
       domain.  The MMHS message is signed with the user's private key
       and the signing identity is identifiable by the domain value in
       the SDID and the unique resource record identified by the
       selector value.  The MMHS message is digitally signed by the MUA.
       This profile supports end to end Authentication of Origin, Non-
       repudiation of Origin and Message Integrity security services.

   To provide organization to organization security services: the
   recipient MUA SHOULD support DKIM digital signature verification or
   the MUA MUST support the Authentication-Results header field as
   specified in [RFC5451] according to the security policy; and the
   organization MTA MUST support DKIM digital signature verfication and
   output the verification results (according to the security policy) to
   the Authentication-Results header field compliant with [RFC5451].

   To provide end to end security services the recipient MUA MUST
   support DKIM digital signature verification specified in [RFC6376].

   DKIM does not provide confidentiality security services.

4.2.5.  Security Labels

   If the MMHS supports S/MIME protocols for implementing security
   services then the MMHS MUST support on origination the
   ESSSecurityLabel specified in Section 3 of [RFC2634].  The MMHS MUST
   support the security-policy-identifier, security-classification,
   privacy-mark and security-categories attributes of the
   ESSSecurityLabel.  The MMHS MAY support the Equivalent Security
   Labels EquivalentLabels as specified in [RFC2634] Section 3.4.

   An MMHS MAY on origination support the SIO-Label header field as
   specified in [[i-d ref]].

   On reception the MMHS MUST support the ESSSecurityLabel and SIO-
   Label.  In the case where a military message contains a SIO-Label and
   an ESSSecurityLabel the MMHS MUST assert that the policy conveyed in
   both are the same and that the sensitivity, compartments, and other
   handling caveats that can be conveyed in both are the same.

4.2.6.  Message Header Fields

   By default, [RFC5751] secures MIME message body parts, excluding the
   message header fields.  If the MMHS implements S/MIME security
   services then the MMHS SHOULD provide a mechanism for securing the
   message header fields.  [RFC5751] includes a mechanism for protecting
   the header fields where the whole message is wrapped in a message/
   rfc822 MIME media type.  However, this approach can be problematic
   for non-S/MIME aware MUAs and does not provide a mechanism for
   signing a subset of message header fields.

   If the MMHS provides security services this profile requires that the
   MMHS SHOULD support DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures
   profiled in Section 4.2.4 for digitally signing the MMHS message
   header fields.

   The MMHS MUST include at least the following header fields to be
   signed:

   o  From

   o  Reply-To

   o  Subject

   o  Date

   o  To, Cc, Bcc (if present)

   o  Received

   o  Sender

   o  Expires

   o  Message-ID

   o  SIO-Label (if present)

   o  MMHS-Primary-Precedence (if present), MMHS-Copy-Precedence (if
      present), MMHS-Message-Type, MMHS-Extended-Authorisation-Info,
      MMHS-Authorizing-Users (if present)

   o  MT-Priority

   DKIM does not provide confidentiality security services.
