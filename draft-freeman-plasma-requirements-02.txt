                Requirements for Message Access Control

Abstract

   There are many situations where organizations want to protect
   information with robust access control, either for implementation of
   intellectual property right protections, enforcement of contractual
   confidentiality agreements or because of legal regulations.  The
   Enhanced Security Services (ESS) for S/MIME defines an access control
   mechanism which is enforced by the recipient's client after
   decryption of the message. The ESS mechanism therefore is dependent
   on the correct access policy configuration of every recipient's
   client. This mechanism also provides full access to the data to all
   recipients prior to the access control check, this is considered to
   be inadequate due to the difficulty in demonstrating policy
   compliance.

   This document lays out the deficiencies of the current ESS security
   label, and presents requirements for a new model for doing/providing
   access control to messages where the access check is performed prior
   to message content decryption. This new model also does not require
   policy configuration on the client to simplify deployment and
   compliance verification. 

   The proposed model additionally provides a method where non-X.509
   certificate credentials can be used for encryption/decryption of
   S/MIME messages.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     July 6, 2012


1.  Introduction

   The S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standard
   [RFC5652] today provides digital signatures (for message integrity
   and data origination) and encryption (for data confidentiality).  The
   Enhanced Security Services (ESS) for S/MIME [RFC2634] provides for
   additional services including security labels (eSSSecurityLabel)
   which represent the access control policy. The label is a signed
   attribute in the signed data block of a message.  The recipient of
   the message is then responsible for checking that the recipient has a
   legitimate right to see the message based on the label.  This type of
   security labeling is similar to that of stamping "Top Secret" on the
   cover of a document.  It relies on the reader to not open and read
   the document when discovered.

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652] allows for a variety
   of different types of lock boxes to be applied to an encrypted
   message.  This allows for a variety of different type of security
   mechanisms to be used by the sender, and the recipient to process the
   message.  However the S/MIME standard is currently solely based on
   X.509 certificates. This means anyone without an X.509 certificate is
   unable to leverage the S/MIME protocol for securing Email.  The vast
   majority of users on the Internet have other forms of credentials
   (passwords, one time passwords, GPG/PGP keys etc.).

1.1.  Data Access Control

   There are many situations where organizations want to include
   information which is subject to regulatory or other complex access
   control policy in Email.  Regulated information requires some form of
   robust access control to protect the confidentiality of the
   information.  While ESS for S/MIME [RFC2634] defines an access
   control mechanism for S/MIME (eSSSecurityLabel), it is an extremely
   weak form of access control as the recipient is responsible for the
   enforcement and is given access to the data even if they fail to meet
   the criteria of the label.

   An Access Control Policy defines a set of criteria and evaluation
   logic that must be satisfied in order to grant access to the
   information.  These criteria are defined in terms of attributes about
   the subject, their device or environment, their intended action on or
   use of the information or about a resource .  Examples of the types
   of attributes would include what roles the subject is assigned to
   (Role Based Access Control) or one or more attributes about the
   subject (Attribute Based Access Control).  While an ESS Security
   Label provide a standardized representation of an access policy
   identity, it does not define any methods of obtaining the necessary
   attributes or policy description in order to enforce the policy.
 


Freeman, et al.         Expires January 7, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     July 6, 2012


   Standards now exist that enable the transport of subject attributes
   [SAML-overview].  Adoption of these subject attribute protocols would
   allow a rich set of access control policies to be supported by S/MIME
   in line with other applications.

   An ESS Security label is a signed attribute of a SignedData object
   which indicates the access control policy for the message.  The fact
   that this is a signed attribute protects the integrity of the label
   and provides a tamper evident binding of the label to the message but
   does not protect the confidentiality of the body. At the point where
   you learn the access control policy to enforce on the data you
   already have access to the data.  While the signature provides a
   tamper evident integrity for the label over the clear text, it is not
   tamper proof because it is susceptible to unauthorized removal if you
   only have a SignedData message,  i.e. any Message Transport Agent
   (MTA) in the path can remove a signature layer of a SignedData
   message therefore altering the access control data.  Encrypting the
   signed message protects the confidentiality of the data and protects
   the SignedData from tampering from users unable to decrypt the
   message. However encrypting the message means that no intermediate
   agent can enforce the label policy and it does not protect the label
   from any entity who has the ability to decrypt the message.

   From a regulatory enforcement perspective this is an extremely weak
   form of access control because cryptographic access to the data is
   given before the access check.  The correct enforcement of the access
   check is dependent on the configuration of every recipient's Email
   client.  Since the cryptographic access is granted before the access
   checks, there is no cryptographic impediment for a recipient who is
   unauthorized under the policy to access the data.  A stronger
   enforcement model is needed for regulatory control for Email where
   cryptographic access is only granted after the access check is
   successful.

1.2.  Encrypted E-Mail Using Web-based Credentials

   There are many users on the Internet today who have some form of
   authentication credential but the credentials are not X.509
   certificates and who therefore cannot use S/MIME. Standard based
   services (e.g.  [SAML-overview])are now available which abstract the
   specifics of an authentication technology used used to identify a
   subject from the application itself (S/MIME in this case).  Adoption
   of this abstraction model would enable a broader set of
   authentication technologies to be able to use S/MIME to secure Email.
    It also allows for new authentication technology to be deployed
   without impacting the core S/MIME protocol at the expense of adding a
   third party to the transaction.

1.3.  Vocabulary


        Mail User Agent (MUA) is a program or service used to manage a
        user's email. The MUA may be a program run on the users computer
        or a Web service accessed via the users browser.

        Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) is a program that transfers email from
        one computer to another. An MTA implements both the sending and
        receiving of email.

        A Cryptographic Lock Box is a per recipient data structure which
        holds a content encryption key encrypted for a specific user.
        CMS implements lock boxes as RecipientInfo structures.

        Early Binding  is the concept of creating the cryptographic lock
        box for a recipient at the time the message is sent.  (See to
        Late Binding).

   Late Binding  is the concept of creating the cryptographic lock box
        for a recipient when the recipient attempts to decrypt the
        message.  Late binding has a potential downside because the
        sender cannot know what symmetric algorithms the recipient
        supports which can lead to interoperability issues. (See Early
        Binding)

   Content Encryption Key (CEK) is a key used to encrypt protected end
        user data. (See Key Encryption Key)

   Key Encryption Key (KEK) is a key used to encrypt a cryptographic
        key, often a CEK. (See Content Encryption Key)

   Authentication denotes:-

        The sender is able to establish to a known level of confidence
        the identity of the recipient or
        The recipient is able to establish to a known level of
        confidence the identity of the sender.

        		
   Confidential denotes that a message has been protected to a known
        level of confidence so that the contents are not decipherable by
        unauthorized users.

   Integrity Protected denotes that a recipient of a message can
        determine to a known level of confidence that a message has not
        been modified between the time that it was created and it was
        received by the recipient.

   Front End Attribute Exchange is when subject attributes are relayed
        from the  issuer to the relying party by the subject

   Back End Attribute Exchange is when subject attributes are directly
        sent from the issuer to the  relying party 

   Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is access control based on the
        assignment of authorizations to abstract job function or
        principle known as a role.  Subjects are then allowed to assume
        one or more roles based on their job needs. A role is distinct
        from a group because a group is a collection of subjects which
        has no intrinsic authorizations. 

   Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) is where the policy is
        specified by the set of attributes, their values and and any
        relationship between attributes required to authorize an action
        on a resource. These attributes may be provided by the subject
        as part of the decision request (Front End Attribute Exchange)
        or discovered by the policy decision service itself (Back End
        Attribute Exchange). The policy for example may require
        attributes about the subject, their device or environment or
        their intended use of the information.

1.4.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

2.  Background

   The S/MIME standard [RFC5751] provides a method to send and receive
   secure MIME messages.  While CMS allows for other types of security
   credentials to be used, S/MIME exclusively uses X.509 certificates
   [RFC5750] for the security credentials used for signing and
   encryption operations.  S/MIME uses an early binding mechanism for
   encryption keys where the sender needs to discover the public key for
   each recipient of an encrypted message before it can be sent.  This
   requires the sender to maintain a cache of all potential recipient
   certificates (e.g. in a personal address book) and/or have the
   ability to find an acceptable certificate for the recipient from a
   repository at message creation.  This key management model has
   limited the use of S/MIME for encryption for a variety of reasons.
   For example:

   o  The recipient may not have an X.509 encryption certificate

   o  The sender may not have received a signed Email with the recipient

      certificate

   o  The recipient may not have an available repository

   o  The sender may be unaware of the location of the recipient's
      repository

   o  The recipient's repository may not be accessible to the sender
      e.g. it's behind a firewall

   o  The sender may not implement the algorithms supported by the
      recipient

   o  The sender may not have a valid certificate path to a trust anchor
      for the recipients certificate 

   If one or more recipient certificates are missing then the sender is
   left with a stark choice: send the message unencrypted or remove the
   recipients without certificates from the message.

   The use of secure mailing lists has the ability to provide some
   relief to the problem. The original sender does not need to know the
   appropriate encryption information for all of the recipients of the
   mailing list, just for the mailing list itself.  It can thus be
   thought of as a form of late-binding of recipient information for the
   originating sender.  However it is still early-binding encryption for
   the mail list agent; as it needs to perform all of the gathering and
   processing of certificate information for every recipient that the
   agent will relay the message to. The use of a mailing list also means
   that the originating sender has no chance to perform any sender side
   filtering on who should receive an Email based on the recipient's
   attributes as they do not know the full list of the recipients.

   In many regulated environments end-to-end confidentiality between
   sender and recipients by itself is not enough.  The regulatory policy
   requires some form of access control checks before access to the data
   should be granted.  In many inter-organization collaboration
   scenarios it's impossible for the sender to satisfy the access checks
   on behalf of the recipients since they don't have, and frequently
   should not have access to, all the recipient's attributes because to
   do so may be a breach of the recipients privacy. Indeed to release
   the attributes to the sender may require that the sender's attributes
   first be released to the recipient's attributes provider.  It's a
   fundamental tenet of good security practice that users should control
   the release of data about themselves.

2.1.  ESS Security Labels

   Security labels are an optional security service for S/MIME defined
   in Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME [RFC2634].  The ESS security
   label allows classification of the sensitivity of the message
   contents using a hierarchical taxonomy in terms of the impact of
   unauthorized disclosure of the information [RFC3114].  The security
   label can also indicate access control such as full time employees
   only or US nationals only.  ESS security labels are authenticated
   attributes of a signer-info structure in a SignedData object.  The
   label when applied to signed clear text data provides the access
   control decisions for the plain text.  If applied to cipher text such
   as the outer layer of a triple wrapped S/MIME message the label is
   used for course grained optimization such as routing.

2.1.1.  Problems With ESS Security Labels

   ESS Security Labels have been found to have a number of limitations.

   1.  If the label is on the innermost content, access to the plain
       text is provided to the recipient (in some form) independent of
       the label evaluation as it will be processed for the purpose of
       hash computation as part of signature validation.  Depending on
       how a triple wrapped message is processed by the recipient's CMS
       code, the inner content may be processed for signature validation
       even before the outer signature is validated.  This would happen
       for a stream based CMS processor which starts processing inner-
       layers immediately rather than finishing processing of each layer
       and caching the intermediate results.

   2.  Labels applied can be removed in transit.  If a signed layer is
       seen then it can be removed by any agent that processes the
       message (such as a Message Transit Agent).  If the label is
       protected by an encryption layer then it can be removed by any
       agent that has key access to the message (Encryption Mail List
       agents or Spam Filtering software would be two such examples).

   3.  Policies are identified by Object Identifiers.  This makes for a
       small tight encoding, but it does not provide any mechanism for
       an Email client to discover how to enforce a new access control
       policy if the message contains a policy the client is unaware of.
       This provides a stark choice: ignore the access control policy
       and grant access to the message or block access to the message.
       Object identifiers also do not provide a good display name for a
       user so that they could manually find and download a new policy.

   4.  The current ESS standard only allows for a single policy label in
       a message, no standardized method of composing multiple policy
       labels together has been defined.  This is adequate for course
       grained policy binding to express a limited set of choices such
 


Freeman, et al.         Expires January 7, 2013                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     July 6, 2012


       as with information sensitivity which typically provides a
       hierarchy of 3-5 choices. Many data sets need to be subject to
       multiple access control policies.  For instance, a message may
       contain information that is both propriety and export controlled.
        Trying to represent combinations of policies via a single policy
       label would lead to an exponential growth in the number of policy
       labels.

   5.  ESS Labels do not provide for any auditing of who has been
       granted accessed the message.  All policy evaluation is local to
       the recipient's machine, no centralized logging of access to the
       message can be performed

   6.  Enforcement of the policy occurs on the recipient's machine, the
       compliance with the policy is dependent on the state of the
       configuration of every receiving agent.  The policy is enforce by
       whatever module is located on the user's system, and updates to
       the policy may be eradicate.  For cross cooperate systems, this
       means that the policy provided by Company A must be installed on
       Company B machines, or Company B must install a policy that
       Company A will accept as being equivalent to their own policy
       enforcement module. Additionally any time that a new version of
       the policy module is rolled out; there will be a time lag before
       every recipient machine will have the updated module.  This makes
       policy compliance practically impossible in anything but a small
       closed environment.

   7.  Access to the message cannot be granted or removed after the
       message has been sent. Therefore is a recipient has a designated
       alternate recipient they will not be able to read the message.
       Also if the sender subsequently learns one of the recipients was
       in error, they cannot correct the mistake. 

2.2.  Access Control and the Web

   A prerequisite for many web transactions is the disclosure of
   attributes about the subject such as name, age, Email address,
   physical location, address, credit card number, social security
   number etc.  Some attributes lend themselves to easy verification but
   many do not.  An assertion of an Email address can be verified by
   sending an Email to the address containing a secret ephemeral
   challenge.  Subsequent demonstration of knowledge of the ephemeral
   challenge verifies the Email address assertion.  Other assertions
   such as "this is my credit card account number" are not easily
   verified.  The fact that it is a valid credit card number can be
   verified but not the binding to the subject attempting to use it. 
   Where a claim is not easily verified it is often combined with other
   assertions under the assumption that knowledge of this larger data

   set verifies all the assertions in the data set.  If you know the
   account number, billing address, etc., 'of course' you must be the
   account holder.  This is a very weak form of verification as is often
   demonstrated by the growth of identity theft; much of this bigger
   data set is often publicly available via social networks or easily
   guessed e.g. the most popular professions for a parent is dead or
   retired.  Many of the assertions which are harder to verify are based
   on government issued documents such as a birth certificates, driver's
   license, identity card or passport.  This requires an exchange of the
   documents between the relying party and the subject. For a small
   number of high value transactions (e.g. opening a new account) with
   relying parties that have widespread physical presence (e.g. a bank
   or Post Office) this is acceptable because the applicant can present
   themselves with the required documentation in person.  However,web
   based relying parties cannot perform an in person exchange of
   documents to verify information on government issued documents. The
   approach taken with such relying parties is to have trusted assertion
   providers where the assertion provider can perform an in person
   exchange of documents with the subject then vouch for the set of
   assertions they have verified.

   SAML [SAML-core] defines an XML framework for describing and
   exchanging attributes about subjects.  The entity making the
   assertions about the subject is known as the assertion provider, the
   entity consuming the assertions is known as the relying party.  The
   well-known scenarios for using SAML are:

   o  Single Sign On across systems on different platform technology

   o  Federated Identity between business partners

   o  Web Services and other standards e.g.  SOAP based protocols


   The critical difference between SAML and pure authentication
   protocols such as mutually authenticated TLS is that SAML is able to
   exchange the rich and variable set of assertions which are necessary
   for authorizing transactions.  X.509 certificates can exchange a
   limited and fixed set of identity assertions such as an x.500
   distinguished name, Email address, Kerberos principal name, etc. 
   SAML is able to do this in addition to an extensible set of other
   assertions about the subject such as: date of birth, business sign-
   off limits levels, etc. SAML additionally defines a number of
   query/response style profiles [SAML-QUERY] that allow for a relying
   party to specify the type of attributes that are required to evaluate
   a policy.

   SAML also abstracts the details of the authentication protocol from

   the relying party.  The assertion provider can use a broad range of
   authentication mechanisms such as passwords, one time passwords,
   biometrics, X.509 certificates, etc., without impacting the relying
   party.  The assertion provider can include the details of the
   authentication mechanism or its strength using an established
   strength scale such as NIST SP800-63-1 [SP800-63-1].  The relying
   party can then inspect the claims about how or how strongly the
   subject authenticated to the identity provider to determine if it
   complies with its access policy.  Low value transactions can use
   simple short lived assertions where possession of the assertion alone
   is considered acceptable for the transaction risk.  These are known
   as Bearer assertions.  Higher value transactions can require proof of
   possession keys (either symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic keys)
   where the subject demonstrates knowledge of a cryptographic secret to
   the relying party via a HMAC or digital signature.  These are defined
   by the SAML specification as Holder of Key assertions.  The subject
   has to demonstrate possession of the key to the relying party. Holder
   of key assertions can be either symmetric or asymmetric keys.

2.3.  Information Asset Protection

   Information Asset Protection (IAP) is a concept developed by the
   Transglobal Secure Collaboration Program (TSCP), a working group
   comprised of the major players in the western Aerospace and Defense
   industry.  The industry is highly regulated and operates in an
   environment with many policies governing the access to information
   assets.  These policies may be motivated by the desire to protect
   intellectual property, the confidentiality of information, or are
   imposed by government regulators such as the US International Traffic
   in Arms Regulations (ITAR) from the US Department of State.  They
   apply to the information assets in whatever form the asset may take
   and are independent of the application used to create the
   information.  These policies take many forms, e.g. verification the
   recipient has demonstrated a need to know the information because
   they are working on a specific project, that they have passed the
   appropriate background and nationality checks, or that they have
   signed the appropriate non-disclosure agreement.  What is needed is a
   policy driven information centric protection where the applicable
   policies either is manually or automatically attached to the
   information and based on the policy the system understands what
   access control and data protection is necessary.

   Email is an application widely used in the Aerospace and Defense
   industry.  S/MIME is widely used today and provides sender to
   recipient confidentiality.  This protects the contents of the message
   from discloser to unauthorized third parties e.g. while it is in
   transit between MTA's or while at rest in a MTA message queue or
   recipient's mailbox.  However it does not impose any finer grained

   access control such as those required by many policies.  S/MIME does
   define an extension mechanism for access control via an ESS security
   label [RFC2634] thou this mechanism has drawbacks (see above).

2.4.  Authentication Assurance Frameworks

   A number of organizations have created taxonomies to define the
   possible levels of identity assurance for electronic authentication.
   The objective of the framework is to provide a simple abstraction the
   details of any specific combination of identity proofing, credential
   technology, authentication technology from the authorization policy.
   These frameworks have been drafted by industry organizations [lib-
   iaf][kan-iaf] and governments [SP800-63-1].  While all of these
   frameworks may not agree on every aspect, at a macro level they do
   exhibit many similarities.  A common theme in many is the adoption of
   a small number of levels of identity assurance, typically between 3-
   5. A simplified description of the levels is:

        Level 1  Negligible confidence in the asserted identity

        Level 2  Some confidence in the asserted identity

        Level 3  Significant confidence in the asserted identity

        Level 4  High confidence in the asserted identity

   The framework defines broad characteristics in the area of identity
   proofing, credential type and management, identity provider
   authentication and relying party authentication.

3.  Use Case Scenarios

   This section documents some use case scenarios the new protocol aims
   to support.

   Author Note: Add legal document signing scenarios

3.1 Consumer to Consumer Secure Email

   One of the issues that is stopping the use of secure Email in
   personal mail is the fact that consumers find certificates difficult
   to obtain and then use. One of the possible use cases of PLASMA is to
   try and deal with this.  The details of the use case are therefore:
   Alice wants to send an Email message to Bob that is secure so that
   eavesdroppers cannot read it. Bob however has never obtained an X.509
   certificate for this purpose.  Alice needs to ensure the following: 

   (a)  Only Bob can read the Email. 

   (b)  Bob has the ability to verify the Email is from Alice.  

   (c)  Bob has the ability to verify the Email message has not been
        modified since Alice sent it.  


   The sequence of events could be as follows:  

   1.  Alice composes the Email to Bob.  

   2.  Alice's Email client allows here to classify the Email.  Alice
        classifies the Email using Personal Communication which is a
        basic policy provided by her ISP.  

   3.  Alice's Email client knows the protections to apply to a Personal
        communication; it knows to encrypt and sign the message.  

   4.  The protected Email is able to flow securely and seamlessly
        through existing Email infrastructure to Bob. The data is
        protected while in transit or at rest.  

   5.  Bob receives the Email and sees that it is a secure message.  Bob
        can verify that the encrypted message has not been altered. Bob
        attempts to open and decrypt the Email.  If Bob is on the same
        ISP as Alice, then the same username/password as he uses to get
        his Email to obtain the needed keys.  If Bob is on an ISP that
        is federated with Alice's ISP then an infrastructure such as
        SAML, OpenID, OAUTH or ABFAB could be used to validate Bob's
        identity and allow the needed keys to be released.

3.2.  Business to Consumer Secure Email  
   There are many examples of business to consumer secure Email
   scenarios where the Email could potentially contain sensitive data.
   This would include doctor, patient; bank, account holder; Medical
   insurance, insured person. Two examples are presented here.

3.2.1 Bank Statement Email

   In the first example, a bank (The Bank of Alice) has determined that
   it will be using Email to distribute statements to its customers
   (Bob).  The information is confidential, so any channel of
   communication they selects must protect Bob's privacy.  The bank
   needs to ensure the following:  

   (a)  Only Bob (or additional owners of the account) can read the
        Email

   (b)  Bob authenticates with a sufficient level of assurance. The same
        authentication level used to do on-line banking would be
        considered sufficient 

   (c)  Bob can verify the statement is from his bank  

   (d)  Bob can verify the statement has not been modified since his
        bank sent it. 

   The sequence of events would be as follows:  

   1.  As part of routine end of the month processing, the Bank composes
   an Email to Bob. They includes the statement of balances and activity
   either as an attachment or as the body of the message.  

   2.  The statement mailer for Alice has been configured to use a
   specific policy on the Email.  

   3.  The statement mailer for Alice knows the protections to apply
   based on the policy; it knows to encrypt and integrity-protect
   protects the message and what level of assurance required for the the
   recipients identity     

   4.   The protected email is able to flow securely and seamlessly
   through existing email infrastructure to Bob. the data is protected
   while in transit or at rest. 

   5.   Bob receives the email as sees it is a secure message from  his
   Bank. Bob can verify the message has not been altered as it is signed
   by the his Bank.  Bob uses his on-line banking credentials to prove
   his identity to prove his identity to the email system and  obtain
 


Freeman, et al.         Expires January 7, 2013                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     July 6, 2012


   the keys necessary to decrypt the message. 

   The same process could be used for any messages sent between the bank
   and its customer.  Thus messages dealing with loan applications and
   changes in bank policies can be sent out in the same manner,
   potentially using slightly different policies.  In some of these
   cases it might be in the bank's interests to record in an audit trail
   if and when the keys were handed out on some Emails.  For a
   statement, the Bank would not expect a reply to occur, however for
   other types of messages it should be possible for Bob to reply under
   the same level of protection.  If Bob uses his on-line credentials
   when obtaining  the policy description blob sent with the message
   there is a degree of assurance that the bank has similar to using
   web-based messaging today that it was Bob who sent the message. 

3.2.2  Doctor-Patient Communications  

   In the second example, let's say that Alice is a doctor and has
   received test results for her patient Bob. This information is
   confidential, so any channel of communication she selects must
   protect Bob's privacy.  Alice elects to use Email to reach Bob
   quickly with news of the results.  In this respect it is similar to
   the previous use case; however there are some additional
   complications that might need to be dealt with as well.  Depending on
   who Bob is and where is currently is there are additional people that
   may also need to be automatically informed of the same information,
   or need to have the ability to access the contents of the message.
   Examples of these would be Bob's spouse, the individual who is making
   care decisions for Bob (i.e.  Bob's parent), and the individual in
   charge of dealing with Bob's day-to-day health care (i.e. a charge
   nurse in a hospital or a visiting nurse).  All of these people may
   have the same need to know as Bob. There is also the possibility that
   some parts of the message may need to be released to some individuals
   but not to others.  As an example, the mail message could contain a
   prescription, that specific portion of the message may need to be
   read by Bob's pharmacist.  Alice needs to ensure the following:  

   (a)  Only authorized individuals can read the Email.  However, the
        definition of authorized will vary with the content of the
        message and thus the policy applied. (General health issues will
        certainly be treated differently than mental health issues, even
        by a General Practitioner.)  

   (b)  The message readers authenticate with a level 2 or above level
        of identity assurance.  

   (c)  The Bob can verify the Email is from Alice.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     July 6, 2012


   (d)  The Bob can verify the Email has not been modified after Alice
        sent it.  

   The sequence of events would be as follows:  

   1.  Alice composes the Email to Bob. She includes some comments and
        suggestions for Bob and attaches the test results.  

   2.  Alice's Email client allows her to classify the Email.  Alice
        classifies the Email as a Doctor-Patient communication. (a) As a
         side effect of classifying the Email message, the policy may
        suggest or mandate additional individuals that the communication
        should be addressed to.  

   3.  Alice's Email client knows the protections to apply to Doctor-
        Patient communication; it knows to encrypt and integrity-protect
        the message.  

   4.  The protected Email is able to flow securely and seamlessly
        through existing Email infrastructure to Bob. The data is 
        protected while in transit or at rest.

   5.  Bob receives the Email as sees it is a secure message from Alice.
        Bob can verify the message has not been         altered. Bob
        attempts to opens the Email.  Bob provides a Level 2 password to
        retrieve the necessary decryption       keys. After Bob has
        proved his identity, he is able to read the Email.  

   There are number of different places where the identity provider for
   Bob could live.  The first is at Alice's office, Bob already has a
   face-to-face relationship with Alice and the credential could be
   setup in her office.  A second  could be Bob's insurance provider. 
   Bob has a relationship with his insurance provider as does Alice,
   thus it can serve as an trusted identity provider to healthcare
   providers.  A third  location could be a federation of doctors in an
   area, potentially  with other health providers (such as hospitals and
   convalescent centers), Bob has setup an identity with Alice, but if
   he gets referred to Charlie by Alice for some procedures, Charlie
   would not need to setup a new identity for Bob but instead could just
   refer to  Alice for the necessary identity proof.  Many of these
   types of situations could be dealt with by [I-D.ietf-abfab-arch].  

   There are a number of other additional services that could be
   provided by the policy system.  One example would be that if the
   information was time critical, if Bob does not access his message
   within a given time period, the policy server could notify Alice of
   this fact so that an alternate method of communication can be
   attempted with the same information.

3.3  Business to Business Ad-Hoc Email Author note: (add alternate
   recipient's as well)

   Early in the relationship between two companies, it is frequently
   necessary to exchange sensitive information.  This needs to occur
   before the relationship has matured to the point that a formal
   relationship is reflected through a legal agreement. Business owners
   need the agility to interact with potential partners without having
   to engage their respective IT staffs as a prerequisite of the
   communication.  As example, the IT staff might need to provide cross
   certifications and exposure of certificate repositories.

   As an example, Charlie works for Company Foo. He has just met Dave
   from Company Bar to discuss the prospect of a potential new business
   opportunity.  Following the meeting, Charlie wants to send Dave some
   sensitive information relating to the new business opportunity.  When
   Charlie sends the Email to Dave with the sensitive content, he must
   ensure the following objectives:

   (a)  Only Dave can read the Email

   (b)  Dave authenticates with a level 2 or above level of identity
        assurance

   (c)  The Dave can verify the Email is from Charlie

   (d)  The Dave can verify the Email has not been tampered with

   (e)  Charlie may also need to keep a record of the fact that Dave
        accessed the message and when it was done.

   The sequence of events Charlie would use is as follows:

   1.   Charlie composes the Email to Dave.  He include some sensible
        information relating to potential terms and conditions for the
        new contract that Foo and Bar would sign to form a partnership
        for the business opportunity.

   2.   Charlie's Email client allows him to classify the Email.  He
        classifies the Email as an Ad-hoc pre-contractual communication.

   3.   Charlie's client knows the protections to apply to Ad-hoc pre-
        contractual communication; it knows to encrypt and integrity-
        protect the message and the level of assurance required for the
        recipients identity.

   4.   The protected Email is able to flow securely and seamlessly
        through existing Email infrastructure to the recipients (Dave in
 


Freeman, et al.         Expires January 7, 2013                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     July 6, 2012


        this case).  The data is protected while in transit or at rest.

   5.   Dave receives the Email as sees it is a secure message from
        Charlie. (Charlie requires level 2, Dave uses a password) Dave
        is able to prove his identity to the level of assurance
        requested by Charlie so is able to read the Email. The
        organization Dave work for has an identity service which he uses
        to prove his identity for Charlie's Email. Dave opens the Email.

   If Dave replies to the Email from Charlie, the new message inherits
   the policy from the original messages so the entire message thread
   has the same policy.  The policy also applies to messages forwarded
   by Dave because it contains information from Charlie and Company Foo
   wants consistent policy enforcement on its information.

3.4  Business to Business Regulated Email

   As business relationship mature they often result in a formal
   contractual agreement to work together. Contractual agreements would
   define a number of work areas and deliverables. These deliverables
   may be subject to multiple corporate and or legal policies for access
   control, authentication and integrity. Some classes of Email may have
   information which is legally binding or the sender needs to
   demonstrate authorization to send some types of message where
   authority to send the message is derives from their role or function.
   Also many regulated environments need to be able to verify the
   information for a extended period - well beyond the typical lifetime
   of a users certificate.  The set of policies applicable to an Email
   is potentially subject to change as the different users contribute
   information to the Email thread.

3.4.1 Regulated Email Requiring a Confidentiality Policy

   Company Foo has been awarded a contract to build some equipment
   (Program X).  The equipment is covered by export control which
   requires information only be released to authorized recipients under
   the terms of the export control licence.  Company Bar is a foreign
   subcontractor to company Foo working on Program X. Company Foo sets
   up some business rules for access to program X data to ensure
   compliance with the  export control licence requirements.  Company
   Foo also set up separate rules to cover the confidentiality of its
   intellectual property contributed to Program X. Company Bar also sets
   up its own policies to protect the confidentiality  its own
   intellectual property it contributes to Program X. As part of the
   agreement between Foo and Bar, they have agreed to mutually respect
   each other's policies.

     Frank is an employee of Company Foo. He has been assigned as a

     design team leader on Program X and an individual contributor on
     Program X integration. Frank wants to send some mail as a team
     leader to colleagues working on Program X in both Companies Foo and
     Bar.

     Grace is an employee of Company Bar. She has also been assigned to
     the design team of Program X. 

     When Frank sends the Email with Program X regulated content he must
     ensure compliance with the export control policies. When Frank
     sends a Program X email, recipient's are authorized to read the
     contents to ensure Company Foo remains in compliance with its
     export control licence. 

     If Frank also includes Company Foo intellectual property in an
     email, he must also ensure recipients are authorized to read the
     contents.

     When Grace receives a Program X email, she must provide attributes
     about herself to prove compliance with the export control policy.
     If the email also contains Company Foo intellectual property, she
     must also provide attributes to show she is authorized to read the
     information under the agreement between Company Foo and Company
     Bar.

     If Grace sends an email with Company Bar intellectual property, she
     must ensure recipients are authorized to read the contents under
     the agreement between Company Bar and Company Foo. 

   When Frank sends a Program X Email he must ensure the following
   objectives:

   (a)  Only recipients who meet the Program X policy and or Company
        Foo's intellectual property protection policy can read the Email
   (b)  The recipients authenticates with an acceptable level of
        assurance (i.e. level 3 or above)
   (c)  Recipients present any other attributes about themselves
        necessary to verify compliance with the applicable policies
        (theirs program assignment, nationality, professional or

   (f) Recipients are made aware that the message is a Program X Email
        and the contents can only be shared with other Program X workers
        and/or the message contains Company Foo's intellectual property

   The sequence of events Frank would use is as follows:

   (1)  Frank composes the Email and includes a Program X distribution
        list as a recipient. He include some information relation to
        Program X. Frank also includes some information which is Company
        Foo's Intellectual Property.
   (2)  Frank's Email client allows him to select the Program X role.
        The client then allows Frank to select from a set of policies
        appropriate for Program X. 
   (3)  Frank selects the Program X content and Company Foo IP policies
        from the list of available policies. 

   The Email client knows to encrypt the message, the key size and
   algorithm to use to use; the message needs to be be signed with a
   level 3 or above certificate. 

   (4)  Frank clinks the send Email button. The client signs the Email
        using his smart card and a certificate indicating the signature.
        The Client then encrypts the message and obtains data from a
        server that will enforce the access control requirements for
        Frank, and sends it to his Email server.

   The Email is able to flow securely and seamlessly through existing
   Email infrastructure recipients of the distribution list. Grace is on
   the distribution list so receives the Email from Frank. 

   (5)  Grace receives the Email, Grace's client provides the attributes
        necessary to comply with the policy which includes her level 3
        encryption certificate to the PDEP.
   (6)  Once Grace has shown she passes the policy requirements, the
        PDEP releases the message CEK to Grace using her level 3
        encryption certificate.
   (7)  Grace uses her smart card to open the message. She sees the
        message is signed by Frank and marked with both the Program X
        andor Company Foo IP policies 

   If Grace replies to the Email from Frank, the new message inherits
   the policy from the original messages.  If Grace includes some
   information which is Company Bar's IP she also adds her companies IP
   protection policy requirements to the message.

   Frank receives the reply from Grace.  Frank is able to prove his
   identity to the level requested by Grace and provides the requested
   attributes about himself to satisfy both the Program X export

   control, the Company Foo IP protection policies as well as the
   Company Bar IP protection policies.  Frank opens the Email.

   The policy also applies to messages forwarded by Frank and Grace
   because it contains information from Company Foo and Company Bar both
   companies wants consistent policy enforcement on its information.

3.4.2  Regulated Email Requiring an Integrity Policy

   Company Foo has been awarded a contract to build some equipment
   (Program X). This equipment is regulated by the National Aviation
   Authority (NAA) for Company Foo.  The NAA requires strict procedures
   at a number of significant events for Program X such as in the
   design, and maintenance of the Project X e.g. when a design is
   complete and released to manufacturing. The sign of process requires
   personal be suitability qualified and that the documentation needs to
   be maintained for the service life of the project (25 years for
   Program X)

   Company Foo has instigated an email based sign off procedure to
   simplify sign off and reduce costs. It also has authored a policy for
   compliance with the NAA requirements. At the appropriate time,
   signoff email is sent to the designated program members. Recipient
   apply the NAA policy  when they reply to the sign off request
   message.

   Frank is a the lead on the Program X design team. They have a design
   which they believe can be released to the integration team. Frank
   instigates the sign off process for the design. 

   Grace is one of the sign-off design team members for Program X. She
   receives the sign off email. Grace responds and applies the sign-off
   policy to the email. The policy requires Grace to authenticate with
   the required level of assurance,  present attributes about herself,
   her work effort assignments and professional qualifications to
   demonstrate compliance with the policy to send the message. The
   message is signed to indicate Grace passed the policy. 

   When Frank sends a Program X Sign Off  Email  the system must ensure
   the following objectives:

   (a)  Frank was authenticated to the level of assurance under the
        policy as the originator of the email
   (b)  Frank possessed the necessary attributes as required to
        authorize Frank to send the sign-off email
   (c)  The contents of the email are accurate to the level of assurance
        required by the policy
   (d)  Frank was fully aware and intended to send the sign off email to

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     July 6, 2012


        the level of assurance as required by the policy
   (e) The state of Franks system was known to the level of assurance
        required under the policy to be free from agents which might
        interfere with the sign off process
   (f) Recipients can easily confirm over the lifetime as required by
        the policy that Frank passed the policy without having to know
        specifics of hat the policy entailed. 

   The sequence of events Frank would use is as follows:

   (1)  Frank receives the sign off request email.
   (2)  Frank's replies to the email and completes the form data in the
        email so show he is approving the sign-off
   (3)  Frank slicks the send button to send the email
   (4)  Frank receives a sign-off confirmation dialogue before the email
        is sent where he has to confirm his intent is to approve the
        sign off of the component.

   Franks system submits the decision request to send the sign-off
   email. His system is asked to provide data about Frank, the state of
   Franks system, and the data being authenticated. If Frank's passes
   the policy, his system receives a signed statement the message passes
   the policy which is attached to the email and the message sent. 


3.5 Delegation of Access to Email 
   There are a number of times when either others are given access to a
   recipients mailbox or Email is forwarded to other recipients based on
   recipients rules. This may be a long standing relationship such as
   when an assistant is given access to an executives mailbox.
   Alternatively it may be a temporary relationship due to short term
   needs e.g. to cover for a  vacation.  

   Grace is going on vacation. While grace is away, Brian will act as a
   delegate for Grace. Grace configures a mailbox rule to forward
   Program X Email to Brian for the duration of her vacation. Brian is
   able to satisfy the policy requirements for the Program X Email as
   outlined above and is therefore able to open the protected Email sent
   to Grace. Frank does not need to take any actions to allow Brian to
   access the Email.

3.6 Regulated Industry Email

   Some organizations work in area which are intrinsically subject to
   policy such as regulatory policy e.g. healthcare. In such
   environments the policies are often tied to the roles of the
   participates, the institution they are working at and the subject of
   the exchange.

   Hanna is a primary care physician working for FooBar Healthcare. She
   has a patient which she is referring to a specialist Ida for further
   investigations. Ida works at the Bar Hospital. Hanna needs to send
   the relevant patient notes, test results and comments to Ida. Hanna
   knows she needs to comply with the confidentiality regulations and
   needs to respect her patients consent decree for the privacy of their
   Healthcare information. When Hanna sends the referral message she
   must ensure:

   (a)  Only recipients who meet the healthcare regulatory policy and
        the patients consent decree can read the Email
   (b)  The message has the appropriate level of integrity and data
        origination as required by the policies
   (c)  The recipients authenticate with an acceptable level of
        assurance (i.e. level 3 or above)
   (d)  Recipients present attributes about themselves necessary to
        verify compliance with the policies (e.g. their professional
        qualification, professional registration, affiliated healthcare
        facility and department)
   (e)  Recipients can verify the Email is from the sender (Hanna) to
        the level of assurance as defined by the message policy (i.e.
        level 3 or above)
   (f)  Recipients can verify the Email has not been tampered with the
        level of assurance as defined by the message policy
   (g)  Recipients are made aware that the message is a Patient referral
        and contains sensitive patient data.        workers.
   The sequence of events Frank would use is as follows:

   (1)  Hanna composes the Email and includes Ida as a recipient. She
        includes the patient information, test results and comments in
        the Email
   (2)  Hanna's Email client allows her to select a business context
        which is appropriate for her work. Hanna selects a Patient
        Consultation context.
   (3) Hanna selects the Patient Referral and Patient Consent decree
        policies from the list of available policies. 

   The Email client knows the protections to apply to the Email; to
   encrypt and integrity-protect the message, the level of assurance
   required for the recipient's identity and what recipient attributes
   are necessary to access the message.

   (4)  Hanna clinks the send Email button. The client signs the Email
        using Hanna smart card. The Client then encrypted the message
        and sends it to his Email server.

   The Email is able to flow securely and seamlessly through existing
   Email infrastructure to recipients of the distribution list. Grace is

   on the distribution list so receives the Email from Frank. 

   (5)  Ida receives the Email as sees it is a secure message from
        Hanna. Ida's client provides the attributes necessary to comply
        with the policy which includes her level 3 encryption
        certificate to the PDEP.
   (6)  Once Ida has shown she passes the policy requirements, the PDEP
        releases the message CEK to Ida using her level 3 encryption
        certificate.
   (7)  Ida uses her smart card to open the message. She sees the
        message is marked with both the Patient Referral and Sensitive
        Patient Data policies 

3.7 Regulated Email Compliance Verification

        TBD

3.8  Email Pipeline Inspection
   TBD add pre-auth and regular access

   Organizations have a huge incentive to want to some level of
   inspection on all mails entering or leaving the organization.  This
   is desired for many different reasons.  Inspection of mail leaving an
   organization is targeted towards making sure that it does not leak
   confidential information. It also behooves them to check that they
   are not a source of malicious content or spam.  Inbound mail is
   checked primarily for malicious content, phishing attempts as well as
   spam.

   Company Foo receives Email from the Internet.  Company Foo has a
   policy to scan inbound Email with a view to remove inappropriate or
   malicious content.  The scanning of inbound Email for Company Foo can
   happen on their own servers or it may be outsourced to a third party.
   This works fine as long as the Email is not encrypted, however in
   that event the server will have a policy on how to deal with
   encrypted mail.  For some companies, encrypted mail will be passed
   through and virus detection software on the recipient's client will
   be relied on.  In other circumstances, the decryption key used by the
   recipient is shared with the gateway software so that it can decrypt
   the message.  

   The ability to decrypt and check the content for malicious content is
   highly desirable even when a PLASMA encrypted Email message is
   encountered.  The methods that this can be dealt with using on of the
   following methods:  

     1.  The scanning server authenticates to the policy server as the
     entity doing virus and malware scanning.  If the policy has
 


Freeman, et al.         Expires January 7, 2013                [Page 25]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     July 6, 2012


     specific attributes that allow for access to be granted to such a
     scanning service, the appropriate decryption keys will be released
     and the server will scan the mail and take appropriate action.  

     2.  The policy server is configured with information about the
     server took various gateways (both internal and external) and has
     certificates for the known gateways.  The policy server can then
     return a normal X.509 recipient info structure (lockbox) to the 
     sender of the message for direct inclusion in the recipient info
     list.  This allows normal processing by the scanning software
     without the necessity to stop and query the policy server for
     keying information at a cost of needing wider configuration. 

     3.  If the scanning server cannot gain access to the decrypted
     content using one of the two proceeding methods, it either passes 
     the encrypted mail on the the recipient(s) without scanning it or
     it rejects the mail.  This decision is based on local policy.  If
     the message is passed to the recipient, then the necessary scanning
     either will not be done or needs to be done on the client's system
     after the message has been decrypted.  


3.9 Scalable Decision Making

   Collaboration involvers working with partners and suppliers. These
   collaborations may be short or long lived, with small or very large
   number of participants. Organizations therefore need  flexibility in
   deployment and scaling. Organizations do not want to be locked into
   having to provide capacity themselves. Senders would be happy to
   delegate decisions to partners providing those decisions use the sets
   of rules they define for their data. Likewise partners would be happy
   to leverage their local decision capacity providing they don't have
   to duplicate rules themselves, and can simply and easily use policies
   published by their partners. Also organization may want to use cloud
   based decision services as a cost effective way to add capacity and
   to be able to respond to transient capacity fluctuations.  

   todo rest of scenario 

3.10  Related scenarios

   There are other scenarios which are related to the Email cases
   because they would be subject to the same policy requirements.  Email
   allows users to create content and transport it to a set of
   recipients.  You can perform similar actions with other formats such
   as documents and instant messages.  Policy is agnostic to the
   underlying technology therefore if an organization has a policy
   relating to a type of information, then that policy would apply to

   the same content in an Email, a document an instant message, etc.

3.10.1.  Document Protection

   This scenario is very similar to 3.4 and 3.6 above.  The difference
   is that the information being generated is in the form of a document
   not an Email.  It could be as part of an ad-hoc sharing or a
   regulated sharing or information.

   Frank is an employee of Company Foo. He has been assigned to Program
   X. Grace is an employee of Company Bar. She has been assigned to
   Program X. Frank creates a document for the program.  He also
   includes some Company Foo IP in the document.  When Frank creates the
   document he must ensure compliance with export control regulations
   and his corporate IP protection policies.  Frank must ensure:

   1.  Only users who meet the Program X policy or Company Foo's
        intellectual property protection policy can open the document

   2.  Users authenticates with an acceptable level of assurance as
        defined by the set of policies applied to the document

   3.  Users present any other attributes about themselves necessary to
        verify compliance with the applicable policies.

   4.  Users can verify who the author was to an acceptable level of
        assurance as defined by the document policy

   5.  Users can verify the document has not been tampered with to an
        acceptable level of assurance as defined by the document policy

   6.  They can also tell it is a Program X document and the contents
        can only be shared with other Program X workers.

   Frank creates a document for Program X. He include some information
   relation to Program X. Frank also includes some information which is
   Company Foo's IP.

   Franks word processor client allows him to classify the document.
   Frank classifies the document as Program X and Company Foo
   proprietary information.

   The word processor client knows the protections to apply to the
   document; to encrypt and integrity-protect the document, the level of
   assurance required for the users identity and what user attributes
   are necessary to access the document.

   The document is able to be published on a cloud based Web portal. The

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     July 6, 2012


   document is protected while in transit to the portal or at rest on
   the portal.  The document is also protected on any backup or replica
   of the portal data.  Frank does not to worry about where on the
   portal he publishes the document.  He can make the most appropriate
   choose based on the project and the document content.

   Grace sees the document on the portal and tries to open the document.
   Grace is able to prove her identity to the level requested by Frank
   and provides the requested attributes about herself to satisfy both
   the Program X export control and the Company Foo IP protection
   policies.  Grace opens the document.

   If Grace edits the document and includes some information which is
   Company Bar's IP so adds her companies IP protection policy
   requirements to the document.  Grace saves the updated document to
   the same location on the portal.

   Frank sees that Grace has updated the document on the portal.  Frank
   is able to prove his identity to the level requested by both the
   Company Foo and company Bar policies and provides the requested
   attributes about himself to satisfy both the Program X export
   control, the Company Foo IP protection policies as well as the
   Company Bar IP protection policies.  Frank opens the document.

3.10.2 Instant Message Protection

   This scenario is very similar to 3.4 and 3.6 above.  The difference
   is that the information being generated is in the form of a instant
   message not an Email.  It could be as part of an ad-hoc sharing or a
   regulated sharing or information.

   Frank is an employee of Company Foo. He has been assigned to Program
   X. Grace and Hank are employees of Company Bar and also has been
   assigned to Program X. Frank want to discuss an urgent topic with
   Grace and Hank. The topic necessitates  discussion of Company Foo IP.
   Because of the urgency, Frank want to use IM. Frank must ensure:

   (a)  Only users who meet the Program X policy or Company Foo's
       intellectual property protection policy can join the IM session

   (b)  Users authenticates with an acceptable level of assurance as
       defined by the set of policies applied to the IM session

   (c)  Users present any other attributes about themselves necessary to
       verify compliance with the applicable policies.

   (d)  Users can verify who IM initiator was to an acceptable level of
       assurance as defined by the session policy

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     July 6, 2012


   (e)  Users can verify the IM data has not been tampered with to an
       acceptable level of assurance as defined by the session policy

   (f)  They can also tell the session is a Program X  session and the
       contents can only be shared with other Program X workers.

   The sequence of events Frank would use is as follows:

   (1)  Frank initiate the IM session and includes Grace as a
        participant.
   (2)  Frank's IM client allows him to select a role a role which is
        appropriate for the session. Frank then selects a Program X and
        Company Foo IP policies for the session.

   The IM client knows the protections to apply to the IM session; to
   end to end encrypt and integrity-protect the session, the level of
   assurance required for participant's identity and what participant's
   attributes are necessary to join the session.

   The IM is able to flow securely and seamlessly through existing IM
   infrastructure to session participants. Grace a session participant
   so her client attempts to join the IM session with Frank. Hank is in
   a meeting so does not join the IM session at that time.

   (5)  Grace receives the IM and sees it is a secure IM from Frank.
        Grace's client provides the attributes necessary to comply with
        the policy which includes her level 3 encryption certificate to
        the PDEP.
   (6)  Once Grace has shown she passes the policy requirements, the
        PDEP releases the IM session CEK to Grace using her level 3
        encryption certificate.
   (7)  Grace uses her smart card to open the IM session. She sees the
        from Frank is marked with both the Program X and Company Foo IP
        policies

   (8)  Grace composes a response to Frank's question and hits send

   (9)  When Hank's meeting is finished, he joins the IM session because
        he to passes the policy requirements and sees the the messages
        from Frank and Grace.

4. Plasma Data Centric Security Model

        A common theme from these scenarios is the need to closely tie
        the information asset to the set of technical controls via the
        business owners policies in such a way as it is possible to
        consistently apply the technical controls across a broad set of
        applications (not just email); for a broad set of users; (not
        just those within a organization) and in a broad set of
        environments. Assumptions based on closed world enterprise
        security models are increasingly breaking down. Perimeter
        security continues to diminish in relevance, and focus need to
        be shifted to self protecting data as opposed to protecting the
        machines that store such data. The binding between the data and
        the applicable polices needs to happen as early to creation time
        as possible so ad-hoc trust decisions are not required.  

        The delivery of the documented use cases will require the
        integration of many existing and some new protocols. In order to
        ensure the right overall direction for Plasma as each part of
        the work proceeds, a high level data model is documented here to
         act as a guide. While this is technically informative to the
        developments of each individual component, it is normative to
        the work overall.

        This Data Centric Security model is based on a well established
        set of actors for policy enforcement used elsewhere [RFC3198]
        [XACML-core]. 

4.1 Vocabulary

        These terms are the same as used by RFC3198. While the roles are
        fundamentally the same, there are some minor differences in the
        responsibilities of each actor with models such as XACML. 

        These terms are taken included for the convenience of the
        reader:


     Policy:  The policy has two basic forms. A human readable form
     which defines a set of high level requirements. These human
     readable policies may be, for example, in the form of legislation,,
     or a legal contract. These high level policies are then translated
     into technical policies for implementation. Policies may stipulate
     many forms of requirements such as data protection, access control,
     integrity, data origination, data retention, etc. 

     Policy Collection:  A collection of one or more policies. The
     policy collection may also defines the logical relationship between

     the policies  

     Policy Administration Point (PAP):  The system entity that creates,
     maintains and publishes policies or policy collections. The
     policies define the rules, their conditions and actions associated
     with the policy.

     Policy Decision and Enforcement Point (PDEP): The system entity
     that evaluates the policy criteria published by a PAP, using
     attributes supplied by a PIP to render decisions from request made
     by DRs.

     Policy Information Point (PIP): A service with issues assertions
     about subjects or the subject's environment  e.g. a SAML Security
     Token Service. This model supports both front end and back end
     exchange of assertions between the PIP and the PDEP. Attributes can
     be distributed directly between the PIP and the PDEP (Backbend
     Attribute Exchange;BAE). Alternatively attributes may be
     distributed via the DR (Front End Attribute Exchange; FAE) There
     are two types of PIP based on the types of attribute the PIP would
     assert about the subject. A Identity Provider (IdP) PIP will issue
     authentication attributes  e.g. information about how and when the
     subject authenticated to the IdP. An IdP may also issue attributes
     about the subject themselves e.g. their full name, age or
     citizenship. An attribute provider (AtP)PIP only issues attributes
     about the subject or the subject's environment.  

     Decision Requester (DR): The service responsible for making policy
     decision requests to the PDEP. In this model the policy decision is
     enforced by the PDEP by its control of cryptographic keys. The DR
     enforces any obligations the PDEP may require such as signing or
     encryption of the data, generating audit events etc. An DR is
     distinct from a Policy Enforcement Point in other models such as
     XACML in that an DR is not by default trusted with the clear text
     data. Policy enforcement is preformed by the PDEP. An DR may
     establish trust by presentation of attributes about itself and its
     environment to show it is trustworthy.  

   We additional make use of the following terms:

     Attribute Request/Issuance:  The act of a client requesting and
     obtaining a set of attributes for a subject.  The issuance of
     attributes will itself be controlled by policy and thus recursively
     embeds this same picture in that process.  For simplicity we use
     SAML as the format for both requesting and receiving attributes and
     would suggest the use of the SAML 2.0 Assertion Query and Request
     Protocol as one method for requesting the necessary attributes. 
     The attributes can be requested either by the AR (front end

     attribute exchange) or the PDEP (back end  attribute exchange).  

     Content Protection Request/Response:  The protocol to be run by the
     DR to get the set of decisions and information required to
     successfully create and encode a data block with appropriate
     labeling. This protocol is part of the work to be defined by this
     group.  

     Content Consumption Request/Response:  The protocol to be run by
     the DR to obtain the permissions and information needed to decode
     and  access a data block with appropriate labeling. This protocol
     is part of the work to be defined by this group.  

     Content Distribution:  Can be any of a number of methods by which
     the content is transmitted from the Content Creator to the Content
     Consumer.  These methods include, but are limited to: Email, FTP,
     XMPP, HTTP and SneakerNet.  

     Role:  A role is a policy collection that has an associated textual
     name.  A role in this context is not to be confused with a role in
     role-based policies, while the concepts are similar they are not
     identical.

     Role Set:  A collection of one or more roles.  

     Policy Identifier:  Is the tag that is used to identify a policy.
     For the purposes of our document we are focusing on two different
     types of policy identifiers.  Object Identifiers (OIDs) are what
     are currently used in many security policy systems and are the only
     method of policy identification supported by ESS security labels. 
     Additionally we will support URIs as policy identifiers  as they
     provide a more user friendly method of uniquely identify a policy
     and allow discovery of the policy.  

     Policy Label:  The data structure which holds one or more policy
     identifiers and their logical relationship.

     Figure 1 shoes the relationship between the actors.

  Figure 1 General Scheme for Publishing and Consuming Protected Content


   The Plasma model is applicable to any type data (Email, documents,
   databases, IM, VoIP etc). This is to facilitate consistent policy
   enforcement for data across multiple applications.  Another objective
   is to not require the data holder to have access to the plain text
   data in order to be able to make decision requests to the PDEP. The
   policy decision is complex so the content creation DR in Plasma just
   uses policy pointers  or labels to  indicate the set of policies

   applicable to content. The Content consuming DR dynamically discover
   the PDEP's who are authoritative for the decisions on protected
   content in question. The PDEP's dynamically discover the specifics of
   a policy from a PAP using the policy references. The specifics of
   policy authoring, policy decision logic modules are matters beyond
   the scope of this document. It is important to note that the actors
   in this model are logical entities and as such can be combined
   physically in different configurations. 


     o The Plasma model uses references to bind the data and the policy.
     When information is created, it is encrypted and a list of policies
     that must be enforce by the PDEP is bound to the protected data.

     o The Plasma model is an Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
     model where the ABAC policy is specified in terms of a set of
     attributes, their values and relationships. The policy may specify
     attributes about the subject, their device or environment, or
     attributes about a resource. 

     o The ABAC policy does not require the subject provide their
     orthonym.  Subjects could be anonymous or use pseudonymous. What is
     required is presentation of a set of attributes that satisfies the
     policy.

     o The requestor is required to bind the attributes to the channel
     with the PDEP to a level of assurance as required by the PDEP. If
     the PDEP only requires low assurance, bearer token over SSL would
     be suitable. If the PDEP requires higher assurance, then holder of
     key tokens over SSL would be required.

     o This model also supports Capability-Based Access Control (CBAC)
     where security tokens represent a capability to meet a policy. Once
     a subject has proven compliance with a policy, they can be issued a
     capability token. The client can subsequently  present this
     capability token in lieu of a token or tokens with the set of
     subject attributes.  The net result is the model can transition to
     a Capability Based Access Control because the capability token is
     an unforgeable token of compliance with a policy. The token can be
     used with any resource tagged with the same policy.

     o Plasma has a baseline of a secure transport between the DR and
     the PDEP. One of the decisions the PDEP has to make is the level of
     assurance on the release of the DEK to the subject. For example the
     PDEP can release a clear text DEK over the secure transport to the
     DR. Alternatively the could require the production of a high
     assurance X.509 encryption certificate as a subject attribute to
     generate an encrypted DEK.

   For the purpose of the Plasma work, it is desirable that the DR and
   PDEP be clearly defined as separate services which may be on separate
   systems.  This allows for a generalization of the model and makes it
   less dependent on any specific deployment model or policy represent,
   logic or implementation method. It also allows for a greater degree
   of control of the PDEP by an organization as all of the PDEP
   resources more directly under it's control and independent of the
   data storage location. 

   The base set of information for a Plasma client is as follows:


     o The address of one or more IdP able to issue identity attributes
     to the subject

     o A means to authenticate to the IdP(s)

     o THe address of zero or more AtP(s) able to issue attributes to
     the subject

     o The address of one or more Plasma PDEPs able to issue role tokens
     to the subject


   From this base set of data, the subject is able to authenticate to
   each Plasma PDEP in tern using the identity token from the IdP and
   discover the set of assigned roles. Each role has a set of policies
   which can be applied to data. A subject may be assigned to multiple
   roles and therefore has the ability to select the most appropriate
   role for the content being created. Once a role is selected the
   subject is able to select from the policy collection for that role.
   Role assignment is dynamic so the role discovery needs to be done on
   a regular (but not frequent) basis. Policy selection during content
   creation can be either manual or automatic. An DR may have sufficient
   context to be able to select the role and policies for the subject or
   have some rules that facilitate policy selection.  

   The model allows the content creation DR to discover the role
   assignments from multiple PDEP which would allow the subject to asset
   policies based on roles from within their organization and from any
   partner organization due to cross organization collaboration. The
   PDEP's who are authoritative for the role assignment for a subject
   may be different from the PDEP who are authoritative for enforcement
   of a policy collection in question. The DR uses the role token to
   authenticate the content creation request. The PDEP will check the
   requested list of policies for the information is a subset of the
   policies in the role token. If the set of policies are a subset of
   the policies in the role, then it will issue the metadata token to be

   attached to the protected information. 

   Policy rules processing and distribution is complex so Plasma model
   does not require policy rules to be distributed to the DR. The DR
   just uses opaque references to the policies. The references are bound
   to the content to reflect the set of policies that are applicable to
   the data in such a way as they will travel with the data.  The use of
   policy references minimizes any policy maintenance issues due to
   policy updates. The DR can be required to carry out obligations of
   the policy such as specific encryption requirements such as key size
   or algorithm; or data integrity requirements such as signing or
   creating audit records. 

   The PDEP makes its decisions based on the requested action from the
   DR, the policy requirements from the PAP and the information from the
   PIP about the subject and the subjects environment. The information
   about the subject may be exchanged direly between the PIP and the
   PDEP (Back end Attribute Exchange) or indirectly via the DR (Front
   end Attribute Exchange) or both.

   There is no guarantee that Identity and Attribute providers will
   consistently use the same name to identity a specific attributes or
   attribute data. For example they may use different schemas to
   identify an email address or use localized names to describe job
   functions or roles. These kinds of values may be standardized within
   communities of interest, but not globally across all identity and
   attribute providers.

   Figure 2 Options For Trussed Actors With Data. 

   When drawing a line where the actors in the model are full trusted
   with the clear text data there are three possibilities (see figure
   2).

   Figure 2a shows the full trust line between the user application and
   the Policy Enforcement Point(PEP). This is the model for current
   standard access control e.g. XACML [XACML-core]. In 2a, the PEP has
   full access to the clear text data. It makes decision requests to the
   PDEP and if the decision is allow the PEP releases the data to the
   application. To use fig 2a for secure Email would require every MTA
   and MUA to act as a PEP so to be fully trusted with clear text data
   which is impossible.

   Figure 2b shows the full trust line between the PDEP and the DR. In
   2b, the DR only has cipher text data. The data is encrypted with a
   content encryption key (CEK) and the PDEP has the CEK. THe PDEP
   releases the CEK to the end user application when access is granted.
   This mode is viable for secure Email as either the MTA or the MUA can
   act as a DR. 

   In figure 2c, no actor is given full trust. When the data is
   encrypted, the CEK is encrypted for each recipient just as S/MIME
   does today. The encrypted CEKs are given to the PDEP and the PDEP
   releases the encrypted  CEK when access is granted. This mode is also
   viable for secure Email as the sender can use either conventional
   Public key cryptography or Identity Based Encryption[RFC5408] to
   protect the CEK for each recipient.

   There are three ways to bind policy to data.

     o By value. This is where a copy of the machine readable rule set
     is directly associated with the data e.g. where a file system has a
     Access Control List for the file or directory or where a rights
     management agent has embedded a copy of the policy expressed in a
     policy expression language in the rights protects data. When an
     access request is made to the data, the PDEP compares the access
     request to the policy on the data itself.

     o By reference. This is where a reference to the policy is directly
     associated with the data. e.g. a URI or a URN which identifies the
     policy to be enforced or points to where the policy is published.
     For example with S/MIME the ESS label identifies the applicable
     policy by an OID. When an access request is made to the data, the
     PDEP finds the policy based on the identifier and then compares the
     access request to the referenced policy.

     o By inference. This is where the policy has a target description
     in terms of characteristics of the sets of data resources the
     policy applies to. When an access request is made, the set of
     policies are evaluated at run time to determine the set of policies
     to apply. For example when you author a XACML policy, you also
     define a target for the policy. When an access request is made to
     the data, the PDEP finds the policy using the set of attributes of
     the resource looking for any policies that match the target
     description associated with the policy. It then compares the access
     request to the identified policy.

   The chief strength of binding policy by value is its simplicity. The
   policy is local to the data can can easily and quickly be read. The
   chief weakness in binding policy by value is maintaining policy over
   time. Many policies have a multi-year life span and during the course
   of that time there is a very high probability that the policy would
   need to be updated. Given the high number of copies, it has proven to
   be an very costly and imperfect process both from an enforcement and
   audit perspective. This process is complicated by the fact that
   because only the result is stored and not an identifier, it is hard
   to identify the policy which has to be updated.

   The chief strength of binding by names is once bound to the data the
   association with the policy travels with the data. The chief weakness
   in binding by name is it requires the reference to be strongly bound
   to the data. This is possible using cryptography but then process of
   persisting the binding impacts the storage format. This can break
   backwards compatibility.

   The chief strength of binding by description is it can be applied to
   data without impacting the storage format. The chief weakness in
   binding by description is the reliability of the matching. Any
   matching process must have a false positive and falsie negative rate.
   This rate has to be evaluated on a case by case basis over time as it
   can change making compliance expensive. The set of available
   attributes also varies with different data types e.g. structured
   database information has a rich set of attributes whereas documents
   and files have a poor set of attributes. This inconsistently over
   available attributes impacts matching reliability. The resultant set
   of policies for a policy target  is also dependent on the correctness
   of the set of policies evaluated. Its also impossible to detect if a
   policy is missing from the policy store which again would mean
   incorrect policy enforcement

   This model is choosing to use binding by name because we need to
   encrypt the data which means we will impacting the storage format
   anyway which negates the main weakness of binding my name. We get the
   reliability of policy enforcement which is independent of location
   and we get low maintenance since we are only storing a reference to
   the policy and not the policy wit the data..


4.3 Content Creation Workflow

   The Content Creation DR bootstraps itself via the following sequence
   of events:

    (1) The content creation DR is configured with the set PIP's and
        PDEP's it trusts.
 


Freeman, et al.         Expires January 7, 2013                [Page 40]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     July 6, 2012


    (2) The content creation DR summits a request to all the trusted
        PDEPs for the set of roles it allows for the subject. The
        subject is authenticated and authorized for the roles via
        attributes from the PIP. The PIP attributes can be obtained by
        the PDEP either via front-end (related to the PDEP from the PIP
        via the subject) or back-end (direct exchange between the PDEP
        and the PIP) processing. 

    (3) The content creation DR receives a list of roles the PDEP can
        configured for the subject
    (4) The DR submits a request for the policy collection for each
        role. Additional attributes may be required from the PIP to
        authorize the release of the BCPC token.

   Now the DR is bootstrapped with a list of BCs and for each BC a list
   of policies associated with each BC. Now the DR is ready to create
   content. When the user wants to release protected content, they use
   the following sequence of events

    (i)   The user creates the new content
    (ii)  The user select the appropriate business context for the
          content, then selects one or more policies applicable to the
          content
    (iii) The DR encrypts the content with one or more locally generated
          CEKs
    (iv)  The DR submits the CEK, the set of requires policies to be
          applied and the hash of the encrypted content to the PDEP. THe
          CEK can be a raw key or a CEK key encrypted by a KEK if the
          user does not want the PDEP to have the ability to access the
          plain text data.
    (v)   The PDEP generates the encrypted metadata which contains the
          list of policies and the CEKs. The metadata is encrypted by
          the PDEP for itself. The PDEP includes a URL for itself and
          the hash of the protected content as authenticated attributes
          then signs the encrypted metadata. 
    (vi)  The PDEP returns the metadata to the DR
    (vii) The DR attaches the PDEP metadata to the protected content and
          distributes the content.

4.4 Content Consumption Workflow

   When a user want to open some protected content they would follow the
   following workflow.
    (A)   The DR verifies the certificate in the signed metadata then
          determines via local policy if it want to process the
          protected information based on the identity of the PDEP
    (B)   The DR verifies the signature on the metadata token and the
          binding to the encrypted data by hashing the encrypted
 


Freeman, et al.         Expires January 7, 2013                [Page 41]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     July 6, 2012


          information and comparing it to the authenticated attribute in
          the metadata
    (C)   The DR forwards the signed metadata and requests a read token
          from the PDEP using the location in the authenticated
          attribute in the metadata
    (D)   The PDEP decrypts the metadata, de-references the policy
          pointers and determines the set of access rules based on the
          policy published by the PAP. The PDEP then determines the set
          of subject attributes it needs to evaluate the access rules.
          The PDEP can the use PIP is has relationships with to query
          attributers about the subject. The list of attributes the PDEP
          is missing is then returned to the DR
    (E)   The DR obtains the missing attributes requested by the PDEP
          and sends them to the PDEP 
    (F)   Once the PDEP has a complete set of attributes, and the
          attribute values match those required under the access policy,
          the PDEP releases the CEK to the DR along with a TTL which
          defines how long the DR can use the CEK before it must discard
          the CEK and reapply for access. 
    (G)   Once the DR has the CEK it decrypts the information. It caches
          the CEK until the TTL expires.


4.5 Internet Facing Plasma Servers

   Plasma services will need to be Internet addressable to service
   requests from DR's outside the organization network. Since the Plasma
   service has sensitive cryptographic keys, it would be unwise to host
   those on an  server directly connected to the Internet. The simplest
   configuration (a) would be to have a reverse web proxy in the DMZ in
   front of the Plasma server. Since Plasma is using TLS with channel
   binding, the proxy has a limited function.  The Plasma protocol is a
   series of requestresponse messages, so it can be implemted like other
   store and forward message based services (b) e.g. SMTP, with an
   Internet facing server would terminate the TLS from the external DRs,
   ensure messages are not malformed and scan for malicious content,
   before relaying messages to a full Plasma server further inside the
   network.

4.6 Policy Types 

   Policies range from very simple to very complex. Policies have
   dependencies not only on the technical implementation of the software
   but on the range of attributes a PIP would would issue to subjects.
   This is likely constrained by the physical procedures a PIP would
   support to capture and verify the information about the subject. To
   manage this range of requirements, this model uses type types of
   policy.

4.6.1 Basic Policy

   Basic policy is intended to be universally usable by using a small
   fixed set of attributes. For example, basic policy is intended to be
   equivalent to sending encrypted Email with S/MIME today.  It is a
   simple policy that authenticated recipients of the Email get access
   to the message.  Its intended target is simple scenarios involving
   consumers and small businesses who are using public PIP which issue a
   limited set of attributes. It is expected that all Plasma clients and
   commercial IdP would be capable of supporting basic policy due to
   their simplicity and basic attribute set. 

4.6.2 Advanced Policy

 


Freeman, et al.         Expires January 7, 2013                [Page 43]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     July 6, 2012


   Advanced policy is intended to be used where one or more arbitrary 
   policies are required on the content . It is intended to target more
   complex scenarios such as content with regulated information or
   content subject to other organization and contractual policies. The
   input set of attributes is defined by the policies and can be either
   primordial or derived attributes or both. Multiple policies have a
   logical relationship e.g. they can be AND or ORed together. It is not
   expected that all Plasma clients support advances policy. 

5.  Message Protection Requirements

5.1.  General Requirements

   Protected content MUST be where the content is confidential,
   integrity protected AND provides data origination.

   Every authentication has a level of assurance associated with it
   depending on attributes such as the identity checks made about the
   subject and the authentication technology used.  The authentication
   of content creator and content consumers MUST support the multiple
   levels of identity assurance framework. (see scenarios 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
   and 3.4)

   The specifics of every possible authentication mechanism or every
   detail about how the subject's identity was proofed by the IdP cannot
   be known to the DR and PDEP, therefore the specifics of how sender or
   recipient achieve the required level of identity assurance MUST be
   abstracted from the PDEP and DR by use of a simple numeric scale (
   e,g, 0-4, or 1-6) liked to an identity assurance framework identifier
   which defines the specifics of how to derive the LoA.(See section
   3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4)

   Access policies are complex and subject to change over time.  For
   this reason, policies MUST be identified by reference rather than
   inclusion of the actual policy with the data. 

   Access to the plain text of the content MUST only be provided after
   the recipient has either provided suitable valid attributes to the
   PDEP or the PDEP was able to find attributes about recipient directly
   from a PIP,  to satisfy the policy as defined by the sender (See
   section 2.1.1)

   The sender MUST be provided with a list of policies applicable to
   content they create and scoped to their current role i.e. .what tasks
   they are currently assigned to deliver(see scenarios 3.1, 3.2, 3.3). 

   The specifics of the access control policy used by the PDEP MUST be
   abstracted from both the sender and recipients i.e. the DR MUST NOT

   make the access control decision or need specifics of the access
   policy(see scenarios 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4).

   Content consumers DR MUST receive authenticated attributes of the
   identity of the creator, the level of identity assurance of the
   creator and the cryptographic fingerprint of the original content  so
   the DR can confirm who created the content and that the content has
   not been altered (see section 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4)

   The key exchange between content creator and content consumer and the
   PDEP MUST support multiple levels of assurance so an appropriate
   strength of mechanism can be selected based on the level of assurance
   required. For example, for low assurance situations this could be via
   a plan text CEK over a secure transport such as SSL.  For high
   assurance situations recipient MAY be required to provide a suitable
   key exchange key such as an X.509 certificate to encrypt the CEK. 
   (See scenarios 3.3 and 3.4)

   The level of key exchange assurance requited MUST be selected by the
   sender and enforced by the PDEP (See section 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4). 

   If the content consumers  is unable to initially comply with the
   content creators policy, they MUST be able resolve any issues by
   getting the suitable credentials or attributes and gain access to the
   content without intervention from the content creator.

   A time-to-live MUST be provided to content consumers when access is
   granted by the PDEP to define when the DR MUST discard the message
   CEK and submit a new access request to the PDEP. The TTL value MUST
   be based on the message policy and optional attributes about the
   content consumer and their environment.

   The PDEP MUST be stateless for processing policy requests from
   content creators and consumers with respect to any instance of
   protected content. It MUST be possible to have multiple instances of
   a PDEP service and load balance requests across all instances of the
   service transparently to the client and not require synchronization
   of state about requests between instances of the service.

   A PDEP MUST be capable of generating audit events associated with
   access to protected content.

5.1.1 Email Specific General Requirements 

   It MUST be possible for domains to publish keys for boundary
   inspection agents.  This allows senders to pre-authorize these agents
    for access to the message.  It MUST be possible for boundary
   inspection agents to request access to protected messages which have

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     July 6, 2012


   not been preauthorized by the sender. 

   It MUST be possible for MTAs to request access to protected messages
   which have not been preauthorized by the sender (see section 3.5).

5.2.  Basic Policy Requirements

   The use of Basic Policy MUST be backwards compatible with existing
   S/MIME.  A sender's agent MAY discover some recipient's certificates 
   and create recipient info structures using the existing standard
   (unless specifically forbidden by the selected policy).  A sender's
   agent MAY elect to use this mechanism for recipients for whom keys   
     cannot be discovered. 

   One Basic Policy is to be defined by this work.  The Basic to map to
   NIST 800-63-1.  This process does not preclude other Basic Policies
   to be defined by other groups or even within the context of the
   IETF.


   When using Basic Policy, the sending agent MUST define which basic
   policy and the list of recipients.

   Basic policy MUST support multiple levels of identity assurance.  The
   levels of identity assurance MUST map to an existing identity
   authentication assurance framework e.g. to NIST 800-63-1 or
   equivalent. need rewording to multiple basic policies

   A sender using Basic policy MUST be able to send protected messages
   without discovering any recipient's encryption key.

   Using basic policy MUST NOT require bilateral agreements between
   sender and recipients a priori to sending the message.

5.2.1 Email Specific Basic Policy Requirements 

   The use of Basic Policy MUST be backwards compatible with existing
   S/MIME.

   A sender's agent MAY discover some recipient's certificates and
   create recipient info structures as per the existing S/MIME standard
   and elect to use the new mechanism for recipients it cannot discover
   keys for rather than remove the recipient's without certificates.

5.3.  Advanced Policy Requirements

   It MUST be possible to apply one or more Advanced Policies to a
   protected content.  Where 2 or more policies are applied to protected

   content, the logical relationship between the policies MUST also be
   expressed i.e. are the policies a logical AND or a logical OR. (See
   section 3.3)

   An advanced policy MAY require attributes about:

   o  The content consumer
   o  The device the content consumer is using
   o  The environment of the device is attempting to access the
        protected content from

   Advances policy MUST support an extensible list of obligations on the
   content creator where use of the policy requires some specific action
   on the part of the content creator e.g. sign content with 2 factor
   smart card and/or that the signature is legally binding, or the
   message needs to be verified for an extended period(see scenarios 3.3
   and 3.4).

   Advanced policies must support the ability to verify the content for
   an extended period (10 or more years)

7.  Security Considerations

   Authentication by itself is not a good trust indicator for users.
   Authentication raises the level of assurance the identity is correct
   but does not address whether the identity is trustworthy or
   noteworthy to the recipient.  Authentication should be coupled with
   some form of reputation e.g. the domain is on a white list or is not
   or a black list.  Malicious actors may attempt to "legitimize" a
   message if an indication of authentication is not coupled with some
   form of reputation.

   Malicious actors could attempt to use encrypted Email as a way to
   bypass existing message pipeline controls or to mine information from
   a domain.  Domain should have sufficient granularity of policy to
   handle situations where their Email pipeline agents have not been
   authorized to inspect the contents.

   It must be possible for a third party to, upon correctly presenting a
   legitimate legal justification, to recover the content of a message.
   This includes the Sender's and Recipient's companies for business
   continuity purposes, as well as Law Enforcement.  If the entity
   requesting the information and the entity controlling the access are
   in different jurisdictions, then the process would be subject to some
   form of rendition.

   The use of a security label type that requires the recipient of a
   message to query a PDEP in order to obtain the contents of a message
   opens an additional method for adversaries to confirm that an Email
   address does or does not exist. Additionally it allows for a new
   channel for materials to be delivered to the recipient's mail
   processor that is not checked for malware or viruses by the standard
   mail scanning methods in place.  For these reasons recipient
   processing systems need to implement the following counter-measures:

     1)  The pointer to the PDEP MUST be checked against some policy
     before attempting to query the PDEP for a policy decision. 2)  Care
     MUST be taken when processing the responses from a PDEP check that
     they are well-formed and meet local policy before using the
     responses.

Editorial Comments

   [anchor21]  JLS: Are these really the terms that we want to be using?
               I normally use data origination rather than
               authenticated.  It would be assumed that the data
               origination is being attested to by a middle man for a
               sender w/o signature capability rather than
               authentication being a correct term.

   [anchor22]  JLS: We need to talk about what operation you are getting
               this level of assurance for. and who you are
               authenticating to.

   [anchor23]  JLS: Same text should apply for senders?

   [anchor24]  JLS: What does assurance level mean here?  Are we talking
               about security levels or authentication levels or
               something else?  Are levels required to define a set of
               requirements.  I.e. An assurance level defines:
               Authentication requirements, confidentiality requirements
               (other).
