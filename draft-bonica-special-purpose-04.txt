Abstract

   This memo instructs IANA to restructure its IPv4 and IPv6 Special-
   Purpose Address Registries.  Upon restructuring, the aforementioned
   registries will record all special-purpose address blocks,
   maintaining a common set of information regarding each address block.

   This memo updates RFC 5736 and RFC 4773, which define the current
   structure of the IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registries.
   It also obsoletes RFC 5735 and RFC 5156 which document special-
   purpose address blocks that are not currently, but will in the
   future, be recorded in the IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address
   Registries.

Internet-Draft     Special-Purpose Address Registries      December 2012


1.  Introduction

   In order to support new protocols and practices, the IETF
   occasionally reserves an address block a for special purpose.  For
   example, [RFC1122] reserves an IPv4 address block (0.0.0.0/8) to
   represent the local (i.e., "this") network.  Likewise, [RFC4291]
   reserves an IPv6 address block (fe80::/10) to represent link-scoped
   unicast addresses.

   Periodically, the IETF publishes an RFC that catalogs special-purpose
   address blocks.  Currently, [RFC5735] catalogs all IPv4 special-
   purpose address blocks and [RFC5156] catalogs all IPv6 special-
   purpose address blocks.

   [RFC5736] assigns an IPv4 address block (192.0.0.0/24) to IANA and
   instructs IANA to allocate special-purpose address blocks from this
   space.  [RFC5736] also instructs IANA to create an IPv4 Special-
   Purpose Address Registry that records allocations from this address
   space.  However, [RFC5736] does not instruct IANA to record special-
   purpose address block reservations from outside of the aforementioned
   space in the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry.

   Likewise, [RFC2928] assigns an IPv6 address block (2001:0000::/23) to
   IANA and instructs IANA to allocate special-purpose address blocks
   from this space.  [RFC4773] instructs IANA to create an IPv6 Special-
   Purpose Address Registry that records allocations from this address
   space.  However, [RFC4773] does not instruct IANA to record special-
   purpose address block reservations from outside of the aforementioned
   space in the IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry.

   This memo instructs IANA to restructure its IPv4 and IPv6 Special-
   Purpose Address Registries.  Therefore, this document updates
   [RFC5736] and [RFC4773] which define the current structure of the
   aforementioned registries.

   Specifically, this memo instructs IANA to record all special-purpose
   address blocks in the aforementioned registries.  These include, but
   are not limited to, IPv4 allocations from 192.0.0.0/24 and IPv6
   allocations from 2001:0000::/23.  When the aforementioned registries
   include all special-purpose address blocks, [RFC5735] and [RFC5156]
   will become redundant with the registries.  Therefore, this memo
   obsoletes [RFC5735] and [RFC5156].

   Furthermore, this memo defines:

   o  a common set of information that the registries will maintain
      regarding each special-purpose address block

Internet-Draft     Special-Purpose Address Registries      December 2012


   o  a common set of requirements for future entries


2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will restructure the following registries:

   o  IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry

   o  IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry

   The IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry will record all IPv4
   special-purpose address blocks.  These reservations will include, but
   not be limited to, allocations from the 192.0.0.0/24 address block.
   Likewise, the IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry will record all
   IPv6 special-purpose address blocks.  These reservations will
   include, but not be limited to, allocations from the 2001:0000::/23
   address block.

   Section 2.1 of this document describes information that both
   registries will maintain for each entry.  Initially, IANA will
   populate the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry with information
   taken from Section 2.2 of this document.  Likewise, IANA will
   populate the IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry with information
   taken from Section 2.3 of this document.

   IANA will update the aforementioned registries as requested in the
   "IANA Considerations" section of an IETF reviewed document.  The
   "IANA Considerations" section must include all of the information
   specified in Section 2.1 of this document.

2.1.  Information Requirements

   The IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registries will maintain
   the following information regarding each entry:

   o  Prefix - An IPv4 or IPv6 prefix that identifies the special-
      purpose address block

   o  Name - A descriptive name for the special-purpose address block

   o  RFC - The RFC though which the special-purpose address block was
      requested

   o  Allocation Date - The date upon which the special purpose address
      block was allocated

Internet-Draft     Special-Purpose Address Registries      December 2012


   o  Termination Date - The date upon which the allocation is to be
      terminated.  This field is applicable for limited-use allocations
      only.

   o  Source - A boolean value indicated whether an address from the
      allocated special-purpose address block is valid when used as the
      source address of an IP datagram that transits two devices

   o  Destination - A boolean value indicated whether an address from
      the allocated special-purpose address block is valid when used as
      the destination address of an IP datagram that transits two
      devices

   o  Routable - A boolean value indicating whether a IP datagram whose
      destination address is drawn from the allocated special-purpose
      address block is routable (i.e., may traverse more than a single
      IP interface)

   o  Global - A boolean value indicating whether a IP datagram whose
      destination address is drawn from the allocated special-purpose
      address block is routable beyond a specified administrative
      domain.

   o  Reserved - A boolean value indicatating whether the special-
      purpose address block is reserved by IP, itself.  This value is
      "TRUE" if the RFC that created the special-purpose address block
      requires all compliant IP implementations to behave in a special
      way when forwarding packets either to or from addresses contained
      by the address block.

   If the value of "Destination" is FALSE, the values of "Routable" and
   "Global" must also be false.

2.2.  IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry Entries

   Table 1 though Table 16, below, represent entries with which the IANA
   will initially populate the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry.

3.  Security Considerations

   Security of the Internet's routing system relies on the ability to
   authenticate an assertion of unique control of an address block.
   Measures to authenticate such assertions rely on validation that the
   address block forms part of an existing allocated address block, and
   that there is a trustable and unique reference in the IANA address
   registries.

   The proposed registry is intended to provide an authoritative source
   of information regarding the currency and intended purpose of special
   purpose address blocks that are designated from the IANA-administered
   Special Purpose registry.  This is a small step towards the creation

Internet-Draft     Special-Purpose Address Registries      December 2012


   of a comprehensive registry framework that can be used as a trust
   point for commencing a chain of address validation.  Consideration
   should be given to IANA registry publication formats that are machine
   parseable, and also the use of file signatures and associated
   certificate mechanisms to allow applications to confirm that the
   registry contents are current, and that they have been published by
   the IANA.
