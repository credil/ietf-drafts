 TRILL: Support of IEEE 802.1Qbb, 802.1Qaz, and Congestion Notification
               <draft-eastlake-trill-rbridge-dcb-04.txt>


Abstract

   IEEE 802.1 has developed standards as part of its Data Center
   Bridging (DCB) activity to (1) efficiently minimize data loss due to
   queue overflow for selected classes of traffic within Local Area
   Networks (LANs) meeting certain conditions and (2) provide means to
   allocate the available bandwidth on links to different classes of
   traffic. These standards are now in IEEE Std 802.1Qbb-2011, IEEE Std
   802.1Qaz-2011, and the Congestion Notificaiton freature in IEEE Std
   802.1Q-2011.

   This document briefly explains these standards and discusses the
   support of these IEEE 802 standards in TRILL switches (devices that
   implement the IETF TRILL protocol standard).

1. Introduction

   IEEE 802.1 has developed various standards as part of its Data Center
   Bridging (DCB) activity. The intent of three of these standards is
   (1) to efficiently eliminate data loss due to queue overflow for
   selected classes of traffic within Local Area Networks (LANs) meeting
   certain conditions and (2) to provide limited means to allocate the
   available bandwidth to different classes of traffic. Those three
   standardes are Priority Based Flow Control (the IEEE [802.1Qbb]
   standard), Enhanced Tramission Selection (the IEEE [802.1Qaz]
   standard), and the Congestion Notification (CN) feature in the IEEE
   [802.1Q] standard.  Intended uses include the support of loss
   sensitive services, such as Fiber Channel over Ethernet [FCoE], in
   data centers.  Because they are primarily implemented at the port
   level, no changes in the TRILL protocol are required to support IEEE
   802.1Qbb or 802.1Qaz. To support 802.1Qau, minor changes to TRILL are
   required as specified herein.

   The existing optional PAUSE feature of IEEE 802.3 (Annex 31B of
   [802.3]) can, with appropriate engineering, also provide Ethernet
   service without loss of frames due to queue overflow. However, PAUSE
   has problems as follows:

   1. Traffic for some protocols, for example TCP [RFC793], requires
      frame losses to signal congestion for flow control. Elimination of
      frame drops due to congestion would prevent TCP flow control,
      unless some other mechanism were added.

   2. Some traffic consists of time critical network control frames, for
      example IS-IS Hellos [IS-IS]. PAUSE is relatively indiscriminant
      and pauses such frames, except for some MAC Control frames such as
      PAUSE control frames themselves, along with any less critical
      traffic.  Pausing such critical network control frames can
      compromise transport connectivity.

   3. PAUSE can result in intermittent waves of spreading traffic
      paralysis, crippling network throughput, as follows: When a switch
      S1 receives a PAUSE on a port P1 and can no longer transmit frames
      out that port it is likely that output queues to P1 will fill up
      quickly. As soon as one output queue to P1 is full or almost so
      then, to avoid frame loss, S1 must send PAUSE frames out on each
      of its ports that might receive a frame for output to P1. For
      example, it might have to PAUSE input on P2 through P9,
      unnecessarily blocking traffic between any pair of those ports, to
      be sure it will not receive input on any of them for P1. This can
      repeat in switches connected to S1, switches connected to switches
      connected to S1, etc.

1.1 Overview of These Standards

   Overviews of the three DCB standards covered herein are given below.
   IEEE 802.1 has specified theses standards and the behavior needed to
   support them in bridges and end stations. This document discusses the
   support of these standards in TRILL switches (commonly called
   RBridges [RFC6325]).

   IEEE [802.1Qbb], Priority-based Flow Control (PFC), provides a frame
   priority based refinement of the Ethernet PAUSE feature as described
   in Section 2. To the extent that a switch implements separate queues
   for different priorities at each port, this can eliminate the first
   and second of the PAUSE problems listed above. Traffic requiring
   frame drops due to congestion can be assigned a priority for which
   PFC is not enabled. PFC is not normally enabled for the two highest
   priorities, 6 and 7, which are typically used for time sensitive
   control frames. PFC also reduces the third problem as any congestion
   spreading would affect only priorities with PFC enabled.

   IEEE [802.1Qaz] is a standard covering two things: One, Enhanced
   Transmission Selection (ETS), allocates bandwidth between traffic
   class groups indicated by priority. It is described in Section 3.
   Second, 802.1Qaz contains the specification of the Data Center
   Bridging Exchange Protocol (DCBX) for discovering and configuring the
   three standards that this document covers, as described in Section 4.

   Congestion Notification (CN), formerly IEEE 802.1Qau, provides
   signaling of congestion on a per flow basis to the end station source
   of the flow. It was adopted as an amendment to IEEE 802.1Q-2005 and
   has been rolled into [802.1Q]. As a part of CN, participating end
   stations are required to implement per flow rate limiting. CN is
   enabled on a per priority basis and, with appropriate engineering,
   minimizes frame drops due to queue overflow in a LAN Congestion
   Notification Domain within which all switches and end stations
   implement it. CN and 802.1Qbb Priority-Based Flow Control (PFC)
   complement each other to help eliminate such frame drops. CN reducse
   congestion by proactively reducing frame ingress rates at the source
   end station(s) involved in the congestion. For some congestion cases
   this may be insufficient to stop buffer overflow at a congestion
   point. PFC provides an emergency brake for such cases and avoids
   frame loss. CN eliminates the first problem listed above for PAUSE in
   that frames that require drops due to congestion for flow control can
   be assigned a priority for which CN is not enabled. CN avoids the
   second problem because it is not normally used to limit priorities 6
   and 7, which are typically used for time sensitive control frames.
   And CN avoids the third problem listed above for PAUSE because it
   acts by restraining end station flow sources rather than blocking
   transmission on intermediate switch ports. Section 5 below provides
   additional information on CN and specifies additions to the TRILL
   protocol to support it.

   These three DCB standards may be implemented independently or in any
   combination except that implementation of any of them implies
   implementation of DCBX, specified in IEEE [802.1Qaz].

2. Priority-Based Flow Control

   IEEE [802.1Qbb], Priority-Based Flow Control (PFC), refines the IEEE
   [802.3] PAUSE feature to permit separately requesting, on a physical
   Ethernet link, pausing and unpausing the traffic of each of the eight
   available frame priority levels. The actual priority-based pause
   Ethernet control frame is specified in IEEE [802.3bd].

   Such queue pausing occurs within the transmission logic associated
   with a port and requires no changes to the TRILL protocol, which is
   implemented above such port logic, as described in [RFC6325].
   LLDP/DCBX is used in PFC discovery and agreement with peers as
   described in Section 4. A TRILL switch implementing the PFC standard
   MUST implement DCBX, signaling PFC support and configuration.
   Guarantee of lossless handling of frames with a particular priority
   in a TRILL campus requires implementation and enablement of PFC for
   that priority at all end stations that originate frames and all TRILL
   switches and bridges in that campus as well as meeting the PFC
   engineering requirements in [802.1Qbb].

   The PFC control frames specified in [802.3bd] are MAC control frames
   that are not VLAN tagged. Their transmission normally bypasses the
   output queue at a port so they are transmitted immediately, or as
   soon as the frame currently being transmitted is sent, so as to meet
   the timing requirements of PFC.

3. Enhanced Transmission Selection

   Enhanced Transmission Selection (ETS), specified in IEEE [802.1Qaz],
   allocates bandwidth, between traffic classes, through each of the
   ports of a switch or end station. (To be more precise, it modifies
   the algorithm used to select, from multiple priority-based output
   queues at a port, the next frame to transmit. Provision is made for
   proprietary algorithms and 802.1 has also specified an algorithm in
   connection with precise frame timing (AVB), but we are only concerned
   with the default DCB algorithm.)

   Transmission selection occurs within the logic associated with a port
   and requires no changes to the TRILL protocol, which is implemented
   above such port logic, as described in [RFC6325]. A TRILL switch
   implementing the ETS standard MUST implement DCBX (see Section 4)
   signaling of ETS support and configuration. For ETS to be effective,
   traffic in different ETS groups cannot share an output queue.

4. The DCB Exchange Protocol

   The DCB Exchange Protocol (DCBX) is specified in IEEE [802.1Qaz],
   which also specifies ETS as described in Section 3.

   DCBX is built on the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), which is
   specified in IEEE [802.1AB]. DCBX is used for the discovery of DCB
   capabilities of peer switches, for the detection of inconsistent
   configuration of DCB features between peer switches, and for the
   propagation of DCB features to switches configured to accept
   configuration via DCBX. For purposes of TRILL protocol peering, TRILL
   switches ignore intervening bridges, but for the purposes of LLDP and
   DCBX all stations, including TRILL switches, 802.1 bridges, and end
   stations are considered peers.

   TRILL switches implementing any of the three DCB protocols MUST also
   implement DCBX.

5. Congestion Notification

   Congestion Notification (CN) can limit flows to minimize frame loss
   by having congestion points that detect congestion send Congestion
   Notification Messages (CNMs) back to reaction points in end stations
   that can limit flows. See [802.1Q] for the specification of the CN
   algorithms to perform at congestion and reaction points.  Congestion
   Notification is designed to operate best in minimizing frame loss of
   unicast flows in a LAN composed of point-to-point physical links
   where all switches have implemented Congestion Notification.

   A TRILL switch that implements Congestion Notification may act as an
   end point, for example when sourcing or sinking SNMP management
   frames, and thus may contain one or more reaction points, as well as
   implementing congestion points at its output queues.

   Reaction points are in end stations where flows originate and are the
   mechanism to limit flows. The granularity of reaction points is
   beyond the scope of CN and this document but cannot be larger than a
   priority at a MAC address. If the granularity is smaller and there
   are multiple reaction points in an end station for a given priority,
   then the end station must label outgoing frames with a Congestion
   Notification tag (CNtag) that includes an end station flow ID. This
   flow ID is an opaque field to the rest or the network.

              Figure 1: Native Ethernet Frame in a CN Domain


   Congestion points are at queues in forwarding devices, normally port
   output queues. The functions of a congestion point are (1) to
   conditionally send Congestion Notification Messages (CNMs) to the
   source of a frame and (2) to conditionally strip Congestion
   Notification tags (CNtags) out of a frame being forwarded, for
   example if it is being forwarded out of a congestion notifiation
   domain.

   When a frame is to be inserted into an output queue with a congestion
   point, the procedures specified in IEEE [802.1Q] are used to
   determine if a CNM should be sent to the frame's source and if so to
   determine various fields in that CNM. When a frame is to be inserted


D. Eastlake, et al                                             [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT                           TRILL: Qbb, Qaz, and CN Support


   into an output queue with a congestion point, the congestion point
   may remove any CNtag in the frame as discussed in Section 5.1.
   Congestion points are implemented within the logic associated with a
   port and require no changes to TRILL for the output of native frames,
   as TRILL is implemented above such port logic as described in
   [RFC6325]; however, when outputting a TRILL Data frame, any CNM
   generated needs to be for the TRILL encapsulated frame rather than
   for the entire TRILL Data frame. In that case there are some
   differences between the details of the creation of a CNM at an TRILL
   switch output port and at a bridge output port. This CNM also needs
   to be TRILL encapsulated but this will happen automatically as the
   CNM is specified by [802.1Q] to be treated as a native frame arriving
   at the port.

   Within a contiguous part of the TRILL campus where Congestion
   Notification is enabled (see Section 5.1), you would see the same
   frames with the same tags as in a similar bridged LAN except that
   those frames will be TRILL encapsulated as shown in Figures 3 and 4.
   The exception is when a TRILL-ignorant bridge within the campus
   produces a CNM in response to a TRILL data frame as shown in Figure
   6. The resulting CNM is corrected by the first TRILL switch it
   encounters, which will be the previous-hop TRILL switch.

5.1 Congestion Notification Domains

   Congestion Notification (CN) reduces frame drops due to output queue
   overflow in a Congestion Notification Domain. There could be many
   such domains, each specified for a particular priority and contiguous
   set of network stations (end stations, TRILL switches, or bridges),
   within a TRILL campus. For example, two Congestion Notification
   Domains, one at priority X and one at priority Y, could cover the
   same set of contiguous stations, overlapping but different sets of
   such stations, or completely disjoint sets of such stations, in a
   campus.

   CN includes mechanisms to "defend" Congestion Notification Domains,
   that is, make sure only congestion managed flows of frames enter
   congestion point queues. The edge of a domain, i.e. the set of
   station ports in the domain directly connected to a station not in

   the domain, is determined by a combination of auto-detection using
   LLDP (see Section 4) and management configuration. Bridges that
   implement Congestion Notification defend a domain by the following:

   1. Prohibiting priority mapping inside the domain.

   2. Mapping the priority of any frame entering the domain from a
      station outside the domain to a priority that is not a congestion
      managed priority.

   3. Prohibiting the mapping of the priority of any frame entering the
      domain from a station outside the domain to the domain's priority.

   The station containing the reaction-point-equipped source of a flow
   must be part of a Congestion Notification Domain at the flow's
   priority along with all stations along the path to the flow's
   destination and all of the queues involved with the flow must be
   congestion-point-equipped in order for CN to be able to meet its
   goals.

   Because of item 2 in the list above, a station can be a member of no
   more than 7 different Congestion Notification Domains because there
   must be at least one priority that is not congestion managed for use
   as the mapped priority of entering frames from outside the domain and
   which are therefore not part of a congestion managed flow. As a
   practical matter, it is unlikely that a station would be a member of
   more than 4 or 5 different Congestion Notification Domains as
   priorities 6 and 7 are normally used for high priority control frames
   that are not congestion controlled and at least one low priority is
   kept non-congestion managed for mapping as above.

   The per port per priority state of a switch or end station will be
   one of the following four values, which have the effects indicated:

   o  Disabled:
      -  On native frame input, frame priority can be mapped to or from
         this priority.
      -  If this is an end-station output port, CNtags are not added.
      -  If this is a switch output port, CNtags are not stripped.

   o  Edge:
      -  On native frame input, a frame with this priority is mapped to
         a non-CN priority and no native frame can be mapped to this
         priority, regardless of the priority-mapping table at the port.
         For TRILL Data frames, this also applies to the Inner.VLAN
         priority.
      -  If this is an end-station output port, CNtags are not added.
      -  If this is a switch output port, CNtags are stripped including
         any CNtag in the encapsulated frame if a TRILL Data frame is
         being output.

INTERNET-DRAFT                           TRILL: Qbb, Qaz, and CN Support


   o  Interior:
      -  On frame input, a frame in this priority is not mapped to
         another priority and no frame can be mapped to this priority,
         regardless of the priority-mapping table at this port.  For
         TRILL Data frames, this also applies to the Inner.VLAN
         priority.
      -  If this is an end-station output port, CNtags are not added.
      -  If this is a switch output port, CNtags are strippedd including
         any CNtag in the encapsulated frame if a TRILL Data frame is
         being output.

   o  InteriorReady:
      -  On frame input, a frame in this priority is not mapped to
         another priority and no frame can be mapped to this priority,
         regardless of the priority-mapping table at this port.  For
         TRILL Data frames, this also applies to the Inner.VLAN
         priority.
      -  If this is an end-station output port, CNtags may be added.
      -  If this is a switch output port, CNtags are not stripped.

   Note that when the priority of a TRILL encapsulated frame is mapped,
   the priority field in the Inner.VLAN tag MUST be changed.



5.2 Congestion Notification Tag Details

   An end station originating a native frame may add a Congestion
   Notification tag (CNtag) to identify the native frame's reaction
   point in that end station, if the end station and the next hop device
   are part of a Congestion Notification Domain. A CNtag is 4 bytes
   long, consisting of a 2 bytes Ethertype (0x22E9) followed by a 2
   bytes flow ID, and appears after any VLAN tag but before the frame
   body. This CNtag flow ID is an opaque quantity only meaningful to the
   originating end station. The inclusion of a CNtag is optional as the
   originating end station may be able to identify the corresponding
   reaction point from other information returned in a Congestion
   Notification Message such as the priority.

   As described in Section 5.3, CNtags are always added to Congestion
   Notification Messages (CNM) when they are created.



5.3 Congestion Notification Message Details

   A Congestion Notification Message (CNM) is, under certain
   circumstances, created by a congestion point, as described in IEEE
   [802.1Q], when a frame is entered into the queue associated with that
   congestion point. The CNM frame always includes a Congestion


D. Eastlake, et al                                             [Page 14]

INTERNET-DRAFT                           TRILL: Qbb, Qaz, and CN Support


   Notification tag (CNtag, see Section 5.2). The CNtag includes a zero
   flow ID if the frame provoking the CNM did not have a CNtag. The body
   of the CNM itself, after the CNtag, starts with the CNM Ethertype
   (0x22E7) followed by the information below:

      -  CNM version information, currently zero
      -  Quantized congestion feedback information as specified in
         [802.1Q]
      -  An 8 byte opaque ID of the congestion point generating the CNM
      -  The priority of the frame causing the CNM
      -  The destination MAC address of the frame causing the CNM
      -  The number of bytes included from the beginning of the body of
         the frame causing the CNM
      -  The first up to 64 bytes of the body of the frame causing the
         CNM

   Except that input bytes/frame counters are not incremented, a CNM
   generated at an output queue for a port is treated as if it had been
   received on that port. CNMs are considered to be in the same VLAN as
   the frame that provoked them and have configurable priority that
   defaults to priority 6.

   It is undesirable, but not an error, for a CNM to be sent in response
   to a CNM frame which encounters congestion. This is normally avoided
   by sending CNM frames with a priority which does not have congestion
   notification enabled.

   As described in Section 5.4.1.3 below, when a CNM is generated by an
   TRILL switch when queuing a TRILL data frame, it is generated for the
   enclosed frame, not for the entire TRILL data frame. This will cause
   the CNM to be addressed to the source end station of the data.



5.4 Additions to TRILL to Support Congestion Notification

   The figure below is used in the discussion in this section. The
   assumption is that a frame is generated at End Station "a" (ESa)
   destined for End Station "b" (ESb) and this frame is forwarded
   through the sequence of 802.1 bridges (Bn) and TRILL switches
   (RBridges, RBn) shown. For native frames from ESa, RB1 acts as the
   ingress TRILL switch, encapsulating and directing them to egress
   TRILL switch RB3 for decapsulation and delivery to ESb. The arrows
   indicate the flow of a data frame. Any resulting CNM would flow in
   the opposite direction; however, such a CNM would be independently
   routed towards ESa and would not be constrained to follow the same
   sequence of switches shown below.

   TRILL can make no change to the actions at any reaction points in ESa
   or any congestion points at the output queues of B1, B2, or B3, since
   they are not TRILL switches. Any CNM generated at B2 will be in
   response to a TRILL frame and will need to be corrected by the
   previous hop TRILL switch. The situation at the output queue of RB3
   is actually the same as B3 since, as egress, RB3 will have
   decapsulated any traffic for ESb before it tries to insert it in an
   output queue. Thus the frame RB3 is enqueuing will be a native frame,
   a congestion point at the RB3 output can act, for such a frame,
   exactly as an IEEE 802.1 congestion point, and any CNM generated in
   the RB3 output from that native frame will be treated as if it was
   received by the RB3 port.

   A CNM created at the RB1 or RB2 output queue is straightforward.
   Assume the CNM is created in response to TRILL Data frame 1 (TDF1)
   and the TDF1 encapsulates native frame 1 (NF1). The CNM would be
   created as a TRILL encapsulated CNM with the ingress TRILL switch of
   NF1 as its egress. The Inner.MacDA would be ESa. The Inner.MacSA
   would be the MAC address of the port on which the TRILL encapsulated
   CNM was initially sent, that is, the same as the Outer.MacSA. The
   encapsulated CNM itself would be filled in as if in response to NF1,
   not TDF1.

   Similarly, a CNM created at B3 would have ESa as its destination
   address and would be TRILL encapsulated when it arrived at RB3 as RB3
   would be its ingress TRILL switch.



5.4.1 TRILL Switch Ingress Details

   This section specifies special actions for CN at a TRILL switch input
   port receiving a native frame, that is, the TRILL switch ingress
   function. The usual processing on the priority of the input TRILL
   data frame, modified as described in Section 5.1, is done. Special
   actions are required only when the native frame received is a CNM.



D. Eastlake, et al                                             [Page 16]

INTERNET-DRAFT                           TRILL: Qbb, Qaz, and CN Support


   The ingress process at a TRILL switch, say RB2, supporting CN MUST
   detect the case of a native CNM created by a bridge in response to a
   TRILL frame, say by B2 in Figure 4, and transform or discard it as
   described below. If such a CNM was generated in response to a TRILL
   control (IS-IS) frame, it is discarded. No other changes are needed
   in the TRILL switch ingress process.

   A native CNM requiring special actions is easily recognized on
   ingress as it's MAC destination address will be the TRILL switch and
   it will have the CNM Ethertype. (A CNM not addressed to the TRILL
   switch must have been generated in response to an unencapsulated
   native frame, for example at B3 in the diagram above, and can be
   encapsulated by its Ingress TRILL switch and generally forwarded by
   transit TRILL switches in the same way as other native frame.)

   Such a native CNM resulting from a TRILL data frame at B2 has the
   contents generally shown in Figure 6 and listed further below.

             the same field (#9) in the CNM tag received due to dropping
             the TRILL Header (8 bytes), MAC addresses (12 bytes), and
             Inner.VLAN (4 bytes).

   Because of the reduction in the number of bytes of the body of the
   frame that would have caused the CNM if it weren't TRILL
   encapsulated, it is RECOMMENDED that bridges and TRILL switches
   implementing Congestion Notification in a TRILL campus be configured
   to include the maximum (64) number of bytes when generating a CNM.



5.4.2 Transit TRILL Switch Details

   The subsections below describe transit TRILL switch support of
   Congestion Notification at input and output ports. As this is a TRILL

   switch in its transit role, only the handling of TRILL Data frames is
   discussed. If the TRILL switch is receiving a native frame, it will
   be an ingress as described in Section 5.4.2 and if it is sending a
   native frame, it will be an egress as described in Section 5.4.3.
   However, this section does apply to the output of an encapsulated
   frame that was ingressed at a TRILL switch and to the input, in TRILL
   encapsulated form, of a frame to be egressed at a TRILL switch.



5.4.2.1 Transit TRILL Switch Input Port

   The usual 802.1Q processing on the priority of the input TRILL data
   frame, modified as described in Section 5.1, is done.



5.4.2.2 Transit TRILL Switch Output Port

   As discussed in Section 5.1, a CNtag is stripped under some
   circumstances; however, such a CNtag will appear as part of the
   encapsulated frame, not on the outside of the TRILL data frame, so
   the CNtag is stripped from deeper in the frame.  When there is a
   Congestion Point enabled at a TRILL switch output queue, a CNM is not
   generated as the result of trying to queue a TRILL control (IS-IS)
   frame for output at a TRILL switch port. A TRILL encapsulated CNM is
   generated in response to a TRILL Data frame composed as below, when
   to do so is specified by [802.1Q]. The TRILL Data frame causing the
   CNM is referred to as TDF1 and its encapsulated native frame as NF1.

      + Outer.MacDA - MAC address of the next hop RBridge towards the
        egress nickname used in the TRILL Header (see below)
      + Outer.MacSA - MAC address of the output port on which the TRILL
        encapsulated CNM is to be sent
      + Outer.VLAN - Designated VLAN of the link on which the TRILL
        encapsulated CNM is to be sent
      + TRILL Header

           o Flags, hop count, options length
           o Egress nickname, from ingress nickname in TDF1
           o Ingress nickname, a nickname of the RBridge generating the
             CNM

        source MAC address of NF1
      + Inner.MacSA - same as Outer.MacSA of TDF1
      + Inner.VLAN - same as the Inner.VLAN of TDF1, that is, the VLAN
        tag of NF1
      + CNtag - with flow ID from the CNtag of NF1 or zero if NF1 did
        not have a CNtag

5.4.3 TRILL Switch Egress Details

   After decapsulation, processing of the decapsulated native frame is
   the same as at any CN equipped output port. As discussed in Section
   5.1, any CNtag present is stripped under some circumstances. If the
   output queue is congested, then a native CNM may be generated in
   response to the decapsulated native frame. This native CNM will then
   be treated as if it had been received on the port.
