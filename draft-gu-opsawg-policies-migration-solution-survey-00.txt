   Policies and dynamic information migration in DCs: Solution Survey
         draft-gu-opsawg-policies-migration-solution-survey-00

Abstract

   This draft enumerates several kinds of potential solutions that may
   resolve the problem described in I-D.gu-opsawg-policies-migration.
   The goal is to, on one hand, make deeper analysis to this problem
   and, on the other hand, provide informaiton for gap analysis, and
   authors of gap analysis can make research on the potential solutions
   to find out whether there are existing protocols or mechanisms can be
   reused to compose a specific potential solution.  The solutions
   introduced here are just high level thought and, if one solution is
   regarded as a preferred way, we need to analyze and define, if
   needed, detail mechanism and protocols in future.

Internet-Draft  policy and dynamic information migration       July 2011


1.  Introduction

   At the beginning of the draft, we briefly introduce the problem
   stated in I-D.gu-opsawg-policies-migration.  Virtualization is widly
   used in Data Center, and VMs are allowed to do hot, or live,
   migration from one location to another location within or between
   data centers.  VMs migration implies OS/software/memory copy on
   server side and policies, including static policies and dynamic
   information learned by network devices, migration on network side.
   I-D.gu-opsawg-polices-migration and this draft focus on policies
   migration on network side.

   In this draft, we first list some general requirements for solutions.
   Based on the requirements and the essence of this problem, the author
   of this draft envision three potential solutions for policies
   migration.  The author would enphasize that it does not necessarily
   mean that final solution will be one of the potential solutions,
   which are just ways to help people understand the problem.  People
   may find more suitable solution beyond these potential solutions in
   the future and the author would like to work on that.

   In the following sections, detail examples and senarios are given to
   explain why and which polices need to migrate with VM.


2.  Terminologies and concepts

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The document uses terms defined in
   [I-D.gu-opsawg-policies-migration]and
   [I-D.wang-opsawg-policy-migration-gap-analysis].


3.  Potential Solutions Overview

   There are three important components in this problem: VMs, source
   device and destination devices.  The diagram in I-D.gu-opsawg-
   policies-migration can be abstrated as in Fig.1.  COORDINATOR is a
   new entity introduced in this draft.  It's noted as optional because
   it is not always required in all potential solutions introduced in
   this draft.  When VM is running on original location, static policies
   have been configured on source devices and dynamic information has
   been learned by source devices.  When we say POLICIES in the
   following text in this draft, it refers to both static policies and
   dynamic information.  The potential solutions need at least three

   mechnism to achieve policies migraiton:

   o  Migration Notification: The Migration Notification message is a
      trigger to source and destination devices to do policies
      migration.  The migration Notification message could be triggered
      by VM or a centralized manager, which could be network manager or
      a separated function entity who communicates with VM Manager and
      obtain VM's status in migration, call it COORDINATOR.  Anyway, the
      Migration Notification message should be able to do either or both
      of the following actions:

      *  Notify the source devices that a VM is going to emigrate and
         it's good time to move the VM's policies.  The message must
         include a VM ID to uniquely identify the VM, The message may
         also include the ID of destination devices that VM is going to
         move to.  The destination devices ID could be IP Address or
         other identifier that source devices can connect to.

      *  Notify the destination devices that a VM is going to immigrate
         here and it's good time to obtain the VM's policies.  The
         message must include a VM ID to uniquely identify the VM, The
         message may also include the ID of source devices that VM is
         going to move to.  The source devices ID could be IP Address or
         other identifier that source devices can connect to.

   o  Policies Transfering: Policies could be transferred directly
      between network devices, or be transferred through a third party,
      i.e. the COORDINATOR.

   o  Migration Feedback: The Migration Feedback mesage can let VM
      manager or Hypervisor know whether policies are successfully
      migrated.  If it's successfully migrated and enabled on
      destination devices, the VM can be resumed on new location.
      Otherwise, the VM migration must be stopped and VM need to be
      resumed on original location.

              Figure 1: Key componnets in policies migration

   In the following sections, different kind of potential solutions have
   been introduced, together with pros and cons of each solution.
   Finally, the author conclude the solutions and suggest one of the
   potential solutions.  But the author would like to discuss with
   people and would like to explore better solutions beyond what have be
   introduced.


4.  Centralized Solution

   A centralized entity take charge of policies migration between source
   and destination devices.  To describe the centralized solution
   briefly, the centralized entity, or name it Coordinator, communicates
   with VM Manager to get VM's status.  Before VM really migrates, the
   COORDINATOR should have already know the source and destination
   location of this VM.  When COORDINATOR finds a specific VM is
   suspending, it requests for DI from source devices, according to the
   network topology.  Then COORDINATOR sets the policies to
   corresponding destination devices.  COORDINATOR sends feedback to VM
   Manager, and the latter decides whether to resume VM on destination
   server.  Fig. 2 shows the process.

                      Figure 2: Centralized solution

   The advantages of centralized solution are:

   o  Complete knowledge of network topology: The COORDINATOR can learn
      network topology from network manager, or it could be a network
      manager itself.  It's not difficult to include Virtual switch in
      physical server into the network topology, hence the COORDINATOR
      can has a whole topology including both physical and virtual
      devices.  So it's easier for COORDINATOR to learn which source
      adjacent bridge the VM is attaching to, and which are the upper
      layer devices.  Also, the COORDINATOR can learn the destination
      adjacent bridge and destination devices.  Even in asymmetric
      architecture, the COORDINATOR with some intelligence can analyze
      network structure and make decision on which devices are the
      partner.

   o  Easier Feedback: the COORDINATOR can collect policies migration
      results for multiple devices, and, since it knows how many devices
      need to migrate policies, feedback the VM manager with SUCCESS or
      FAIL according to the statistic results of policies migration
      results from all related devices.

   o  Full Control and easier logging: Policies migration is under
      control of COORDINATOR.

Internet-Draft  policy and dynamic information migration       July 2011


   The disadvantages of centralized solution are:

   o  Capacity bottleneck: Usually VM won't migrate frequently, but many
      VMs may migrate at one time.  For example, VMs belonging to the
      same client may migrate from one location to another at one time,
      or VMs at one geographic location may migrate to another
      geographic location at one time for seamless disaster avoidance.
      If lots of VM migration happens at one time, the COORDINATOR could
      be a capacity bottleneck.

   o  Longer service suspending time: Because COORDINATOR has to collect
      policies from source devices and then set them to destination
      devices, it will take longer time to finish policies migration
      process compared with Distributed solutions and Middle solutions.
      But the process could be shorten if upload and download of
      policies are allowed to happen synchronously.

   In order to mitigate the disadvantages of Centralized Solution, an
   idea of Middle solution is explored.


5.  Middle Solution

   A middle solution is neither a fully distributed or fully centralized
   solution.  A COORDINATOR device is placed to ease the migration
   notification and migration feedback process.  But less workload is
   puted on COORDINATOR than Centralized solution which increases
   capacity and extensibility, and few or no updating requirements for
   software updating when devices functions are updated.

   A centralized entity is deployed to assist migration notification and
   asymetric policies migration.  The basic process is: the COORDINATOR
   gets VM's status from VM Manager.  Then the COORDINATOR sends
   migration notification to source devices according to network
   topology.  Source devices upload corresponding DI to COORDINATOR.
   Meanwhile or shortly later, COORDINATOR notifies destination devices
   to download DI.  After all polices are adopted by destination
   devices, COORDINATOR sends feedback to VM Manager.

       ----------                ----------

                         Figure 3: Middle Solution

   The difference between Middle solution and Centralized solution is
   that policies in Middle solution are transparent to COORDINATOR, i.e.
   COORDINATOR can act as a DI transfer database without knowleadge of
   the content of DI.  The software on COORDINATOR does not have to be
   updated every time a new element function is defined that creates or
   uses new DI.  So the coordination functions provided by the
   COORDINATOR is as simple and general as possible.

   The advantages of middle solution are:

      Controllable: The COORDINATOR can be intelligent to assist
      Administrators to trace and control policies migration.

      Easier logging.

      General solution: The COORDINATOR needn't be aware of the content
      of DI, so that the COORDINATOR needn't be updated even new DI is
      supported.

Internet-Draft  policy and dynamic information migration       July 2011


      Easier feedback: COORDINATOR can be aware whether all policies
      migration have completed.  Then the COORDINATOR can feedback to VM
      Manager with SUCCESS or FAIL, and the latter will make decision on
      where to resume the VM.

      Good extensibility: Since COORDINATOR is only a coordinator to
      indicate migration notification and partnership, there won't be
      huge workload on it even when many VMs migrated at one time.  The
      COORDINATOR in this case can support much larger scale of VM
      migration then centralized solution and middle solution with
      distributed migration notification.

      Quick policies migration: COORDINATOR is a DI transfer database,
      and it needn't GET and SET policies by itself.  So the workload on
      COORDINATOR is much less than Centralized solution.

   The disadvantages of middle solution are:

      New mechanism is needed to support DI migration asymmetric
      structure.


6.  Distributed Solutions

6.1.  D-PUSH Solution

   A fully distributed solution doesn't need a COORDINATOR.  To describe
   the Distributed solution briefly, the source Hypervisor, who knows
   about the VM's Status send VDP(VSI Discovery and Configuration
   Protocol, defined in IEEE802.1 Qbg) Associate message, with S-Bit
   set, to adjacent bridge.  VM's ID is carried in VDP Associate
   mesasge, and S-Bit =1 means the specific VM is suspending now.  The
   adjacent bridge distributes the notification to upper layer devices,
   including bridges and middleboxes.  Then all related devices
   transfered the policies, that is relevant to the specific VM, to
   corresponding destination devices.  When all policies have been
   migrated, successfully or failed, the source devices send feedback
   message to original Hypervisor.  Let's call this process as D-PUSH,
   i.e. distributed solution with source devices push policies to
   destination devices.  Fig. 4 shows the process.

6.2.  D-PULL Solution

   An alternative distributed solution is D-PULL solution.  The
   destination Hypervisor sends a VDP Associate message with M-Bit set,
   which means the specific VM, identified by the VMID in VDP message,
   is migrating.  Upon receving the VDP Associate with M-Bit =1, the
   adjacent bridge distribute the VM's status to upper layer devices,
   including bridges and middleboxes.  Then the destination devices will
   PULL the policies from corresponding devices.  Fig. 5 shows the
   process.

6.3.  Pros and Cons of Distributed solutions

   D-PUSH and D-PULL solution have common pros and cons.

   Common advantages of D-PUSH and D-PULL solutions:

   o  Good extensibility: Since the whole process are executed by
      network devices, without any centralized entity involving, there
      is no capacity bottleneck, which usually happens at centralized
      entity.

   Common disadvantages of D-PUSH and D-PULL solutions:

   o  Out of control: Policies are migrated totally by network devices,
      administrator can not control them.  Administrator may lose the
      trace of the policies, especially when network administrators have
      no idea of where the VM has gone.  There might be security risk,
      e.g. policies conflict with existing policies on destination
      devices, or new policies can not be supported by destination
      devices.  Additional solutions need to be defined to resolve these
      problems.

   o  Lack of information: Currently, VDP doesn't carry destination or
      source devices addresses.  That means, when source or destination

      adjacent bridges receives the VDP messages, they only know about
      the VM ID and VM status, and have no idea of the IP addresses of
      destination or source devices.  Without the information of source
      or destination devices, it's not feasible to transfer policies
      directly between source and destination devices.  Either extend
      VDP or take advantage of a centralized entity to notify IP
      addresses of source or destination devices.

   o  Hard to resolve asymmetric architecture: if the source and
      destination network structures are asymmetric, it's hard for
      network devices to decide where to PUSH or PULL the policies.  In
      fact, it's because network devices have limited knowledge of
      network topology.

   o  Hard to feedback: there might be more than one device that possess
      policies related to the specific VM.  However the Hypervisor has
      no idea of how many devices have and need to migrate VM-related
      policies.  Assuming each device feedback its policies migration
      results to Hypervisor, how could Hypervisor knows whether the
      received results are all the results it needs?


7.  Conclusion

   This draft has introduces several kinds of potential solutions for
   problem stated in I-D.gu-opsawg-policies-migration.  Pros and cons
   are listed for each solution.  And according to the pros and cons
   analysis, the author feels that Middle solution with centralized
   migration notification is better.  However all these solutions are
   just high level thought.  The author welcome people who are
   interested in resolving this problem to work together to define a
   good solution for the problem.


8.  Security Considerations

   Security mechanism should be considered and resolved no matter which
   solution is finally choosed.
