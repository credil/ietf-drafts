              Reconfigure Triggered by DHCPv6 Relay Agents
                draft-ietf-dhc-triggered-reconfigure-04

Abstract

   This document defines new DHCPv6 messages: Reconfigure-Request and
   Reconfigure-Reply.  Reconfigure-Request message is sent by a DHCPv6
   relay agent to notify a DHCPv6 server about a configuration
   information change, so that the DHCPv6 server can send a Reconfigure
   message accordingly.  Reconfigure-Reply message is used by the server
   to acknowledge the receipt of Reconfigure-Request.

   This document updates RFC 3315 and RFC 6422.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Problem

   [RFC6422] updates the DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315] with a new
   feature to let a DHCPv6 relay agent communicate information towards a
   DHCPv6 client, and which is not available at the DHCPv6 server.  This
   is achieved owing to the use of RSOO (Relay-Supplied Options option)
   which carries configuration data to the DHCPv6 server.  The data
   conveyed in an RSOO is then sent back by the DHCPv6 server to the
   requesting DHCPv6 client.

   An example of a RSOO context is shown in Figure 1; only a subset of
   exchanged DHCPv6 and RADIUS messages is represented.  Figure 1 shows
   a broadband network scenario in which the Network Access Server (NAS)
   embeds a DHCPv6 relay agent.

                     Figure 2: Change of configuration

   Whenever the configuration information sent by the DHCPv6 relay agent
   to the DHCPv6 server change, the DHCPv6 server has no means to detect
   it so that it can send a Reconfigure message with the updated
   configuration data accordingly.  A solution is sketched in Section 2.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Proposed Solution

   To solve the problem described in Section 1.1, this document proposes
   a new DHCP message called Reconfigure-Request.  In the example
   depicted in Figure 3, a Reconfigure-Request message is sent by the
   DHCPv6 relay agent to a DHCPv6 server as soon as the configuration
   data conveyed in an RSOO option have changed.  Upon receipt of this
   message, and if it is configured to support such mode, the DHCPv6
   server must build Reconfigure-Reply and Reconfigure messages.
   Reconfigure-Reply is used to acknowledge the receipt of Reconfigure-
   Request.  Reconfigure message encapsulated in Relay-Reply is sent to
   the DHCPv6 relay, which in turn will forward the message to the
   appropriate DHCPv6 client.

   This setup assumes the relay has a record of the client, so that it
   has enough information to send the Reconfigure-Request message to the
   server.  How the state is recorded in the relay is out of scope.

   Furthermore, means to recover state in failure events must be
   supported, but are not discussed in this document.

              Figure 3: Flow Example with Reconfigure-Request

   The support of Reconfigure-Reply simplifies the retransmission
   procedure of the relay as it provides an explicit indication from the
   server (see Section 4.3 for more details).  An alternative approach
   is the relay monitors Reconfigure messages received from the server
   to conclude whether Reconfigure-Request was successfully handled or
   not.  Nevertheless, this implicit approach may fail to achieve its
   goals in some cases: e.g., the server accepts the request but it
   delays to generate the corresponding Reconfigure messages due to its
   rate-limiting policies, the request was partially failed for some
   clients, etc.  To avoid useless reconfigure cycles (e.g., due to the
   loss of Reconfigure-Reply), the approach adopted in this document
   allows the relay to correct the content of a re-transmitted
   Reconfigure-Request based on some observed events (e.g., the client
   has retrieved the updated configuration).  If the relay has no client
   to reconfigured, it stops sending Reconfigure-Request messages.

   The Reconfigure-Request message can also be used in other scenarios
   than those that assume the use of RSOO.  It is out of scope of this

   The description of the fields are as follows:

      option-code: OPTION_LINK_ADDRESS (To be assigned by IANA, see
      Section 6).

      option-len: 16 (octets).

      link-address: An IPv6 address used by the server to identify the
      link on which the client is located.

   The Link Address Option is used by the relay agent to indicate to the
   server the link on which the client is located.  The relay agent MUST
   use a link-address value that is equivalent to the value used when
   relaying messages from the client to the server.  Two link-address
   values are said to be equivalent if both values are IPv6 addresses
   that are on-link for the network link to which the client is
   connected.  The relay agent SHOULD use the same value that was sent
   to the DHCPv6 server when relaying messages from the client to the
   server, as in Section 20.1.1 of [RFC3315].

4.1.  Messages Format

   Two new message type codes are defined:

Internet-Draft         Relay Triggered Reconfigure            March 2013


   o  RECONFIGURE-REQUEST (To be assigned by IANA, see Section 6).

   o  RECONFIGURE-REPLY (To be assigned by IANA, see Section 6).

   RECONFIGURE-REQUEST and RECONFIGURE-REPLY use the same format as
   defined in Section 6 of [RFC3315].

4.2.  Messages Validation

4.2.1.  RECONFIGURE-REQUEST

   Clients MUST silently discard any received RECONFIGURE-REQUEST
   messages.

   Servers MUST silently discard any received RECONFIGURE-REQUEST
   messages that meet any of the following conditions:

   o  the message does not include a Client Identifier Option [RFC3315].

   o  the message does not include a Link Address Option (Section 3).

   o  the message includes a Server Identifier Option [RFC3315] but the
      contents of the Server Identifier Option does not match the
      server's identifier.

4.2.2.  RECONFIGURE-REPLY

   Clients and Servers MUST silently discard any received RECONFIGURE-
   REPLY messages.

   The relay MUST silently discard any received RECONFIGURE-REPLY
   messages that meet any of the following conditions:

   o  the "transaction-id" field in the message does not match the value
      used in the original message.

   o  the message does not include a Server Identifier Option.

   o  the message does not include a Status Code Option [RFC3315].

4.3.  Creation and Transmission of RECONFIGURE-REQUEST

   For any event (e.g., modification of the configuration information)
   that requires the server to issue a Reconfigure message, the relay
   agent determines the client(s) affected by the change and then builds
   a Reconfigure-Request message: the relay agent sets the "msg-type"
   field to RECONFIGURE-REQUEST, generates a transaction ID and inserts
   it in the "transaction-id" field.

Internet-Draft         Relay Triggered Reconfigure            March 2013


   The relay agent MUST include one or more Client Identifier Options
   [RFC3315] and a Link Address Option (Section 3) so that the DHCPv6
   server can identify the corresponding client and the link on which
   the client is located.

   The relay agent MAY supply the updated configuration in the RSOO
   [RFC6422].  The relay agent MAY supply a Reconfigure Message Option
   to indicate which form of Reconfigure to use.  The relay agent MAY
   include any option (e.g., Interface Identifier [RFC3315]) which it
   might insert when relaying a message received from a client.

   When several clients on the same link are affected by a configuration
   change, the relay MUST include several Client Identifier Options,
   each of them identifies a specific client.  If including Client
   Identifier Options of all impacted clients exceeds the maximum
   message size (see Section 5), the relay MUST generate several
   RECONFIGURE-REQUEST messages required to carry all Client Identifier
   Options.  Rate-limit considerations are discussed in Section 5.

   The relay transmits RECONFIGURE-REQUEST messages according to Section
   14 of [RFC3315], using the following parameters:

     IRT    1 sec
     MRT    10 secs
     MRC    5
     MRD    0

   When retransmission is required, the relay may decide to correct the
   content of RECONFIGURE-REQUEST message it issues (e.g., update the
   Client Identifier list).  This decision is local to the relay (e.g.,
   it may be based on observed events such as one or more clients were
   reconfigured on their own).

   The relay may receive Reconfigure encapsulated in Relay-Reply before
   Reconfigure-Reply.  The relay SHOULD NOT interpret it as if the
   Reconfigure-Request was successfully handled by the Server.  The
   relay SHOULD use Reconfigure-Reply, not the Reconfigure message, to
   determine if the request was successful.

4.4.  Intermediate Relay Agents Behaviour

   The relay agent MUST be configurable to accept or reject RECONFIGURE-
   REQUEST messages received from other relay agents.  If no indication
   is explicitly configured to the relay, the default behavior is to
   accept RECONFIGURE-REQUEST messages.

   If the relay is configured to reject RECONFIGURE-REQUEST, the relay
   MUST silently discard any RECONFIGURE-REQUEST it receives.  If the

Internet-Draft         Relay Triggered Reconfigure            March 2013


   relay is configured to accept RECONFIGURE-REQUEST messages, these
   messages are relayed as specified in Section 20.1.1 of [RFC3315].

4.5.  Server Behaviour

   The server MUST be configurable to accept or reject RECONFIGURE-
   REQUEST messages.  If no indication is explicitly configured to the
   server, the default behavior is to reject RECONFIGURE-REQUEST
   messages.

   If the server is configured to reject RECONFIGURE-REQUEST, the server
   MUST silently discard any RECONFIGURE-REQUEST it receives.

   Upon receipt of a valid Reconfigure-Request message from a DHCPv6
   relay agent (see Section 4.2), the server determines the client(s)
   for which a Reconfigure message is to be sent.

   The server constructs a Reconfigure-Reply message by setting the
   "msg-type" field to RECONFIGURE-REPLY, and copying the transaction ID
   from the RECONFIGURE-REQUEST message into the "transaction-id" field.
   The server MUST include a Status Code Option [RFC3315] indicating
   whether the request is successfully processed, failed or partially
   failed.

   o  If the server fails to validate the request, the server MUST set
      the Status Code Option to the appropriate status code (e.g.,
      UnspecFail, NotAllowed, etc.).  In particular,

      *  UnspecFail MUST be returned if Reconfigure-Request message is
         malformed.

      *  NotAllowed MUST be returned if the server is not configured to
         allow Reconfigure-Request.

      *  NotConfigured MUST be returned if the server has no record of
         the link.

   o  If the Reconfigure-Request is successfully validated, the server
      MUST return a Status Code Option indicating "Success".  In
      addition, the server MUST include a list of all the Client
      Identifier Options of the clients to which Reconfigure messages
      will not be sent (e.g., the server has no record of the client or
      the client did not negotiate for Reconfigure support).  Note that
      this means that "Success" will be returned even if Reconfigure
      messages will not be sent to any of the clients.

   If RSOO is supplied, the server MAY use its content to double check
   whether a Reconfigure is required to be sent to the client.  This

   assumes the server store the content of RSOO it used to generate
   configuration data sent to requesting clients.

   The server MAY use the content of the Reconfigure Message Option
   supplied by the relay agent to determine which form of Reconfigure to
   use.

   Then, the server MUST follow the procedure defined in Section 19.1 of
   [RFC3315] to construct a Reconfigure message.

   Rate-limit considerations are discussed in Section 5.

4.6.  Receipt of RECONFIGURE-REPLY

   Depending on the status code enclosed in a received RECONFIGURE-REPLY
   message, the relay may decide to terminate the request or try a
   different corrected Reconfigure-Request.


5.  Rate Limiting Considerations

   The relay MUST rate-limit Reconfigure-Request messages to be sent to
   the server.  The relay MUST be configured with required rate-limit
   parameters (i.e., the rate of Reconfigure messages).  The maximum
   Reconfigure-Request packet size SHOULD be configurable and the
   default value MUST be 1280 octets.

   The server MUST rate-limit Reconfigure messages triggered by
   Reconfigure-Request messages.  The server MUST be configured with
   required rate-limit parameters (i.e., the rate of Reconfigure
   messages).


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the following new DHCPv6 Message type in
   the registry maintained in
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters:

      RECONFIGURE-REQUEST

7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations elaborated in [RFC3315] (in particular
   Section 21.1) and [RFC6422] must be taken into account.  In addition,
   DHCPv6 servers MAY be configured to discard relayed Reconfigure-
   Request messages or restrict relay chaining (see [RFC5007] for more
   discussion about the rationale of this recommended behavior).

   Relay agents SHOULD implement appropriate means to prevent using
   Reconfigure-Request messages as a denial-of-service attack on the
   DHCPv6 servers.

   Because Reconfigure-Request message provides a mechanism for
   triggering the DHCP Reconfigure message, and the DHCP Reconfigure
   message can raise security threats (e.g., to control the timing of a
   DHCP renewal), the DHCP server MUST have some mechanism for
   determining that the relay agent is a trusted entity.  Reconfigure-
   Request messages originating from unknown relay agents MUST be
   silently dropped.
