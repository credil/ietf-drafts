   multiple CDNs requires to match against a set functional requirements
   but also operational requirements.  This memo discusses a few
   operational requirements and the impact to the current request
   routing proposals.

1.  Introduction

   Request routing in CDNs and also in the case of interconnecting
   multiple CDNs requires to match against a set functional requirements
   (see [I-D.lefaucheur-cdni-requirements]) but also operational
   requirements.  This memo discusses a few operational requirements and
   the impact to the current request routing proposals
   [I-D.peterson-cdni-strawman] and [I-D.xiaoyan-cdni-requestrouting].
   This draft presents some initial considerations about request routing
   in CDN interconnect scenarios.

   Comments and discussions about this memo should be directed to the
   CDNI WG: cdni@ietf.org.

2.  Speed Matters

   The speed of content delivery matters a lot in CDNs for the actual
   content consumer, but also for the content provider.  The content
   consumer does not like to wait for too long until the content is
   being displayed on its device.  The content provider wants to achieve
   a fast and reliable content delivery.  However, the current request
   routing proposals suggest that the time from the first content
   request to the actual start of delivery does not matter much.

   For instance, method 1 of [I-D.peterson-cdni-strawman], shown in
   Figure 1, requires 4 "transactions", as seen from the End-User to
   start the delivery of content.  The total time from the first request
   to the actual data delivery is: t_start = t_I + t_II + t_III + t_IV.

               Figure 1: Method 1 of CDNI Strawman proposal

   To give an impression about the times to expect for t_total here are
   some values for a DNS resolution process and also round trip times
   (RTT).  NB: These numbers are measured from Germany via an ADSL
   access, German research network (DFN) access, and via a 3G network
   operator in Germany (Eplus).  NB: Those numbers are not
   representative as they are out of single runs and not multiple runs
   spread over a larger time windows.  They are rather given to
   illustrate the challenge.

   +------------------+--------------------------------+---------------+
   | Access-Type      | DNS resolution (gmx.de,cached) | RTT (Germany) |
   +------------------+--------------------------------+---------------+
   | ADSL (11 MBit/s) |              26 ms             |     30 ms     |
   |                  |                                |               |
   | DFN (32 MBit/s)  |              12 ms             |  10 to 20 ms  |
   |                  |                                |               |
   | 3G (EPlus)       |          200 to 300 ms         | 200 to 300 ms |
   +------------------+--------------------------------+---------------+

                      Table 1: Some time measurements

   As compared to a popular video site (e.g., youtube.com) where the
   video is delivered after roughly 2 seconds (19 ms to resolve FQDN of
   cache in charge, 2 ms for TCP 3-way handshake, and yet 2 seconds
   until the content is actually requested).  This has been test from
   the DFN network connection.  The 2 seconds time seem to come from the
   usage of the Flash player, as the network connection is up,running,
   and already being used for yet another request to the cache.

   Here are the times, assuming that steps I, II, and III are consuming
   the RTT, but neglect the processing times:

   o  ADSL: t_total = 3*30ms + t_IV = 90ms + t_IV

   o  DFN: t_total = 3*20ms + t_IV = 60ms + t_IV

   o  3G: t_total = 3*300ms + t_IV = 900ms + t_IV

   The numbers for step I to III may look reasonable low (except for the
   3G case), but t_IV isn't know yet, leaving still potential to prolong
   the long process anyhow.

3.  Failure Detection and Recovery

   It is hard to foresee from the current request routing specifications
   how a failure in the downstream CDN is detected by the upstream CDN
   and such a failure case can be corrected.

5.  Conclusion

   This draft lists some operational challenges for the request routing
   for the interconnection of CDNs and is more than incomplete.  The
   current proposals ( [I-D.peterson-cdni-strawman] and
   [I-D.xiaoyan-cdni-requestrouting]) for request routing seem not to
   consider the overall time from the first service request to the start
   of the content delivery.
