Internet-Draft          CoAP Via Option Extension          December 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document adds a new option to the Constrained Application
   Protocol : Via. The via option is used to indicate the proxies
   between the coap client and the coap server.

1.1.  Motivation

   A proxy is a CoAP endpoint that can be tasked by CoAP clients to
   perform requests on their behalf.  Proxy is helpful to reduce
   response time, network bandwidth consumption and energy consumption.

   There may be zero or more proxies between two endpoints, when an
   endpoint receives a coap message, it needs to know the proxies which
   have forwarded this message.  So this document is intended to define
   a new option which can be used to track the message and avoid forward
   loops.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terms Proxy, Coap Client and Coap Server as specified in the
   terminology section of [I-D.ietf-core-coap].

2.  Option Definition

       +--------+---+---+---+---+------+--------+--------+--------+
       |   No   | C | U | N | R | Name |Format  | Length | Default|
       +--------+---+---+---+---+------+--------+--------+--------+
       |  TBD   |   |   |   | X |  via | string | 1-255  | (none) |
       +--------+---+---+---+---+------+--------+--------+--------+

   The Via option is "elective" and "safe" . when a proxy doesn't
   recognise this option, it can ignore this option.

   The value of this option is a string which MUST be globally unique,
   e.g., IP address, domain name or any other identifiers of the proxy
   endpoint.

   The via option can occur more than once.

   When a proxy endpoint receives a coap message with via options, the
   proxy MUST first check the via options value, if the via option
   configured in the proxy endpoint is equal to one of the via options
   in the coap message, there occurs a forward loop , the proxy MUST
   drop this coap message.

   When a proxy endpoint forwards a coap message, it can add a new via
   option into the message at the end of the existing via options.

   The via option can be used in the request message and/or the response
   messages.  It is recommended that the proxy can be configured to add
   this option into request and/or response message.

3.  Example

   In the example below, there are two proxies between client and
   server: proxy1 and proxy2 ,the via option are configured with value
   "proxy1@test.com" and "proxy2@test.com".


         Client              Proxy1              Proxy2         Server

         | no via  option    |                   |                   |

         |                   |via:proxy1@test.com|                   |
         |                   +------------------>|                   |
         |                   |  REQUEST(2)       |                   |
         |                   |                   |via:proxy1@test.com|
         |                   |                   |via:proxy2@test.com|

         |                   |                   |   no via option   |
         |                   |                   |<------------------+
         |                   |                   |     RESPONSE(4)   |
         |                   |via:proxy2@test.com|                   |

         |                   |      RESPONSE(5)  |                   |
         |via:proxy2@test.com|                   |                   |
         |via:proxy1@test.com|                   |                   |
         |<------------------+                   |                   |

   (1)Client sends a request message with no via option;

   (2)Proxy1 adds a via option into the request message, the option
   value is "proxy1@test.com";

   (3)Proxy2 adds a via option into the request message following
   proxy1, the value is "proxy2@test.com",then the request message has
   two via options.

   (4)Server responses this request with no via option;

   (5)Proxy2 adds a via option into the response message, the option
   value is "proxy2@test.com";

   (6)Proxy1 add a via option into the response message following

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add the following option number entries:

           +--------+----------+------------ +
           | Number | Name     | Reference   |
           +--------+----------+-------------+
           |  TBD   | Via      | RFCXXXX     |
           +--------+--------- +-------------+

5.  Security Considerations

   However, once there were too many proxies between client and server,
   and all the proxies are enabled to add this via option, so that it
   will make the length of the message so long , and correspondingly
   increase energy consumption or network consumption.
