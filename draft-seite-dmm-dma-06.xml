       Most existing IP mobility solutions are derived from Mobile IP principles where a given mobility anchor 
	   maintains Mobile Nodes (MNs) binding up-to-date. Data traffic is then encapsulated between the mobility anchor and the MN or its Access Router. 
	   These approaches are usually implemented on a centralised architectures where both MN context and traffic encapsulation need to be processed at a central network entity, i.e. the mobility anchor.  
		However, one of the trend in mobile network evolution is to "flatten" mobility architecture by confining mobility support in the access network, e.g. at the access routers level, keeping the rest of the network unaware of the mobility events and their support.
		This document discusses the deployment of a Proxy Mobile IP approach in such a flat architecture.
		The solution allows to dynamically distribute mobility functions among access routers for an optimal routing management. 
		The goal is also to dynamically adapt the mobility support of the MN’s needs by applying traffic redirection only to MNs’ flows	when an IP handover occurs.

   <section title="Introduction">
    
    <t>
    	Most existing IP mobility solutions are derived from Mobile IP <xref target="RFC3775"/> principles where a given mobility agent (e.g. the Home Agent (HA) in Mobile IP or the Local Mobility Agent (LMA) in Proxy Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC5213"/>) maintains Mobile Nodes (MNs) bindings. Data traffic is then encapsulated between the MN or its Access Router (e.g. the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) in PMIPv6) and its mobility agent. In other words, these approaches rely on a centralised architecture where both MN mobility context and traffic encapsulation features need to be maintained at a central network entity, the mobility agent. Such centralised approach provides the ability to route MN traffic whatever its localisation is, as well as to support handovers when it moves from access router to access router; however, when millions of MNs are communicating in a given cellular network, such a centralised network entity may cause bottlenecks and single point of failure issues, which requires costly network dimensioning and engineering to be fixed. In addition, tunnelling encapsulations impact the global network efficiency since they require the maintenance of MN's specific contexts in each tunnel end nodes and they incur delays in packet processing and transport functions. Besides, centralized mobility management might not take into account current network evolution where the trend is to cache and distribute content (e.g. CDN architecture) closer to the end-user. As a consequence, alternative mobility approaches are currently being discussed and a potential solution is the distribution of mobility anchors, as stated by requirement "REQ1" in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements"/>.	 
	</t>
	
	<t>
		Moreover, it is well established that a huge amount of mobile communications are set up while the MN remains attached to the same access router. For example, the user is being communicating at home, in his office, at a café, etc. and the mobility support is thus not required. Applying the aforementioned centralised principles leads then to maintain user’s mobility contexts, whereas the MN remains motionless. So, to avoid such a waste of ressources, mobility management should come into play only when the mobile node changes the point of attachment (i.e. performs a handover) and when it needs the conservation of the current IP address. Actually, this is the requirement "REQ2" from <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements"/>.		
	</t>
	<t>
	   The DMM working group has been chartered to address above issues by exploring the distribution of mobility management functions and, for the sake of pragmatism, it has been agreed to firstly focus on existing  mobility protocols. The goal of this document is to address this concern and, thus, has no other ambition than to discuss the use of legacy IP mobility protocols in distributed anchoring architecture. Besides, it must be noted this document aims only to meet basic <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements"/> requirements, namely:

	<section anchor="sec.dmm.fdls" title="Fundamentals">
	<t>
	As stated in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements"/>, mobility anchoring may be distributed to multiple locations in the access network. For example, mobility anchoring (MA) function could be co-located with the access router (AR) as shown on <xref target="fig.dmm.basics"/>. This architecture allows the traffic to be anchored closer to the  mobile node and, for example, to provide optimal mobility support to distributed content (e.g. CDN based delivery architecture).

	<t>
	Mobility management may be partially distributed, i.e. only the data plane is distributed, or fully distributed, i.e. both the data plane and control plane are distributed <xref target="I-D.yokota-dmm-scenario"/>. If conceptual differences exist, these two approaches share common fundamentals and it is possible to describe the generic behavior of a DMM deployment. Note that the following focuses only on the two first requirements of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements"/> (i.e. distribution of mobile anchoring and dynamic mobility management)
	</t>
	<t>
       	In a standard IPv6 network without specific mobility support, any host is able to set up communications flows using a global IPv6 address acquired with the support of its current access router <xref target="RFC4862"/>. When the host moves from this access router to a new one, its ongoing IP sessions cannot be maintained without leveraging on IP mobility mechanisms. However, once attached to the new access router, the host can again acquire a routable global IPv6 address to be used for any new communication flow it sets up. Hence, a flow based mobility support may be restricted to provide traffic indirection to host’s flows that are already ongoing	during host’s handovers between access routers. Any new flow being set up uses the new host’s global address acquired on the new link available after the handover.
	  </t>
	  <t>
		When a multiple-interface host moves between access routers of different access technologies, such a simple approach can also be applied, considering that each network interface provides dynamically global IPv6 addresses acquired on current access routers. 
	  </t>
	  <t> 
		Hence, any given IP flow can be considered as implicitly anchored on the current MN’s access router when being set up. Meaning that, if the MN moves across more than one access router and initiates IP communications while being attached to different access routers, the MN might be served simultaneously by more than one mobility anchor. While the MN is attached to its initial access router, the IP flow is delivered as for any standard IPv6 node.  The anchoring function at the access router is thus needed only to manage traffic indirection if the MN moves to a new access router and for subsequent movements while the IP flow remains active), maintaining the flow communication until it ends up.  
      </t>
      <t>
		Any flow’s incoming packet toward the MN is routed in a standard way to the access router anchoring the flow as the packet contains the destination IP address issued from router prefix. 
		Then, if the MN is currently attached to the initial anchor access router, the incoming packet is directly delivered over the access link. Otherwise, the anchoring access router needs to redirect the packet to the current (or one of the currents) MN’s access router(s). 
      </t>
      <t>
		Any flow’s outgoing packet from the MN is sent over either the initial anchor access router link or another access router link it is currently using. In the first case, the packet can be routed in a standard way, i.e., without requiring networks mobility support functions. In the second case, we consider its redirection to the initial flows’ anchor router, but it may be noticed that direct routing by the current access router may be also allowed (yet this may lead to more stringent security and policy considerations). 
      </t>
	  </section>
	  <section title="Considerations on Client based mobility management">
      <t>
		  Actually, there is no issue to implement a basic DMM (as described in previous section) with vanilla Mobile IP protocol, e.g. <xref target="RFC3775"/>, as long as the MN can manage simultaneously different bindings to different Home Agents (HA), i.e. manage simultaneously more than one tunnel to the mobile anchors.  Basically, nothing prevent to implement the HA functionalities in the access routers, so that any given IP flow can be considered as implicitly anchored on the current host's access router when set up.  The anchoring function at the access router is acting only to manage traffic indirection while the host moves to a new access router. When the MN moves to a new access router, the MN implicitly considers the previous access router as the HA for IP addresses allocated by this access router. Then, the MN can perform the binding update to the previous access router for IP session initiated on it. So, MN's current traffic remains attached to the previous access router which is responsible for forwarding the IP flows to the MN.  
   </t>
   <t>
   <xref target="fig.dmm.mip"/> illustrates the use of Mobile IP in a distributed architecture. For example, let's consider an IP flow, flow#1, initiated by the mobile node, MN, when attached to AR1.
   Flow#1 is routed in a standard way as long as the MN remains attached to AR1. If the MN moves to AR2, the MN proceeds to the binding update to AR1, which plays the role of HA, so that flow#1 remains anchored to AR1. The home address is the IP address obtained from AR1 and the Care-of-Address is the IP address obtained from AR2. If MN starts a new IP communication, flow#2, while attached to AR2; flow#2 is routed in a standard way as long as the MN remains attached to AR2.  In this situation, applications can use either the Home Address or the Care-of-Address and the IP stack is supposed to make the source address selection depending on the need for mobility support; in the example of <xref target="fig.dmm.mip"/>, the Home Address shall be used as the source address for flow#1 and the Care-of-Addresses for flow#2. Then, if the MN moves to another access router, flow#1 and flow#2 will be respectively anchored to AR1/HA and AR2/HA. Mobile IP resources (mobility context and tunneling in both ARx/HA and MN) are released after IP communcation stopped.

	  <section title="Considerations on Network based mobility management">
      <t>
		 It is also possible to go for DMM with Proxy Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC5213"/>. For example, mobility functions, i.e. MAG and LMA, can be co-located with the access routers. The anchoring behavior might be similar to the client based solution; however there is an issue with the binding update management. In a network based solution, the MN is not supposed to participate to mobility signaling and the MAG is expected to know the mobility anchor serving the MN. This problem can be tricky in distributed mobility architecture because 1) the MN can be served by more than one LMA (see fundamentals in <xref target="sec.dmm.fdls"/>) and 2) the mobility anchor depends on point of attachment when the IP communication has been initiated. There are basically two ways to address the issue without modifying proxy mobile IP:
		 
		 <vspace blankLines="1" />

        <list style="numbers">
        <t>
		Involve the MN in the mobility management process: during the attachment process to a new access router, the MN could communicate its ongoing mobility sessions (i.e. list of current HNP with associated mobility anchors) to the MAG. For example, this information could be provided in a dedicated router solicitation option.	
		</t>
		<t>
		Rely on centralized part of the control plane: when the MN attaches to a new access router, the MAG function retrieves the mobility sessions, for that MN, from a centralized database. This database is expected to be updated each time a new prefix is allocated to the MN, and also when the prefix is released.
		</t>
		</list>
		<vspace blankLines="1" />
		Even if the first option does not introduce a new piece of protocol, it can be seen as a violation of the basic of the network based mobility approach where the MN must remain agnostic of the mobility support. So, in the following, we will go for the second option.
	  </t>

    <section title="Solution Overview for network based DMM">
     <section anchor="sct.dma" title="Distributed and Dynamic Mobility Anchoring">
      <t>
        The basic idea is to distribute mobility traffic management with dynamic user's traffic anchoring in access network nodes. The solution relies on a very simple flat architecture outlined in <xref target="fig.dma.archi"/> where the  Mobility capable Access Router (MAR) supports both traffic anchoring and MN's location management functionalities. The architecture relies on a centralized database storing ongoing mobility sessions for the MNs (see <xref target="sect.call.flow"/> for details). This database stores the HNPs currently allocated to the MN and their respective anchoring point. This database could be an extension to the policy store used in <xref target="RFC5213"/>; however, the detailed specification of the interaction between MAGs and this database is currenly out of the scope of this document.

       Regular IPv6 routing applies when an IP communication is initiated. For instance, if the mobile node (e.g. MN1), being attached to MAR1, initiates a communication: flow#1; the traffic will be routed through MAR1 without requiring any specific mobility operation. 
	   When MN1 moves away from MAR1 and attaches to MAR2, the traffic remains anchored to MAR1 and is tunneled between MAR1 and MAR2. MAR1 becomes the mobility anchor, for IP sessions initiated by MN1 when it was attached to MAR1, and MAR2 plays the role of MAG for these sessions.  
       </t> 
      <t>
        Communications newly initiated, e.g. flow#2, while the mobile node is attached to MAR2 will be routed in a standard way via MAR2. But, if the mobile node moves away from MAR2 (e.g. attaches to MAR3), while maintaining both flow#1 and flow#2, two mobility anchors come into play: flow#1 and flow#2 will be respectively anchored in MAR1 and MAR2. 
		</t>
		<t>
		Summarizing , it is proposed to dynamically locate mobility anchoring depending on where the flow is initially created. Accordingly, communications are expected to be initiated without requiring mobility anchoring and tunneling. Note that, even if a mobile node is moving across several MARs, the tunnel endpoints are always on the initial H-MAR and on the current V-MAR. In the case the mobile node moves from MAR1 to MAR2 then to MAR3, a tunnel will be firstly established between MAR1 and MAR2; then the tunnel will be moved between MAR1 and MAR3.
      </t>
	  <t>
		However such architecture leads to new requirement on the HNP prefix model. Actually, because the HNP is anchored to its mobility anchor (i.e. H-MAR), a dynamic mobility anchoring requires that each MAR must advertise different per-MN prefixes set.

		Following are the  main steps of the handover management process:        
         <vspace blankLines="1" />

        <list style="numbers">
        <t>
         The mobile node, MN1, attaches to MAR1 which is responsible for allocating the MN-HNP, e.g. HNP1 for MN1.
        </t>
		<t>
         Hence, the mobile node can initiate and maintain data transport sessions (with CN1 in the picture), using IP addresses derived from HNP1, in a standard way while it remains attached to MAR1, i.e. mobility functions do not come into play.
        </t>
        <t>
        The MN attaches to MAR2 which will thus acts as V-MAR for HNP1. Fistly, MAR2 retrieves the ongoing MN's mobility sessions from the centralized sessions database; here only one mobility session is ongoing: (MN::HNP1,MAR1). Then MAR2 proceeds to location update for HNP1 with MAR1, which plays the LMA role, i.e., PBU/PBA exchange between MAR2 and MAR1. MAR2 also allocates new prefix (HNP2) for MN1; this prefix is meant to be used by application flows initiated after the handover.        
        </t>
		<t>
		In response to MN's router solicitation, MAR2 is expected to advertise both HNP1 and HNP2 to the MN, for respectively, the IP communications initiated when the MN was attached to MAR1 and the IP communications which will be initiated while attached to MAR2. An IP address derived from HNP1 must not be used for new IP communications; so, prefix HNP1 is announced as deprecated. The MN could also make the prefix selection relying on prefix properties <xref target="I-D.korhonen-dmm-prefix-properties"/> if supported.
		</t>
        <t>
        MAR1, playing the LMA role for HNP1, encapsulates MN1's traffic and tunnels it to the V-MAR, i.e. MAR2, where packets are decapsulated and delivered to the MN. 
        </t>
        <t>
        The mobile node initiates and maintains new data transport sessions, e.g. with CN2, using IP addresses derived from HNP2. This traffic is routed in a standard way while the mobile node remains attached to MAR2.
        </t>
      </list>
     </t>

    <section title="Multiple Interfaces support">
    <t>
		The distribution of mobility functions can also apply in the context of multiple-interfaces terminals.  
		In such a case, any given IP flow can be considered as implicitly anchored on the current host’s access router when set up. 
		Until the host does not move from the initial access router (H-MAR), the IP flow is delivered as for any standard IPv6 node.  
		The anchoring function at the H-MAR is thus managing traffic indirection only if one, or several, IP flow(s) are moved
		to another interface, and for subsequent movements while the initial anchored flows remain active. 
		This anchoring is performed on a per-flow basis and each H-MAR needs to track all possible V-MARs for a given host on the move.
		The H-MAR must also manage different tunnels for a given mobile node providing that the node is multihomed and it simultaneously
		processes different IP flows on its interfaces. 
    </t>
	
	<t>
		Lets consider a simple example to illustrate the dynamic per-flow mobility anchoring.
		<xref target="fig.dmaFlow"/> depicts the IP flow mobility management for a mobile node with two interfaces. 
		The IP data flows, Flow#1 and Flow#2, have been initiated on if1. Thus, Flow#1 and Flow#2, using respecively prefixes HNP1 and HNP2, 
		are anchored to MAR1. Referring to the picture, Flow#1 has not been moved; so Flow#1 is delivered in a standard IPv6 way. 
		Flow#2 has been transferred from If1 to If2, so Flow#2 packets, corresponding to HNP2, are tunneled from MAR1 to MAR2.
		In other words, MAR1 and MAR2 are respectively the H-MAR anchor and the V-MAR for flow#2.
