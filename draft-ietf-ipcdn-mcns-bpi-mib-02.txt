This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for
SNMP-based (Simple Network Management Protocol) management of the
Baseline Privacy Interface (BPI), which provides data privacy for
DOCSIS 1.0 (Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications)
compliant Cable Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems.  This MIB
is defined as an extension to the DOCSIS Radio Frequency Interface
MIB, RFC 2670. 
 
This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the
SMIv2 (Structure of Management Information Version 2).  The set of
objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP
standards.
 
CableLabs requires the implementation of this MIB in DOCSIS 1.0 cable
modems that implement the Baseline Privacy Interface, as a
prerequisite for DOCSIS 1.0 certification.

This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of this
