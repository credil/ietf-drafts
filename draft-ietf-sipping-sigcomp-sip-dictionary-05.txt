The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a text-based protocol for
initiating and managing communication sessions.  The protocol can be
compressed by using Signaling Compression (SigComp).  Similarly, the
Session Description Protocol (SDP) is a text-based protocol intended
for describing multimedia sessions for the purposes of session
announcement, session invitation, and other forms of multimedia
session initiation.  This memo defines the SIP/SDP-specific static
dictionary that SigComp may use in order to achieve higher efficiency.
The dictionary is compression algorithm independent.

This document is a product of the Session Initiation Proposal
Investigation Working Group and the Session Initiation Working Group
of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
