Abstract 
    
   This document defines an IPv4 DHCP Option and related behaviours to 
   allocate the same IPv4 address to multiple nodes by sharing the 
   available port space among them. The two sub-options defined in this 
   document specify random port allocation to nodes in order to 
   maximize the entropy of port randomization.

Port Restricted IP address assignment                   September 2010 
    
1. Introduction 
         
   There are a number of possible solutions to deal with the problem of 
   transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6; however none of them is a one fits 
   all solution.  
     
   As complementary solution for the IPv4-IPv6 coexistence period, this 
   document describes a method, using a newly defined IPv4 DHCP 
   [RFC2131] option that allows servers to assign port restricted IPv4 
   addresses to requesting clients. By assigning the same IPv4 address 
   to multiple clients, IPv4-only services will continue to be 
   delivered to subscribers without any degradation nor perceived 
   impact. Furthermore, service providers can continue to propose 
   service offerings with sustainable customer base. 
    
   The proposed solution is intended to be used by large ISPs, who as 
   of the date of writing this document, have a large enough IPv4 
   address pool to be able to allocate one public IPv4 address for each 
   and every client. They expect though that the situation is 
   unsustainable and they will soon not be able to provide every client 
   with a public IPv4 address. Such ISPs have two possibilities to 
   choose from:  
   - deploy Network Address Translation (NAT), which can be a 
   significant investment for ISPs not having NATs yet. The address 
   space limitations of [RFC1918] may even force these large ISPs to 
   deploy double NATs, which come with all the harmful behaviour of 
   Carrier Grade NATs (CGN), as described in [MAEN2008]; or  
   - allocate fragments of the same public IPv4 address directly to 
   multiple clients (which can be CPEs or end hosts), thus avoid the 
   cost of deploying multiple layers of NATs or Carrier Grade NATs. It 
   is however assumed, that the demand for IPv4 addresses will decrease 
   in the not so distant future, being taken over by IPv6, as the 
   proposal in this draft is not by any means a permanent solution for 
   the IPv4 address exhaustion problem. In fact, some presented 
   deployment scenarios require existence of IPv6 access network. 
    
   For ISPs not having NATs yet, a solution not requiring NATs would 
   probably be preferred. For some other ISPs, who already have NATs in 
   place, increasing the capacity of their NATs might be a viable 
   alternative. 
    
   In other deployment scenarios, allocation of shared addresses to 
   devices at the edge of the network would result in distribution of 
   NAT functionality to the edges, in some cases even to CPEs 
   [RFC6346]. 
    
   This document proposes to use new IPv4 DHCP Options to allocate 
   port-restricted IPv4 addresses to the clients. This method is meant 
   to be an IPv4 to IPv6 transition tool, to be only temporarily used 
   during the period when the demand for public IPv4 addresses will 
   exceed the availability of them.

Port Restricted IP address assignment                   September 2010 
    
   The port restricted IPv4 address option described in this document 
   can be used in various deployment scenarios, some of which are 
   described in [RFC6346]. 
    
    
    
2. Port Randomization 
    
   It is well documented that attackers can perform "blind" attacks 
   against transport protocols. The consequences of these attacks range 
   from throughput-reduction to broken connections or data corruption. 
   These attacks rely on the attacker's ability to guess or know the 
   five-tuple (Protocol, Source Address, Destination Address, Source 
   Port, Destination Port) that identifies the transport protocol 
   instance to be attacked. Most of these attacks can be prevented by 
   randomly selecting the client source port number such that the 
   possibility of an attacker guessing the exact value is reduced. 
   [RFC6056] defines a few algorithms which can select a random port 
   from the available port range. Clients usually have the (1024, 
   65535) port range at their disposal to select a random, not yet used 
   port. 
    
   When an IP address is allocated to multiple clients, the source port 
   range has to be divided between the clients. The smaller the port 
   range, the easier is for an attacker to guess the next port the 
   client is going to use. Therefore, it is imperative to divide the 
   port range between clients sharing the same IP address in such a way 
   that random selection is preserved. This document proposes two 
   different methods for port allocation, which preserves partly or 
   completely the randomness of the source ports: 
    
      o The first mechanism uses a port mask with a bit locator to 
        communicate a range or multiple ranges of ports to a client. 
        Randomness is preserved when the client is able to select a 
        port randomly across all the available port ranges. The 
        algorithms described in [RFC6056] can be used to select a 
        random port from one port range, but implementations may find 
        it difficult to select random ports across port ranges. Another 
        alternative is to assign noncontiguous port ranges. Guessing a 
        port number within a non-contiguous port ranges is not trivial.  
         
      o The second mechanism uses a cryptographic function to pre-
        allocate random ports from the entire port range. The key and 
        other input parameters are communicated to the client, which 
        can calculate the ports it can use, just as the server pre-
        calculates them. The 'side effect' of this mechanism is that 
        the client is forced to use random ports, as the random ports 
        allowed to be used by the client are pre-allocated by the 
        server.

4. Port Mask Sub-Option Usage 
    
   The port mask sub-option is used to specify one or multiple range of 
   ports pertaining to the given IP address.  
    
   Concretely, this option is used to notify a remote DHCP client about 
   the Port Mask to be applied when selecting a port value as a source 
   port. The Port Mask option is used to infer a set of allowed port 
   values. A Port Mask defines a set of ports that all have in common a 
   subset of pre-positioned bits. This ports set is also called Port 
   Range. Two port numbers are said to belong to the same Port Range if 
   and only if, they have the same Port Mask. 
    
   A Port Mask contains two fields: Port Range Value and Port Range 
   Mask.  
    
   - The 'Port Range Value' field indicates the value of the 
   significant bits of the Port Mask. The 'Port Range Value' is coded as 
   follows:  
           - The significant bits are those where "1" values are set in 
   the Port Range Mask. These bits may take a value of "0" or "1 ".  
           - All the other bits (non significant ones) are set to "0". 
    
   - The 'Port Range Mask' field indicates the position of the 
   significant bits identified by the bit(s) set to "1".

Port Restricted IP address assignment                   September 2010 
    
   The Port Range Value field indicates the value of the mask to be 
   applied and the Port Range Mask field indicates the position of the 
   bits which are used to build the mask. The "1" values in the Port 
   Range Mask field indicate by their position the significant bits of 
   the Port Range Value (the pattern of the Port Range Value). 
    
   For example: 
        - A Port Range Mask field equal to 1000000000000000 indicates 
        that the first bit (the most significant one) is used as a 
        pattern of the Port Range Value field; 
         
        - A Port Range Mask field equal to 0000101000000000 indicates 
        that the 5th and the 7th most significant bits are used as a 
        pattern of the Port Range Value. 
    
   The pattern of the Port Range Value is all the fixed bits in the 
   Port Range Value. All the ports the CPE is allowed to use as source 
   ports must have their number in accordance with the pattern. 
    
   The Port Range Value is coded as follows: 
        - The pattern bits of the Port Range Value are those where "1" 
        values are set in the Port Range Mask.  These bits may take a 
        value of 0 or 1. 
        - All the other bits are set to "0". 
         
4.1 Illustration Examples 
    
   In each of the three examples below allocation of 2048 ports is done 
   differently. In all examples it is possible for 32 nodes to share 
   the same public IPv4 address. The 4th example illustrates the 
   ability of the procedure to enforce a balanced distribution of port 
   numbers including the well-known-port values. 
 
   a) the following Port Range Mask and Port Range Value are conveyed 
   using DHCP to assign a Port Range (from 2048 to 4095) to a given 
   device: 
        - Port Range Value: 0000100000000000 (2048) 
        - Port Range Mask: 1111100000000000 (63488) 
    
   b) Unlike the previous example, this one illustrates the case where 
   a non Contiguous Port Range is assigned to a given customer's 
   device. In this example, the Port Range Value defines 128 Contiguous 
   Port Ranges, each one with a length of 16 port values.  Note that 
   the two first Port Ranges are both in the well-known ports span 
   (i.e., 0-1023) but these two ranges are not adjacent. 
    
   The following Port Range Mask and Port Range Value are conveyed in 
   DHCP messages: 
        - Port Range Value : 0000000001010000 (80) 
        - Port Range Mask : 0000000111110000 (496)

Port Restricted IP address assignment                   September 2010 
    
   This means that the 128 following Contiguous Port Ranges are 
   assigned to the same device: 
        - from 80 to 95 
        - from 592 to 607 
        - ... 
        - from 65104 to 65119 
    
   c) In this example, the Port Range Value defines two Contiguous Port 
   Ranges, each one being 1024 ports long: 
    
        - Port Range Value : 0000000000000000 (0) 
        - Port Range Mask : 1111010000000000 (62464) 
    
   This means that the two following Contiguous Port Ranges are 
   assigned to the same device: 
        - from 0 to 1023, and 
        - from 2048 to 3071 
    
   d) In this example, 64 contiguous Port Ranges are allocated to each 
   CPE (among a set of 4 CPEs sharing the same IPv4 address). 
    
   Among the 64 Contiguous Port Ranges to each CPE, there is always one 
   within the span of the first 1024 well-known port values. Hereafter 
   is given the Port Range Value and Port Range Mask assigned to 2 CPEs 
   (CPE#0 and CPE#3, CPE#1 and CPE#2 being not represented here): 
    
   1.  CPE#0 
    
        - Port Range Value: 0000000000000000 (0) 
        - Port Range Mask:  0000001100000000 (768) 
    
   The CPE#0 has therefore the 64 following Contiguous Port Ranges: 
        - 1st range: 0-255 
        - ... 
        - 64th range: 64512-64767 
    
   2.  CPE#3 
    
        - Port Range Value: 0000001100000000 (768) 
        - Port Range Mask:  0000001100000000 (768) 
    
   The CPE#2 has therefore the 64 following Contiguous Port Ranges: 
        - 1st range: 768-1023 
        - ... 
        - 64th range: 65280-65535 
    
5. Random Port Delegation Function 
    
   Delegating random ports can be achieved by defining a function which 
   takes as input a key 'k' and an integer 'x' within the range (1024, 
   65535) and produces an output 'y' also within the range (1024, 
   65535).

Port Restricted IP address assignment                   September 2010 
    
    
   The server uses a cryptographical mechanism (described below) to 
   select the random ports for each node. Instead of assigning a range 
   of ports using port mask to the client, the server sends the inputs 
   of a predefined cryptographic mechanism: a key, an initial value, 
   and the number of ports assigned to this node. The client can then 
   calculate the full list of assigned ports itself. 
    
   The cryptographical mechanism ensures that the entire 64k port range 
   can be efficiently distributed to multiple nodes in a way that when 
   nodes calculate the ports, the results will never overlap with ports 
   other nodes have calculated (property of permutation), and ports in 
   the reserved range (smaller than 1024) are not used. As the 
   randomization is done cryptographically, an attacker seeing a node 
   using some port X cannot determine which other ports the node may be 
   using (as the attacker does not know the key). 
    
   Calculation of the random port list is done as follows:  
    
   The cryptographic mechanism uses an encryption function y = E(K,x) 
   that takes as input a key K (for example, 128 bits) and an integer x 
   (the plaintext) in range (1024, 65535), and produces an output y 
   (the ciphertext), also an integer in range (1024, 65535). This 
   section describes one such encryption function, but others are also 
   possible. 
    
   The server will select the key K. When server wants to allocate e.g. 
   2048 random ports, it selects a starting point 'a' (1024 <= a <= 
   65536-2048) in a way that the range (a, a+2048) does not overlap 
   with any other active client, and calculates the values E(K,a), 
   E(K,a+1), E(K,a+2), ..., E(K,a+2046), E(K,a+2047). These are the 
   port numbers allocated for this node. Instead of sending the port 
   numbers individually, the server just sends the values 'K', ' a', 
   and '2048'. The client will then repeat the same calculation. 
    
   The server SHOULD use different K for each IPv4 address it allocates 
   to make attacks as difficult as possible. This way, learning the K 
   used in IPv4 address IP1 would not help in attacking IPv4 address 
   IP2 that is allocated by the same server to different nodes. 
    
   With typical encryption functions (such as AES and DES), the input 
   (plaintext) and output (ciphertext) are blocks of some fixed size; 
   for example, 128 bits for AES, and 64 bits for DES. For port 
   randomization, we need an encryption function whose input and output 
   is an integer in range (1024, 65535). 
    
   One possible way to do this is to use the 'Generalized-Feistel 
   Cipher' [CIPHERS] construction by Black and Rogaway, with AES as the 
   underlying round function. 
    
   This would look as follows (using pseudo-code):

        def E(k, x): 
            y = Feistel16(k, x) 
            if y >= 1024: 
                  return y 
            else: 
                  return E(k, y) 
    
   Note that although E(k,x) is recursive, it is guaranteed to 
   terminate. The average number of iterations is just slightly over 1. 
    
   Feistel16 is a 16-bit block cipher: 
    
        def Feistel16(k, x): 
            left = x & 0xff 
            right = x >> 8 
            for round = 1 to 3: 
                temp = left ^ FeistelRound(k, round, right)) 
                left = right 
                right = temp 
            return (right << 8) | left 
    
   The Feistel round function uses: 
    
        def FeistelRound(k, round, x): 
            msg[0] = round 
            msg[1] = x 
            msg[2...15] = 0 
            return AES(k, msg)[0] 
    
   Performance: To generate list of 2048 port numbers, about 6000 calls 
   to AES are required (i.e., encrypting 96 kilobytes). Thus, it will 
   not be a problem for any device that can do, for example, HTTPS (web 
   browsing over SSL/TLS). 
    
   Other port generator functions may be predefined in Standards Track 
   documents and allocated a not yet allocated 'function' value within 
   the corresponding sub-option type field. 
    
6. Option Usage  
        
6.1 Client Behaviour  
        
   A DHCP client which supports the option defined in this document 
   MUST support both sub-option types. 
    
   A DHCP client which supports the extensions defined in this 
   document, SHOULD insert the option OPTION-IPv4-PRA with both sub-
   option types into DHCPDISCOVER message to explicitly let the server 
   know that it supports port restricted IPv4 addresses. 
      o In the port mask sub-option type, the client SHALL set the IPv4 
        address and Mask Locator fields to all zeros. The client MAY

Port Restricted IP address assignment                   September 2010 
    
        indicate the number of desired ports in Port Range Value-field, 
        or set that to all zeroes. 
      o In the random port delegation sub-option type, the client SHALL 
        set the IPv4 address field, key field and starting point field 
        to all zeros. The client MAY indicate in function field which 
        encryption function it prefers, and in the number of delegated 
        ports field the number of ports the client would desire. 
      
   When a client, which supports the option defined in this document, 
   receives a DHCPOFFER with the 'yiaddr' (client IP address) field set 
   to 0.0.0.0, it SHOULD check for the presence of OPTION-IPv4-PRA 
   option. If the option is present, the client MAY send a DHCPREQUEST 
   message and insert the option OPTION-IPv4-PRA with the corresponding 
   sub-option received in the OPTION-IPv4-PRA option of the previous 
   DHCPOFFER. The client MUST NOT include a 'Requested IP Address' DHCP 
   option (code 50) into this DHCPREQUEST.  
    
   The client MUST NOT insert the IP address received in OPTION-IPv4-
   PRA into the 'Requested IP Address' DHCP option (Code 50).  
    
   When the client receives a DHCPACK message with an option 43 
   containing OPTION-IPv4-PRA option  and a sub-option field 1 or 2, it 
   MAY start using the specified IP address in conjunction with the 
   source ports specified by the mechanism chosen by DHCP server. The 
   client SHOULD NOT use the IP address with different source port 
   numbers, as that may result in the packets being NATed, as described 
   in [RFC6346].  
    
    
    
   In case the initial port set received by the client from the server 
   is exhausted and the client needs additional ports, it MAY request 
   so by sending a new DHCPDISCOVER message.  
        
   In some deployment scenarios the DHCP client may also act as a DHCP 
   server for a network behind it, in which case the node may further 
   split the allocated set for other nodes.  
    
   The allocated port-restricted IP address and all the associated 
   parameters are valid until indicated in the IP Address Lease Time 
   Option (option 51). 
    
     
6.2 Server Behaviour  
    
   When a server, which supports the option defined in this document, 
   receives a DHCPDISCOVER message, it SHOULD check for the presence of 
   the option OPTION-IPv4-PRA.  
    
   If OPTION-IPv4-PRA is not present in DHCPDISCOVER, the server SHOULD 
   allocate full unrestricted public or private [RFC1918] IPv4 address

Port Restricted IP address assignment                   September 2010 
    
   to the client, if available, by generating a DHCPOFFER as described 
   in [RFC2131].  
        
   The server SHOULD offer the port restricted IPv4 address with option  
   OPTION-IPv4-PRAwhen the server has support for the extensions 
   specified in this document and when the:  
      o DHCP client has included an OPTION-IPv4-PRA option, and server's 
        policy indicates saving unrestricted IPv4 addresses for clients 
        that do not support the extensions defined in this document. 
        The server MUST include only one of the sub-options into the 
        OPTION-IPv4-PRA option. 
    
      o server receives a DHCPDISCOVER message and server can only 
        offer port restricted IP address to the client  
      o server receives a DHCPDISCOVER message from a client without 
        the OPTION-IPv4-PRA, but knows by means outside the scope of 
        this document that the client supports the usage of port-
        restricted IPv4 addresses (or it is only entitled to be 
        provisioned with such addresses) 
        
   When server chooses to offer port restricted IPv4 address for 
   clients with OPTION-IPv4-PRA, it MUST: 
      o set the 'yiaddr' (client IP address) field of the DHCPOFFER 
        message to 0.0.0.0 
      o choose the port allocation mechanisms, if it is not statically 
        configured 
      o select a port restricted IPv4 address to be allocated for the 
        client 
      o generate parameters required for the chosen port allocation 
        mechanism  
       
   When the server receives a DHCPREQUEST message from the client with 
   OPTION-IPv4-PRA option field containing the IP address and port 
   allocation mechanism parameters it has previously offered to the 
   client, the server MUST send a DHCPACK, where the 'yiaddr' (client 
   IP address) field is set to 0.0.0.0 and the option OPTION-IPv4-PRA 
   option including the IPv4 address and parameters required for the 
   used allocation mechanism.  
        
   When the server receives a DHCPREQUEST message from the client with 
   an OPTION-IPv4-PRA option field containing an IPv4 address and port 
   set it has previously not offered to the client, the server MUST 
   send a DHCPNAK to the client.  
        
   When the server detects that a client (e.g. based on a specific 
   hardware address) which has already been allocated with a port 
   restricted IPv4 address, sent another DHCPDISCOVER, it MAY, based on 
   local policy, offer the client with additional port restricted IPv4 
   address.

   If the server is deployed in a cascaded DHCP server scenario, the 
   node MAY both act as a DHCP client for another server and DHCP 
   server for other DHCP clients. 
        
   A server SHOULD ensure the client is residing on an access link 
   where usage of port-restricted addresses is not causing problems, 
   before allocating it a port restricted IPv4 address. 
    
    
   The server MUST keep lease times per allocated port sets of the 
   shared IP addresses, in case they are delegated to the client. 
    
    
    
 
8. IANA considerations 
    
   This document defines a new DHCPv4 option as described in section 3: 
   Port Restricted IP Address Option for DHCPv4 (OPTION-IPv4-PRA) TBD. 
        
9. Security considerations 
    
   The solution is generally vulnerable to DoS when used in shared 
   medium or when access network authentication is not a prerequisite 
   to IP address assignment. The solution SHOULD only be used on point-
   to-point links, tunnels, and/or in environments where authentication 
   at link layer is performed before IP address assignment, and not 
   shared medium.  
    
   The cryptographically random port delegation mechanism is vulnerable 
   for blind attacks initiated by nodes located in the same 
   administrative domain, served by the same DHCP server, and that are 
   sharing the same public IPv4 address, and therefore have knowledge 
   of the cryptographic key used for that particular public IPv4 
   address.
