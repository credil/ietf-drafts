    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the method for transporting Timing messages such as 
          PTP and NTP over an MPLS network.  The method allows for the easy 
          identification of these PDUs at the port level to allow for port level 
          processing of these PDUs in both LERs and LSRs. </t>
           
           <t>The basic idea is to transport Timing messages inside dedicated MPLS 
          LSPs.  These LSPs only carry timing messages and possibly Control and 
          Management packets, but they do not carry customer traffic. </t>
           
           <t>Two methods for transporting Timing messages over MPLS are defined.  The 
          first method is to transport Timing messages directly over the dedicated 
          MPLS LSP via UDP/IP encapsulation, which is suitable for MPLS networks. 
          The second method is to transport Timing messages inside a PW via 
          Ethernet encapsulation, which is suitable for both MPLS and MPLS-TP      
          networks. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The objective of Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and Network Timing 
          Protocol (NTP) are to synchronize independent clocks running on separate 
          nodes of a distributed system. </t>
           
           
         <t>   <xref target="IEEE" />  defines PTP messages for frequency, phase and time 
          synchronization.  The PTP messages include PTP PDUs over UDP/IP (Annex D 
          and E of <xref target="IEEE" />) and PTP PDUs over Ethernet (Annex F of [IEEE-
          1588]).  This document defines mapping and transport of the PTP messages 
          defined in <xref target="IEEE" /> over MPLS/MPLS-TP networks. PTP defines several 
          clock types: ordinary clocks, boundary clocks, end-to-end transparent 
          clocks, and peer-to-peer transparent clocks. Transparent clocks require 
          intermediate nodes to update correction field inside PTP message that 
          reflects the transit time in the node. </t>
           
          <t>  <xref target="RFC5905" /> defines NTP messages for clock and time synchronization.  The 
          PTP messages (PDUs) are transported over UDP/IP. This document defines 
          mapping and transport of the NTP messages defined in <xref target="RFC5905" /> over MPLS 
          networks. </t>
            
          <t>  One key attribute of all of these Timing messages is that the Timestamp 
          processing should occur as close as possible to the actual transmission 
          and reception at the physical port interface.  This targets optimal time 
          and/or frequency recovery by avoiding variable delay introduced by queues 
          internal to the clocks.   </t>
           
          <t>  To facilitate the fast and efficient recognition of Timing messages at 
          the port level when the Timing messages are carried over MPLS LSPs, this 
          document defines the specific encapsulations that should be used.  In 
          addition, it can be expected that there will exist LSR/LERs where only a 
          subset of the physical ports will have the port-based Timing message 
          processing capabilities.  In order to ensure that the LSPs carrying 
          Timing packets always enter and exit ports with this capability, routing 
          extensions are defined to advertise this capability on a port basis and 
          to allow for the establishment of LSPs that only transit such ports.  
          While this path establishment restriction may be applied only at the LER 
          Ingress and/or egress ports, it becomes more important when using 
          transparent clock capable LSRs in the path. </t>
           
          <t>  Port based Timing message processing involves Timing message recognition.  
          Once the Timing messages are recognized they can be modified based on the 
          reception or transmission timestamp.   </t>
           
          <t>  This document provides two methods for transporting Timing messages over 
          MPLS. One is applicable to MPLS environment and the other one is 
          applicable to both MPLS and MPLS-TP environment.  </t>
           
          <t>  The solution involves transporting Timing messages over dedicated LSPs 
          called Timing LSPs. These LSPs carry Timing messages and MAY carry 
          Management and control messages, but not data plane client traffic. 
          Timing LSPs can be established statically or via signaling. Extensions to 
          control plane (OSPF, ISIS, etc) is required to enable routers to 
          distribute their Timing processing capabilities over MPLS to other 
          routers. However such extensions are outside the scope of this document. </t>
            
          <t>  Extensions to signaling protocols (e.g., RSVP-TE) are required for 
          establishing PTP LSPs. However such extensions are outside the scope of 
          this document. </t>
           
          <t>  While the techniques included herein allow for the establishment of paths 
          optimized to include Time-stamping capable links, the performance of the 
          Slave clocks is outside the scope of this document. </t>

    <section title="Problem Statement">
      <t><xref target="IEEE" /> has defined methods for transporting PTP messages over 
          Ethernet and IP networks. <xref target="RFC5905" /> has defined the method of 
          transporting NTP messages over IP networks. There is a need to transport 
          Timing messages over MPLS networks while supporting the Transparent Clock 
          (TC), Boundary Clock (BC) and Ordinary Clock (OC) functionality in the 
          LER and LSRs in the MPLS network.     </t>
           
            <t> There are multiple ways of transporting Timing over MPLS. However, there   
          is a requirement to limit the possible encapsulation options to simplify   
          the Timing message identification and processing required at the port 
          level.    </t>
           
           
            <t> When Timing-awareness is needed, Timing messages should not be 
          transported over LSPs or PWs that are carrying customer traffic because 
          LSRs perform Label switching based on the top label in the stack.  To   
          detect Timing messages inside such LSPs require special hardware to do   
          deep packet inspection at line rate.  Even if such hardware exists, the 
          payload cant be deterministically identified by LSRs because the payload 
          type is a context of the PW label, and the PW label and its context are 
          only known to the Edge routers (PEs/LERs); LSRs dont know what is a PWs 
          payload (Ethernet, ATM, FR, CES, etc).  Even if one restricts an LSP to 
          only carry Ethernet PWs, the LSRs dont have the knowledge of whether PW 
          Control Word (CW) is present or not and therefore can not deterministically 
          identify the payload.  </t>
           
          <t> A generic method is defined in this document that does not require deep 
          packet inspection at line rate, and can deterministically identify Timing 
          messages.  The generic method is applicable to MPLS and MPLS-TP networks. </t>

    <section title="Timing over MPLS Architecture">
      <t>Timing messages are exchange between Timing ports on ordinary and 
          boundary clocks. Boundary clocks terminate the Timing messages and act as 
          master for other boundary clocks or for slave clocks. Transparent clocks 
          do not terminate the Timing messages but they do modify the contents of 
          the Timing messages as they transit across the transparent clock.   </t>
           
         <t> Master/Slave clock could be integrated in the LERs. An example is shown 
          in Figure 1, where the LERs act as Ordinary Clock (OC) and are the 
          initiating/terminating point for Timing messages. The ingress LER 
          encapsulates the Timing messages in Timing LSP and the Egress LER 
          terminates the Timing LSP. The LSRs act as Transparent Clock (TC) and 
          just update the Timing field in the Timing messages.   </t>

    <section title="Dedicated LSPs for Timing messages">

      <t>Many methods have been considered for identifying the Timing messages 
          when they are encapsulated in MPLS such as using GAL/ACH or a new 
          reserved label.  These methods were not attractive since they either 
          required deep packet inspection at line rate in the intermediate LSRs or 
          they required use of a scarce new reserved label.  Also one of the goals 
          was to reuse existing OAM mechanisms. </t>
           
       <t>      The method defined in this document can be used by LER and LSRs to 
          identify Timing messages in MPLS tunnels by just looking at the top label 
          in the MPLS label stack, which only carry Timing messages as well as OAM, 
          but not data plane client traffic. </t>
           
        <t>     Compliant implementations MUST use dedicated LSPs to carry Timing 
          messages over MPLS.  These LSPs are herein referred to as "Timing LSPs" 
          and the labels associated with these LSPs as "Timing LSP labels". The 
          Timing LSPs that runs between Ingress and Egress LERs MUST be co-routed.  
          Alternatively, a single bidirectional co-routed LSP can be used.  </t>
           
          <t>   Co-routing of the two directions is required to limit the difference in 
          the delays in the Master clock to Slave clock direction compared to the 
          Slave clock to Master clock direction. The Timing LSP MAY be MPLS LSP or 
          MPLS-TP LSP.   </t>
           
         <t>    The Timing LSPs could be configured or signaled via RSVP-TE/GMPLS.  New 
          Extensions to RSVP-TE/GMPLS TLVs are required; however they are outside 
          the scope of this document.  </t>
           
          <t>   The Timing LSPs MAY carry essential MPLS/MPLS-TP OAM traffic such as BFD 
          and LSP Ping but the LSP data plane client plane traffic MUST be Timing 
          packets only. </t>

    <section title="Timing over LSP Encapsulation ">
      <t>This document defines two methods for carrying Timing messages over MPLS.  
          The first method is carrying UDP/IP encapsulated Timing messages over 
          Timing LSPs, which is suitable for MPLS networks and the second method, 
          is carrying Ethernet encapsulated Timing messages over Ethernet PWs 
          inside Timing LSPs, which is suitable for MPLS and MPLS-TP networks. </t>

      <section  title="Timing over UDP/IP over MPLS Encapsulation ">
        <t>The simplest method of transporting Timing messages over MPLS is to 
          encapsulate Timing PDUs in UDP/IP and then encapsulate them in Timing 
          LSP. This format is shown in Figure 4. </t>

        <t>This encapsulation is very simple and is useful when the network between

            <t> In order for an LER/LSR to process Timing messages, the Timing LSP Label

          information. Such new encapsulations are outside the scope of this

    <section anchor="TimingMessageProcessing" title="Timing Message Processing">
      <t>Each Timing protocol such as PTP and NTP, define their set of Timing 
          messages. For example PTP defines SYNC, DELAY_REQ, DELAY_RESP, FOLLOW_UP, 
          etc messages.  </t>
         
     <t>        Some of the Timing messages require time stamping at port level and some 
          dont. It is the job of the LER/LSR to parse the timing message and find 
          out the type of the Timing message and decide whether and how to Time-
          stamp it (e.g., BC) or modify existing timestamp in it (e.g., TC).  </t>
           
        <t>     For example the following PTP messages (called Event messages) require 
          time-stamping, while other Non-Event PTP messages do not need time-stamping.  </t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">

          <t>SYNC</t>

          <t>DELAY_REQ (Delay Request)</t>

            <t>PDELAY_REQ (Peer Delay Request)</t>

          <t>PDELAY_RESP (Peer Delay Response)</t>

          </list>
      </t>

         <t>SYNC and DELAY_REQ are exchanged between Master Clock and Slave Clock
      and MUST be transported over PTP LSPs. PDELAY_REQ and PDELAY_RESP are
      exchanged between adjacent PTP clocks (i.e. Master, Slave, Boundary, or
      Transparent) and MAY be transported over single hop PTP LSPs. If Two
      Step PTP clocks are present, then the FOLLOW_UP, DELAY_RESP, and
      PDELAY_RESP_FOLLOW_UP messages must also be transported over the PTP
      LSPs.</t>

      <t>For a given instance of 1588 protocol, SYNC and DELAY_REQ MUST be
      transported over two PTP LSPs that are in opposite directions. These PTP
      LSPs, which are in opposite directions MUST be congruent and co-routed.
      Alternatively, a single bidirectional co-routed LSP can be used.</t>

      <t>Except as indicated above for the two-step PTP clocks, Non-Event PTP
      message types do not need to be processed by intermediate routers. These
      message types MAY be carried in PTP Tunnel LSPs.</t>

    <section anchor="Protection" title="Protection and Redundancy">
      <t>In order to ensure continuous uninterrupted operation of slave clocks,   
          usually as a general practice, slave clocks (or ports) track redundant   
          master clocks. </t>
                
            <t> It is the responsibility of the network operator to ensure that 
          physically disjoint Timing LSPs are established between a slave clock (or 
          port) and redundant master clocks (or ports). </t>
           
           <t>  When a slave clock (or port) listens to redundant master clocks or ports,   
          any prolonged Timing LSP outage will trigger the slave clock or port to 
          switch to a redundant master clock or port.   </t>
           
          <t>   LSP/PW protection such as Linear protection Switching (1:1, 1+1), Ring 
          protection switching or MPLS Fast Reroute (FRR) generally switch 
          alternative path that usually cause a change in delay, which if 
          undetected by slave clock can reduce accuracy of the slave clock. However 
          it is expected that most Slave clocks could detect the change in delay.  
          Therefore this specification recommends that protection switching SHOULD 
          be used, unless the operator knows that the protection switching may have 
          adverse effect on the slave clock. </t>
           
          <t>  Note that any protection or reroute mechanism that adds additional MPLS   
          label to the label stack, such as Facility Backup Fast Reroute, MUST 
          ensure that the pushed label is also a Timing Label to ensure recognition 
          of the MPLS frame as containing Timing messages, as it transits the 
          backup path. </t>

          be the same for all Event Timing messages listed in section 7.   </t>
