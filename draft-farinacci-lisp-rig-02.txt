2.  Introduction

   LISP [RFC6830] specifies an architecture and mechanism for replacing
   the addresses currently used by IP with two separate name spaces:
   Endpoint IDs (EIDs), used within sites, and Routing Locators (RLOCs),
   used on the transit networks that make up the Internet
   infrastructure.  To achieve this separation, the Locator/ID
   Separation Protocol (LISP) defines protocol mechanisms for mapping
   from EIDs to RLOCs.  In addition, LISP assumes the existence of a
   database to store and propagate those mappings globally.  This
   document focuses on the LISP-DDT [LISP-DDT] mapping database system.

   The 'rig' is a manual management tool to query LISP-DDT mapping
   database hierarchy.  It can be run by all devices which implement
   LISP, including ITRs, ETRs, PITRs, PETRs, Map-Resolvers, Map-Servers,
   and LISP-DDT nodes, as well as by a host system at either a LISP-
   capable or non-LISP-capable site.

   The LISP-DDT 'rig' tool is similar to the 'lig' [RFC6835] tool in
   that they are both diagnostic tools to query a distributed database.
   However, 'rig' is used to find Map-Servers serving an EID-prefix,
   specifically within a LISP-DDT mapping database framework.  And 'lig'
   can be used on top of any mapping database system to retrieve
   locators used for packet encapsulation.

3.  Definition of Terms

   Endpoint ID (EID):   An EID is a 32-bit (for IPv4) or 128-bit (for
      IPv6) value used in the source and destination address fields of
      the first (most inner) LISP header of a packet.  The host obtains
      a destination EID the same way it obtains an destination address
      today, for example through a Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1034]
      lookup or Session Invitation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] exchange.
      The source EID is obtained via existing mechanisms used to set a
      host's "local" IP address.  An EID used on the public Internet
      must have the same properties as any other IP address used in that
      manner; this means, among other things, that it must be globally
      unique.  An EID is allocated to a host from an EID-prefix block
      associated with the site where the host is located.  An EID can be
      used by a host to refer to other hosts.  EIDs MUST NOT be used as
      LISP RLOCs.  Note that EID blocks MAY be assigned in a
      hierarchical manner, independent of the network topology, to
      facilitate scaling of the mapping database.  In addition, an EID
      block assigned to a site may have site-local structure
      (subnetting) for routing within the site; this structure is not
      visible to the global routing system.  In theory, the bit string
      that represents an EID for one device can represent an RLOC for a
      different device.  As the architecture is realized, if a given bit
      string is both an RLOC and an EID, it must refer to the same
      entity in both cases.  When used in discussions with other
      Locator/ID separation proposals, a LISP EID will be called a
      "LEID".  Throughout this document, any references to "EID" refers
      to an LEID.

   Extended EID (XEID):   A LISP EID, optionally extended with a non-
      zero Instance ID (IID) if the EID is intended for use in a context
      where it may not be a unique value, such as on a Virtual Private
      Network where "private" address space is used.  See "Using
      Virtualization and Segmentation with LISP" in [RFC6830] for more
      discussion of Instance IDs.

   Routing Locator (RLOC):   A RLOC is an IPv4 [RFC0791] or IPv6
      [RFC2460] address of an egress tunnel router (ETR).  A RLOC is the
      output of an EID-to-RLOC mapping lookup.  An EID maps to one or
      more RLOCs.  Typically, RLOCs are numbered from topologically-
      aggregatable blocks that are assigned to a site at each point to
      which it attaches to the global Internet; where the topology is
      defined by the connectivity of provider networks, RLOCs can be
      thought of as PA addresses.  Multiple RLOCs can be assigned to the
      same ETR device or to multiple ETR devices at a site.

   DDT Node:   A network infrastructure component responsible for
      specific XEID-prefix and for delegation of more-specific sub-
      prefixes to other DDT nodes.

   DDT Client:   A network infrastructure component that sends Map-
      Request messages and implements the iterative following of Map-
      Referral results.  Typically, a DDT client will be a Map Resolver
      but it is also possible for an ITR to implement DDT client
      functionality.  A DDT client can be a device that is originating
      'rig' requests.

   DDT Map Server:   A DDT node that also implements Map Server
      functionality (forwarding Map-Requests and/or returning Map-
      Replies if offering proxy-mode service) for a subset of its
      delegated prefixes.

   DDT Map Resolver:   A network infrastructure element that accepts a
      Map-Request, adds the XEID to its lookup queue, then queries one
      or more DDT nodes for the requested EID, following returned
      referrals until it receives one with the the ms-ack action.  This
      indicates that the Map-Request has been sent to a Map-Server that
      will forward it to an ETR that, in turn, will provide a Map-Reply
      to the original sender.  A DDT Map Resolver maintains both a cache
      of Map-Referral message results containing RLOCs for DDT nodes
      responsible for XEID-prefixes of interest (termed the "referral
      cache") plus a lookup queue of XEIDs that are being resolved
      through iterative querying of DDT nodes.

   Encapsulated Map-Request:   A LISP Map-Request carried within an
      Encapsulated Control Message, which has an additional LISP header
      prepended.  Sent to UDP destination port 4342.  The "outer"
      addresses are globally-routable IP addresses, also known as RLOCs.
      Used by an ITR when sending to a Map-Resolver and by a Map-Server
      when forwarding a Map-Request to an ETR as documented in
      [RFC6833].

   Map-Referral:   A LISP message sent by a DDT node when it receives a
      DDT Map-Request for an XEID that matches a configured XEID-prefix
      delegation.  The Map-Referral message includes a "referral", a set
      of RLOCs for DDT nodes that have more information about the sub-
      prefix; a DDT client "follows the referral" by sending another DDT
      Map-Request to one of those RLOCs to obtain either an answer or
      another referral to DDT nodes responsible for a more-specific
      XEID-prefix.

   Authoritative XEID-prefix:   An XEID-prefix delegated to a DDT node
      and for which the DDT node may provide further delegations of
      more-specific sub-prefixes.

4.  Basic Overview

   When the rig command is run, an Encapsulated Control Message Map-
   Request is sent for a destination EID.  When a LISP-DDT Map-Referral
   is returned, the contents are displayed to the user.  The information
   displayed includes:

   o  A delegated EID-prefix configured in a DDT-node or a configured
      site EID-prefix in a DDT Map-Server that matches the requested
      EID.

   o  The type of DDT-node which sent the Map-Referral.

   o  The action code and ttl set by the sender of the Map-Referral.

   o  The referral RLOC addresses from the Map-Referral message.

   o  An round-trip-time estimate for the ECM-Map-Request/Map-Referral
      message exchange.

   A possible syntax for a rig command could be:

   rig [instance-id <iid>] <eid> to <ddt-node> [follow-all-referrals]

   Parameter description:

   [instance-id <iid>]:   is the instance-ID portion of the Extended EID
      used as VPN identifer.  When the DDT hierarchy is not configured
      with instance-IDs, this argument is omitted from the command line.

   <eid>:   is either a Fully Qualified Domain Name or a destination EID
      that is being queried in the LISP-DDT mapping database.

   <ddt-node>:   is the RLOC address of any DDT-node in the DDT
      hierarchy.  This can be the DDT root node, a DDT transit node, or
      a DDT Map-Server.

   [follow-all-referrals]:   when this keyword is used each referral
      RLOC is queried so rig can descend the entire DDT hierarchy
      starting from the node <ddt-node>.  When this keyword is not used,
      one of the referral RLOCs will be selected to descend a branch of
      the DDT hierarchy.

   The rig utility not only shows you branches of the delegation
   hierarchy but can also report:

   o  When a DDT Map-Server would forward a Map-Request to the ETRs at a
      registered LISP site.  This is known as an 'ms-acknowledgement'
      action.

   o  When a DDT Map-Server sends a negative referral indicating a
      requested EID is configured but not registered to the mapping
      database system.  This is known as an 'ms-not-registered' action.

   o  When a DDT node is sending referrals for a transit or leaf node in
      the hierarchy.  These are known as 'node-referral' and 'ms-
      referral' actions, respectively.

   o  When a DDT-node finds a hole in the address space that has not
      been allocated or configured in the delegation hierarchy.  This is
      typically associated with a hole in a DDT node's configured
      authoritative prefix.  This is known as a 'delegation-hole'
      action.

   o  When a DDT-node finds a hole in the address space that has not
      been allocated or configured in the delegation hierarchy at all.
      This is typically associated with a hole that is outside of a DDT
      node's authoritative prefix.  This is known as 'non-authoritative'
      action.

   Refer to [LISP-DDT] for more detail about Map-Referral actions.

5.  Implementation Details

   The cisco LISP prototype implementations on IOS and NX-OS has rig
   support for IPv4 and IPv6 EIDs in either the default instance or a
   non-zero instance-ID.

   The IOS syntax is:

   rig [instance-id <iid>] <eid> to <ddt-node> [follow-all-referrals]

   The NX-OS syntax is:

   rig [instance-id <iid>] <hostname> | {<eid> | <eid6>}}
                           to {<ddt-hostname> | {<ddt> | <ddt6>}}

   Here is some sample IOS output:

6.  Security Considerations

   The use of rig does not affect the security of the LISP
   infrastructure as it is simply a tool that facilities diagnostic
   querying.  See [RFC6830], [LISP-DDT], and [RFC6833] for descriptions
   of the security properties of the LISP infrastructure.

   LISP rig provides easy access to the information in the public
   mapping database.  Therefore, it is important to protect the mapping
   information for private use.  This can be provided by disallowing
   access to specific mapping entries or to place such entries in a
   private mapping database system.
