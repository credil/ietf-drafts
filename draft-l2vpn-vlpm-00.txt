Abstract

    Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) as defined in RFC4761 [RFC4761] 
    and RFC4762 [RFC4762] implementations are highly susceptible to 
    layer-2 loops external to the PE customer-facing interface. Such 
    loops impact performance and can have a detrimental effect on all 
    VPLS traffic throughout the entire instance under certain 
    conditions.

    Current Layer-2 loop protection and protection mechanisms do not
    function effectively here.

    This document describes a protocol function (VPLS External Loop
    Protection Mechanism (VLPM)) to offer VPLS service providers a
    mechanism for detecting such layer-2 loops and facilitating
    configurable actions without the need for inter-operation with
    customer network protocols, other VPLS PEs or sites.

1. Introduction

    VPLS External Loop Protection Mechanism (VLPM) is an expected 
    function of an MPLS Perimeter Edge (PE) Router.
    Regardless of how physically or logically a VPLS external connection
    is made into a PE, the VPLS instance within each PE builds a per-
    instance MAC-address table much like a physical ethernet switch.

    Unlike a physical ethernet switch or a collection of them the 
    layer-2 broadcast domain of a VPLS instance straddles operational 
    boundaries between the customer and the service-provider.

    This difference, along with vendor configuration variables and
    capability, is what makes the deployment of well-known layer 2 loop
    protection and prevention mechanisms difficult and provides the need
    for VLPM.

2. Terminology

    Herein this document uses the following terminology:

    External Interface:          Any connection into a VPLS instance on
                                 a MPLS Perimeter Edge (PE) router.

    External layer-2 segment:    The per-customer-site layer-2
                                 broadcast domain that is connected to,
                                 but external of the service provider
                                 controlled VPLS instance.

    External Loop:               A loop that is a layer-2 loop itself
                                 or creates a layer-2 loop within the
                                 external layer-2 segment.

    Loop-Connected-PE:           A PE that has an interface from which
                                 an external loop is present.

    Unknown-Unicast-Probe-Frame: An ethernet frame with a specifically
    (UPF)                        assigned IANA EUI-48 Unicast MAC
                                 address used by VLPM.

3. Problem Definition and Scope

    When an external-loop is created within the VPLS broadcast domain,
    there are serious negative data-plane impacts. The scope and 
    severity of these issues varies due to several related factors. The 
    following identifies the three main contributing factors:

3.1. Type of Loop

    Including but not limited to:

    1. Layer-1 loop at the PE interface or within the same ethernet
            collision domain.
    2. Layer-2 loop external to the PE within a broadcast domain that
            includes only one PE interface.
    3. Layer-2 loop external to the PE within a broadcast domain that
            includes more than one PE interface.

    An example of each of these is shown in Figure 1 below using the
    following abbreviations:

    PE:  MPLS Perimeter Edge Router
    CS:  Customer Switch
    CR:  Customer Router

    Loops are shown by number referencing the above list. All layer-2
    links are assumed to be in the same VLAN.

3.2. Instance Specific Traffic Flow

    The extent to which traffic flows over the Loop-Connected-PE, either
    by specific instance learning restrictions or by a higher layer
    communication topology.
    At layer-2 this simply is the number of connections from the same or
    other PEs that send frames to connections on the Loop-Connected-PE.

3.3. Size of the VPLS layer-2 broadcast domain

    Determined by:

    1. Number of individual interfaces from all PEs participating in 
            the specific VPLS instance.
    2. Number of PEs containing interfaces participating in the 
            specific VPLS instance.
    3. Number of MAC-Addresses being learnt from all PE interfaces
            participating in the specific VPLS instance.
    4. OSI functional level of the device externally connected to each
            interface.

3.4. Scenario

    To understand the scope and severity of any external loop on a VPLS 
    instance,this section walks through a simplified and linear process    
    for a very basic three-site VPLS instance sending very occasional 
    frames based on the topology in Figure 2 below.

                      (Loop)
                      +----+
                      |PC C|
                      +----+

Example.

    1. PC B sends a frame to PC C
    2. PE 1 adds PC Bs MAC-Address to its MAC-Table for this VPLS
           instance.
    3. Due to a previous MAC-Table entry on PE1 (created by a frame from PC C sent when 
       the loop was not present) the frame is unicast out the interface connecting to 
       PC C.
    4. The frame loops back at the external loop to PE1.
    5. PE1 now learns that the MAC-Address of PC B is out the interface
            towards PC C.
    6. Now PC A sends a frame to PC B
    7. PE3 has a previous entry in its MAC-Table to send it to PE1
    8. PE1 sends the frame to the interface towards PC C
    9. The frame now loops back into PE1 with the source-address of PC A
    10. PC B now sends a frame to PC A which is now sent to the    
            interface towards PC C and may never get to PC A.

    As is clear, this example is highly simplified. Due to traffic 
    streams MAC-learning would be flapping for all unicast frames sent 
    towards the loop on PE 1. At a certain rate this will cause flooding 
    of what should be known unicast frames which then propagates looped 
    frames to other PEs in the VPLS instance. This in-turn populates 
    their MAC-Address tables with incorrect information.

    This has the affect of sending more traffic towards the loop thus
    creating more and more MAC-Table instability and thus more flooding
    which, without interruption, will eventually prevent higher layer
    protocols from functioning.

    The affect of the above in a real-world network with 1000s of 
    traffic flows and expected legitimate broadcast traffic can result 
    in total loss of service for the entire VPLS instance within a very 
    short timeframe.

4. Requirement

    Ethernet loop protection and protection is nothing new. There are
    several clearly defined and adopted protocols for this function and
    it is not the intent of this document to discuss any one or all or
    these in relation to VLPM except to identify requirement that are 
    not addressed by such protocols.

    These requirements are detailed here:

    1. The protection mechanism MUST be configurable solely on the    
            service provider PE router, independent of customer device 
            capability and configuration within the scope of industry 
            standard default behavior of such devices.
    2. The protection mechanism MUST be able to be deployed on a per-
            interface basis as well as globally per-PE, per-VPLS 
            instance.

   Internet Draft        draft-l2vpn-vlpm-00.txt

    3. The protection mechanism MUST have no dependencies to the extent 
            to which it may or may not be deployed on other interfaces,   
            other interfaces in the same VPLS instance on other PEs, or    
            other VPLS instances, except for necessary hardware 
            limitations on the number of interfaces consecutively 
            supported per device.
    4. The protection mechanism MUST NOT require a topographical view of
            the network.
    5. The protection mechanism MUST NOT alter or be dependent upon 
            other frames transmitted within the layer-2 broadcast 
            domain.
    6. The protection mechanism MUST NOT restrict or in any way   
            interfere with the operation of other protocols deployed 
            within the layer-2 broadcast domain, including other layer-2 
            broadcast protection mechanisms except for when a loop-
            condition is detected and the configured action has indirect 
            affects.
    7. The protection mechanism MUST provide per-VPLS instance and per-
            interface level configurable parameters for protection 
            options and loop-condition actions.

5. Method of Operation

    To meet the requirements noted above, VLPM operates in the following
    method.

5.1. Standard function

    A customer-facing PE MUST send an untagged ethernet frame from every
    external interface within a VPLS instance that is configured for   
    VLPM using the VPLS instance or interface specific configured VLPM  
    parameters.

    Each frame MUST be sourced from the specific external-interface 
    using the BIA MAC-address of that interface and MUST use a fixed,    
    specific destination MAC-address that is defined and allocated by 
    IANA as an EUI-64 unicast MAC-address solely for this function of 
    VLPM.

    This frame is referred to as the VLPM Unknown-Unicast-Probe-Frame   
    or UPF and is expected to be processed and treated as any unknown
    unicast frame within a layer-2 broadcast domain by all devices.

    It is expected and REQUIRED that split-horizon rule is in effect by
    default on all layer-2 devices within the external layer-2 broadcast
    domain - i.e. the frame is flooded to all ports on a device except 
    the ingress port, thus being propagated throughout the entirety of
    the external layer-2 segment.

   Boldy                 Expires September, 2013                  Page 8 

   Internet Draft        draft-l2vpn-vlpm-00.txt

    Each UPF MUST be generated by the PE at a default, per-interface or
    per-vpls-instance set interval of time. It is expected that the
    required minimum generation rate can be very low ~ 1 Frame Per 
    Second (FPS) but should be configurable. The rate at which an 
    interface sends the UPF correlates to the speed at which a loop can 
    be recognized by VLPM to a certain extent, however past a certain 
    ceiling it is expected to plateau.

5.2. No-Loop condition behavior

    When no loop is present within the external layer-2 segment the
    following is REQUIRED:

    * The UPF SHOULD propagate through the entirety of the segment
    * The UPF and all copies SHOULD be eventually discarded
    * The PE emanating interface SHALL NOT receive the UPF
    * Other PE interface within the VPLS instance SHALL NOT receive the
            UPF.

5.3. Loop-present condition behavior

    When a loop is present within the external layer-2 segment the
    following is REQUIRED:

    * The UPF SHOULD propagate through the entirety of the segment that 
            is not restricted by the loop.
    * The PE emanating interface SHOULD receive the UPF or a copy of it.
    * Other PE interface within the VPLS instance MAY receive the UPF 
            only if connected to the same logical external layer-2 
            segment where the loop resides, either by design or error.
    * Any PE that is configured for VLPM, and receives a UPF on a VLPM
            active interface, MUST drop the frame after it has been 
            processed by VLPM. A UPF MUST NOT be forwarded within the   
            VPLS instance or locally switched at the PE.

5.4. Standard configurable variables

    The PE interface or VPLS Instance that supports VLPM MUST allow for
    the configuration of the following variables:

    * Frequency of the UPF generation in Frames per second (FPS) between 
            1 and 60. (UPF Generation Frequency).
    * Frequency threshold of UPFs received in order to trigger   
            configured actions. (UPF Trigger Frequency).
    * Source MAC-Address action-list. Either configured on the 
            interface specifically or by means of a reference to a mac-
            access-list.
    * Source MAC-Address ignore-list. Either configured on the 
            interface specifically or by means of a reference to a mac-
            access-list.

   Internet Draft        draft-l2vpn-vlpm-00.txt

    The configurable UPF Trigger Frequency MUST NOT exceed the 
    configured UPF Generation Frequency.
    VLPM MUST NOT be configurable on internally facing virtual VPLS
    interfaces.

5.5. Standard configurable actions

    The PE interface or VPLS Instance that supports VLPM MUST allow for
    the configuration of the following actions upon receipt of a UPF:

    * No action.
    * Any other allowable configured action only if the source MAC          
            address of the UPF is not in the configured ignore-list.
    * Any other configured action only if the source MAC Address of the
            UPF is included in the configured action-list.
    * Creation of a syslog message.
    * Sending of an SNMP trap message.
    * Disabling MAC address learning in the VPLS instance for the 
            external interface.
    * Discarding all traffic to and from the external interface for a
            configurable hold-time.
    * Disabling flooding of frames received from and to the associated
            interface.
    * Disabling of the associated logical or physical external interface
            requiring manual enabling (e.g. error-disable state)

    These actions MUST be configurable independently of each other and
    in combination with each other where logic permits. For example, it 
    MUST be possible to configure the sending of an SNMP trap, sending a 
    syslog message and disabling the external interface due to the 
    receipt of a UPFs that cross the configured UPF trigger threshold.

6. Common Concerns & Backfire Theory

    Backfire is the technique of setting a smaller, controlled, fire to
    contain a larger wildfire. On the surface this technique of starting 
    a fire to prevent a fire can be seen as strange. In the same way,
    sending of intentional unknown unicast frames into a layer-2 
    broadcast domain that may contain a loop may seem to be counter  
    intuitive on the surface. However, it should be understood in the 
    following context:

    * The expected required and configurable frame-rate of VLPM is very
            low. Under loop condition it is expected that the volume of
            other broadcast, multicast or unknown unicast frames within
            the external layer-2 broadcast domain would vastly outweigh
            any VLPM frames making their negative affect exceedingly
            minimal.

    * The intent of VLPM is to protect the larger VPLS instance and the
            rest of the connected customer network (not the specific
            external layer-2 broadcast segment) from the effects of an
            external loop. To this end VLPM allows for the local segment
            to be restricted or isolated from the larger layer-2 
            broadcast domain. Once restricted or isolated from the VPLS 
            instance the condition of the layer-2 broadcast segment is 
            of no concern to VLPM other than a stable, non-loop 
            condition should exist before the segment is reconnected 
            without restriction into the VPLS instance.

    * Prevention, resolution and/or specific identification of the cause
            of any loop are outside the scope and purpose of VLPM 
            however restriction or isolation of the layer-2 broadcast 
            segment will make troubleshooting within the segment easier 
            as traffic volume should be reduced to that of only locally 
            sourced frames.

7. Existing Vendor Functions

    At the time of writing there is one proprietary vendor 
    implementation by Alcatel-Lucent known as "mac-move" that attempts 
    to address this issue. This feature works by recognizing the 
    learning of a MAC-Address on an interface that is different to an   
    interface on which it was previously learnt. Although useful this 
    feature addresses the issue from a MAC-Learning of customer traffic 
    and is susceptible to false-positives. It also is reliant upon 
    customer traffic and MAC-Learning of all customer frames which VLPM 
    is not.

    There is also a non-vendor written JunOS event-script for MX-Series
    routers that functions in a similar way to the Alcatel-Lucent TimOS
    function and thus has similar drawbacks.

8. Security Considerations

    The security considerations for VLPM are as follows:

8.1. False UPF Injection

    Injection of a UPF into the layer-2 broadcast domain from an 
    interface other than the service-provider PE interface would result 
    in a false-positive and unnecessary implementation of the 
    configured action on the PE external interface.

    To mitigate this happening accidentally it is recommended that VLPM
    only be supported on VPLS aware PE devices. To further protect 
    against this and the possibility of malicious injection of such a 
    frame the action-list and ignore-list features provides some 
    basic protection.

    It is possible however for such a malicious frame to be crafted with 
    a spoofed source MAC Address of the PE BIA interface. Such a 
    malicious attack would require knowledge and access to the customer 
    network to an extent that existing best practice security methods 
    should prevent.

8.2. UPF Propagation Failure

    Under excessive conditions any loop in a layer-2 broadcast domain   
    can result in a device ability to correctly switch traffic   
    including the expected standard behavior of flooding unknown unicast 
    frames. This MAY result in UPFs not being presented back to a VLPM 
    configured interface as expected.

    The functions of UPF generation frequency and UPF trigger frequency
    should be configured with a high level of network congestion in 
    mind.

    Where a device fails and prevents such frames from being able to be
    presented to a VLPM interface, even sporadically, it is expected 
    that this would also prevent all other frames thus rendering VLPM 
    action moot.

9. IANA Considerations

    IANA is requested to assign the registration of a specific EUI-48
    unicast MAC address for use by VLPM as its destination MAC address.
    This document makes no assumptions as to which address will or 
    should be allocation only to point to the following IANA reference 
    that shows available unallocated address space:

    http://www.iana.org/assignments/ethernet-numbers/ethernet-
    numbers.xml

    The requirement is stated as a wholly reserved and specific EUI-48
    unicast mac-address that would allow a frame to be treated, by any
    layer-2 ethernet device, as an unknown unicast frame when used as a
    destination address within an ethernet frame header.

    The need for such an address is detailed as below:

    * To ensure full propagation of the probe frame within any relevant
            broadcast domain segment.
    * To provide a non-hardware specific destination address that 
            clearly identifies the purpose and intent of the VLPM frame 
            for both identification on receipt by PE interfaces 
            configured for VLPM and general network forensic assistance.
    * To ensure that no other protocol or device can legitimately 
            generate a frame using the destination address being watch 
            for by VLPM.
    * To allow for future development of the protocol.
