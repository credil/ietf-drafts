IPv6 over Low power WPAN (6lowpan)
----------------------------------

  "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over BLUETOOTH Low Energy", Johanna
  Nieminen, Teemu Savolainen, Markus Isomaki, Basavaraj Patil, Zach
  Shelby, Carles Gomez, 12-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle-12.txt>

    BLUETOOTH Low Energy is a low power air interface technology defined
       by the BLUETOOTH Special Interest Group (BT-SIG).  The standard
       BLUETOOTH radio has been widely implemented and available in mobile
       phones, notebook computers, audio headsets and many other devices.
       The low power version of BLUETOOTH is a new specification that
       enables the use of this air interface with devices such as sensors,
       smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low power variant of BLUETOOTH is
       currently specified in the revision 4.0 of the BLUETOOTH
       specifications (BLUETOOTH 4.0).  This document describes how IPv6 is
       transported over BLUETOOTH Low Energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

IPv6 Maintenance (6man)
-----------------------

  "Considerations for IPv6 Address Selection Policy Changes", Tim Chown,
  Arifumi Matsumoto, 1-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-6man-addr-select-considerations-05.txt>

    This ducument is intended to capture the address selection design
       team's considerations about the address selection issues mainly
       raised in [RFC5220].  This considerations led to the revision of RFC
       3484 [RFC6724], and Address Selection DHCP option.  Although it does
       not perfectly match the current state, this document captures the
       past discussion and considerations for the historical record.

  "Distributing Address Selection Policy using DHCPv6", Arifumi Matsumoto,
  Tomohiro Fujisaki, Tim Chown, 29-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-6man-addr-select-opt-10.txt>

    RFC 6724 defines default address selection mechanisms for IPv6 that
       allow nodes to select an appropriate address when faced with multiple
       source and/or destination addresses to choose between.  The RFC 6724
       allowed for the future definition of methods to administratively
       configure the address selection policy information.  This document
       defines a new DHCPv6 option for such configuration, allowing a site
       administrator to distribute address selection policy overriding the
       default address selection parameters and policy table, and thus
       control the address selection behavior of nodes in their site.

  "Neighbor Unreachability Detection is too impatient", Erik Nordmark,
  Igor Gashinsky, 24-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-6man-impatient-nud-06.txt>

    IPv6 Neighbor Discovery includes Neighbor Unreachability Detection.
       That function is very useful when a host has an alternative neighbor,
       for instance when there are multiple default routers, since it allows
       the host to switch to the alternative neighbor in short time.  This
       time is 3 seconds after the node starts probing by default.  However,
       if there are no alternative neighbors, this is far too impatient.
       This document specifies relaxed rules for Neighbor Discovery
       retransmissions that allow an implementation to choose different
       timeout behavior based on whether or not there are alternative
       neighbors.  This document updates RFC 4861.

  "Enhanced Duplicate Address Detection", Rajiv Asati, Hemant Singh, Wes
  Beebee, Eli Dart, Wesley George, Carlos Pignataro, 24-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-6man-enhanced-dad-03.txt>

    Appendix A of the IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) document in
       RFC 4862 discusses Loopback Suppression and DAD.  However, RFC 4862
       does not settle on one specific automated means to detect loopback of
       Neighbor Discovery (ND of RFC 4861) messages used by DAD.  Several
       service provider communities have expressed a need for automated
       detection of looped backed ND messages used by DAD.  This document
       includes mitigation techniques and then outlines the Enhanced DAD
       algorithm to automate detection of looped back IPv6 ND messages used
       by DAD.  For network loopback tests, the Enhanced DAD algorithm
       allows IPv6 to self-heal after a loopback is placed and removed.
       Further, for certain access networks the document automates resolving
       a specific duplicate address conflict.

  "A method for Generating Stable Privacy-Enhanced Addresses with IPv6
  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)", Fernando Gont, 12-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses-10.txt>

    This document specifies a method for generating IPv6 Interface
       Identifiers to be used with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
       (SLAAC), such that addresses configured using this method are stable
       within each subnet, but the Interface Identifier changes when hosts
       move from one network to another.  This method is meant to be an
       alternative to generating Interface Identifiers based on hardware
       address (e.g., using IEEE identifiers), such that the benefits of
       stable addresses can be achieved without sacrificing the privacy of
       users.  The method specified in this document applies to all prefixes
       a host may be employing, including link-local, global, and unique-
       local addresses.

  "Security Implications of IPv6 Fragmentation with IPv6 Neighbor
  Discovery", Fernando Gont, 2-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-6man-nd-extension-headers-05.txt>

    This document analyzes the security implications of employing IPv6
       fragmentation with Neighbor Discovery (ND) messages.  It updates RFC
       4861 such that use of the IPv6 Fragmentation Header is forbidden in
       all Neighbor Discovery messages, thus allowing for simple and
       effective counter-measures for Neighbor Discovery attacks.  Finally,
       it discusses the security implications of using IPv6 fragmentation
       with SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND), and formally updates RFC 3971
       to provide advice regarding how the aforementioned security
       implications can be prevented.

  "Packet loss resiliency for Router Solicitations", Suresh Krishnan,
  Dmitry Anipko, Dave Thaler, 6-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-6man-resilient-rs-01.txt>

    When an interface on a host is initialized, the host transmits Router
       Solicitations in order to minimize the amount of time it needs to
       wait until the next unsolicited multicast Router Advertisement is
       received.  In certain scenarios, these router solicitations
       transmitted by the host might be lost.  This document specifies a
       mechanism for hosts to cope with the loss of the initial Router
       Solicitations.  Furthermore, on some links, unsolicited multicast
       Router Advertisements are never sent and the mechanism in this
       document is intended to work even in such scenarios.

  "Security Implications of Predictable Fragment Identification Values",
  Fernando Gont, 22-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-6man-predictable-fragment-id-00.txt>

    IPv6 specifies the Fragment Header, which is employed for the
       fragmentation and reassembly mechanisms.  The Fragment Header
       contains an "Identification" field which, together with the IPv6
       Source Address and the IPv6 Destination Address of the packet,
       identifies fragments that correspond to the same original datagram,
       such that they can be reassembled together at the receiving host.
       The only requirement for setting the "Identification" value is that
       it must be different than that of any other fragmented packet sent
       recently with the same Source Address and Destination Address.  Some
       implementations simply use a global counter for setting the Fragment
       Identification field, thus leading to predictable values.  This
       document analyzes the security implications of predictable
       Identification values, and updates RFC 2460 specifying additional
       requirements for setting the Fragment Identification, such that the
       aforementioned security implications are mitigated.

  "Transmission of IPv6 Extension Headers", Brian Carpenter, Sheng Jiang,
  29-May-13, <draft-ietf-6man-ext-transmit-01.txt>

    Various IPv6 extension headers have been standardised since the IPv6
       standard was first published.  This document updates RFC 2460 to
       clarify how intermediate nodes should deal with such extension
       headers and with any that are defined in future.  It also specifies
       how extension headers should be registered by IANA, with a
       corresponding minor update to RFC 2780.

  "Significance of IPv6 Interface Identifiers", Brian Carpenter, Sheng
  Jiang, 24-May-13, <draft-ietf-6man-ug-01.txt>

    The IPv6 addressing architecture includes a unicast interface
       identifier that is used in the creation of many IPv6 addresses.
       Interface identifiers are formed by a variety of methods.  This
       document clarifies that the bits in an interface identifier have no
       generic meaning and that the identifier should be treated as an
       opaque value.  In particular, RFC 4291 defines a method by which the
       Universal and Group bits of an IEEE link-layer address are mapped
       into an IPv6 unicast interface identifier.  This document clarifies
       that those bits apply only to interface identifiers that are derived
       from an IEEE link-layer address.  It updates RFC 4291 accordingly.

  "Updates to the IPv6 Multicast Addressing Architecture", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Stig Venaas, 23-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-6man-multicast-addr-arch-update-01.txt>

    This document updates the IPv6 multicast addressing architecture by
       defining the 17-20 reserved bits as generic flag bits.  The document
       provides also some clarifications related to the use of these flag
       bits.
    
       This document updates RFC 3956, RFC 3306, RFC 4607 and RFC 4291.

IPv6 Site Renumbering (6renum)
------------------------------

  "IPv6 Site Renumbering Gap Analysis", Bing Liu, Sheng Jiang, Brian
  Carpenter, Stig Venaas, Wesley George, 9-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-6renum-gap-analysis-08.txt>

    This document briefly introduces the existing mechanisms that could
       be utilized for IPv6 site renumbering and tries to cover most of the
       explicit issues and requirements of IPv6 renumbering. Its main
       content is a gap analysis that provides a basis for future works to
       identify and develop solutions or to stimulate such development as
       appropriate. The gap analysis is organized by the main steps of a
       renumbering process.

Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond web (abfab)
------------------------------------------------------------

  "A GSS-API Mechanism for the Extensible Authentication Protocol", Sam
  Hartman, Josh Howlett, 13-Aug-12, <draft-ietf-abfab-gss-eap-09.txt>

    This document defines protocols, procedures, and conventions to be
       employed by peers implementing the Generic Security Service
       Application Program Interface (GSS-API) when using the Extensible
       Authentication Protocol mechanism.  Through the GS2 family of
       mechanisms defined in RFC 5801, these protocols also define how
       Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL, RFC 4422)
       applications use the Extensible Authentication Protocol.

  "Name Attributes for the GSS-API EAP mechanism", Sam Hartman, Josh
  Howlett, 14-Nov-12, <draft-ietf-abfab-gss-eap-naming-07.txt>

    The naming extensions to the Generic Security Services Application
       Programming interface provide a mechanism for applications to
       discover authorization and personalization information associated
       with GSS-API names.  The Extensible Authentication Protocol GSS-API
       mechanism allows an Authentication/Authorization/Accounting peer to
       provide authorization attributes along side an authentication
       response.  It also provides mechanisms to process Security Assertion
       Markup Language (SAML) messages provided in the AAA response.  This
       document describes the necessary information to use the naming
       extensions API to access that information.

  "A RADIUS Attribute, Binding, Profiles, Name Identifier Format, and
  Confirmation Methods for SAML", Josh Howlett, Sam Hartman, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-abfab-aaa-saml-05.txt>

    This document specifies a RADIUS attribute, a binding, a name
       identifier format, two profiles, and two confirmation methods for the
       Security Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML).  The attribute provides
       RADIUS encapsulation of SAML protocol messages, and the binding
       describes the use of this attribute, and the SAML protocol messages
       within, with RADIUS transport.  The two profiles describe the
       application of this binding for ABFAB authentication and assertion
       query/request respectively.  The name identifier format allows a
       subject to be named using an NAI, and the subject confirmation
       methods allow queries to be issued for a principal without needing to
       explicitly name the intended subject within the request.  These
       artefacts have been defined to permit application in scenarios other
       than ABFAB, such as network access.

  "Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond web (ABFAB) Use
  Cases", Rhys Smith, 25-Sep-12, <draft-ietf-abfab-usecases-05.txt>

    Federated identity is typically associated with Web-based services at
       present, but there is growing interest in its application in non Web-
       based contexts.  The goal of this document is to document a selection
       of the wide variety of these contexts whose user experience could be
       improved through the use of technologies based on the ABFAB
       architecture and specifications.

  "Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond Web (ABFAB)
  Architecture", Josh Howlett, Sam Hartman, Hannes Tschofenig, Eliot Lear,
  Jim Schaad, 18-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-abfab-arch-06.txt>

    Over the last decade a substantial amount of work has occurred in the
       space of federated access management.  Most of this effort has
       focused on two use cases: network access and web-based access.
       However, the solutions to these use cases that have been proposed and
       deployed tend to have few common building blocks in common.
    
       This memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions to
       the commonly used security mechanisms for both federated and non-
       federated access management, including the Remote Authentication Dial
       In User Service (RADIUS) and the Diameter protocol, the Generic
       Security Service (GSS), the GS2 family, the Extensible Authentication
       Protocol (EAP) and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).
       The architecture addresses the problem of federated access management
       to primarily non-web-based services, in a manner that will scale to
       large numbers of identity providers, relying parties, and
       federations.

  "Update to the EAP Applicability Statement for ABFAB", Stefan Winter,
  Joseph Salowey, 2-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-abfab-eapapplicability-03.txt>

    This document updates the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
       applicability statement from RFC3748 to reflect recent usage of the
       EAP protocol in the Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond
       web (ABFAB) architecture.

Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (alto)
---------------------------------------------

  "ALTO Protocol", Richard Alimi, Reinaldo Penno, Yang Yang, 21-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-alto-protocol-16.txt>

    Applications using the Internet already have access to topology
       information of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks.  For
       example, views to Internet routing tables at looking glass servers
       are available and can be practically downloaded to many application
       clients.  What is missing is knowledge of the underlying network
       topologies from the point of view of ISPs (henceforth referred as
       Providers).  In other words, what a Provider prefers in terms of
       traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute it.
    
       The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service provides
       network information (e.g., basic network location structure and
       preferences of network paths) with the goal of modifying network
       resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving
       application performance.  The basic information of ALTO is based on
       abstract maps of a network.  These maps provide a simplified view,
       yet enough information about a network for applications to
       effectively utilize them.  Additional services are built on top of
       the maps.
    
       This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO Service.
       Although the ALTO Service would primarily be provided by the network
       service providers (e.g., Internet service providers), content service
       providers and third parties could also operate an ALTO service.
       Applications that could use this service are those that have a choice
       to which end points to connect.  Examples of such applications are
       peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.

  "ALTO Deployment Considerations", Martin Stiemerling, Sebastian Kiesel,
  Stefano Previdi, 25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-alto-deployments-06.txt>

    Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as
       pieces of information or server processes, which are available in
       several equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but
       is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal
       of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
       guidance to these applications, which have to select one or several
       hosts from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired
       resource.  The protocol is under specification in the ALTO working
       group.  This memo discusses deployment related issues of ALTO for
       peer-to-peer and CDNs, some preliminary security considerations, and
       also initial guidance for application designers using ALTO.

  "ALTO Server Discovery", Sebastian Kiesel, Martin Stiemerling, Nico
  Schwan, Michael Scharf, Song Yongchao, 21-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-alto-server-discovery-08.txt>

    The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
       provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several
       hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired
       resource.  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an
       ALTO client can ask for guidance it needs to discover one or more
       ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance.
    
       This document specifies a procedure for resource consumer initiated
       ALTO server discovery, which can be used if the ALTO client is
       embedded in the resource consumer.

Access Node Control Protocol (ancp)
-----------------------------------

  "Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) MIB module for Access Nodes",
  Stefaan De Cnodder, Moti Morgenstern, 29-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-ancp-mib-an-10.txt>

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
       for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
       objects for managing access nodes that are using the Access Node
       Control Protocol (ANCP).

  "Multicast Control Extensions for ANCP", Francois Le Faucheur, Roberta
  Maglione, Tom Taylor, 24-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-ancp-mc-extensions-09.txt>

    This document specifies the extensions to the Access Node Control
       Protocol required for support of the multicast use cases defined in
       the Access Node Control Protocol framework document and one
       additional use case described in this document.  These use cases are
       organized into the following ANCP capabilities:
    
       o  NAS-initiated multicast replication;
    
       o  conditional access with white and black lists;
    
       o  conditional access with grey lists;
    
       o  bandwidth delegation;
    
       o  committed bandwidth reporting.
    
       These capabilities may be combined according to the rules given in
       this specification.

Applications Area (app)
-----------------------

  "Prefer Header for HTTP", James Snell, 7-Jan-13,
  <draft-snell-http-prefer-18.txt>

    This specification defines an HTTP header field that can be used by a
       client to request that certain behaviors be employed by a server
       while processing a request.

  "Internet Calendar Scheduling Protocol (iSchedule)", Cyrus Daboo,
  Bernard Desruisseaux, 3-May-13, <draft-desruisseaux-ischedule-05.txt>

    This document defines the Internet Calendar Scheduling Protocol
       (iSchedule), which is a binding from the iCalendar Transport-
       independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) to the Hypertext
       Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to enable interoperability between
       calendaring and scheduling systems over the Internet.

  "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Status Code 308 (Permanent
  Redirect)", Julian Reschke, 26-Mar-12,
  <draft-reschke-http-status-308-07.txt>

    This document specifies the additional HyperText Transfer Protocol
       (HTTP) Status Code 308 (Permanent Redirect).

  "A Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace for IANA Registries", Peter
  Saint-Andre, Michelle Cotton, 13-Feb-13,
  <draft-saintandre-iana-urn-01.txt>

    This document defines a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for
       uniquely identifying information contained in registries maintained
       by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

Applications Area Working Group (appsawg)
-----------------------------------------

  "Advice for Safe Handling of Malformed Messages", Murray Kucherawy,
  Gregory Shapiro, 18-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-appsawg-malformed-mail-06.txt>

    Although Internet mail formats have been precisely defined since the
       1970s, authoring and handling software often show only mild
       conformance to the specifications.  The distributed and non-
       interactive nature of email has often prompted adjustments to
       receiving software, to handle these variations, rather than trying to
       gain better conformance by senders, since the receiving operator is
       primarily driven by complaining recipient users and has no authority
       over the sending side of the system.  Processing with such
       flexibility comes at some cost, since mail software is faced with
       decisions about whether or not to permit non-conforming messages to
       continue toward their destinations unaltered, adjust them to conform
       (possibly at the cost of losing some of the original message), or
       outright rejecting them.
    
       A core requirement for interoperability is that both sides of an
       exchange work from the same details and semantics.  By having
       receivers be flexible, beyond the specifications, there can be -- and
       often has been -- a good chance that a message will not be fully
       interoperable.  Worse, a well-established pattern of tolerance for
       variations can sometimes be used as an attack vector.
    
       This document includes a collection of the best advice available
       regarding a variety of common malformed mail situations, to be used
       as implementation guidance.  It must be emphasized, however, that the
       intent of this document is not to standardize malformations or
       otherwise encourage their proliferation.  The messages are manifestly
       malformed, and the code and culture that generates them needs to be
       fixed.  Therefore, these messages should be rejected outright if at
       all possible.  Nevertheless, many malformed messages from otherwise
       legitimate senders are in circulation and will be for some time, and,
       unfortunately, commercial reality shows that we cannot always simply
       reject or discard them.  Accordingly, this document presents
       alternatives for dealing with them in ways that seem to do the least
       additional harm until the infrastructure is tightened up to match the
       standards.

  "Spam reporting using IMAP: SREP", Zoltan Ordogh, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-ordogh-spam-reporting-using-imap-04.txt>

    This document defines an IMAP extension which allows a client to
       report spam by reference and allows an IMAP server to perform any
       action on the reported messages, including leaving the action at the
       client's discretion.
    
       In addition, this document discusses how an IMAP server can tap into
       spam aggregator services, ultimately allowing the IMAP server to
       improve its decision-making process.
    
    Conventions Used In This Document
    
       In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client or the
       server, respectively.

  "Forwarded HTTP Extension", Andreas Petersson, Martin Nilsson, 9-Oct-12,
  <draft-ietf-appsawg-http-forwarded-10.txt>

    This document defines an HTTP extension header field that allows
       proxy components to disclose information lost in the proxying
       process, for example, the originating IP address of a request or IP
       address of the proxy on the user-agent-facing interface.  In a path
       of proxying components, this makes it possible to arrange it so that
       each subsequent component will have access to, for example, all IP
       addresses used in the chain of proxied HTTP requests.
    
       This document also specifies guidelines for a proxy administrator to
       anonymize the origin of a request.

  "WebFinger", Paul Jones, Gonzalo Salgueiro, Joseph Smarr, 26-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-appsawg-webfinger-14.txt>

    This specification defines the WebFinger protocol, which can be used
       to discover information about people or other entities on the
       Internet using standard HTTP methods.  WebFinger discovers
       information for a URI that might not be usable as a locator
       otherwise, such as account or email URIs.

  "The 'acct' URI Scheme", Peter Saint-Andre, 17-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-appsawg-acct-uri-05.txt>

    This document defines the 'acct' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
       scheme as a way to identify a user's account at a service provider,
       irrespective of the particular protocols that can be used to interact
       with the account.

  "XML Media Types", Chris Lilley, Murata Makoto, Alexey Melnikov, Henry
  Thompson, 28-May-13, <draft-ietf-appsawg-xml-mediatypes-01.txt>

    This specification standardizes three media types -- application/xml,
       application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd --
       for use in exchanging network entities that are related to the
       Extensible Markup Language (XML) while defining text/xml and text/
       xml-external-parsed-entity as aliases for the respective application/
       types.  This specification also standardizes a convention (using the
       suffix '+xml') for naming media types outside of these five types
       when those media types represent XML MIME entities.
    
       Major differences from [RFC3023] are alignment of charset handling
       for text/xml and text/xml-external-parsed-entity with application/
       xml, the addition of XPointer and XML Base as fragment identifiers
       and base URIs, respectively, mention of the XPointer Registry, and
       updating of many references.

  "A Media Type for XML Patch Operations", Erik Wilde, 18-Jun-13,
  <draft-wilde-xml-patch-05.txt>

    The XML Patch media type "application/xml-patch+xml" defines an XML
       document structure for expressing a sequence of patch operations that
       are applied to an XML document.  The XML Patch document format's
       foundations are defined in RFC 5261, this specification defines a
       document format and a media type registration, so that XML Patch
       documents can be labeled with a media type, for example in HTTP
       conversations.
    
       In addition to the media type registration, this specification also
       updates RFC 5261 in some aspects, limiting these updates to cases
       where RFC 5261 needed to be fixed, or was hard to understand.

  "Message Header Field for Indicating Message Authentication Status",
  Murray Kucherawy, 12-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-appsawg-rfc5451bis-07.txt>

    This document specifies a header field for use with electronic mail
       messages to indicate the results of message authentication efforts.
       Any receiver-side software, such as mail filters or Mail User Agents
       (MUAs), can use this header field to relay that information in a
       convenient and meaningful way to users, or make sorting and filtering
       decisions.
    
       This document is a candidate for Internet Standard status.  [RFC
       Editor: Please delete this notation, as I imagine it will be
       indicated some other way.]

  "The application/json-merge-patch Media Type", James Snell, 20-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-appsawg-json-merge-patch-00.txt>

    This specification defines the application/json-merge-patch media
       type and it's intended use with the HTTP PATCH method defined by RFC
       5789.

  "Sieve Email Filtering: Detecting Duplicate Deliveries", Stephan Bosch,
  22-May-13, <draft-ietf-appsawg-sieve-duplicate-00.txt>

    This document defines a new test command "duplicate" for the "Sieve"
       email filtering language.  This test adds the ability to detect
       duplicate message deliveries.  The main application for this new test
       is handling duplicate deliveries commonly caused by mailing list
       subscriptions or redirected mail addresses.  The detection is
       normally performed by matching the message ID to an internal list of
       message IDs from previously delivered messages.  For more complex
       applications, the "duplicate" test can also use the content of a
       specific header or other parts of the message.

  "Securing the RTP Protocol Framework: Why RTP Does Not Mandate a Single
  Media Security Solution", Colin Perkins, Magnus Westerlund, 7-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-avt-srtp-not-mandatory-13.txt>

    This memo discusses the problem of securing real-time multimedia
       sessions, and explains why the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP),
       and the associated RTP control protocol (RTCP), do not mandate a
       single media security mechanism.  Guidelines for designers and
       reviewers of future RTP extensions are provided, to ensure that
       appropriate security mechanisms are mandated, and that any such
       mechanisms are specified in a manner that conforms with the RTP
       architecture.

  "Inter-destination Media Synchronization using the RTP Control Protocol
  (RTCP)", Ray van Brandenburg, Hans Stokking, Oskar van Deventer,
  Fernando Boronat, Mario Montagud, Kevin Gross, 14-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-idms-11.txt>

    This document defines a new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Packet Type
       and an RTCP Extended Report (XR) Block Type to be used for achieving
       Inter-Destination Media Synchronization (IDMS).  IDMS is the process
       of synchronizing playout across multiple geographically distributed
       media receivers.  Using the RTCP XR IDMS Report Block defined in this
       document, media playout information from participants in a
       synchronization group can be collected.  Based on the collected
       information, an RTCP IDMS Settings Packet can then be sent to
       distribute a common target playout point to which all the distributed
       receivers, sharing a media experience, can synchronize.
    
       Typical use cases in which IDMS is useful are social TV, shared
       service control (i.e. applications where two or more geographically
       separated users are watching a media stream together), distance
       learning, networked video walls, networked loudspeakers, etc.

  "AES-GCM and AES-CCM Authenticated Encryption in Secure RTP (SRTP)",
  David McGrew, Kevin Igoe, 20-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-srtp-aes-gcm-06.txt>

    This document defines how AES-GCM and AES-CCM Authenticated
       Encryption with Associated Data algorithms can be used to provide
       confidentiality and data authentication in the SRTP protocol.

  "The ARIA Algorithm and Its Use with the Secure Real-time Transport
  Protocol(SRTP)", Woo-Hwan Kim, Jungkeun Lee, Dong-Chan Kim, Je-Hong
  Park, Daesung Kwon, 5-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-avtcore-aria-srtp-02.txt,.pdf>

    This document describes the use of the ARIA block cipher algorithm
       within the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for providing
       confidentiality for the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) traffic
       and for the control traffic for RTP, the Real-time Transport Control
       Protocol (RTCP).  It details three modes of operation (CTR, CCM, GCM)
       and a SRTP Key Derivation Function for ARIA.

  "RTP and Leap Seconds", Kevin Gross, Ray van Brandenburg, 19-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-leap-second-02.txt>

    This document discusses issues that arise when RTP sessions span
       Universal Coordinate Time (UTC) leap seconds.  It updates RFC 3550 to
       describe how RTP senders and receivers should behave in the presence
       of leap seconds.

  "RTP Clock Source Signalling", Aidan Williams, Kevin Gross, Ray van
  Brandenburg, Hans Stokking, 8-May-13, <draft-ietf-avtcore-clksrc-04.txt>

    NTP format timestamps are used by several RTP protocols for
       synchronisation and statistical measurements.  This memo specifies
       SDP signalling identifying timestamp reference clock sources and SDP
       signalling identifying the media clock sources in a multimedia
       session.

  "Options for Securing RTP Sessions", Magnus Westerlund, Colin Perkins,
  6-May-13, <draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-security-options-03.txt>

    The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in a large number of
       different application domains and environments.  This heterogeneity
       implies that different security mechanisms are needed to provide
       services such as confidentiality, integrity and source authentication
       of RTP/RTCP packets suitable for the various environments.  The range
       of solutions makes it difficult for RTP-based application developers
       to pick the most suitable mechanism.  This document provides an
       overview of a number of security solutions for RTP, and gives
       guidance for developers on how to choose the appropriate security
       mechanism.

  "Multiple Media Types in an RTP Session", Magnus Westerlund, Colin
  Perkins, Jonathan Lennox, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-multi-media-rtp-session-02.txt>

    This document specifies how an RTP session can contain media streams
       with media from multiple media types such as audio, video, and text.
       This has been restricted by the RTP Specification, and thus this
       document updates RFC 3550 and RFC 3551 to enable this behaviour for
       applications that satisfy the applicability for using multiple media
       types in a single RTP session.

  "Multimedia Congestion Control: Circuit Breakers for Unicast RTP
  Sessions", Colin Perkins, Varun Singh, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers-02.txt>

    The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony,
       video conferencing, and telepresence applications.  Such applications
       are often run on best-effort UDP/IP networks.  If congestion control
       is not implemented in the applications, then network congestion will
       deteriorate the user's multimedia experience.  This document does not
       propose a congestion control algorithm; instead, it defines a minimal
       set of RTP "circuit-breakers".  Circuit-breakers are conditions under
       which an RTP sender needs to stop transmitting media data in order to
       protect the network from excessive congestion.  It is expected that,
       in the absence of severe congestion, all RTP applications running on
       best-effort IP networks will be able to run without triggering these
       circuit breakers.  Any future RTP congestion control specification
       will be expected to operate within the constraints defined by these
       circuit breakers.

  "Guidelines for Choosing RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Names
  (CNAMEs)", Ali Begen, Colin Perkins, Dan Wing, Eric Rescorla, 19-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-6222bis-04.txt>

    The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Name (CNAME) is a
       persistent transport-level identifier for an RTP endpoint.  While the
       Synchronization Source (SSRC) identifier of an RTP endpoint may
       change if a collision is detected or when the RTP application is
       restarted, its RTCP CNAME is meant to stay unchanged, so that RTP
       endpoints can be uniquely identified and associated with their RTP
       media streams.
    
       For proper functionality, RTCP CNAMEs should be unique within the
       participants of an RTP session.  However, the existing guidelines for
       choosing the RTCP CNAME provided in the RTP standard are insufficient
       to achieve this uniqueness.  RFC 6222 was published to update those
       guidelines to allow endpoints to choose unique RTCP CNAMEs.
       Unfortunately, later investigations showed that some parts of the new
       algorithms were unnecessarily complicated and/or ineffective.  This
       document addresses these concerns and replaces RFC 6222.

  "Update to Recommended Codecs for the RTP Profile for Audio and Video
  Conferences with Minimal Control (RTP/AVP)", Timothy Terriberry,
  10-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-avtcore-avp-codecs-02.txt>

    The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control
       (RTP/AVP) is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure
       Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for
       Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/
       AVPF), and the Extended Secure RTP Profile for RTCP-Based Feedback
       (RTP/SAVPF).  This document updates the RTP/AVP profile (and by
       extension, the profiles that build upon it) to reflect changes in
       audio codec usage since the document was originally published.

  "Guidelines for using the Multiplexing Features of RTP", Magnus
  Westerlund, BoB, Colin Perkins, Harald Alvestrand, 22-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-multiplex-guidelines-00.txt>

    Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a flexible protocol possible to
       use in a wide range of applications and network and system
       topologies.  This flexibility and the implications of different
       choices should be understood by any application developer using RTP.
       To facilitate that understanding, this document contains an in-depth
       discussion of the usage of RTP's multiplexing points; the RTP session
       and the Synchronisation Source Identifier (SSRC).  The document tries
       to give guidance and source material for an analysis on the most
       suitable choices for the application being designed.

  "RTP Considerations for Endpoints Sending Multiple Media Streams",
  Jonathan Lennox, Magnus Westerlund, Wenson Wu, Colin Perkins, 22-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-00.txt>

    This document expands and clarifies the behavior of the Real-Time
       Transport Protocol (RTP) endpoints when they are sending multiple
       media streams in a single RTP session.  In particular, issues
       involving Real-Time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) messages are
       described.
    
       This document updates RFC 3550 in regards to handling of multiple
       SSRCs per endpoint in RTP sessions.

  "RTP Topologies", Magnus Westerlund, Stephan Wenger, 22-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-topologies-update-00.txt>

    This document discusses point to point and multi-endpoint topologies
       used in Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)-based environments.  In
       particular, centralized topologies commonly employed in the video
       conferencing industry are mapped to the RTP terminology.
    
       This document is updated with additional topologies and are intended
       to replace RFC 5117.

Audio/Video Transport Extensions (avtext)
-----------------------------------------

  "Support for Multiple Clock Rates in an RTP Session", Marc
  Petit-Huguenin, Glen Zorn, 21-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-avtext-multiple-clock-rates-09.txt>

    This document clarifies the RTP specification when different clock
       rates are used in an RTP session.  It also provides guidance on how
       to interoperate with legacy RTP implementations that use multiple
       clock rates.

  "Duplicating RTP Streams", Ali Begen, Colin Perkins, 21-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-avtext-rtp-duplication-02.txt>

    Packet loss is undesirable for real-time multimedia sessions, but can
       occur due to congestion, or other unplanned network outages.  This is
       especially true for IP multicast networks, where packet loss patterns
       can vary greatly between receivers.  One technique that can be used
       to recover from packet loss without incurring unbounded delay for all
       the receivers is to duplicate the packets and send them in separate
       redundant streams.  This document explains how Real-time Transport
       Protocol (RTP) streams can be duplicated without breaking RTP or RTP
       Control Protocol (RTCP) rules.

Behavior Engineering for Hindrance Avoidance (behave)
-----------------------------------------------------

  "Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Network Address
  Translation", Randall Stewart, Michael Tuexen, Irene Ruengeler,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-behave-sctpnat-08.txt>

    Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable
       communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to
       TCP [RFC0793].  With the widespread deployment of Network Address
       Translators (NAT), specialized code has been added to NAT for TCP
       that allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT and yet use only a
       single globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts (behind a
       NAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection.  This
       additional code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port
       Translation or NAPT.  To date, specialized code for SCTP has NOT yet
       been added to most NATs so that only pure NAT is available.  The end
       result of this is that only one SCTP capable host can be behind a
       NAT.
    
       This document describes an SCTP specific variant of NAT which
       provides similar features of NAPT in the single point and multi-point
       traversal scenario.

  "Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis", Teemu
  Savolainen, Jouni Korhonen, Dan Wing, 4-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-behave-nat64-discovery-heuristic-17.txt>

    This document describes a method for detecting the presence of DNS64
       and for learning the IPv6 prefix used for protocol translation on an
       access network.  The method depends on the existence of a well-known
       IPv4-only fully qualified domain name "ipv4only.arpa".  The
       information learned enables nodes to perform local IPv6 address
       synthesis and to potentially avoid NAT64 on dual-stack and multi-
       interface deployments.

  "Analysis of solution proposals for hosts to learn NAT64 prefix", Jouni
  Korhonen, Teemu Savolainen, 8-Mar-12,
  <draft-ietf-behave-nat64-learn-analysis-03.txt>

    Hosts and applications may benefit from the knowledge if an IPv6
       address is synthesized, which would mean a NAT64 is used to reach the
       IPv4 network or Internet.  This document analyses a number of
       proposed solutions for communicating whether the synthesis is taking
       place, used address format, and the IPv6 prefix used by the NAT64 and
       DNS64.  The solutions enable both NAT64 avoidance and intentional
       utilization by allowing local IPv6 address synthesis.  The document
       concludes by recommending selection of heuristic discovery based
       solution.

  "Additional Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)",
  Simon Perreault, Tina Tsou, Senthil Sivakumar, 1-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-behave-nat-mib-06.txt>

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
       for devices implementing Network Address Translator (NAT) function.
       This MIB module may be used for monitoring of a device capable of NAT
       function.

  "Syslog Format for NAT Logging", Zhonghua Chen, Cathy Zhou, Tina Tsou,
  Tom Taylor, 8-May-13, <draft-ietf-behave-syslog-nat-logging-01.txt>

    With the wide deployment of Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) devices, the
       logging of NAT-related events has become very important for legal
       purposes.  The logs may be required to identify a host that was used
       to launch malicious attacks or engage in illegal behaviour, and/or
       may be required for accounting purposes.  This document identifies
       the events that need to be logged and the parameters that are
       required in the logs depending on the context in which the NAT is
       being used.  It goes on to standardize formats for reporting these
       events and parameters using SYSLOG (RFC 5424).  A companion document
       specifies formats for reporting the same events and parameters using
       IPFIX (RFC 5101).  Applicability statements are provided in this
       document and its companion to guide operators and implementors in
       their choice of which technology to use for logging.

  "IPFIX Information Elements for logging NAT Events", Senthil Sivakumar,
  Reinaldo Penno, 19-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-behave-ipfix-nat-logging-00.txt>

    NAT devices are required to log events like creation and deletion of
       translations and information about the resources it is managing.
       With the wide deployment of Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) devices, the
       logging of events have become very important for legal purposes.  The
       logs are required in many cases to identify an attacker or a host
       that was used to launch malicious attacks and/or for various other
       purposes of accounting.  Since there is no standard way of logging
       this information, different NAT devices behave differently and hence
       it is difficult to expect a consistent behavior.  The lack of a
       consistent way makes it difficult to write the collector applications
       that would receive this data and process it to present useful
       information.  This document describes the information that is
       required to be logged by the NAT devices.

  "Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements Updates",
  Reinaldo Penno, Simon Perreault, Mohamed Boucadair, Kengo Naito,
  3-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-behave-requirements-update-00.txt>

    This document clarifies and updates several requirements of RFC4787,
       RFC5382 and RFC5508 based on operational and development experience.
       The focus of this document is NAPT44.

Binary Floor Control Protocol Bis  (bfcpbis)
--------------------------------------------

  "The Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP)", Gonzalo Camarillo, Keith
  Drage, Tom Kristensen, Joerg Ott, Charles Eckel, 26-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis-09.txt>

    Floor control is a means to manage joint or exclusive access to
       shared resources in a (multiparty) conferencing environment.
       Thereby, floor control complements other functions -- such as
       conference and media session setup, conference policy manipulation,
       and media control -- that are realized by other protocols.
    
       This document specifies the Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP).
       BFCP is used between floor participants and floor control servers,
       and between floor chairs (i.e., moderators) and floor control
       servers.
    
       This document obsoletes RFC 4582.  Changes from RFC 4582 are
       summarized in Section 16.

  "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Format for Binary Floor Control
  Protocol (BFCP) Streams", Gonzalo Camarillo, Tom Kristensen, 26-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4583bis-07.txt>

    This document specifies how to describe Binary Floor Control Protocol
       (BFCP) streams in Session Description Protocol (SDP) descriptions.
       User agents using the offer/answer model to establish BFCP streams
       use this format in their offers and answers.
    
       This document obsoletes RFC 4583.  Changes from RFC 4583 are
       summarized in Section 12.

Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (bfd)
----------------------------------------

  "BFD Management Information Base", Thomas Nadeau, Zafar Ali, Nobo Akiya,
  17-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-bfd-mib-13.txt,.pdf>

    This draft defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
       for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
       In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling
       Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol.

  "Definitions of Textual Conventions (TCs) for Bidirectional Forwarding
  Detection (BFD) Management", Thomas Nadeau, Zafar Ali, Nobo Akiya,
  19-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-bfd-tc-mib-02.txt,.pdf>

    This draft defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module which
       contains Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Bidirectional
       Forwarding Detection (BFD) management information.  The intent is
       that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in BFD
       related MIB modules that would otherwise define their own
       representations.

  "BFD Generic Cryptographic Authentication", Manav Bhatia, Vishwas
  Manral, Dacheng Zhang, 18-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-bfd-generic-crypto-auth-04.txt>

    This document proposes an extension to Bidirectional Forwarding
       Detection (BFD) to allow the use of arbitary cryptographic
       authentication algorithms in addition to the already-documented
       authentication schemes described in the base specification.  This
       document adds the basic infrastructure that is required for
       supporting algorithm and key agility for BFD.

  "BFD for Multipoint Networks", Dave Katz, David Ward, 17-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-bfd-multipoint-02.txt>

    This document describes extensions to the Bidirectional Forwarding
       Detection (BFD) protocol for its use in multipoint and multicast
       networks.  Comments on this draft should be directed to
       rtg-bfd@ietf.org.

  "Authenticating BFD using HMAC-SHA-2 procedures", Dacheng Zhang, Manav
  Bhatia, Vishwas Manral, 18-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-bfd-hmac-sha-03.txt>

    This document describes the mechanism to authenticate Bidirectional
       Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol packets using Hashed Message
       Authentication Mode (HMAC) with the SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512
       algorithms.  The described mechanism uses the Generic Cryptographic
       Authentication and Generic Meticulous Cryptographic Authentication
       sections to carry the authentication data.  This document updates,
       but does not supercede, the cryptographic authentication mechanism
       specified in RFC 5880.

  "BFD Management Information Base (MIB) extensions for MPLS and MPLS-TP
  Networks", Sam Aldrin, Venkatesan Mahalingam, Kannan Sampath, Thomas
  Nadeau, 26-Dec-12, <draft-ietf-bfd-mpls-mib-01.txt>

    This draft defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
       for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
       In particular, it extends the BFD Management Information Base BFD-
       STD-MIB and describes the managed objects for modeling Bidirectional
       Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol for MPLS and MPLS-TP networks.

  "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) on Link Aggregation Group
  (LAG) Interfaces", Manav Bhatia, Mach Chen, Sami Boutros, Marc
  Binderberger, Jeffrey Haas, 13-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-bfd-on-lags-01.txt>

    This document proposes a mechanism to run BFD on Link Aggregation
       Group (LAG) interfaces.  It does so by running an independent
       Asynchronous mode BFD session on every LAG member link.
    
       This mechanism allows the verification of member link continuity,
       either in combination with, or in absence of, LACP.  It provides a
       shorter detection time than what LACP offers.  The continuity check
       can also cover elements of layer 3 bidirectional forwarding.
    
       This mechanism utilizes a well-known UDP port distinct from that of
       single-hop BFD over IP.  This new UDP port removes the ambiguity of
       BFD over LAG packets from BFD over single-hop IP.

Basic Level of Interoperability for SIP Services (bliss)
--------------------------------------------------------

  "Shared Appearances of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Address of
  Record (AOR)", Alan Johnston, Mohsen Soroushnejad, Venkatesh
  Venkataramanan, 16-Jan-13, <draft-ietf-bliss-shared-appearances-15.txt>

    This document describes the requirements and implementation of a
       group telephony feature commonly known as Bridged Line Appearance
       (BLA) or Multiple Line Appearance (MLA), or Shared Call/Line
       Appearance (SCA).  When implemented using the Session Initiation
       Protocol (SIP), it is referred to as shared appearances of an Address
       of Record (AOR) since SIP does not have the concept of lines.  This
       feature is commonly offered in IP Centrex services and IP-PBX
       offerings and is likely to be implemented on SIP IP telephones and
       SIP feature servers used in a business environment.  This feature
       allows several user agents (UAs) to share a common AOR, learn about
       calls placed and received by other UAs in the group, and pick up or
       join calls within the group.  This document discusses use cases,
       lists requirements and defines extensions to implement this feature.
       This specification updates RFC3261 and RFC4235.

Benchmarking Methodology (bmwg)
-------------------------------

  "Methodology for Benchmarking SIP Networking Devices", Carol Davids,
  Vijay Gurbani, Scott Poretsky, 8-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-bmwg-sip-bench-meth-08.txt>

    This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Session
       Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance as described in SIP
       benchmarking terminology document.  The methodology and terminology
       are to be used for benchmarking signaling plane performance with
       varying signaling and media load.  Both scale and establishment rate
       are measured by signaling plane performance.  The SIP Devices to be
       benchmarked may be a single device under test (DUT) or a system under
       test (SUT).  Benchmarks can be obtained and compared for different
       types of devices such as SIP Proxy Server, SBC, and server paired
       with a media relay or Firewall/NAT device.

  "Terminology for Benchmarking Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
  Networking Devices", Carol Davids, Vijay Gurbani, Scott Poretsky,
  8-Jan-13, <draft-ietf-bmwg-sip-bench-term-08.txt>

    This document provides a terminology for benchmarking the SIP
       performance of networking devices.  The term performance in this
       context means the capacity of the device- or system-under-test to
       process SIP messages.  Terms are included for test components, test
       setup parameters, and performance benchmark metrics for black-box
       benchmarking of SIP networking devices.  The performance benchmark
       metrics are obtained for the SIP signaling plane only.  The terms are
       intended for use in a companion methodology document for
       characterizing the performance of a SIP networking device under a
       variety of conditions.  The intent of the two documents is to enable
       a comparison of the capacity of SIP networking devices.  Test setup
       parameters and a methodology document are necessary because SIP
       allows a wide range of configuration and operational conditions that
       can influence performance benchmark measurements.  A standard
       terminology and methodology will ensure that benchmarks have
       consistent definition and were obtained following the same
       procedures.

  "Benchmarking Methodology for Content-Aware Network Devices", Mike
  Hamilton, Sarah Banks, 6-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-bmwg-ca-bench-meth-04.txt>

    This document defines a set of test scenarios and metrics that can be
       used to benchmark content-aware network devices.  The scenarios in
       the following document are intended to more accurately predict the
       performance of these devices when subjected to dynamic traffic
       patterns.  This document will operate within the constraints of the
       Benchmarking Working Group charter, namely black box characterization
       in a laboratory environment.

  "IMIX Genome: Specification of variable packet sizes for additional
  testing", Al Morton, 3-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-bmwg-imix-genome-05.txt>

    Benchmarking Methodologies have always relied on test conditions with
       constant packet sizes, with the goal of understanding what network
       device capability has been tested.  Tests with constant packet size
       reveal device capabilities but differ significantly from the
       conditions encountered in operational deployment, and so additional
       tests are sometimes conducted with a mixture of packet sizes, or
       "IMIX".  The mixture of sizes a networking device will encounter is
       highly variable and depends on many factors.  An IMIX suited for one
       networking device and deployment will not be appropriate for another.
       However, the mix of sizes may be known and the tester may be asked to
       augment the fixed size tests.  To address this need, and the
       perpetual goal of specifying repeatable test conditions, this draft
       defines a way to specify the exact repeating sequence of packet sizes
       from the usual set of fixed sizes, and other forms of mixed size
       specification.

  "Routing and Wavelength Assignment Information Model for Wavelength
  Switched Optical Networks", Young Lee, Greg Bernstein, Dan Li, Wataru
  Imajuku, 13-May-13, <draft-ietf-ccamp-rwa-info-18.txt>

    This document provides a model of information needed by the routing
       and wavelength assignment (RWA) process in wavelength switched
       optical networks (WSONs).  The purpose of the information described
       in this model is to facilitate constrained lightpath computation in
       WSONs. This model takes into account compatibility constraints
       between WSON signal attributes and network elements but does not
       include constraints due to optical impairments. Aspects of this
       information that may be of use to other technologies utilizing a
       GMPLS control plane are discussed.

  "Routing and Wavelength Assignment Information Encoding for Wavelength
  Switched Optical Networks", Greg Bernstein, Young Lee, Dan Li, Wataru
  Imajuku, 15-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-ccamp-rwa-wson-encode-20.txt>

    A wavelength switched optical network (WSON) requires that certain
       key information elements are made available to facilitate path
       computation and the establishment of label switching paths (LSPs).
       The information model described in "Routing and Wavelength
       Assignment Information for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks"
       shows what information is required at specific points in the WSON.
       Part of the WSON information model contains aspects that may be of
       general applicability to other technologies, while other parts are
       fairly specific to WSONs.
    
       This document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for
       the WSON specific information elements. It is intended that
       protocol-specific documents will reference this memo to describe how
       information is carried for specific uses. Such encodings can be used
       to extend GMPLS signaling and routing protocols. In addition these
       encodings could be used by other mechanisms to convey this same
       information to a path computation element (PCE).

  "GMPLS RSVP-TE extensions for OAM Configuration", Attila Takacs, Don
  Fedyk, He Jia, 15-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-oam-configuration-fwk-10.txt>

    OAM is an integral part of transport connections, hence it is
       required that OAM functions are activated/deactivated in sync with
       connection commissioning/decommissioning; avoiding spurious alarms
       and ensuring consistent operation.  In certain technologies, OAM
       entities are inherently established once the connection is set up,
       while other technologies require extra configuration to establish and
       configure OAM entities.  This document specifies extensions to
       RSVP-TE to support the establishment and configuration of OAM
       entities along with LSP signaling.

  "GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for Ethernet OAM Configuration", Attila
  Takacs, Balazs Gero, Hao Long, 15-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-eth-oam-ext-10.txt>

    The GMPLS controlled Ethernet Label Switching (GELS) work extended
       GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the establishment of Ethernet LSPs.  IEEE
       Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) specifies an adjunct OAM
       flow to check connectivity in Ethernet networks.  CFM can be also
       used with Ethernet LSPs for fault detection and triggering recovery
       mechanisms.  The ITU-T Y.1731 specification builds on CFM and
       specifies additional OAM mechanisms, including Performance
       Monitoring, for Ethernet networks.  This document specifies
       extensions of GMPLS RSVP-TE protocol to support the setup of the
       associated Ethernet OAM entities of Ethernet LSPs, and defines the
       Ethernet technology specific TLVs based on [OAM-CONF-FWK].  This
       document supports, but does not modify, the IEEE and ITU-T OAM
       mechanisms.

  "GMPLS OSPF Enhancement for Signal and Network Element Compatibility for
  Wavelength Switched Optical Networks", Young Lee, Greg Bernstein,
  6-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-ccamp-wson-signal-compatibility-ospf-11.txt>

    This document provides GMPLS OSPF routing enhancements to support
       signal compatibility constraints associated with WSON network
       elements. These routing enhancements are required in common optical
       or hybrid electro-optical networks where not all of the optical
       signals in the network are compatible with all network elements
       participating in the network.
    
       This compatibility constraint model is applicable to common optical
       or hybrid electro optical systems such as OEO switches,
       regenerators, and wavelength converters since such systems can be
       limited to processing only certain types of WSON signals.

  "General Network Element Constraint Encoding for GMPLS Controlled
  Networks", Greg Bernstein, Young Lee, Dan Li, Wataru Imajuku, 6-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode-11.txt>

    Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching can be used to control a
       wide variety of technologies. In some of these technologies network
       elements and links may impose additional routing constraints such as
       asymmetric switch connectivity, non-local label assignment, and
       label range limitations on links.
    
       This document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for
       general information elements representing connectivity and label
       constraints as well as label availability. It is intended that
       protocol-specific documents will reference this memo to describe how
       information is carried for specific uses.

  "Configuration of Pro-Active Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
  (OAM) Functions for MPLS-based Transport Networks using RSVP-TE", Elisa
  Bellagamba, Loa Andersson, Pontus Skoldstrom, David Ward, Attila Takacs,
  20-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-mpls-tp-oam-ext-12.txt>

    This specification describes the configuration of pro-active MPLS-TP
       (MPLS-Transport Profile) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
       (OAM) Functions for a given LSP using a set of TLVs that are carried
       by the GMPLS RSVP-TE protocol based on [OAM-CONF-FWK].
    
       This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
       (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
       Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
       Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
       capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

  "Framework for GMPLS and PCE Control of G.709 Optical Transport
  Networks", Fatai Zhang, Dan Li, Han Li, Sergio Belotti, Daniele
  Ceccarelli, 18-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-g709-framework-13.txt>

    This document provides a framework to allow the development of
       protocol extensions to support Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
       Switching (GMPLS) and Path Computation Element (PCE) control of
       Optical Transport Networks (OTN) as specified in ITU-T Recommendation
       G.709 as published in 2012.

  "Signaling Extensions for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks", Greg
  Bernstein, Sugang Xu, Young Lee, Giovanni Martinelli, Hiroaki Harai,
  18-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-ccamp-wson-signaling-05.txt>

    This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
       Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched
       optical networks (WSON).  Such extensions are necessary in WSONs
       under a number of conditions including: (a) when optional
       processing, such as regeneration, must be configured to occur at
       specific nodes along a path, (b) where equipment must be configured
       to accept an optical signal with specific attributes, or (c) where
       equipment must be configured to output an optical signal with
       specific attributes. In addition this memo provides mechanisms to
       support distributed wavelength assignment with bidirectional LSPs,
       and choice in distributed wavelength assignment algorithms. These
       extensions build on previous work for the control of lambda and
       G.709 based networks.

  "RSVP-TE Extensions for Associated Bidirectional LSPs", Fei Zhang,
  Ruiquan Jing, Rakesh Gandhi, 18-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-rsvpte-ext-associated-lsp-06.txt>

    The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) requirements document [RFC5654],
       describes that MPLS-TP MUST support associated bidirectional point-
       to-point LSPs.
    
       This document provides a method to bind two unidirectional Label
       Switched Paths (LSPs) into an associated bidirectional LSP.  The
       association is achieved by defining the new Association Types in the
       Extended ASSOCIATION object.

  "Revised Definition of The GMPLS Switching Capability and Type Fields",
  Lou Berger, Julien Meuric, 17-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-swcaps-update-01.txt>

    GMPLS provides control for multiple switching technologies, and
       hierarchical switching within a technology.  GMPLS routing and
       signaling use common values to indicate switching technology type.
       These values are carried in routing in the Switching Capability
       field, and in signaling in the Switching Type field. While the
       values used in these fields are the primary indicators of the
       technology and hierarchy level being controlled, the values are
       not consistently defined and used across the different
       technologies supported by GMPLS.  This document is intended to
       resolve the inconsistent definition and use of the Switching
       Capability and Type fields by narrowly scoping the meaning and use
       of the fields.  This document updates any document that uses the
       GMPLS Switching Capability and Types fields, in particular RFC
       3471, RFC 4202, RFC 4203, and RFC 5307.

  "LSP Attribute in ERO", Cyril Margaria, Giovanni Martinelli, Steve

  <draft-ietf-ccamp-lsp-diversity-01.txt>

    RFC 4874 specifies methods by which route exclusions may be
       communicated during RSVP-TE signaling in networks where precise
       explicit paths are not computed by the LSP source node. This
       document specifies signaling for additional route exclusions based
       on Paths currently existing or expected to exist within the network.

  "Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) extension

  Swallow, Clarence Filsfils, Matt Hartley, Kenji Kumaki, Ruediger Kunze,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-ccamp-te-metric-recording-01.txt>

    There are many scenarios in which Traffic Engineering (TE) metrics
         such as cost, latency and latency variation associated with a
         Forwarding Adjacency (FA) or Routing Adjacency (RA) Label Switched

Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (cdni)
------------------------------------------------

  "Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) Requirements", Kent
  Leung, Yiu Lee, 31-May-13, <draft-ietf-cdni-requirements-07.txt>

    Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are frequently used for content
       delivery.  As a result of significant growth in content delivered
       over IP networks, existing CDN providers are scaling up their
       infrastructure.  Many Network Service Providers and Enterprise
       Service Providers are also deploying their own CDNs.  To deliver
       contents from the Content Service Protect (CSP) to end users, the
       contents may traverse across multiple CDNs.  This creates a need for
       interconnecting (previously) standalone CDNs so that they can
       collectively act as a single delivery platform from the CSP to the
       end users.
    
       The goal of the present document is to outline the requirements for
       the solution and interfaces to be specified by the CDNI working
       group.

  "Framework for CDN Interconnection", Larry Peterson, Bruce Davie,
  18-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-cdni-framework-03.txt,.pdf>

    This document presents a framework for Content Distribution Network
       Interconnection (CDNI).  The purpose of the framework is to provide
       an overall picture of the problem space of CDNI and to describe the
       relationships among the various components necessary to interconnect
       CDNs.  CDN Interconnection requires the specification of several
       interfaces and mechanisms to address issues such as request routing,
       distribution metadata exchange, and logging information exchange
       across CDNs.  The intent of this document is to outline what each
       interface needs to accomplish, and to describe how these interfaces
       and mechanisms fit together, while leaving their detailed
       specification to other documents.  It obsoletes RFC 3466.

  "CDN Interconnect Metadata", Ben Niven-Jenkins, Rob Murray, Grant
  Watson, Matt Caulfield, Kent Leung, Kevin Ma, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-cdni-metadata-01.txt>

    The CDNI Metadata Interface enables interconnected CDNs to exchange
       content distribution metadata in order to enable content acquisition
       and delivery.  The CDNI metadata associated with a piece of content
       provides a downstream CDN with sufficient information for the
       downstream CDN to service content requests on behalf of an upstream
       CDN.  This document describes both the core set of CDNI metadata and
       the protocol for exchanging that metadata.

  "CDNI Logging Interface", Gilles Bertrand, Iuniana Oprescu, Francois Le
  Faucheur, Roy Peterkofsky, 31-May-13, <draft-ietf-cdni-logging-03.txt>

    This memo specifies the Logging interface between a downstream CDN
       (dCDN) and an upstream CDN (uCDN) that are interconnected as per the
       CDN Interconnection (CDNI) framework.  First, it describes a
       reference model for CDNI logging.  Then, it specifies the CDNI
       Logging File format and the actual protocol for exchange of CDNI
       Logging Files.

  "CDNI Control Interface / Triggers", Rob Murray, Ben Niven-Jenkins,
  8-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-cdni-control-triggers-00.txt>

    This document describes the part of the CDN Interconnect Control
       Interface that allows a CDN to trigger activity in an interconnected
       CDN that is configured to deliver content on its behalf.  The
       upstream CDN can use this mechanism to request that the downstream
       CDN pre-positions metadata or content, or that it re-validate or
       purge metadata or content.  The upstream CDN can monitor the status
       of activity that it has triggered in the downstream CDN.

  "Request Routing Redirection Interface for CDN Interconnection", Wang
  Danhua, Ben Niven-Jenkins, Xiaoyan He, Ge Chen, Wei Ni, 15-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-cdni-redirection-00.txt>

    The Request Routing Interface comprises of (1) the asynchronous
       advertisement of footprint and capabilities by a downstream CDN that
       allows a upstream CDN to decide whether to redirect particular user
       requests to that downstream CDN; and (2) the synchronous operation of
       an upstream CDN requesting whether a downstream CDN is prepared to
       accept a user request and of a downstream CDN responding with how to
       actually redirect the user request.  This document describes an
       interface for the latter part, i.e.  the CDNI request routing/
       Redirection Interface.

ControLling mUltiple streams for tElepresence (clue)

  "Use Cases for Telepresence Multi-streams", Allyn Romanow, Stephen
  Botzko, Mark Duckworth, Roni Even, 6-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-clue-telepresence-use-cases-05.txt>

    Telepresence conferencing systems seek to create the sense of really
       being present for the participants.  A number of techniques for
       handling audio and video streams are used to create this experience.
       When these techniques are not similar, interoperability between
       different systems is difficult at best, and often not possible.
       Conveying information about the relationships between multiple
       streams of media would allow senders and receivers to make choices to
       allow telepresence systems to interwork.  This memo describes the
       most typical and important use cases for sending multiple streams in
       a telepresence conference.

  "Requirements for Telepresence Multi-Streams", Allyn Romanow, Stephen
  Botzko, 15-Jan-13, <draft-ietf-clue-telepresence-requirements-03.txt>

    This memo discusses the requirements for a specification that enables
       telepresence interoperability, by describing the relationship between
       multiple RTP streams.  In addition, the problem statement and
       definitions are also covered herein.

  "Framework for Telepresence Multi-Streams", Mark Duckworth, Andrew
  Pepperell, Stephan Wenger, 16-May-13, <draft-ietf-clue-framework-10.txt>

    This document offers a framework for a protocol that enables
       devices in a telepresence conference to interoperate by specifying
       the relationships between multiple media streams.

  "Mapping RTP streams to CLUE media captures", Roni Even, Jonathan
  Lennox, 17-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-clue-rtp-mapping-00.txt>

    This document describes mechanisms and recommended practice for

    This document describes and examines listening test results obtained
       for the Opus codec and how they relate to the requirements.

  "Ogg Encapsulation for the Opus Audio Codec", Timothy Terriberry, Ron
  Lee, Ralph Giles, 24-May-13, <draft-ietf-codec-oggopus-01.txt>

    This document defines the Ogg encapsulation for the Opus interactive
       speech and audio codec.  This allows data encoded in the Opus format
       to be stored in an Ogg logical bitstream.  Ogg encapsulation provides
       Opus with a long-term storage format supporting all of the essential
       features, including metadata, fast and accurate seeking, corruption
       detection, recapture after errors, low overhead, and the ability to
       multiplex Opus with other codecs (including video) with minimal
       buffering.  It also provides a live streamable format, capable of
       delivery over a reliable stream-oriented transport, without requiring
       all the data, or even the total length of the data, up-front, in a
       form that is identical to the on-disk storage format.

Congestion Exposure (conex)
---------------------------

  "IPv6 Destination Option for ConEx", Suresh Krishnan, Mirja Kuehlewind,
  Carlos Ucendo, 28-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-conex-destopt-04.txt>

    ConEx is a mechanism by which senders inform the network about the
       congestion encountered by packets earlier in the same flow.  This
       document specifies an IPv6 destination option that is capable of
       carrying ConEx markings in IPv6 datagrams.

  "TCP modifications for Congestion Exposure", Mirja Kuehlewind, Richard
  Scheffenegger, 30-May-13, <draft-ietf-conex-tcp-modifications-03.txt>

    Congestion Exposure (ConEx) is a mechanism by which senders inform
       the network about the congestion encountered by previous packets on
       the same flow.  This document describes the necessary modifications
       to use ConEx with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

  "Mobile Communication Congestion Exposure Scenario", Dirk Kutscher,
  Faisal Mir, Rolf Winter, Suresh Krishnan, Ying Zhang, Carlos Bernardos,
  10-Jan-13, <draft-ietf-conex-mobile-01.txt>

    This memo describes a mobile communications use case for congestion
       exposure (CONEX) with a particular focus on mobile communication
       networks such as 3GPP Evoled Packet System (EPS).  The draft provides
       a brief overview of the architecture of these networks (both access
       and core networks), current QoS mechanisms and then discusses how
       congestion exposure concepts could be applied.  Based on this, this
       memo suggests a set of requirements for CONEX mechanisms that
       particularly apply to mobile networks.

Constrained RESTful Environments (core)
---------------------------------------

  "Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)", Zach Shelby, Klaus Hartke,
  Carsten Bormann, 26-May-13, <draft-ietf-core-coap-17.txt>

    The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web
       transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained
       (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks.  The nodes often have 8-bit
       microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained
       networks such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error rates and a
       typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s.  The protocol is designed for
       machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and
       building automation.
    
       CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between
       application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and
       resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and
       Internet media types.  CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP
       for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements
       such as multicast support, very low overhead and simplicity for
       constrained environments.

  "Blockwise transfers in CoAP", Carsten Bormann, Zach Shelby, 30-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-core-block-11.txt>

    CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and
       networks.  Basic CoAP messages work well for the small payloads we
       expect from temperature sensors, light switches, and similar
       building-automation devices.  Occasionally, however, applications
       will need to transfer larger payloads -\u002D for instance, for
       firmware updates.  With HTTP, TCP does the grunt work of slicing
       large payloads up into multiple packets and ensuring that they all
       arrive and are handled in the right order.
    
       CoAP is based on datagram transports such as UDP or DTLS, which
       limits the maximum size of resource representations that can be
       transferred without too much fragmentation.  Although UDP supports
       larger payloads through IP fragmentation, it is limited to 64 KiB
       and, more importantly, doesn't really work well for constrained
       applications and networks.
    
       Instead of relying on IP fragmentation, this specification extends
       basic CoAP with a pair of "Block" options, for transferring multiple
       blocks of information from a resource representation in multiple
       request-response pairs.  In many important cases, the Block options
       enable a server to be truly stateless: the server can handle each
       block transfer separately, with no need for a connection setup or
       other server-side memory of previous block transfers.
    
       In summary, the Block options provide a minimal way to transfer
       larger representations in a block-wise fashion.
    
       The present revision -11 fixes one example and adds the text and
       examples about the Block/Observe interaction, taken from -observe.
       It also adds a couple of formatting bugs from the new xml2rfc.  The
       "grand rewrite" is next.

  "Observing Resources in CoAP", Klaus Hartke, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-core-observe-08.txt>

    CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and
       networks.  The state of a resource on a CoAP server can change over
       time.  This document specifies a simple protocol extension for CoAP
       that enables CoAP clients to "observe" resources, i.e., to retrieve
       a representation of a resource and keep this representation updated
       by the server over a period of time.  The protocol follows a best-
       effort approach for sending new representations to clients, and
       provides eventual consistency between the state observed by each
       client and the actual resource state at the server.

  "Group Communication for CoAP", Akbar Rahman, Esko Dijk, 29-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-core-groupcomm-09.txt>

    CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained devices and
       constrained networks.  It is anticipated that constrained devices
       will often naturally operate in groups (e.g., in a building
       automation scenario all lights in a given room may need to be
       switched on/off as a group).  This document provides guidance for how
       the CoAP protocol should be used in a group communication context.
       An approach for using CoAP on top of IP multicast is detailed.  Also,
       various use cases and corresponding protocol flows are provided to
       illustrate important concepts.  Finally, guidance is provided for
       deployment in various network topologies.

  "Representing CoRE Link Collections in JSON", Carsten Bormann, 2-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-core-links-json-00.txt>

    Web Linking (RFC5988) provides a way to represent links between Web
       resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes
       of such a link.  In constrained networks, a collection of Web links
       can be exchanged in the CoRE link format (RFC6690).  Outside of
       constrained environments, it may be useful to represent these
       collections of Web links in JSON format (RFC4627).
    
       This specification defines a common format for representing Web links
       in JSON format.

  "Best Practices for HTTP-CoAP Mapping Implementation", Angelo
  Castellani, Salvatore Loreto, Akbar Rahman, Thomas Fossati, Esko Dijk,
  3-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-core-http-mapping-00.txt>

    This draft provides reference information for HTTP-CoAP protocol
       translation proxy implementors, focusing primarily on the reverse
       proxy case.  It details deployment options, discusses possible
       approaches for URI mapping, and provides a set of guidelines and
       considerations related to protocol translation.

  "CoRE Interfaces", Zach Shelby, Matthieu Vial, 3-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-core-interfaces-00.txt>

    This document defines well-known REST interface descriptions for
       Batch, Sensor, Parameter and Actuator types for use in contrained web
       servers using the CoRE Link Format.  A short reference is provided
       for each type that can be efficiently included in the interface
       description attribute of the CoRE Link Format.  These descriptions
       are intended to be for general use in resource designs or for
       inclusion in more specific interface profiles.  In addition, this
       document defines the concepts of Function Set and Binding.  The
       former is the basis element to create RESTful profiles and the latter
       helps the configuration of links between resources located on one or
       more endpoints.

  "CoRE Resource Directory", Zach Shelby, Srdjan Krco, Carsten Bormann,
  3-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-core-resource-directory-00.txt>

    In many M2M applications, direct discovery of resources is not
       practical due to sleeping nodes, disperse networks, or networks where
       multicast traffic is inefficient.  These problems can be solved by
       employing an entity called a Resource Directory (RD), which hosts
       descriptions of resources held on other servers, allowing lookups to
       be performed for those resources.  This document specifies the web
       interfaces that a Resource Directory supports in order for web
       servers to discover the RD and to register, maintain, lookup and
       remove resources descriptions.  Furthermore, new link attributes
       useful in conjunction with an RD are defined.

Call Control UUI Service for SIP (cuss)
---------------------------------------

  "A Mechanism for Transporting User to User Call Control Information in
  SIP", Alan Johnston, James Rafferty, 9-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-cuss-sip-uui-10.txt>

    There is a class of applications which benefit from using SIP to
       exchange User to User Information (UUI) data during session
       establishment.  This information, known as call control UUI data, is
       a small piece of data inserted by an application initiating the
       session, and utilized by an application accepting the session.  The
       rules which apply for a specific application are defined by a UUI
       package.  This UUI data is opaque to SIP and its function is
       unrelated to any basic SIP function.  This document defines a new SIP
       header field, User-to-User, to transport UUI data, along with an
       extension mechanism.

DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (dane)
-------------------------------------------------

  "Using Secure DNS to Associate Certificates with Domain Names For
  S/MIME", Paul Hoffman, Jakob Schlyter, 19-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-dane-smime-01.txt>

    This document describes how to use secure DNS to associate an S/MIME
       user's certificate with the intended domain name, similar to the way
       that DANE (RFC 6698) does for TLS.

  "Secure SMTP using DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)
  TLSA records.", Tony Finch, 25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-dane-smtp-01.txt>

    SMTP has a STARTTLS extension, but (especially in the case of inter-
       domain mail transfer) it only provides very limited security because
       it does not specify how to authenticate the server's certificate.
       This memo specifies how TLSA records in the DNS can be used for
       proper SMTP server authentication.

  "Using DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) TLSA records
  with SRV and MX records.", Tony Finch, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-dane-srv-02.txt>

    The DANE specification [RFC6698] describes how to use TLSA resource
       records in the DNS to associate a server's host name with its TLS
       certificate.  The association is secured with DNSSEC.  Some
       application protocols can use SRV records [RFC2782] to indirectly
       name the server hosts for a service domain.  (SMTP uses MX records
       for the same purpose.)  This specification gives generic instructions
       for how these application protocols locate and use TLSA records.
       Separate documents give the details that are specific to particular
       application protocols.

Dynamic Host Configuration (dhc)
--------------------------------

  "Guidelines for Creating New DHCPv6 Options", David Hankins, Tomek
  Mrugalski, Marcin Siodelski, Sheng Jiang, Suresh Krishnan, 9-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-option-guidelines-11.txt>

    This document provides guidance to prospective DHCPv6 Option
       developers to help them creating option formats that are easily
       adoptable by existing DHCPv6 software.  This document updates
       RFC3315.

  "Container Option for Server Configuration", Ralph Droms, Reinaldo
  Penno, 8-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-dhc-container-opt-07.txt>

    In some DHCP service deployments, it is desirable for a DHCP server
       in one administrative domain to pass configuration options to a DHCP
       server in a different administrative domain.  This DHCP option
       carries a set of DHCP options that can be used by another DHCP
       server.

  "Prefix Assignment in DHCPv6", Sheng Jiang, Frank Xia, Behcet Sarikaya,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-dhc-host-gen-id-05.txt>

    This document introduces a generic host-oriented prefix assignment
       mechanism using DHCPv6.  In this new address configuration procedure,
       the prefix is assigned from a DHCPv6 server to hosts through DHCPv6
       message exchanging while the interface identifiers are independently
       generated by the hosts.  It enables both integral address assignment
       and self-generated addresses in one single mechanism, DHCPv6.  It
       also enables stateless address configuration without RA attendance.
       The technique described in this document can be used in networks
       which assign IPv6 addresses using DHCPv6, e.g.  WiMAX.

  "DHCPv6 Failover Requirements", Tomek Mrugalski, Kim Kinnear, 10-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-requirements-05.txt>

    The DHCPv6 protocol, defined in [RFC3315] allows for multiple servers
       to operate on a single network, however it does not define any way
       the servers could share information about currently active clients
       and their leases.  Some sites are interested in running multiple
       servers in such a way as to provide increased availability in case of
       server failure.  In order for this to work reliably, the cooperating
       primary and secondary servers must maintain a consistent database of
       the lease information.  [RFC3315] allows for but does not define any
       redundancy or failover mechanisms.  This document outlines
       requirements for DHCPv6 failover, enumerates related problems, and
       discusses the proposed scope of work to be conducted.  This document
       does not define a DHCPv6 failover protocol.

  "DHCPv4 over IPv6 Transport", Yong Cui, Peng Wu, Jianping Wu, Ted Lemon,
  20-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6-06.txt>

    In IPv6 networks, there remains a need to provide IPv4 service for
       some residual devices.  This document describes a mechanism for
       allocating IPv4 addresses to such devices, using DHCPv4 with an IPv6
       transport.  It is done by putting a special relay agent function
       (Client Relay Agent) on the client side, as well as extending the
       behavior of the server; in the case where DHCP server only supports
       IPv4 transport, a relay agent is extended to support IPv6 transport
       (IPv6-Transport Relay Agent) and relay DHCP traffic for the server,
       with a new Relay Agent Information sub-option added to carry the IPv6
       address of the Client Relay Agent.

  "RADIUS Option for DHCPv6 Relay Agent",  leaf.yeh.sdo@gmail.com, Mohamed
  Boucadair, 20-May-13, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-radius-opt-12.txt>

    The DHCPv6 RADIUS option provides a mechanism to exchange
       authorization and identification information between the DHCPv6 relay
       agent and the DHCPv6 server.  This mechanism is meant for the
       centralized DHCPv6 server to select the right configuration for the
       requesting DHCPv6 client based on the authorization information
       received from the RADIUS server, which is not co-located with the
       DHCPv6 server.  The Network Access Server (NAS) acts as DHCPv6 relay
       agent and RADIUS client simultaneously in this document.

  "Issues with multiple stateful DHCPv6 options", Ole Troan, Bernie Volz,
  13-May-13, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-stateful-issues-04.txt>

    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) was not written
       with the expectation that additional stateful DHCPv6 options would be
       developed.  IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration
       Protocol (DHCP) version 6 shoe-horned the new options for Prefix
       Delegation into DHCPv6.  Implementation experience of the CPE model
       described in [RFC6204] has shown multiple issues with the DHCPv6
       protocol in supporting multiple stateful options.

  "A Generic IPv6 Addresses Registration Solution Using DHCPv6", Sheng
  Jiang, Gang Chen, Suresh Krishnan, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-addr-registration-02.txt>

    In networks that are centrally managed, self-generated addresses
       cause traceability issues due to their decentralized nature.  To
       minimize the issues due to lack of traceability, these self-generated
       addresses can be registered with the network for allowing centralized
       address administration.  This document defines a generic address
       registration solution using DHCPv6, using a new ND option and a new
       DHCPv6 option in order to communicate the use of self-generated
       addresses.  A new Addr-registration-request message type is defined
       for initiate the address registration request, among with two new
       Status codes to indicate registration errors on the server side.

  "Prefix Pool Option for DHCPv6 Relay Agent on the Provider Edge
  Routers",  leaf.yeh.sdo@gmail.com, Ted Lemon, Mohamed Boucadair,
  25-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-prefix-pool-opt-03.txt>

    The DHCPv6 Prefix Pool option provides a mechanism for DHCPv6 Prefix
       Delegation (DHCPv6-PD), allowing the DHCPv6 server to notify a DHCPv6
       relay agent implemented on a Provider Edge (PE) router about active
       prefix pools allocated by the DHCPv6 server to the PE router.  The
       information of active prefix pools can be used to enforce IPv6 route
       aggregation on the PE router through adding or removing aggregation
       routes according to the status of the prefix pools.  The advertising
       of the aggregation routes in the routing protocol enabled on the
       network-facing interface of PE routers will dramatically decreases
       the number of the routing table entries in the ISP network.

  "Reconfigure Triggered by DHCPv6 Relay Agents", Mohamed Boucadair,
  Xavier Pougnard, 15-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-triggered-reconfigure-07.txt>

    This document defines new DHCPv6 messages: Reconfigure-Request and
       Reconfigure-Reply.  Reconfigure-Request message is sent by a DHCPv6
       relay agent to notify a DHCPv6 server about a configuration
       information change, so that the DHCPv6 server can send a Reconfigure
       message accordingly.  Reconfigure-Reply message is used by the server
       to acknowledge the receipt of Reconfigure-Request.

  "Modification to Default Value of SOL_MAX_RT", Ralph Droms, 3-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-solmaxrt-update-01.txt>

    This document updates RFC 3315 by redefining the default values for
       SOL_MAX_RT and INF_MAX_RT, and defining options through which a
       DHCPv6 server can override the client's default value for SOL_MAX_RT
       and INF_MAX_RT with a new value.

  "Populating the DNS Reverse Tree for DHCP Delegated Prefixes", Ted
  Lemon, 11-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-dhc-dns-pd-00.txt>

    This document describes three alternatives for populating the DNS
       reverse tree for prefixes delegated using DHCP, and provides
       mechanisms for implementing each alternative.

  "Customizing DHCP Configuration on the Basis of Network Topology", Ted
  Lemon, 13-Apr-13, <draft-lemon-dhc-topo-conf-01.txt>

    DHCP servers have evolved over the years to provide significant
       functionality beyond that which is described in the DHCP base
       specifications.  One aspect of this functionality is support for
       context-specific configuration information.  This memo describes some
       such features and makes recommendations as to how they can be used.

  "Handling Unknown DHCPv6 Messages", Yong Cui, Qi Sun, Ted Lemon,
  23-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-unknown-msg-00.txt>

    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) isn't specific
       about handling messages with unknown types.  This document describes
       the problems and defines how a DHCPv6 function node should behave in
       this case.  This document updates RFC3315.

  "DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Transport", Qi Sun, Yong Cui, Marcin Siodelski,
  Suresh Krishnan, Ian Farrer, 26-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6-00.txt>

    This document describes a mechanism for obtaining IPv4 address and
       other parameters in IPv6 networks by carrying DHCPv4 messages over
       DHCPv6 transport.

  "Provisioning IPv4 Configuration Over IPv6 Only Networks", Branimir
  Rajtar, Ian Farrer, 28-May-13, <draft-ietf-dhc-v4configuration-01.txt>

    As IPv6 becomes more widely adopted, some service providers are
       taking the approach of deploying IPv6 only networks, without dual-
       stack functionality for IPv4.  However, access to IPv4 based services
       is still an ongoing requirement and approaches such as IPv4-in-IPv6
       softwire tunnels are being developed to meet this need.
    
       In order to provision end-user's hosts with the necessary IPv4
       configuration, a number of different mechanisms have been proposed.
       This memo discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each, with the aim
       of recommending a single approach as the basis for future work.

  "Access-Network-Identifier Option in DHCP", Cisco Systems, Sri
  Gundavelli, Jouni Korhonen, Mark Grayson, 14-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-access-network-identifier-00.txt>

    This document specifies the format and mechanism that is to be used
       for encoding access network identifiers in DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 messages
       by defining new access network identifier options and sub-options.

Diameter Maintenance and Extensions (dime)
------------------------------------------

  "Diameter Applications Design Guidelines", Lionel Morand, Victor
  Fajardo, Hannes Tschofenig, 6-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-dime-app-design-guide-18.txt>

    The Diameter base protocol provides facilities for protocol
       extensibility enabling to define new Diameter applications or modify
       existing applications.  This document is a companion document to the
       Diameter Base protocol that further explains and clarifies the rules
       to extend Diameter.  It is meant as a guidelines document and
       therefore as informative in nature.

  "Realm-Based Redirection In Diameter", Tina Tsou, Ruibing Hao, Tom
  Taylor, 20-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-dime-realm-based-redirect-09.txt>

    The Diameter protocol allows a Diameter redirect agent to return to
       the message sender one or more individual hosts as destinations of
       the redirected message.  However, in some circumstances an operator
       may wish to redirect messages to an alternate domain without
       specifying individual hosts.  This document specifies a mechanism by
       which this can be achieved.  New applications may incorporate this
       capability by reference to the present document.
    
       This memo updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of RFC6733 with respect to
       the usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time
       AVPs.

  "Diameter Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6 Localized Routing", Glen Zorn,
  Wenson Wu, Jouni Korhonen, 1-Aug-12, <draft-ietf-dime-pmip6-lr-18.txt>

    In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the
       Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically
       tunneled to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing.  The term
       "localized routing" refers to a method by which packets are routed
       directly between an MN's MAG and the MAG of its Correspondent Node
       (CN) without involving any LMA.  In a Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployment,
       it may be desirable to control the establishment of localized routing
       sessions between two MAGs in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain by requiring
       that the session be authorized.  This document specifies how to
       accomplish this using the Diameter protocol.

  "Diameter Network Access Server Application", Glen Zorn, 13-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-dime-rfc4005bis-13.txt>

    This document describes the Diameter protocol application used for
       Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) services in the
       Network Access Server (NAS) environment; it obsoletes RFC 4005.  When
       combined with the Diameter Base protocol, Transport Profile, and
       Extensible Authentication Protocol specifications, this application
       specification satisfies typical network access services requirements.

  "Diameter Overload Control Requirements", Eric McMurry, Ben Campbell,
  6-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-dime-overload-reqs-07.txt>

    When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be
       able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to
       reduce sending traffic for some period of time.  Otherwise, it must
       continue to expend resources parsing and responding to Diameter
       messages, possibly resulting in congestion collapse.  The existing
       Diameter mechanisms, listed in Section 3 are not sufficient for this
       purpose.  This document describes the limitations of the existing
       mechanisms in Section 4.  Requirements for new overload management
       mechanisms are provided in Section 7.

Distributed Mobility Management (dmm)
-------------------------------------

  "Requirements for Distributed Mobility Management", Anthony Chan, Dapeng
  Liu, Pierrick Seite, Hidetoshi Yokota, Jouni Korhonen, 5-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-dmm-requirements-05.txt,.pdf>

    This document defines the requirements for Distributed Mobility
       Management (DMM) in IPv6 deployments.  The hierarchical structure in
       traditional wireless networks has led to deployment models which are
       in practice centralized.  Mobility management with logically
       centralized mobility anchoring in current mobile networks is prone to
       suboptimal routing and raises scalability issues.  Such centralized
       functions can lead to single points of failure and inevitably
       introduce longer delays and higher signaling loads for network
       operations related to mobility management.  The objective is to
       enhance mobility management in order to meet the primary goals in
       network evolution, i.e., improve scalability, avoid single points of
       failure, enable transparent mobility support to upper layers only
       when needed, and so on.  Distributed mobility management must be
       secure and may co-exist with existing network deployments and end
       hosts.

  "Distributed Mobility Management: Current practices and gap analysis",
  Dapeng Liu, Juan Zuniga, Pierrick Seite, Anthony Chan, Carlos Bernardos,
  17-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-dmm-best-practices-gap-analysis-01.txt>

    The present document analyses deplyment practices of existing
       mobility protocols in a distributed mobility management environment.
       It also identifies some limitations compared to the expected
       functionality of a fully distributed mobility management system.  The
       comparison is made taking into account the identified DMM
       requirements.

DNS Extensions (dnsext)
-----------------------

  "Signaling Cryptographic Algorithm Understanding in DNSSEC", Steve
  Crocker, Scott Rose, 8-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-dnsext-dnssec-algo-signal-10.txt>

    The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin
       authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital
       signatures.  These digital signatures can be generated using
       different algorithms.  This draft sets out to specify a way for
       validating end-system resolvers to signal to a server which digital
       signature and hash algorithms they support.  The proposed extensions
       allow the signaling of new algorithm uptake in client code to allow
       zone administrators to know when it is possible to complete an
       algorithm rollover in a DNSSEC signed zone.

Data for Reachability of Inter/tra-NetworK SIP (drinks)
-------------------------------------------------------

  "Session Peering Provisioning Framework (SPPF)", Kenneth Cartwright,
  Vikas Bhatia, Syed Ali, David Schwartz, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-drinks-spp-framework-04.txt>

    This document specifies the data model and the overall structure for
       a framework to provision session establishment data into Session Data
       Registries and SIP Service Provider data stores.  The framework is
       called the Session Peering Provisioning Framework (SPPF).  The
       provisioned data is typically used by network elements for session
       establishment.

Emergency Context Resolution with Internet Technologies (ecrit)
---------------------------------------------------------------

  "Additional Data related to an Emergency Call", Brian Rosen, Hannes
  Tschofenig, Roger Marshall, Randy, 28-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-ecrit-additional-data-09.txt>

    When an emergency call is sent to a Public Safety Answering Point
       (PSAP), the device that sends it, as well as any application service
       provider in the path of the call, or access network provider through
       which the call originated may have information about the call or the
       caller which the PSAP may be able to use.  This document describes
       data structures and a mechanism to convey such data to the PSAP.  The
       mechanism uses a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which may point
       to either an external resource or an object in the body of the SIP
       message.  The mechanism thus allows the data to be passed by
       reference (when the URI points to an external resource) or by value
       (when it points into the body of the message).  This follows the
       tradition of prior emergency services standardization work where data
       can be conveyed by value within the call signaling (i.e., in body of
       the SIP message) and also by reference.

  "Data-Only Emergency Calls", Brian Rosen, Henning Schulzrinne, Hannes
  Tschofenig, 25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-ecrit-data-only-ea-05.txt>

    RFC 6443 'Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia'
       describes how devices use the Internet to place emergency calls and
       how Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) can handle Internet
       multimedia emergency calls natively.  The exchange of multimedia
       traffic typically involves a SIP session establishment starting with
       a SIP INVITE that negotiates various parameters for that session.
    
       In some cases, however, the transmission of application data is
       everything that is needed.  Examples of such environments include a
       temperature sensors issuing alerts, or vehicles sending crash data.
       Often these alerts are conveyed as one-shot data transmissions.
       These type of interactions are called 'data-only emergency calls'.
       This document describes a container for the data based on the Common
       Alerting Protocol (CAP) and its transmission using the SIP MESSAGE
       transaction.

  "Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) Callback", Henning Schulzrinne,
  Hannes Tschofenig, Christer Holmberg, Milan Patel, 19-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-ecrit-psap-callback-09.txt>

    After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated
       by the emergency caller or normally by the call taker) it is possible
       that the call taker feels the need for further communication.  For
       example, the call may have been dropped by accident without the call
       taker having sufficient information about the current situation of a
       wounded person.  A call taker may trigger a callback towards the
       emergency caller using the contact information provided with the
       initial emergency call.  This callback could, under certain
       circumstances, be treated like any other call and as a consequence it
       may get blocked by authorization policies or may get forwarded to an
       answering machine.
    
       The IETF emergency services architecture specification already offers
       a solution approach for allowing PSAP callbacks to bypass
       authorization policies to reach the caller without unnecessary
       delays.  Unfortunately, the specified mechanism only supports limited
       scenarios.  This document discusses shortcomings of the current
       mechanisms and illustrates additional scenarios where better-than-
       normal call treatment behavior would be desirable.  A solution based
       on a new header field value, called "psap-callback", for the SIP
       Priority header field is specified to accomplish the PSAP callback
       marking.

  "Trustworthy Location", Hannes Tschofenig, Henning Schulzrinne, Bernard
  Aboba, 13-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-ecrit-trustworthy-location-05.txt>

    For some location-based applications, such as emergency calling or
       roadside assistance, the trustworthiness of location information is
       critically important.
    
       This document describes how to convey location in a manner that is
       inherently secure and reliable.  It also provides guidelines for
       assessing the trustworthiness of location information.

  "Extensions to the Emergency Services Architecture for dealing with
  Unauthenticated and Unauthorized Devices", Henning Schulzrinne, Stephen
  McCann, Gabor Bajko, Hannes Tschofenig, Dirk Kroeselberg, 30-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-ecrit-unauthenticated-access-06.txt>

    The IETF emergency services architecture assumes that the calling
       device has acquired rights to use the access network or that no
       authentication is required for the access network, such as for public
       wireless access points.  Subsequent protocol interactions, such as
       obtaining location information, learning the address of the Public
       Safety Answering Point (PSAP) and the emergency call itself are
       largely decoupled from the underlying network access procedures.
    
       In some cases, however, the device does not have these credentials
       for network access, does not have a VoIP service provider, or the
       credentials have become invalid, e.g., because the user has exhausted
       their prepaid balance or the account has expired.
    
       This document provides a problem statement, introduces terminology
       and describes an extension for the base IETF emergency services
       architecture to address these scenarios.

  "Policy for defining new service-identifying lables", Andrea Forte,
  Henning Schulzrinne, 20-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-ecrit-service-urn-policy-02.txt>

    In order to provide location-based services, descriptive terms for
       services need to be defined.  This document updates the policy for
       defining new service-identifying labels.

  "URN For Country Specific Emergency Services", Christer Holmberg, Ivo
  Sedlacek, 29-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-ecrit-country-emg-urn-00.txt>

    This document updates section 4.2 of RFC 5031, in order to allow the
       registration of service URNs with the 'sos' service type for
       emergency services that, at the time of registration, are offered in
       one country only.

Energy Management (eman)
------------------------

  "Requirements for Energy Management", Juergen Quittek, Mouli
  Chandramouli, Rolf Winter, Thomas Dietz, Benoit Claise, 2-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-eman-requirements-14.txt>

    This document defines requirements for standards specifications for
       energy management.  The requirements defined in this document concern
       monitoring functions as well as control functions.  Monitoring
       functions include identification of energy-managed devices and their
       components, monitoring of their power states, power inlets, power
       outlets, actual power (the instantaneous power, as opposed to the
       demand, which is an averaged power), power attributes, received
       energy, provided energy, and contained batteries.  Control functions
       serve for controlling power supply and power state of energy-managed
       devices and their components.
       This document does not specify the features that must be implemented
       by compliant implementations but rather features that must be
       supported by standards for energy management.

  "Energy Management Framework", Benoit Claise, John Parello, Brad
  Schoening, Juergen Quittek, Bruce Nordman, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-eman-framework-07.txt>

    This document defines a framework for providing Energy
            Management for devices and device components within or
            connected to communication networks.  The framework defines an
            Energy Management Domain as a set of Energy Objects, for which
            each Energy Object is identified, classified and given
            context.   Energy Objects can be monitored and/or controlled
            with respect to Power, Power State, Energy, Demand, Power
            Attributes, and Battery.  Additionally the framework models
            relationships and capabilities between Energy Objects.

  "Energy Object Context MIB", John Parello, Benoit Claise, Mouli
  Chandramouli, 19-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-eman-energy-aware-mib-08.txt>

    This document defines a subset of a Management Information Base
            (MIB) for energy management of devices. The module addresses
            device identification, context information, and the
            relationships between reporting devices, remote devices, and
            monitoring devices.

  "Definition of Managed Objects for Battery Monitoring", Juergen Quittek,
  Rolf Winter, Thomas Dietz, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-eman-battery-mib-08.txt>

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
       for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
       In particular, it defines managed objects that provide information on
       the status of batteries in managed devices.

  "Power and Energy Monitoring MIB", Mouli Chandramouli, Brad Schoening,
  Juergen Quittek, Thomas Dietz, Benoit Claise, 22-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-eman-energy-monitoring-mib-05.txt>

    This document defines a subset of the Management Information
            Base (MIB) for power and energy monitoring of devices.

  "Energy Management (EMAN) Applicability Statement", Brad Schoening,
  Mouli Chandramouli, Bruce Nordman, 18-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-eman-applicability-statement-03.txt>

    The objective of Energy Management (EMAN) is to provide an
            energy management framework for networked devices.  This
            document presents the applicability of the EMAN framework to a
            variety of scenarios.  This document lists use cases and target
            devices that can potentially implement the EMAN framework and
            associated SNMP MIB modules.  These use cases are useful for
            identifying requirements for the framework and MIBs.  Further,
            we describe the relationship of the EMAN framework to relevant
            other energy monitoring standards and architectures.

EAP Method Update (emu)
-----------------------

  "Tunnel EAP Method (TEAP) Version 1", Hao Zhou, Nancy Cam-Winget, Joseph
  Salowey, Stephen Hanna, 22-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-emu-eap-tunnel-method-06.txt>

    This document defines the Tunnel Extensible Authentication Protocol
       (TEAP) version 1.  TEAP is a tunnel based EAP method that enables
       secure communication between a peer and a server by using the
       Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a mutually authenticated
       tunnel.  Within the tunnel, Type-Length-Value (TLV) objects are used
       to convey authentication related data between the EAP peer and the
       EAP server.

  "EAP Mutual Cryptographic Binding", Sam Hartman, Margaret Wasserman,
  Dacheng Zhang, 14-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-emu-crypto-bind-03.txt>

    As the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) evolves, EAP peers
       rely increasingly on information received from the EAP server.  EAP
       extensions such as channel binding or network posture information are
       often carried in tunnel methods; peers are likely to rely on this
       information.  [RFC 3748] is a facility that protects tunnel methods
       against man-in-the-middle attacks.  However, cryptographic binding
       focuses on protecting the server rather than the peer.  This memo
       explores attacks possible when the peer is not protected from man-in-
       the-middle attacks and recommends mutual cryptographic binding, a new
       form of cryptographic binding that protects both peer and server
       along with other mitigations.

Forwarding and Control Element Separation (forces)
--------------------------------------------------

  "ForCES Logical Function Block (LFB) Library", Weiming Wang, Evangelos
  Haleplidis, Kentaro Ogawa, Chuanhuang Li, Joel Halpern, 28-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-forces-lfb-lib-12.txt>

    This document defines basic classes of Logical Function Blocks (LFBs)
       used in the Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES).  The
       basic LFB classes are defined according to ForCES FE model and ForCES
       protocol specifications, and are scoped to meet requirements of
       typical router functions and considered as the basic LFB library for
       ForCES.  The library includes the descriptions of the LFBs and the
       XML definitions.

  "ForCES Intra-NE High Availability", Kentaro Ogawa, Weiming Wang,
  Evangelos Haleplidis, Jamal Hadi Salim, 8-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-forces-ceha-07.txt>

    This document discusses Control Element High Availability within a
       ForCES Network Element.

  "Interoperability Report for Forwarding and Control Element Separation
  (ForCES)", Weiming Wang, Kentaro Ogawa, Evangelos Haleplidis, Ming Gao,
  Jamal Hadi Salim, 2-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-forces-interop-09.txt>

    This document captures results of the second Forwarding and Control
       Element Separation (ForCES) interoperability test which took place on
       February 24-25, 2011 in the Internet Technology Lab (ITL) of Zhejiang
       Gongshang University, China.  RFC 6053 reported the results of the
       first ForCES interoperability test, and this document updates RFC
       6053 by providing further interoperability results.

General Area (gen)
------------------

  "Experiences from Cross-Area Work at the IETF", Jari Arkko, 6-Feb-13,
  <draft-arkko-iesg-crossarea-03.txt>

    This memo discusses the reasons for IETF work on topics that cross
       area boundaries.  Such cross-area work presents challenges for the
       organization of the IETF as well as on how interested parties can
       participate the work.  The memo also provides some suggestions on
       managing these challenges.

  "IMAP Access to IETF Email List Archives", Robert Sparks, 7-May-13,
  <draft-sparks-genarea-imaparch-07.txt>

    The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work.  This
       often involves accessing the archived history of those email lists.
       Participants would like to have the ability to browse and search
       those archives using standard IMAP clients.  This memo captures the
       requirements for providing a service that would allow such browsing
       and searching, and it is intended as input to a later activity for
       the design and development of such a service.

  "The Internet Numbers Registry System", Russ Housley, John Curran, Geoff
  Huston, David Conrad, 7-Apr-13, <draft-housley-rfc2050bis-01.txt>

    This document provides information about the current Internet Numbers
       Registry System used in the distribution of globally unique Internet
       Protocol (IP) address space and autonomous system (AS) numbers.
    
       This document also provides information about the processes for
       further evolution of the Internet Numbers Registry System.
    
       This document replaces RFC 2050.
    
       This document does not propose any changes to the Internet Numbers
       Registry System.

Geographic Location/Privacy (geopriv)
-------------------------------------

  "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) IPv4 and IPv6 Option for a
  Location Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)", James Polk, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-geopriv-dhcp-lbyr-uri-option-19.txt>

    This document creates a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
       Option for transmitting a client's geolocation Uniform Resource
       Identifier (URI). This Location URI can then be dereferenced in a
       separate transaction by the client or sent to another entity and
       dereferenced to learn physically where the client is located, but
       only while valid.

  "Using Device-provided Location-Related Measurements in Location
  Configuration Protocols", Martin Thomson, James Winterbottom, 10-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-geopriv-held-measurements-07.txt>

    A method is described by which a Device is able to provide location-
       related measurement data to a LIS within a request for location
       information.  Location-related measurement information are
       observations concerning properties related to the position of a
       Device, which could be data about network attachment or about the
       physical environment.  When a LIS generates location information for
       a Device, information from the Device can improve the accuracy of the
       location estimate.  A basic set of location-related measurements are
       defined, including common modes of network attachment as well as
       assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters.

  "Relative Location Representation", Martin Thomson, Brian Rosen, Dorothy
  Stanley, Gabor Bajko, Allan Thomson, 4-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-geopriv-relative-location-05.txt>

    This document defines an extension to PIDF-LO (RFC4119) for the
       expression of location information that is defined relative to a
       reference point.  The reference point may be expressed as a geodetic
       or civic location, and the relative offset may be one of several
       shapes.  An alternative binary representation is described.
    
       Optionally, a reference to a secondary document (such as a map image)
       can be included, along with the relationship of the map coordinate
       system to the reference/offset coordinate system to allow display of
       the map with the reference point and the relative offset.

  "Location Configuration Extensions for Policy Management", Richard
  Barnes, Martin Thomson, James Winterbottom, Hannes Tschofenig, 4-Oct-12,
  <draft-ietf-geopriv-policy-uri-07.txt>

    Current location configuration protocols are capable of provisioning
       an Internet host with a location URI that refers to the host's
       location.  These protocols lack a mechanism for the target host to
       inspect or set the privacy rules that are applied to the URIs they
       distribute.  This document extends the current location configuration
       protocols to provide hosts with a reference to the rules that are
       applied to a URI, so that the host can view or set these rules.

  "Location Information Server (LIS) Discovery using IP address and
  Reverse DNS", Martin Thomson, Ray Bellis, 5-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-geopriv-res-gw-lis-discovery-05.txt>

    The residential gateway is a device that has become an integral part
       of home networking equipment.  Discovering a Location Information
       Server (LIS) is a necessary part of acquiring location information
       for location-based services.  However, discovering a LIS when a
       residential gateway is present poses a configuration challenge,
       requiring a method that is able to work around the obstacle presented
       by the gateway.
    
       This document describes a solution to this problem.  The solution
       provides alternative domain names as input to the LIS discovery
       process based on the network addresses assigned to a Device.

Global Routing Operations (grow)
--------------------------------

  "Operational Requirements for Enhanced Error Handling Behaviour in
  BGP-4", Rob Shakir, 27-Dec-12,
  <draft-ietf-grow-ops-reqs-for-bgp-error-handling-06.txt>

    BGP is utilised as a key intra- and inter-autonomous system routing
       protocol in modern IP networks.  The failure modes, as defined by the
       original protocol standards, are based on a number of assumptions
       around the impact of session failure.  Numerous incidents both in the
       global Internet routing table and within service provider networks
       have been caused by strict handling of a single invalid UPDATE
       message causing large-scale failures in one or more autonomous
       systems.
    
       This memo describes the current use of BGP within service provider
       networks, and outlines a set of requirements for further work to
       enhance the mechanisms available to a BGP implementation when
       erroneous data is detected.  Whilst this document does not provide
       specification of any standard, it is intended as an overview of a set
       of enhancements to BGP to improve the protocol's robustness to suit
       its current deployment.

  "IRR & Routing Policy Configuration Considerations", Danny McPherson,
  Shane Amante, Eric Osterweil, Larry Blunk, Dave Mitchell, 10-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-grow-irr-routing-policy-considerations-01.txt>

    The purpose of this document is to catalog past issues influencing
       the efficacy of Internet Routing Registries (IRR) for inter-domain
       routing policy specification and application in the global routing
       system over the past two decades.  Additionally, it provides a
       discussion regarding which of these issues are still problematic in
       practice, and which are simply artifacts that are no longer
       applicable but continue to stifle inter-provider policy-based
       filtering adoption and IRR utility to this day.

  "Route Leaks & MITM Attacks Against BGPSEC", Danny McPherson, Shane
  Amante, Eric Osterweil, Dave Mitchell, 10-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-grow-simple-leak-attack-bgpsec-no-help-01.txt>

    This document describes a very simple attack vector that illustrates
       how RPKI-enabled BGPSEC machinery as currently defined can be easily
       circumvented in order to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack via
       BGP.  It is meant to serve as input to the IETF's Secure Inter-Domain
       Routing working group during routing security requirements
       discussions and subsequent specification.

Host Identity Protocol (hip)
----------------------------

  "Host Identity Protocol-Based Overlay Networking Environment (HIP BONE)
  Instance Specification for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD)",
  Ari Keranen, Gonzalo Camarillo, Jouni Maenpaa, 10-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-hip-reload-instance-08.txt>

    This document is the Host Identity Protocol-Based Overlay Networking
       Environment (HIP BONE) instance specification for the REsource
       LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) protocol.  The document provides the
       details needed to build a RELOAD-based overlay that uses HIP.

  "An IPv6 Prefix for Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers
  Version 2 (ORCHIDv2)", Julien Laganier, Francis Dupont, 6-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-hip-rfc4843-bis-04.txt>

    This document specifies an updated Overlay Routable Cryptographic
       Hash Identifiers format that obsoletes the earlier format defined in
       [RFC4843].  These identifiers are intended to be used as endpoint
       identifiers at applications and Application Programming Interfaces
       (API) and not as identifiers for network location at the IP layer,
       i.e., locators.  They are designed to appear as application layer
       entities and at the existing IPv6 APIs, but they should not appear in
       actual IPv6 headers.  To make them more like regular IPv6 addresses,
       they are expected to be routable at an overlay level.  Consequently,
       while they are considered non-routable addresses from the IPv6 layer
       point-of-view, all existing IPv6 applications are expected to be able
       to use them in a manner compatible with current IPv6 addresses.
    
       The Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers originally
       defined in [RFC4843] lacked a mechanism for cryptographic algorithm
       agility.  The updated ORCHID format specified in this document
       removes this limitation by encoding in the identifier itself an index
       to the suite of cryptographic algorithms in use.

  "Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2)", Robert Moskowitz, Tobias
  Heer, Petri Jokela, Tom Henderson, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis-11.txt>

    This document specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol
       (HIP).  HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and
       maintain shared IP-layer state, allowing separation of the identifier
       and locator roles of IP addresses, thereby enabling continuity of
       communications across IP address changes.  HIP is based on a SIGMA-
       compliant Diffie-Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers
       from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication.
       The protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS)
       and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  When used together with
       another suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulated Security
       Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional
       encryption for upper-layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.
    
       This document obsoletes RFC 5201 and addresses the concerns raised by
       the IESG, particularly that of crypto agility.  It also incorporates
       lessons learned from the implementations of RFC 5201.

  "Host Mobility with the Host Identity Protocol", Tom Henderson,
  Christian Vogt, Jari Arkko, 16-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-hip-rfc5206-bis-05.txt>

    This document defines mobility extensions to the Host Identity
       Protocol (HIP).  Specifically, this document defines a general
       "LOCATOR_SET" parameter for HIP messages that allows for a HIP host
       to notify peers about alternate addresses at which it may be reached.
       This document also defines elements of procedure for mobility of a
       HIP host -- the process by which a host dynamically changes the
       primary locator that it uses to receive packets.  While the same
       LOCATOR_SET parameter can also be used to support end-host
       multihoming, detailed procedures are out of scope for this document.
       This document obsoletes RFC 5206.

  "Native NAT Traversal Mode for the Host Identity Protocol", Ari Keranen,
  Jan Melen, 14-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-hip-native-nat-traversal-05.txt>

    This document specifies a new Network Address Translator (NAT)
       traversal mode for the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  The new mode is
       based on the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) methodology
       and UDP encapsulation of data and signaling traffic.  The main
       difference from the previously specified modes is the use of HIP
       messages for all NAT traversal procedures.

  "Using the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) Transport Format with
  the Host Identity Protocol (HIP)", Petri Jokela, Robert Moskowitz, Jan
  Melen, 10-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-hip-rfc5202-bis-02.txt>

    This memo specifies an Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) based
       mechanism for transmission of user data packets, to be used with the
       Host Identity Protocol (HIP).

  "Host Multihoming with the Host Identity Protocol", Tom Henderson,
  Christian Vogt, Jari Arkko, 16-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-hip-multihoming-02.txt>

    This document defines host multihoming extensions to the Host
       Identity Protocol (HIP), by leveraging protocol components defined
       for host mobility.

  "Host Identity Protocol Certificates", Tobias Heer, Samu Varjonen,
  1-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-hip-rfc6253-bis-00.txt>

    The CERT parameter is a container for digital certificates.  It is
       used for carrying these certificates in Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
       control packets.  This document specifies the certificate parameter
       and the error signaling in case of a failed verification.
       Additionally, this document specifies the representations of Host
       Identity Tags in X.509 version 3 (v3) and SPKI certificates.
    
       The concrete use of certificates including how certificates are
       obtained, requested, and which actions are taken upon successful or
       failed verification are specific to the scenario in which the
       certificates are used.  Hence, the definition of these scenario-
       specific aspects are left to the documents that use the CERT
       parameter.
    
       This document updates RFC 5201.

Home Networking (homenet)
-------------------------

  "Home Networking Architecture for IPv6", Tim Chown, Jari Arkko, Anders
  Brandt, Ole Troan, Jason Weil, 21-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-homenet-arch-08.txt>

    This text describes evolving networking technology within
       increasingly large residential home networks.  The goal of this
       document is to define a general architecture for IPv6-based home
       networking, describing the associated principles, considerations and
       requirements.  The text briefly highlights specific implications of
       the introduction of IPv6 for home networking, discusses the elements
       of the architecture, and suggests how standard IPv6 mechanisms and
       addressing can be employed in home networking.  The architecture
       describes the need for specific protocol extensions for certain
       additional functionality.  It is assumed that the IPv6 home network
       is not actively managed, and runs as an IPv6-only or dual-stack
       network.  There are no recommendations in this text for the IPv4 part
       of the network.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Authentication (httpauth)
-----------------------------------------------------

  "HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA)", Stephen Farrell, Paul
  Hoffman, Michael Thomas, 14-May-13, <draft-ietf-httpauth-hoba-00.txt>

    HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a design for an HTTP
       authentication method with credentials that are not vulnerable to
       phishing attacks, and that does not require a server-side password
       database.  The design can also be used in Javascript-based
       authentication embedded in HTML.  HOBA is an alternative to HTTP
       authentication schemes that require passwords with all the negative
       attributes that come with password-based systems.  HOBA can be
       integrated with account management and other applications running
       over HTTP and supports portability, so a user can associate more than
       one device or origin-bound key with the same service.  We also
       describe a way in which the HOBA design can be used from a Javascript
       web client.  When deployed, HOBA will be a drop-in replacement for
       password-based HTTP authentication or JavaScript authentication.

  "An Encoding Parameter for HTTP Basic Authentication", Julian Reschke,
  16-May-13, <draft-ietf-httpauth-basicauth-enc-00.txt>

    The "Basic" authentication scheme defined in RFC 2617 does not
       properly define how to treat non-ASCII characters.  This has lead to
       a situation where user agent implementations disagree, and servers
       make different assumptions based on the locales they are running in.
       There is little interoperability for the non-ASCII characters in the
       ISO-8859-1 character set, and even less interoperability for any
       characters beyond that.
    
       This document defines a backwards-compatible extension to "Basic",
       specifying the server's character encoding expectation, using a new
       authentication scheme parameter.

  "HTTP Digest Update", Rifaat Shekh-Yusef, David Ahrens, 22-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-httpauth-digest-update-01.txt>

    This documents specifies extensions to the HTTP Digest Authentication
       mechanism to add support for new digest algorithms to the HTTP Digest
       Access Authentication scheme.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Bis (httpbis)
-----------------------------------------

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing",
  Roy Fielding, Julian Reschke, 23-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging-22.txt>

    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
       protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
       systems.  HTTP has been in use by the World Wide Web global
       information initiative since 1990.  This document provides an
       overview of HTTP architecture and its associated terminology, defines
       the "http" and "https" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes,
       defines the HTTP/1.1 message syntax and parsing requirements, and
       describes general security concerns for implementations.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content", Roy
  Fielding, Julian Reschke, 23-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics-22.txt>

    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
       protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
       systems.  This document defines the semantics of HTTP/1.1 messages,
       as expressed by request methods, request header fields, response
       status codes, and response header fields, along with the payload of
       messages (metadata and body content) and mechanisms for content
       negotiation.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests", Roy
  Fielding, Julian Reschke, 23-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-p4-conditional-22.txt>

    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
       protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
       systems.  This document defines HTTP/1.1 conditional requests,
       including metadata header fields for indicating state changes,
       request header fields for making preconditions on such state, and
       rules for constructing the responses to a conditional request when
       one or more preconditions evaluate to false.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests", Roy Fielding,
  Yves Lafon, Julian Reschke, 23-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-p5-range-22.txt>

    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
       protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
       systems.  This document defines range requests and the rules for
       constructing and combining responses to those requests.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching", Roy Fielding, Mark
  Nottingham, Julian Reschke, 23-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-p6-cache-22.txt>

    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
       protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
       systems.  This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the
       associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate
       cacheable response messages.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Authentication", Roy Fielding,
  Julian Reschke, 23-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-httpbis-p7-auth-22.txt>

    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
       protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
       systems.  This document defines the HTTP Authentication framework.

  "Initial Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Method Registrations",
  Julian Reschke, 23-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-method-registrations-11.txt>

    This document registers those Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
       methods which have been defined in standards-track RFCs before the
       IANA HTTP Method Registry was established.

  "Initial Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Scheme
  Registrations", Julian Reschke, 23-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-authscheme-registrations-06.txt>

    This document registers Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
       authentication schemes which have been defined in standards-track
       RFCs before the IANA HTTP Authentication Scheme Registry was
       established.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2.0", Mike Belshe, Roberto Peon,
  Martin Thomson, Alexey Melnikov, 29-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-03.txt>

    This specification describes an optimized expression of the syntax of
       the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  The HTTP/2.0 encapsulation
       enables more efficient use of network resources and reduced
       perception of latency by allowing header field compression and
       multiple concurrent messages on the same connection.  It also
       introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to
       clients.
    
       This document is an alternative to, but does not obsolete the
       HTTP/1.1 message format or protocol.  HTTP's existing semantics
       remain unchanged.

BiDirectional or Server-Initiated HTTP (hybi)
---------------------------------------------

  "A Multiplexing Extension for WebSockets", John Tamplin, Takeshi
  Yoshino, 15-May-13, <draft-ietf-hybi-websocket-multiplexing-10.txt>

    The WebSocket Protocol [RFC6455] requires a new transport connection
       for every WebSocket connection.  This presents a scalability problem
       when many clients connect to the same server, and is made worse by
       having multiple clients running in different tabs of the same user
       agent.  This extension provides a way for separate logical WebSocket
       connections to share an underlying transport connection.
    
       Please send feedback to the hybi@ietf.org mailing list.

  "Compression Extensions for WebSocket", Takeshi Yoshino, 19-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-hybi-permessage-compression-10.txt>

    This document specifies a framework for creating WebSocket extensions
       that add compression functionality to the WebSocket Protocol.  An
       extension based on this framework compresses the payload data portion
       of non-control WebSocket messages on a per-message basis using
       parameters negotiated during the opening handshake.  This framework
       provides a general method to apply a compression algorithm to the
       contents of WebSocket messages.  For each compression algorithm, an
       extension is defined by specifying parameter negotiation and
       compression algorithm in detail.  This document also specifies one
       specific compression extension using the DEFLATE algorithm.
    
       Please send feedback to the hybi@ietf.org mailing list.

Inter-Domain Routing (idr)
--------------------------

  "BGP Link Bandwidth Extended Community", Pradosh Mohapatra, Rex
  Fernando, 21-Jan-13, <draft-ietf-idr-link-bandwidth-06.txt>

    This document describes an application of BGP extended communities
       that allows a router to perform unequal cost load balancing.

  "The Accumulated IGP Metric Attribute for BGP", Prodosh Mohapatra, Rex
  Fernando, Eric Rosen, James Uttaro, 23-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-idr-aigp-10.txt>

    Routing protocols that have been designed to run within a single
       administrative domain ("IGPs") generally do so by assigning a metric
       to each link, and then choosing as the installed path between two
       nodes the path for which the total distance (sum of the metric of
       each link along the path) is minimized.  BGP, designed to provide
       routing over a large number of independent administrative domains
       ("autonomous systems"), does not make its path selection decisions
       through the use of a metric.  It is generally recognized that any
       attempt to do so would incur significant scalability problems, as
       well as inter-administration coordination problems.  However, there
       are deployments in which a single administration runs several
       contiguous BGP networks.  In such cases, it can be desirable, within
       that single administrative domain, for BGP to select paths based on a
       metric, just as an IGP would do.  The purpose of this document is to
       provide a specification for doing so.

  "BGP Bestpath Selection Criteria Enhancement", Rajiv Asati, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp-bestpath-selection-criteria-06.txt>

    BGP specification [RFC4271] prescribes 'BGP next-hop reachability'
       as one of the key 'Route Resolvability Condition' that must be
       satisfied before the BGP bestpath candidate selection. This
       condition, however, may not be sufficient (as explained in the
       Appendix section) and desire further granularity.
    
       This document defines enhances the "Route Resolvability Condition"
       to facilitate the next-hop to be resolved in the chosen data plane.

  "Assigned BGP extended communities", Bruno Decraene, Pierre Francois,
  21-May-13, <draft-ietf-idr-reserved-extended-communities-05.txt>

    This document defines an IANA registry in order to assign non-
       transitive extended communities from.  These are similar to the
       existing well-known BGP communities defined in RFC 1997 but provide a
       control over inter-AS community advertisement as, per RFC RFC 4360,
       they are not transitive across Autonomous System boundaries.
    
       For that purpose, this document defines the use of the reserved
       Autonomous System number 0.65535 in the non-transitive generic four-
       octet AS specific extended community type.

  "BGP Optimal Route Reflection (BGP-ORR)", Robert Raszuk, Christian
  Cassar, Erik Aman, Bruno Decraene, Stephane Litkowski, 4-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp-optimal-route-reflection-05.txt>

    [RFC4456] asserts that, because the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
       cost to a given point in the network will vary across routers, "the
       route reflection approach may not yield the same route selection
       result as that of the full IBGP mesh approach."  One practical
       implication of this assertion is that the deployment of route
       reflection may thwart the ability to achieve hot potato routing.  Hot
       potato routing attempts to direct traffic to the closest AS egress
       point in cases where no higher priority policy dictates otherwise.
       As a consequence of the route reflection method, the choice of exit
       point for a route reflector and its clients will be the egress point
       closest to the route reflector - and not necessarily closest to the
       RR clients.
    
       Section 11 of [RFC4456] describes a deployment approach and a set of
       constraints which, if satsified, would result in the deployment of
       route reflection yielding the same results as the iBGP full mesh
       approach.  Such a deployment approach would make route reflection
       compatible with the application of hot potato routing policy.
    
       As networks evolved to accommodate architectural requirements of new
       services, tunneled (LSP/IP tunneling) networks with centralized route
       reflectors became commonplace.  This is one type of common deployment
       where it would be impractical to satisfy the constraints described in
       Section 11 of [RFC4456].  Yet, in such an environment, hot potato
       routing policy remains desirable.
    
       This document proposes two new solutions which can be deployed to
       facilitate the application of closest exit point policy centralized
       route reflection deployments.

  "Extended Message support for BGP", Keyur Patel, David Ward, Randy Bush,
  24-Dec-12, <draft-ietf-idr-bgp-extended-messages-05.txt>

    The BGP specification mandates a maximum BGP message size of 4096
       octets.  As BGP is extended to support newer AFI/SAFIs, there is a
       need to extend the maximum message size beyond 4096 octets.  This
       document updates [RFC4271] by providing an extension to BGP to extend
       its current message size from 4096 octets to 65535 octets.

  "BGP Custom Decision Process", Alvaro Retana, Russ White, 20-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-idr-custom-decision-03.txt>

    The BGP specification defines a Decision Process for installation of
       routes into the Loc-RIB.  This process takes into account an
       extensive series of path attributes, which can be manipulated to
       indicate preference for specific paths.  It is cumbersome (if at all
       possible) for the end user to define policies that will select, after
       partial comparison, a path based on subjective local (domain and/or
       node) criteria.
    
       This document defines a new Extended Community, called the Cost
       Community, which may be used in tie breaking during the best path
       selection process.  The end result is a local custom decision
       process.

  "Codification of AS 0 processing.", Warren Kumari, Randy Bush, Heather
  Schiller, Keyur Patel, 26-Aug-12, <draft-ietf-idr-as0-06.txt>

    This document updates RFC 4271 and proscribes the use of Autonomous
       System (AS) 0 in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) OPEN and AS_PATH /
       AS4_PATH BGP attribute.

  "Notification Message support for BGP Graceful Restart", Keyur Patel,
  Rex Fernando, John Scudder, Jeffrey Haas, 25-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp-gr-notification-01.txt>

    The current BGP Graceful Restart mechanism limits the usage of BGP
       Graceful Restart to BGP protocol messages other than a BGP
       NOTIFICATION message.  This document defines an extension to the BGP
       Graceful Restart that permits the Graceful Restart procedures to be
       performed when the BGP speaker receives a BGP NOTIFICATION Message.
       This document also defines a new BGP NOTIFICATION Cease Error subcode
       to prevent BGP speakers supporting the extension defined in this
       document from performing a Graceful Restart.

  "Automatic Route Target Filtering for legacy PEs", Pradosh Mohapatra,
  Arjun Sreekantiah, Keyur Patel, Burjiz Pithawala, Alton Lo, 13-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-idr-legacy-rtc-01.txt>

    This document describes a simple procedure that allows "legacy" BGP
       speakers to exchange route target membership information in BGP
       without using mechanisms specified in [RFC4684].  The intention of
       the proposed technique is to help in partial deployment scenarios and
       is not meant to replace [RFC4684].

  "Internet Exchange Route Server", Elisa Jasinska, Nick Hilliard, Robert
  Raszuk, Niels Bakker, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server-02.txt>

    This document outlines a specification for multilateral
       interconnections at Internet exchange points (IXPs).  Multilateral
       interconnection is a method of exchanging routing information between
       three or more exterior BGP speakers using a single intermediate
       broker system, referred to as a route server.  Route servers are
       typically used on shared access media networks, such as Internet
       exchange points (IXPs), to facilitate simplified interconnection
       between multiple Internet routers.

  "Making Route Flap Damping Usable", Cristel Pelsser, Randy Bush, Keyur
  Patel, Pradosh Mohapatra, Olaf Maennel, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-idr-rfd-usable-02.txt>

    Route Flap Damping (RFD) was first proposed to reduce BGP churn in
       routers.  Unfortunately, RFD was found to severely penalize sites for
       being well-connected because topological richness amplifies the
       number of update messages exchanged.  Many operators have turned RFD
       off.  Based on experimental measurement, this document recommends
       adjusting a few RFD algorithmic constants and limits, to reduce the
       high risks with RFD, with the result being damping a non-trivial
       amount of long term churn without penalizing well-behaved prefixes'
       normal convergence process.

  "Revised Validation Procedure for BGP Flow Specifications", James
  Uttaro, Clarence Filsfils, Pradosh Mohapatra, David Smith, 22-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp-flowspec-oid-01.txt>

    This document describes a modification to the validation procedure
       defined in RFC 5575 for the dissemination of BGP flow specifications.
       RFC 5575 requires that the originator of the flow specification
       matches the originator of the best-match unicast route for the
       destination prefix embedded in the flow specification. This allows
       only BGP speakers within the data forwarding path (such as autonomous
       system border routers) to originate BGP flow specifications.  Though
       it is possible to disseminate such flow specifications directly from
       border routers, it may be operationally cumbersome in an autonomous
       system with a large number of border routers having complex BGP
       policies. The modification proposed herein enables flow
       specifications to be originated from a centralized BGP route
       controller.

  "North-Bound Distribution of Link-State and TE Information using BGP",
  Hannes Gredler, Jan Medved, Stefano Previdi, Adrian Farrel, Saikat Ray,
  21-May-13, <draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution-03.txt>

    In a number of environments, a component external to a network is
       called upon to perform computations based on the network topology and
       current state of the connections within the network, including
       traffic engineering information.  This is information typically
       distributed by IGP routing protocols within the network
    
       This document describes a mechanism by which links state and traffic
       engineering information can be collected from networks and shared
       with external components using the BGP routing protocol.  This is
       achieved using a new BGP Network Layer Reachability Information
       (NLRI) encoding format.  The mechanism is applicable to physical and
       virtual IGP links.  The mechanism described is subject to policy
       control.
    
       Applications of this technique include Application Layer Traffic
       Optimization (ALTO) servers, and Path Computation Elements (PCEs).

  "Autonomous System (AS) Reservation for Private Use", Jon Mitchell,
  29-May-13, <draft-ietf-idr-as-private-reservation-05.txt>

    This document describes the reservation of Autonomous System numbers
       (ASNs) that are for Private Use only and MUST NOT be advertised to
       the Internet, known as Private Use ASNs.  This document enlarges the
       total space available for Private Use ASNs by documenting the
       reservation of a second, larger range and updates RFC 1930 by
       replacing Section 10.

  "Inter-domain SLA Exchange", Shitanshu Shah, Keyur Patel, Sandeep Bajaj,
  Luis Tomotaki, Mohamed Boucadair, 3-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-idr-sla-exchange-00.txt>

    Network administrators typically provision QoS policies for their
       application traffic (such as voice, video) based on SLAs negotiated
       with their providers, and translate those SLAs to vendor specific
       configuration language.  Both learning of SLA, either thru SLA
       documents or via some other out-of-band method, and translating them
       to vendor specific configuration language is a complex, many times
       manual, process and prone to errors.  This document proposes an in-
       band method of SLA signaling which can help to simplify some of the
       complexities.
    
       This document defines an operational transitive attribute to signal
       SLA details in-band, across administrative boundaries (considered as
       Autonomous Systems (AS)), and thus simplify/speed-up some of the
       complex tasks.
    
       Though the use-case with the proposed attribute is explicitly defined
       in this document, purpose of this attribute is not limited to this
       use-case only.

INtermediary-safe SIP session ID (insipid)
------------------------------------------

  "Requirements for an End-to-End Session Identification in IP-Based
  Multimedia Communication Networks", Paul Jones, Gonzalo Salgueiro, James
  Polk, Laura Liess, Hadriel Kaplan, 12-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-insipid-session-id-reqts-07.txt>

    This document specifies the requirements for an end-to-end session
       identifier in IP-based multimedia communication networks.  This
       identifier would enable endpoints, intermediate devices, and
       management and monitoring systems to identify a session end-to-end
       across multiple SIP devices, hops, and administrative domains.

  "End-to-End Session Identification in IP-Based Multimedia Communication
  Networks", Paul Jones, Chris Pearce, James Polk, Gonzalo Salgueiro,
  12-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-insipid-session-id-00.txt>

    This document describes an end-to-end Session Identifier for use in
       IP-based Multimedia Communication systems that enables endpoints,
       intermediate devices, and management systems to identify a session
       end-to-end, associate multiple endpoints with a given multipoint
       conference, track communication sessions when they are redirected,
       and associate one or more media flows with a given communication
       session.

Internet Area (int)
-------------------

  "Mesh Link Establishment", Richard Kelsey, 21-Feb-13,
  <draft-kelsey-intarea-mesh-link-establishment-05.txt>

    This document defines the mesh link establishment (MLE) protocol for
       establishing and configuring secure radio links in IEEE 802.15.4
       radio mesh networks.  MLE extends IEEE 802.15.4 for use in multihop
       mesh networks by adding three capabilities: 1) dynamically
       configuring and securing radio links, 2) enabling network-wide
       changes to radio parameters, and 3) detecting neighboring devices.
       MLE operates below the routing layer, insulating it from the details
       of configuring, securing, and maintaining individual radio links
       within a larger mesh network.

Internet Area Working Group (intarea)
-------------------------------------

  "Using the IPv6 Flow Label for Server Load Balancing", Brian Carpenter,
  Sheng Jiang, Willy Tarreau, 25-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-intarea-flow-label-balancing-01.txt>

    This document describes how the IPv6 flow label as currently
       specified can be used to enhance layer 3/4 load distribution and
       balancing for large server farms.

IP Flow Information Export (ipfix)
----------------------------------

  "Flow Selection Techniques", Salvatore D'Antonio, Tanja Zseby, Christian
  Henke, Lorenzo Peluso, 30-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-flow-selection-tech-18.txt>

    Intermediate Flow Selection Process is the process of selecting a
       subset of Flows from all observed Flows.  The Intermediate Flow
       Selection Process may be located at an IPFIX Exporter, Collector, or
       within an IPFIX Mediator.  It reduces the effort of post-processing
       Flow data and transferring Flow Records.  This document describes
       motivations for using the Intermediate Flow Selection process and
       presents Intermediate Flow Selection techniques.  It provides an
       information model for configuring Intermediate Flow Selection Process
       techniques and discusses what information about an Intermediate Flow
       Selection Process should be exported.

  "Flow Aggregation for the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol",
  Brian Trammell, Arno Wagner, Benoit Claise, 19-Nov-12,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-a9n-08.txt>

    This document provides a common implementation-independent basis for
       the interoperable application of the IP Flow Information Export
       (IPFIX) Protocol to the handling of Aggregated Flows, which are IPFIX
       Flows representing packets from multiple Original Flows sharing some
       set of common properties.  It does this through a detailed
       terminology and a descriptive Intermediate Aggregation Process
       architecture, including a specification of methods for Original Flow
       counting and counter distribution across intervals.

  "Guidelines for Authors and Reviewers of IPFIX Information Elements",
  Brian Trammell, Benoit Claise, 3-Oct-12,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-ie-doctors-07.txt>

    This document provides guidelines for how to write definitions of new
       Information Elements for the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
       protocol.  It provides instructions on using the proper conventions
       for Information Elements to be registered in the IANA IPFIX
       Information Element registry, and provides guidelines for expert
       reviewers to evaluate new registrations.

  "Specification of the IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX) Protocol for
  the Exchange of Flow Information", Benoit Claise, Brian Trammell,
  13-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-ipfix-protocol-rfc5101bis-08.txt>

    This document specifies the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
       protocol that serves for transmitting Traffic Flow information over
       the network. In order to transmit Traffic Flow information from an
       Exporting Process to a Collecting Process, a common representation of
       flow data and a standard means of communicating them is required.
       This document describes how the IPFIX Data and Template Records are
       carried over a number of transport protocols from an IPFIX Exporting
       Process to an IPFIX Collecting Process. This document obsoletes RFC
       5101.

  "Operation of the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol on IPFIX
  Mediators", Benoit Claise, Atsushi Kobayashi, Brian Trammell, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-mediation-protocol-04.txt>

    This document specifies the operation of the IP Flow Information
       Export (IPFIX) protocol specific to IPFIX Mediators, including
       Template and Observation Point management, timing considerations, and
       other Mediator-specific concerns.

  "Information Model for IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX)", Benoit
  Claise, Brian Trammell, 12-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-information-model-rfc5102bis-10.txt>

    This document defines the datatypes and management policy for the
       information model for the IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX)
       protocol. This information model is maintained as the IANA IPFIX
       Information Element Registry, the initial contents of which were
       defined by RFC 5102. This information model is used by the IPFIX
       Protocol for encoding measured traffic information and information
       related to the traffic Observation Point, the traffic Metering
       Process, and the Exporting Process. Although developed for the IPFIX
       Protocol, the model is defined in an open way that easily allows
       using it in other protocols, interfaces, and applications. This
       document obsoletes RFC 5102.

  "Information Elements for Data Link Layer Traffic Measurement", Shingo
  Kashima, Atsushi Kobayashi, Paul Aitken, 22-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-data-link-layer-monitoring-02.txt>

    This document describes Information Elements related to data link
       layer.  They are used by the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
       protocol for encoding measured data link layer traffic information.

  "Exporting MIB Variables using the IPFIX Protocol", Benoit Claise, Paul
  Aitken, Juergen Schoenwaelder, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-mib-variable-export-02.txt>

    This document specifies a way to complement IPFIX Flow Records with
       Management Information Base (MIB) objects, avoiding the need to
       define new IPFIX Information Elements for existing Management
       Information Base objects that are already fully specified.
    
       This method requires an extension to the current IPFIX protocol.  New
       Template Set and Options Template Sets are specified to allow the
       export of Extended Field Specifiers, which may represent IPFIX
       Information Elements and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
       MIB Objects.

IP Performance Metrics (ippm)
-----------------------------

  "Rate Measurement Test Protocol Problem Statement", Al Morton,
  23-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-ippm-rate-problem-03.txt>

    This memo presents an access rate-measurement problem statement for
       test protocols to measure IP Performance Metrics.  The rate
       measurement scenario has wide-spread attention of Internet access
       subscribers and seemingly all industry players, including regulators.
       Key test protocol aspects require the ability to control packet size
       on the tested path and enable asymmetrical packet size testing in a
       controller-responder architecture.

  "Test Plan and Results for Advancing RFC 2680 on the Standards Track",
  Len Ciavattone, Ruediger Geib, Al Morton, Matthias Wieser, 17-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-ippm-testplan-rfc2680-02.txt>

    This memo proposes to advance a performance metric RFC along the
       standards track, specifically RFC 2680 on One-way Loss Metrics.
       Observing that the metric definitions themselves should be the
       primary focus rather than the implementations of metrics, this memo
       describes the test procedures to evaluate specific metric requirement
       clauses to determine if the requirement has been interpreted and
       implemented as intended.  Two completely independent implementations
       have been tested against the key specifications of RFC 2680.
    
       In this version, the results are presented in the R-tool output form.
       Beautification is future work.

  "Model Based Bulk Performance Metrics", Matt Mathis, Al Morton,
  21-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics-00.txt>

    We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to determine
       if a long path can meet predefined end-to-end application performance
       targets.  This is done by subpath at a time testing -- by applying a
       suite of single property tests to successive subpaths of a long path.
       In many cases these single property tests are based on existing IPPM
       metrics, with the addition of success and validity criteria.  The
       subpath at a time tests are designed to facilitate IP providers
       eliminating all known conditions that might prevent the full end-to-
       end path from meeting the users target performance.
    
       This approach makes it possible to to determine the IP performance
       requirements needed to support the desired end-to-end TCP
       performance.  The IP metrics are based on traffic patterns that mimic
       TCP but are precomputed independently of the actual behavior of TCP
       over the subpath under test.  This makes the measurements open loop,
       eliminating nearly all of the difficulties encountered by traditional
       bulk transport metrics, which rely on congestion control equilibrium
       behavior.
    
       A natural consequence of this methodology is verifiable network
       measurement: measurements from any given vantage point are repeatable
       from other vantage points.

IP Security Maintenance and Extensions (ipsecme)
------------------------------------------------

  "Auto Discovery VPN Problem Statement and Requirements", Stephen Hanna,
  Vishwas Manral, 6-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-ipsecme-ad-vpn-problem-07.txt>

    This document describes the problem of enabling a large number of
       systems to communicate directly using IPsec to protect the traffic
       between them.  It then expands on the requirements, for such a
       solution.
    
       Manual configuration of all possible tunnels is too cumbersome in
       many such cases.  In other cases the IP address of endpoints change
       or the endpoints may be behind NAT gateways, making static
       configuration impossible.  The Auto Discovery VPN solution will
       address these requirements.

  "Additional Diffie-Hellman Tests for IKEv2", Yaron Sheffer, Scott
  Fluhrer, 4-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-ipsecme-dh-checks-05.txt>

    This document adds a small number of mandatory tests required for the
       secure operation of IKEv2 with elliptic curve groups.  No change is
       required to IKE implementations that use modular exponential groups,
       other than a few rarely used so-called DSA groups.  This document
       updates the IKEv2 protocol, RFC 5996.

  "Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance
  for Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header
  (AH)", David McGrew, Wajdi Feghali, 12-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-ipsecme-esp-ah-reqts-00.txt>

    This Internet Draft is standards track proposal to update to the
       Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for ESP and AH;
       it also adds usage guidance to help in the selection of these
       algorithms.
    
       The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header
       (AH) protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms to
       provide confidentiality and/or data origin authentication to
       protected data communications in the IP Security (IPsec)
       architecture.  To ensure interoperability between disparate
       implementations, the IPsec standard specifies a set of mandatory-to-
       implement algorithms.  This document specifies the current set of
       mandatory-to-implement algorithms for ESP and AH, specifies
       algorithms that should be implemented because they may be promoted to
       mandatory at some future time, and also recommends against the
       implementation of some obsolete algorithms.  Usage guidance is also
       provided to help the user of ESP and AH best achieve their security
       goals through appropriate choices of cryptographic algorithms.

  "More Raw Public Keys for IKEv2", Tero Kivinen, Paul Wouters, Hannes
  Tschofenig, 8-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-ipsecme-oob-pubkey-00.txt>

    The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol currently only
       supports raw RSA keys.  In some environments it is useful to make use
       of other types of public keys, such as those based on Elliptic Curve
       Cryptography.  This documents adds support for other types of raw
       public keys to IKEv2 and obsoletes the old raw RSA key format.

IS-IS for IP Internets (isis)
-----------------------------

  "IS-IS Operational Enhancements for Network Maintenance Events", Naiming
  Shen, Tony Li, Shane Amante, Mikael Abrahamsson, 14-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-isis-oper-enhance-03.txt>

    This document describes an improved IS-IS neighbor management scheme
       which can be used to enhance operational experience in terms of
       convergence speed and finer control of neighbor cost over a LAN.

  "IS-IS Reverse Metric TLV for Network Maintenance Events", Naiming Shen,
  Tony Li, Shane Amante, Mikael Abrahamsson, 14-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-isis-reverse-metric-03.txt>

    This document describes an improved IS-IS neighbor management scheme
       which can be used to enhance network performance by allowing
       operators to quickly and accurately shift traffic away from a point-
       to-point or multi-access LAN interface by allowing one IS-IS router
       to signal to a second, adjacent IS-IS neighbor to adjust its IS-IS
       metric that should be used to temporarily reach the first IS-IS
       router during network maintenance events.

  "Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Use of IS-IS",
  Donald Eastlake, Tissa Senevirathne, Anoop Ghanwani, Dinesh Dutt, Ayan
  Banerjee, 9-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-isis-rfc6326bis-01.txt>

    The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
       protocol provides optimal pair-wise data frame forwarding without
       configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology and link
       technology, and support for multipathing of both unicast and
       multicast traffic. This document specifies the data formats and code
       points for the IS-IS extensions to support TRILL. These data formats
       and code points may also be used by technologies other than TRILL.
       This document obsoletes RFC 6326.

  "IS-IS Extended Sequence number TLV", Uma Chunduri, Wenhu Lu, Albert
  Tian, Naiming Shen, 10-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-isis-extended-sequence-no-tlv-00.txt>

    This document defines Extended Sequence number TLV to protect
       Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) PDUs from replay
       attacks.

  "IS-IS Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions", Stefano Previdi,
  Spencer Giacalone, David Ward, John Drake, Alia Atlas, Clarence
  Filsfils, 17-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-isis-te-metric-extensions-00.txt>

    In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
       information networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network
       performance criteria (e.g. latency) are becoming as critical to data
       path selection as other metrics.
    
       This document describes extensions to IS-IS TE [RFC5305] such that
       network performance information can be distributed and collected in a
       scalable fashion.  The information distributed using ISIS TE Metric
       Extensions can then be used to make path selection decisions based on
       network performance.
    
       Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which network
       performance information is distributed.  The mechanisms for measuring
       network performance or acting on that information, once distributed,
       are outside the scope of this document.

JSON data formats for vCard and iCalendar (jcardcal)
----------------------------------------------------

  "jCal: The JSON format for iCalendar", Philipp Kewisch, Cyrus Daboo,
  Mike Douglass, 10-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-jcardcal-jcal-04.txt>

    This specification defines "jCal", a JSON format for iCalendar data.

  "jCard: The JSON format for vCard", Philipp Kewisch, 18-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-jcardcal-jcard-03.txt>

    This specification defines "jCard", a JSON format for vCard data.

Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (jose)
-----------------------------------------------

  "JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)", Michael Jones, 28-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-jose-json-web-algorithms-11.txt,.pdf>

    The JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) specification enumerates cryptographic
       algorithms and identifiers to be used with the JSON Web Signature
       (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), and JSON Web Key (JWK)
       specifications.

  "JSON Web Encryption (JWE)", Michael Jones, Eric Rescorla, Joe
  Hildebrand, 28-May-13, <draft-ietf-jose-json-web-encryption-11.txt,.pdf>

    JSON Web Encryption (JWE) is a means of representing encrypted
       content using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) based data
       structures.  Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with
       this specification are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms
       (JWA) specification.  Related digital signature and MAC capabilities
       are described in the separate JSON Web Signature (JWS) specification.

  "JSON Web Key (JWK)", Michael Jones, 28-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-jose-json-web-key-11.txt,.pdf>

    A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data
       structure that represents a cryptographic key.  This specification
       also defines a JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) JSON data structure for
       representing a set of JWKs.  Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers
       for use with this specification are described in the separate JSON
       Web Algorithms (JWA) specification.

  "JSON Web Signature (JWS)", Michael Jones, John Bradley, Nat Sakimura,
  28-May-13, <draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-11.txt,.pdf>

    JSON Web Signature (JWS) is a means of representing content secured
       with digital signatures or Message Authentication Codes (MACs) using
       JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) based data structures.
       Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with this
       specification are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)
       specification.  Related encryption capabilities are described in the
       separate JSON Web Encryption (JWE) specification.

  "Use Cases and Requirements for JSON Object Signing and Encryption
  (JOSE)", Richard Barnes, 29-May-13, <draft-ietf-jose-use-cases-02.txt>

    Many Internet applications have a need for object-based security
       mechanisms in addition to security mechanisms at the network layer or
       transport layer.  In the past, the Cryptographic Message Syntax has
       provided a binary secure object format based on ASN.1.  Over time,
       the use of binary object encodings such as ASN.1 has been overtaken
       by text-based encodings, for example JavaScript Object Notation.
       This document defines a set of use cases and requirements for a
       secure object format encoded using JavaScript Object Notation, drawn
       from a variety of application security mechanisms currently in
       development.

JavaScript Object Notation (json)
---------------------------------

  "The application/json Media Type for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)",
  Douglas Crockford, 6-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-json-rfc4627bis-02.txt>

    JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, text-based,
       language-independent data interchange format.  It was derived from
       the ECMAScript Programming Language Standard.  JSON defines a small
       set of formatting rules for the portable representation of structured
       data.

Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols (karp)
------------------------------------------------------

  "Database of Long-Lived Symmetric Cryptographic Keys", Russ Housley, Tim
  Polk, Sam Hartman, Dacheng Zhang, 12-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-karp-crypto-key-table-07.txt>

    This document specifies the information contained in a conceptual
       database of long-lived cryptographic keys used by many different
       security protocols.  The database is designed to support both manual
       and automated key management.  In addition to describing the schema
       for the database, this document describes the operations that can be
       performed on the database as well as the requirements for the
       security protocols that wish to use the database.  In many typical
       scenarios, the security protocols do not directly use the long-lived
       key, but rather a key derivation function is used to derive a short-
       lived key from a long-lived key.

  "Operations Model for Router Keying", Sam Hartman, Dacheng Zhang,
  20-May-13, <draft-ietf-karp-ops-model-06.txt>

    Developing an operational and management model for routing protocol
       security that works across protocols will be critical to the success
       of routing protocol security efforts.  This document discusses issues
       and begins to consider development of these models.

  "Analysis of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) Security According
  to KARP Design Guide", Manav Bhatia, Dacheng Zhang, Mahesh Jethanandani,
  11-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-karp-bfd-analysis-00.txt>

    This document analyzes the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
       protocol (BFD) according to the guidelines set forth in section 4.2
       of KARP Design Guidelines [RFC6518].

  "KARP IS-IS security analysis", Uma Chunduri, Albert Tian, Wenhu Lu,
  11-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-karp-isis-analysis-00.txt>

    This document analyzes the threats applicable for Intermediate system
       to Intermediate system (IS-IS) routing protocol and security gaps
       according to the KARP Design Guide.  This document also provides
       specific requirements to address the gaps with both manual and auto
       key management protocols.

Common Authentication Technology Next Generation (kitten)
---------------------------------------------------------

  "SAML Enhanced Client SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms", Scott Cantor, Simon
  Josefsson, 13-May-13, <draft-ietf-kitten-sasl-saml-ec-09.txt>

    Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 is a generalized
       framework for the exchange of security-related information between
       asserting and relying parties.  Simple Authentication and Security
       Layer (SASL) and the Generic Security Service Application Program
       Interface (GSS-API) are application frameworks to facilitate an
       extensible authentication model.  This document specifies a SASL and
       GSS-API mechanism for SAML 2.0 that leverages the capabilities of a
       SAML-aware "enhanced client" to address significant barriers to
       federated authentication in a manner that encourages reuse of
       existing SAML bindings and profiles designed for non-browser
       scenarios.

  "A set of SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms for OAuth", William Mills, Tim
  Showalter, Hannes Tschofenig, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-kitten-sasl-oauth-10.txt>

    OAuth enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to a
       protected resource, either on behalf of a resource owner by
       orchestrating an approval interaction, or by allowing the third-party
       application to obtain access on its own behalf.
    
       This document defines how an application client uses credentials
       obtained via OAuth over the Simple Authentication and Security Layer
       (SASL) or the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface
       (GSS-API) to access a protected resource at a resource serve.
       Thereby, it enables schemes defined within the OAuth framework for
       non-HTTP-based application protocols.
    
       Clients typically store the user's long-term credential.  This does,
       however, lead to significant security vulnerabilities, for example,
       when such a credential leaks.  A significant benefit of OAuth for
       usage in those clients is that the password is replaced by a token.
       Tokens typically provided limited access rights and can be managed
       and revoked separately from the user's long-term credential
       (password).

  "Kerberos Authorization Data Container Authenticated by Multiple MACs",
  Simo Sorce, Tom Yu, Thomas Hardjono, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-krb-wg-cammac-04.txt>

    Abstract: This document specifies a Kerberos Authorization Data
    container that supersedes AD-KDC-ISSUED.  It allows for multiple
    Message Authentication Codes (MACs) or signatures to authenticate the
    contained Authorization Data elements.

  "Move Kerberos protocol parameter registries to IANA", Tom Yu,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-kitten-kerberos-iana-registries-01.txt>

    The Keberos 5 network authentication protocol has several numeric
       protocol parameters.  Most of these parameters are not currently

       the maintenance of the remainder of these Kerberos parameters.

  "Initial and Pass Through Authentication Using Kerberos V5 and the GSS-
  API (IAKERB)", Jim Schaad, Larry Zhu, Jeffrey Altman, 10-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-kitten-iakerb-00.txt>

    This document defines extensions to the Kerberos protocol and the
       GSS-API Kerberos mechanism that enable a GSS-API Kerberos client to
       exchange messages with the KDC using the GSS-API acceptor as the
       proxy, by encapsulating the Kerberos messages inside GSS-API tokens.
       With these extensions a client can obtain Kerberos tickets for
       services where the KDC is not accessible to the client, but is
       accessible to the application server.

  "AES Encryption with HMAC-SHA2 for Kerberos 5", Kelley Burgin, Michael
  Peck, 19-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-kitten-aes-cts-hmac-sha2-00.txt>

    This document specifies two encryption types and two corresponding
       checksum types for Kerberos 5.  The new types use AES in CTS mode
       (CBC mode with ciphertext stealing) for confidentiality and HMAC with
       a SHA-2 hash for integrity.

Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (l2vpn)
----------------------------------------

  "Multicast in VPLS", Rahul Aggarwal, Yakov Rekhter, Yuji Kamite, Luyuan
  Fang, 30-Jan-13, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast-13.txt>

    This document describes a solution for overcoming a subset of the
       limitations of existing VPLS multicast solutions. It describes
       procedures for VPLS multicast that utilize multicast trees in the
       sevice provider (SP) network.  One such multicast tree can be shared
       between multiple VPLS instances.  Procedures by which a single
       multicast tree in the SP network can be used to carry traffic
       belonging only to a specified set of one or more IP multicast streams
       from one or more VPLSes are also described.

  "PIM Snooping over VPLS", Olivier Dornon, Jayant Kotalwar, Jeffrey
  Zhang, Venu Hemige, Ray Qiu, 15-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-pim-snooping-03.txt>

    In Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), as also in IEEE Bridged
       Networks, the switches simply flood multicast traffic on all ports in
       the LAN by default.  IGMP Snooping is commonly deployed to ensure
       multicast traffic is not forwarded on ports without IGMP receivers.
       The procedures and recommendations for IGMP Snooping are defined in
       [IGMP-SNOOP].  But when any protocol other than IGMP is used, the
       common practice is to simply flood multicast traffic to all ports.
       PIM-SM, PIM-SSM, PIM-BIDIR are widely deployed routing protocols.
       PIM Snooping procedures are important to restrict multicast traffic
       to only the routers interested in receiving such traffic.
    
       While most of the PIM Snooping procedures defined here also apply to
       IEEE Bridged Networks, VPLS demands certain special procedures due to
       the split-horizon rules that require the Provider Edge (PE) devices
       to co-operate.  This document describes the procedures and
       recommendations for PIM-Snooping in VPLS to facilitate replication to
       only those ports behind which there are interested PIM routers and/or
       IGMP hosts.  This document also describes procedures for PIM Proxy.
       PIM Proxy is required on PEs for VPLS Multicast to work correctly
       when Join suppression is enabled in the VPLS.  PIM Proxy also helps
       scale VPLS Multicast much better than just PIM Snooping.

  "Virtual Private Lan Services (VPLS) Management Information Base",
  Thomas Nadeau, Kiran Koushik, Rohit Mediratta, 14-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mib-10.txt>

    This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
       Information Base for use with network management protocols in the
       Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects for
       modeling of Virtual Private LAN services. It needs to be used in
       conjunction with Pseudowire (PW) Management Information Base
       [RFC5601].

  "LDP Extensions for Optimized MAC Address Withdrawal in H-VPLS", Pranjal
  Dutta, Florin Balus, Olen Stokes, Geraldine Calvignac, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-ldp-mac-opt-08.txt>

    [RFC4762] describes a mechanism to remove or unlearn MAC addresses
       that have been dynamically learned in a VPLS Instance for faster
       convergence on topology change.  The procedure also removes MAC
       addresses in the VPLS that do not require relearning due to such
       topology change.  This document defines an enhancement to the MAC
       Address Withdrawal procedure with empty MAC List [RFC4762], which
       enables a Provider Edge(PE) device to remove only the MAC addresses
       that need to be relearned.  Additional extensions to [RFC4762] MAC
       Withdrawal procedures are specified to provide optimized MAC flushing
       for the PBB-VPLS specified in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-pbb-vpls-pe-model] .

  "Extensions to VPLS PE model for Provider Backbone Bridging", Florin
  Balus, Ali Sajassi, Nabil Bitar, 13-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-pbb-vpls-pe-model-07.txt>

    IEEE 802.1 Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB) [IEEE.802.1Q-2011] defines
       an architecture and bridge protocols for interconnection of multiple
       Provider Bridge Networks (PBNs). PBB was defined in IEEE as a
       connectionless technology based on multipoint VLAN tunnels.  PBB can
       be used to attain better scalability in terms of number of customer
       MAC addresses and number of service instances that can be supported.
    
       Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [RFC4664] provides a framework for
       extending Ethernet LAN services, using MPLS tunneling capabilities,
       through a routed MPLS backbone without running RSTP or MSTP across
       the backbone. As a result, VPLS has been deployed on a large scale in
       service provider networks.
    
       This draft discusses extensions to the VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model
       required to incorporate desirable PBB components while maintaining
       the Service Provider fit of the initial model.

  "BGP based Multi-homing in Virtual Private LAN Service", Bhupesh
  Kothari, Kireeti Kompella, Wim Henderickx, Florin Balus, James Uttaro,
  Senad Palislamovic, Wen Lin, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-multihoming-05.txt>

    Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a Layer 2 Virtual Private
       Network (VPN) that gives its customers the appearance that their
       sites are connected via a Local Area Network (LAN).  It is often
       required for the Service Provider (SP) to give the customer redundant
       connectivity to some sites, often called "multi-homing".  This memo
       shows how BGP-based multi-homing can be offered in the context of LDP
       and BGP VPLS solutions.

  "MAC Flush Loop Detection in VPLS", Paul Kwok, Pranjal Dutta, 31-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-macflush-ld-03.txt>

    MAC Address Withdrawal is a mechanism described in [RFC4762] to
       remove or unlearn MAC addresses that have been dynamically learned in
       a VPLS instance, for faster convergence on topology change.  Failure
       of mechanisms that control loop free connectivity among VPLS PE-rs
       nodes may cause MAC Address Withdrawal messages looping among those
       nodes, leading to Denial of Service (DoS) or complete failure of
       control plane in the PE-rs nodes.  This document describes a
       mechanism to detect and prevent loops of MAC Address Withdrawal
       messages in a VPLS PE-rs node on such failures.

  "Extension to LDP-VPLS for Ethernet Broadcast and Multicast", Frederic

  Lizhong Jin, 22-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-ldp-vpls-broadcast-exten-05.txt>

    This document proposes a simple extension to LDP-VPLS to improve
       bandwidth efficiency for Ethernet broadcast/multicast traffic
       within a carrier's network. It makes use of unidirectional
       point-to-multipoint PseudoWires to minimise payload frame duplication
       on physical links.

    This document provides functional requirements for Metro Ethernet
       Forum (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) support in multipoint L2VPN
       solutions (referred to as simply L2VPN). It is intended that
       potential solutions will use these requirements as guidelines.

  Frederic JOUNAY, Lucy Yong, Lizhong Jin, Yuji Kamite, Wim Henderickx,
  22-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-etree-frwk-02.txt>

    This document proposes a solution framework for supporting Metro
       Ethernet Forum (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) services over a
       Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network. The objective is to
       provide a simple and effective approach to emulate E-Tree services
       in addition to Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) services on an existing MPLS
       network.

  Isaac, Lizhong Jin, 25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-pbb-evpn-04.txt>

    This document discusses how Ethernet Provider Backbone Bridging
       [802.1ah] can be combined with E-VPN in order to reduce the number of
       BGP MAC advertisement routes by aggregating Customer/Client MAC (C-
       MAC) addresses via Provider Backbone MAC address (B-MAC), provide
       client MAC address mobility using C-MAC aggregation and B-MAC sub-
       netting, confine the scope of C-MAC learning to only active flows,
       offer per site policies and avoid C-MAC address flushing on topology
       changes. The combined solution is referred to as PBB-EVPN.

  "Requirements for Ethernet VPN (E-VPN)", Ali Sajassi, Rahul Aggarwal,
  Nabil Bitar, Aldrin Isaac, 30-May-13, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-evpn-req-03.txt>

    The widespread adoption of Ethernet L2VPN services and the advent of
       new applications for the technology (e.g., data center interconnect)
       have culminated in a new set of requirements that are not readily
       addressable by the current Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)
       solution. In particular, multi-homing with all-active forwarding is
       not supported and there's no existing solution to leverage
       Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs for optimizing the delivery of
       multi-destination frames. Furthermore, the provisioning of VPLS, even
       in the context of BGP-based auto-discovery, requires network
       operators to specify various network parameters on top of the access
       configuration. This document specifies the requirements for an
       Ethernet VPN (E-VPN) solution which addresses the above issues.

  "VPLS PE Model for E-Tree Support", Yuanlong Jiang, Lucy Yong, Manuel
  Paul, Frederic JOUNAY, Florin Balus, Wim Henderickx, Ali Sajassi,
  6-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-pe-etree-01.txt>

    A generic VPLS solution for E-Tree services is proposed which uses
       VLANs to indicate root/leaf traffic. A VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model
       is illustrated as an example for the solution. In the solution, E-
       Tree VPLS PEs are interconnected by PWs which carry the VLAN
       indicating the E-Tree attribute, the MAC address based Ethernet
       forwarding engine and the PW work in the same way as before. A
       signaling mechanism for E-Tree capability and VLAN mapping
       negotiation is further described.

----------------------------------------

  "BGP ACCEPT_OWN Community Attribute", James Uttaro, Pradosh Mohapatra,
  David Smith, Robert Raszuk, John Scudder, 21-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-l3vpn-acceptown-community-06.txt>

    Under certain conditions it is desirable for a BGP route reflector to
       be able to modify the Route Target list of a VPN route that is
       distributed by the route reflector, enabling the route reflector to
       control how a route originated within one VRF is imported into other
       VRFs.  This technique works effectively as long as the VRF that
       exports the route is not on the same PE as the VRF(s) that import the
       route.  However, due to the constraints of the BGP protocol, it does
       not work if the two are on the same PE.  This document describes a
       modification to the BGP protocol allowing this technique to work when
       the VRFs are on the same PE, allowing the technique to be used in a
       standard manner throughout an autonomous system.

  "MVPN: Using Bidirectional P-Tunnels", Eric Rosen, IJsbrand Wijnands,
  Yiqun Cai, Arjen Boers, 10-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-bidir-05.txt>

    A set of prior RFCs specify procedures for supporting multicast in
       BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  These procedures allow customer multicast data to
       travel across a service provider's backbone network through a set of
       multicast tunnels.  The tunnels are advertised in certain BGP "auto-
       discovery" routes, by means of a BGP attribute known as the "Provider
       Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) Tunnel attribute".  Encodings have
       been defined that allow the PMSI Tunnel attribute to identify
       bidirectional (multipoint-to-multipoint) multicast distribution
       trees.  However, the prior RFCs do not provide all the necessary
       procedures for using bidirectional tunnels to support multicast VPNs.
       This document updates RFCs 6513 and 6625 by specifying those
       procedures.  In particular, it specifies the procedures for assigning
       customer multicast flows (unidirectional or bidirectional) to
       specific bidirectional tunnels in the provider backbone, for
       advertising such assignments, and for determining which flows have
       been assigned to which tunnels.

  "Virtual Hub-and-Spoke in BGP/MPLS VPNs", Huajin Jeng, James Uttaro,
  Luay Jalil, Bruno Decraene, Yakov Rekhter, Rahul Aggarwal, 19-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-l3vpn-virtual-hub-06.txt>

    With BGP/MPLS VPNs, providing any-to-any connectivity among sites of
       a given Virtual Private Network would require each Provider Edge
       router that has one or more of these sites connected to it to hold
       all the routes of that Virtual Private Network. The approach
       described in this document allows to reduce the number of Provider
       Edge routers that have to maintain all these routes by requiring only
       a subset of these routers to maintain all these routes.
    
       Furthermore, when Provider Edge routers use ingress replication to
       carry multicast traffic of VPN customers, the approach described in
       this document may under certain circumstances allow to reduce
       bandwidth inefficiency associated with ingress replication, and to
       redistribute the replication load among Provider Edge routers.

    This document describes a solution in which the control plane
       protocol specified in BGP/MPLS IP VPNs [RFC4364] is used to provide a
       Virtual Network service to end-systems.  These end-systems may be
       used to provide network services or may directly host end-to-end

  "Encoding mLDP FECs in the NLRI of BGP MCAST-VPN Routes", IJsbrand
  Wijnands, Eric Rosen, Uwe Joorde, 15-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-mldp-nlri-01.txt>

    Many service providers offer "BGP/MPLS IP VPN" service to their
       customers.  Existing IETF standards specify the procedures and
       protocols that a service provider uses in order to offer this service
       to customers who have IP unicast and IP multicast traffic in their
       VPNs.  It is also desirable to be able to support customers who have
       MPLS multicast traffic in their VPNs.  This document specifies the
       procedures and protocol extensions that are needed to support
       customers who use the Multicast Extensions to Label Distribution
       Protocol (mLDP) as the control protocol for their MPLS multicast
       traffic.  Existing standards do provide some support for customers
       who use mLDP, but only under a restrictive set of circumstances.
       This document generalizes the existing support to include all cases
       where the customer uses mLDP, without any restrictions.

  "Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol In-Band Signaling in a VRF
  Context", IJsbrand Wijnands, Paul Hitchen, Nicolai Leymann, Wim
  Henderickx,  arkadiy.gulko@thomsonreuters.com, 21-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-l3vpn-mldp-vrf-in-band-signaling-01.txt>

    Sometimes an IP multicast distribution tree (MDT) traverses both
       MPLS-enabled and non-MPLS-enabled regions of a network.  Typically
       the MDT begins and ends in non-MPLS regions, but travels through an
       MPLS region.  In such cases, it can be useful to begin building the
       MDT as a pure IP MDT, then convert it to an MPLS Multipoint LSP
       (Label Switched Path) when it enters an MPLS-enabled region, and then
       convert it back to a pure IP MDT when it enters a non-MPLS-enabled
       region.  Other documents specify the procedures for building such a
       hybrid MDT, using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) in the non-
       MPLS region of the network, and using Multipoint Extensions to Label
       Distribution Protocol (mLDP) in the MPLS region.  This document
       extends those procedures to handle the case where the link connecting
       the two regions is a "Virtual Routing and Forwarding Table" (VRF)
       link, as defined in the "BGP IP/MPLS VPN" specifications.  However,
       this document is primarily aimed at particular use cases where VRFs
       are used to support multicast applications other than Multicast VPN.

  "Extranet Multicast in BGP/IP MPLS VPNs", Yakov Rekhter, Eric Rosen,
  Rahul Aggarwal, Yiqun Cai, Wim Henderickx, Thomas Morin, Praveen Muley,
  Ray Qiu, IJsbrand Wijnands, 8-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-extranet-01.txt>

    Previous RFCs specify the procedures necessary to allow IP multicast
       traffic to travel from one site to another within a BGP/MPLS IP VPN
       (Virtual Private Network).  However, it is sometimes desirable to
       allow multicast traffic whose source is in one VPN to be received by
       systems that are in another VPN.  This is known as a "Multicast VPN
       (MVPN) extranet".  This document updates RFCs 6513, 6514, and 6625 by
       specifying the procedures that are necessary in order to provide MVPN
       extranet service.

Locator/ID Separation Protocol (lisp)
-------------------------------------

    This document defines the MIB module that contains managed objects to
       support the monitoring devices that support the Locator/ID Separation
       Protocol (LISP).  These objects provide information useful for
       monitoring LISP devices, including determining basic LISP

    This is a direction to IANA to allocate a /16 IPv6 prefix for use
       with the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP).  The prefix will be
       used for local intra-domain routing and global endpoint

    This document analyzes the potential threats against the security of
       the Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) if deployed in the
       Internet.  This document proposes a set of recommendations to
       mitigate the identified security risks and keep a security level
       equivalent to what is observed in the Internet today (i.e., without
       LISP).  By following the recommendations of this draft a LISP
       deployment can achieve a security level that is comparable to the

  "LISP Delegated Database Tree", Vince Fuller, Darrel Lewis, Vina
  Ermagan, Amit Jain, 28-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-lisp-ddt-01.txt>

    This draft describes the LISP Delegated Database Tree (LISP-DDT), a
       hierarchical, distributed database which embodies the delegation of
       authority to provide mappings from LISP Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs)
       to Routing Locators (RLOCs).  It is a statically-defined distribution
       of the EID namespace among a set of LISP-speaking servers, called DDT
       nodes.  Each DDT node is configured as "authoritative" for one or
       more EID-prefixes, along with the set of RLOCs for Map Servers or
       "child" DDT nodes to which more-specific EID-prefixes are delegated.

  "An Architectural Perspective on the LISP Location-Identity Separation
  System", J. Chiappa, 18-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-lisp-perspective-00.txt>

    LISP upgrades the architecture of the IPvN internetworking system by
       separating location and identity, current intermingled in IPvN
       addresses.  This is a change which has been identified by the IRTF as
       a critically necessary evolutionary architectural step for the
       Internet.  In LISP, nodes have both a 'locator' (a name which says
       _where_ in the network's connectivity structure the node is) and an
       'identifier' (a name which serves only to provide a persistent handle
       for the node).  A node may have more than one locator, or its locator
       may change over time (e.g. if the node is mobile), but it keeps the
       same identifier.
    
       This document gives additional architectural insight into LISP, and
       considers a number of aspects of LISP from a high-level standpoint.
    
       [NOTE: This is still a somewhat rough draft version; a few sections
       at the end are just rough frameworks, but almost all the key

       something like reasonably complete form.]

Light-Weight Implementation Guidance (lwig)
-------------------------------------------

  "Guidance for Light-Weight Implementations of the Internet Protocol
  Suite", Carsten Bormann, 25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-lwig-guidance-03.txt>

    Implementation of Internet protocols on small devices benefits from
       light-weight implementation techniques, which are often not
       documented in an accessible way.
    
       This document provides a first outline of and some initial content
       for the Light-Weight Implementation Guidance document planned by the

       useful in the standardization work for constrained environments.

  "Minimal IKEv2", Tero Kivinen, 11-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-lwig-ikev2-minimal-00.txt>

    This document describes minimal version of the Internet Key Exchange
       version 2 (IKEv2) protocol.  IKEv2 is a component of IPsec used for
       performing mutual authentication and establishing and maintaining
       Security Associations (SAs).  IKEv2 includes several optional
       features, which are not needed in minimal implementations.  This
       document describes what is required from the minimal implementation,
       and also describes various optimizations which can be done.  The
       protocol described here is compliant with full IKEv2 with exception
       that this document only describes shared secret authentication (IKEv2
       requires support for certificate authentication in addition to shared
       secret authentication).
    
       This document does not update or modify RFC 5996, but provides more
       compact description of the minimal version of the protocol.  If this
       document and RFC 5996 conflicts then RFC 5996 is the authoritative
       description.

Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (manet)
------------------------------

  "The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2", Thomas Clausen,
  Christopher Dearlove, Philippe Jacquet, Ulrich Herberg, 23-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-manet-olsrv2-19.txt>

    This specification describes version 2 of the Optimized Link State
       Routing (OLSRv2) protocol for Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs).

  "Definition of Managed Objects for the Manet Simplified Multicast
  Framework Relay Set Process", Robert Cole, Joseph Macker, Brian Adamson,
  21-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-07.txt,.pdf>

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
       for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
       In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of the
       Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) process for Mobile Ad-Hoc
       Networks (MANETs).  The SMF-MIB also reports state information,
       performance metrics, and notifications.  In addition to
       configuration, the additional state and performance information is
       useful to operators troubleshooting multicast forwarding problems.

  "Definition of Managed Objects for the Optimized Link State Routing
  Protocol version 2", Ulrich Herberg, Robert Cole, Thomas Clausen,
  12-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-manet-olsrv2-mib-11.txt>

    This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module
       for configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing
       protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).  The OLSRv2-MIB module is structured
       into configuration information, state information, performance
       information, and notifications.  This additional state and
       performance information is useful to troubleshoot problems and
       performance issues of the routing protocol.  Two levels of compliance
       allow this MIB module to be deployed on constrained routers.

  "Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP)", Stan Ratliff, Cisco Cisco, Greg
  Harrison, Darryl Satterwhite, Shawn Jury, 25-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-manet-dlep-04.txt>

    When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over
       wireless links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the
       characteristics of the link (speed, state, etc.) in order to make
       forwarding decisions. In mobile or other environments where these
       characteristics change frequently, manual configurations or the
       inference of state through routing or transport protocols does not
       allow the router to make the best decisions. A bidirectional, event-
       driven communication channel between the router and the modem is
       necessary.

  "Security Threats for NHDP", Jiazi Yi, Ulrich Herberg, Thomas Clausen,
  17-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-sec-threats-06.txt>

    This document analyzes common security threats of the Neighborhood
       Discovery Protocol (NHDP), and describes their potential impacts on
       MANET routing protocols using NHDP.  This document is not intended to
       propose solutions to the threats described.

  "Link Metrics for the Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Routing Protocol
  OLSRv2 - Rationale", Christopher Dearlove, Thomas Clausen, Philippe
  Jacquet, 1-May-13, <draft-ietf-manet-olsrv2-metrics-rationale-04.txt>

    OLSRv2 includes the ability to assign metrics to links and to use
       those metrics to allow routing by other than minimum hop count
       routes.  This document provides a historic record of the rationale
       for, and design considerations behind, how link metrics were included
       in OLSRv2.

  "Dynamic MANET On-demand (AODVv2) Routing", Charles Perkins, Stan
  Ratliff, John Dowdell, 12-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-manet-aodvv2-00.txt>

    The revised Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODVv2) routing
       protocol is intended for use by mobile routers in wireless, multihop
       networks.  AODVv2 determines unicast routes among AODVv2 routers
       within the network in an on-demand fashion, offering on-demand
       convergence in dynamic topologies.

  "Integrity Protection for Control Messages in NHDP and OLSRv2", Ulrich
  Herberg, Christopher Dearlove, Thomas Clausen, 15-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-olsrv2-sec-02.txt>

    This document specifies integrity and replay protection for required
       implementation in the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)
       and the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).
       This document specifies how an included integrity check value (ICV)
       and a timestamp TLV, defined in RFC6622bis, are used by NHDP and
       OLSRv2 for countering a number of security threats.  The ICV TLV uses
       a SHA-256 based HMAC and one or more shared secret keys.  The
       timestamp TLV is based on POSIX time, and assumes that the clocks in
       all routers in the network can be synchronized with sufficient
       precision.  The mechanism in this specification can also be used for
       other MANET protocols using RFC5444.

  "Integrity Check Value and Timestamp TLV Definitions for Mobile Ad Hoc
  Networks (MANETs)", Ulrich Herberg, Thomas Clausen, Christopher
  Dearlove, 15-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-manet-rfc6622-bis-02.txt>

    This document revises, extends and replaces RFC 6622.  It describes
       general and flexible TLVs for representing cryptographic Integrity
       Check Values (ICVs) and timestamps, using the generalized Mobile Ad
       Hoc Network (MANET) packet/message format defined in RFC 5444.  It
       defines two Packet TLVs, two Message TLVs, and two Address Block TLVs
       for affixing ICVs and timestamps to a packet, a message, and one or
       more addresses, respectively.

MBONE Deployment (mboned)
-------------------------

  "Automatic Multicast Tunneling", Gregory Bumgardner, 12-Jun-12,
  <draft-ietf-mboned-auto-multicast-14.txt>

    This document describes Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT), a
       protocol for delivering multicast traffic from sources in a
       multicast-enabled network to receivers that lack multicast
       connectivity to the source network.  The protocol uses UDP
       encapsulation and unicast replication to provide this functionality.
    
       The AMT protocol is specifically designed to support rapid deployment
       by requiring minimal changes to existing network infrastructure.

  "IPv6 Multicast Address With Embedded IPv4 Multicast Address", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Jacni Qin, Yiu Lee, Stig Venaas, Xing Li, Mingwei Xu,
  18-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format-05.txt>

    This document reserves one bit (M-bit) of the unicast prefix-based
       multicast IPv6 address for ASM and an IPv6 multicast prefix for SSM
       mode to be used in the context of IPv4-IPv6 interconnection.
    
       The document specifies an algorithmic translation of an IPv6
       multicast address to a corresponding IPv4 multicast address, and vice
       versa.  This algorithmic translation can be used in both IPv4-IPv6
       translation or encapsulation schemes.

  "IPv4-IPv6 Multicast: Problem Statement and Use Cases", Christian
  Jacquenet, Mohamed Boucadair, Yiu Lee, Jacni Qin, Tina Tsou, Qiong Sun,
  5-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps-03.txt>

    This document discusses issues and requirements raised by IPv4-IPv6
       multicast interconnection and co-existence scenarios.  It also
       discusses various multicast use cases which may occur during IPv6
       transitioning.

  "Address Acquisition For Multicast Content When Source and Receiver
  Support Differing IP Versions", Tina Tsou, Axel Clauberg, Mohamed
  Boucadair, Stig Venaas, Qiong Sun, 3-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-mboned-multrans-addr-acquisition-01.txt>

    Each IPTV operator has their own arrangements for pre-provisioning
       program information including addresses of the multicast groups
       corresponding to broadcast programs on the subscriber receiver.
       During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, scenarios can occur where
       the IP version supported by the receiver differs from that supported
       by the source.  This memo examines what has to be done to allow the
       receiver to acquire multicast address information in the version it
       supports in such scenarios.

  "Multicast in the Data Center Overview", Mike McBride, 19-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-mboned-dc-deploy-00.txt>

    There has been much interest in issues surrounding massive amounts of
       hosts in the data center.  These issues include the prevalent use of
       IP Multicast within the Data Center.  Its important to understand how
       IP Multicast is being deployed in the Data Center to be able to
       understand the surrounding issues with doing so.  This document
       provides a quick survey of uses of multicast in the data center and
       should serve as an aid to further discussion of issues related to
       large amounts of multicast in the data center.

Media Server Control (mediactrl)
--------------------------------

  "Media Control Channel Framework (CFW) Call Flow Examples", Alessandro
  Amirante, Tobia Castaldi, Lorenzo Miniero, Simon Romano, 23-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-mediactrl-call-flows-13.txt>

    This document provides a list of typical Media Control Channel
       Framework call flows.  It aims at being a simple guide to the use of
       the interface between Application Servers and MEDIACTRL-based Media
       Servers, as well as a base reference documentation for both
       implementors and protocol researchers.

Multiple Interfaces (mif)
-------------------------

  "Happy Eyeballs Extension for Multiple Interfaces", Gang Chen, Carl
  Williams, Dan Wing, Andrew Yourtchenko, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-mif-happy-eyeballs-extension-02.txt>

    Currently the interface selection in multi-interface environment is
       exclusive - only one interface can be used at the time, frequently
       needing manual intervention.  Happy Eyeballs in MIF would make the
       selection process smoother by using the connectivity checks over a
       pre-filtered interfaces according to defined policy.  This would
       choose "best" interface with an automatic fallback.

Managed Incident Lightweight Exchange (mile)
--------------------------------------------

  "IODEF-extension for structured cybersecurity information", Takeshi
  Takahashi, Kent Landfield, Tom Millar, Youki Kadobayashi, 18-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-mile-sci-07.txt,.pdf>

    This document extends the Incident Object Description Exchange Format
       (IODEF) defined in RFC 5070 [RFC5070] to exchange enriched
       cybersecurity information among cybersecurity entities and facilitate
       their operations.  It provides the capability of embedding structured
       information, such as identifier- and XML-based information.

  "IODEF Usage Guidance", Panos Kampanakis, 29-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-mile-iodef-guidance-00.txt>

    The Incident Object Description Exchange Format [RFC5070] defines a
       data representation that provides a framework for sharing information
       commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams
       (CSIRTs) about computer security incidents.  Since the IODEF model
       includes a wealth of available options that can be used to describe a
       security incident or issue, it can be challenging for implementers to
       develop tools that can Leverage IODEF for incident sharing.  This
       document provides guidelines for IODEF users and implementers.  It
       will also address how common security indicators can be represented
       in IODEF.  The goal of this document is to make IODEF's adoption by
       vendors easier and encourage faster and wider adoption of the model
       by Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) around the
       world.

  "The Incident Object Description Exchange Format", Roman Danyliw, Paul
  Stoecker, 5-May-13, <draft-ietf-mile-rfc5070-bis-00.txt>

    The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a
       data representation that provides a framework for sharing information
       commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams
       (CSIRTs) about computer security incidents.  This document describes
       the information model for the IODEF and provides an associated data
       model specified with XML Schema.

Mobility for IPv4 (mip4)
------------------------

  "Flow Binding Support for Mobile IPv4", Sri Gundavelli, Kent Leung,
  George Tsirtsis, Hesham Soliman, Alexandru Petrescu, 31-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-mip4-multiple-tunnel-support-05.txt>

    This specification defines extensions to Mobile IPv4 protocol for
       allowing a mobile node with multiple interfaces to register a care-of
       address for each of its network interfaces and to simultaneously
       establish multiple Mobile IP tunnels with its home agent.  This
       essentially allows the mobile node to utilize all the available
       network interfaces and build an higher aggregated data pipe with the
       home agent for its home address traffic.  Furthermore, these
       extensions also allow the mobile node and the home agent to negotiate
       flow policies for binding individual traffic flows with the
       registered care-of addresses.

Mobility for IP: Performance, Signaling and Handoff Optimization (mipshop)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  "Prefix Management for Mobile IPv6 Fast Handover on Point-to-Point
  Links", Frank Xia, Behcet Sarikaya, 21-Dec-12,
  <draft-ietf-mipshop-fmip-ptp-05.txt>

    Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers specification currently does not
    explicitly define prefix management over point-to-point links when a
    mobile node uses a prefix to formulate a new care-of-address.  In
    this document a mechanism is developed for a previous access router
    to request unique prefixes from a new access router, and in turn, the
    previous access router advertises the prefixes to the mobile node for
    a new care-of-address configuration.  Extensions to Mobile IPv6 Fast
    Handovers specification are also specified in this document.

Multiparty Multimedia Session Control (mmusic)
----------------------------------------------

  "Real Time Streaming Protocol 2.0 (RTSP)", Henning Schulzrinne, Anup
  Rao, Rob Lanphier, Magnus Westerlund, Martin Stiemerling, 4-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis-34.txt>

    This memorandum defines RTSP version 2.0 which obsoletes RTSP version
       1.0 defined in RFC 2326.
    
       The Real Time Streaming Protocol, or RTSP, is an application-level
       protocol for setup and control of the delivery of data with real-time
       properties.  RTSP provides an extensible framework to enable
       controlled, on-demand delivery of real-time data, such as audio and
       video.  Sources of data can include both live data feeds and stored
       clips.  This protocol is intended to control multiple data delivery
       sessions, provide a means for choosing delivery channels such as UDP,
       multicast UDP and TCP, and provide a means for choosing delivery
       mechanisms based upon RTP (RFC 3550).

  "A Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal mechanism for media
  controlled by Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)", Jeff Goldberg,
  Magnus Westerlund, Thomas Zeng, 27-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-rtsp-nat-16.txt>

    This document defines a solution for Network Address Translation
       (NAT) traversal for datagram based media streams setup and controlled
       with Real-time Streaming Protocol version 2 (RTSP 2.0).  It uses
       Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) adapted to use RTSP as a
       signalling channel, defining the necessary extra RTSP extensions and
       procedures.

  "The Evaluation of Different Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal
  Techniques for Media Controlled by Real-time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)",
  Magnus Westerlund, Thomas Zeng, 29-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-rtsp-nat-evaluation-09.txt>

    This document describes several Network Address Translator (NAT)
       traversal techniques that were considered to be used for establishing
       the RTP media flows controlled by the Real-time Streaming Protocol
       (RTSP).  Each technique includes a description on how it would be
       used, the security implications of using it and any other deployment
       considerations it has.  There are also discussions on how NAT
       traversal techniques relates to firewalls and how each technique can
       be applied in different use cases.  These findings where used when
       selecting the NAT traversal for RTSP 2.0.

  "SDP: Session Description Protocol", Mark Handley, Van Jacobson, Colin
  Perkins, Ali Begen, 11-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-mmusic-rfc4566bis-08.txt>

    This memo defines the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  SDP is
       intended for describing multimedia sessions for the purposes of
       session announcement, session invitation, and other forms of
       multimedia session initiation.  This document obsoletes RFC 4566.

  "Analysis of Middlebox Interactions for Signaling Protocol Communication
  along the Media Path", Brian Stucker, Hannes Tschofenig, Gonzalo
  Salgueiro, 30-May-13, <draft-ietf-mmusic-media-path-middleboxes-07.txt>

    Middleboxes are defined as any intermediary box performing functions
       apart from normal, standard functions of an IP router on the data
       path between a source host and destination host.  Two such functions
       are network address translation and firewalling.
    
       When Application Layer Gateways, such as SIP entities, interact with
       NATs and firewalls, as described in the MIDCOM architecture, then
       problems may occur in the transport of media traffic when signaling
       protocol interaction takes place along the media path, as it is the
       case for recent key exchange proposals (such as DTLS-SRTP).  This
       document highlights problems that may arise.  Unfortunately, it is
       difficult for the end points to detect or predict problematic
       behavior and to determine whether the media path is reliably
       available for packet exchange.
    
       This document aims to summarize the various sources and effects of
       NAT and firewall control, the reasons that they exist, and possible
       means of improving their behavior to allow protocols that rely upon
       signaling along the media path to operate effectively.

  "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Extension For Setting Audio and
  Video Media Streams Over Circuit-Switched Bearers In The Public Switched
  Telephone Network (PSTN)", Miguel Garcia, Simo Veikkolainen, 6-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-cs-20.txt>

    This memo describes use cases, requirements, and protocol extensions
       for using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer model
       for establishing audio and video media streams over circuit-switched
       bearers in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).

  "Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)-Based Media Transport in
  the Session Description Protocol (SDP)", Salvatore Loreto, Gonzalo
  Camarillo, 21-Jan-13, <draft-ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp-03.txt>

    SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) is a transport protocol
       used to establish associations between two endpoints.  This document
       describes how to express media transport over SCTP in SDP (Session
       Description Protocol).  This document defines the 'SCTP', 'SCTP/DTLS'
       and 'DTLS/SCTP' protocol identifiers for SDP.

  "The Session Description Protocol (SDP) 'trafficclass' Attribute", James
  Polk, Subha Dhesikan, Paul Jones, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-traffic-class-for-sdp-03.txt>

    This document proposes a new Session Description Protocol (SDP)
       attribute to identify the traffic class a session is requesting
       in its offer/answer exchange.

  "Multiplexing Negotiation Using Session Description Protocol (SDP) Port
  Numbers", Christer Holmberg, Harald Alvestrand, Cullen Jennings,
  14-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation-04.txt>

    This specification defines a new SDP Grouping Framework extension,
       "BUNDLE", that can be used with the Session Description Protocol
       (SDP) Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of bundled media,
       which refers to the usage of a single 5-tuple for media associated
       with multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" lines).

  "Miscellaneous Capabilities Negotiation in the Session Description
  Protocol (SDP)", Miguel Garcia, Simo Veikkolainen, Robert Gilman,
  5-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-miscellaneous-caps-06.txt>

    SDP has been extended with a capability negotiation mechanism
       framework that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport protocols
       and attributes.  This framework has been extended with a media
       capabilities negotiation mechanism that allows endpoints to negotiate
       additional media-related capabilities.  This negotiation is embedded
       into the widely-used SDP offer/answer procedures.
    
       This memo extends the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow
       endpoints to negotiate three additional SDP capabilities.  In
       particular, this memo provides a mechanism to negotiate bandwidth
       ('b=' line), connection data ('c=' line), and titles ('i=' line for
       each session or media).

  "Delayed Duplication Attribute in the Session Description Protocol", Ali
  Begen, Yiqun Cai, Heidi Ou, 27-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-delayed-duplication-02.txt>

    A straightforward approach to provide protection against packet
       losses due to network outages with a longest duration of T time units
       is to simply duplicate the original packets and send each copy
       separated in time by at least T time units.  This approach is
       commonly referred to as Time-shifted Redundancy, Temporal Redundancy
       or simply Delayed Duplication.  This document defines an attribute to
       indicate the presence of temporally redundant media streams and the
       duplication delay in the Session Description Protocol.

  "Duplication Grouping Semantics in the Session Description Protocol",
  Ali Begen, Yiqun Cai, Heidi Ou, 27-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-duplication-grouping-02.txt>

    Packet loss is undesirable for real-time multimedia sessions, but can
       occur due to congestion, or other unplanned network outages.  This is
       especially true for IP multicast networks, where packet loss patterns
       can vary greatly between receivers.  One technique that can be used
       to recover from packet loss without incurring unbounded delay for all
       the receivers is to duplicate the packets and send them in separate
       redundant streams.  This document defines the semantics for grouping
       redundant streams in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  The
       semantics defined in this document are to be used with the SDP
       Grouping Framework [RFC5888].  SSRC-level (Synchronization Source)
       grouping semantics are also defined in this document for RTP streams
       using SSRC multiplexing.

  "Latching: Hosted NAT Traversal (HNT) for Media in Real-Time
  Communication", Emil Ivov, Hadriel Kaplan, Dan Wing, 10-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-latching-02.txt>

    This document describes behavior of signalling intermediaries in
       Real-Time Communication (RTC) deployments, sometimes referred to as
       Session Border Controllers (SBCs), when performing Hosted NAT
       Traversal (HNT).  HNT is a set of mechanisms, such as media relaying
       and latching, that such intermediaries use to enable other RTC
       devices behind NATs to communicate with each other.  This document is
       non-normative, and is only written to explain HNT in order to provide
       a reference to the IETF community, as well as an informative
       description to manufacturers, and users.

  "Offer/Answer Considerations for G723 Annex A and G729 Annex B", Muthu
  Perumal, Parthasarathi Ravindran, 17-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-g723-g729-03.txt>

    RFC4856 describes the annexa parameter for G723 and the annexb
       parameter for G729, G729D and G729E. However, the specification does
       not describe the offerer and answerer behavior when the value of the
       annexa or annexb parameter does not match in the Session Description
       protocol(SDP) offer and answer.  This document provides the offer/
       answer considerations for these parameters and updates RFC4856.

  "Cross Session Stream Identification in the Session Description
  Protocol", Harald Alvestrand, 10-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-mmusic-msid-00.txt>

    This document specifies a grouping mechanism for RTP media streams
       that can be used to specify relations between media streams within
       different RTP sessions as well as within a single RTP session, and
       independently of whether these media streams are described within one
       SDP m-line or in multiple m-lines.
    
       This mechanism is used to signal the association between the RTP
       concept of SSRC and the WebRTC concept of "MediaStream" /
       "MediaStreamTrack" using SDP signaling.
    
       This document is a work item of the MMUSIC WG, whose discussion list
       is mmusic@ietf.org.

Multiprotocol Label Switching (mpls)
------------------------------------

  "A Thesaurus for the Terminology used in Multiprotocol Label Switching
  Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) drafts/RFCs and ITU-T's Transport Network
  Recommendations.", Huub van Helvoort, Loa Andersson, Nurit Sprecher,
  12-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-rosetta-stone-10.txt>

    MPLS-TP is based on a profile of the MPLS and PW procedures as
       specified in the MPLS-TE and (MS-)PW architectures developed by the
       IETF.  The ITU-T has specified a Transport Network architecture.
    
       This document provides a thesaurus for the interpretation of MPLS-TP
       terminology within the context of the ITU-T Transport Network
       recommendations.
    
       It is important to note that MPLS-TP is applicable in a wider set of

       this document do not provide exclusive nor complete interpretations
       of MPLS-TP concepts.  This document simply allows the MPLS-TP terms

  "Return Path Specified LSP Ping", Mach Chen, Wei Cao, So Ning, Frederic
  JOUNAY, Simon DeLord, 21-Oct-12,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-return-path-specified-lsp-ping-11.txt>

    This document defines extensions to the failure-detection protocol
       for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
       known as "LSP Ping" that allow selection of the LSP to use for the
       echo reply return path.  Enforcing a specific return path can be used
       to verify bidirectional connectivity and also increase LSP ping
       robustness.  It may also be used by Bidirectional Forwarding
       Detection (BFD) for MPLS bootstrap signaling thereby making BFD for
       MPLS more robust.

  "Updates to LDP for IPv6", Rajiv Asati, Vishwas Manral, Rajiv Papneja,
  Carlos Pignataro, 25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-ipv6-08.txt>

    The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) specification defines
       procedures to exchange label bindings over either IPv4, or IPv6 or
       both networks. This document corrects and clarifies the LDP behavior
       when IPv6 network is used (with or without IPv4). This document
       updates RFC 5036.

  "Configuration of Pro-Active Operations, Administration, and Maintenance

  Bellagamba, Loa Andersson, Pontus Skoldstrom, David Ward, John Drake,
  21-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-mpls-tp-oam-conf-06.txt>

    This specification describes the configuration of pro-active MPLS-TP
       Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Functions for a
       given LSP using a set of TLVs that are carried by the LSP-Ping
       protocol.
    
       This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
       (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication

       Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
       capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

  "Seamless MPLS Architecture", Nicolai Leymann, Bruno Decraene, Clarence
  Filsfils, Maciek Konstantynowicz, Dirk Steinberg, 13-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls-03.txt>

    This documents describes an architecture which can be used to extend
       MPLS networks to integrate access and aggregation networks into a
       single MPLS domain ("Seamless MPLS").  The Seamless MPLS approach is
       based on existing and well known protocols.  It provides a highly
       flexible and a scalable architecture and the possibility to integrate
       100.000 of nodes.  The separation of the service and transport plane
       is one of the key elements; Seamless MPLS provides end to end service
       independent transport.  Therefore it removes the need for service
       specific configurations in network transport nodes (without end to
       end transport MPLS, some additional services nodes/configurations
       would be required to glue each transport domain).  This draft defines
       a routing architecture using existing standardized protocols.  It
       does not invent any new protocols or defines extensions to existing
       protocols.

  "Inter-Area P2MP Segmented LSPs", Yakov Rekhter, Rahul Aggarwal,
  14-May-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-seamless-mcast-07.txt>

    This document describes procedures for building inter-area point-to-
       multipoint (P2MP) segmented service LSPs by partitioning such LSPs
       into intra-area segments and using BGP as the inter-area routing and
       label distribution protocol. Within each IGP area the intra-area
       segments are either carried over intra-area P2MP LSPs, using P2MP LSP
       hierarchy, or instantiated using ingress replication.  The intra-area
       P2MP LSPs may be signaled using P2MP RSVP-TE or P2MP mLDP. If ingress
       replication is used within an IGP area, then MP2P LDP LSPs or P2P
       RSVP-TE LSPs may be used in the IGP area. The applications/services
       that use such inter-area service LSPs may be BGP MVPN, VPLS
       multicast, or global table multicast over MPLS.

  "Disabling IPoMPLS and P2P PW LDP Application's State Advertisement",
  Kamran Raza, Sami Boutros, 20-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-ip-pw-capability-06.txt>

    Currently, no LDP capability is exchanged for LDP applications like
       IP Label Switching and L2VPN P2P PW signaling. When an LDP session
       comes up, an LDP speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state
       for such LDP applications even when the peer session is established
       for some other applications like mLDP or ICCP. This document defines
       a solution by which an LDP speaker announces to its peer its
       disinterest in such non-negotiated applications. This, in turn,
       disables the advertisement of corresponding application state, which
       would have otherwise be advertised by default, over the established
       LDP session.

  "MPLS-TP Traffic Engineering (TE) Management Information Base (MIB)",
  Venkatesan Mahalingam, Kannan Sampath, Sam Aldrin, Thomas Nadeau,
  8-May-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-te-mib-06.txt>

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
       for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
       In particular, it describes managed objects of Tunnels, Identifiers,
       Label Switch Router and Textual conventions for Multiprotocol Label
       Switching (MPLS) based Transport Profile (TP).

  "Definition of Time-to-Live TLV for LSP-Ping Mechanisms", Sami Boutros,
  Siva Sivabalan, George Swallow, Shaleen Saxena, Vishwas Manral, Sam
  Aldrin, 20-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-ttl-tlv-05.txt>

    LSP-Ping is a widely deployed Operation, Administration, and
       Maintenance (OAM) mechanism in MPLS networks. However, in the present
       form, this mechanism is inadequate to verify connectivity of a
       segment of a Multi-Segment PseudoWire (MS-PW) from any node on the
       path of the MS-PW. This document defines a TLV to address this
       shortcoming.

  "LDP Extensions for Multi Topology Routing", Quintin Zhao, Luyuan Fang,
  Chao Zhou, Lianyuan Li, Kamran Raza, 13-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology-08.txt>

    Multi-Topology (MT) routing is supported in IP networks with the use
       of MT aware IGP protocols.  In order to provide MT routing within
       Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Distribution Protocol
       (LDP) networks new extensions are required.  This document updates
       RFC4379.
    
       This document describes the LDP protocol extensions required to
       support MT routing in an MPLS environment.

  "Performance-based Path Selection for Explicitly Routed LSPs", Alia
  Atlas, John Drake, Spencer Giacalone, David Ward, Stefano Previdi,
  Clarence Filsfils, 6-Feb-13, <draft-atlas-mpls-te-express-path-02.txt>

    In certain networks, it is critical to consider network performance
       criteria when selecting the path for an explicitly routed RSVP-TE
       LSP.  Such performance criteria can include latency, jitter, and loss
       or other indications such as the conformance to link SLAs and non-
       RSVP TE traffic load.  This specification uses IGP extension data
       (which is defined outside the scope of this document) to perform such
       path selections.

  "Applicability of MPLS-TP Linear Protection for Ring Topologies", Yaacov
  Weingarten, Stewart Bryant, Daniele Ceccarelli, Diego Caviglia,
  Francesco Fondelli, Marco Corsi, Wu Bo, Xuehui Dai, 30-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-ring-protection-06.txt>

    This document presents an applicability of existing MPLS protection
       mechanisms, both local and end-to-end, to Multi-Protocol Label
       Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) in ring topologies.  This
       document does not propose any new mechanisms or protocols.
       Protection on rings offers a number of opportunities for optimization
       as the protection choices are starkly limited (all traffic traveling
       one way around a ring can only be switched to travel the other way on
       the ring), but also suffers from some complications caused by the
       limitations of the topology.
    
       Requirements for MPLS-TP protection especially for protection in ring
       topologies are discussed in "Requirements of an MPLS Transport
       Profile" (RFC 5654) and "MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
       Survivability Framework" (RFC 6372).  This document shows how MPLS-TP
       linear protection as defined in RFC 6378 can be applied to single
       ring topologies, discusses how most of the requirements are met, and
       describes scenarios in which the function provided by applying linear
       protection in a ring topology falls short of some of the
       requirements.
    
       This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
       (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
       Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
       Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
       capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
       defined by the ITU-T.

  "Per-Interface MIP Addressing Requirements and Design Considerations",
  Adrian Farrel, Hideki Endo, Rolf Winter, Yoshinori Koike, Manuel Paul,
  22-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mip-mep-map-07.txt>

    The Framework for Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)
       within the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) describes how Maintenance
       Entity Group Intermediate Points (MIPs) may be situated within
       network nodes at the incoming and outgoing interfaces.
    
       This document elaborates on important considerations for internal MIP
       addressing.  More precisely it describes important restrictions for
       any mechanism that specifies a way of forming OAM messages so that
       they can be targeted at MIPs on incoming or MIPs on outgoing
       interfaces and forwarded correctly through the forwarding engine.
       Furthermore, the document includes considerations for node
       implementations where there is no distinction between the incoming
       and outgoing MIP.

  "MPLS-TP Applicability; Use Cases and Design", Luyuan Fang, Nabil Bitar,
  Raymond Zhang, Masahiro Daikoku, Ping Pan, 1-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-use-cases-and-design-08.txt>

    This document provides the applicability of Multiprotocol Label
       Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) with use case studies and
       network design considerations. The use cases include Metro Ethernet
       access and aggregation transport, Mobile backhaul, and packet optical
       transport.

  "LDP Downstream-on-Demand in Seamless MPLS", Thomas Beckhaus, Bruno
  Decraene, Kishore Tiruveedhula, Maciek Konstantynowicz, Luca Martini,
  13-May-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-dod-08.txt>

    Seamless MPLS design enables a single IP/MPLS network to scale over
       core, metro and access parts of a large packet network infrastructure
       using standardized IP/MPLS protocols.  One of the key goals of
       Seamless MPLS is to meet requirements specific to access, including
       high number of devices, their position in network topology and their
       compute and memory constraints that limit the amount of state access
       devices can hold.This can be achieved with LDP Downstream-on-Demand
       (LDP DoD) label advertisement.  This document describes LDP DoD use
       cases and lists required LDP DoD procedures in the context of
       Seamless MPLS design.
    
       In addition, a new optional TLV type in the LDP Label Request message
       is defined for fast-up convergence.

  "MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) Advertisement Protocol", Dan
  Frost, Stewart Bryant, Matthew Bocci, 7-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-gach-adv-08.txt>

    The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) provides an auxiliary
       logical data channel associated with a Label Switched Path (LSP), a
       pseudowire, or a section (link) over which a variety of protocols may
       flow.  These protocols are commonly used to provide Operations,
       Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms associated with the
       primary data channel.  This document specifies simple procedures by
       which an endpoint of an LSP, pseudowire, or section may inform the
       other endpoints of its capabilities and configuration parameters, or
       other application-specific information.  This information may then be
       used by the receiver to validate or adjust its local configuration,
       and by the network operator for diagnostic purposes.

  "MPLS-TP Next-Hop Ethernet Addressing", Dan Frost, Stewart Bryant,
  Matthew Bocci, 8-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing-07.txt>

    The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
       is the set of MPLS protocol functions applicable to the construction
       and operation of packet-switched transport networks.  This document
       presents considerations for link-layer addressing of Ethernet frames
       carrying MPLS-TP packets.

  "mLDP Node Protection", IJsbrand Wijnands, Eric Rosen, Kamran Raza, Jeff
  Tantsura, Alia Atlas, Quintin Zhao, 23-Jun-13,
  <draft-wijnands-mpls-mldp-node-protection-04.txt>

    This document describes procedures to support node protection for
       Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths
       (MP LSPs) built by LDP ("Label Distribution Protocol"), or simply
       mLDP.  In order to protect a node N, the Point of Local Repair (PLR)
       LSR of N must learn the Merge Point (MPT) LSR(s) of node N such that
       traffic can be redirected to them in case node N fails.  Redirecting
       the traffic around the failed node N depends on existing P2P LSPs
       originated from the PLR LSR to the MPT LSRs while bypassing LSR node
       N.

  "Temporal and hitless path segment monitoring", Alessandro D'Alessandro,
  Manuel Paul, Satoshi Ueno, Yoshinori Koike, 7-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-temporal-hitless-psm-03.txt>

    The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized to enable
    carrier-grade packet transport and complement converged packet
    network deployments. Among the most attractive features of MPLS-TP
    are OAM functions, which enable network operators or service
    providers to provide various maintenance characteristics, such as
    fault location, survivability, performance monitoring, and
    preliminary or in-service measurements.
    
    One of the most important mechanisms which is common for transport
    network operation is fault location. A segment monitoring function of
    a transport path is effective in terms of extension of the
    maintenance work and indispensable particularly when the OAM function
    is effective only between end points. However, the current approach
    defined for MPLS-TP for the segment monitoring (SPME) has some fatal
    drawbacks. This document elaborates on the problem statement for the
    Sub-path Maintenance Elements (SPMEs) which provides monitoring of a
    portion of a set of transport paths (LSPs or MS-PWs). Based on the
    problems, this document specifies new requirements to consider a new
    improved mechanism of hitless transport path segment monitoring.
    
    This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
    (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications

  Management Information Base (MIB)", Sam Aldrin, Venkatesan Mahalingam,
  Kannan Sampath, Thomas Nadeau, 18-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-id-mib-03.txt>

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
       for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
       In particular, it describes Operations, Administration, and
       Management (OAM) identifiers related managed objects for
       Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) based Transport Profile (TP).

  "LDP Hello Cryptographic Authentication", Lianshu Zheng, Mach Chen,
  Manav Bhatia, 21-Jan-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-hello-crypto-auth-01.txt>

    This document introduces a new optional Cryptographic Authentication
       TLV that LDP can use to secure its Hello messages.  It secures the
       Hello messages against spoofing attacks and some well known attacks
       against the IP header.  This document describes a mechanism to secure
       the LDP Hello messages using National Institute of Standards and
       Technology (NIST) Secure Hash Standard family of algorithms.

  "Using LDP Multipoint Extensions on Targeted LDP Sessions", Maria
  Napierala, Eric Rosen, 28-Jan-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-targeted-mldp-01.txt>

    Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be used to set up
       Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label
       Switched Paths.  The existing specification for this functionality
       assumes that a pair of LDP neighbors are directly connected.
       However, the LDP base specification allows for the case where a pair
       of LDP neighbors are not directly connected; the LDP session between
       such a pair of neighbors is known as a "Targeted LDP" session.  This
       document provides the specification for using the LDP P2MP/MP2MP
       extensions over a Targeted LDP session.

  "MPLS-TP 1toN Protection", Eric Osborne, Fei Zhang, Yaacov Weingarten,
  4-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1ton-protection-01.txt>

    As part of the Transport Profile for Multiprotocol Label Switching
       (MPLS-TP) there is a requirement to support 1:n linear protection for
       transport paths.  This requirement is further elaborated in RFC6372
       [SurvivFwk].  The basic protocol for linear protection, specified in
       RFC6378 [LinProt], is limited to 1+1 and 1:1 protection.  This
       document extends that protocol to address the additional
       functionality necessary to support scenarios where a single
       protection path is preconfigured to provide protection of multiple
       transport paths between two joint endpoints.
    
       This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
       (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
       Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
       Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
       capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
       defined by the ITU-T.

  "Applicability of LDP Label Advertisement Mode", Kamran Raza, Sami
  Boutros, Luca Martini, Nicolai Leymann, 14-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-applicability-label-adv-01.txt>

    An LDP speaker negotiates the label advertisement mode with its LDP
       peer at the time of session establishment. Although different
       applications sharing the same LDP session may need different modes
       of label distribution and advertisement, there is only one type of
       label advertisement mode that is negotiated and used per LDP
       session. This document clarifies the use and the applicability of
       session's negotiated label advertisement mode, and categorizes LDP
       applications into two broad categories of negotiated mode-bound and
       mode-independent applications. The document updates RFC5036 and
       RFC4447 to remove any ambiguity and conflict in the area of using
       correct label advertisement mode for a given application.

  "LDP Extensions for Hub & Spoke Multipoint Label Switched Path", Lizhong
  Jin, Frederic JOUNAY, IJsbrand Wijnands, Nicolai Leymann, 19-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-mldp-hsmp-01.txt>

    This draft introduces a hub & spoke multipoint LSP (short for HSMP
       LSP), which allows traffic both from root to leaf through P2MP LSP
       and also leaf to root along the co-routed reverse path.  That means
       traffic entering the HSMP LSP from application/customer at the root
       node travels downstream, exactly as if it was traveling downstream
       along a P2MP LSP to each leaf node, and traffic entering the HSMP LSP
       at any leaf node travels upstream along the tree to the root as if it
       is unicast to the root, except that it follows the path of the tree
       rather than ordinary unicast to the root.

  "Allocating and Retiring Special Purpose MPLS Labels", Kireeti Kompella,
  Adrian Farrel, 27-May-13,
  <draft-kompella-mpls-special-purpose-labels-04.txt>

    Some MPLS labels have been allocated for specific purposes.  A block
       of labels (0-15) has been set aside to this end, and are commonly
       called "reserved labels".  They will be called "special purpose
       labels" in this document.  As there are only 16 of these labels,
       caution is needed in the allocation of new special purpose labels,
       yet at the same time allow forward progress when one is called for.
       This memo defines some procedures to follow in the allocation and
       retirement of special purpose labels, as well as a method to extend
       the special purpose label space.  Finally, this memo renames the IANA
       registry for these labels to "Special Purpose MPLS Label Values", and
       creates a new one called the "Extended Special Purpose MPLS Label
       Values" registry.

  "Proxy MPLS Echo Request", George Swallow, Vanson Lim, Sam Aldrin,
  7-May-13, <draft-lim-mpls-proxy-lsp-ping-02.txt>

    This document defines a means of remotely initiating Multiprotocol
       Label Switched Protocol Pings on Label Switched Paths.  A proxy ping
       request is sent to any Label Switching Routers along a Label Switched
       Path.  The primary motivations for this facility are first to limit
       the number of messages and related processing when using LSP Ping in
       large Point-to-Multipoint LSPs, and second to enable leaf to leaf/
       root tracing.

  "Signaling RSVP-TE P2MP LSPs in an Inter-domain Environment", Zafar Ali,
  Rakesh Gandhi, Cisco Systems, Robert Venator, Yuji Kamite, 12-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-inter-domain-p2mp-rsvp-te-lsp-01.txt>

    Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
       Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
       LSPs) are established using signaling procedures defined in
       [RFC4875]. However, [RFC4875] does not address several issues that
       arise when a P2MP-TE LSP is signaled in inter-domain networks. One
       such issue is the computation of a loosely routed inter-domain P2MP-
       TE LSP paths that are re-merge free. Another issue is the
       reoptimization of the inter-domain P2MP-TE LSP tree vs. an individual
       destination(s), since the loosely routing domain ingress border node
       is not aware of the reoptimization scope. This document defines the
       required protocol extensions needed for establishing and reoptimizing
       P2MP MPLS and GMPLS TE LSPs in inter-domain networks.

  "Encapsulating MPLS in UDP", KuiKe Building, Nischal Sheth, Lucy Yong,
  Carlos Pignataro, Fan Yongbing, 8-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-in-udp-02.txt>

    Existing technologies to encapsulate Multi-Protocol Label Switching
       (MPLS) over IP are not adequate for efficient load balancing of MPLS
       application traffic, such as MPLS-based Layer2 Virtual Private
       Network (L2VPN) or Layer3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN) traffic
       across IP networks. This document specifies additional IP-based
       encapsulation technology, referred to as MPLS-in-User Datagram
       Protocol (UDP), which can facilitate the load balancing of MPLS
       application traffic across IP networks.

    The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
       is the common set of MPLS protocol functions defined to enable the
       construction and operation of packet transport networks.  The MPLS-TP
       supports both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint transport paths.
       This document defines the elements and functions of the MPLS-TP
       architecture applicable specifically to supporting point-to-
       multipoint transport paths.
    
       This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force

  <draft-pac-mpls-lsp-ping-tlvs-and-sub-tlvs-registry-02.txt>

    This document addresses issues with the structure, allocation
       policies and clarity in the use of the "TLVs and sub-TLVs" of the
       "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
       Ping Parameters" in the "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture
       (MPLS)" name space.
    
       This document does not change any existing allocations and the new
       structure is backwards compatible with the existing registries.
    
       The policy for the allocation of TLVs is unchanged but future
       allocations of sub-TLVs will come from a single namespace, common to
       all TLVs of LSP Ping Parameters.

  "Use of Multipath with MPLS-TP and MPLS", Curtis Villamizar, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-multipath-use-00.txt>

    Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques and
    many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in
    very high bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core
    networks.  MPLS-TP has strongly discouraged the use of multipath
    techniques.  Some degradation of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot be
    avoided when operating over many types of multipath implementations.
    
    Using MPLS Entropy label, MPLS LSPs can be carried over multipath
    links while also providing a fully MPLS-TP compliant server layer for
    MPLS-TP LSPs.  This document describes the means of supporting MPLS
    as a server layer for MPLS-TP.  The use of MPLS-TP LSPs as a server
    layer for MPLS LSPs is also discussed.

  "Relayed Echo Reply mechanism for LSP Ping", Zhi Zheng, Lizhong Jin,
  Thomas Nadeau, George Swallow, 10-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-relay-reply-00.txt>

    In some inter-AS and inter-area deployment scenarios for LSP Ping and
       Traceroute, a replying LSR may not have the available route to the
       initiator, and the Echo Reply message sent to the initiator would be
       discarded resulting in false negatives or complete failure of
       operation of LSP Ping and Traceroute.  This document describes
       extensions to LSP Ping mechanism to enable the replying LSR to have
       the capability to relay the echo response by a set of routable
       intermediate nodes to the initiator during the traceroute process in
       inter-AS and inter-area scenarios.

  "Requirements for MPLS Shared Mesh Protection", Yaacov Weingarten, Sam
  Aldrin, Ping Pan, Jeong-dong Ryoo, Greg Mirsky, 26-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-smp-requirements-00.txt>

    This document presents the basic network objectives for the behavior
       of shared mesh protection (SMP) not based on control-plane support.
       This is an expansion of the basic requirements presented in the MPLS
       Transport Profile Requirements (RFC5654) and MPLS Transport Profile
       Survivability Framework (RFC6372) documents.  This document should be
       used as a basis for the definition of the mechanism that would be
       used to implement SMP for MPLS-TP data paths, in networks that do not
       employ a control plane for their operation.

  "MPLS Forwarding Compliance and Performance Requirements", Curtis
  Villamizar, Kireeti Kompella, Shane Amante, Andrew Malis, Carlos
  Pignataro, 16-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-forwarding-00.txt>

    This document provides guidelines for implementors regarding MPLS
       forwarding and a basis for evaluations of forwarding implementations.
       Guidelines cover many aspects of MPLS forwarding.  Topics are
       highlighted where implementors might potentially overlook practical
       requirements which are unstated or underemphasized or are optional
       for conformance to RFCs.

  "Retiring TLVs from the Associated Channel Header of the MPLS Generic
  Associated Channel", Adrian Farrel, Stewart Bryant, 8-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-retire-ach-tlv-01.txt>

    The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) is a generalization of
       the applicability of the Pseudowire (PW) Associated Channel Header
       (ACH).  RFC 5586 defines the concept of TLV constructs that can be
       carried in messages on the G-ACh by placing them in the ACH between
       the fixed header fields and the G-ACh message.  These TLVs are called
       ACH TLVs
    
       No Associated Channel Type yet defined uses an ACH TLV.  Furthermore,
       it is believed that handling TLVs in hardware introduces significant
       problems to the fast-path, and since G-ACh messages are intended to
       be processed substantially in hardware, the use of ACH TLVs is
       undesirable.
    
       This document updates RFC 5586 by retiring ACH TLVs and removing the
       associated registry.

  "Hub and Spoke Multipoint Label Switched Path Tunnels", Lizhong Jin,
  Frederic JOUNAY, Manav Bhatia, Sriganesh Kini, 3-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-rsvp-te-hsmp-lsp-00.txt>

    There are applications that require bi-directional, co-routed and
       guaranteed communication from a root node to several leaf nodes in a
       hub and spoke fashion.  To meet such application requirements in a
       Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network this draft defines a
       Hub and Spoke Multipoint Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (HSMP
       TE LSP) with resource reservations for guaranteed communication.
       This draft also defines a protocol to setup such LSPs by re-using and
       extending P2MP RSVP-TE.

Multicast Mobility (multimob)
-----------------------------

  "Mobile Multicast Sender Support in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) Domains",
  Thomas Schmidt, Shuai Gao, Hong-Ke Zhang, Matthias Waehlisch, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-multimob-pmipv6-source-03.txt>

    Multicast communication can be enabled in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains
       via the Local Mobility Anchors by deploying MLD Proxy functions at
       Mobile Access Gateways, via a direct traffic distribution within an
       ISP's access network, or by selective route optimization schemes.
       This document describes the support of mobile multicast senders in
       Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains for all three scenarios.  Protocol
       optimizations for synchronizing PMIPv6 with PIM, as well as extended
       MLD Proxy functions are presented.  Mobile sources always remain
       agnostic of multicast mobility operations.

  "Multicast Mobility Routing Optimizations for Proxy Mobile IPv6", Juan
  Zuniga, Luis Contreras, Carlos Bernardos, Seil Jeon, Younghan Kim,
  18-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-multimob-pmipv6-ropt-06.txt>

    A base solution to support IP multicasting in a PMIPv6 domain is
       specified in [RFC6224].  In this document, some enhancements to the
       base solution are described.  These enhancements include the use of a
       multicast tree mobility anchor as the topological anchor point for
       multicast traffic, as well as a direct routing option where the MAG
       can provide access to multicast content in the local network.  These
       enhancements provide benefits such as reducing multicast traffic
       replication and supporting different PMIPv6 deployment scenarios.

  "PMIPv6 multicast handover optimization by the Subscription Information
  Acquisition through the LMA (SIAL)", Luis Contreras, Carlos Bernardos,
  Ignacio Soto, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-multimob-handover-optimization-02.txt>

    This document specifies a multicast handover optimization mechanism
       for Proxy Mobile IPv6 to accelerate the delivery of multicast traffic
       to mobile nodes after handovers.  The mechanism is based on speeding
       up the acquisition of mobile nodes' multicast context by the mobile
       access gateways.  To do that, extensions to the current Proxy Mobile
       IPv6 protocol are proposed.  These extensions are not only applicable
       to the base solution for multicast support in Proxy Mobile IPv6, but
       they can also be applied to other solutions being developed to avoid
       the tunnel convergence problem.  Furthermore, they are also
       independent of the role played by the mobile access gateway within
       the multicast network (either acting as multicast listener discovery
       proxy or multicast router).

  "Multicast Listener Extensions for MIPv6 and PMIPv6 Fast Handovers",
  Thomas Schmidt, Matthias Waehlisch, Rajeev Koodli, Gorry Fairhurst,
  Dapeng Liu, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-multimob-fmipv6-pfmipv6-multicast-01.txt>

    Fast handover protocols for MIPv6 and PMIPv6 define mobility
       management procedures that support unicast communication at reduced
       handover latency.  Fast handover base operations do not affect
       multicast communication, and hence do not accelerate handover
       management for native multicast listeners.  Many multicast
       applications like IPTV or conferencing, though, are comprised of
       delay-sensitive real-time traffic and will benefit from fast handover
       execution.  This document specifies extension of the Mobile IPv6 Fast
       Handovers (FMIPv6) and the Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6
       (PFMIPv6) protocols to include multicast traffic management in fast
       handover operations.  This multicast support is provided first at the
       control plane by a management of rapid context transfer between
       access routers, second at the data plane by an optional fast traffic
       forwarding that may include buffering.

Network Endpoint Assessment (nea)
---------------------------------

  "PT-EAP: Posture Transport (PT) Protocol For EAP Tunnel Methods", Nancy
  Cam-Winget, Paul Sangster, 28-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-nea-pt-eap-09.txt>

    This document specifies PT-EAP, an Extensible Authentication Protocol
       (EAP) based Posture Transport (PT) protocol designed to be used only
       inside a TLS protected EAP tunnel method.  The document also
       describes the intended applicability of PT-EAP.

Network Configuration (netconf)
-------------------------------

  "Using the NETCONF Protocol over Transport Layer Security (TLS)",
  Mohamad Badra, Alan Luchuk, Juergen Schoenwaelder, 10-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-netconf-rfc5539bis-03.txt>

    The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to
       install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices.
       This document describes how to use the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
       protocol to secure the exchange of NETCONF messages.  This document
       obsoletes RFC 5539.

  "Reverse Secure Shell (Reverse SSH)", Kent Watsen, 21-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-netconf-reverse-ssh-01.txt>

    This memo presents a technique for a NETCONF server to initiate a SSH
       connection to a NETCONF client.  This is accomplished by the NETCONF
       client listening on IANA-assigned TCP port YYYY and starting the SSH
       client protocol immediately after accepting a TCP connection on it.
       This role-reversal is necessary as the NETCONF server must also be
       the SSH Server, in order for the NETCONF client to open the IANA-
       assigned SSH subsystem "netconf".

Network-Based Mobility Extensions (netext)
------------------------------------------

  "Logical Interface Support for multi-mode IP Hosts", Telemaco Melia, Sri
  Gundavelli, 24-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-netext-logical-interface-support-07.txt>

    A Logical Interface is a software semantic internal to the host
       operating system.  This semantic is available in all popular
       operating systems and is used in various protocol implementations.
       The Logical Interface support is required on the mobile node
       operating in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, for leveraging various
       network-based mobility management features such as inter-technology
       handoffs, multihoming and flow mobility support.  This document
       explains the operational details of Logical Interface construct and
       the specifics on how the link-layer implementations hide the physical
       interfaces from the IP stack and from the network nodes on the
       attached access networks.  Furthermore, this document identifies the
       applicability of this approach to various link-layer technologies and
       analyzes the issues around it when used in context with various
       mobility management features.

  "Prefix Delegation Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6", Xingyue Zhou, Jouni
  Korhonen, Carl Williams, Sri Gundavelli, Carlos Bernardos, 18-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-netext-pd-pmip-09.txt>

    This specification defines extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol
       for allowing a mobile router in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to obtain
       delegated IP prefixes for its attached mobile networks.  The mobility
       entities in the network will provide network-based mobility
       management support for those delegated IP prefixes just as how IP
       mobility support is provided for the mobile node's home address.
       Even as the mobile router performs a handoff and changes its network
       point of attachment, mobility support is ensured for all the
       delegated IP prefixes and for all the IP nodes in the mobile network
       that use IP address configuration from those delegated IP prefixes.

  "Proxy Mobile IPv6 Extensions to Support Flow Mobility", Carlos
  Bernardos, 25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-netext-pmipv6-flowmob-06.txt>

    Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node to connect to the same Proxy
       Mobile IPv6 domain through different interfaces.  However, the
       ability of movement of selected flows from one access technology to
       another is missing in the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol.  This
       document describes extensions to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol that
       are required to support network based flow mobility over multiple
       physical interfaces.
    
       The extensions required consist on the operations performed by the
       local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway to manage the
       prefixes assigned to the different interfaces of the mobile node, as
       well as how the forwarding policies are handled by the network to
       ensure consistent flow mobility management.

  "EAP Attributes for WiFi - EPC Integration", Ravi Valmikam, Rajeev
  Koodli, 15-Jan-13, <draft-ietf-netext-wifi-epc-eap-attributes-02.txt>

    With WiFi beginning to establishing itself as a trusted access
       network for service providers, it has become important to provide
       functions commonly available in 3G and 4G networks in WiFi access
       networks.  Such functions include Access Point Name (APN) Selection,
       multiple Packet Data Network (PDN) connections and seamless mobility
       between WiFi and 3G/4G networks.
    
       EAP/AKA (and EAP/AKA') is standardized by 3GPP as the access
       authentication protocol for trusted access networks.  This IETF
       specification is required for mobile devices to access the 3GPP
       Evolved Packet Core (EPC) networks.  This document defines a few new
       EAP attributes and procedures to provide the above-mentioned
       functions in trusted WiFi access networks.

  "Quality of Service Option for Proxy Mobile IPv6", Marco Liebsch,
  Pierrick Seite, Hidetoshi Yokota, Jouni Korhonen, Sri Gundavelli,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-netext-pmip6-qos-02.txt>

    This specification defines a new mobility option that can be used by
       the mobility entities in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to exchange
       Quality of Service parameters associated with a subscriber's IP
       flows.  Using the QoS option, the local mobility anchor and the
       mobile access gateway can exchange available QoS attributes and
       associated values.  This enables QoS policing and labeling of packets
       to enforce QoS differentiation on the path between the local mobility
       anchor and the mobile access gateway.  Furthermore, making QoS
       parameters available on the MAG enables mapping these parameters to
       QoS rules being specific to the access technology which operates
       below the mobile access gateway.  After such mapping, QoS rules can
       be enforced on the access technology components, such as an IEEE
       802.11e Wireless LAN controller.

  "Update Notifications for Proxy Mobile IPv6", Suresh Krishnan, Sri
  Gundavelli, Marco Liebsch, Hidetoshi Yokota, Jouni Korhonen, 17-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-netext-update-notifications-05.txt>

    This document specifies protocol enhancements for allowing the local
       mobility anchor in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to asynchronously
       notify the mobile access gateway about changes related to a mobility
       session.  These update notification messages are exchanged using a
       new Mobility Header message type specifically designed for this
       purpose.

NETCONF Data Modeling Language (netmod)
---------------------------------------

  "IANA Interface Type and Address Family YANG Modules", Martin Bjorklund,

       iana-afn-safi YANG modules.

  "A YANG Data Model for Interface Management", Martin Bjorklund,
  15-May-13, <draft-ietf-netmod-interfaces-cfg-11.txt>

    This document defines a YANG data model for the management of network
       interfaces.  It is expected that interface type specific data models
       augment the generic interfaces data model defined in this document.
       The data model includes configuration data, state data and counters
       for the collection of statistics.

  "A YANG Data Model for Routing Management", Ladislav Lhotka, 23-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-netmod-routing-cfg-09.txt>

    This document contains a specification of three YANG modules.
       Together they form the core routing data model which serves as a
       framework for configuring and managing a routing subsystem.  It is
       expected that these modules will be augmented by additional YANG
       modules defining data models for individual routing protocols and
       other related functions.  The core routing data model provides common
       building blocks for such extensions - router instances, routes,
       routing tables, routing protocols and route filters.

  "A YANG Data Model for IP Management", Martin Bjorklund, 10-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-netmod-ip-cfg-09.txt>

       implementations.

  "YANG Data Model for System Management", Andy Bierman, Martin Bjorklund,
  17-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-netmod-system-mgmt-07.txt>

    This document defines a YANG data model for the configuration and
       identification of some common system properties within a device
       containing a NETCONF server.  This includes data node definitions for
       system identification, time-of-day management, user management, DNS
       resolver configuration, and some protocol operations for system
       management.

  "A YANG Data Model for SNMP Configuration", Martin Bjorklund, Juergen

  Daniel Ellard, Renu Tewari, Charles Lever, 12-Dec-12,
  <draft-ietf-nfsv4-federated-fs-admin-15.txt>

    This document describes the administration protocol for a federated
       file system that enables file access and namespace traversal across
       collections of independently administered fileservers.  The protocol
       specifies a set of interfaces by which fileservers with different
       administrators can form a fileserver federation that provides a
       namespace composed of the filesystems physically hosted on and
       exported by the constituent fileservers.

       fileservers.

  "Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Protocol", Tom, David Noveck,
  8-May-13, <draft-ietf-nfsv4-rfc3530bis-26.txt>

    The Network File System (NFS) version 4 is a distributed filesystem
       protocol which owes heritage to NFS protocol version 2, RFC 1094, and
       version 3, RFC 1813.  Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4
       protocol supports traditional file access while integrating support
       for file locking and the mount protocol.  In addition, support for
       strong security (and its negotiation), compound operations, client
       caching, and internationalization have been added.  Of course,
       attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an
       Internet environment.
    
       This document, together with the companion XDR description document,
       RFCNFSv4XDR, obsoletes RFC 3530 as the definition of the NFS version
       4 protocol.

  "Network File System (NFS) Version 4 External Data Representation

  "NFSv4 migration: Implementation experience and spec issues to resolve",
  David Noveck, Piyush Shivam, Charles Lever, Bill Baker, 21-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-nfsv4-migration-issues-03.txt>

    The migration feature of NFSv4 provides for moving responsibility for
       a single filesystem from one server to another, without disruption to
       clients.  Recent implementation experience has shown problems in the
       existing specification for this feature.  This document discusses the
       issues which have arisen, explores the options available for curing
       the issues, and explains the choices made in updating the NFSv4.0 and
       NFSv4.1 specifications, to address migration.

  "NFSv4.0 migration: Specification Update", David Noveck, Piyush Shivam,
  Charles Lever, Bill Baker, 15-Feb-13,

    The migration feature of NFSv4 allows for responsibility for a single
       filesystem to move from one server to another, without disruption to
       clients.  Recent implementation experience has shown problems in the
       existing specification for this feature in NFSv4.0.  This document
       clarifies and corrects the NFSv4.0 specification (RFC3530 and
       possible successors) to address these problems.

Individual Submissions (none)

  "The ARK Identifier Scheme", John Kunze, R. Rodgers, 5-Apr-13,
  <draft-kunze-ark-18.txt>

    The ARK (Archival Resource Key) naming scheme is designed to
    facilitate the high-quality and persistent identification of
    information objects.  A founding principle of the ARK is that
    persistence is purely a matter of service and is neither inherent in
    an object nor conferred on it by a particular naming syntax.  The
    best that an identifier can do is to lead users to the services that
    support robust reference.  The term ARK itself refers both to the
    scheme and to any single identifier that conforms to it.  An ARK has
    five components:
    
    [http://NMAH/]ark:/NAAN/Name[Qualifier]
    
    an optional and mutable Name Mapping Authority Hostport (usually a
    hostname), the "ark:" label, the Name Assigning Authority Number
    (NAAN), the assigned Name, and an optional and possibly mutable
    Qualifier supported by the NMA.  The NAAN and Name together form the
    immutable persistent identifier for the object independent of the URL
    hostname.  An ARK is a special kind of URL that connects users to
    three things: the named object, its metadata, and the provider's
    promise about its persistence.  When entered into the location field
    of a Web browser, the ARK leads the user to the named object.  That
    same ARK, inflected by appending a single question mark (`?'),
    returns a brief metadata record that is both human- and machine-
    readable.  When the ARK is inflected by appending dual question marks
    (`??'), the returned metadata contains a commitment statement from
    the current provider.  Tools exist for minting, binding, and
    resolving ARKs.

    events.

  "Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Packet Drop Reporting",
  Randall Stewart, Peter Lei, Michael Tuexen, 17-Apr-13,
  <draft-stewart-sctp-pktdrprep-15.txt>

    This document describes a new chunk type for SCTP.  This new chunk
       type can be used by both endhosts and routers to report the loss of
       SCTP datagrams due to errors in transmission or other drops not due
       to congestion.

  "Applicability of Reliable Server Pooling for Real-Time Distributed
  Computing", Thomas Dreibholz, 31-Dec-12,
  <draft-dreibholz-rserpool-applic-distcomp-14.txt>

    This document describes the applicability of the Reliable Server
       Pooling architecture to manage real-time distributed computing pools
       and access the resources of such pools.

  "Secure SCTP", Carsten Hohendorf, Esbold Unurkhaan, Thomas Dreibholz,
  31-Dec-12, <draft-hohendorf-secure-sctp-15.txt>

    This document explains the reason for the integration of security
       functionality into SCTP, and gives a short description of S-SCTP and
       its services.  S-SCTP is fully compatible with SCTP defined in
       RFC4960, it is designed to integrate cryptographic functions into
       SCTP.

  "Operational Reliability for EDIINT AS2", John Duker, Dale Moberg,
  17-Apr-13, <draft-duker-as2-reliability-13.txt>

    One goal of this document is to define approaches to achieve a "once
    and only once" delivery of messages. The EDIINT AS2 protocol [AS2] is
    implemented by a number of software tools on a variety of platforms
    with varying capabilities and with varying network service quality.
    Although the AS2 protocol defines a unique "Message-ID", current
    implementations of AS2 do not provide a standard method to prevent
    the same message (re-transmitted by the initial sender) from reaching
    back-end business applications at the initial receiver.
    
    A second goal is to reduce retransmissions and failures when AS2 is used
    in a synchronous mode for transmitting MDNs.  There can be a large
    latency between receipt of the POSTed entity body and the MDN response
    caused by the operations of decompressing, decrypting, and signature
    checks. Uncoordinated timeout policies and intermediate devices dropping
    connections have interfered with reliable data exchange. The use of an
    HTTP 102(Processing) status code is described to mitigate these
    difficulties. Use of these reliability features is indicated by
    presence of the "AS2-Reliability" value in the EDIINT-Features header.
    
    Intended Status
    
    The intent of this document is to be placed on the RFC track as an
    Informational RFC.

  "Private Header (P-Header) Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP) for the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)", Keith Drage,
  Christer Holmberg, Roland Jesske, 15-Mar-13,
  <draft-drage-sipping-rfc3455bis-08.txt>

    This document describes a set of private Session Initiation Protocol
       (SIP) header fields (P-headers) used by the 3rd-Generation
       Partnership Project (3GPP), along with their applicability, which is
       limited to particular environments.  The P-header fields are for a
       variety of purposes within the networks that the partners use,
       including charging and information about the networks a call
       traverses.

  "Applicability of Reliable Server Pooling for SCTP-Based Endpoint
  Mobility", Thomas Dreibholz, Jobin Pulinthanath, 31-Dec-12,
  <draft-dreibholz-rserpool-applic-mobility-13.txt>

    This document describes a novel mobility concept based on a
       combination of SCTP with Dynamic Address Reconfiguration extension
       and Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool).

  "Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) Bakeoff Scoring", Thomas Dreibholz,
  Michael Tuexen, 31-Dec-12, <draft-dreibholz-rserpool-score-12.txt>

    This memo describes some of the scoring to be used in the testing of
       Reliable Server Pooling protocols ASAP and ENRP at upcoming bakeoffs.

  "Distributed DNS Implementation in IpV6", Lican Huang, 30-Jan-13,
  <draft-licanhuang-dnsop-distributeddns-13.txt>

    This file is a proposal for P2P based Domain Name query strategy in
    IpV6.  The DNS servers construct n-tuple overlay virtual hierarchical
    overlay network.  With cached addresses of DNS servers, the overload of
    traffic in tree structure can be avoided and more security can be
    enhanced due to the random lookup paths. This strategy may use for
    Domain Name query and reverse Domain Name query in IpV6 for a large
    number of domain names.

  "Using Saratoga with a Bundle Agent as a Convergence Layer for Delay-
  Tolerant Networking", Lloyd Wood, Jim McKim, Wesley Eddy, Will Ivancic,
  Chris Jackson, 21-Apr-13, <draft-wood-dtnrg-saratoga-12.txt>

    Saratoga is a simple, lightweight, UDP-based transfer protocol.  This
       describes how to use Saratoga as a Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN)
       "convergence layer" with the Bundle Protocol and its Bundle Agents,
       building on the Saratoga specification in draft-wood-tsvwg-saratoga.

  "Handle Resolution Option for ASAP", Thomas Dreibholz, 31-Dec-12,
  <draft-dreibholz-rserpool-asap-hropt-12.txt>

    This document describes the Handle Resolution option for the ASAP
       protocol.

  "Definition of a Delay Measurement Infrastructure and Delay-Sensitive
  Least-Used Policy for Reliable Server Pooling", Thomas Dreibholz, Xing
  Zhou, 31-Dec-12, <draft-dreibholz-rserpool-delay-11.txt>

    This document contains the definition of a delay measurement
       infrastructure and a delay-sensitive Least-Used policy for Reliable
       Server Pooling.

  "The Lightweight Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Support
  Protocol (LGSP)", Carlo Kopp, Mike Tyson, 21-Dec-07,
  <draft-tyson-lgsp-01.txt>

    This document presents the Lightweight GNSS (Global Navigation
    Satellite System) Support Protocol (LGSP).  The Lightweight GNSS
    Support Protocol (LGSP) is being developed in order to provide a
    comprehensive solution which solves the problems inherent in
    traditional radio-based Differential GPS (DGPS) protocols.  LGSP will
    also provide additional support for GNSS user equipment, such as a
    GPS almanac retrieval method, allowing compatible units to perform
    faster almanac acquisition, thus resulting in less time until an
    initial position measurement can be established.  Other supporting
    features include alternative distribution of GPS navigation messages
    and differential correction messages, a hierarchical mirroring
    architecture, redundant backup operation and load balancing
    functions.

  "Saratoga: A Scalable Data Transfer Protocol", Lloyd Wood, Wesley Eddy,
  Charles Smith, Will Ivancic, Chris Jackson, 21-Apr-13,
  <draft-wood-tsvwg-saratoga-13.txt>

    This document specifies the Saratoga transfer protocol.  Saratoga was
       originally developed to transfer remote-sensing imagery efficiently
       from a low-Earth-orbiting satellite constellation, but is useful for
       many other scenarios, including ad-hoc peer-to-peer communications,
       delay-tolerant networking, and grid computing.  Saratoga is a simple,
       lightweight, content dissemination protocol that builds on UDP, and
       optionally uses UDP-Lite.  Saratoga is intended for use when moving
       files or streaming data between peers which may have permanent,
       sporadic or intermittent connectivity, and is capable of transferring
       very large amounts of data reliably under adverse conditions.  The
       Saratoga protocol is designed to cope with highly asymmetric link or
       path capacity between peers, and can support fully-unidirectional
       data transfer if required.  Saratoga can also cope with very large
       files for exascale computing.  In scenarios with dedicated links,
       Saratoga focuses on high link utilization to make the most of limited
       connectivity times, while standard congestion control mechanisms can
       be implemented for operation over shared links.  Loss recovery is
       implemented via a simple negative-ack ARQ mechanism.  The protocol
       specified in this document is considered to be appropriate for
       experimental use on private IP networks.

  "Session Initiation Protocol Service Example -- Music on Hold", Dale
  Worley, 16-Apr-13, <draft-worley-service-example-12.txt>

    The "music on hold" feature is one of the most desired features of
       telephone systems in the business environment.  "Music on hold" is
       where, when one party to a call has the call "on hold", that party's
       telephone provides an audio stream (often music) to be heard by the
       other party.  Architectural features of SIP make it difficult to
       implement music-on-hold in a way that is fully compliant with the
       standards.  The implementation of music-on-hold described in this
       document is fully effective and standards-compliant, and has a number
       of advantages over the methods previously documented.  In particular,
       it is less likely to produce peculiar user interface effects and more
       likely to work in systems which perform authentication than the
       music-on-hold method described in section 2.3 of RFC 5359.

  "Interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
  Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): One-to-One Text
  Chat", Peter Saint-Andre, Salvatore Loreto, Eddy Gavita, Nazin Hossain,
  13-Jun-13, <draft-saintandre-sip-xmpp-chat-06.txt>

    This document defines a bidirectional protocol mapping for the
       exchange of instant messages in the context of a one-to-one chat
       session between a user of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and a
       user of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).
       Specifically for SIP text chat, this document specifies a mapping to
       the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP).

  "Interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
  Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Addresses and Error
  Conditions", Peter Saint-Andre, Avshalom Houri, Joe Hildebrand,
  13-Jun-13, <draft-saintandre-sip-xmpp-core-05.txt>

    As a foundation for the definition of bidirectional protocol mappings
       between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible
       Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), this document specifies the
       architectural assumptions underlying such mappings as well as the
       mapping of addresses and error conditions.

  "Interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
  Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant Messaging",
  Peter Saint-Andre, Avshalom Houri, Joe Hildebrand, 4-Apr-13,
  <draft-saintandre-sip-xmpp-im-03.txt>

    This document defines a bidirectional protocol mapping for the
       exchange of single instant messages between the Session Initiation
       Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
       (XMPP).

  "Interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
  Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Media Sessions",
  Peter Saint-Andre, 20-Feb-13, <draft-saintandre-sip-xmpp-media-02.txt>

    This document defines a bi-directional protocol mapping for use by
       gateways that enable the exchange of media signalling messages
       between systems that implement the Jingle extensions to the
       Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) and those that
       implement the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

  "Interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
  Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Presence", Peter
  Saint-Andre, Avshalom Houri, Joe Hildebrand, 2-Apr-13,
  <draft-saintandre-sip-xmpp-presence-05.txt>

    This document defines a bi-directional protocol mapping for the
       exchange of presence information between the Session Initiation
       Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
       (XMPP).

  "The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) DNS Resource Record", Patrik
  Faltstrom, Olaf Kolkman, 22-Jan-13, <draft-faltstrom-uri-07.txt>

    This document defines a new DNS resource record, called the Uniform
       Resource Identifier (URI) RR, for publishing mappings from hostnames
       to URIs.
    
       This document updates RFC 3958 and RFC 3404.

  "6LoWPAN Backbone Router", Pascal Thubert, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-thubert-6lowpan-backbone-router-03.txt>

    Some LLN subnets are expected to scale up to the thousands of nodes
       and hundreds of routers.  This paper proposes an IPv6 version of the
       Backbone Router concept that enables such a degree of scalability
       using a high speed network as a backbone to the subnet.

  "The BagIt File Packaging Format (V0.97)", Andy Boyko, John Kunze,
  Justin Littman, Liz Madden, Brian Vargas, 5-Apr-13,
  <draft-kunze-bagit-09.txt>

    This document specifies BagIt, a hierarchical file packaging format
       for storage and transfer of arbitrary digital content.  A "bag" has
       just enough structure to enclose descriptive "tags" and a "payload"
       but does not require knowledge of the payload's internal semantics.
       This BagIt format should be suitable for disk-based or network-based
       storage and transfer.

  "PCEP extensions for a BGP/MPLS IP-VPN", Kenji Kumaki, Tomoki Murai,
  Dhruv Dhody, PENG JIANG, 26-Apr-13,
  <draft-kumaki-murai-pce-pcep-extension-l3vpn-11.txt>

    IP Virtual Private Networks (IP-VPNs) allow Service Providers to
       offer customers connectivity between sites across an IP Backbone.
       These VPNs can be supported using BGP/MPLS and the connections can be
       created by using MPLS Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switched Paths
       (LSPs). The paths of these LSPs must be computed to provide the
       connectivity between customer sites. Path selection may be dependent
       on a variety of factors including traffic engineering constraints
       and bandwidth requirements.
    
       It is highly desirable for VPN customers to be able to dynamically
       establish their MPLS TE LSPs for interconnectivity between BGP/MPLS
       IP-VPN sites. The Path Computation Element (PCE) can determine the
       optimal paths of TE LSPs within an MPLS network. This document
       defines how to extend the PCEP to support the dynamic creation of
       MPLS TE LSPs between BGP/MPLS IP-VPN sites.

  "Labels for Common Location-Based Services", Andrea Forte, Henning
  Schulzrinne, 15-Jan-10,
  <draft-forte-ecrit-service-classification-03.txt>

    This document creates a registry for describing the types of services
    available at a specific location.  The registry is expected to be
    referenced by other protocols that need a common set of service terms   as protocol constants.  In particular, we define location-based
    service as either a point at a specific geographic location (e.g.,
    bus stop) or a service covering a specific region (e.g., pizza
    delivery).

  "BGP Extended Community for QoS Marking", Thomas Knoll, 4-Jan-13,
  <draft-knoll-idr-qos-attribute-11.txt>

    This document specifies a simple signalling mechanism for inter-
       domain QoS marking using several instances of a new BGP Extended
       Community.  Class based packet marking and forwarding is currently
       performed independently within ASes.  The new QoS marking community
       makes the targeted Per Hop Behaviour within the IP prefix advertising
       AS and the currently applied marking at the interconnection point
       known to all access and transit ASes.  This enables individual
       (re-)marking and possibly forwarding treatment adaptation to the
       original QoS class setup of the respective originating AS.  The
       extended community provides the means to signal QoS markings on
       different layers, which are linked together in QoS Class Sets.  It
       provides inter-domain and cross-layer insight into the QoS class
       mapping of the source AS with minimal signalling traffic.

  "BGP Class of Service Interconnection", Thomas Knoll, 11-May-13,
  <draft-knoll-idr-cos-interconnect-10.txt>

    This document focuses on Class of Service Interconnection at inter-
       domain interconnection points.  It specifies two new transitive
       attributes, which enable adjacent peers to signal Class of Service
       Capabilities and certain Class of Service admission control
       Parameters.  The new "CoS Capability" is deliberately kept simple and
       denotes the general EF, AF Group BE and LE forwarding support across
       the advertising AS.  The second "CoS Parameter Attribute" is of
       variable length and contains a more detailed description of available
       forwarding behaviours using the PHB id Code encoding.  Each PHB id
       Code is associated with rate and size based traffic parameters, which
       will be applied in the ingress AS Border Router for admission control
       purposes to a given forwarding behaviour.

  "Internet Protocol-based In-Vehicle Emergency Call", Brian Rosen, Hannes
  Tschofenig, Randy, 24-Feb-13, <draft-rosen-ecrit-ecall-08.txt>

    This document describes how to re-use the emergency services
       mechanisms specified for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to
       accomplishing emergency calling support in vehicles.  Profiling and
       simplifications are possible due to the nature of the functionality
       that is going to be provided in vehicles with the usage of Global
       Positioning System (GPS).

  "RSVP-TE Recovery Extension for data plane initiated reversion,
  protection timer and SNC options signalling", Attila Takacs, Francesco
  Fondelli, Benoit Tremblay, Zafar Ali, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-takacs-ccamp-revertive-ps-08.txt>

    RSVP-TE recovery extensions are specified in [RFC4872] and
       [RFC4873].  Currently recovery signalling does not support the
       request for revertive protection, recovery timers values, and
       sub-network connection (SNC) protection options. This document
       extends the PROTECTION Object format allowing sub-TLVs, and
       defines three sub-TLVs to carry wait-to-restore and hold-off
       intervals and SNC protection options.

  "Definitions of Textual Conventions (TCs) for Multiprotocol Label
  Switching (MPLS) Management", Vishwas Manral, Tina Tsou, Will Liu,
  21-May-13, <draft-manral-mpls-rfc3811bis-02.txt>

    This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module which
       contains Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Multiprotocol
       Label Switching (MPLS) management information.  The intent is that
       these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in MPLS
       related MIB modules that would otherwise define their own
       representations.
    
       This document obsoletes RFC3811 as it addresses the need to support
       IPv6 extended TunnelID's by defining a new TC-
       MplsNewExtendedTunnelID which suggests using IPv4 address of the
       ingress or egress LSR for the tunnel for an IPv6 network.  Changes
       from RFC3811 and the effect of the new TC to other related documents
       are summarized in Section 4 and 5, respectively.

  "Fast Connectivity Restoration Using BGP Add-path", Pradosh Mohapatra,
  Rex Fernando, Clarence Filsfils, Robert Raszuk, 22-Jan-13,
  <draft-pmohapat-idr-fast-conn-restore-03.txt>

    A BGP route defines an association of an address prefix with an "exit
       point" from the current Autonomous System (AS).  If the exit point
       becomes unreachable due to a failure, the route becomes invalid.
       This usually triggers an exchange of BGP control messages after which
       a new BGP route for the given prefix is installed.  However,
       connectivity can be restored more quickly if the router maintains
       precomputed BGP backup routes.  It can then switch to a backup route
       immediately upon learning that an exit point is unreachable, without
       needing to wait for the BGP control messages exchange.  This document
       specifies the procedures to be used by BGP to maintain and distribute
       the precomputed backup routes.  Maintaining these additional routes
       is also useful in promoting load balancing, performing maintenance
       without causing traffic loss, and in reducing churn in the BGP
       control plane.

  "Healthy Food and Special Dietary Requirements for IETF meetings", Mary
  Barnes, 25-Feb-13, <draft-barnes-healthy-food-06.txt>

    This document describes the basic requirements for food for folks
       that attend IETF meetings require special diets, as well as those
       that prefer to eat healthy.  While, the variety of special diets is
       quite broad, the most general categories are described.  There can be
       controversy as to what constitutes healthy eating, but there are some
       common, generally available foods that comprise the basis for healthy
       eating and special diets.  This document provides some
       recommendations to meeting planners, as well as participants, in
       handling these requirements.

  "Information Model for Impaired Optical Path Validation", Young Lee,
  Greg Bernstein, Xian Zhang, 20-Feb-13,
  <draft-bernstein-wson-impairment-info-06.txt>

    This document provides an information model for the optical
       impairment characteristics of optical network elements for use in
       GMPLS/PCE control plane protocols and mechanisms. This information
       model supports Impairment Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment
       (IA-RWA) in optical networks in which path computation and optical
       path validation are essential components. This is not a general
       network management information model.
    
       This model is based on ITU-T defined optical network element
       characteristics as given in ITU-T recommendation G.680 and related
       specifications. This model is intentionally compatible with a
       previous impairment free optical information model used in optical
       path computations and wavelength assignment.

  "Interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
  Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Groupchat", Peter
  Saint-Andre, Saul Corretge, Salvatore Loreto, 20-Jun-13,
  <draft-saintandre-sip-xmpp-groupchat-04.txt>

    This document defines a bidirectional protocol mapping for the
       exchange of instant messages in the context of a multiparty chat
       session among users of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and
       users of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).
       Specifically, this document defines a mapping between the SIP-based
       Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) and the XMPP Multi-User Chat
       (MUC) extension.

  "Extreme Networks' Ethernet Automatic Protection Switching (EAPS),
  Version 1.3", Arnel Lim, Steven Blake, Sunil Shah, 5-Jul-11,
  <draft-shah-extreme-rfc3619bis-02.txt>

    This document describes version 1.3 of the Ethernet Automatic
    Protection Switching (EAPS) (TM) technology invented by Extreme
    Networks to increase the availability and robustness of Ethernet
    rings.  An Ethernet ring built using EAPS can have resilience
    comparable to that provided by SONET rings, at lower cost and without
    some of the constraints (e.g. ring size) of SONET.

  "Takeover Suggestion Flag for the ENRP Handle Update Message", Thomas
  Dreibholz, Xing Zhou, 31-Dec-12,
  <draft-dreibholz-rserpool-enrp-takeover-09.txt>

    This document describes the Takeover Suggestion Flag for the
       ENRP_HANDLE_UPDATE message of the ENRP protocol.

  "Information Encoding for Impaired Optical Path Validation", Greg
  Bernstein, Young Lee, Xian Zhang, 21-Feb-13,
  <draft-bernstein-wson-impairment-encode-02.txt>

    This document provides an information encoding for the optical
       impairment characteristics of optical network elements for use in
       path computation and optical path impairment validation. This
       encoding is based on ITU-T defined optical network element
       characteristics as given in ITU-T recommendation G.680 and related
       specifications. This encoding is intentionally compatible with a
       previous impairment free optical information encoding used in
       optical path computations and wavelength assignment.

  "The Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL)", Fred
  Templin, 12-Jun-13, <draft-templin-intarea-seal-57.txt>

    This document specifies a Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation
       Layer (SEAL).  SEAL operates over virtual topologies configured over
       connected IP network routing regions bounded by encapsulating border
       nodes.  These virtual topologies are manifested by tunnels that may
       span multiple IP and/or sub-IP layer forwarding hops, where they may
       incur packet duplication, packet reordering, source address spoofing
       and traversal of links with diverse Maximum Transmission Units
       (MTUs).  SEAL addresses these issues through the encapsulation and
       messaging mechanisms specified in this document.

  "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Communication
  Diversion Information in support of the Communication Diversion (CDIV)
  Notification (CDIVN) CDIV service", John-Luc Bakker, Ranjit Avasarala,
  24-Mar-13, <draft-avasarala-dispatch-comm-div-notification-11.txt>

    3GPP and TISPAN are defining the protocol specification for the
       Communication Diversion (CDIV) service using IP Multimedia (IM) Core
       Network (CN) subsystem (IMS) supplementary service.  As part of CDIV,
       a SIP based event package is used for notifying users about
       diversions (re-directions or forwarding) of requests for
       communication sessions targetting the user.  This document defines
       the SIP event package to support subscription and notification of
       diversions.  The proposed event package is applicable to the CDIV
       supplementary service in IMS and may not be applicable to the general
       internet.

  "Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET)", Fred Templin, 3-May-13,
  <draft-templin-intarea-vet-40.txt>

    Enterprise networks connect hosts and routers over various link
       types, and often also connect to the global Internet either directly
       or via a provider network.  Enterprise network nodes require a means
       to automatically provision addresses/prefixes and support
       internetworking operation in a wide variety of use cases including
       Small Office / Home Office (SOHO) networks, Mobile Ad hoc Networks
       (MANETs), ISP networks, multi-organizational corporate networks and
       the interdomain core of the global Internet itself.  This document
       specifies a Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET) abstraction for
       autoconfiguration and operation of nodes in dynamic enterprise
       networks.

  "Reverse DNS in IPv6 for Internet Service Providers", Lee Howard,
  26-Mar-13, <draft-howard-isp-ip6rdns-06.txt>

    In IPv4, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) commonly provide IN-
       ADDR.ARPA. information for their customers by prepopulating the zone
       with one PTR record for every available address.  This practice does
       not scale in IPv6.  This document analyzes different approaches for
       ISPs to manage the ip6.arpa zone for IPv6 address space assigned to
       many customers.

  "The atypes media feature tag for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)",
  Mohamed Boucadair, Andrew Allen, 11-Jun-13,
  <draft-boucadair-dispatch-ipv6-atypes-01.txt>

    This specification defines a new media feature tag called atypes.
       This new media feature tag indicates the IP address type capabilities
       of the UA (User Agent) and can aid the routing process and ease the
       invocation of required functions when heterogeneous (i.e., IPv4 and
       IPv6) parties are involved in a given SIP session.
    
       This specification solves a problem raised in 3GPP TS 24.229
       [TS.24229].

  "PIM-SM DR Priority Auto-Adjustment", Xiaohu Xu, Temple Steps, Rajiv
  Asati, SEZ Unit, 3-Jun-13,
  <draft-xu-pim-drpriority-auto-adjustment-04.txt>

    This document defines some mechanisms for automatically adjusting the
       Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Designed Router (DR) priority
       according to the status of the tracked interface. This approach can
       be used to realize DR auto-switchover in case the DR loses the route
       to multicast source or Rendezvous Point (RP).

  "Session Policy Framework using EAP", Stephen McCann, Michael
  Montemurro, 8-Jan-13,
  <draft-mccann-session-policy-framework-using-eap-07.txt>

    This document specifies a framework for implementing a session policy
       channel using EAP. It defines a standard mechanism by which a mobile
       device can conduct a session policy exchange with a policy network
       component, using EAP as a lower layer protocol, to obtain session
       policies. EAP Re-authentication Protocol is suggested as a mechanism
       to allow asynchronous use of SIP at upper layers.

  "A TCP Authentication Option Extension for NAT Traversal", Joseph Touch,
  23-May-13, <draft-touch-tcp-ao-nat-05.txt>

    This document describes an extension to the TCP Authentication
       Option (TCP-AO) to support its use over connections that pass
       through network address and/or port translators (NATs/NAPTs). This
       extension changes the data used to compute traffic keys, but does
       not alter TCP-AO's packet processing or key generation algorithms.

  "dIVI: Dual-Stateless IPv4/IPv6 Translation", Congxiao Bao, Xing Li, Yu
  Zhai, Wentao Shang, 18-Jun-13, <draft-xli-behave-divi-05.txt>

    This document presents the concepts and the implementations of
       address-sharing dual-stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation (dIVI).
    
       The dIVI is an extension of 1:1 stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation with
       features of IPv4 address sharing and dual translation.  The major
       benefits of those extensions are using public IPv4 addresses more
       effectively and removing the requirements of DNS64 and ALG, without
       loosing the stateless, end-to-end address transparency and
       bidirectional-initiated communications.

  "AS2 Restart for Very Large Messages", Terry Harding, 12-Jun-13,
  <draft-harding-as2-restart-05.txt>

  "Mesh Structured Hierarchical Networking and IPv6", Shyam Bandyopadhyay,
  19-May-13, <draft-shyam-mshn-ipv6-15.txt>

    This document tries to address an approach for reorganization of
       entire network in a large address space. It describes how a three-
       tier mesh structured hierarchy can be established based on
       fragmenting the entire space into some regions and sub regions inside
       each of them. It addresses issues which could be relevant to this
       architecture in the context of IPv6. This document also tries to come
       out with an approach how IP switch based network can perform as good
       as ATM network for the processing of real time traffic.

  "JSON Schema: core definitions and terminology", Francis Galiegue, Kris
  Zyp, Gary Court, 31-Jan-13, <draft-zyp-json-schema-04.txt>

    JSON Schema defines the media type "application/schema+json", a JSON
       based format for defining the structure of JSON data.  JSON Schema
       provides a contract for what JSON data is required for a given
       application and how to interact with it.  JSON Schema is intended to
       define validation, documentation, hyperlink navigation, and
       interaction control of JSON data.

  "Delay-Tolerant Networking LTP Convergence Layer (LTPCL) Adapter", Scott
  Burleigh, 25-Apr-13, <draft-burleigh-dtnrg-ltpcl-05.txt>

    This document describes the procedures by which the Licklider
       Transmission Protocol (LTP) is used as a "convergence-layer" protocol
       to convey Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) "bundles" between DTN
       nodes.

  Kaduk, 22-Jun-13, <draft-wilkinson-afs3-rxgk-06.txt>

    rxgk is a security class for the RX RPC protocol.  It uses the GSSAPI
       framework to provide an authentication service that provides
       authentication, confidentiality and integrity protection for the rxgk
       security class.  This document provides a general description of rxgk
       and how to integrate it into generic RX applications.  Application
       specific behaviour will be described, as necessary, in future
       documents.

  "Integrating rxgk with AFS", Simon Wilkinson, 18-Mar-13,
  <draft-wilkinson-afs3-rxgk-afs-02.txt>

    This document describes how the new GSSAPI-based rxgk security class
       for RX is integrated with the AFS application protocol.  It describes
       a number of extensions to the basic rxgk protocol, clarifies a number
       of implementation issues, and provides values for the application-
       specific elements of rxgk.

  "Stateless Automatic IPv4 over IPv6 Encapsulation / Decapsulation
  Technology: Global SA46T Address Format", Naoki Matsuhira, 6-Jan-13,
  <draft-matsuhira-sa46t-gaddr-06.txt>

    This document proposes Stateless Automatic IPv4 over IPv6
       Encapsulation / Decapsulation Technology (SA46T) Global Address
       Format.
    
       SA46T can apply to organization's network individually, but if
       coordination between the organizations made, the total number of
       times of encapsulations and decapusulations can be reduced.  That
       coordination is achieved by using same SA46T address format, that is
       Global address.  This document proposes SA46T Global address format.
    
       SA46T is a gateway technology, not protocol.  But SA46T Global
       Address needs IANA assignment, so this document should be categorized
       standard track or experimental.

  "Stateless Automatic IPv4 over IPv6 Encapsulation / Decapsulation
  Technology: Specification", Naoki Matsuhira, 6-Jan-13,
  <draft-matsuhira-sa46t-spec-06.txt>

    This document specifies Stateless Automatic IPv4 over IPv6
       Encapsulation / Decapsulation Technology (SA46T) base specification.
       SA46T makes backbone network to IPv6 only.  And also, SA46T can stack
       many IPv4 networks, i.e. the networks using same IPv4 (private)
       addresses, without interdependence.

  "Server Message Block and NetBIOS", Palanivelan Appanasamy, 10-Jan-13,
  <draft-palanivelan-netbios-smb-04.txt>

    The Server Message Block (SMB) is a presentation layer protocol
       providing file and print sharing functions for LAN Manager, and other
       network operating systems.
    
       The Network Basic I/O System (NetBIOS) NetBIOS was developed in the
       early 1980s to allow applications to communicate over a network. The
       TCP/IP version called NetBIOSoverTCP/IP(NetBT), was developed to
       support communications between symbolically named stations and
       transfer of arbitrary data.NetBT supports all three services (Name,
       Datagram and Session) supported by NetBIOS.
    
       This document attempts to provide, Control and Operational details on
       SMB over NetBT session, which is otherwise not clearly explained in
       the RFCs [Netbios concepts] and [Netbios specification] or any
       available documentation.
    
       This document is intended for documentation purpose and for
       informational use only.This document does not attempt to define a
       standard, rather tries explaining an existing implementation.
    
       This document puts together pieces of information scattered in
       multiple documents and offers a single complete documentation for
       this specific application (smb over NetBT).

  "Group Key Management using IKEv2", Sheela Rowles, Aldous Yeung, Paulina
  Tran, Yoav Nir, 28-Apr-13, <draft-yeung-g-ikev2-06.txt>

    This document presents a new group key distribution protocol.  The
       protocol is in conformance with MSEC key management architecture it
       contains two components: member registration and group rekeying, both
       downloading group security associations from the Group Controller Key
       Server to a member of the group.  The new protocol is similar to
       IKEv2 in message and payload formats as well as message semantics.

  "Xon/Xoff State Control for Telnet Com Port Control Option", Grant
  Edwards, 23-Mar-10,
  <draft-edwards-telnet-xon-xoff-state-control-00.txt,.pdf>

    This document defines new values for use with the telnet com port
    control option's SET-CONTROL sub-command defined in RFC2217.  These
    new values provide a mechanism for the telnet client to control and
    query the outbound Xon/Xoff flow control state of the telnet server's
    physical serial port.  This capability is exposed in the serial port
    API on some operating systems and is needed by telnet clients that
    implement a port-redirector service which provides applications local
    to the redirector/telnet-client with transparent access to the remote
    serial port on the telnet server.

  "Linear Protection Switching in MPLS-TP", Huub van Helvoort, Jeong-dong
  Ryoo, Zhang Haiyan, Feng Huang, Han Li, Alessandro D'Alessandro,
  6-May-13, <draft-zulr-mpls-tp-linear-protection-switching-07.txt,.pdf>

    This document specifies a linear protection switching mechanism for
       MPLS-TP.  This mechanism supports 1+1 unidirectional/bidirectional
       protection switching and 1:1 bidirectional protection switching.  It
       is purely supported by MPLS-TP data plane, and can work without any
       control plane.
    
       This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
       (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
       Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
       Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
       capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
       defined by the ITU-T.

  "Overlay Transport Virtualization", Hasmit Grover, Dhananjaya Rao, Dino
  Farinacci, Victor Moreno, 23-Feb-13, <draft-hasmit-otv-04.txt>

    In today's networking environment most enterprise networks span
       multiple physical sites.  Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV)
       provides a scalable solution for L2/L3 connectivity across different
       sites using the currently deployed service provider and enterprise
       networks.  It is a very cost-effective and simple solution requiring
       deployment of a one or more OTV functional device at each of the
       enterprise sites.  This solution is agnostic to the technology used
       in the service provider network and connectivity between the
       enterprise and the service provider network.  This document provides
       an overview of this technology.

  "Advanced Groupware Access Protocol", Iulian Radu, 8-May-13,
  <draft-iulian-advanced-groupware-access-protocol-07.txt>

    The Advanced Groupware Access Protocol, (AGAP) allows a client to
       access and store electronic mail messages, contacts, events, files,
       and configurations on a server.  The electronic mail messages can be
       grouped in folders.  AGAP also provides the capability for an offline
       client to resynchronize with the server.
    
       AGAP does not specify a means of posting electronic mail messages;
       this function is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as SMTP
       [RFC2821] .  It also does not specify a means for exchanging messages
       with contacts that are reported as being online; this function is
       handled by an instant messaging protocol such as XMPP [RFC3921] .
    
       AGAP includes the following operations for electronic mail messages:
       creating, deleting, renaming, moving and coping mail folders;
       checking for new messages; permanently removing messages; moving and
       coping messages between folders; fetching information about a
       message; setting and clearing tags for messages; searching in
       messages; retrieving only a part of a message; marking messages as
       SPAM; deleting attachments from a message.
    
       AGAP includes the following operations to manipulate the contacts:
       creating, deleting, moving, coping, tagging, and searching contacts;
       checking if a contact is online; fetching information about a
       contact.
    
       AGAP includes the following operations related to the use of the
       events: creating, deleting, moving, coping and tagging events in
       calendar; fetching events details; searching for events.
    
       All entries are read and written in format XML encoded UTF-8
       [RFC3629] and each entry is identified by a unique alphanumeric
       identifier.
    
       AGAP is designed to support access only to a single server per
       connection.  It is also designed to balance the volume of text
       exchanged between the server and clients and its readability by
       humans for debugging.

  "Benchmarking Power usage of networking devices", Vishwas Manral, Puneet
  Sharma, Sujata Banerjee, Yang Ping, 12-Mar-13,
  <draft-manral-bmwg-power-usage-04.txt>

    With the rapid growth of networks around the globe there is an ever
       increasing need to improve the energy efficiency of network devices.
       Operators are begining to seek more information of power consumption
       in the network, have no standard mechanism to measure, report and
       compare power usage of different networking equipment under different
       network configuration and conditions.
    
       This document provides suggestions for measuring power usage of live
       networks under different traffic loads and various switch router
       configuration settings.  It provides a benchmarking suite which can
       be employed for any networking device .

  "Implications of Full-Duplex HTTP", Wenbo Zhu, Mike Jennings, 15-May-13,
  <draft-zhu-http-fullduplex-07.txt>

    Full-duplex HTTP follows the basic HTTP request-response semantics
       but also allows the server to send response body to the client at the
       same time when the client is transmitting request body to the server.
       Requirements for full-duplex HTTP are under-specified in the existing
       HTTP specification [RFC2616], and this memo intends to clarify the
       requirements of full-duplex HTTP on top of the basic HTTP protocol
       semantics.

  "Protocol for Stage Illumination", Marcus Ertl, 24-May-13,
  <draft-mertl-psi-03.txt>

    This memo describes a protocol that builds upon UDP/IP to transport
       illumination and control data for stage, architectural and other
       illumination requirements.
    
       It may be understood as a spiritual successor of the traditional DMX
       (Digital MultipleX) specification series, removing it's limitations
       and adding flexibility and usability enhancements like auto-discovery
       and metadata, among other useful features.

  "A Mechanism for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Avalanche Restart
  Overload Control", Charles Shen, Henning Schulzrinne, Arata Koike,
  31-Dec-12, <draft-shen-soc-avalanche-restart-overload-05.txt>

    When a large number of clients register with a SIP registrar server
       at approximately the same time, the server may become overloaded.
       Near-simultaneous floods of SIP SUBSCRIBE and PUBLISH requests may
       have similar effects.  Such request avalanches can occur, for
       example, after a power failure and recovery in a metropolitan area.
       This document describes how to avoid such overload situations.  Under
       this mechanism, a server estimates an avalanche restart backoff
       interval during its normal operation and conveys this interval to its
       clients through a new Restart-Timer header in normal response
       messages.  Once an avalanche restart actually occurs, the clients
       perform backoff based on the previously received Restart-Timer header
       value before sending out the first request attempt.  Thus, the
       mechanism spreads all the initial client requests and prevents them
       from overloading the server.

  "Additional Methods for Generating Subject Key Identifiers and Subject

    This short I-D makes a number of partially interrelated proposals how
       to solve certain problems in the CoRE WG's main protocol, the
       Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).  The current version has
       been resubmitted to keep information about these proposals available;
       the proposals are not all fleshed out at this point in time.

  "Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Scheme for Digital Video Broadcasting
  (DVB) Programme Resources", Mo McRoberts, Alexander Adolf, 26-Mar-13,
  <draft-mcroberts-uri-dvb-10.txt>

    Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes for broadcasting programme
    resources transmitted over MPEG-2 Transport Streams [MPEG-Systems]
    have been devised in their process of creating standards by the
    Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB), the Association of Radio
    Industries and Businesses in Japan (ARIB) and the OpenCable
    Application Platform (OCAP) to acquire current and future scheduled
    publications of broadcast media content from multimedia applications
    such as HTTP, MHP [DVB-MHP], OCAP [OCAP1.0] or other XML based
    metadata.
    
    These URI are used to locate the actual digital TV, Radio or other
    multimedia broadcast programme services (i.e., channels or events)
    and also the audio-visual components related to that programme, for
    example an HTTP-based programme guide on the Web or other XML-based
    electronic programme guides in digital broadcast receivers.
    
    This document defines the "dvb" URI scheme for the benefit of the
    Internet community, given its definition as part of the Digital Video
    Broadcasting (DVB) suite of ETSI standards.

  "Load Sharing for the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)", Paul
  Amer, Martin Becke, Thomas Dreibholz, Nasif Ekiz, Janardhan Iyengar,
  Preethi Natarajan, Randall Stewart, Michael Tuexen, 26-Mar-13,
  <draft-tuexen-tsvwg-sctp-multipath-06.txt>

    The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) supports multi-homing
       for providing network fault tolerance.  However, mainly one path is
       used for data transmission.  Only timer-based retransmissions are
       carried over other paths as well.
    
       This document describes how multiple paths can be used simultaneously
       for transmitting user messages.

  "ISIS Protocol Extensions for Boundary Node Discovery (BND)", Dhruv
  Dhody, Udayasree Palle, 21-Feb-13,
  <draft-dhody-pce-bn-discovery-isis-06.txt>

    The Path Computation Element (PCE) may be used for computing multi-

       Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switch Path
       (LSP).
    
       In this circumstance, it is highly desirable to be able to
       dynamically and automatically discover a set of Boundary Nodes (BN)
       along with their domain information.  For that purpose, this document
       defines extensions to the Intermediate System to Intermediate
       System(IS-IS) routing protocol for the advertisement of Boundary Node
       (BN)Discovery information within an IS-IS area or within the entire
       IS-IS routing domain.

  "Registry Data Escrow Specification", Francisco Arias, Gustavo Lozano,
  Shoji Noguchi, 4-Apr-13,
  <draft-arias-noguchi-registry-data-escrow-06.txt>

    This document specifies the format and contents of data escrow
       deposits targeted primarily for domain name registries.  However, the
       specification was designed to be independent of the underlying
       objects that are being escrowed, therefore it could be used for
       purposes other than domain name registries.

    (at sign) in URIs and partial URI-like addresses.

  "Port Management To Reduce Logging In Large-Scale NATs", Tina Tsou,
  Weibo Li, Tom Taylor, 9-May-13,
  <draft-tsou-behave-natx4-log-reduction-03.txt>

    Various IPv6 transition strategies require the introduction of large-
       scale NATs (e.g.  AFTR, NAT64) to share the limited supply of IPv4
       addresses available in the network until transition is complete.
       There has recently been debate over how to manage the sharing of
       ports between different subscribers sharing the same IPv4 address.
       One factor in the discussion is the operational requirement to log
       the assignment of transport addresses to subscribers.  It has been
       argued that dynamic assignment of individual ports between
       subscribers requires the generation of an excessive volume of logs.
       This document suggests a way to achieve dynamic port sharing while
       keeping log volumes low.

  "Media Resource Broker (MRB) Location Function (MLF)", Chris Boulton,
  John Dally, 28-Jan-13,
  <draft-boulton-mediactrl-mrb-location-function-04.txt>

    The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF has produced a complete
       architecture for controlling media server resources in Internet
       Protocol (IP) based networks.  An important function in the MediaCtrl
       architecture is the Media Resource Broker entity which monitors and
       allocates media resources to requesting applications.  This document
       introduces a Media Resource Broker (MRB) Location Function (MLF)
       which works in partnership with MRB's in large deployments providing
       a light weight scaling and failover mechanism.

  "Hosts with Any Network Connectivity Using "Bump-in-the-API"(BIA)", Ala
  Hamarsheh, 19-Jan-11, <draft-hamarsheh-behave-biav2-05.txt>

    This document specifies a mechanism for hosts with any network
     connectivity (IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or dual IPv4/IPv6 
    connectivity) to run applications of any capability 
    (IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or dual IPv4/IPv6) without any 
    modification to those applications. It is a generalisation 
    of a previous experimental protocol called "Bump-in-the-API"
    (BIA) [RFC3338]. New mechanism of BIA allows a changeover between
    the application layer and the IP communication layers from IPv4 
    to IPv6 and vice versa or IPv6 to IPv4 and vice versa, without 
    requiring those applications to be converted in addressing 
    capabilities, effectively shielding the application layer from
    IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity. This is considered by the authors to
    be one of the essential conditions for the transition to IPv6
    in the Internet to be successful.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Authentication Using GSM 2G
  Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA)", Lionel Morand, 21-Jan-13,
  <draft-morand-http-digest-2g-aka-03.txt>

    This memo specifies a one-time password generation mechanism for
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest access authentication based
    on Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) authentication and
    key generation functions A3 and A8, also known as GSM AKA or 2G AKA.
    The HTTP Authentication Framework includes two authentication
    schemes: Basic and Digest.  Both schemes employ a shared secret based
    mechanism for access authentication.  The GSM AKA mechanism performs
    user authentication and session key distribution in GSM and Universal
    Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks.  GSM AKA is a
    challenge-response based mechanism that uses symmetric cryptography.

       transport binding and the corresponding 'ipps' URI scheme, that is
       used to designate the access to the network location of a secure IPP
       print service or a network resource (for example, a print job)
       managed by such a service.
    
       This memo is published by the IETF on behalf of the Internet Printing
       Protocol Working Group of the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working Group.
    
       This memo updates RFC 2910 and RFC 2911.

  "Using the International Mobile station Equipment Identity(IMEI)URN as
  an Instance ID", Andrew Allen, 6-May-13,
  <draft-allen-dispatch-imei-urn-as-instanceid-09.txt>

    This specification defines how the Uniform Resource Name namespace
       reserved for the GSMA (GSM Association) identities and its sub-
       namespace for the IMEI (International Mobile station Equipment
       Identity) can be used as an instance-id as specified in RFC 5626 [1]
       and also as used by RFC 5627 [2].  Its purpose is to fulfil the
       requirements in RFC 5626 [1] that state "If a URN scheme other than
       UUID is used, the UA MUST only use URNs for which an RFC (from the
       IETF stream) defines how the specific URN needs to be constructed and
       used in the "+sip.instance" Contact header field parameter for
       outbound behavior."

  "Secure Extension of BGP by Decoupling Path Propagation and Adoption",
  Mingui Zhang, Bin Liu, Dacheng Zhang, Beichuan Zhang, Beichuan Zhang,
  24-Dec-12, <draft-zhang-idr-decoupling-06.txt>

    This draft proposes a novel mitigation scheme to protect the inter-
       domain data delivery during false routing announcements. A new path
       attribute is defined to Decouple propagation of a path and adoption
       of a path for data forwarding in BGP (DBGP). DBGP does not use
       suspicious paths for data forwarding, but still propagates them in
       the routing system to facilitate attack detection. It can extensively
       protect data delivery from routing announcements of false sub-
       prefixes, false origins, false nodes and false links, and works well
       with ongoing attack detection and prevention systems.

  "Assessing the Impact of Carrier-Grade NAT on Network Applications",
  Chris Donley, Lee Howard, Victor Kuarsingh, John Berg, University
  Colorado, 5-Apr-13, <draft-donley-nat444-impacts-06.txt>

    NAT444 is an IPv4 extension technology being considered by Service
       Providers to continue offering IPv4 service to customers while
       transitioning to IPv6.  This technology adds an extra Carrier-Grade
       NAT ("CGN") in the Service Provider network, often resulting in two
       NATs.  CableLabs, Time Warner Cable, and Rogers Communications
       independently tested the impacts of NAT444 on many popular Internet
       services using a variety of test scenarios, network topologies, and
       vendor equipment.  This document identifies areas where adding a
       second layer of NAT disrupts the communication channel for common
       Internet applications.  This document was updated to also include
       Dual-Stack Lite impacts.

  "HTTP framework for time-based access to resource states -- Memento",
  Herbert Van de Sompel, Michael Nelson, Robert Sanderson, 29-Mar-13,
  <draft-vandesompel-memento-07.txt>

    The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web.
       It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given
       resource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps.  Datetime
       negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the
       given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime.  TimeMaps
       are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior
       states of the given resource.  The framework also facilitates
       recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of
       another resource.

  "Applicability of Proxy Mobile IPv6 Protocol for WLAN Access Networks",
  Sri Gundavelli, 23-Apr-13,
  <draft-gundavelli-netext-pmipv6-wlan-applicability-05.txt>

    Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility management protocol.
       The protocol is designed for providing mobility management support to
       a mobile node, without requiring its participation in any IP mobility
       related signaling.  The base protocol is defined in an access
       technology independent manner, it identifies the general requirements
       from the link-layer for supporting the protocol operation.  However,
       it does not provide any specific details on how it can be supported
       on a specific access technology.  This specification identifies the
       key considerations for supporting Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol on the
       widely deployed wireless LAN access architectures, based on IEEE
       802.11 standards.  It explores the current dominant wireless LAN
       deployment models and provides the needed interworking details.

  "Mobile Ad-hoc On-Demand Data Delivery Protocol (MAODDP)", Humayun
  Bakht, 28-Jul-11, <draft-bakht-maoddp-01.txt>

    Routing in mobile ad-hoc network is achieved through the mutual
    cooperation of mobile devices that form routes in between two mobile
    nodes.It is one of the challenging issues in mobile ad-hoc network [1].
    The current protocols for an ad-hoc network can generally be categorized
    into two groups i.e. pro-active and re-active[15,16,17,18].
    Pro-active protocols by continuously evaluating the known and attempting
    to discover new routes.
    These protocols try to maintain the most up-to-date view of the
    network[2]. This allows them to efficiently forward packets as the route
    is known in advanced [14]. In contrast reactive protocols determine the
    route only when require [3, 5, 6].
    Mobile Ad-hoc On Demand Data Delivery protocol (MAODDP) establishes
    route on demand and delivers the data at the same time one after the
    other [22].MAODDP support both unicast and multicast routing.
    It is designed to minimize reaction to topological changes.
    In order to ensure the freshness of route MAODDP uses combination
    of sequence numbers and broadcast ID. MAODDP is loop-free,
    self-starting protocol whic can scales to different size of networks.
    MAODDP offers quick adaptation to the dynamic link
    conditions and determines routes to the destinations on demand.

  "Commentary on the Design of the Authenticated-Enveloped-Data Content
  Type", Jim Schaad, 6-Apr-11, <draft-schaad-smime-aed-rant-02.txt>

    The Authenticated-Enveloped-Data Content Type allows for the use of
    Authenticated-Enveloped modes with block cipher algorithms.  At the
    time of the original design there was discussion about the relative
    location of the authenticated attributes and the encrypted content in
    the ASN.1 structure.  With the benefits of implementation experience
    I revisit the discussion made at the time and re-evaluate the
    decision made.

  So Ning, Paul Unbehagen, Monique Morrow, Masum Hasan, Yuri Demchenko,
  Meng Yu, 26-Dec-12, <draft-khasnabish-cloud-reference-framework-04.txt>

    This document presents a cloud reference framework that intends to
    provide a basis for designing interoperable cloud services and their
    integration into existing open Internet and enterprise IT
    infrastructures.
    
    In general, a cloud-based system utilizes virtualized computing /
    communications / storage resources and applications, and allows their
    combined provisioning as complex infrastructure services.  In the
    emerging cloud-based virtualized infrastructures and services are
    provisioned on on-demand basis, and configured for specific customer
    needs or tasks.
    
    The reference framework is based on the survey of the SDOs and WGs
    that are focusing on cloud-based systems and services (Cloud SDO,
    I-D.Khasnabish-cloud-sdo-survey), on-going standardisation activities
    and other research and developments in the cloud computing technology
    area.  Both intra-cloud and inter-cloud reference frameworks are
    presented and the requirements to the general functional layers and
    components are discussed.

  "Encoding the graphemes of the SignWriting Script with the x-ISWA-2010",
  Stephen Slevinski, Valerie Sutton, 3-Jan-11,
  <draft-slevinski-iswa-2010-00.txt>

    For concreteness, because the universal character set is not yet
    universal, because an undocumented and unlabeled coded character set
    hampers information interchange, a 12-bit coded character set has
    been created that encodes the graphemes of the SignWriting script as
    described in the open standard of the International SignWriting
    Alphabet 2010.  The x-ISWA-2010 coded character set is defined with
    hexadecimal characters and described with Unicode characters, either
    proposed characters on plane 1 or interchange characters on plane 15.
    
    This memo defines a standard coded character set for the Internet
    community.  It is published for reference, examination,
    implementation, and evaluation.  Distribution of this memo is
    unlimited.

    This memo specifies modifications required to NAT64 so that IPv6 only
       hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4 only servers.  The
       protocol is based on translating IPv4 multicast data before
       delivering it to the host in IPv6.  The protocol also allows IPv6
       only host to join IPv4 any source/ source specific multicast group in
       IPv6 using Multicast Listener Discovery protocol.

  "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO package for Private Wire",
  Richard Beauchamp, Finlay Fraser, Chris Boulton, 28-Jan-13,
  <draft-beauchamp-private-wire-06.txt>

    Application level data exchanged using the SIP INFO method are
       supported and documented in specifications known as 'INFO Packages'.
       This document defines functionality associated with Session
       Initiation Protocol (SIP) Private Wire functionality and creates an
       'INFO Package' for carrying such application level data.

  "A Simple Method for Segmenting Multicast Tunnels for Multicast VPNs",
  Maria Napierala, Eric Rosen, 10-Apr-13,
  <draft-rosen-l3vpn-mvpn-segments-05.txt>

    To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) Service, Service Providers (SPs) need
       to instantiate multicast tunnels (known as "P-tunnels") that enable
       the Provider Edge (PE) routers of a given VPN to transmit multicast
       packets to each other.  Some SPs organize their networks in a
       hierarchical manner, with the PE routers in "edge areas", and the
       edge areas connected to each other via a "core area". A P-tunnel that
       connects PE routers in different edge areas can be thought of as
       having three segments: a segment through one edge area, a segment
       through the core area, and a segment through the second edge area.
       It is desirable to preserve the independence of the core area by
       allowing it to use a different tunneling technology than that used in
       the edge areas.  However, it is not desirable for the core area
       Border Routers (BRs) to participate in the MVPN-specific signaling,
       or even to have any knowledge of which MVPNs are in the edge areas
       that attach to it.  This document specifies a simple method for
       segmenting MVPN P-tunnels at the BRs, subject to these constraints.

  "A Uniform Resource Name Namespace for the Device Identity and the
  Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID)", Roozbeh Atarius, 21-Feb-13,
  <draft-atarius-dispatch-meid-urn-03.txt>

    The specification fulfills the requirement from Third Generation
       Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) by registering a Uniform Resource Name
       (URN) namespace for the device identity and a sub namespace for the
       Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID).  The structure of the MEID is 15
       hexadecimal encoded digits long and is defined in 3GPP2 to uniquely
       identify a mobile equipment.

  "Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar", Mike Douglass, 5-Jun-13,
  <draft-douglass-calendar-extension-03.txt,.pdf>

    This specification introduces a number of new iCalendar properties
       which are of particular use for event publishers and in social
       networking.

  "PCEP Extension for WSON Routing and Wavelength Assignment", Young Lee,
  Ramon Casellas, 6-Feb-13, <draft-lee-pce-wson-rwa-ext-05.txt>

    This draft provides the Path Computation Element communication
       Protocol (PCEP) extensions for the support of Routing and Wavelength
       Assignment (RWA) in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON).
       Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a routing and wavelength
       assignment (RWA) process.  From a path computation perspective,
       wavelength assignment is the process of determining which wavelength
       can be used on each hop of a path and forms an additional routing
       constraint to optical light path computation.

  "Recommendations for Efficient Implementation of RPL", Omprakash
  Gnawali, P Levis, 14-Mar-13,
  <draft-gnawali-roll-rpl-recommendations-05.txt>

    RPL is a flexible routing protocol applicable to a wide range of Low
       Power and Lossy Networks.  To enable this wide applicability, RPL
       provides many configuration options and gives implementers choices on
       how to implement various components of RPL.  Drawing on our
       experiences, we distill the design choices and configuration
       parameters that lead to efficient RPL implementations and operations.

  "MPLS-TP Ring Protection Switching (MRPS)", Huub van Helvoort,
  Jeong-dong Ryoo, 13-Apr-13,
  <draft-helvoort-mpls-tp-ring-protection-switching-04.txt>

    This document describes a mechanism to address the requirements for
       protection of the Multi-Protocol Label Switching Transport Profile
       (MPLS-TP) Label Switched Paths (LSP) in a ring topology.  The
       mechanism defined herein is designed to support point-to-point as
       well as point-to-multipoint LSPs.
    
       The MPLS-TP section layer OAM is used to monitor the connectivity
       between each two adjacent nodes using the mechanisms defined in the
       [RFC6371].
    
       The Automatic Protection Switching (APS) protocol is used for
       coordination of protection switching actions between the ring nodes.

  "Multipath RTP (MPRTP)", Varun Singh, Teemu Karkkainen, Joerg Ott, Saba
  Ahsan, Lars Eggert, 11-Jan-13, <draft-singh-avtcore-mprtp-06.txt>

    The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to deliver real-time
       content and, along with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), forms the
       control channel between the sender and receiver.  However, RTP and
       RTCP assume a single delivery path between the sender and receiver
       and make decisions based on the measured characteristics of this
       single path.  Increasingly, endpoints are becoming multi-homed, which
       means that they are connected via multiple Internet paths.  Network
       utilization can be improved when endpoints use multiple parallel
       paths for communication.  The resulting increase in reliability and
       throughput can also enhance the user experience.  This document
       extends the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) so that a single
       session can take advantage of the availability of multiple paths
       between two endpoints.

  "Diverse Path Implementation Report", Jeff Tantsura, Selma Yilmaz, Keyur
  Patel, Satish Mynam, Robert Raszuk, 7-May-13,
  <draft-mynam-grow-diverse-path-impl-01.txt>

    This document provides an implementation report for Diverse Path as
       defined in RFC6774.  The editor did not verify the accuracy of the
       information provided by respondents or by any alternative means.  The
       respondents are experts with the implementations they reported on,
       and their responses are considered authoritative for the
       implementations for which their responses represent.

  "Guidelines for Adding Congestion Notification to Protocols that
  Encapsulate IP", Bob Briscoe, John Kaippallimalil, Patricia Thaler,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-briscoe-tsvwg-ecn-encap-guidelines-02.txt>

    The purpose of this document is to guide the design of congestion
       notification in any lower layer or tunnelling protocol that
       encapsulates IP.  The aim is for explicit congestion signals to
       propagate consistently from lower layer protocols into IP.  Then the
       IP internetwork layer can act as a portability layer to carry
       congestion notification from non-IP-aware congested nodes up to the
       transport layer (L4).  Following these guidelines should assure
       interworking between new lower layer congestion notification
       mechanisms, whether specified by the IETF or other standards bodies.

  "6LoWPAN Roadmap and Implementation Guide", Carsten Bormann, 13-Apr-13,
  <draft-bormann-6lowpan-roadmap-04.txt>

    6LoWPAN is defined in RFC 4944 in conjunction with a number of
       specifications that are currently nearing completion.  The entirety
       of these specifications may be hard to understand, pose specific
       implementation problems, or be simply inconsistent.
    
       The present guide aims to provide a roadmap to these documents as
       well as provide specific advice how to use these specifications in
       combination.  In certain cases, it may provide clarifications or even
       corrections to the specifications referenced.
    
       This guide is intended as a continued work-in-progress, i.e.  a long-
       lived Internet-Draft, to be updated whenever new information becomes
       available and new consensus on how to handle issues is formed.
       Similar to the ROHC implementation guide, RFC 4815, it might be
       published as an RFC at some future time later in the maintenance
       curve of the specifications.
    
       This document does not describe a new protocol or attempt to set a
       new standard of any kind - it mostly describes good practice in using
       the existing specifications, but it may also document emerging
       consensus where a correction needs to be made.

  "A Forward-Search P2P TE LSP Inter-Domain Path Computation", Huaimo
  Chen, Dhruv Dhody, 29-Apr-13,
  <draft-chen-pce-forward-search-p2p-path-computation-06.txt>

    This document presents a forward search procedure for computing paths
       for Point-to-Point (P2P) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched
       Paths (LSPs) crossing a number of domains using multiple Path
       Computation Elements (PCEs).  In addition, extensions to the Path
       Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) for supporting the
       forward search procedure are described.

  "The FNV Non-Cryptographic Hash Algorithm", Glenn Fowler, Landon Noll,
  Kiem-Phong Vo, Donald Eastlake, 6-Apr-13, <draft-eastlake-fnv-05.txt>

    FNV (Fowler/Noll/Vo) is a fast, non-cryptographic hash algorithm with
       good dispersion. The purpose of this document is to make information
       on FNV and open source code performing FNV conveniently available to
       the Internet community.

  "Security Considerations in the IP-based Internet of Things", Oscar
  Garcia-Morchon, Sye Keoh, Sandeep Kumar, Rene Hummen, Rene Struik,
  11-Mar-13, <draft-garcia-core-security-05.txt>

    A direct interpretation of the Internet of Things concept refers to
       the usage of standard Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing
       or thing-to-thing communication.  Although the security needs are
       well-recognized, it is still not fully clear how existing IP-based
       security protocols can be applied to this new setting.  This
       Internet-Draft first provides an overview of security architecture,
       its deployment model and general security needs in the context of the
       lifecycle of a thing.  Then, it presents challenges and requirements
       for the successful roll-out of new applications and usage of standard
       IP-based security protocols when applied to get a functional Internet
       of Things.

  "DECADE Protocol", Richard Alimi, Akbar Rahman, Dirk Kutscher, Yang
  Yang, Haibin Song, Kostas Pentikousis, 7-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-decade-arch-10.txt>

    Content Distribution Applications (e.g., P2P applications) are widely
       used on the Internet and make up a large portion of the traffic in
       many networks.  One technique to improve the network efficiency of
       these applications is to introduce storage capabilities within the
       networks; this is the capability provided by a DECADE (DECoupled
       Application Data Enroute) compatible system.  This document presents
       an architecture, discusses the underlying principles, and identifies
       key functionalities in the architecture for introducing a DECADE in-
       network storage system.  In addition, some examples are given to
       illustrate these concepts.

  "Data Center Mobility based on E-VPN, BGP/MPLS IP VPN, IP Routing and
  NHRP", Rahul Aggarwal, Yakov Rekhter, Wim Henderickx, Ravi Shekhar,
  Luyuan Fang, Ali Sajassi, 10-Jun-13,
  <draft-raggarwa-data-center-mobility-05.txt>

    This document describes a set of network-based solutions for seamless
       Virtual Machine mobility in the data center. These solutions provide
       a toolkit which is based on IP routing, E-VPNs, BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, and
       NHRP.

  "A packet based method for passive performance monitoring", Alessandro
  Capello, Mauro Cociglio, Luca Castaldelli, Alberto Bonda, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-tempia-opsawg-p3m-03.txt>

    This document describes a passive method to perform packet loss,
       delay and jitter measurements on live traffic.  Implementation and
       deployment details are also explained in order to clarify how the
       tools and features currently available on existing routing platforms
       can be used to implement the method.  This method has been invented
       and engineered in Telecom Italia and it's currently being used in
       Telecom Italia's network.

  "Port Control Protocol (PCP) Extension for Port Set Allocation", Qiong
  Sun, Mohamed Boucadair, Senthil Sivakumar, Cathy Zhou, Tina Tsou, Simon
  Perreault, 25-Feb-13, <draft-tsou-pcp-natcoord-10.txt>

    This document defines an extension to PCP allowing clients to
       manipulate sets of ports as a whole.  This is accomplished by a new
       MAP option: PORT_SET.

  "Multipath TCP Support for Single-homed End-systems", Rolf Winter,
  Andreas Ripke, 25-Feb-13, <draft-wr-mptcp-single-homed-04.txt>

    Multipath TCP relies on the existence of multiple paths at the end-
       systems typically provided through different IP addresses obtained by
       different ISPs.  While this scenario is certainly becoming
       increasingly a reality (e.g.  mobile devices), currently most end-
       systems are single-homed (e.g.  desktop PCs in an enterprise).  This
       memo describes mechanisms to make multiple paths available to
       multipath TCP-capable end-systems that are not available directly at
       the end-systems but somewhere within the network.

  "Applicability of Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
  User-Network Interface (UNI)", Fatai Zhang, Oscar de Dios, Adrian
  Farrel, Xian Zhang, Daniele Ceccarelli, 21-Feb-13,
  <draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-uni-app-03.txt>

    Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) defines a set of
       protocols for the creation of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in various
       switching technologies. The GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) was
       developed in RFC4208 in order to be applied to an overlay network
       architectural model.
    
       This document examines a number of GMPLS UNI application scenarios.
       It shows how techniques developed after the GMPLS UNI can be applied
       to automate or enable critical processes for these applications. This
       document also suggests simple extensions that could be made to
       existing technologies to further enable the UNI and points out some
       unresolved issues.

  "Adaptive VLAN Assignment for Data Center RBridges", Mingui Zhang,
  Dacheng Zhang, 23-Apr-13, <draft-zhang-trill-vlan-assign-05.txt>

    If RBridges are casually assigned as Appointed Forwarders for VLANs
       without considering the number of MAC addresses and traffic load of
       these VLANs, it may overload some of the RBridges while leave other
       RBridges lightly loaded, which reduces the scalability of a RBridge
       network and undermines its performance.
    
       A new mechanism is designed in this document to support the adaptive
       VLAN assignment (or Appointed Forwarder selection) based on the
       forwarders' reporting of their usage of MAC tables and available
       bandwidth.

  "Depth-First Forwarding in Unreliable Networks (DFF)", Ulrich Herberg,
  Alvaro Cardenas, Tadashige Iwao, Michael Dow, Sandra Cespedes, 7-May-13,
  <draft-cardenas-dff-14.txt>

    This document specifies the "Depth-First Forwarding" (DFF) protocol
       for IPv6 networks, a data forwarding mechanism that can increase
       reliability of data delivery in networks with dynamic topology and/or
       lossy links.  The protocol operates entirely on the forwarding plane,
       but may interact with the routing plane.  DFF forwards data packets
       using a mechanism similar to a "depth-first search" for the
       destination of a packet.  The routing plane may be informed of
       failures to deliver a packet or loops.  This document specifies the
       DFF mechanism both for IPv6 networks (as specified in RFC2460) and in
       addition also for LoWPAN "mesh-under" networks (as specified in
       RFC4944).  The design of DFF assumes that the underlying link layer
       provides means to detect if a packet has been successfully delivered
       to the next hop or not.  It is applicable for networks with little
       traffic, and is used for unicast transmissions only.

  "A Forward-Search P2MP TE LSP Inter-Domain Path Computation", Huaimo
  Chen, Dhruv Dhody, 29-Apr-13,
  <draft-chen-pce-forward-search-p2mp-path-05.txt>

    This document presents a forward search procedure for computing a
       path for a Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label
       Switched Path (LSP) crossing a number of domains through using
       multiple Path Computation Elements (PCEs).  In addition, extensions
       to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) for
       supporting the forward search procedure are described.

  "On demand IPv4 address provisioning in Dual-Stack PPP deployment
  scenarios", Karsten Fleischhauer, Olaf Bonness, 12-Mar-13,
  <draft-fleischhauer-ipv4-addr-saving-04.txt>

    Today the Dual-Stack approach is the most straightforward and the
       most common way for introducing IPv6 into existing systems and
       networks.  However a typical drawback of implementing Dual-Stack is
       that each node will still require at least one IPv4 address.  Hence,
       solely deploying Dual-Stack does not provide a sufficient solution to
       the IPv4 address exhaustion problem.  Assuming a situation where most
       of the IP communication (e.g.  always-on, VoIP etc.)  can be provided
       via IPv6, the usage of public IPv4 addresses can significantly be
       reduced and the unused public IPv4 addresses can under certain
       circumstances be returned to the public IPv4 address pool of the
       service provider.  New Dual-Stack enabled services can be introduced
       without increasing the public IPv4 address demand, whereas IPv6 will
       be the preferred network layer protocol.  This document describes
       such a solution in a Dual-Stack PPP session network scenario and
       explains the protocol mechanisms which are used.

  "Route Flap Damping Deployment Status Survey", Shishio Tsuchiya, Seiichi
  Kawamura, Randy Bush, Cristel Pelsser, 21-Jun-12,
  <draft-shishio-grow-isp-rfd-implement-survey-05.txt>

    BGP Route Flap Damping [RFC2439] is a mechanism that targets route
    stability.  It penalyzes routes that flap with the aim of reducing
    CPU load on the routers.
    
    But it has side-effects.  Thus, in 2006, RIPE recommended not to use
    Route Flap Damping (see [RIPE-378]).
    
    Now, some researchers propose to turn RFD, with less aggressive
    parameters, back on [draft-ymbk-rfd-usable].
    
    This document describes results of a survey conducted among service
    provider on their use of BGP Route Flap Damping.

  "Transport of Fast Notification Messages", Wenhu Lu, Sriganesh Kini,
  Andras Csaszar, Gabor Envedi, Jeff Tantsura, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-lu-fn-transport-04.txt>

    This document specifies mechanisms for fast and light-weight
       dissemination of event notifications.  The purpose is to enable
       dataplane dissemination of Fast Notifications (FNs).  The draft
       discusses the design goals, the message container and options for
       delivering the notifications to all routers within a routing area.

  "Layer 2 (L2) LISP Encapsulation Format", Michael Smith, Dinesh Dutt,
  Dino Farinacci, Fabio Maino, 24-Jan-13, <draft-smith-lisp-layer2-02.txt>

    This memo describes an encapsulation method for carrying Ethernet and
       IEEE 802 media access control (MAC) frames within the Locator/ID
       Separation Protocol (LISP).

  "Deterministic Usage of DSA and ECDSA Digital Signature Algorithms",
  Thomas Pornin, 30-May-13, <draft-pornin-deterministic-dsa-02.txt>

    This document defines a deterministic digital signature generation
       procedure.  Such signatures are compatible with standard DSA and
       ECDSA digital signatures, and can be processed with unmodified
       verifiers, which need not be aware of the procedure described
       therein.  Deterministic signatures retain the cryptographic security
       features associated with digital signatures, but can be more easily
       implemented in various environments since they do not need access to
       a source of high quality randomness.

  "IP protocol suite extensions to support CONET Information Centric
  Networking", Andrea Detti, Stefano Salsano, Nicola Blefari-Melazzi,
  20-Jun-13, <draft-detti-conet-ip-option-05.txt>

    The Information Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm shifts the focus of
       networking from providing connections between hosts to efficiently
       providing content to the users.  The work on ICN has traditionally
       been performed looking at "clean-slate" solutions which aims to
       replace IP with a new paradigm.  On the other hand, in this memo we
       propose an "integration" approach to Information Centric Networking,
       i.e. we extend the IP protocol suite by defining a new IP Protocol
       type (CONET).  Then we propose two ways of carring ICN related
       information in IP packets, one uses a new IP Option (both for IPv4
       and IPv6), the other one only relies on the IP payload.  The ICN
       related information is used by network nodes and end nodes to support
       networking based on content rather than (or better in addition to)
       end-point addresses.

  "A Description of KCipher-2 Encryption Algorithm", Shinsaku Kiyomoto,
  Wook Shin, 17-Jun-13, <draft-kiyomoto-kcipher2-09.txt>

    This document describes the KCipher-2 encryption algorithm. KCipher-2
       is a stream cipher with a 128-bit key and a 128-bit initialization
       vector. Since the algorithm for KCipher-2 was published in 2007,
       security and efficiency have been rigorously evaluated through
       academic and industrial studies. No security vulnerability has been
       found as of the time this document was written. KCipher-2 offers fast
       encryption and decryption by means of simple operations that enable
       efficient implementation. KCipher-2 has been used for industrial
       applications, especially for mobile health monitoring and diagnostic
       services in Japan.

  "Verification Involving PSTN Reachability: Requirements and Architecture
  Overview", Mary Barnes, Cullen Jennings, Jonathan Rosenberg, Marc
  Petit-Huguenin, 25-Feb-13, <draft-jennings-vipr-overview-04.txt>

    The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has seen widespread deployment
       within individual domains, typically supporting voice and video
       communications.  Though it was designed from the outset to support
       inter-domain federation over the public Internet, such federation has
       not materialized.  The primary reasons for this are the complexities
       of inter-domain phone number routing and concerns over security.
       This document reviews this problem space, outlines requirements, and
       then describes a new model and technique for inter-domain federation
       with SIP involving the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN),
       called Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (VIPR).  VIPR
       addresses the problems that have prevented inter-domain federation
       over the Internet.  It provides fully distributed inter-domain
       routing for phone numbers, authorized mappings from phone numbers to
       domains, a new technique for automated SIP anti-spam, and privacy of
       number ownership, all while preserving the trapezoidal model of SIP.

  "A SAVI solution for WLAN", Jun Bi, Jianping Wu, You Wang, Tao Lin,
  5-Feb-13, <draft-bi-savi-wlan-03.txt>

    This document describes a source address validation solution for WLAN
       enabling 802.11i or other security mechanisms. This mechanism snoops
       NDP and DHCP to bind IP address with MAC address, and relies on the
       security of MAC address guaranteed by 802.11i or other mechanisms to
       filter IP spoofing packets. It can work in the special situations
       described in the charter of SAVI workgroup, such as multiple MAC
       addresses on one interface. This document describes three different
       deployment scenarios, with solutions for migration of binding entries
       when hosts move from one access point to another.

  "Suite B Profile for Datagram Transport Layer Security / Secure
  Real-time Transport Protocol (DTLS-SRTP)", Michael Peck, Kevin Igoe,
  21-Jun-13, <draft-peck-suiteb-dtls-srtp-03.txt>

    The United States government has published guidelines for "NSA Suite
       B Cryptography", which defines cryptographic algorithm policy for
       national security applications.  This document describes the use of
       Suite B cryptography with the Datagram Transport Layer Security
       (DTLS) protocol, the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP), and
       the Secure Real-Time Transport Control Protocol (SRTCP) to provide a
       robust architecture for securing real-time data.

  "Launch Phase Mapping for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)",
  James Gould, Wil Tan, Gavin Brown, 17-May-13,
  <draft-tan-epp-launchphase-11.txt>

    This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
       extension mapping for the provisioning and management of domain name
       registrations and applications during the launch of a domain name
       registry.

  "Extensions to Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
  for Hierarchical Path Computation Elements (PCE)", Fatai Zhang, Quintin
  Zhao, Oscar de Dios, Ramon Casellas, Daniel King, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-zhang-pce-hierarchy-extensions-03.txt>

    The Hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE) architecture,
       defined in the companion framework document [RFC6805], provides a
       mechanism to allow the optimum sequence of domains to be selected,
       and the optimum end-to-end path to be derived through the use of a
       hierarchical relationship between domains.
    
       This document defines the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)
       extensions for the purpose of implementing Hierarchical PCE
       procedures which are described in the aforementioned document.

  "Standardised ECC Cipher Suites for TLS", Peter Gutmann, 20-Mar-13,
  <draft-gutmann-tls-eccsuites-04.txt>

    This document describes a set of standard ECC cipher suites for TLS
       that simplify the complex selection procedure described in the
       existing ECC RFC, simplifying implementation and easing
       interoperability problems.

  "URI Fragment Identifiers for the text/csv Media Type", Michael
  Hausenblas, Erik Wilde, Jeni Tennison, 3-May-13,
  <draft-hausenblas-csv-fragment-03.txt>

    This memo defines URI fragment identifiers for text/csv MIME
    entities.  These fragment identifiers make it possible to refer to
    parts of a text/csv MIME entity, identified by row, column, or cell.
    Fragment identification can use single items, or ranges.
    
    Note to Readers

  "IPv6 Multicast in a 6rd Deployment", Behcet Sarikaya, Tina Tsou, Hui
  Ji, Cathy Zhou, 13-Mar-13, <draft-sarikaya-softwire-6rdmulticast-05.txt>

    This memo specifies 6rd's multicast component so that IPv6 hosts can
       receive multicast data from IPv6 servers.  In the 6rd encapsulation
       solution, multicast communication is completely integrated into the
       6rd tunnel.  In the 6rd translation solution, the protocol is based
       on proxying MLD at the 6rd Customer Edge router interworking the MLD
       messages to IGMP messages and sending them upstream through a network
       which supports IPv4 multicast.  The 6rd Border Relay is a multicast
       router and interworks the IGMP to MLD for onward propasgation toward
       the IPv6 multicast source.  IPv6 Multicast data received at 6rd
       Border Relay is translated into IPv4 multicast data and and delivered
       through the IPv4 multicast tree downstream to the 6rd Customer Edge.
       The latter translates it back to IPv6 multicast data then delivers it
       to the hosts.

  "RADIUS Extensions for Port Set Configuration and Reporting", Dean
  Cheng, Jouni Korhonen, Mohamed Boucadair, Senthil Sivakumar, 21-May-13,
  <draft-cheng-behave-cgn-cfg-radius-ext-05.txt>

    This document defines new RADIUS attributes that can be used by a
       device implementing port ranges to communicate with a RADIUS server
       to configure and/or report TCP/UDP port sets and ICMP identifiers
       mapping behavior for specific hosts.  This mechanism can be used in
       various deployment scenarios such as CGN, NAT64, Provider WiFi
       Gateway, etc.
    
       This document does not make any assumption about the deployment
       context.

  "A Taxonomy on Private Use Fields in Protocols", Chris Lonvick,
  23-Mar-13, <draft-lonvick-private-tax-07.txt>

    This document attempts to provide some clarification for the way that
       private use fields have been used in protocols developed in the IETF.
       It is strictly a taxonomy of what has been published and offers a
       minimal amount of advice about how to design or use private use
       options.

  "Multi-Segment Pseudowire Signaling with Availability Information", Hao
  Long, Min Ye, 18-Feb-13, <draft-long-pwe3-ms-pw-availability-01.txt>

    This document describes a signaling mechanism for setting up a
       multi-segment pseudowire between different domains in case that at
       least one domain has the feature that bandwidth capacity is variable
       for different availability values. The signaling mechanism is an
       extension on the multi-segment pseudowire signaling [DYN-MS-PW].

  "HTTP Origin and Hop Hints", Mark Nottingham, 11-Feb-13,
  <draft-nottingham-http-browser-hints-05.txt>

    Over time, HTTP clients -- especially Web browsers -- have adapted
       how they use the protocol based upon common server configurations and
       behaviours.  While this is necessary in the common case, it can be
       detrimental for performance and interoperability.
    
       This document establishes a mechanism whereby both origin servers and
       intermediaries can make hints available to clients about their
       preferences and capabilities, without imposing undue overhead on
       their interactions or requiring support for them.
    
       This is intended to allow clients to safely optimise connections to
       servers.

  "Inter-Carrier OAM Requirements", Michael Georgiades, Filippo Cugini,
  David Berechya, Oscar de Dios, 30-May-13,
  <draft-georgiades-opsawg-intercar-oam-req-04.txt>

    This draft specifies requirements for inter-carrier OAM supporting
       end-to-end OAM functionality and mechanisms development in a multi-
       operator environment. It reviews the already proposed OAM
       requirements addressed in IETF [RFC5706, RFC5860], ITU-T [Y.1730],MEF
       [MEFOAM] and IEEE [IEEE1, IEEE2] which were mainly proposed on a per
       transport technology basis, but aims to differentiate and focus on
       the requirements and additional requirements resulting from inter-
       operator considerations only.

  "File Transfer Protocol LOCK Command for Using a Single Port", Anthony
  Bryan, Daniel Stenberg, Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa, 1-Feb-13,
  <draft-bryan-ftp-lock-02.txt>

    One of the biggest hurdles for FTP in real life usage is its use of
       two connections.  First, it uses a primary connection to send control
       commands on, and when it sends or receives data, it opens a second
       TCP stream for that purpose.  This document specifies a new FTP LOCK
       command to be used by clients to request the server to use the
       control connection for data transfers, using a single port instead of
       two.

  "RTP Payload Format for G.711.0", Michael Ramalho, Paul Jones, Noboru
  Harada, Muthu Perumal, Miao Lei, 28-Mar-13,
  <draft-ramalho-payload-g7110-03.txt,.pdf>

    This document specifies the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)
       payload format for ITU-T Recommendation G.711.0.  ITU-T Rec.  G.711.0
       defines a lossless and stateless compression for G.711 packet
       payloads typically used in IP networks.  This document also defines a
       storage mode format for G.711.0 and a media type registration for the
       G.711.0 RTP payload format.

  "Home Agent Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6", Hidetoshi Yokota,
  Dae-Sun Kim, Behcet Sarikaya, Frank Xia, 20-Jun-13,
  <draft-yokota-mext-ha-init-flow-binding-05.txt>

    There are scenarios in which the home agent needs to trigger flow
       binding operations towards the mobile node such as moving a flow from
       one access network to another based on the network resource
       availability.  In order for the home agent to be able to initiate
       interactions for flow bindings with the mobile node, this document
       defines new signaling messages and sub-options for Mobile IPv6.  Home
       agent initiated flow bindings are supported for both IPv4 and IPv6
       enabled mobile nodes.

  "Requirements of GMPLS Extensions for Energy Efficient Traffic
  Engineering", Satoru Okamoto, 14-Mar-13,
  <draft-okamoto-ccamp-midori-gmpls-extension-reqs-02.txt>

    This document discusses some of extensions required in existing GMPLS
           OSPF routing protocol, RSVP signaling protocol, and LMP to support
           the energy efficient traffic engineering technology.

  "CoRE Resource Directory", Zach Shelby, Srdjan Krco, Carsten Bormann,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-shelby-core-resource-directory-05.txt>

    In many M2M applications, direct discovery of resources is not
       practical due to sleeping nodes, disperse networks, or networks where
       multicast traffic is inefficient.  These problems can be solved by
       employing an entity called a Resource Directory (RD), which hosts
       descriptions of resources held on other servers, allowing lookups to
       be performed for those resources.  This document specifies the web
       interfaces that a Resource Directory supports in order for web
       servers to discover the RD and to register, maintain, lookup and
       remove resources descriptions.  Furthermore, new link attributes
       useful in conjunction with an RD are defined.

  "Encoding of Data Structure (DS) in the Path Computation Element
  Communication Protocol (PCEP)", Dhruv Dhody, Udayasree Palle, 21-Feb-13,
  <draft-dhody-pce-pcep-ds-03.txt>

    The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label
       Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
       Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been
       identified as a key requirement for point-to-point (P2P) and point-
       to-multipoint (P2MP) scenarios.  Backward-Recursive Path Computation
       (BRPC) [RFC5441] defines Virtual Shortest Path Tree (VSPT) as a
       default de-facto data structure for path reply message in inter-
       domain scenarios.
    
       As Path Computation Element (PCE) will get used in newer scenarios
       like inter-domain, protection, P2MP etc.  As well as PCE is being
       explored to be used in Cross Stratrum Optimization (CSO) environment
       (see [CSO-PCE]) as well as in [ABNO].  Limiting PCE communication
       Protocol (PCEP) to just one data structure limits the usage of PCEP.
       Its important to keep PCEP generic enough to use differnt data
       structure and apply different algorithms.
    
       This document defines extensions to the PCEP to allow multiple data
       structures.  Extensions are defined for PCE to indicate the set of
       Data Structure (DS) it supports; also Path Computation Client (PCC)
       or PCE can indicate in a path computation request the required DS,
       and a PCE can report in a path computation reply the Data Structure
       that was used in the path reply message.

  "Supporting explicit inclusion or exclusion of abstract nodes for a
  subset of P2MP destinations in Path Computation Element Communication
  Protocol (PCEP).", Dhruv Dhody, Udayasree Palle, Venugopal Kondreddy,
  15-Apr-13, <draft-dhody-pce-pcep-p2mp-per-destination-04.txt>

    The ability to determine paths of point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
       Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
       Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) is one the key
       requirements for Path Computation Element (PCE).  [RFC6006] and
       [PCE-P2MP-PROCEDURES] describes these mechanisms for intra and inter
       domain path computation via PCE.
    
       This document describes the motivation and PCE communication Protocol
       (PCEP) extension for explicitly specifying abstract nodes for
       inclusion or exclusion for a subset of destinations during the Point
       to Multipoint (P2MP) path computation via PCE.

  "Security Framework for Virtualized Data Center Services", Suren
  Karavettil, Bhumip Khasnabish, So Ning, Wei Dong, 26-Dec-12,
  <draft-karavettil-vdcs-security-framework-05.txt>

    This document discusses the requirements and technology gaps related
    to security in the virtualized data center services (VDCS).  The
    objective is to ensure end-to-end security for various types of
    carrier services built on virtualized infrastructure.  The issues
    covered in this draft are focused on confidentiality and integrity of
    the services in the virtualized environment; including but not
    limited to infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and application
    (SaaS) services.  This draft also takes into account transient nature
    of identity, resources and connectivity in the virtualized
    environment.

  "One Hop Lookups Algorithm Plugin for RELOAD", Jin Peng, Yu Qing, Yuan
  Li, 18-Feb-13, <draft-peng-p2psip-one-hop-plugin-03.txt>

    This document defines a specific Topology Plugin using a ramification
           of the basic One Hop Lookups based DHT algorithm which is called ONE-
           HOP-RELOAD. In the One Hop Lookups algorithm, each peer maintains a
           full routing table containing information about every node on the
           overlay in order to route RELOAD message in one hop. Compared with
           CHORD-RELOAD algorithm, ONE-HOP-RELOAD improves the routing
           efficiency, and can maintain complete membership information with
           reasonable bandwidth requirements. This algorithm is able to handle
           frequent membership changes by superimposing a well-defined hierarchy
           on the system that guarantees topology disturbance events
           notification reach every peer in the overlay within a specified
           amount of time. Currently some typical peer-to-peer storages systems
           have stringent latency requirements, such as Amazon's Dynamo which is
           built for latency sensitive applications uses One-Hop algorithm, so
           that each node maintains enough routing information locally to route
           a request to the appropriate node directly.

  "Proposals for RELOAD to support Promotion and Demotion for User-owned
  Nodes", Jin Peng, Deng Lingli, Lifeng Le, Gang Li, Xiao Ma, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-peng-p2psip-promotion-02.txt>

    This document proposes extensions to RELOAD to support flexible
       client promotion and demotion modes.  RELOAD aims at providing a
       uniform protocol for both overlay clients and peers, where promotion
       of a client to peer is triggered and completed at the client's
       pleasure.  It is proposed that RELOAD provide a more restrictive
       framework to enable passive promotion and demotion, where decisions
       are made by the network rather than individual user-owned nodes.

  "RBridges: TRILL Link Data Optimizations", Radia Perlman, Donald
  Eastlake, Li Yizhou, Anoop Ghanwani, 7-Jan-13,
  <draft-perlman-trill-rbridge-data-encoding-03.txt>

    TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) Data frames can
       be encoded so as to make more efficient use of communications links
       under certain circumstances.  This document specifies two such
       optional optimizations.  One, called Compact Format, improves the
       compactness of encoding where a TRILL link is a point-to-point
       Ethernet link.  The other, called Specific Addressing, optionally
       decreases the burden on multi-access TRILL links for multi-
       destination TRILL Data frames. This document updates RFC 6325.

  "In-Band Authentication Extension for Protocol Independent Multicast",
  Manav Bhatia, Dacheng Zhang, Bharat Joshi, 27-Mar-13,
  <draft-bhatia-zhang-pim-auth-extension-03.txt>

    Existing security mechanisms for the Protocol Independent Multicast -
       Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) routing protocol mandates the use of IPsec to
       provide message authenticity and integrity.  This draft proposes an
       embedded authentication mechanism to facilitate data origin
       authentication and integrity verification for PIM packets in the
       cases where IPsec cannot be applied.

  "User-Managed Access (UMA) Profile of OAuth 2.0", Thomas Hardjono,
  27-Dec-12, <draft-hardjono-oauth-umacore-06.txt>

    User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0.  UMA defines how
       resource owners can control access to their protected resources made
       by clients operated by arbitrary rquesting parties, where the
       resources reside on any number of resource servers, and where a
       centralized authorization server governs access based on resource
       owner policy.

  "Motivation for developing Stateless Automatic IPv4 over IPv6
  Encapsulation / Decapsulation Technology (SA46T)", Naoki Matsuhira,
  6-Jan-13, <draft-matsuhira-sa46t-motivation-03.txt>

    This document describe a motivation for developing IPv4 over IPv6
       encapsulation / decapsulation solution from standing position of
       Stateless Autimatic IPv4 over IPv6 Encapsulation / Decapsulation
       Technology (SA46T) and SA46T with address sharing (SA46T-AS).

  "Cisco Specific Information Elements reused in IPFIX", Andrew
  Yourtchenko, Paul Aitken, Benoit Claise, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-yourtchenko-cisco-ies-05.txt>

    This document describes some additional Information Elements of Cisco
       Systems, Inc. that are not listed in RFC3954.

  "RO Extensions for PMIPv6-LR (ROEXT)", Michael Boc, Christophe
  Janneteau, Alexandru Petrescu, 22-Apr-13,
  <draft-boc-netext-lr-roext-05.txt>

    The communication path between two Hosts within a Proxy Mobile IPv6
       domain is artificially long - it involves the LMA, even if straight
       paths exist (under same MAG, or MAG-to-MAG).  Localized Routing
       PMIPv6-LR concepts developped by NETEXT WG make use of LRI/LRA
       messages to achieve optimized MAG-to-MAG straight paths.  This may
       prove inconvenient for the network operator, in that it may loose
       ability to control traffic (LMA control point is skipped).
    
       In this draft we present a middle-ground solution.  It employs new
       Intermediary Anchors (IAs) in the paths between MAGs and offers
       points of control of traffic useful for QoS and lawful interception.

  "Best Practices for HTTP-CoAP Mapping Implementation", Angelo
  Castellani, Salvatore Loreto, Akbar Rahman, Thomas Fossati, Esko Dijk,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-castellani-core-http-mapping-07.txt>

    This draft provides reference information for HTTP-CoAP protocol
       translation proxy implementors, focusing primarily on the reverse
       proxy case.  It details deployment options, discusses possible
       approaches for URI mapping, and provides a set of guidelines and
       considerations related to protocol translation.

  "Some Measurements on World IPv6 Day from End-User Perspective", Ari
  Keranen, Jari Arkko, 11-Sep-12,
  <draft-keranen-ipv6day-measurements-04.txt>

    During the World IPv6 Day on June 8th, 2011, several key content
       providers enabled their networks to offer both IPv4 and IPv6
       services.  Hundreds of organizations participated in this effort, and
       in the months and weeks leading up to the event worked hard on
       preparing their networks to support this event.  The event was
       largely unnoticed by the general public, which is a good thing since
       it means that no major problems were detected.  For the Internet,
       however, there was a major change on such a small timescale.  This
       memo discusses measurements that the authors made from the
       perspective of an end-user with good IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity.  Our
       measurements include the number of most popular networks providing
       AAAA records for their service as well as delay and connection
       failure statistics.

  "Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond web (ABFAB) Usability
  and User Interface Considerations", Rhys Smith, 8-Jan-13,
  <draft-smith-abfab-usability-ui-considerations-03.txt>

    The use of ABFAB-based technologies requires that each user's device
       is configured with the user's identities that they wish to use in
       ABFAB transactions.  This will require something on that device,
       either built into the operating system or a standalone utility, that
       will manage the user's identities and identity to service mappings.
       Anyone designing that "something" will face the same set of
       challenges.  This document aims to document these challenges with the
       aim of producing well-thought out UIs with some degree of
       consistency.

  "BGPSEC Design Choices and Summary of Supporting Discussions",
  Kotikalapudi Sriram, 6-Jan-13,
  <draft-sriram-bgpsec-design-choices-03.txt>

    This document has been written to capture the design rationale for
       the individual draft-00 version of BGPSEC protocol specification
       (I-D.lepinski-bgpsec-protocol-00).  It lists the decisions that were
       made in favor of or against each design choice, and presents brief
       summaries of the arguments that aided the decision process.  A
       similar document can be published in the future as the BGPSEC design
       discussions make further progress and additional design
       considerations are discussed and finalized.

  "Context Transfer Protocol Extension for Multicast", DH, Hitoshi Asaeda,
  12-Feb-13, <draft-vonhugo-multimob-cxtp-extension-03.txt>

    This document describes an extension of the Context Transfer Protocol
       (CXTP) to support seamless IP multicast services with Proxy Mobile
       IPv6 (PMIPv6).

  "Mediated RSA cryptography specification for additive private key
  splitting (mRSAA)", Miroslaw Kutylowski, Przemyslaw Kubiak, Michal
  Tabor, Daniel Wachnik, 5-Nov-12,
  <draft-kutylowski-mrsa-algorithm-03.txt>

    This document describes recommendations for the implementation of
    public key cryptography based on the mediated RSA algorithm. The
    Mediated RSA algorithm bases on fragmentation of a private key. As a
    result the signature process consists from multiple stages. The
    verification process is the same as in the case of RSA algorithm
    [RFC3447].

  "The Universal Voting Markup Language (UVML)", Erin Phillips, 11-Jan-13,
  <draft-phillips-uvml-03.txt>

    This document describes the Universal Voting Markup Language (UVML),
       a syntax for the structured representation of opinion in free text.
       Using UVML, opinions can be encoded in text, image, or video, and
       reliably interpreted by either human readers or automated-agents.
       UVML supports both rating and ranking semantics.  Ratings may be
       scored using symbols associated with the five most commonly used
       opinion dimensions: quality(*), importance(!), outlook($), support-
       opposition(+), and likelihood(%).  In addition, UVML defines a syntax
       for optionally including a demographic signature by which voters can
       publish basic demographic information with their UVML votes.  The
       design of UVML leverages cross-cultural sentiment and voting-systems
       scholarship.

  "PW Endpoint Fast Failure Protection", Yimin Shen, Rahul Aggarwal, Wim
  Henderickx, 8-Feb-13, <draft-shen-pwe3-endpoint-fast-protection-03.txt>

    This document specifies a fast mechanism for protecting pseudowires
       (PWs) against egress endpoint failures, including egress attachment
       circuit failure, egress PE failure, multi-segment PW terminating PE
       failure, and multi-segment PW switching PE failure.  Designed on the
       basis of multi-homed CE, PW redundancy, upstream label assignment and
       context specific label switching, the mechanism enables local repair
       to be performed by a router upstream adjacent to a failure.  In
       particular, the router can restore PW traffic in the order of tens of
       milliseconds, by transmitting the traffic to a protector through a
       pre-established bypass tunnel.  Therefore, the mechanism can be used
       to reduce traffic loss before a global repair mechanism reacts to the
       failure or the network converges on the topology changes due to the
       failure.

  "Generalized Label for Super-Channel Assignment on Flexible Grid",
  Iftekhar Hussain, Zhong Pan, Marco Sosa, Andrew Malis, Abinder Dhillon,
  13-Apr-13, <draft-hussain-ccamp-super-channel-label-05.txt>

    To enable scaling of existing transport systems to ultra high data
       rates of 1 Tbps and beyond, next generation systems providing super-
       channel switching capability are currently being developed. To allow
       efficient allocation of optical spectral bandwidth for such high bit
       rate systems, International Telecommunication Union
       Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is extending the
       G.694.1 grid standard (termed "Fixed-Grid") to include flexible grid
       (termed "Flex-Grid") support (draft revised ITU-T G.694.1, revision
       1.4, Oct 2011). This necessitates definition of new label format for
       the Flex-Grid. This document defines a super-channel label as a
       Super-Channel Identifier and an associated list of 12.5 GHz slices
       representing the optical spectrum of the super-channel. The label
       information can be encoded using a fixed length or variable length
       format. This label format can be used in GMPLS signaling and routing
       protocol to establish super-channel based optical label switched
       paths (LSPs).

    This document clarifies and updates several requirements of RFC4787,
       RFC5382 and RFC5508 based on operational and development experience.
       The focus of this document is NAPT44.

  "Energy Management Terminology", John Parello, 23-Apr-13,
  <draft-parello-eman-definitions-08.txt>

    This document contains definitions and terms used in
            the Energy Management Working Group. Each term
            contains a definition(s), example, and reference to a
            normative, informative or well know source. Terms
            originating in this draft should be either composed of
            or adapted from other terms in the draft with a
            source. The defined terms will then be used in other
            drafts as defined here.

  "The Interior Routing Overlay Network (IRON)", Fred Templin, 3-May-13,
  <draft-templin-ironbis-15.txt>

    Since large-scale Internetworks such as the public Internet must
       continue to support escalating growth due to increasing demand, it is
       clear that Autonomous Systems (ASes) must avoid injecting excessive
       de-aggregated prefixes into the interdomain routing system and
       instead mitigate de-aggregation internally.  This document describes
       an Interior Routing Overlay Network (IRON) architecture that supports
       sustainable growth within AS-interior routing domains while requiring
       no changes to end systems and no changes to the exterior routing
       system.  In addition to routing scaling, IRON further addresses other
       important issues including mobility management, mobile networks,
       multihoming, traffic engineering, NAT traversal and security.  While
       business considerations are an important determining factor for
       widespread adoption, they are out of scope for this document.

  "Security Labels in Internet Email", Kurt Zeilenga, Alexey Melnikov,
  4-Apr-13, <draft-zeilenga-email-seclabel-05.txt>

       Internet Mail to convey the sensitivity of the message.  This header
       field which may carry a textual representation (a display marking)
       and/or a structural representation (a security label) of the
       sensitivity of the message.  This document also describes a header
       field, SIO-Label-History, for recording changes in the message's
       label.

  "VXLAN: A Framework for Overlaying Virtualized Layer 2 Networks over
  Layer 3 Networks", Mallik Mahalingam, Dinesh Dutt, Kenneth Duda, Puneet
  Agarwal, Lawrence Kreeger, T. Sridhar, Mike Bursell, Chris Wright,

           scheme and the related protocols can be used in cloud service
           provider and enterprise data center networks.

  "The proposal of A Uniform Resource Name (URN) Formal Namespace for the
  Local Government ICT Platform Project in Japan", Kazuaki Ohara,
  7-Jun-13, <draft-kanazawa-applic-urn-02.txt>

    This document describes the Namespace Idendifier (NID) 'applic' for
     Uniform Resource Name (URN) which is used to identify resources
     released by the Association for Promotion of Public Local Information
     and Communication (APPLIC).  APPLIC publishes and manages
     specifications that define unique and persistent resources which make
     use of the namespace.
     (APPLIC is a nonprofit organization which consists of local
     governments, private companies and academic experts in Japan.)

  "Extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
  (PCEP) to compute service aware Label Switched Path (LSP).", Dhruv
  Dhody, Vishwas Manral, Zafar Ali, George Swallow, Kenji Kumaki,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-dhody-pce-pcep-service-aware-05.txt>

    In certain networks like financial information network (stock/
       commodity trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications,
       Latency (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet loss is
       becoming a key requirement for path computation along with other
       constraints and metrics.  Latency, Latency-Variation and Packet Loss
       is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between
       customers and service providers.
    
       [MPLS-DELAY-FWK] describes MPLS architecture to allow Latency
       (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet loss as properties.
       [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS] describes mechanisms with
       which network performance information is distributed via OSPF and
       ISIS respectively.  This document describes the extension to PCEP to
       carry Latency, Latency-Variation and Loss as constraints for end to
       end path computation.

  "NVGRE: Network Virtualization using Generic Routing Encapsulation",
  Murari Sridharan, Albert Greenberg, Narasimhan Venkataramaiah, Yu-Shun
  Wang, Kenneth Duda, Ilango Ganga, Geng Lin, Mark Pearson, Patricia
  Thaler, Chait Tumuluri, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-sridharan-virtualization-nvgre-02.txt>

    This document describes the usage of Generic Routing Encapsulation
       (GRE) header for Network Virtualization (NVGRE) in multi-tenant
       datacenters. Network Virtualization decouples virtual networks and
       addresses from physical network infrastructure, providing isolation
       and concurrency between multiple virtual networks on the same
       physical network infrastructure. This document also introduces a
       Network Virtualization framework to illustrate the use cases, but
       the focus is on specifying the data plane aspect of NVGRE.

  "SA46T Multicast Support", Naoki Matsuhira, 30-Mar-13,
  <draft-matsuhira-sa46t-mcast-03.txt>

    This document describe Stateless Automatic IPv4 over IPv6
       Encapsulation / Decapsutation Technology (SA46T) multicast support.
       IPv4 multicast is supported by SA46T with same manner with IPv4
       unicast.  SA46T multicast address prefix is defined.

  "Deterministic Address Mapping to Reduce Logging in Carrier Grade NAT
  Deployments", Chris Donley, Chris Grundemann, Vikas Sarawat, Karthik
  Sundaresan, Olivier Vautrin, 12-Jan-13,
  <draft-donley-behave-deterministic-cgn-05.txt>

    In some instances, Service Providers have a legal logging requirement
       to be able to map a subscriber's inside address with the address used
       on the public Internet (e.g. for abuse response).  Unfortunately,
       many Carrier Grade NAT logging solutions require active logging of
       dynamic translations.  Carrier Grade NAT port assignments are often
       per-connection, but could optionally use port ranges.  Research
       indicates that per-connection logging is not scalable in many
       residential broadband services.  This document suggests a way to
       manage Carrier Grade NAT translations in such a way as to
       significantly reduce the amount of logging required while providing
       traceability for abuse response.  While the authors acknowledge that
       IPv6 is a preferred solution, Carrier Grade NAT is a reality in many
       networks, and is needed in situations where either customer equipment
       or Internet content only supports IPv4; this approach should in no
       way slow the deployment of IPv6.

  "TFRC-based Congestion Control for Saratoga", Wesley Eddy, Lloyd Wood,
  Will Ivancic, 21-Apr-13, <draft-eddy-tsvwg-saratoga-tfrc-03.txt>

    This document specifies the use of TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC)
       with the Saratoga data transfer protocol.  The necessary conventions
       that a Saratoga sender and receiver implementation must follow if
       they wish to enable the use of TFRC are described.

  "Congestion control for the Saratoga protocol", Lloyd Wood, Wesley Eddy,
  Will Ivancic, 21-Apr-13,
  <draft-wood-tsvwg-saratoga-congestion-control-03.txt>

    Saratoga is a data transfer protocol designed to carry potentially
       large volumes of data over difficult network paths, often including
       only a single high-rate link and only one application flow.  As the
       requirements for use vary across deployment environments, the base
       Saratoga specification only assumes that an implementation will be
       able to clock packets out at a configurable rate, and beyond this
       specifies no inherent or particular congestion-control behaviour.
       The design of Saratoga deliberately supports the integration of
       congestion-control algorithms without modification to the base
       protocol.  This document describes how congestion control can be
       supported in the Saratoga transfer protocol.  Saratoga is intended
       for use in private networks, where its use is engineered as a single
       flow to fill a link.  However, as Saratoga is implemented over UDP,
       it can be multiplexed, and can be run across the public Internet, in
       which case congestion control in accordance with the UDP Guidelines
       becomes necessary.

  "DHCP Options for 3GPP Service", Guoyan Liu, Yangwei Tu, Chunhui Zhu,
  Wim Henderickx, Daniel Derksen, Laurent Thiebaut, 12-Mar-13,
  <draft-liu-dhc-3gpp-option-03.txt>

    This document defines a new option that can be used by DHCP clients
       in their signaling sent to DHCP servers, when those clients need to
       associate a request for an IP address or IPv6 prefix with a given
       3GPP packet service.It is intended for scenarios of interworking
       between a non-3GPP access and a 3GPP network.

  "HO from 3GPP to a trusted non-3GPP access", Guoyan Liu, Yangwei Tu,
  Chunhui Zhu, 15-Feb-13, <draft-liu-dhc-ho-03.txt>

    This document adds DHCP client and server behavior description in a
       scenario for handover from 3GPP to a trusted non-3GPP access.

  "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Schema for Printer
  Services", Pat Fleming, Ira McDonald, 17-May-13,
  <draft-mcdonald-ldap-printer-schema-04.txt>

    This document defines a schema, object classes and attributes, for
       Printers and Print Services, for use with directories that support
       Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (RFC 4510).  This document is
       based on the Printer attributes listed in Appendix E of Internet
       Printing Protocol/1.1 (IPP) (RFC 2911).  Additional Printer
       attributes are based on definitions in the Printer MIB v2 (RFC 3805),
       IEEE-ISTO PWG Command Set for IEEE 1284 Device ID (PWG 5107.2),
       IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 (PWG 5100.13),
       and IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP Everywhere (PWG 5100.14).
    
       This document is published by the IETF on behalf of the Internet
       Printing Protocol Working Group of the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working
       Group.
    
       This document updates RFC 3712.

  "IPv6 Prefix Assignment in Small Networks", Fred Baker, Ralph Droms,
  7-Mar-12, <draft-baker-homenet-prefix-assignment-01.txt>

    It is necessary to allocate prefixes in small networks, which include
       residential and Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) networks in a manner
       that minimizes or eliminates manual configuration.  This note
       suggests an approach.

  "IANA Allocated DNS RRtype Codes Without Documentation", Edward Lewis,
  13-Oct-11, <draft-lewis-dns-undocumented-types-01.txt>

    In the IANA registry of Resource Record (RR) TYPEs, as of October 1,
    2011, there are 10 type code values allocated with references that
    are individual email boxes and not stable documents.  Some of the
    registrations represent works in progress and such a reference is
    viable.  Some registrations are dormant or dead efforts.  In all
    cases it would be helpful to have some reference to material
    describing the type.

  "LDP Bindings Refresh", Andre Pelletier, Kamran Raza, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-pelletier-mpls-ldp-bindings-refresh-02.txt>

    There are situations when there is a need for performing consistency
      checks for LDP binding state (address/label bindings) exchanged
      between LDP speakers. For instance, a state refresh may be required
      to detect and purge stale bindings received by an LDP speaker, which
      have resulted from an in-service software upgrade. This document
      specifies mechanics that allow a sender LDP speaker to enclose the
      initial binding advertisements (or re-advertisements) between
      explicit START and END of binding markers, thus helping the
      receiving LDP speaker to detect and purge any extra/stale binding
      state previously learnt from the sender. In addition to the
      definition of new LDP Notification message status codes for bindings
      refresh, this document also extends LDP base specification by
      introducing the concept of "Wildcard Address" and a new "Wildcard
      Address Request" message.

  "Generalized Labels for the Flexi-Grid in Lambda Switch Capable (LSC)
  Label Switching Routers", Daniel King, Adrian Farrel, Yao Li, 9-Apr-13,
  <draft-farrkingel-ccamp-flexigrid-lambda-label-06.txt>

    GMPLS supports the description of optical switching by identifying
       entries in fixed lists of switchable wavelengths (called grids)
       through the encoding of lambda labels.  Work within the ITU-T Study
       Group 15 has defined a finer granularity grid, and the facility to
       flexibly select different widths of spectrum from the grid.  This
       document defines a new GMPLS lambda label format to support this
       flexi-grid.
    
       This document updates RFC 3471 and RFC 6205 by introducing a new
       label format.

  "IS-IS Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions", Stefano Previdi,
  Spencer Giacalone, David Ward, John Drake, Alia Atlas, Clarence
  Filsfils, 25-Feb-13, <draft-previdi-isis-te-metric-extensions-03.txt>

    In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
       information networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network
       performance criteria (e.g. latency) are becoming as critical to data
       path selection as other metrics.
    
       This document describes extensions to IS-IS TE [RFC5305] such that
       network performance information can be distributed and collected in a
       scalable fashion.  The information distributed using ISIS TE Metric
       Extensions can then be used to make path selection decisions based on
       network performance.
    
       Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which network
       performance information is distributed.  The mechanisms for measuring
       network performance or acting on that information, once distributed,
       are outside the scope of this document.

  "Multiple RTP Sessions on a Single Lower-Layer Transport", Magnus
  Westerlund, Colin Perkins, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-westerlund-avtcore-transport-multiplexing-05.txt>

    This memo defines a mechanism to allow multiple RTP sessions to be
       multiplexed onto a single lower-layer transport flow (e.g., onto a
       single UDP 5-tuple).  Requirements for multiplexing RTP sessions are
       discussed, along with the trade-off between the different options.  A
       shim-based multiplexing layer is proposed, along with associated
       signalling.

  "Securing Header Fields with S/MIME", Laurent Cailleux, Chris Bonatti,
  10-Jan-13, <draft-cailleux-secure-headers-02.txt>

    This document describes how the S/MIME protocol can be
      extended in order to secure message header fields. This
      technology provides security services such as data integrity,
      non-repudiation and confidentiality. This extension is
      referred to as 'Secure Headers'.

  "PCP Support for Nested NAT Environments", Reinaldo Penno, Dan Wing,
  Mohamed Boucadair, 21-Jan-13, <draft-penno-pcp-nested-nat-03.txt>

    Nested NATs or multi-layer NATs are already widely deployed.  They
       are characterized by two or more NAT devices in the path of packets
       from the subscriber to the Internet.  Moreover, NAT devices current
       deployed are PCP unaware and It is assumed that NAT aware PCP devices
       will take a long time to be rolled out.  Therefore in order to lower
       the adoption barrier of PCP and make it work for current deployed
       networks, this document proposes a few mechanisms for PCP-enabled
       applications to work through NATs with varying levels of PCP protocol
       support.

  "Multicast Support for MAP-E", Behcet Sarikaya, 19-Feb-13,
  <draft-sarikaya-softwire-4rdmulticast-06.txt>

    This memo specifies MAP-E (together with MAP-T and 4rd)'s multicast
       component so that IPv4 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4
       servers over an IPv6 network.  In the encapsulation solution for
       encapsulation variant of Mapping of Address and Port (MAP), MAP-E,
       IGMP Proxy at the MAP-E Customer Edge router uses IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel
       established by MAP-E to exchange IGMP messages to establish multicast
       state at MAP-E Border Relay so that MAP-E Border Relay can tunnel
       IPv4 multicast data to IPv4 hosts connected to MAP-E Customer Edge
       device.  In the Translation Multicast solution for the translation
       variant of MAP, MAP-T and 4rd, IGMP messages are translated into MLD
       messages at the CE router which is IGMP/MLD Proxy and sent to the
       network in IPv6.  MAP-T/4rd Border Relay does the reverse translation
       and joins IPv4 multicast group for MAP-T/4rd hosts.  Border Relay as
       multicast router receives IPv4 multicast data and translates the
       packet into IPv6 multicast data and sends downstream on the multicast
       tree.  Member CEs receive multicast data, translate it back to IPv4
       and transmit to the hosts.

  "Negotiation for Keying Pairwise Routing Protocols in IKEv2", Mahesh
  Jethanandani, Brian Weis, Keyur Patel, Dacheng Zhang, Sam Hartman, Uma
  Chunduri, Albert Tian, Joseph Touch, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-mahesh-karp-rkmp-04.txt>

    This document describes a mechanism to secure the routing protocols
       which use unicast to transport their signaling messages.  Most of
       such routing protocols are TCP-based (e.g., BGP and LDP), and the TCP
       Authentication Option (TCP-AO) is primarily employed for securing the
       signaling messages of these routing protocols.  There are also two
       exceptions: BFD which is over UDP or MPLS, and RSVP-TE which is over
       IP (but employs an integrated approach to protecting the signaling
       messages instead of using IPsec).  The proposed mechanism secures
       pairwise TCP-based Routing Protocol (RP) associations, BFD
       associations and RSVP-TE associations using the IKEv2 Key Management
       Protocol (KMP) integrated with TCP-AO, BFD, and RSVP-TE respectively.
       Included are extensions to IKEv2 and its Security Associations to
       enable its key negotiation to support TCP-AO, BFD, and RSVP-TE.

  "Reactions to Signaling from ECN Support for RTP/RTCP", Ken Carlberg,
  Piers O'Hanlon, 8-Mar-13, <draft-carlberg-tsvwg-ecn-reactions-04.txt>

    This document presents an examination of various responses to Congestion
    Experience (CE) notifications by real time applications that have
    negotiated end-to-end support of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).
    This document is a follow-on effort of [rfc6679], which specifies the
    signaling used to provide ECN support for RTP/RTCP flows.

  "DHCPv6 class based prefix", Cisco Systems, Gaurav Halwasia, Sri
  Gundavelli, Hui Deng, Laurent Thiebaut, Jouni Korhonen, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix-04.txt>

    This document introduces options to communicate property and
       associate metadata with prefixes.  It extends DHCPv6 prefix
       delegation and address allocation using the metadata for selection of
       prefixes and addresses.

  "Guidance of Using Unique Local Addresses", Bing Liu, Sheng Jiang,
  Cameron Byrne, 25-Feb-13, <draft-liu-v6ops-ula-usage-analysis-05.txt>

    This document provides guidance of how to use ULA. It analyzes ULA
       usage scenarios and recommends use cases where ULA address may be
       beneficially used.

  "Extended IPv6 Addressing for Encoding Port Range", Congxiao Bao, Xing
  Li, 31-Dec-12, <draft-bcx-behave-address-fmt-extension-03.txt>

    This document discusses an extension of the algorithmic translation
       between IPv4 and IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.  The extended
       address format contains transport-layer port set identification
       (PSID) which allows several IPv6 nodes to share a single IPv4 address
       with each node managing a different range of ports.  This address
       format extension can be used for IPv4/IPv6 translation, as well as
       IPv4 over IPv6 tunneling.

  "OSPF Topology-Transparent Zone", Huaimo Chen, Renwei Li, Gregory
  Cauchie, So Ning, Lei Liu, Alvaro Retana, 3-May-13,
  <draft-chen-ospf-ttz-05.txt>

    This document presents a topology-transparent zone in a domain.  A
       topology-transparent zone comprises a group of routers and a number
       of links connecting these routers.  Any router outside of the zone is
       not aware of the zone.  The information about the links and routers
       inside the zone is not distributed to any router outside of the zone.
       Any link state change such as a link down inside the zone is not seen
       by any router outside of the zone.

  "Directory Assisted TRILL Encapsulation", Linda Dunbar, Donald Eastlake,
  Radia Perlman, Igor Gashinsky, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-dunbar-trill-directory-assisted-encap-03.txt>

    This draft describes how data center network can benefit from non-
    RBridge nodes performing TRILL encapsulation with assistance from
    directory service.

  "Prefix Assignment in a Home Network", Jari Arkko, Acee Lindem, Benjamin
  Paterson, 23-May-13, <draft-arkko-homenet-prefix-assignment-04.txt>

    This memo describes a prefix assignment mechanism for home networks.
       It is expected that home gateway routers are allocated an IPv6 prefix
       through DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (PD) or that a prefix is made
       available through other means.  This prefix needs to be divided among
       the multiple subnets in a home network.  This memo describes a
       mechanism for such division, or assignment, via OSPFv3.  This is an
       alternative design to also using DHCPv6 PD for the assignment.  The
       memo is input to the working group so that it can make a decision on
       which type of design to pursue.  It is expected that a routing-
       protocol based assignment uses a minimal amount of prefixes.

  "Transport of CoAP over SMS, USSD and GPRS", Markus Becker, Kepeng Li,
  Koojana Kuladinithi, Thomas Poetsch, 4-Feb-13,
  <draft-becker-core-coap-sms-gprs-03.txt>

    The Short Message Service (SMS) and Unstructured Supplementary
       Service Data (USSD) of mobile cellular networks is frequently used in
       Machine-To-Machine (M2M) communications, such as for telematic
       devices.  The service offers small packet sizes and high delays just
       as other typical low-power and lossy networks (LLNs), i.e. 6LoWPANs.
       The design of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), that took
       the limitations of LLNs into account, is thus also applicable to
       telematic M2M devices.  The adaptation of CoAP to the SMS or USSD
       transport mechanisms and the combination with IP transported over
       cellular networks is described in this document.

  "IS-IS Extended Sequence number TLV", Uma Chunduri, Wenhu Lu, Albert
  Tian, Naiming Shen, 18-Jan-13,
  <draft-chunduri-isis-extended-sequence-no-tlv-04.txt>

    This document defines Extended Sequence number TLV to protect
       Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) PDUs from replay
       attacks.

  "KARP IS-IS security gap analysis", Uma Chunduri, Albert Tian, Wenhu Lu,
  16-Jan-13, <draft-chunduri-karp-is-is-gap-analysis-04.txt>

    This document analyzes the threats applicable for Intermediate system
       to Intermediate system (IS-IS) routing protocol and security gaps
       according to the KARP Design Guide.  This document also provides
       specific requirements to address the gaps with both manual and auto
       key management protocols.

  "A framework for RPs to use IKEv2 KMP", Uma Chunduri, Albert Tian,
  Joseph Touch, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-chunduri-karp-using-ikev2-with-tcp-ao-04.txt>

    This document describes a mechanism to secure pairwise Routing
       Protocol associations using the IKEv2 Key Management Protocol (KMP).
       Most of the pairwise Routing Protocols (RPs) are TCP-based but the
       framework described here is applicable to other pairwise RPs, which
       not necessarily use the TCP at transport layer.  A Gatekeeper
       mechanism is introduced to allow all pairwise RPs to coordinate with
       IKEv2 Protocol to pass the policy, get the keying material and to
       maintain the security associations.  The Gatekeeper also allows
       pairwise RPs which use TCP-AO to coordinate with IKEv2 without
       fundamental modification to either.

  <draft-dhillon-ccamp-super-channel-ospfte-ext-05.txt>

    This document specifies the extension to TELINK LSA of OSPF routing
       protocol [RFC4203] [3] in support of GMPLS [1] for flex-grid
       networks [2].

  "IP VPN Scaling Considerations", Wesley George, Rob Shakir, 21-Dec-12,
  <draft-gs-vpn-scaling-02.txt>

    This document discusses scaling considerations unique to
       implementation of Layer 3 (IP) Virtual Private Networks, discusses a
       few best practices, and identifies gaps in the current tools and
       techniques which are making it more difficult for operators to cost-
       effectively scale and manage their L3VPN deployments.

  "Internet Exchange Route Server Operations", Nick Hilliard, Elisa
  Jasinska, Robert Raszuk, Niels Bakker, 7-Jun-13,
  <draft-hilliard-ix-bgp-route-server-operations-03.txt>

    The popularity of Internet exchange points (IXPs) brings new
       challenges to interconnecting networks.  While bilateral eBGP
       sessions between exchange participants were historically the most
       common means of exchanging reachability information over an IXP, the
       overhead associated with this interconnection method causes serious
       operational and administrative scaling problems for IXP participants.
    
       Multilateral interconnection using Internet route servers can
       dramatically reduce the administrative and operational overhead of
       IXP participation and these systems used by many IXP participants as
       a preferred means of exchanging routing information.
    
       This document describes operational considerations for multilateral
       interconnections at IXPs.

  "MPLS-TP protection for interconnected rings", Guoman Liu, Masahiro
  Daikoku, Takeshi Maruyama, 22-Apr-13,
  <draft-liu-mpls-tp-interconnected-ring-protection-04.txt>

    The requirements for MPLS Transport Profile include a requirement
       (R93) that requires MPLS-TP must support recovery mechanisms for a
       network constructed from interconnected rings that protect user data
       that traverses more than one ring.  In particular, This includes
       protecting against cases of failure at the ring-interconnect nodes
       and links.  This document presents different scenario of
       interconnected rings and special mechanism to address recovery of the
       failure of ring-interconnect nodes and links.  .
    
       This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
       Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
       Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include
       an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
       to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
       network as defined by the ITU-T.

  "Application Bridging for Federation Beyond the Web (ABFAB) Trust Router
  Protocol", Margaret Wasserman, Sam Hartman, Josh Howlett, 27-Feb-13,
  <draft-mrw-abfab-trust-router-02.txt>

    A Trust Router is an infrastucture element used to construct multihop
    Application Bridging for Federated Authentication Beyond the Web
    (ABFAB) federations.  This document defines both the Trust Router
    Protocol and the Temporary Identity Protocol, which can be used
    together to enable multihop ABFAB federations without requiring a
    centralized Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

  "Using Simulcast in RTP Sessions", Magnus Westerlund, BoB, Morgan
  Lindqvist, Fredrik Jansson, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-westerlund-avtcore-rtp-simulcast-02.txt>

    In some applications it may be necessary to send multiple media
       encodings derived from the same media source in independent RTP media
       streams.  This is called Simulcast.  This document discusses the best
       way of accomplishing this in RTP and how to signal it in SDP.  It is
       concluded that a solution where the different simulcast versions are
       based on separate SDP media descriptions provides best support for
       simulcast.  A solution is defined by making two extensions to SDP.
       The first extension consists of two new attributes in SDP that
       express capability to send or receive simulcast streams,
       respectively.  The second extension describes how to group media
       descriptions belonging to the same simulcast source by using the
       grouping framework.

  "Cross Stratum Optimization Architecture for Optical as a Service", Hui
  Yang, Yongli Zhao, Jie Zhang, Chunhui Lv, Young Lee, Yi Lin, Fatai
  Zhang, 1-Jan-13, <draft-yangh-cso-oaas-03.txt>

    Data centers based applications provide a wide variety of services
       such as cloud computing, video gaming, grid application and others.
       Currently application decisions are made with little information
       concerning underlying network used to deliver those services so that
       such decisions cannot be the most optimal from both network and
       application resource utilization and quality of service objectives.
    
       This document presents a novel architecture of Cross Stratum
       Optimization for application and network resource in dynamic optical
       networks.  Several global load balancing strategies are proposed and
       demonstrated by experiments in Optical as a Service experimental
       environment.

  "Problem Statement: TRILL Active/Active Edge", Mingui Zhang, Donald
  Eastlake, 17-Feb-13, <draft-zhang-trill-aggregation-03.txt>

    This document specifies TRILL active/active edge which allows
       multiple RBridges concurrently forward data frames of the same VLAN
       on links bundled by Link Aggregation. With this kind of connection,
       end nodes may increase the bandwidth and reliability of the access at
       the edge of TRILL campuses. It's required that no loop or duplication
       is caused by this new connection type. Besides this basic
       requirement, this document outlines other potential issues associated
       with TRILL active/active edge and investigates how these issues may
       be addressed.

  "mLDP Extensions for Multi Topology Routing", IJsbrand Wijnands, Kamran
  Raza, 20-Jun-13, <draft-iwijnand-mpls-mldp-multi-topology-03.txt>

    The Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) enables service differentiation
       through class-based forwarding. IGP protocols (OSPF and IS-IS) have
       already been extended to setup MTR. In order to deploy mLDP in an
       MTR network, mLDP is also required to become topology-aware. This
       document specifies extensions to mLDP to support Multi-Topology
       Routing.

  "Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP), Compressed Bundle Header
  Encoding (CBHE), and Bundle Protocol IANA Registries", Keith Scott, Marc
  Blanchet, 10-May-13, <draft-dtnrg-ltp-cbhe-registries-05.txt>

    The DTNRG research group has defined the experimental Licklider
       Transmission Protocol (LTP) [RFC5326] and the Compressed Bundle
       Header Encoding (CBHE) [RFC6260] mechanism for the 'ipn' URI scheme.
       Finally, RFC5050 [RFC5050] defines values for the Bundle
       Administrative Record Type.  All of these describe fields that are
       subject to a registry.  For the purpose of its research work, the
       group has created ad-hoc registries.  As the specifications are
       stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the group
       would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official custody.
       This document describes the actions needed to be executed by IANA.

  "A General Framework of Source Address Validation and Traceback for
  IPv4/IPv6 Transition Scenarios", Hui Deng, Guangwu Hu, Jun Bi, Mingwei
  Xu, Fan Shi, 7-May-13, <draft-xu-savi-transition-03.txt>

    IP spoofing always is bothering us along with the Internet invention.
       With the rapid development of IPv6 next generation Internet, this
       issue is more prominent. Though many studies have made their
       contributions to the prevention of IP-spoofing, the most excellent
       one is the SAVI (Source Address Validation Improvement) proposal
       advocated by IETF, since it can prevent IP-spoofing from happening by
       automatically binding the key properties of hosts in layer2 access
       subnet. Nevertheless, till now, SAVI only focuses on the IPv6 stack
       and simple network access scenarios. To the best of our knowledge,
       there is no solution even has paid attention to IPv4/IPv6 transition
       scenarios. Given the fact that IPv4/IPv6 transition will continue to
       be adopted for a long period of time, this issue is becoming
       increasingly urgent. However, since transition schemes are plenty and
       diverse, hardly can an ordinary solution satisfy all the requirements
       of various transition scenarios. In this document, we present an
       improved general SAVI-based framework of IP source address validation
       and traceback for IPv4/IPv6 transition scenarios. To achieve this
       goal, we extract essential and mutual properties from these
       transition schemes, and create sub-solutions for each property.
       Naturally, if one transition scheme is proposed by combining some
       properties, the corresponding sub-solutions would be included into
       its IP source address validation and traceback solution. Therefore,
       the advantage of this framework is its capability to adapt to all the
       transition schemes.

  "SAVI Requirements and Solutions for ISP IPv6 Access Network", Fan Shi,
  Hui Deng, Liang Zhu, Guangwu Hu, 7-May-13,
  <draft-shi-savi-access-03.txt>

    Internet is always confronted with many security threats based on IP
       address spoofing which can enable impersonation and malicious traffic
       redirection. Unfortunately, the Internet architecture fails to
       provide the defense mechanism. Source Address Validation Improvement
       (SAVI) was developed to prevent IP source address spoofing.
       Especially, the mechanism is essential for ISPs. However, due to the
       diversity of address assignment methods, SAVI solution is also
       different accordingly. This document describes five scenarios of
       ISPs'IPv6 access network, and moreover, states its SAVI requirements
       and tentative solutions accordingly.

  "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) on Link Aggregation Group
  (LAG) Interfaces", Manav Bhatia, Mach Chen, Sami Boutros, Marc
  Binderberger, Jeffrey Haas, 12-Apr-13, <draft-mmm-bfd-on-lags-07.txt>

    This document proposes a mechanism to run BFD on Link Aggregation
       Group (LAG) interfaces.  It does so by running an independent
       Asynchronous mode BFD session on every LAG member link.
    
       This mechanism allows the verification of member link continuity,
       either in combination with, or in absence of, LACP.  It provides a
       shorter detection time than what LACP offers.  The continuity check
       can also cover elements of layer 3 bidirectional forwarding.
    
       This mechanism utilizes a well-known UDP port distinct from that of
       single-hop BFD over IP.  This new UDP port removes the ambiguity of
       BFD over LAG packets from BFD over single-hop IP.

  "Security Implications of IPv6 Options of Type 10xxxxxx", Fernando Gont,
  Will Liu, 20-Mar-13, <draft-gont-6man-ipv6-smurf-amplifier-03.txt>

    When an IPv6 node processing an IPv6 packet does not support an IPv6
       option whose two-highest-order bits of the Option Type are '10', it
       is required to respond with an ICMPv6 Parameter Problem error
       message, even if the Destination Address of the packet was a
       multicast address.  This feature provides an amplification vector,
       opening the door to an IPv6 version of the 'Smurf' Denial-of-Service
       (DoS) attack found in IPv4 networks.  This document discusses the
       security implications of the aforementioned options, and formally
       updates RFC 2460 and RFC 4443 such that this attack vector is
       eliminated.  Additionally, it describes a number of operational
       mitigations that could be deployed against this attack vector.

  "More Accurate ECN Feedback in TCP", Mirja Kuehlewind, Richard
  Scheffenegger, 20-Jun-13, <draft-kuehlewind-tcpm-accurate-ecn-02.txt>

    Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an IP/TCP mechanism where
       network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to
       indicate congestion to the end-points.  ECN-capable receivers will
       feedback this information to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP in
       such a way that only one feedback signal can be transmitted per
       Round-Trip Time (RTT).  Recently, new TCP mechanisms like ConEx or
       DCTCP need more accurate ECN feedback information in the case where
       more than one marking is received in one RTT.  This document
       specifies a different scheme for the ECN feedback in the TCP header
       to provide more than one feedback signal per RTT.  Furthermore this
       document specifies a re-use of the Urgent Pointer in the TCP header
       if the URG flag is not set to increase the robustness of the proposed
       ECN feedback scheme.

  "Internationalized Domain Name Mapping Extension for the Extensible
  Provisioning Protocol (EPP)", Francisco Obispo, Luis Munoz, 6-May-13,
  <draft-obispo-epp-idn-03.txt>

    This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
       extension mapping for the provisioning of Internationalized Domain
       Names (IDN) stored in a shared central repository.  This mapping
       extends the EPP domain name mapping to provide additional features
       required to implement registrations of domain names in characters
       sets other than ASCII.

  "Mobility and Interconnection of Virtual Machines and Virtual Network
  Elements", Bhumip Khasnabish, Bin Liu, Baohua Lei, Feng Wang, 30-Dec-12,
  <draft-khasnabish-vmmi-problems-03.txt>

    In this draft, we discuss the challenges and requirements related to
       the migration, mobility, and interconnection of Virtual Machines
       (VMs)and Virtual Network Elements (VNEs).  VM migration scheme across
       IP subnets is needed to implement virtual computing resources sharing
       across multiple network administrative domains.  Many technologies
       are involved in the VM migration across DCs.  These technologies are
       classified and discussed according to their different locations in
       the inter-DC and intra-DC network.  For the seamless online migration
       in various scenarios, many problems need to be resolved in the
       control plane.  The VM migration process should be adapted to these
       aspects.  We also describe the limitations of various types of
       virtual local area(VLAN) networking technologies and virtual private
       networking (VPN) technologies that are traditionally expected to
       support such migration, mobility, and interconnections.

  <draft-liu-pwe3-mpls-tp-p2mp-pw-protection-03.txt>

    The requirements of MPLS-TP in RFC 5654 include a requirement(R63)
       that requires MPLS-TP MUST be possible to provide protection for
       MPLS-TP data plane without any IP forwarding capability and control
       plane.If applying 1:1 protection mechanism for the p2mp traffic in
       rfc6718 , it must have a return path to coordinate switch state to
       select the same path to receive and send traffic packet.For the above
       problem,this document describes a kind of protection solution to
       recovery and protect the p2mp traffic under the failure condition.
    
    This document is a product of a joint Internet Task Force(IETF) /
       International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
       Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
       Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the

  "CoRE Interfaces", Zach Shelby, Matthieu Vial, 16-Mar-13,
  <draft-shelby-core-interfaces-05.txt>

    This document defines well-known REST interface descriptions for
       Batch, Sensor, Parameter and Actuator types for use in contrained web
       servers using the CoRE Link Format.  A short reference is provided
       for each type that can be efficiently included in the interface
       description attribute of the CoRE Link Format.  These descriptions
       are intended to be for general use in resource designs or for
       inclusion in more specific interface profiles.  In addition, this
       document defines the concepts of Function Set and Binding.  The
       former is the basis element to create RESTful profiles and the latter
       helps the configuration of links between resources located on one or
       more endpoints.

  "Multicast Geo-Distribution Control", Huajin Jeng, Jeffrey Haas, Yakov
  Rekhter, Jeffrey Zhang, 31-Dec-12,
  <draft-rekhter-geo-distribution-control-02.txt>

    Consider a content provider that wants to deliver a particular
       content to a set of customers/subscribers, where the provider and the
       subscribers are connected by an IP service provider. This document
       covers two areas needed to accomplish this: (1) providing the content
       provider with the information of whether it can use the multicast
       connectivity service provided by the IP service provider to deliver a
       particular content to a particular set of subscribers, and (2)
       providing the content provider with a mechanism to restrict delivery
       of a given content to a particular set of the subscribers.

  "Plasma Service Trust Processing", Jim Schaad, 11-Jan-13,
  <draft-schaad-plasma-service-04.txt>

    RFC TBD describes a new model and set of requirements to implement a
       labeling system on Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) objects where
       the entity in charge of doing the label enforcement is under the
       control of a central authority rather than the recipient of the
       object.
    
       This document describes a protocol to be used by senders and
       recipients of CMS objects to communicate with a centralized label
       enforcement server.  The document outlines how a client will get the
       set of labels or policies that it can use for sending messages,
       composes a secure CMS object with a label on it and gets the
       necessary keys to decrypt a CMS object from the server.  This
       document is designed to be used with RFC TBD2 which describes the
       extensions used in CMS objects to hold the label information.

  "Auto-Configuration of Designated VLANs", Mingui Zhang, Liangliang Ma,
  Xudong Zhang, 8-Jan-13, <draft-zhang-trill-dvlan-auto-02.txt>

    When RBridges are connected by a bridge LAN link, they need to select
       out a Designated VLAN to be used for PDU exchange and TRILL data
       forwarding.
    
       This document specifies an approach for RBridges to automatically
       determine a Designated VLAN on a LAN link for default configured
       RBridges. When a DVLAN has to be changed for the sake of a better
       connectivity of a LAN link, RBridges can change their Designated VLAN
       with least traffic interruption according to the soft Designated VLAN
       change method.

       deployed congestion control algorithms for RTP-based media flows.

  "Overlay Path Option for IP and TCP", Brandon Williams, 19-Jun-13,
  <draft-williams-overlaypath-ip-tcp-rfc-04.txt>

    Data transport through overlay networks often uses either connection
       termination or network address translation (NAT) in such a way that
       the public IP addresses of the true endpoint machines involved in the
       data transport are invisible to each other.  This document describes
       IPv4, IPv6, and TCP options for communicating this information from
       the overlay network to the endpoint machines.

  "Problem Statement of SAVI Beyond the First Hop", Jun Bi, Bingyang Liu,
  27-May-13, <draft-bi-savi-problem-05.txt>

    IETF Source Address Validation Improvements (SAVI) working group is
       chartered for source address validation within the first hop from the
       end hosts, i.e. preventing a node from spoofing the IP source address
       of another node in the same IP link.  However, since SAVI requires
       the edge routers or switches to be upgraded, the deployment of SAVI
       will need a long time.  During this transition period, some source
       address validation techniques beyond the first hop (SAVI-BF) may be
       needed to complement SAVI and protect the networks from spoofing
       based attacks.  In this document, we first propose three desired
       features of the SAVI-BF techniques.  Then we analyze the problems of
       the current SAVI-BF technique, ingress filtering.  Finally, we
       discuss the directions that we can explore to improve SAVI-BF.

  "Observations of RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy
  Networks", Thomas Clausen, Axel Verdiere, Jiazi Yi, Ulrich Herberg,
  Yuichi Igarashi, 25-Feb-13, <draft-clausen-lln-rpl-experiences-06.txt>

    With RPL - the "IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-power Lossy Networks" -
       having been published as a Proposed Standard after a ~2-year
       development cycle, this document presents an evaluation of the
       resulting protocol, of its applicability, and of its limits.  The
       documents presents a selection of observations of the protocol
       characteristics, exposes experiences acquired when producing various
       prototype implementations of RPL, and presents results obtained from
       testing this protocol - by way of network simulations, in network
       testbeds and in deployments.  The document aims at providing a better
       understanding of possible limits of RPL, notably the possible
       directions that further protocol developments should explore, in
       order to address these.

  "Network Virtualization Overlay Control Protocol Requirements", Lawrence
  Kreeger, Dinesh Dutt, Thomas Narten, David Black, Murari Sridharan,
  13-Jun-13, <draft-kreeger-nvo3-overlay-cp-04.txt>

    The document "Problem Statement: Overlays for Network Virtualization"
       discusses the needs for network virtualization using overlay networks
       in highly virtualized data centers.  The problem statement outlines a
       need for control protocols to facilitate running these overlay
       networks.  This document outlines the high level requirements to be
       fulfilled by the control protocols related to building and managing
       the mapping tables and other state information used by the Network
       Virtualization Edge to transmit encapsulated packets across the
       underlying network.

  "Carrying PIM-SM in ASM mode Trees over P2MP mLDP LSPs", Yakov Rekhter,
  Rahul Aggarwal, 22-Jan-13, <draft-rekhter-mpls-pim-sm-over-mldp-02.txt>

    When IP multicast trees created by PIM-SM in ASM mode need to pass
       through an MPLS domain, it may be desirable to map such trees to
       Point-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths. This document describes how
       to accomplish this in the case where such Point-to-Multipoint Label
       Switches Paths are established using mLDP.

  "Content De-duplication for CDNi Optimization", WeiYi Jin, Mian Li,
  Bhumip Khasnabish, 28-Mar-13,
  <draft-jin-cdni-content-deduplication-optimization-04.txt>

    Recent explosive growth of content delivery/distribution networks
       (CDNs) and their interconnection are causing unintended repetition of
       content storage in the same dCDN.  This can be avoided by using a
       suitable de-duplication mechanism.  This document explores the
       scenarios which create the problem, and then discusses the approaches
       to eliminate the duplicated transmission of the same content from
       uCDN(s) to dCDN in CDNi networks.  To implement the optimization,
       some enhancement to the CDNi metadata model and interface is
       required.
    
       We realize that for business-specific purposes the same content may
       be encrypted/packaged with different keys for different providers.
       The impact of DRM (Digital Rights Management) technology on de-
       duplication will be discussed in a future version of this draft.

  "Constructing protection paths for inter-AS, inter-sub-AS P2MP TE-LSPs",
  Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, 25-Jan-13,
  <draft-mjsraman-pce-inter-as-p2mp-protect-03.txt>

    Constructing primary and backup explicit path Point-to-Multipoint
       Label Switched Paths is important from the point of view of providing
       protection switching in case the primary fails.
    
       It is absolutely essential that the backup P2MP LSPs constructed do
       not share risk with any of the links and nodes of the primary path.
       In the case of inter-AS P2MP TE-LSPs or in the case of inter-sub-AS
       (in the case of BGP-Confederations being deployed) P2MP TE-LSPs where
       BGP confederations are deployed within an AS, such protection
       switching can be provided by calculating primary and backup multicast
       distribution trees (read P2MP TE-LSPs) that dont intersect with each
       other.
    
       In this paper we propose a method by which inter-sub-AS P2MP TE-LSPs
       (hence even inter-AS P2MP TE-LSPs) can be constructed by first
       finding the AS level topology of the network (be it inter-AS or
       inter-sub-AS within a single AS) in question and secondly to compute
       the paths in such a way that they dont intersect or if necessary in
       the worst case partially intersect each other. The proposed scheme is
       explained with an example and subsequent discussion is done to
       elucidate its benefits to multicast in particular.

  "Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) Uniform Resource Identifiers",
  Marc Petit-Huguenin, Suhas Nandakumar, Gonzalo Salgueiro, Paul Jones,
  6-May-13, <draft-petithuguenin-behave-turn-uris-04.txt>

    This document specifies the syntax of Uniform Resource Identifier
       (URI) schemes for the Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN)
       protocol.  It defines two URI schemes that can be used to provision
       the configuration values needed by the resolution mechanism defined
       in [RFC5928].

  "Distributed Mobility Anchoring", Pierrick Seite, Philippe Bertin,
  Jong-Hyouk Lee, 9-Jan-13, <draft-seite-dmm-dma-06.txt>

    Most existing IP mobility solutions are derived from Mobile IP
       principles where a given mobility anchor maintains Mobile Nodes (MNs)
       binding up-to-date.  Data traffic is then encapsulated between the
       mobility anchor and the MN or its Access Router.  These approaches
       are usually implemented on a centralised architectures where both MN
       context and traffic encapsulation need to be processed at a central
       network entity, i.e. the mobility anchor.  However, one of the trend
       in mobile network evolution is to "flatten" mobility architecture by
       confining mobility support in the access network, e.g. at the access
       routers level, keeping the rest of the network unaware of the
       mobility events and their support.  This document discusses the
       deployment of a Proxy Mobile IP approach in such a flat architecture.
       The solution allows to dynamically distribute mobility functions
       among access routers for an optimal routing management.  The goal is
       also to dynamically adapt the mobility support of the MN's needs by
       applying traffic redirection only to MNs' flows when an IP handover
       occurs.

  "Reducing Power Consumption using BGP", Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat,
  Gaurav Raina, 27-Apr-13, <draft-mjsraman-rtgwg-inter-as-psp-06.txt>

    In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
       consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between
       Autonomous Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS
       and then use Traffic Engineering (TE) techniques to route the packets
       along the paths. Such low-power paths can be identified by using the
       consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth (PWR) ratio as an additional
       constraint in the Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm.
       For re-routing the data traffic through these low-power paths, the
       Inter-AS Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans
       multiple AS can be used. Extensions to the Border Gateway Protocol
       (BGP) can be used to disseminate the PWR ratio metric among the AS
       thereby creating a collaborative approach to reduce the power
       consumption. Since calculating the low-power paths can be
       computationally intensive, a graph-labeling heuristic is also
       proposed. This heuristic reduces the computational complexity but may
       provide a sub-optimal low-power path. The feasibility of our
       approaches is illustrated by applying our algorithm to a subset of
       the Internet. The techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-AS
       power reduction require minimal modifications to the existing
       features of the Internet. The proposed techniques can be extended to
       other levels of Internet hierarchy, such as Intra-AS paths, through
       suitable modifications.

  "Mapping RTP streams to CLUE media captures", Roni Even, Jonathan

  "Cross Stratum Optimization enabled Path Computation", Dhruv Dhody,
  Young Lee, Nicola Ciulli, Luis Contreras, Oscar de Dios, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-dhody-pce-cso-enabled-path-computation-03.txt>

    Applications like cloud computing, video gaming, HD Video streaming,
       Live Concerts, Remote Medical Surgery, etc are offered by Data
       Centers.  These data centers are geographically distributed and
       connected via a network.  Many decisions are made in the Application
       space without any concern of the underlying network.  Cross stratum
       application/network optimization focus on the challenges and
       opportunities presented by data center based applications and
       carriers networks together [CSO-DATACNTR].
    
       Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block for
       traffic engineering systems such as Multiprotocol Label Switching
       (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
       networks.  [RFC4655] explains the architecture for a Path Computation
       Element (PCE)-based model to address this problem space.
    
       This document explains the architecture for CSO enabled Path
       Computation.

  "Reverse DNS Naming Convention for CIDR Address Blocks", Joe Gersch, Dan
  Massey, Eric Osterweil, Cathie Olschanowsky, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-gersch-dnsop-revdns-cidr-04.txt>

    This draft proposes a naming convention for encoding CIDR address
       blocks into the reverse DNS namespace.  The reverse DNS naming method
       is commonly used to specify a complete IP address.  This document
       describes how to encode an IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR address block such as
       129.82.128.0/17.  By defining a common naming convention, one can
       associate information with a prefix.  The convention builds on past
       work in RFC 1101 that associates network names with prefixes.
       However, this previous work pre-dated the introduction of CIDR and
       has several critical ambiguities.  This convention corrects the
       ambiguities and enables new applications ranging from routing
       information to geolocation.

  "Request Routing Redirection Interface for CDN Interconnection", Wang
  Danhua, Ben Niven-Jenkins, Xiaoyan He, Ge Chen, Wei Ni, 31-Mar-13,
  <draft-he-cdni-routing-request-redirection-05.txt>

    The Request Routing Interface comprises of (1) the asynchronous
       advertisement of footprint and capabilities by a downstream CDN that
       allows a upstream CDN to decide whether to redirect particular user
       requests to that downstream CDN; and (2) the synchronous operation of
       an upstream CDN requesting whether a downstream CDN is prepared to
       accept a user request and of a downstream CDN responding with how to
       actually redirect the user request.  This document describes an
       interface for the latter part, i.e.  the CDNI request routing/
       Redirection Interface.

  "Conditional observe in CoAP", Shitao Li, Jeroen Hoebeke, Floris Van den
  Abeele, Antonio Jara, 23-Jun-13,
  <draft-li-core-conditional-observe-04.txt>

    CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and
       networks.  Through the Observe option, clients can observe changes in
       the state of resources and obtain a current representation of the
       last resource state.  This document defines a new mechanism in CoAP
       Observe so that a CoAP client can conditionally observe a resource on
       a CoAP server, only being informed about state changes meeting a
       specific condition or set of conditions.  This offers possibilities
       to extend network intelligence, enhance scalability, and optimize the
       lifetime and performance in order to address the requirements from
       the Constrained Nodes and Networks.

  "Tunneling Compressed Multiplexed Traffic Flows (TCMTF)", Jose Saldana,
  Dan Wing, Julian Navajas, Muthu Perumal, Fernando Blanco, 9-Jan-13,
  <draft-saldana-tsvwg-tcmtf-04.txt,.pdf>

    This document describes a method to improve the bandwidth utilization
       of network paths that carry multiple streams in parallel sharing a
       common path.  The method combines standard protocols that provide
       compression, multiplexing, and tunneling over a network path for the
       purpose of reducing the bandwidth used when multiple streams are
       carried over that path.

  "SNMPD to use cache and shared database based on MIB Classification",

    cache database and shared database (SDB) mechanism to reduce high CPU
    usage while SNMP GET REQUEST, GETNEXT REQUEST, GETBULK REQUEST are
    continuously performed from network management system (NMS)/SNMP
    manager/SNMP MIB browser to managed device.

  "Default Nickname Based Approach for Multilevel TRILL", Tissa
  Senevirathne, Les Ginsberg, Sam Aldrin, Ayan Banerjee, 28-May-13,
  <draft-tissa-trill-multilevel-02.txt>

    Multilevel TRILL allows the interconnection of multiple TRILL
       networks to form a larger TRILL network without proportionally
       increasing the size of the IS-IS LSP DB. In this document, an
       approach based on default route concept is presented. Also,
       presented in the document is a novel method of constructing multi-
       destination trees using partial nickname space. Methods presented in
       this document are compatible with the RFC6325 specified data plane
       operations.

    This documents presents thoughts on the potential impact of
       supporting HTTP Adaptive Streaming technologies in CDN
       Interconnection (CDNI) scenarios.  The intent is to present the
       authors' analysis of the CDNI-HAS problem space and discuss different
       options put forward both by the authors (and by others during
       informal discussions) on how to deal with HAS in the context of CDNI.
       THis document has been used as input information during the WG
       process for making its decision regarding support for HAS.

  "A Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Usage for REsource LOcation
  And Discovery (RELOAD)", Jaime Jimenez, Jose Lopez-Vega, Jouni Maenpaa,
  Gonzalo Camarillo, 17-Feb-13, <draft-jimenez-p2psip-coap-reload-03.txt>

    This document defines a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Usage
       for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD).  The CoAP Usage
       provides the functionality to federate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
       in a peer-to-peer fashion.  The CoAP Usage also provides a rendezvous
       service for CoAP Nodes and caching of sensor information.  The RELOAD
       AppAttach method is used to establish a direct connection between
       nodes through which CoAP messages are exchanged.

  "Pro-active connectivity monitoring for TRILL", Rohit Watve, Tissa
  Senevirathne, Chandan Mishra, Gayatri Ramachandran, 4-Feb-13,
  <draft-rohit-trill-proactive-oam-02.txt>

    Pro-active fault monitoring for TRILL monitors all the paths between
       any two given RBridges in the network. Number of paths to be
       monitored can be of exponential order based on the distance between
       two RBridges. In this document novel fault monitoring mechanism
       based on a distributed approach is presented.

  "CoAP Option Extension: Patience", Kepeng Li, Bert Greevenbosch, Esko
  Dijk, Salvatore Loreto, 23-Apr-13,
  <draft-li-core-coap-patience-option-02.txt>

    CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and
       networks.  This specification provides a simple extension for CoAP,
       the Patience option.  This option informs a recipient of the
       preferred time frame for a request or response depending on usage
       context.  In a unicast request, it indicates the patience a client
       has in waiting for a response.  The CoAP server tries to return the
       response within the specified time frame.  In a multicast request, it
       indicates the patience a server should have in sending its response.
       The recipient would then try to randomly delay its response within
       the time frame that the requester indicated or computed by the
       recipient itself.  In a CoAP observe notification, it indicates the
       patience an observer should have in both waiting for a subsequent
       notification and in re-establishing an observation relation.

  "RTP Payload Format for High Efficiency Video Coding", Thomas Schierl,
  Stephan Wenger, Ye-Kui Wang, Miska Hannuksela, Yago Sanchez, 11-Jun-13,
  <draft-schierl-payload-rtp-h265-03.txt>

    This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding
       standard  ITU-T  Recommendation  H.265  and  ISO/IEC  International
       Standard 23008-2, both also known as High Efficiency Video Coding
       (HEVC) [HEVC], developed by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video
       Coding (JCT-VC).  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of
       one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet
       payload, as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP
       packets.  Furthermore, it supports transmission of an HEVC stream
       over a single as well as multiple RTP flows.  The payload format has
       wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming,
       and high bit-rate entertainment-quality video, among others.

  "DNS Resource Records for Authorized Routing Information", Joe Gersch,
  Dan Massey, Cathie Olschanowsky, Lixia Zhang, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-gersch-grow-revdns-bgp-02.txt>

    This draft discusses the use of two DNS record types for storing BGP
       routing information in the reverse DNS.  The RLOCK record allows
       prefix owners to indicate whether the DNS is being used to publish
       routing data.  The SRO record allows operators to indicate whether an
       IPv4 or IPv6 prefix ought to appear in global routing tables and
       identifies authorized origin Autonomous System Number(s) for that
       prefix.  The resulting published data can be used in a variety of
       contexts from routing security to address ownership.

  "OSPF extensions for support spectrum sub-band allocation", Qilei Wang,
  Xihua Fu, 26-Feb-13,
  <draft-wang-ccamp-flexigrid-wavelength-range-ospf-02.txt>

    This document addresses the requirements and routing protocol
       extension of spectrum sub-band allocation in order to help reduce
       non-linear effect and raise spectrum utilization rate in the scenario
       of indiscriminately positioning of various channels with different
       bit rates.

  "A Stateless Transport Tunneling Protocol for Network Virtualization
  (STT)", Bruce Davie, Jesse Gross, 12-Mar-13, <draft-davie-stt-03.txt>

    Network Virtualization places unique requirements on tunneling
       protocols.  This draft describes STT (Stateless Transport Tunneling),
       a tunnel encapsulation that enables overlay networks to be built in
       virtualized networks.  STT is particularly useful when some tunnel
       endpoints are in end-systems, as it utilizes the capabilities of the
       network interface card to improve performance.

  "End-to-End Object Encryption and Signatures for the Extensible
  Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)", Matthew Miller, 13-Jun-13,
  <draft-miller-xmpp-e2e-06.txt>

    This document defines two methods for securing objects (often
       referred to as stanzas) for the Extensible Messaging and Presence
       Protocol (XMPP), which allows for efficient asynchronous
       communication between two entities, each with might have multiple
       devices operating simultaneously.  One is a method to encrypt stanzas
       to provide confidentiality protection; another is a method to sign
       stanzas to provide authentication and integrity protection.  This
       document also defines a related protocol for entities to request the
       ephemeral session keys in use.

  "Constructing power optimal P2MP TE-LSPs within an AS", Shankar Raman,
  Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-mjsraman-pce-power-replic-02.txt>

    Power consumption in multicast replication operations is an area of
       concern and choosing suitable replication points that can decrease
       power consumption overall assumes importance. Multicast replication
       capacity is an attribute of every line card of major routers and
       multi-layer switches that support multicast in the core of an
       Internet Service Provider (ISP) or an enterprise network.
    
       Currently multicast replication points on Point-to-Multipoint Traffic
       Engineering Label-Switched-Paths (P2MP TE-LSPs) consume power while
       delivering multiple output streams of data from a given input stream.
       The multicast distribution trees are constructed without any regard
       for a proper placement of the replication points and consequent
       optimal power consumption at these points.
    
       This results in overloading certain routers while under-utilizing
       others. An optimal usage of these replication resources could
       substantially reduce power consumption on these routers. In this
       paper, we propose a mechanism by which P2MP TE-LSPs are constructed
       for carrying multicast traffic across multiple areas within a given
       AS. We propose that these LSPs be built by using the advertisements
       of the power-replication capacity ratio advertised by fine grained
       components such as multicast capable line-cards of routers and multi-
       layer switches deployed within an AS.

  "CDNI Control Interface / Triggers", Rob Murray, Ben Niven-Jenkins,
  3-Apr-13, <draft-murray-cdni-triggers-03.txt>

    This document describes the part of the CDN Interconnect Control
       Interface that allows a CDN to trigger activity in an interconnected
       CDN that is configured to deliver content on its behalf.  The
       upstream CDN can use this mechanism to request that the downstream
       CDN pre-positions metadata or content, or that it re-validate or
       purge metadata or content.  The upstream CDN can monitor the status
       of activity that it has triggered in the downstream CDN.

  "PCP Server Discovery with IPv4 traffic offload for Proxy Mobile IPv6",
  Tirumaleswar Reddy, Prashanth Patil, Ravikumar Chandrasekaran, Dan Wing,
  11-Feb-13, <draft-rpcw-pcp-pmipv6-serv-discovery-02.txt>

    This document proposes a solution to PCP Server Discovery problems in
       Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) networks when both home network traffic
       and traffic off-loaded to local access network require traversing a
       gateway implementing NAT and/or Firewall.  This draft proposes
       enhancements to DHCPv4 Relay Agent by introducing a new sub-option
       under DHCPv4 Relay Option and to PMIPv6 signaling through additional
       options to Proxy Binding Update/Acknowledgement messages.

  "Formal Specification Framework for Software-Defined Networks (SDN)",
  Myung-Ki Shin, Ki-Hyuk Nam, Miyoung Kang, Jin-Young Choi, 13-Feb-13,
  <draft-shin-sdn-formal-specification-03.txt>

    This document discusses formally verifiable networking framework for
       software-defined networks (SDN). In SDN, incomplete or malicious
       programmable entities could cause break-down of underlying networks
       shared by heterogeneous devices and stake-holders. Formally
       verifiable networking can provide a logic-based framework to unify
       the design, specification, verification, and implementation of SDN.
       This framework describes formal specification and verification
       process for SDN. In addition, we present two examples of formal
       specification for a part of SDN using a process algebra called
       Algebra of Communicating Shard Resources (ACSR) and Z specification
       languages.

    This document builds on [6][7] and defines GMPLS signaling
       extensions to carry super-channel optical parameters for efficient
       spectrum assignment on flexible grid networks.

  "PMIPv6-based Distributed Mobility Management", Jaehwoon Lee, 11-Jun-13,
  <draft-jaehwoon-dmm-pmipv6-01.txt>

    Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is the network-based mobility management
       protocol where access network supports the mobility of a mobile node
       on behalf of the MN. In PMIPv6, the location information of the MN
       should be registered to Localized Mobility Anchor and communication
       must be established via the LMA. Therefore, the performance can be
       degraded due to traffic concentration and congestion possibility.
       One method to overcome the above problems is to exploit the
       distributed mobility management (DMM) mechanism to distribute the
       LMA function to all access routers within the PMIPv6 domain. This
       letter proposes the fully distributed mobility management mechanism
       in PMIPv6-based network. In this mechanism, there is no need for
       the location management function to register the location of the MN.
       Therefore, the performance is not degraded due to the overhead to
       query the location of the MN.

       to allow added CSPF constraints for efficient super-channel spectrum
       assignment on flexible grid networks.

  "STUN Usage for Consent Freshness", Muthu Perumal, Dan Wing, Ram R,
  Hadriel Kaplan, 25-Feb-13, <draft-muthu-behave-consent-freshness-03.txt>

    Verification of peer consent before sending traffic is necessary in
       WebRTC deployments to ensure that a malicious JavaScript cannot use
       the browser as a platform for launching attacks.  A related problem
       is session liveness.  WebRTC applications may want to detect
       connection failure and take appropriate actions.  This document
       describes a STUN usage that enables a WebRTC browser to perform the
       following on a candidate pair ICE is using for a media component
       after session establishment:

  "Scaling the Address Resolution Protocol for Large Data Centers (SARP)",
  Youval Nachum, Linda Dunbar, Ilan Yerushalmi, Tal Mizrahi, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-nachum-sarp-04.txt>

    This  document  provides  a  recommended  architecture  and  network
       operation  named  SARP.  SARP  is  based  on  fast  proxies  that
       significantly  reduce  broadcast  domains  and  ARP/ND  broadcast
       transmissions. SARP supports smooth and fast virtual machine (VM)
       mobility without any modification to the VM, while keeping the
       connection up and running efficiently.  SARP is targeted for massive
       scaling data centers with a significant number of VMs using ARP and
       ND protocols.

  "Applicability of Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE)", Xian Zhang,
  Ina Minei, 25-May-13, <draft-zhang-pce-stateful-pce-app-04.txt>

    A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information about
       Label Switched Path (LSP) characteristics and resource usage within a
       network in order to provide traffic engineering calculations for its
       associated Path Computation Clients (PCCs).  This document describes
       general considerations for a stateful PCE deployment and examines its
       applicability and benefits through a number of use cases.  Path
       Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) extensions required for stateful
       PCE usage are covered in separate documents.

  "An Architecture for Multicast Protection Using Maximally Redundant
  Trees", Alia Atlas, Robert Kebler, IJsbrand Wijnands, Andras Csaszar,
  Gabor Envedi, 25-Feb-13, <draft-atlas-rtgwg-mrt-mc-arch-01.txt>

    Failure protection is desirable for multicast traffic, whether
       signaled via PIM or mLDP.  Different mechanisms are suitable for
       different use-cases and deployment scenarios.  This document
       describes the architecture for global protection (aka multicast live-
       live) and for local protection (aka fast-reroute).
    
       The general methods for global protection and local protection using
       alternate-trees are dependent upon the use of Maximally Redundant
       Trees.  Local protection can also tunnel traffic in unicast tunnels
       to take advantage of the routing and fast-reroute mechanisms
       available for IP/LDP unicast destinations.
    
       The failures protected against are single link or node failures.
       While the basic architecture might support protection against shared
       risk group failures, algorithms to dynamically compute MRTs
       supporting this are for future study.

  "PMIPv6-based distributed anchoring", Carlos Bernardos, Juan Zuniga,
  8-Apr-13, <draft-bernardos-dmm-distributed-anchoring-02.txt>

    Distributed Mobility Management solutions allow for setting up
       networks so that traffic is distributed in an optimal way and does
       not rely on centralized deployed anchors to provide IP mobility
       support.
    
       There are many different approaches to address Distributed Mobility
       Management, as for example extending network-based mobility protocols
       (like Proxy Mobile IPv6), or client-based mobility protocols (as
       Mobile IPv6), among others.  This document follows the former
       approach, and proposes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 in which
       mobility sessions are anchored at the last IP hop router (called
       distributed gateway).  The distributed gateway is an enhanced access
       router which is also able to operate as local mobility anchor or
       mobility access gateway, on a per prefix basis.  The draft focuses on
       the required extensions to effectively support simultaneously
       anchoring several flows at different distributed gateways.
    
       This draft introduces the concept of distributed logical interface
       (at the distributed gateway), which is a software construct that
       allows to easily hide the change of anchor from the mobile node.
       Additionally, the draft describes how to provide session continuity
       in inter-domain scenarios in which dynamic tunneling or signaling
       between distributed gateways from different operators is not allowed.

  "The Applicability of the PCE to Computing Protection and Recovery Paths
  for Single Domain and Multi-Domain Networks.", Huaimo Chen, Dhruv Dhody,
  29-Apr-13, <draft-chen-pce-protection-applicability-03.txt>

    The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation
       functions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label
       Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.
    
       A link or node failure can significantly impact network services in
       large-scale networks.  Therefore it is important to ensure the
       survivability of large scale networks which consist of various
       connections provided over multiple interconnected networks with
       varying technologies.
    
       This document examines the applicability of the PCE architecture,
       protocols, and procedures for computing protection paths and
       restoration services, for single and multi-domain networks.
    
       This document also explains the mechanism of Fast Re-Route (FRR)
       where a point of local repair (PLR) needs to find the appropriate
       merge point (MP) to do bypass path computation using PCE.

  "Analysis of Port Control P0rotocol in Mobile Network", Gang Chen, Zhen
  Cao, Mohamed Boucadair, Vizdal Ales, Laurent Thiebaut, 25-Apr-13,
  <draft-chen-pcp-mobile-deployment-03.txt>

    This memo provides a motivation description for the Port Control
       Protocol (PCP) deployment in a 3GPP mobile network environment.  The
       document focuses on a mobile network specific issues (e.g.  cell
       phone battery power consumption, keep-alive traffic reduction), PCP
       applicability to these issues is further studied and analyzed.

  "NAT traversal for LISP", Vina Ermagan, Dino Farinacci, Darrel Lewis,
  Jesper Skriver, Fabio Maino, Chris White, 29-Mar-13,
  <draft-ermagan-lisp-nat-traversal-03.txt>

    This document describes a mechanism for IPv4 NAT traversal for LISP
       tunnel routers (xTR) and LISP Mobile Nodes (LISP-MN) behind a NAT
       device.  A LISP device both detects the NAT and initializes its
       state.  Forwarding to the LISP device through a NAT is enabled by a
       new network element, the LISP Re-encapsulating Tunnel Router (RTR),
       which acts as an anchor point in the data plane, forwarding traffic
       from unmodified LISP devices through the NAT.

  "Requirements for Message Access Control", Trevor Freeman, Jim Schaad,
  Patrick Patterson, 12-Jun-13, <draft-freeman-plasma-requirements-06.txt>

    There are many situations where organizations want to protect
       information with robust access control, either for implementation of
       intellectual property right protections, enforcement of contractual
       confidentiality agreements or because of legal regulations.  The
       Enhanced Security Services (ESS) for S/MIME defines an access control
       mechanism for email which is enforced by the recipient's client after
       decryption of the message. The ESS mechanism therefore is dependent
       on the correct access policy configuration of every recipient's
       client. This mechanism also provides full access to the data to all
       recipients prior to the access control check, this is considered to
       be inadequate due to the difficulty in demonstrating policy
       compliance.
    
       This document lays out the deficiencies of the current ESS security
       label, and presents requirements for a new model for providing access
       control to messages where the access check is performed prior to
       message content decryption. This new model also does not require
       policy configuration on the client to simplify deployment and
       compliance verification.
    
       The proposed model additionally provides a method where non-X.509
       certificate credentials can be used for encryption/decryption of
       S/MIME messages.

  "Service Provider Wi-Fi Services Over Residential Architectures", Sri
  Gundavelli, Mark Grayson, Pierrick Seite, Yiu Lee, 23-Apr-13,
  <draft-gundavelli-v6ops-community-wifi-svcs-06.txt>

    The tremendous growth in Wi-Fi technology adoption over the last
       decade has met the ultimate possible goal of 100% adoption rate.  All
       most every new mobile device is now equipped with IEEE 802.11-based
       wireless interface and with pre-configured policy to prefer Wi-Fi to
       cellular access.  Matching this evolution is every service provider's
       desire to offer Wi-Fi based broadband services; a new business
       opportunity even for fixed line operators.  Operators are exploring
       options to monetize their existing networks, most with nation-wide
       footprint, to build a high-speed Wi-Fi service that can be the basis
       for offering new wireless broadband services.  This document
       identifies the requirements for supporting these new Wi-Fi community
       services and the mobility tools which have been standardized in IETF
       that can be used for enabling these architectures.

  "CUSAX: Combined Use of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
  Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)", Emil Ivov, Peter
  Saint-Andre, Enrico Marocco, 5-Jun-13, <draft-ivov-xmpp-cusax-06.txt>

    This document describes suggested practices for combined use of the
       Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and
       Presence Protocol (XMPP).  Such practices aim to provide a single
       fully featured real-time communication service by using complementary
       subsets of features from each of the protocols.  Typically such
       subsets would include telephony capabilities from SIP and instant
       messaging and presence capabilities from XMPP.  This specification
       does not define any new protocols or syntax for either SIP or XMPP.
       However, implementing the practices outlined in this document may
       require modifying or at least reconfiguring existing client and
       server-side software.  Also, it is not the purpose of this document
       to make recommendations as to whether or not such combined use should
       be preferred to the mechanisms provided natively by each protocol
       (for example, SIP's SIMPLE or XMPP's Jingle).  It merely aims to
       provide guidance to those who are interested in such a combined use.

  "WebRTC Data Channel Protocol", Randell Jesup, Salvatore Loreto, Michael
  Tuexen, 26-Feb-13, <draft-jesup-rtcweb-data-protocol-04.txt>

    The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) working group is charged to
    provide protocols to support for direct interactive rich
    communication using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-
    browsers.  This document specifies an actual (minor) protocol for how
    the JS-layer DataChannel objects provide the data channels between
    the peers.

  "IPv6 Operational Guidelines for Datacenters", Diego Lopez, Zhonghua
  Chen, Tina Tsou, Cathy Zhou, Arturo Servin, 5-Feb-13,
  <draft-lopez-v6ops-dc-ipv6-04.txt>

    This document is intended to provide operational guidelines for
       datacenter operators planning to deploy IPv6 in their
       infrastructures.  It aims to offer a reference framework for
       evaluating different products and architectures, and therefore it is
       also addressed to manufacturers and solution providers, so they can
       use it to gauge their solutions.  We believe this will translate in a
       smoother and faster IPv6 transition for datacenters of these
       infrastuctures.
    
       The document focuses on the DC infrastructure itself, its operation,
       and the aspects related to DC interconnection through IPv6.  It does
       not consider the particular mechanisms for making Internet services
       provided by applications hosted in the DC available through IPv6
       beyond the specific aspects related to how their deployment on the DC
       infrastructure.
    
       Apart from facilitating the transition to IPv6, the mechanisms
       outlined here are intended to make this transition as transparent as
       possible (if not completely transparent) to applications and services
       running on the DC infrastructure, as well as to take advantage of
       IPv6 features to simplify DC operations, internally and across the
       Internet.

  "Building power shortest inter-Area TE LSPs using pre-computed paths",
  Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, 4-May-13,
  <draft-mjsraman-rtgwg-intra-as-psp-te-leak-03.txt>

    In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
       consumption of an Autonomous System (AS) using a collaborative
       approach between areas within an AS. We identify the low-power paths
       within non-backbone areas and then use Traffic Engineering (TE)
       techniques to route the packets along the stitched paths from non-
       backbone areas / backbone area to other non-backbone areas. Such low-
       power paths can be identified by using the power-to-available-
       bandwidth (PWR) ratio as an additional constraint in the Constrained
       Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm. For routing the data traffic
       through these low-power paths, the Inter-Area Traffic Engineered
       Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans multiple areas can be used.
       Extensions to the Interior Gateway Protocols like OSPF and IS-IS that
       support TE extensions can be used to disseminate information about
       low-power paths in the respective areas (backbone or non-backbone)
       that minimize the PWR ratio metric on the links within the areas and
       between the areas thereby creating a collaborative approach to reduce
       the power consumption.
    
       The feasibility of our approaches is illustrated by applying our
       algorithm to an AS with a backbone area and several non-backbone
       areas. The techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-Area power
       reduced paths require a few modifications to the existing features of
       the IGPs supporting TE extensions. The proposed techniques can be
       extended to other levels of Internet hierarchy, such as Inter-AS
       paths, through suitable modifications as in [11].
    
       When link state routing protocols like OSPF or ISIS are used to
       discover TE topology, there is the limitation that traffic engineered
       paths can be set up only when the head and tail end of the label
       switched path are in the same area. There are solutions to overcome
       this limitation either using offline Path Computation Engine (PCE)
       that attach to multiple areas and know the topology of all areas.
       This document proposes an alternative approach that does not require
       any centralized PCE and uses selective leaking of low-power TE path
       information from one area into other areas.

  "A Framework and Information Model for Queries about Telephone-Related
  Queries (TeRQ)", Jon Peterson, 25-Feb-13, <draft-peterson-terq-03.txt>

    As telephone services migrate to the Internet, Internet applications
       require access to diverse information about telephone numbers.  ENUM,
       for example, applied the DNS to the problem of finding URIs for
       telephone services on the Internet.  The intrinsic limitations in the
       query/response semantics of the DNS, however, have often been
       strained by the requirements for accessing information about
       telephone numbers.  This document therefore proposes a protocol-
       independent framework and information model for querying and
       responding to requests concerning telephone numbers and call routing
       that allows a richer expression of both questions and answers.

  "New Differentiated Services Code Point Assignments for Rich Media
  Traffic", James Polk, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-polk-tsvwg-new-dscp-assignments-02.txt>

    This document requests five new Differentiated Services Code Point
       (DSCP) values (DSCP) from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
       (IANA) for new classes of rich media traffic and one additional DSCP
       value for the signaling of multimedia sessions.

  "Standard Configuration of DiffServ Service Classes", James Polk,
  5-Mar-13, <draft-polk-tsvwg-rfc4594-update-03.txt>

    This document describes service classes configured with DiffServ and
    identifies how they are used and how to construct them using
    Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), traffic conditioners,
    Per-Hop Behaviors (PHBs), and Active Queue Management (AQM)
    mechanisms.  There is no intrinsic requirement that particular
    DSCPs, traffic conditioners, PHBs, and AQM be used for a certain
    service class, but for consistent behavior under the same network
    conditions, configuring networks as described here is appropriate.

  "RSVP Setup Protection", Yimin Shen, Yuji Kamite, 8-Feb-13,
  <draft-shen-mpls-rsvp-setup-protection-02.txt>

    RFC 4090 specifies an RSVP facility-backup fast reroute mechanism for
       protecting established LSPs against link and node failures.  This
       document extends the mechanism to provide so-called "setup
       protection" for LSPs during their initial Path message signaling
       time.  In particular, it enables a router to reroute an LSP via an
       existing bypass LSP, when there is a failure of the immediate
       downstream link or node along the desired path.  Therefore, it can be
       used to reduce LSP setup time in such a situation, or allow LSPs with
       strict paths to be established successfully when alternative paths
       are unavailable in the network or unable to be computed by ingress.

  "CDNI Request Routing: Footprint and Capabilities Semantics", Jan
  Seedorf, Jon Peterson, Stefano Previdi, Ray van Brandenburg, Kevin Ma,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-spp-cdni-rr-foot-cap-semantics-04.txt>

    This document tries to capture the semantics of the "Footprint and
       Capabilities Advertisement" part of the CDNI Request Routing
       interface, i.e. the desired meaning and what "Footprint and
       Capabilities Advertisement" is expected to offer within CDNI.  The
       discussion in this document has the goal to facilitate the choosing
       of one or more suitable protocols for "Footprint and Capabilities
       Advertisement" within CDNI Request Routing.

  "Accessing Cloud Services", Yaakov Stein, Yuri Gittik, Daniel Kofman,
  Konstantinos Katsaros, Monique Morrow, Luyuan Fang, Wim Henderickx,
  8-Jan-13, <draft-stein-cloud-access-02.txt>

    Cloud services are revolutionizing the way computational resources
       are provided, but at the expense of requiring an even more
       revolutionary overhaul of the networking infrastructure needed to
       deliver them.  Much recent work has focused on intra- and inter-
       datacenter connectivity requirements and architectures, while the
       "access segment" connecting the cloud services user to the datacenter
       still needs to be addressed.  In this draft we consider tighter
       integration between the network and the datacenter, in order to
       improve end-to-end Quality of Experience, while minimizing both
       networking and computational resource costs.

  "ALTO session for CDN Interconnection", Stephan Emile, Selim Ellouze,
  16-Apr-13, <draft-stephan-cdni-alto-session-ext-03.txt>

    The selection of a downstream CDN by an upstream CDN is based on
       multi-dimensional criteria.  Various protocols, such as BGP or ALTO,
       may be used by a downstream CDN to expose content routing information
       and interconnection preferences to an upstream CDN.  The selection of
       such a protocol is premature as the WG, and especially the Footprint/
       Capabilities Design Team, is currently working on this topic.  So
       this draft does not promote the usage of the ALTO protocol for CDN
       interconnection.  It presents the limitations of the current ALTO
       protocol in the case it would be selected for CDN interconnection.
       It specifies the mechanism for controlling the session initialization
       and for limiting the information exchanged.  Then it discusses the
       need of incremental update and proposes to study the usage of Netconf
       /Yang to provide ALTO server with notifications.

  "Deployment Considerations for Lightweight 4over6", Qiong Sun, Chongfeng
  Xie, Yiu Lee, Maoke Chen, 14-Jan-13,
  <draft-sun-softwire-lightweigh-4over6-deployment-03.txt>

    Lightweight 4over6 is a mechanism which moves the translation
       function from tunnel Concentrator (AFTR) to Initiators (B4s), and
       hence reduces the mapping scale on the Concentrator to per-customer
       level.  This document discusses various deployment models of
       Lightweight 4over6.  It also describes the deployment considerations
       and applicability of the Lightweight 4over6 architecture.

  "DS-Lite Failure Detection and Failover", Tina Tsou, Brandon Li, Cathy
  Zhou, Juergen Schoenwaelder, Reinaldo Penno, Mohamed Boucadair,
  16-Jun-13, <draft-tsou-softwire-bfd-ds-lite-05.txt>

    In DS-Lite, the tunnel is stateless, not associated with any state
       information, and the CGN function at the AFTR is stateful.
       Currently, there is no failure detection and failover mechanism for
       both stateless tunnel and stateful CGN function, which makes it
       difficult to manage and diagnose if there is a problem.  This draft
       analyzes the applicability of some of the possible solutions.

  "Context Transfer for Multicast support in Distributed Mobility
  Management (DMM)", DH, Hitoshi Asaeda, Pierrick Seite, 19-Mar-13,
  <draft-vonhugo-multimob-dmm-context-02.txt>

    This document describes a context transfer based concept to support
       overarching IP multicast services applicable to various existing
       approaches for Distributed Mobility Management.

  "VLAN based Tree Selection for Multi-destination Frames", Li Yizhou, Hao
  Weiguo, Radia Perlman, Naveen Nimmu, Somnath Chatterjee, Sunny
  Rajagopalan, 14-Jan-13, <draft-yizhou-trill-tree-selection-02.txt>

    TRILL uses the distribution trees to deliver multi-destination frames.
       Multiple trees can be used by an ingress RBridge for different flow
       based on VLAN and/or multicast group. Different ingress RBridges may
       choose different distribution trees for the same VLAN and/or
       multicast group traffic. Distribution trees are normally pruned based
       on VLAN.
    
       For any RBridge RBn, if RBn has downstream receivers of VLAN x in a
       distribution tree t, there will be an entry of (t, x, port list) in
       the multicast forwarding table on RBn. If there are n trees and m
       VLANs, the multicast forwarding table size on RBn is typically n*m
       entries. The value of m is up to 4096 and n is the total number of
       distribution trees in the campus. If fine grained labeling is
       implemented or finer granularity filtering such as VLAN plus L2/L3
       multicast address is used for pruning, the multicast forwarding table
       size further increases dramatically. TRILL multicast forwarding table
       size is limited by hardware and L3 multicasting may share the same
       table with it in hardware implementations. Therefore multicast table
       entry is a precious resource. This document specifies a VLAN based
       tree selection mechanism to reduce the TRILL multicast forwarding
       table size on RBridge.

  "Multicast transition path optimization in IPv4 and IPv6 networks",
  Qiong Sun, Cathy Zhou, 21-Feb-13,
  <draft-zhou-mboned-multrans-path-optimization-03.txt>

    This document describes a mechanism to optimize the path between the
       multicast router and multicast source in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
       The basic idea is that when a multicast translation router has an
       IPv4 path and an IPv6 path to the same multicast data source, and
       both IPv4 and IPv6 joins are received, only one path is used.  One
       path is pruned, instead of the same traffic flowing over both v4 and
       v6 paths.  By adding a metric to the IPv4 path, the multicast
       translation router can determine which path to receive multicast
       data: IPv4 path, IPv6 path or both.  Therefore, an optimization path
       will typically be chosen when an identical v4/v6 traffic flow exists.

  "Domain Name Registration Data (DNRD) Objects Mapping", Francisco Arias,
  Gustavo Lozano, Shoji Noguchi, James Gould, Chethan Thippeswamy,
  4-Apr-13, <draft-arias-noguchi-dnrd-objects-mapping-03.txt>

    This document specifies the format, contents and semantics of Domain
       Name Registration Data (DNRD) Escrow deposits for a Domain Name
       Registry.

  "TRILL: Directory Assistance Mechanisms", Linda Dunbar, Donald Eastlake,
  Radia Perlman, Igor Gashinsky, Li Yizhou, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-dunbar-trill-scheme-for-directory-assist-04.txt>

    This document describes optional mechanisms for using directory
       server(s) to assist TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of
       Links) edge switches in reducing multi-destination traffic,
       particularly ARP/ND and unknown unicast flooding.

  "Trust Requirements in a Federated World", Josh Howlett, Rhys Smith,
  Margaret Wasserman, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-howlett-abfab-trust-router-ps-03.txt>

    TODO: This document outlines the requirements for trust in a
       federated environment, and enumerates the requirements for a trust
       infrastructure.  It also examines existing trust infrastructures
       given these requirements and concludes that none fulfil all of the
       requirements, and suggests that maybe a new one is required that
       does.

  "TFTP Windowsize Option", Patrick Masotta, 15-May-13,
  <draft-masotta-tftpexts-windowsize-opt-07.txt>

    The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, file
    transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a
    remote host.  One of its primary uses is the early stages of nodes
    booting from a Local Area Network. TFTP has been always used because
    it is very simple to implement. However, the choice of a lock-step
    schema is not the most efficient for use on a LAN.
    
    This document describes a TFTP option which allows the client and
    server to negotiate a windowsize of consecutive blocks to send
    as an alternative for replacing the single block lock-step schema.
    The TFTP Option Extension mechanism is described in [2].

  "Plasma Service Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Processing", Jim
  Schaad, 18-Mar-13, <draft-schaad-plasma-cms-04.txt>

    Secure MIME (S/MIME) defined a method of placing security labels on a
       Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) object.  These labels are placed
       as part of the data signed and validated by the parties.  This means
       that the message content is visible to the recipient prior to the
       label enforcement.  A new model for enforcement of policy using a
       third party is described in RFC TBD
       [I.D-draft-freeman-plasma-requirements].  This is the Policy
       Augmented S/MIME (PLASMA) system.  This document provides the details
       needed to implement the new Plasma model in the CMS infrastructure.
    
       An additional benefit of using the Plasma module is that the server,
       based on policy, manages who has access to the message and how the
       keys are protected.
    
       The document details how the client encryption and decryption
       processes are performed, defines how to construct the CMS recipient
       info structure, a new content to hold the data required for the
       Plasma server to store the keys and policy information.  The document
       does not cover the protocol between the client and the Plasma policy
       enforcement server.  One example of the client/server protocol can be
       found in RFC TBD [plasma-token].

  "LISP Traffic Engineering Use-Cases", Dino Farinacci, Parantap Lahiri,
  Michael Kowal, 7-Jan-13, <draft-farinacci-lisp-te-02.txt>

    This document describes how LISP reencapsulating tunnels can be used
       for Traffic Engineering purposes.  The mechanisms described in this
       document require no LISP protocol changes but do introduce a new
       locator (RLOC) encoding.  The Traffic Engineering features provided
       by these LISP mechanisms can span intra-domain, inter-domain, or
       combination of both.

  "End-to-End Session Identification in IP-Based Multimedia Communication
  Networks", Paul Jones, Chris Pearce, James Polk, Gonzalo Salgueiro,
  20-Feb-13, <draft-jones-insipid-session-id-02.txt>

    This document describes an end-to-end Session Identifier for use in
       IP-based Multimedia Communication systems that enables endpoints,
       intermediate devices, and management systems to identify a session

  "Securing Model-C Inter-Provider VPNs with Label Hopping and TicToc",
  Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, 8-Apr-13,
  <draft-mjsraman-l3vpn-tictoc-label-hop-03.txt>

    In certain models of inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label Switching
       (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) spoofing attack against
       VPN sites is a key concern. For example, MPLS-based VPN inter-
       provider model "C" is not favoured, owing to security concerns in the
       dataplane, even though it can scale with respect to maintenance of
       routing state. Since the inner labels associated with VPN sites are
       not encrypted during transmission, a man-in-themiddle attacker can
       spoof packets to a specific VPN site. In this paper, we propose a
       label-hopping technique which uses a set of randomized labels and a
       method for hopping amongst these labels using the time instant the
       packet leaves the port from a sending Provider Edge Router. To
       prevent the attacker from identifying the labels in polynomial time,
       we also use an additional label. The proposed technique can be
       applied to other variants of inter-provider MPLS based VPNs where
       Multi-Protocol exterior-BGP (MP-eBGP) multi-hop is used. As we
       address a key security concern, we can make a case for the deployment
       of MPLS based VPN inter-provider model "C". Specifically we use the
       TicToc based Precision Time Protocol LSP to provide the timing for
       determining the time instant at which the packet is sent from the
       remote end Provider Edge Router and hence calculating when it must
       have left that peer at the Provider Edge Router in the near /
       receiving end.
    
       This version of the document suggests a better method for gaining
       more finely granular time slices. This is done by running the PTP LSP
       between the ASBRs in the ASes that are providing the inter-AS L3VPN
       service.

  "Power Based Topologies and TE-Shortest Power Paths in OSPF", Shankar
  Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Vasan Srini, 27-Apr-13,
  <draft-mjsraman-rtgwg-ospf-power-topo-02.txt>

    In a Interior Gateway Protocol like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
       the computation of the Constrained shortest path to destinations is
       computed for an area say a backbone or a non-backbone area using the
       TE-metrics advertised in the area. With importance given to the
       reduction of power within a network it becomes important to provide a
       solution that reduces the power consumed amongst routers and links
       that make up the network (in this case an area or a collection of
       areas including the backbone and non-backbone areas). This proposal
       aims at providing such a solution by producing a power topology of
       the area / areas. This power topology is constructed by assigning
       metrics to links based on the power consumed by the linecards (and
       hence their respective ports in an indirect way) of adjacent routers
       that are interconnected by each such link.

  "Definition and Use of DNSSEC Negative Trust Anchors", Jason Livingood,
  Chris Griffiths, 22-Feb-13,
  <draft-livingood-negative-trust-anchors-06.txt>

    DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is now entering widespread
       deployment.  However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet
       as mature and reliable as is the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain
       administration tools and processes.  One potential technique to
       mitigate this is to use a Negative Trust Anchor, which is defined in
       this document.
    
       This document discusses Trust Anchors for DNSSEC and defines a
       Negative Trust Anchor, which is potentially useful during the
       transition to ubiquitous DNSSEC deployment.  These are configured
       locally on a particular instance of a validating DNS recursive
       resolver and can shield end users of such a resolver from the DNSSEC-
       related authoritative name server operational errors that appear to
       be somewhat typical during the transition to ubiquitous DNSSEC
       deployment.  Negative Trust Anchors are intended to be temporary, and
       should not be distributed by IANA or any other organization outside
       of the administrative boundary of the organization locally
       implementing a Negative Trust Anchor.  Finally, Negative Trust
       Anchors pertain only to DNSSEC and not to Public Key Infrastructures
       (PKI) such ad X.509.

  "CoRE Roadmap and Implementation Guide", Carsten Bormann, 1-May-13,
  <draft-bormann-core-roadmap-04.txt>

    The CoRE set of protocols, in particular the CoAP protocol, is
       defined in draft-ietf-core-coap in conjunction with a number of
       specifications that are currently nearing completion.  There are also
       several dozen more individual Internet-Drafts in various states of
       development, with various levels of WG review and interest.
    
       Today, this is simply a bewildering array of documents.  Beyond the
       main four documents, it is hard to find relevant information and
       assess the status of proposals.  At the level of Internet-Drafts, the
       IETF has only adoption as a WG document to assign status - too crude
       an instrument to assess the level of development and standing for
       anyone who does not follow the daily proceedings of the WG.
    
       With a more long-term perspective, as additional drafts mature and
       existing specifications enter various levels of spec maintenance, the
       entirety of these specifications may become harder to understand,
       pose specific implementation problems, or be simply inconsistent.
    
       The present guide aims to provide a roadmap to these documents as
       well as provide specific advice how to use these specifications in
       combination.  In certain cases, it may provide clarifications or even
       corrections to the specifications referenced.
    
       This guide is intended as a continued work-in-progress, i.e.  a long-
       lived Internet-Draft, to be updated whenever new information becomes
       available and new consensus on how to handle issues is formed.
       Similar to the ROHC implementation guide, RFC 4815, it might be
       published as an RFC at some future time later in the acceptance curve
       of the specifications.
    
       This document does not describe a new protocol or attempt to set a
       new standard of any kind - it mostly describes good practice in using
       the existing specifications, but it may also document emerging
       consensus where a correction needs to be made.

  "Reducing Power Consumption using BGP path selection", Shankar Raman,
  Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Vasan Srini, 27-Apr-13,
  <draft-mjsraman-rtgwg-bgp-power-path-04.txt>

    In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
       consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between
       Autonomous Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS
       and then use suitable modifications to the BGP path selection
       algorithm to route the packets along the paths. Such low-power paths
       can be identified by using the consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth
       (PWR) ratio as an additional parameter in the BGP Path Selection
       Algorithm. For re-routing the data traffic through these low-power
       paths, the power based best path is selected and advertised as per
       the modified algorithm proposed in this document. Extensions to the
       Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) can be used to disseminate the PWR
       ratio metric among the AS thereby creating a collaborative approach
       to reduce the power consumption. The feasibility of our approaches is
       illustrated by applying our algorithm to a subset of the Internet.
       The techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-AS power
       reduction require minimal modifications to the existing features of
       the Internet. The proposed techniques can be extended to other levels
       of Internet hierarchy, such as Intra-AS paths, through suitable
       modifications. A recent addition is the use of this method in AIGP
       domains and also the use of power source data in the calculation of
       low power paths using the BGP path selection algorithm.

  "LLN Fragment Forwarding and Recovery", Pascal Thubert, Jonathan Hui,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-thubert-roll-forwarding-frags-01.txt>

    In order to be routed, a fragmented packet must be reassembled at
       every hop of a multihop link where lower layer fragmentation occurs.
       Considering that the IPv6 minimum MTU is 1280 bytes and that an an
       802.15.4 frame can have a payload limited to 74 bytes in the worst
       case, a packet might end up fragmented into as many as 18 fragments
       at the 6LoWPAN shim layer.  If a single one of those fragments is
       lost in transmission, all fragments must be resent, further
       contributing to the congestion that might have caused the initial
       packet loss.  This draft introduces a simple protocol to forward and
       recover individual fragments that might be lost over multiple hops
       between 6LoWPAN endpoints.

  "Fundamental Architecture of Services Provider's network Transitioning
  to IPv6 (FAST6)", GuoLiang Yang, Yangchun Li, Cancan Huang, Jinhua Tan,
  Youming Wu, 1-Apr-13, <draft-yang-v6ops-fast6-02.txt>

    The IANA free pool of IPv4 addresses was depleted, IPv6 migration has
    become the most imperative task.  There are many transition
    mechanisms designed for different scenarios, however, some problems
    arosed in the practice.  FAST6, specified in this draft, is based on
    the ideas of native dual stack and address sharing.  It can solves
    the mixed route problem and simplify the planning of private IPv4
    address space by using tunnel technology.  FAST6 is an economical and
    stable technology for smooth network transition.

  "An M-party, N-state Game of Rochambeau", Dan Harkins, Paul Lambert,
  1-Apr-13, <draft-harkins-rochambeau-02.txt>

    A protocol for the fair selection and random distribution of a single
       winner in a game with an arbitrary number of players is described.

  "Definition of Managed Objects for the MANET Essential Connected
  Dominating Set (E-CDS) Process", James Nguyen, Robert Cole, 3-Jan-13,
  <draft-nguyen-manet-ecds-mib-02.txt>

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
    In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of the
    Essential Connected Dominating Set (E-CDS) process for Mobile Ad-Hoc
    Networks (MANETs).  The ECDS-MIB also reports state information,
    performance metrics, and notifications.  In addition to
    configuration, the additional state and performance information is
    useful to operators troubleshooting multicast forwarding problems.

  "File Transfer Protocol HASH Command for Cryptographic Hashes", Anthony
  Bryan, Tim Kosse, Daniel Stenberg, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-bryan-ftpext-hash-02.txt>

    The File Transfer Protocol does not offer any method to verify the
       integrity of a transferred file, nor can two files be compared
       against each other without actually transferring them first.
       Cryptographic hashes are a possible solution to this problem.  In the
       past, several attempts have been made to add commands to obtain
       checksums and hashes, however none have been formally specified,
       leading to non-interoperability and confusion.  To solve these
       issues, this document specifies a new FTP command to be used by
       clients to request cryptographic hashes of files.

  "Grazed and Lightweight Open Protocol (GaLOP), v. 1.0", Lukasz Ruminski,
  Michal Kutzner, Adrian Dymek, Szymon Kwiatkowski, Marcin Langa,
  18-Apr-13, <draft-ruminski-homenet-galop-proto-05.txt>

    This informational memo specifies a Grazed and Lightweight Open
           Protocol (GaLOP), designed to exchange information within the
           Hackney project [HACKNEY]. The document describes messages'
           structures, defined message types used in the communication and
           standard connection scenarios.

  "IPv6 RA Options for Multiple Interface Next Hop Routes", Behcet
  Sarikaya, 25-Feb-13, <draft-sarikaya-mif-6man-ra-route-02.txt>

    This draft defines new Router Advertisement options for configuring
       next hop routes on the mobile or fixed nodes.  Using these options,
       an operator can easily configure nodes with multiple interfaces (or
       otherwise multi-homed) to enable them to select the routes to a
       destination.  Each option is defined together with definitions of
       host and router behaviors.

  "Adaptation Layer Fragmentation Indication", Carsten Bormann, 10-Mar-13,
  <draft-bormann-intarea-alfi-03.txt>

    IPv6 defines a minimum MTU of 1280 bytes.  Many link layers are more
       limited in the maximum size of packets they can communicate.  In
       order to enable the transport of IP packets that are too large for
       these link layers, typically their IP adaptation layers define a
       segmentation or fragmentation scheme to transport an IP packet in a
       sequence of multiple link layer packets.
    
       Often, adaption layer fragmentation schemes reduce some performance
       metric, such as the packet delivery probability.  Application or
       transport protocols may be able to reduce the maximum size of packets
       they send, e.g.  by transport layer segmentation or choice of
       application layer data object size, which may have less of a
       performance impact.  It would therefore be desirable for them to know
       about any adaptation layer fragmentation that is going on, so they
       can choose packet sizes that minimize adaptation layer fragmentation.
    
       At the IP layer, fragmentation can be detected using a number of
       mechanisms used in Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery [RFC4821].
       However, adaptation layer fragmentation schemes are often designed to
       be "transparent", i.e.  there is no way at higher layers to find out
       whether they had to be employed (except maybe by elaborate
       measurement schemes targeting one of the impacted performance
       metrics; this approach does not appear to be viable) [WEI].
    
       The present specification defines a mechanism for IPv6 adaptation
       layers to indicate the presence of adaptation layer fragmentation on
       one or more hops on the path from an IP sender to an IP receiver, and
       to provide an indication of preferred (smaller) packet sizes on these
       hops.
    
       The main objective of this version of the draft is to present a
       complete design in order to be able to gauge the complexity of the
       approach against the gains to be expected from implementing it.
    
       Comments are appreciated and should go to the intarea@ietf.org
       mailing list.

  "Representing phonetics for Japanese names in Atom feeds", Murata
  Makoto, 17-Mar-13, <draft-murata-atom-phonetics-03.txt>

    This specification introduces an attribute for representing Japanese
       phonetics within feeds of the Atom Syndication Format [RFC4287].
       Such phonetics MAY be attached to author names and article titles.
       This attribute is applicable to OPDS(Open Publication Distribution
       System)[OPDS], which is based on Atom.

  "Supercharged Codes", Erik Stauffer, BZ Shen, Soumen Chakraborty,
  Djordje Tujkovic, Jing Huang, Shiv Shet, Kamlesh Rath, 29-Mar-13,
  <draft-stauffer-rmt-bb-fec-supercharged-02.txt>

    This document describes a fully-specified FEC scheme for the
    Supercharged forward error correction code.  Supercharged codes are
    designed for use on the erasure channel.  Coding for the erasure
    channel commonly arises for data transmission over the internet, where
    lower layers either successfully deliver packets or fail to deliver
    them.  Coding is required to insure that data is not lost, even if
    packets are lost at the lower layers.  Error free reception is
    important for multimedia applications, such as streaming, where it may
    not be possible to correct an error in time by any other means.  Coding
    insures that lost packets can be recovered.

  "Constructing inter-AS power shortest protection TE-LSPs using BGP",
  Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Vasan Srini, 29-Jan-13,
  <draft-mjsraman-rtgwg-inter-as-psp-protect-02.txt>

    In this paper, we propose a framework to build protection / backup
       paths for power shortest primary inter-AS TE-LSPs. The primary path
       is built within a framework to reduce the aggregate power consumption
       of the Internet using a collaborative approach between Autonomous
       Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS and then
       use Traffic Engineering (TE) techniques to route the packets along
       the paths. Such low-power paths can be identified by using the
       consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth (PWR) ratio as an additional
       constraint in the Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm.
       For re-routing the data traffic through these low-power paths, the
       Inter-AS Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans
       multiple AS can be used.
    
       Once the primary paths have been built we use the same techniques to
       build backup power shortest paths in a similar manner except by
       excluding the nodes (ASes) and links (between these ASes) that are
       present in the primary path. This way the backup path does not
       traverse any of the ASes or links between these ASes of the primary
       path so constructed.
    
       Extensions to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) can be used to
       disseminate the PWR ratio metric among the AS thereby creating a
       collaborative approach to reduce the power consumption. Since
       calculating the low-power paths can be computationally intensive, a
       graph-labeling heuristic is also proposed. This heuristic reduces the
       computational complexity but may provide a sub-optimal low-power
       path. The feasibility of our approaches is illustrated by applying
       our algorithm to a subset of the Internet. The techniques proposed in
       this paper for the Inter-AS power reduction require minimal
       modifications to the existing features of the Internet. The proposed
       techniques can be extended to other levels of Internet hierarchy,
       such as Intra-AS paths, through suitable modifications.

  "Operational Considerations for Tunnel Fragmentation and Reassembly",
  Fred Templin, 27-Mar-13, <draft-generic-v6ops-tunmtu-13.txt>

    The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for popular IP-in-IP tunnels is
       currently recommended to be set to 1500 (or less) minus the length of
       the encapsulation headers when static MTU determination is used.
       This requires the tunnel ingress to either fragment any IP packet
       larger than the MTU or drop the packet and return an ICMP Packet Too
       Big (PTB) message.  Concerns for operational issues with Path MTU
       Discovery (PMTUD) point to the possibility of MTU-related black holes
       when a packet is dropped due to an MTU restriction.  The current
       "Internet cell size" is effectively 1500 bytes (i.e., the minimum MTU
       configured by the vast majority of links in the Internet) and should
       therefore also be the minimum MTU assigned to tunnels, but this has
       proven to be problematic in common operational practice.  This
       document therefore discusses operational considerations for tunnel
       fragmentation and reassembly necessary to accommodate this Internet
       cell size.

  "Trust Assertions for Certificate Keys", Moxie Marlinspike, 7-Jan-13,
  <draft-perrin-tls-tack-02.txt>

    This document defines a TLS Extension that enables a TLS server to
       support "pinning" to a self-chosen signing key.  A client contacting
       a pinned host will require the server to present a signature from the
       signing key over the TLS server's public key.

  "Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) OpenFlow Model
  Library", Evangelos Haleplidis, Omar Cherkaoui, Susan Hares, Weiming
  Wang, 25-Apr-13, <draft-haleplidis-forces-openflow-lib-03.txt>

    This document describes the OpenFlow switch in Logical Function
       Blocks (LFBs) used in the Forwarding and Control Element Separation
       (ForCES).  The LFB classes are defined according to the ForCES
       Forwading Element (FE) model and ForCES protocol specifications.  The
       library includes the descriptions of the OpenFlow LFBs and the XML

  "CoAP Payload-Length Option Extension", Kepeng Li, Xianghui Sun,
  26-Jan-13, <draft-li-core-coap-payload-length-option-01.txt>

    This document defines an extension to the Constrained Application
       Protocol (CoAP) to add one new option: Payload-Length, which is used
       to indicate the length of the payload of the message.

  "Conference Focus Indicating CCMP Support", Rifaat Shekh-Yusef, Mary
  Barnes, 10-May-13, <draft-yusef-dispatch-ccmp-indication-04.txt>

    The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol document defines a
       way for a client to discover a conference control server that
       supports CCMP. However, it does not define a way for a client
       involved in a conference to determine if the conference focus
       supports CCMP. This information would allow a CCMP-enabled client
       that joins a conference using SIP to also register for the XCON
       conference event package RFC 4575 [RFC4575] and take advantage of
       CCMP operations on the conference.
    
       This document describes a few options to address the above limitation
       with the pros and cons for each approach, and recommends two to be
       used depending on the need of the UA. The first approach uses the
       Call-Info header and as a result this document updates RFC 3261
       [RFC3261]. The second approach defines a new value for the 'purpose'
       parameter in the 'service-uris' element in the SIP conferencing event
       package, and as a result this document updates RFC 4575 [RFC4575].

  "ICTP - Information Centric Transport Protocol for CONET ICN", Stefano
  Salsano, Andrea Detti, Nicola Blefari-Melazzi, Matteo Cancellieri,
  20-Jun-13, <draft-salsano-ictp-02.txt>

    Let us consider an Information Centric Networking (ICN) solution, in
       which an End Node requests for a content sending "content requests"
       (or "interest packets").  The content is provided back to the
       requestor by the "origin" node or by an intermediate node that had
       cached the content.  The content is usually divided into "chunks"
       that can be individually requested, sent back to the requester,
       cached into intermediate nodes.  The sending rate of content requests
       can be adjusted in order to perform congestion control, implementing
       a receiver driven transport protocol.  As it can be useful to have
       large chunks (significantly larger than the Maximum Tranfer Unit
       across the network), the transport protocol should also be used to
       further segment the chunks rather than relying to IP fragmentation.
       In this memo we define ICTP (Information Centric Transport Protocol),
       a receiver driven transport protocol for ICN, which relies on the
       CONET ICN solution described in a companion draft.

  "Omniscient AS112 Servers", Warren Kumari, William Sotomayor, Joe Abley,
  Ray Bellis, 20-Jun-13, <draft-wkumari-dnsop-omniscient-as112-03.txt>

    The AS112 Project loosely coordinates Domain Name System (DNS)
       servers to which DNS zones corresponding to private use addresses are
       delegated.  Queries for names within those zones have no useful
       responses in a global context.  The purpose of this project is to
       reduce the load of such junk queries on the authoritative name
       servers that would otherwise receive them, and instead direct the
       load to name servers operated within the AS112 project.
    
       Due to the loosely-coordinated nature of the project, adding and
       dropping zones from the AS112 servers is difficult.  This document
       proposes a mechanism by which AS112 name servers could answer
       authoritatively for all possible zones.  This eliminates the add/drop
       problem, changing it to a matter of delegation within the DNS and
       requiring no operational changes on the servers themselves.
    
       This document updates RFC 6304.

  "JSON Hypertext Application Language", Mike Kelly, 12-Feb-13,

  "Using DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and DNS-based Authentication of
  Named Entities (DANE) as a Prooftype for XMPP Domain Name Associations",
  Matthew Miller, Peter Saint-Andre, 22-Feb-13,
  <draft-miller-xmpp-dnssec-prooftype-04.txt>

    This document defines a prooftype that uses DNS-based Authentication
       of Named Entities (DANE) for associating a domain name with an XML
       stream in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  It
       also defines a method that uses DNS Security (DNSSEC) for securely
       delegating a source domain to a derived domain in XMPP.

  "Indoor Signal Position Conveyance", Kipp Jones, Christopher Steger,
  8-May-13, <draft-jones-geopriv-sigpos-survey-02.txt>

    Location Information Servers rely on signal surveys to create a
       signal map allowing for subsequent device location determination.
       This document describes a method by which a Survey Device is able to
       provide indoor location related measurement data to a LIS for
       positioning purposes.  Location related measurement information
       comprises observations concerning properties related to the position
       of a Survey Device and the radio, electromagnetic, and other
       observable environmental measures as perceived by the Survey Device.
       These measurements could be data about Wi-Fi signals, Bluetooth
       signals, barometric pressure, or any other environmental measurement
       which could sent to a LIS for subsequent processing to help determine
       the location of devices that later enter the venue.  A basic set of
       location-related measurements, data rights disclosure and location
       types are defined.

  "CoAP Profile Description Format", Bert Greevenbosch, Jeroen Hoebeke,
  Isam Ishaq, Floris Van den Abeele, 20-Jun-13,
  <draft-greevenbosch-core-profile-description-02.txt>

    This document provides a profile description format, that can be used
       to express capabilities of a CoAP server.
    
    Note
    
       Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should
       be sent to core@ietf.org.

  "Definition of Managed Objects for the Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc
  Distance-vector Routing Protocol - Next Generation (LOADng)", Ulrich
  Herberg, Robert Cole, Thomas Clausen, 7-Jan-13,
  <draft-herberg-lln-loadng-mib-02.txt>

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
       for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
       In particular, it describes objects for configuring parameters of the
       Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol - Next
       Generation (LOADng) process on a router.  The MIB module defined in
       this memo, denoted LOADng-MIB, also reports state.  While LOADng is
       layer agnostic and can be run with different address families (e.g.,
       on L2 using MAC addreses, or on L3 using IP addresss), this MIB
       module assumes that LOADng is used on L3, and uses only IPv4/IPv6
       addresses.

  "A New HTTP Status Code to Report Legal Obstacles", Tim Bray, 11-Jan-13,
  <draft-tbray-http-legally-restricted-status-02.txt>

    This document specifies an additional Hypertext Transfer Protocol
       (HTTP) status code for use when resource access is denied due to
       legal demands.

  "Link relation Type Registrations for OAuth 2", William Mills, 4-Feb-13,
  <draft-wmills-oauth-lrdd-07.txt>

    Defines link relation type registrations for the OAuth 2
    authentication framework and OAuth 1.0a.

  "DNS Extension for Autonomous Internet(AIP)", Yuping Diao, Diao
  Yongping, Ming Liao, 23-Jun-13, <draft-diao-aip-dns-03.txt>

    With the reality of Internet, Autonomous Internet technology
       in this article constructs independent autonomous extensible domain
       name architecture and domain name hierarchy through current domain
       name architecture, provides independent root DNS server, inner/outer
       DNS resolution mechanism for each autonomous internet network system,
       and provides reformation and transition solution from current
       Internet to realize autonomy even in unilateral action.

  "NVO3 Operational Requirements", Peter Ashwood-Smith, Ranga Iyengar,
  Tina Tsou, Ali Sajassi, Mohamed Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet, Masahiro
  Daikoku, 31-Jan-13, <draft-ashwood-nvo3-operational-requirement-02.txt>

    This document provides framework and requirements for Network
       Virtualization over Layer 3 (NVO3) Operations, Administration, and
       Maintenance (OAM).  This document for the most part gathers
       requirements from existing IETF drafts and RFCs which have already
       extensively studied this subject for different data planes and
       layering.  As a result this draft is high level and broad.  We begin
       to ask which are truly required for NVO3 and expect the list to be
       narrowed by the working group as subsequent versions of this draft
       are created.

  "IP Fast Re-Route with Fast Notification", Andras Csaszar, Gabor Envedi,
  Jeff Tantsura, Sriganesh Kini, John Sucec, Subir Das, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-csaszar-rtgwg-ipfrr-fn-01.txt>

    This document describes the benefits and main applications of sending
       explicit fast notification (FN) packets to routers in an area. FN
       packets are generated and processed in the dataplane, and a single FN
       service can substitute existing OAM methods for remote failure
       detection, such as a full mesh of multi-hop BFD session. The FN
       service, therefore, decreases network overhead considerable. The main
       application is fast reroute in pure IP and in IP/LDP-MPLS networks
       called IPFRR-FN. The detour paths used when IPFRR-FN is active are in
       most cases identical to those used after Interior Gateway Protocol
       (IGP) convergence. The proposed mechanism can address all single
       link, node, and SRLG failures in an area; moreover it is an efficient
       solution to protect against BGP ASBR failures as well as VPN PE
       router failures. IPFRR-FN can be a supplemental tool to provide FRR
       when LFA cannot repair a failure case, while it can be a replacement
       of existing ASBR/PE protection mechanisms by overcoming their
       scalability and complexity issues.

  "An FTP Application Layer Gateway (ALG) for IPv4-to-IPv6 Translation",
  Tina Tsou, Simon Perreault, Jing Huang, 15-Jun-12,
  <draft-tsou-behave-ftp46-00.txt>

    An FTP ALG for NAT64 was defined in RFC 6384.  Its scope was limited
    to an IPv6 client connecting to an IPv4 server.  This memo updates
    RFC 6384 with the case of an IPv4 client connecting to an IPv6
    server.

  "Stateless IPv4 Network Address Translation", Tina Tsou, Will Liu, Simon
  Perreault, Reinaldo Penno, Maoke Chen, 22-Oct-12,
  <draft-tsou-stateless-nat44-02.txt>

    This memo describes a protocol for decentralizing IPv4 NAT to the
    customer-premises equipment (CPE) such that no state information is
    kept on the central NAT device.  The CPE uses a restricted source
    port set that is encoded in its provisioned IPv4 WAN address.  The
    NAT device performs only strictly stateless address (not port)
    translation.

  "Indication of support for reverse keep-alive", Christer Holmberg, Oscar
  Gallego, 17-Jun-13, <draft-holmberg-sipcore-rkeep-02.txt>

    This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
       Via header field parameter, "rkeep".  The "rkeep" parameter allows a
       SIP entity to indicate willingness to receive keep-alives from its
       adjacent downstream SIP entity, the adjacent downstream SIP entity to
       indicate willingness to send keep-alives, and for SIP entities
       willing to send keep-alives to inform the receiver about the keep-
       alive interval.

  "An SNMP MIB extension to RFC3591 to manage optical interface parameters
  of DWDM applications", Gabriele Galimberti, Ruediger Kunze, Dharini
  Hiremagalur, 23-Feb-13, <draft-galikunze-ccamp-g-698-2-snmp-mib-02.txt>

    This memo defines a module of the Management Information Base (MIB)
       used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in TCP/IP- based
       internets.  In particular, it defines objects for managing Optical
       parameters associated with Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
       (DWDM) interfaces or characterized by the Optical Transport Network
       (OTN).  This is an extension of the RFC3591 to support the optical
       parameters mainly but not only described in recommendations like
       ITU-T G.698.2.  [ITU.G698.2]
    
       The MIB module defined in this memo can be used for Optical
       Parameters monitoring and/or configuration of the endpoints of Black
       Links.

  "Request Routing and Content Acquisition", Ge Chen, Mian Li, Hongfei
  Xia, Jie Liang, 24-Dec-12,
  <draft-chen-cdni-rr-content-acquisition-01.txt>

    This document illustrates the details of an alternative method that
       can be used to provide request routing and content acquisition
       services.

  "OmniBroker Protocol", Phillip Hallam-Baker, 13-Jun-13,
  <draft-hallambaker-omnibroker-04.txt,.pdf>

    An Omnibroker is an agent chosen and trusted by an Internet user to
       provide information such as name and certificate status information
       that are in general trusted even if they are not trustworthy.  Rather
       than acting as a mere conduit for information provided by existing
       services, an Omnibroker is responsible for curating those sources to
       protect the user.
    
       The Omnibroker Protocol (OBP) provides an aggregated interface to
       trusted Internet services including DNS, OCSP and various forms of
       authentication service.  Multiple transport bindings are supported to
       permit efficient access in virtually every common deployment scenario
       and ensure access in any deployment scenario in which access is not
       being purposely denied.

  "Using PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH) as a Prooftype for XMPP Domain Name
  Associations", Matthew Miller, Peter Saint-Andre, 22-Feb-13,
  <draft-miller-xmpp-posh-prooftype-03.txt>

    This document defines a prooftype involving PKIX over Secure HTTP
       (POSH) for associating a domain name with an XML stream in the
       Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  It also defines a
       method involving HTTPS redirects (appropriate for use with the POSH
       prooftype) for securely delegating a source domain to a derived
       domain in XMPP.

  "Domain Name Associations (DNA) in the Extensible Messaging and Presence
  Protocol (XMPP)", Peter Saint-Andre, Matthew Miller, 15-Apr-13,
  <draft-saintandre-xmpp-dna-02.txt>

    This document improves the security of the Extensible Messaging and
       Presence Protocol (XMPP) in two ways.  First, it specifies how
       "prooftypes" can establish a strong association between a domain name
       and an XML stream.  Second, it describes how to securely delegate a
       source domain to a derived domain, which is especially important in
       virtual hosting environments.

  "Use Cases for ALTO with Software Defined Networks", Haiyong Xie, Tina
  Tsou, Diego Lopez, Hongtao Yin, 9-Jan-13,
  <draft-xie-alto-sdn-extension-use-cases-01.txt>

    The introduction of SDN fundamentally changes the way that the
       application layer traffic optimization (ALTO) works.  This draft
       describes two architectures, the Vertical Architecture and the
       Horizontal Architecture, allowing coherent coexistence of ALTO and
       software defined network (SDN).  Unique requirements for design and
       operations are identified and summarized, suggesting that the
       Vertical Architecture allows better division, management,
       flexibility, privacy control and long-term evolution of the network.
       We also define the main interactions and information flows, and
       present a set of use cases to illustrate how we extend ALTO to
       support SDN, in the Vertical Architecture.

  "CDNI Request Routing with SDN", Myung-Ki Shin, Seungik Lee, Dukhyun
  Chang, Ted Kwon, 13-Feb-13, <draft-shin-cdni-request-routing-sdn-01.txt>

    Software-defined networking (SDN) is emerging and intensively
       discussed as one of the most promising technologies to provide
       centralized, programmable control planes for network service
       providers (NSPs). In this sense, SDN could be also considered as one
       of candidates to facilitate CDNI Request Routing. This document
       discusses how SDN can be used for downstream CDN selection within
       CDNI request routing.

  "Emergency Services Support in WebRTC", Bernard Aboba, Martin Thomson,
  13-Jun-13, <draft-aboba-rtcweb-ecrit-01.txt>

    The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) framework supports
       interactive communication between web-browsers, including support for
       audio, video and text.  This document describes how emergency
       services functionality can be implemented within the WebRTC
       framework, including support for location and call routing as well as
       interoperability with Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs)
       supporting next generation emergency services.

  "VPWS support in E-VPN", Sami Boutros, Ali Sajassi, Samer Salam, John
  Drake, Jeff Tantsura, 25-Feb-13, <draft-boutros-l2vpn-evpn-vpws-01.txt>

    This document describes how E-VPN can be used to support virtual
       private wire service (VPWS) in MPLS/IP networks. E-VPN enables the
       following characteristics for VPWS: active/standby as well as
       active/active multi-homing with flow-based load-balancing, eliminates
       the need for single-segment and multi-segment PW signaling, and
       provides fast protection using data-plane prefix independent
       convergence upon node or link failure.

  "Routing optimization in DMM", Kaiping Xue, Lin Li, Peilin Hong, Pete
  McCann, 20-Jun-13, <draft-xue-dmm-routing-optimization-02.txt>

    This draft proposes a PMIP-based routing optimization method in
       distributed anchor architecture.  The anchor of the mobile node is
       able to communicate with the anchor of corresponding node directly
       using optimized routing.  In this draft, there are two modes for the
       setup of routing optimization: the direct mode and the relay mode.
       The difference between them lies in that whether the routing
       optimization is set up directly or under the assistance of a third
       anchor.  The situation that Communication Node(CN) is a fixed
       terminal or a content server is also considered and 3 solutions are
       provided correspondingly.  The method proposed in this draft can
       reduce the delay and save signaling overhead in the current scheme.

  "TMPP for Both Two MPTCP-unaware Hosts", Kaiping Xue, Jing Guo, Peilin
  Hong, Lei Zhu, 20-Jun-13, <draft-xue-mptcp-tmpp-unware-hosts-02.txt>

    Transparent MPTCP Proxy(TMPP) is an introduced network-based
       function, which is under MPTCP architecture.  It can help two MPTCP-
       unaware hosts enjoy multipath support, and can be extensively used
       both in the access networks and operators' networks.  Meanwhile, in
       MPTCP architecture with TMPP, TMPP needs to modify the received
       packets and transmit them again(just like gateway in NAT
       environment).  In this document, we also discuss the guarantee for
       data transfer on TMPP's side.  The consideration of data transfer can
       be expanded to the MPTCP architecture with proxy.

  "Flow Mobility In Multi-LMA Environment", Kaiping Xue, Dan Ni, Peilin
  Hong, Anthony Chan, 20-Jun-13, <draft-xue-netext-flowmo-multilma-02.txt>

    PMIPv6 allows multiple Local Mobility Anchors(LMA) to exist in a
       PMIPv6 domain, it MAY cause that different interfaces of a mobile
       node(MN) are anchored in different LMAs.  This document proposes the
       extensions of Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol to support flow mobility in
       multi-LMA environment.  Among all the scenarios discussed here, the
       scenario in which different interfaces with different MAGs in multi-
       LMA environment cannot use traditional ways to realize flow mobility
       to an existing interface.

  "Path Computation Element (PCE) Extensions for Link State Conflict
  Avoidance Mechanism in Optical Transport Networks", Xuefeng Lin, Li Xin,
  Jie Zhang, Min Zhang, Hongxiang Wang, 1-Jan-13,
  <draft-huangshg-pce-conflict-avoidance-01.txt>

    This document proposes a PCE based link state conflict avoidance
       mechanism.  Path Computation Element (PCE) can compute a network path
       or route based on the information stored in Traffic Engineering
       Database (TED) and TED collects the link resources information
       through the OSPF-TE protocol.  The proposed conflict avoidance
       mechanism gives each link two state which respectively represents the
       resource in this link is changed or not.  The extended OSPF-TE
       protocol will also flood the link state information when it floods
       the link resources information.  PCE will add the link state to the
       calculated path when it returns the calculated path to Path
       Computation Clients (PCC).  When the RSVP-TE protocol reserves the
       resource along the calculated path, it will compare the link state
       stored in the calculated path with the link state stored in the
       local.  If the link state between the calculated path and the local
       is inconsistent then the RSVP-TE protocol will stop the resource
       reservation process, release the reserved resource and promote the
       OSPF-TE protocol to flood the Link resources information immediately.

  "LISP ITR Graceful Restart", Damien Saucez, Olivier Bonaventure, Luigi
  Iannone, Clarence Filsfils, 26-Dec-12,
  <draft-saucez-lisp-itr-graceful-01.txt>

    The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) is a map-and-encap
       mechanism to enable the communication between hosts identified with
       their Endpoint IDentifier (EID) over the Internet where EIDs are not
       routable.  To do so, packets toward EIDs are encapsulated in packets
       with routing locators (RLOCs) to form dynamic tunnels.  An Ingress
       Tunnel Router (ITR) that encapsulates EID packets determines tunnel
       endpoints via mappings that associate EIDs to RLOCs.  Before
       encapsulating a packet, the ITR queries the mapping system to obtain
       the mapping associated to the EID of the packet it must encapsulate.
       Such mapping is cached by the ITR in its local EID-to-RLOC cache for
       any subsequent encapsulation for the same EID.  LISP is scalable
       because the EID-to-RLOC cache of an ITR, which is initially empty, is
       populated progressively according to the traffic going through the
       ITR.  However, after an ITR is restarted, e.g., for maintenance
       reason, its cache is empty which means that all packets that are re-
       routed to the freshly restarted ITR will cause cache misses and a
       potentially high loss rate.  In this draft, we present mechanisms to
       reduce the negative impact on traffic caused by the restart of an ITR
       in a LISP network.

  "A Roadmap for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Specification
  Documents", Martin Duke, Robert Braden, Wesley Eddy, Ethan Blanton,
  Alexander Zimmermann, 21-May-13,
  <draft-zimmermann-tcpm-tcp-rfc4614bis-02.txt,.pdf>

    This document contains a "roadmap" to the Requests for Comments (RFC)
       documents relating to the Internet's Transmission Control Protocol
       (TCP).  This roadmap provides a brief summary of the documents
       defining TCP and various TCP extensions that have accumulated in the
       RFC series.  This serves as a guide and quick reference for both TCP
       implementers and other parties who desire information contained in
       the TCP-related RFCs.

  "IPv6 Path MTU Updates", Fred Templin, 14-Jan-13,
  <draft-generic-6man-tunfrag-07.txt>

    IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the
       network.  Instead, links with restricting Maximum Transmission Units
       (MTUs) must either drop each too-large packet and return an ICMPv6
       Packet Too Big (PTB) message or perform link-specific fragmentation
       and reassembly (also known as "link adaptation") at a layer below
       IPv6.  This latter category of links is often performance-challenged
       to accommodate steady-state link adaptation.  A common case that
       exhibits these link characteristics is seen for IPv6-in-IP tunnels.
       Additionally, IPv6 nodes can avoid path MTU discovery issues even
       when no link adaptation is necessary by performing a small amount of
       fragmentation and/or by probing the path as necessary.  This document
       therefore proposes an update to the base IPv6 specification to better
       accommodate path MTU issues.

  "Loop Free RPL", Jianlin Guo, Philip Orlik, Ghulam Bhatti, 27-Dec-12,
  <draft-guo-roll-loop-free-rpl-01.txt>

    IETF has been developing IPv6 based standards for Low-power and Lossy
       Networks (LLNs) to meet requirements of constrained applications,
       such as field monitoring, inventory control and so on. IPv6 Routing
       Protocol for LLNs (RPL) has been published in [RFC6550]. Based on
       routing metrics and constraints [RFC6551], RPL builds Directed
       Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology to establish bidirectional routes for
       LLNs for traffic types of multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint,
       and point-to-point. RPL routes are optimized for traffic to or from
       one or more roots that act as sinks. As a result, a DAG is
       partitioned into one or more Destination Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), one
       DODAG per sink. RPL is widely considered as a feasible routing
       protocol for LLNs. However, DODAG loops and lack of a loop free DODAG
       local repair mechanism are two open issues to be addressed. This
       draft introduces an alternative rank and an Objective Function to
       eliminate DODAG loops in RPL. Based on the proposed rank and
       Objective Function, this draft introduces a loop free RPL.

  "Connecting Disparate TRILL-based Data Center/PBB/Campus sites using
  BGP", Radia Perlman, Bhargav Bhikkaji, Balaji Venkataswami,
  Ramasubramani Mahadevan, Shivakumar Sundaram, Narayana Swamy, 19-Feb-13,
  <draft-balaji-l2vpn-trill-over-ip-multi-level-03.txt>

    There is a need to connect (a) TRILL based data centers or (b) TRILL
       based networks which provide Provider Backbone like functionalities
       or (c) Campus TRILL based networks over the WAN using one or more
       ISPs that provide regular IP+GRE or IP+MPLS transport. Some of the
       solutions proposed as in [DRAFT-EVPN] have not dealt with the
       scalable methods in their details as to how these services could be
       provided such that multiple TRILL sites can be inter-connected with
       issues like nick-name collisions for unicast and multicast being
       taken care of. It has been found that with extensions to BGP and a
       scalable method on Provider edge devices the problem statement which
       we will define below can be handled. Specifically the division of the
       nick-name into site-id and Rbridge-ID is one that can limit the
       number of sites that can be interconnected and the number of Rbridges
       within each such site that can be provisioned. The draft proposed
       herein deals / overcomes these issues by not limiting the number of
       sites and Rbridges within a TRILL site interconnect. Only the maximum
       space for a nick-name which happens to be 16 bits is the actual
       limit. MAC moves across TRILL sites and within TRILL sites can also
       be realized. This document / proposal envisions the use of BGP-MAC-
       VPN vrfs at the ISP cloud PE devices. We deal in depth with the
       control plane and data plane particulars for unicast and multicast in
       this scheme. Additionally Provider Backbone like functionality is
       also covered.

  "Practices for scaling ARP and ND for large data centers", Linda Dunbar,
  Warren Kumari, Igor Gashinsky, 13-Mar-13,
  <draft-dunbar-armd-arp-nd-scaling-practices-07.txt>

    This draft documents some operational practices that allow ARP/ND
    to scale in data center environments.

  "Problem Details for HTTP APIs", Mark Nottingham, Erik Wilde, 3-Jun-13,
  <draft-nottingham-http-problem-04.txt>

    This document defines a "problem detail" as a way to carry machine-
       readable details of errors in a HTTP response, to avoid the need to
       invent new error response formats for HTTP APIs.
    
    Note to Readers
    
       This draft should be discussed on the apps-discuss mailing list [1].

  "Managing and removing automatic version rollback in TLS Clients", Yngve
  Pettersen, 9-Jan-13,
  <draft-pettersen-tls-version-rollback-removal-01.txt>

    Ever since vendors started deploying TLS 1.0 clients, these clients
       have had to handle server implementations that do not tolerate the
       TLS version supported by the client, usually by automatically
       signaling an older supported version instead.  Such version rollbacks
       represent a potential security hazard, if the older version should
       become vulnerable to attacks.  The same history repeated when TLS
       Extensions were introduced, as some servers would not negotiate with
       clients that sent these protocol extensions, forcing clients to
       reduce protocol functionality in order to maintain interoperability.
    
       This document outlines a procedure to help clients decide when they
       may use version rollback to maintain interoperability with legacy
       servers, under what conditions the clients should not allow version
       rollbacks, such as when the server has indicated support for the TLS
       Renegotiation Information extension.  The intention of this procedure
       is to limit the use of automatic version rollback to legacy servers
       and eventually eliminate its use.

  "TRILL Resilient Distribution Trees", Mingui Zhang, Tissa Senevirathne,
  Janardhanan Pathangi, Ayan Banerjee, Anoop Ghanwani, 23-Apr-13,
  <draft-zhang-trill-resilient-trees-02.txt>

    TRILL protocol provides layer 2 multicast data forwarding using IS-IS
       link state routing. Distribution trees are computed based on the link
       state information through Shortest Path First calculation and shared
       among VLANs across the campus. When a link on the distribution tree
       fails, a campus-wide recovergence of this distribution tree will take
       place, which can be time consuming and may cause considerable
       disruption to the ongoing multicast service.
    
       This document proposes to build the backup distribution tree to
       protect links on the primary distribution tree. Since the backup
       distribution tree is built up ahead of the link failure, when a link
       on the primary distribution tree fails, the pre-installed backup
       forwarding table will be utilized to deliver multicast packets
       without waiting for the campus-wide recovergence, which minimizes the
       service disruption.

  "Metalink/XML Clients, Publishers, and Caches", Anthony Bryan, Tatsuhiro
  Tsujikawa, Neil McNab, 17-Jan-13, <draft-bryan-metalink-client-02.txt>

    This document specifies behavior for Metalink/XML clients,
       publishers, and proxy caches.  Metalink XML files contain multiple
       download locations (mirrors and Peer-to-Peer), cryptographic hashes,
       digital signatures, and other information.  Metalink clients can use
       this information to make file transfers more robust and reliable.
       Normative requirements for Metalink/XML clients, publishers, and
       proxy caches are described here.

  "Framework and Requirements for GMPLS based control of Flexi-grid DWDM
  networks", Oscar de Dios, Ramon Casellas, Fatai Zhang, Xihua Fu, Daniele
  Ceccarelli, Iftekhar Hussain, 5-Jun-13,
  <draft-ogrcetal-ccamp-flexi-grid-fwk-03.txt>

    This document defines a framework and the associated control plane
       requirements for the GMPLS based control of flexi-grid DWDM networks.
       To allow efficient allocation of optical spectral bandwidth for high
       bit-rate systems, the International Telecommunication Union
       Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has extended the
       recommendations [G.694.1] and [G.872] to include the concept of
       flexible grid.  A new DWDM grid has been developed within the ITU-T
       Study Group 15 by defining a set of nominal central frequencies,
       channel spacings and the concept of "frequency slot".  In such
       environment, a data plane connection is switched based on allocated,
       variable-sized frequency ranges within the optical spectrum.

  "Enhanced Sleepy Node Support for CoAP", Akbar Rahman, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-rahman-core-sleepy-02.txt>

    CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained devices.
       These devices typically have some combination of limited battery
       power, small memory footprint and low throughput links.  It is
       expected that in CoAP networks there will be a certain portion of
       devices that are "sleepy" and which may occasionally go into a sleep
       mode (i.e. go into a low power state to conserve power) and
       temporarily suspend CoAP protocol communication.  This document
       proposes a minimal and efficient mechanism building on the Resource
       Directory concept to enhance sleepy node support in CoAP networks.

  "MSML Package for the Media Control Channel Framework", Adnan Saleem,
  Steve Dunn, 31-Dec-12, <draft-saleem-mediactrl-msml-package-01.txt>

    The Media Server Markup Language [RFC5707] is used to control and
       invoke many different types of services on IP media servers. MSML can
       be used, for example, to control media server conferencing features
       such as video layout and audio mixing, create sidebar conferences or
       personal mixes, and set the properties of media streams.  As well,
       clients can use MSML to define media processing dialogs, which may be
       used as parts of application interactions with users or conferences.
       This document describes the use of MSML [RFC5707] language used
       within the context of Media Control Channel Framework [RFC6230]. The
       use of MSML [RFC5707] is described here as a standalone package for
       use within and compliant with the Media Control Channel Framework
       [RFC6230].

  "Deprecation of AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET in BGP", Warren Kumari,
  Kotikalapudi Sriram, 6-Jan-13,
  <draft-kumari-deprecate-as-set-confed-set-01.txt>

    RFC 6472 (i.e., BCP 172) recommends not using AS_SET and
       AS_CONFED_SET in BGP.  This document updates RFC 4271 and proscribes
       the use of the AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET types of the AS_PATH in
       BGPv4.  This is done to simplify the design and implementation of BGP
       and to make the semantics of the originator of a route more clear.
       This will also simplify the design, implementation, and deployment of
       ongoing work in the Secure Inter-Domain Routing Working Group.

  "Transitive BGP Graceful Restart", Haifeng Zhang, Alvaro Retana,
  25-Mar-13, <draft-zhang-idr-transitive-gr-02.txt>

    This document defines an extension to BGP Graceful Restart that
       reduces the negative impact of multiple inter-connected routers
       restarting.  The proposed mechanism does not require any changes to
       the BGP protocol.

  "Fast Reroute Extensions to Receiver-Driven RSVP-TE for Multicast
  Tunnels", Katherine Zhao, Renwei Li, Christian Jacquenet, 8-Jan-13,
  <draft-zlj-mpls-mrsvp-te-frr-01.txt,.pdf>

    This document specifies fast reroute procedures to protect multicast
       LSP tunnels built by mRSVP-TE, a receiver-driven extension to RSVP-TE
       specified by [I-D.draft-lzj-mpls-receiver-driven-multicast-rsvp-te].
       This document is motivated by the observation that the existing FRR
       solution specified by [RFC4090] and [RFC4875] for the sender-driven
       RSVP-TE is no longer applicable to the receiver-driven RSVP-TE.

  "Multi layer implications in GMPLS controlled networks", Daniele
  Ceccarelli, Francesco Fondelli, Sergio Belotti, Dimitri Papadimitriou,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-bcg-ccamp-gmpls-ml-implications-04.txt>

    This document describes requirements for MRN application to multiple
       hierarchies of technologies (e.g.  OTN, SDH, ETH).  For this purpose,
       after summarizing MRN definitions, rationales and currently supported
       applications, a problem statement is introduced together with its
       implications on GMPLS routing and signaling.  New functional
       requirements are derived and MRN extensions required to address them
       are identified.

  "PPSP Tracker Protocol--Extended Protocol", Rachel Huang, Ning Zong, Rui
  Cruz, Mario Nunes, Joao Taveira, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-huang-ppsp-extended-tracker-protocol-02.txt>

    This document specifies an extended Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol -
    Tracker Protocol, which is a new extension protocol complementing the
    basic core messages and usages specified in the base tracker protocol
    for the exchange of meta information between trackers and peers, such as
    initial offer/request of participation in multimedia content streaming,
    content information, peer lists and reports of activity and status. It
    extends the base tracker protocol to include new optional messages
    providing new usages in the communications between peer and tracker. The
    extension protocol is retro-compatible with the base tracker protocol.

  "Mapping PMIP Quality of Service in WiFi Network", John Kaippallimalil,
  21-Apr-13, <draft-kaippallimalil-netext-pmip-qos-wifi-02.txt>

    This document proposes a model for configuring and mapping PMIP QoS
       parameters of a mobile network session to the corresponding
       connection at a WiFi Access Point. In congested network conditions,
       it is useful for an MN's flows to be policed and shaped at the WLC
       and WiFi AP to match  bandwidth constraints or service priority of
       the user's subscription. Applying similar QoS management at the WiFi
       AP and WLC allows optimal use of network resources. Currently, the
       WiFi AP does not have information on the MNs subscribed bandwidth, or
       relative priority of its flows or services for per user QoS handling
       at the WiFi AP. This document provides a model for mapping PMIP QoS
       to corresponding 802.11e QoS parameters.

  "Securing Model-C Inter-Provider L2 VPNs with Label Hopping and TicToc",
  Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Bhargav Bhikkaji, 8-Apr-13,
  <draft-mjsraman-l2vpn-vpls-tictoc-label-hop-03.txt>

    In certain models of inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label Switching
       (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) spoofing attack against
       VPN sites is a key concern. For example, MPLS-based VPN inter-
       provider model "C" for VPLS, or any L2 VPN purpose is not favoured,
       owing to security concerns in the dataplane, even though it can scale
       with respect to maintenance of routing state. Since the inner labels
       associated with VPN sites are not encrypted during transmission, a
       man-in-the-middle attacker can spoof packets to a specific L2 VPN
       site. In this paper, we propose a label-hopping technique which uses
       a set of randomized labels and a method for hopping amongst these
       labels using the time instant the packet leaves the port from a
       sending Provider Edge Router. To prevent the attacker from
       identifying the labels in polynomial time, we also use an additional
       label. The proposed technique can be applied to other variants of
       inter-provider MPLS based VPNs where Multi-Protocol exterior-BGP (MP-
       eBGP) multi-hop is used. As we address a key security concern, we can
       make a case for the deployment of MPLS based L2 VPN inter-provider
       model "C". Specifically we use the TicToc based Precision Time
       Protocol LSP to provide the timing for determining the time instant
       at which the packet is sent from the remote end Provider Edge Router
       and hence calculating when it must have left that peer at the
       Provider Edge Router in the near / receiving end.
    
       This version of the document suggests a better method for gaining
       more finely granular time slices. This is done by running the PTP LSP
       between the ASBRs in the ASes that are providing the inter-AS L2VPN
       service.

  "Opportunistic Routing based on Users Daily Life Routine", Waldir
  Moreira, Paulo Mendes, Ronedo Ferreira, Douglas Cirqueira, Eduardo
  Cerqueira, 25-Apr-13, <draft-moreira-dlife-02.txt>

    This document is written in the context of the Delay Tolerant
       Networking Research Group and will be presented for reviewing by that
       group. This document defines dLife, an opportunistic routing protocol
       that takes advantage of time-evolving social structures. dLife
       belongs to the family of social-aware opportunistic routing protocols
       for intermittently connected networks. dLife operates based on a
       representation of the dynamics of social structures as a weighted
       contact graph, where the weights (i.e., social strengths) express how
       long a pair of nodes is in contact over different period of times. It
       considers two complementary utility functions: Time-Evolving Contact
       Duration (TECD) that captures the evolution of social interaction
       among pairs of users in the same daily period of time, over
       consecutive days; and TECD Importance (TECDi) that captures the
       evolution of user's importance, based on its node degree and the
       social strength towards its neighbors, in different periods of time.
       It is intended for use in wireless networks where there is no
       guarantee that a fully connected path between any source -
       destination pair exists at any time, a scenario where traditional
       routing protocols are unable to deliver bundles. Such networks can be
       sparse mesh, in which case intermittent connectivity is due to lack
       of physical connections, or dense mesh, in which case intermittent
       connectivity may be due to high interference or shadowing. In any
       case, intermittent connectivity can also be due to the availability
       of devices (e.g., unavailable due to power saving rules). The
       document presents an architectural overview followed by the protocol
       specification.

  "ALTO Extensions for Collecting Data Center Resource Information", Young
  Lee, Greg Bernstein, Dhruv Dhody, 9-Jan-13,
  <draft-lee-alto-ext-dc-resource-01.txt>

    In a networked application environment where resources (e.g.,
       computing, storage, etc.) are geographically distributed in Data
       Centers, a key decision is to allocate the application request to an
       "optimal" Data Center location in which to host the application
       request. Key constraints in this decision include resource
       availability, network cost, infrastructure constraints (e.g., power)
       and others. This draft proposes an ALTO extension to support data
       center resource information model and its related protocol
       extensions.

  "Aware Spanning Tree Topology Change on RBridges", Li Yizhou, Hao
  Weiguo, Jon Hudson, Naveen Nimmu, Anoop Ghanwani, 2-May-13,
  <draft-yizhou-trill-tc-awareness-02.txt>

    When a local LAN running spanning tree protocol connecting to TRILL
       campus via more than one RBridge, there are several ways to perform
       loop avoidance. One of them illustrated by RFC6325 [RFC6325] A.3 was
       to make relevant ports on edge RBridges involving in spanning tree
       calculation. When edge RBridges are emulated as a single highest
       priority root, the local bridged LAN will be naturally partitioned
       after running spanning tree protocol. This approach achieves better
       link utilization and intra-VLAN load balancing in some scenarios.
       This document describes how the edge RBridges react to topology
       change occurring in bridged LAN in order to make the abovementioned
       spanning tree approach function correct.

  "Path Computation Element (PCE) Protocol Extension for Stateful PCE
  Usage in GMPLS Networks", Xian Zhang, Young Lee, Fatai Zhang, Ramon
  Casellas, Oscar de Dios, 21-Feb-13,
  <draft-zhang-pce-pcep-stateful-pce-gmpls-02.txt>

    The Path Computation Element (PCE) facilitates Traffic Engineering
       (TE) based path calculation in large, multi-domain, multi-region, or
       multi-layer networks. [Stateful-PCE] provides the fundamental PCEP
       extensions needed to support stateful PCE functions, without
       specifying the technology-specific extensions. This memo provides
       extensions required for PCE communication protocol (PCEP) so as to
       enable the usage of a stateful PCE capability in GMPLS networks.

  "PCEP extension for multi-fiber existing in inter-domain link", Jie
  Zhang, Jingjing Wang, Yongli Zhao, Shanguo Huang, Yun Bai, Zhihong Wang,
  Xuping Cao, 9-Jan-13, <draft-zhangj-pce-multi-fiber-inter-domain-01.txt>

    Currently, most route computing algorithms only compute a shortest or
       an optimal path.The results of this computation just refer to link
       level, without consideration of fibers.  But, in real networks, the
       link between two adjacent nodes always has multi-fibers.  This
       condition above happens more frequently especially for the gateway
       nodes in the multi-domain network.  Moreover, the number of links
       between two adjacent domains is always more than one.  From the view
       of parent PCE, the two conditions above will be regarded as the
       problem of multi-fibers between adjacent nodes.  However, most route
       computing algorithms always can not solve the problem of multi-fiber
       between adjacent nodes.  As a result, parent PCE can not compute the
       route sequence with specific fibers.  It brings distress and problems
       when parent PCE computing the loose route sequence.
    
       In order to solve the problems existing in real networks, an
       efficient solution will be proposed for parent PCE facing the multi-
       fiber between adjacent nodes.  Some interface and structure will be
       expanded in this proposal.

  "Requirements for Supporting P2MP in Flexi-Grid Networks", Yongli Zhao,
  Xiaosong Yu, Jie Zhang, Jiayu Wang, Xuefeng Lin, 8-Jan-13,
  <draft-zhaoyl-ccamp-p2mp-requirement-flexi-grid-01.txt>

    Multicasting over WDM optical networks has enabled many popular
       Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) applications, such as video conference,
       interactive distance learning, replicated database, distributed
       computing, and so on.  However, on the one hand, the low-rate
       multicasting traffic demands cannot make full use of the capacity of
       the entire wavelength, and on the other hand, new services such as
       data center migration and cloud applications need higher transmission
       rates and higher spectrum efficiency.  Flexi-grid network is an
       effective solution to address the problem of transmission rate and
       spectrum utilization.  It overcomes the fixed grid constraint of
       Wavelength Swithched Optical Network (WSON) by using advanced
       technologies such as coherent detection and Bandwidth Variable-
       Wavelength Selective Switches (BV-WSS).  Therefore, it is essential
       to exploit multicasting over flexi-grid networks.  This document
       covers the requirements for supporting P2MP over flexi-grid
       infrastructure.  Specifically, the scope of requirements listed in
       this document covers the functionality that should be supported by
       the control plane.

  Don Fedyk, Ali Sajassi, 22-Feb-13, <draft-allan-l2vpn-spbm-evpn-03.txt>

    This document describes how Ethernet Shortest Path Bridging MAC mode
       (802.1aq) and (802.1Qbp) can be combined with EVPN in a way that
       interworks with PBB-PEs as described in the PBB-EVPN solution in a
       way that permits operational isolation of each Ethernet network
       subtending an EVPN core while supporting full interworking between
       the 3 variations of Ethernet operation.

  "Automatic Key and Adjacency Management for Routing Protocols", 
  william.atwood@concordia.ca, Revathi Somanatha, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-atwood-karp-akam-rp-03.txt>

    When tightening the security of the core routing infrastructure, two
       steps are necessary.  The first is to secure the routing protocols'
       packets on the wire.  The second is to ensure that the keying
       material for the routing protocol exchanges is distributed only to
       the appropriate routers.  This document specifies requirements on
       that distribution and proposes the use of a set of protocols to
       achieve those requirements.

  Daniele Ceccarelli, Fatai Zhang, Yuji Tochio, 6-Jun-13,
  <draft-belotti-app-statement-l1vpn-em-02.txt>

    This document provides an applicability statement on the use of
      Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and
      mechanisms to satisfy the requirements of the Layer 1 Virtual
      Private Network (L1VPN) Enhanced Mode.
    
      L1VPNs provide customer services and connectivity at layer 1 over
      layer 1 networks. The operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic
      Mode and the Enhanced Mode, where the Enhanced Mode of operation may
      also include exchange of routing information between the layer 1
      network and the customer domain.

  "Network Performance Isolation in Data Centres using Congestion
  Policing", Bob Briscoe, Murari Sridharan, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-briscoe-conex-data-centre-01.txt>

    This document describes how a multi-tenant (or multi-department) data
       centre operator can isolate tenants from network performance
       degradation due to each other's usage, but without losing the
       multiplexing benefits of a LAN-style network where anyone can use any
       amount of any resource.  Zero per-tenant configuration and no
       implementation change is required on network equipment.  Instead the
       solution is implemented with a simple change to the hypervisor (or
       container) beneath the tenant's virtual machines on every physical
       server connected to the network.  These collectively enforce a very
       simple distributed contract - a single network allowance that each
       tenant can allocate among their virtual machines, even if distributed
       around the network.  The solution uses layer-3 switches that support
       explicit congestion notification (ECN).  It is best if the sending
       operating system supports congestion exposure (ConEx).  Nonetheless,
       the operator can unilaterally deploy a complete solution while
       operating systems are being incrementally upgraded to support ConEx
       and ECN.

  "LISP Single-Hop DHT Mapping Overlay", Li Cheng, Jun Wang, 21-Feb-13,
  <draft-cheng-lisp-shdht-03.txt>

    This draft specifies the LISP Single-Hop Distributed Hash Table
       Mapping Overlay (LISP-SHDHT), a distributed mapping database which
       embodies SHDHT Nodes to maintain (Key, value) pairs for LISP
       (Locator/ID Separation Protocol)-like architecture, wherein every
       (key value) pair corresponds to an EID(Endpoint ID)-to-RLOC(Routing
       Locator) mapping information entry.  According to this strategy, EID
       is hashed to be a unique Resource ID which is used for locating
       destination DHT Node who maintains mapping entry for the particular
       EID.  Furthermore, adaptive hash space partition method is adopted to
       solve the load balance problem on SHDHT Nodes which is common on
       traditional DHT planes.

  "Tail Loss Probe (TLP): An Algorithm for Fast Recovery of Tail Losses",
  Nandita Dukkipati, Neal Cardwell, Yuchung Cheng, Matt Mathis, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-dukkipati-tcpm-tcp-loss-probe-01.txt>

    Retransmission timeouts are detrimental to application latency,
       especially for short transfers such as Web transactions where
       timeouts can often take longer than all of the rest of a transaction.
       The primary cause of retransmission timeouts are lost segments at the
       tail of transactions.  This document describes an experimental
       algorithm for TCP to quickly recover lost segments at the end of
       transactions or when an entire window of data or acknowledgments are
       lost.  Tail Loss Probe (TLP) is a sender-only algorithm that allows
       the transport to recover tail losses through fast recovery as opposed
       to lengthy retransmission timeouts.  If a connection is not receiving
       any acknowledgments for a certain period of time, TLP transmits the
       last unacknowledged segment (loss probe).  In the event of a tail
       loss in the original transmissions, the acknowledgment from the loss
       probe triggers SACK/FACK based fast recovery.  TLP effectively avoids
       long timeouts and thereby improves TCP performance.

  "Management of Networks with Constrained Devices: Problem Statement, Use
  Cases and Requirements", Mehmet Ersue, Dan Romascanu, Juergen

  "Requirements for IP/MPLS network transmission interruption duration",
  Peng Fan, Lianyuan Li, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-fan-opsawg-transmission-interruption-02.txt>

    The transmission performance of IP/MPLS network affects upper layer
       services and networks, but there is no consensus in the industry on
       transmission interruption for IP/MPLS network up to now.  This memo
       studies requirements for the interruption duration criteria in
       several service scenarios.

  "LISP Control-Plane Multicast Signaling", Dino Farinacci, Maria
  Napierala, 7-Jan-13, <draft-farinacci-lisp-mr-signaling-01.txt>

    This document describes an alternate method to signal multicast tree
       building among xTRs in multicast capable LISP sites.  This approach
       avoids the need to run a multicast routing protocol on the LISP
       overlay.

  "Shared Memory Communications over RDMA", Mike Fox, Constantinos
  Kassimis, Jerry Stevens, 31-May-13,
  <draft-fox-tcpm-shared-memory-rdma-02.txt>

    This document describes the Shared Memory Communications over RDMA
       (SMC-R) protocol.  This protocol provides RDMA communications to TCP
       endpoints in a manner that is transparent to socket applications.  It
       further provides for dynamic discovery of partner RDMA capabilities
       and dynamic setup of RDMA connections, transparent high availability
       and load balancing when redundant RDMA network paths are available,
       and it maintains many of the traditional TCP/IP qualities of service
       such as filtering that enterprise users demand, as well as TCP socket
       semantics such as urgent data.

  "Framework for Point-to-Multipoint MPLS-TP OAM", Yoshinori Koike,
  Takafumi Hamano, Masatoshi Namiki, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-hmk-mpls-tp-p2mp-oam-framework-02.txt>

    The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized to enable
       carrier-grade packet transport.
    
       This document discusses and specifies the P2MP framework primarily
       related to OAM and related management in MPLS-TP networks. This
       document mainly refers to RFC5654 and RFC6371. The main focus is on
       the details that are not covered or not clarified in relevant RFCs
       such as RFC5654, RFC5860, RFC5921, RFC5951, RFC6371, and draft-mpls-
       tp-p2mp-framework.
    
       Note: This I-D was made and updated including the discussions in ITU-
       T SG15, which were described in Liaison Statements such as
       (https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1235/)
    
       This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
       (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
       Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
       Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
       capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

  "RADIUS Extensions for IPv4-Embedded Multicast and Unicast IPv6
  Prefixes", Qian Wang, Wei Meng, Cui Wang, Mohamed Boucadair, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-hu-softwire-multicast-radius-ext-03.txt>

    This document specifies a new Remote Authentication Dial-In User
       Service (RADIUS) attribute to carry the Multicast-Prefixes-64
       information, aiming to delivery the Multicast and Unicast IPv6
       Prefixes to be used to build multicast and unicast IPv4-Embedded IPv6
       addresses. this RADIUS attribute is defined based on the equivalent
       DHCPv6 OPTION_PREFIX64 option.

  "HIP Middlebox Puzzle Offloading and End-host Notification", Rene
  Hummen, Martin Henze, Jens Hiller, 9-Jan-13,
  <draft-hummen-hip-middle-puzzle-01.txt>

    The Host Identity Protocol [RFC5201] is a secure signaling protocol
       with a cryptographic namespace.  It provides the communicating peers
       with a cryptographic puzzle mechanism to protect against Denial of
       Service (DoS) attacks exploiting the computation and memory overheads
       of the protocol exchange.  This document specifies an extension of
       the protocol that enables an on-path network entity to assist in the
       choice of the puzzle difficulty in case of an attack.  Furthermore,
       it defines a modification of the puzzle mechanism that enables a host
       to delegate puzzle solving to an on-path network entity.

  "LSP-Ping Mechanisms for E-VPN and PBB-EVPN", Parag Jain, Sami Boutros,
  Samer Salam, 19-Feb-13, <draft-jain-l2vpn-evpn-lsp-ping-01.txt>

    LSP-Ping is a widely deployed Operation, Administration, and
       Maintenance (OAM) mechanism in MPLS networks. This document
       describes mechanisms for detecting data-plane failures using LSP
       Ping in MPLS based E-VPN and PBB-EVPN networks.

  "A Framework for Semantic IPv6 Prefix", Sheng Jiang, Qiong Sun, Ian
  Farrer, Yang Bo, 27-May-13, <draft-jiang-semantic-prefix-05.txt>

    This document describes a framework method that network operations
       may use their addresses.  Network operators, who have large IPv6
       address space, may choose to embedded some semantics into IPv6
       addresses by assigning additional significance to specific bits
       within the prefix.  By embedded semantics into IPv6 prefixes, the
       semantics of packets can be inspected easily.  Routers and other
       intermediary devices can easily apply relevant policies as required.
       Packet-level differentiation can also enable flow-level and user-
       level differentiation.  Consequently, the network operators can
       accordingly treat network packets differently and efficiently.  The
       management and maintenance of networks can be much simpler.

  "RADIUS Attribute for 4rd", Sheng Jiang, Yu Fu, Bing Liu, 20-Feb-13,
  <draft-jiang-softwire-4rd-radius-02.txt>

    IPv4 Residual Deployment via IPv6 (4rd) is a stateless mechanism for
       running IPv4 over IPv6-only infrastructure. It provides both IPv4 and
       IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-
       existing period. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
       (DHCPv6) 4rd options has been defined to configure 4rd Customer Edge
       (CE). However, in many networks, the configuration information may be
       stored in Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers
       while user configuration is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway
       (BNG) through DHCPv6 protocol. This document defines a Remote
       Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries
       4rd configuration information from AAA server to BNG. The 4rd RADIUS
       attribute are designed following the simplify principle. It provides
       just enough information to form the correspondent DHCPv6 4rd option.

  "JSON Web Encryption JSON Serialization (JWE-JS)", Michael Jones,
  28-Dec-12, <draft-jones-jose-jwe-json-serialization-04.txt,.pdf>

    The JSON Web Encryption JSON Serialization (JWE-JS) is a means of
       representing encrypted content using JavaScript Object Notation
       (JSON) data structures.  This specification describes a means of
       representing secured content as a JSON data object (as opposed to the
       JWE specification, which uses a compact serialization with a URL-safe
       representation).  It enables the same content to be encrypted to
       multiple parties (unlike JWE).  Cryptographic algorithms and
       identifiers used with this specification are described in the
       separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) specification.  The JSON
       Serialization for related digital signature and MAC functionality is
       described in the separate JSON Web Signature JSON Serialization
       (JWS-JS) specification.

  "JSON Web Signature JSON Serialization (JWS-JS)", Michael Jones, John
  Bradley, Nat Sakimura, 28-Dec-12,
  <draft-jones-jose-jws-json-serialization-04.txt,.pdf>

    The JSON Web Signature JSON Serialization (JWS-JS) is a means of
       representing content secured with digital signatures or Message
       Authentication Codes (MACs) using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
       data structures.  This specification describes a means of
       representing secured content as a JSON data object (as opposed to the
       JWS specification, which uses a compact serialization with a URL-safe
       representation).  It enables multiple digital signatures and/or MACs
       to be applied to the same content (unlike JWS).  Cryptographic
       algorithms and identifiers used with this specification are described
       in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) specification.  The JSON

  "<Performance Issues with MPTCP>", Ramin Khalili, Nicolas Gast, Miroslav
  Popovic, Jean-Yves Le Boudec, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-khalili-mptcp-performance-issues-02.txt>

    We show, by measurements over a testbed and by mathematical analysis,
       that the current MPTCP suffers from two problems: (P1) Upgrading some
       TCP users to MPTCP can reduce the throughput of others without any
       benefit to the upgraded users; and (P2) MPTCP users can be
       excessively aggressive towards TCP users. We attribute these problems
       to the "Linked Increases" Algorithm (LIA) of MPTCP [4], and more
       specifically, to an excessive amount of traffic transmitted over
       congested paths. Our results show that these problems are important
       and can be mitigated. We believe that the design of the congestion
       control of MPTCP should be improved.

  "Object Naming Framework for the Future Internet", Imran Khan, Gyu Lee,
  Noel Crespi, 27-Feb-13, <draft-khan-object-naming-02.txt>

    This document explains the concept of object to object communications
    and describes object identification for the Future Internet. In order
    to develop protocols for object to object communications, this
    document provides the naming architecture according to mapping
    relationships between host and object(s). In addition, considerations
    of protocols for naming object are specified.

  "Third-Party ALTO Server Discovery (3pdisc)", Sebastian Kiesel, Kilian
  Krause, Martin Stiemerling, 16-May-13, <draft-kist-alto-3pdisc-03.txt>

    The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
       provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several
       hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired
       resource.  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an
       ALTO client can ask for guidance it needs to discover one or more
       ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance.
    
       This document specifies a procedure for third-party ALTO server
       discovery, which can be used if the ALTO client is not co-located
       with the actual resource consumer, but instead embedded in a third
       party such as a peer-to-peer tracker.
    
       Technically, the algorithm specified in this document takes one
       IP address and a U-NAPTR Service Parameter (i.e., "ALTO:http" or
       "ALTO:https") as parameters.  It performs several DNS lookups (for
       PTR, SOA, and U-NAPTR resource records) and returns one or more
       URI(s) of information resources related to that IP address.

  "Using BGP for routing in large-scale data centers", Petr Lapukhov,
  Ariff Premji, 7-Apr-13, <draft-lapukhov-bgp-routing-large-dc-04.txt>

    Some service providers build and operate data centers that support
       over 100,000 servers.  In this document, such data centers are
       referred to as "large-scale" to differentiate them from smaller
       infrastructures.  The environments of this scale have a unique set of
       network requirements, with emphasis on operational simplicity and
       network stability.
    
       This document summarizes ideas and experience of many people involved
       in designing and operating large scale data centers using BGP as the
       only control-plane protocol.  The intent here is to report a proven
       and stable routing design that could be leveraged by others in the
       industry.

  "ALTO Extensions to Support Application and Network Resource Information
  Exchange for High Bandwidth Applications", Young Lee, Greg Bernstein,
  Taesang Choi, Sreekanth Madhavan, Dhruv Dhody, 8-Jan-13,
  <draft-lee-alto-app-net-info-exchange-01.txt>

    This draft proposes ALTO information model and protocol extensions to
    support application and network resource information exchange for high
    bandwidth applications in partially controlled and controlled
    environments as part of the infrastructure to application information
    exposure (i2aex) initiative.

  "DHCPv6/SLAAC Address Configuration Switching for Host Renumbering",
  Bing Liu, Wendong Wang, Xiangyang Gong, 14-Jan-13,
  <draft-liu-6renum-dhcpv6-slaac-switching-02.txt>

    Sometimes stateful DHCPv6 address configuration and SLAAC may be both
       available in one network. In ND protocol, there is a "M" (ManagedFlag)
       flag defined in RA message, which indicates the hosts the DHCPv6
       service is available. But for some reason, the ND protocol didn't
       define the flag as prescriptive but only advisory. This draft
       proposes to use two reserved bits in RA message to let the network
       control the hosts that which address configuration mode should be
       used. This feature is useful for management, especially in a
       renumbering event.

  "Transparent SDH/SONET over Packet", Gert Manhoudt, Stephan Roullot, Kin
  Wong, 8-Feb-13, <draft-manhoudt-pwe3-tsop-02.txt>

    This document describes the Transparent SDH/SONET over Packet (TSoP)
       mechanism to encapsulate Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) or
       Synchronous Optical NETwork (SONET) bit-streams in a packet format,
       suitable for Pseudowire (PW) transport over a packet switched network
       (PSN).  The key property of the TSoP  method is that it transports
       the SDH/SONET client signal in its entirety through the PW, i.e., no
       use is made of any specific characteristic of the SONET/SDH signal
       format, other than its bit rate.  The TSoP transparency includes
       transporting the timing properties of the SDH/SONET client signal.
       This ensures a maximum of transparency and a minimum of complexity,
       both in implementation and during operation.

  "Software Defined Networks Use Case for Virtual Connection and Network
  on Demand", Mach Chen, Mike McBride, Liang Ou, 15-Jan-13,
  <draft-mm-sdn-vc-vn-on-demand-use-case-02.txt>

    Software Defined Networks (SDN) provide a way to virtualize and
       abstract the network and presents the virtual/abstract resources to
       the third-party applications/software.  The applications/software
       can, by the programmable interface or Northbound API, request,
       manipulate and monitor the services that the network provided.  With
       this SDN capability, more innovative services can be introduced and
       rapidly deployed.  Additionally, existing services can be deployed
       and managed in a much more simple way.
    
       This document outlines two use cases that leverage the SDN
       architecture/model to implement a kind of "self-help" and automated
       set of network services: Virtual Connection on Demand (VCoD) and
       Virtual Network on Demand (VNoD).

  "Congestion control algorithm for lower latency and lower loss media
  transport", Piers O'Hanlon, Ken Carlberg, 24-Apr-13,
  <draft-ohanlon-rmcat-dflow-02.txt>

    This memo provides a design for a congestion control algorithm, for
       media transport, which aims to provide for lower delay and lower loss
       communications.

  "Extensions to OSPF facilitating the deployment of non-backward-
  compatible changes.", Mike Dubrovsky, Rashmi Shrivastava, Dean Cheng,
  16-Feb-13, <draft-ospf-non-compatible-01.txt>

    This document specifies a generic mechanism that facilitates the
       deployment of non-backward-compatible changes in OSPF protocol.  This
       mechanism allows the OSPF routers to advertise the capability of non-
       backward-compatible functionality and to make the functionality
       operational only when supported by all participating routers.
       Depending on the functionality scope, capability advertisements must
       be propagated across a link, area or autonomous system (AS).  For
       link and area scope functionality, Router Information Link State
       Advertisement (LSA) is utilized to propagate the capability
       information.  For the cases when compatibility must be maintained
       across the whole OSPF autonomous system, new Area Information (AI)
       LSA is introduced.  The AI LSA is a TLV-based analog of Indication-
       LSA that is used for demand circuit functionality and described in
       RFC1793.

  "Turning off IPv4 Using DHCPv6", Simon Perreault, Wesley George, Tina
  Tsou, Tianle Yang, 11-Mar-13, <draft-perreault-sunset4-noipv4-02.txt>

    This memo defines a new DHCPv6 option for indicating to a dual-stack
       host or router that IPv4 is to be turned off.

  "Scenarios and Requirements for IP in Intelligent Transportation
  Systems", Alexandru Petrescu, Christophe Janneteau, Michael Boc, Witold
  Klaudel, 26-Mar-13, <draft-petrescu-its-scenarios-reqs-02.txt>

    This draft describes scenarios of vehicular communications that are
       considered pertinent to Intelligent Transportation Systems.  In these
       scenarios, the necessity of using IP networking technologies and
       protocols is exposed.

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Recording Call Flows", Ram R,
  Parthasarathi Ravindran, Paul Kyzivat, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ram-siprec-callflows-03.txt>

    Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
       environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
       these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
       compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
       is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
       recording device.  This document lists call flows that has snapshot
       of metadata sent from SRC to SRS, the metadata format for which is
       described in [I-D.ietf-siprec-metadata] .  This is purely an
       informational document that is written to support the model defined
       in the metadata draft.

  "A Framework and Requirements for Energy Aware Control Planes", Alvaro
  Retana, Russ White, Manuel Paul, 13-Feb-13,
  <draft-retana-rtgwg-eacp-01.txt>

    There has been, for several years, a rising concern over the energy
       usage of large scale networks.  This concern is strongly focused on
       campus, data center, and other highly concentrated deployments of
       network infrastructure.  Given the steadily increasing demand for
       higher network speeds, always-on service models, and ubiquitous
       network coverage, it is also of growing importance for
       telecommunication networks both local and wide area in scope.  One of
       the issues in moving forward to reduce energy usage is to ensure that
       the network can still meet the performance specifications required to
       support the applications running over it.
    
       This document provides an overview of the various areas of concern in
       the interaction between network performance and efforts at energy
       aware control planes, as a guide for those working on modifying
       current control planes or designing new control planes to improve the
       energy efficiency of high density, highly complex, network
       deployments.

  "An Acceptable Use Policy for New ICMP Types and Codes", Melinda Shore,
  Carlos Pignataro, 26-Mar-13, <draft-shore-icmp-aup-03.txt>

    Concerns about lack of clarity concerning when to add new Internet
       Control Message Protocol (ICMP) types and/or codes have highlighted a
       need to describe policies for when adding new features to ICMP is
       desirable and when it is not.  In this document we provide a basic
       description of ICMP's role in the IP stack and some guidelines for
       the future.

  "Multipath RTP (MPRTP) attribute in Session Description Protocol", Varun
  Singh, Joerg Ott, Teemu Karkkainen, Ralf Globisch, Thomas Schierl,
  10-Jan-13, <draft-singh-mmusic-mprtp-sdp-extension-01.txt>

    Multipath RTP (MPRTP) is an extension to the Real-time Transport
       Protocol (RTP) that allows multi-homed endpoints to take advantage of
       the availability of multiple Internet paths between endpoints to
       send/receive media packets.  This document describes how to express
       the interface advertisement and negotiation during session setup in
       SDP (Session Description Protocol).

  "Multicasting Applications Across Inter-Domain Peering Points", Percy
  Tarapore, Robert Sayko, ramki, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-tarapore-mboned-multicast-cdni-02.txt>

    This document examines the process of transporting applications via
       multicast across inter-domain peering points. The objective is to
       describe the setup process for multicast-based delivery across
       administrative domains and document supporting functionality to
       enable this process.

  "The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Holder-of-the-Key Token Usage",
  John Bradley, Phil Hunt, Anthony Nadalin, Hannes Tschofenig, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-tschofenig-oauth-hotk-02.txt>

    OAuth 2.0 deployments currently rely on bearer tokens for securing
       access to protected resources.  Bearer tokens require Transport Layer
       Security to be used between an OAuth client and the resource server
       when presenting the access token.  The security model is based on
       proof-of-possession: access token storage and transfer has to be done
       with care to prevent leakage.
    
       There are, however, use cases that require a more active involvement
       of the OAuth client for an increased level of security, particularly
       to secure against token leakage.  This document specifies an OAuth
       security framework using the holder-of-the-key concept, which
       requires the OAuth client when presenting an OAuth access token to
       also demonstrate knowledge of keying material that is bound to the
       token.

  "Analysis of Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) Use
  Cases", David Waltermire, Adam Montville, 10-Feb-13,
  <draft-waltermire-sacm-use-cases-04.txt>

    This document identifies use cases, derived functional capabilities,
       and requirements needed to provide a foundation for creating
       interoperable automation tools and continuous monitoring solutions
       that provide visibility into the state of endpoints, user activities,
       and network behavior.  Stakeholders will be able to use these tools
       to aggregate and analyze relevant security and operational data to
       understand the organizations security posture, quantify business
       risk, and make informed decisions that support organizational
       objectives while protecting critical information.  Organizations will
       be able to use these tools to augment and automate information
       sharing activities to collaborate with partners to identify and
       mitigate threats.  Other automation tools will be able to integrate
       with these capabilities to enforce policies based on human decisions
       to harden systems, prevent misuse and reduce the overall attack
       surface.

  "Filtering of Overlapping Routes", Russ White, Alvaro Retana, Susan
  Hares, 25-Feb-13, <draft-white-grow-overlapping-routes-01.txt>

    This document proposes a mechanism to remove a prefix when it
       overlaps with a functionally equivalent shorter prefix.  The proposed
       mechanism does not require any changes to the BGP protocol.

  "Mobility with ICE (MICE)", Dan Wing, Prashanth Patil, Tirumaleswar
  Reddy, Paal-Erik Martinsen, 16-Jan-13,
  <draft-wing-mmusic-ice-mobility-03.txt>

    This specification describes how endpoint mobility can be achieved
       using ICE.  Two mechanisms are shown, one where both endpoints
       support ICE and another where only one endpoint supports ICE.

  "MAP Interoperability Testing Results", Xing Li, Congxiao Bao, Guoliang
  Han, Wojciech Dec, 3-Jan-13, <draft-xli-softwire-map-testing-01.txt>

    This document presents the testing results of a unified code
       accommodating encapsulation and translation modes of Mapping of
       Address and Port (MAP).  Experiments show that the unified MAP CE is
       not only supporting MAP-E and MAP-T modes, but also backward
       compatible with AFTR of dual-stack lite and stateless/stateful NAT64.

  "ICMP Extensions for Virtual Network", Derek Yeung, 21-Feb-13,
  <draft-yeung-icmp-vnet-01.txt>

    This document specifies the extensions to ICMP that allow virtual
       network information to be included in an ICMP packet.  These
       extensions can be used to facilitate troubleshooting network problems
       within a virtual network or across multiple virtual networks.

  "Power-aware Routing and Traffic Engineering: Requirements, Approaches,
  and Issues", Beichuan Zhang, Junxiao Shi, Jie Dong, Mingui Zhang,
  10-Jan-13, <draft-zhang-greennet-01.txt>

    Energy consumption of network infrastructures is rising fast.  There
       are emerging needs for power-aware routing and traffic engineering,
       which adjust routing paths to help reduce power consumption network-
       wide.  This document gives a high-level analysis on the basic
       requirements, approaches, and potential issues in power-aware routing
       and traffic engineering.

  "Signaling Virtual Machine Activity to the Network Virtualization Edge",
  Kireeti Kompella, Yakov Rekhter, Thomas Morin, David Black, 29-Apr-13,
  <draft-kompella-nvo3-server2nve-02.txt>

    This document proposes a simplified approach for provisioning network
    parameters related to Virtual Machine creation, migration and
    termination on servers.  The idea is to provision the server, then
    have the server signal the requisite parameters to the relevant
    network device(s).  Such an approach reduces the workload on the
    provisioning system and simplifies the data model that the
    provisioning system needs to maintain.  It is also more resilient to
    topology changes in server-network connectivity, for example,
    reconnecting a server to a different network port or switch.

  "MPLS PIM Inter-working", Bisong Tao, 13-Mar-13,
  <draft-tao-mpls-pim-interworking-01.txt>

    This document describes a framework for the inter-working between
       Protocol Independent Multicast [PIM] and a leaf-driven P2MP tunnel
       signaling protocol so that multiple PIM sites around an MPLS network
       can form a single PIM domain without compromising PIM's features,
       scalability, and performance.

  "File Transfer Protocol HOST Command for Virtual Hosts", Paul Hethmon,
  Robert McMurray, 16-May-13,
  <draft-hethmon-mcmurray-ftpext-ftp-hosts-02.txt>

    The File Transfer Protocol, as defined in RFC 959, does not provide a
    way for FTP clients and servers to differentiate between multiple DNS
    names that are registered for a single IP address.  This document
    defines a new FTP command that provides a mechanism for FTP clients
    and servers to identify individual virtual hosts on an FTP server.

  "Management Information Base for Virtual Machines Controlled by a
  Hypervisor", Hirochika Asai, Michael MacFaden, Juergen Schoenwaelder,
  Yuji Sekiya, Keiichi Shima, Tina Tsou, Cathy Zhou, Hiroshi Esaki,
  10-Apr-13, <draft-asai-vmm-mib-03.txt>

    This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
       (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
       community.  In particular, this specifies objects for managing
       virtual machines controlled by a hypervisor (a.k.a. virtual machine
       manager).

  "Stateful Observation in CoAP", Changsha Ma, Peilin Hong, Kaiping Xue,
  29-Dec-12, <draft-ma-core-stateful-observe-01.txt,.pdf>

    The Observe Option allows a CoAP client to observe changes in the
       state of resources and obtain a current representation of the last
       resource state.  To be an observer of an origin server's resources,
       the client is required to register its interest with the server.  A
       successful registration will make the client added into the server's
       observation list, while a failed one may drive the client to re-
       register.
    
       However, repeated and frequent re-registrations cannot guarantee the
       client to eventually become an observer of the target server.  In the
       case that the server is unable or unwilling to accept an observer,
       the time-intensive re-registrations will just bring redundant
       messages in the constrained network and considerable energy
       consumption on both the client and the server.
    
       This memo defines a new CoAP option, State, for providing stateful
       observation on the resources of CoAP servers.  By observing the state
       of the server in terms of the Observe Option, a client can explicitly
       learn when the server will not actively reject an observation
       registration, and then can wisely performs the re-registration.  This
       avoids the potential registration flooding that causes considerable
       network overhead and energy consumption on the constrained nodes.

  "Label-based Provider-Provisioned Lawful Intercept for L2 VPNs", Shankar
  Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Bhargav Bhikkaji, 25-Jan-13,
  <draft-balaji-l2vpn-lawful-intercept-thru-label-dis-01.txt>

    In models of Single-AS and inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label
       Switching (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) Lawful
       Intercept is a key requirement. For example, MPLS-based Layer 2 VPN
       models like VPLS and the like do not have any provider provisioned
       methods of lawful intercept that are comprehensive, quick and easy to
       provision from one single point. More particularly the auto-
       provisioning of lawful intercept for all sets of streams travelling
       between VPN sites and consequent re-direction of these streams to the
       appropriate government network has not been covered without multiple
       instances of having to configure the intercept at various points in
       the network both in the Single-AS case and the Inter-Provider VPN
       case.
    
       this paper, we propose a technique which uses a set of pre-defined
       labels called Lawful Intercept labels and a method for provisioning
       lawful intercept amongst the various PE devices using these labels
       both in the Single-AS and the inter-provider VPN cases. A single
       point of configuration is the key to this idea. The intercepted
       traffic is mirrored on a PE or a whole set of PEs or on all the PEs
       participating in the VPN. A technique called the Domino-effect
       provisioning of these Label-based Provider Provisioned Lawful
       Intercept mechanism is also outlined.

  "KARP KMP: Simplified Peer Authentication", Uma Chunduri, Albert Tian,
  Ari Keranen, Tero Kivinen, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-chunduri-karp-kmp-router-fingerprints-03.txt>

    This document describes the usage of Router Fingerprint
       Authentication (RFA) with public keys as a potential peer
       authentication method with KARP pair wise and group Key Management
       Protocols (KMPs).  The advantage of RFA is, it neither requires out-
       of-band, mutually agreeable symmetric keys nor a full PKI based
       system (trust anchor or CA certificates) for mutual authentication of
       peers with KARP KMP deployments.  Usage of Router Fingerprints give a
       significant operational improvement from symmetric key based systems
       and yet provide a secure authentication technique.

  "Loop Detection Mechanisms for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
  Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs)", Hadriel Kaplan, Victor Pascual,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-kaplan-straw-b2bua-loop-detection-01.txt>

    SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) can cause unending SIP request
       routing loops because, as User Agent Clients, they can generate SIP
       requests with new Max-Forwards values.  This document discusses the
       difficulties associated with loop detection for B2BUAs, and
       requirements for them to prevent infinite loops.

  "A Media-based Traceroute Function for the Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP)", Hadriel Kaplan, 15-Jun-13,
  <draft-kaplan-straw-sip-traceroute-01.txt>

    SIP already provides the ability to perform hop-by-hop traceroute
       for SIP messages using the Max-Forwards header field, in order to
       determine the reachability path of requests to a target.  A
       mechanism for media-loopback calls has also been defined separately,
       which enables test calls to be generated which result in media being
       looped back to the originator.  This document describes a means of
       performing hop-by-hop traceroute-style test calls using the media-
       loopback mechanism, in order to test the media path when SIP
       sessions go through media-relaying B2BUAs.

  "Best practices and Requirements for delivering Long Tail personalized
  content delivery over CDN Interconnections", ramki, Mian Li, Bhumip
  Khasnabish, Ge Chen, 29-May-13, <draft-krishnan-cdni-long-tail-05.txt>

    The content desire of users is evolving from most popular to long
       tail personalized content. This document discusses the best
       practices and requirements for delivering long tail personalized
       content in CDN Interconnection scenarios.

  "RTCWeb JSEP XMPP/Jingle Mapping", Kepeng Li, 28-Jan-13,
  <draft-li-rtcweb-jsep-xmpp-mapping-02.txt>

    This document proposes mapping message representations between RTCWeb
       Javascript Session Establishment Protocol(JSEP) scheme and XMPP/
       Jingle [XEP-0166] messaging scheme.  Such a signaling mapping is
       intended to enable Javascript to use XMPP/Jingle to establish a
       session between two RTCWeb enabled browsers.

  "Encoding for WSON Information Model with Impairments Validation.",
  Giovanni Martinelli, Moustafa Kattan, Gabriele Galimberti, Andrea
  Zanardi, 23-Feb-13, <draft-martinelli-ccamp-wson-iv-encode-01.txt>

    This document defines proper encoding for the Information Model to
       support Impairment-Aware (IA) Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA)
       function.  This operation might be required in Wavelength Switched
       Optical Networks (WSON) that already support RWA, encoding defined
       here goes in addition to available WSON encoding and it is fully
       compatible with it.
    
       As the information model, the encoding is independent from control
       plane architectures and protocol implementations.  Its definitions
       must be reused in related protocol extensions.

  "Information Model for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON) with
  Optical Impairments Validation.", Giovanni Martinelli, Moustafa Kattan,
  Gabriele Galimberti, Andrea Zanardi, 23-Feb-13,
  <draft-martinelli-ccamp-wson-iv-info-01.txt>

    This document defines the Information Model to support Impairment-
       Aware (IA) Routing an Wavelength Assignment (RWA) function.  This
       operation might be required in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks
       (WSON) that already support RWA and the Information model defined
       here goes in addition and it is fully compatible with the already
       defined information model for WSON.
    
       This information model shall support all control plane architectural
       options defined for WSON with impairment validation.

  "Network Time Protocol: autokey Version 2 Specification", Dieter Sibold,
  Stephen Roettger, 24-Feb-13, <draft-sibold-autokey-02.txt>

    This document describes a security protocol that enables
       authenticated time synchronization using Network Time Protocol (NTP).
       Autokey Version 2 obsoletes NTP autokey protocol RFC 5906 [RFC5906]
       which suffers from various security vulnerabilities.  Its design
       considers the special requirements that are related to the task of
       precise timekeeping.

  "A Larger Loopback Prefix for IPv6", Mark Smith, 20-Feb-13,
  <draft-smith-v6ops-larger-ipv6-loopback-prefix-04.txt>

    During the development and testing of a network application, it can
       be useful to run multiple instances of the application using the same
       transport layer protocol port on the same development host, while
       also having network access to the application instances limited to
       the local host.  Under IPv4, this has commonly been possible by using
       different loopback addresses within 127/8.  It is not possible under
       IPv6, as the loopback prefix of ::1/128 only provides a single
       loopback address.  This memo proposes a new larger loopback prefix
       that will provide many IPv6 loopback addresses.  The processing rules
       for this new larger loopback prefix also allow sending or forwarding
       of packets containing these addresses beyond the originating router
       under certain circumstances.

  "Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs",
  Michelle Cotton, Barry Leiba, Thomas Narten, 29-Mar-13,
  <draft-leiba-cotton-iana-5226bis-02.txt>

    Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants
       to identify various protocol parameters.  To ensure that the values
       used in these fields do not have conflicting uses, and to promote
       interoperability, their allocation is often coordinated by a central
       authority.  For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet
       Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
    
       To manage a given namespace prudently, IANA needs guidance describing
       the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as
       when and how modifications to existing values can be made.  This
       document defines a framework for the documentation of these
       guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the
       guidance given to IANA is clear and addresses the various issues that
       are likely in the operation of a registry.
    
       This is the third edition, and obsoletes RFC 5226.

  "Request For Action to Establish an Enhanced Cooperation Task Force and
  a Preparatory Working-Group", Norbert Bollow, 13-Feb-13,
  <draft-bollow-ectf-06.txt>

    This memo calls for the creation of a new governance forum named
       "Enhanced Cooperation Task Force" (ECTF).  The main purpose of the
       ECTF is to facilitate consensus-seeking discussions regarding
       information society governance actions that will be taken by national
       governments and international organizations.

  "Authenticated Denial of Existence in the DNS", R. Gieben, Matthijs
  Mekking, 7-Jan-13, <draft-gieben-auth-denial-of-existence-dns-02.txt>

    Authenticated denial of existence allows a resolver to validate that
    a certain domain name does not exist.  It is also used to signal that
    a domain name exists, but does not have the specific RR type you were
    asking for.  When returning a negative DNSSEC response, a name server
    usually includes up to two NSEC records.  With NSEC3 this amount is
    three.  This document provides additional background commentary and
    some context for the NSEC and NSEC3 mechanisms used by DNSSEC to
    provide authenticated denial of existence responses

  "ALTO Caching", Sreekanth Madhavan, Nandiraju Ravishankar, 3-Feb-13,
  <draft-madhavan-alto-caching-01.txt>

    The specification of the ALTO protocol uses map based approaches
       assuming that the information provided is static for a longer period
       of time.  The purpose of this memo is to provide a mechanism where
       ALTO clients cache the map information and the servers provide the
       expiration time for invalidation.

  "ALTO Subscription", Sreekanth Madhavan, Nandiraju Ravishankar,
  3-Feb-13, <draft-madhavan-alto-subscription-01.txt>

    The specification of the ALTO protocol uses map based approaches
       assuming that the information provided is static for a longer period
       of time.  But in some cases network operators reallocate IP subnets
       from time to time which in turn changes the mapping partitions[I-
       D.ietf-alto-deployments].  Since the ALTO clients are unaware of the
       map information changes, clients need to query the servers for every
       service request and many such requests are redundant because the
       information was not changed.  The purpose of this memo is to propose
       a mechanism where ALTO clients can subscribe for event notifications
       from the server

  "HTTP/2.0 Discussion: Stored Header Encoding", James Snell, 9-Jun-13,
  <draft-snell-httpbis-bohe-10.txt>

    This memo describes a proposed alternative encoding for headers that
       combines the best concepts from the proposed Delta and HeaderDiff
       options with the typed value codecs introduced by previous versions
       of this draft.

  "Web Cache Communication Protocol V2, Revision 1", Douglas McLaggan,
  2-Aug-12, <draft-mclaggan-wccp-v2rev1-00.txt>

    This document describes version 2 of the Web Cache Communication
    Protocol (WCCP).  The WCCP V2 protocol specifies interactions between
    one or more routers and one or more web-caches.  The interaction may
    take place within an IPv4 or IPv6 network.  The purpose of the
    interaction is to establish and maintain the transparent redirection
    of selected types of traffic flowing through a group of routers (or
    similar devices).  The selected traffic is redirected to a group of
    web-caches (or other traffic optimisation devices) with the aim of
    optimising resource usage and lowering response times.
    
    The protocol does not specify any interaction between the web-caches
    within a group or between a web-cache and a web-server.

  "OSPF-TE extensions for MLNMRN based on OTN", Khuzema Pithewan, Rajan
  Rao, 31-Jan-13, <draft-rao-ccamp-mlnmrn-otn-ospfte-ext-01.txt>

    This document specifies OSPF extensions for multi-layer/multi-region
    where one of the regions is OTN.

  "Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) Capabilities
  Interface", Kevin Ma, 4-Feb-13, <draft-ma-cdni-capabilities-01.txt>

    The interconnection of Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) is
       predicated on the ability of downstream CDNs (dCDNs) to handle end-
       user requests in a functionally equivalent manner to the upstream CDN
       (uCDN).  The uCDN must be able to assess the ability of the dCDN to
       handle individual requests.  A CDN interconnection (CDNI) interface
       is needed to facilitate the advertisement of capabilities by the dCDN
       to the uCDN.  This document describes an approach to implementing a
       CDNI capabilities advertisement interface.

  "LLCPS", Pascal Urien, 7-Feb-13, <draft-urien-tls-llcp-01.txt>

    This document describes the implementation, named LLCPS, of the TLS
       protocol over the NFC (Near Field Communication) LLCP (Logical Link
       Control Protocol) layer. The NFC peer to peer (P2P) protocol may be
       used by any application that needs communication between two devices
       at very small distances (a few centimeters). LLCPS enforces a strong
       security in NFC P2P exchanges, and may be deployed for many
       services, in the Internet Of Things ecosystem, such as access
       control or ticketing operations.

  "RPL Routing Pathology In a Network With a Mix of Nodes Operating in
  Storing and Non-Storing Modes", JeongGil Ko, Jongsoo Jeong, Jongjun
  Park, Jong Jun, Naesoo Kim, Omprakash Gnawali, 16-Feb-13,
  <draft-ko-roll-mix-network-pathology-02.txt>

    The RPL specification allows nodes running with storing or non-
       storing modes to operate in the same network.  We describe how such a
       mix can result in network partitioning even when there are plenty of
       physical links available in the network.  The partitioning affects
       both upwards (nodes to root) and downwards (root to leaf) traffic.
       This routing pathology stems from a recommendation made in the RPL
       specification forcing nodes with different modes of operation to join
       the RPL network as leaf nodes only.  We propose a solution that
       modifies RPL by mandating that all the nodes parse and interpret
       source routing headers and storing mode nodes to sometimes act like a
       non-storing mode root by attaching source routing headers.

  "An Architecture for splicing TE-LSPs in Hierarchical CsC scenarios",
  Bhargav Bhikkaji, Balaji Venkataswami, Shankar Raman, Gaurav Raina,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-balaji-mpls-csc-te-lsp-splice-02.txt>

    Hierarchical Carrier Supporting Carrier deployments involve a Carrier
       Core which hereinafter is called the Tier-1 provider and two or more
       VPN sites that are carriers themselves hereinafter called Tier-2
       providers that offer MPLS VPN services to their own customers. In
       such cases normally LDP is used to distribute labels amongst the
       routers (P and PE devices) in the Tier-2 provider's sites. When RSVP
       based TE-LSPs are constructed to explicitly route traffic for Tier-2
       ISP's customers from the Tier-2 PEs to the CE of the Tier-1 provider
       and such TE-LSPs exist on multiple sites of the Tier-2 provider, the
       Tier-2 ISP may require splicing together through an "auto-match-and-
       splice-together" facility such that traffic flows from the PE of the
       Tier-2 ISP through the TE-LSP onto the CE of the Tier-1 ISP and then
       onto the other site and takes a path through a specific TE-LSP from
       the CE of the other site to the destination Tier-2 PE and then onto
       the final customer.
    
       This solution offers a lot of advantages such as providing adequate
       assurance that the bandwidth for the traffic flowing through these
       spliced TE-LSPs is met. It also provides a explicit routing of the
       traffic rather than through the regular LDP (which follows IGP)
       scenarios. Such explicitly routed TE-LSPs would have been constructed
       taking into account factors such as using under-utilized links for
       example. Splicing together these TE-LSPs in various sites and doing
       the splicing on an auto-match based on bandwidth or delay metrics
       would be a good service to offer to the Tier-2 ISPs customers.
    
       This draft outlines a scheme that offers such a feature and service
       to the Tier-2 ISPs through the addition of certain additional label
       exchanges and some additional labels such as the RSVP-stitch label
       and the RSVP-splicing-LDP label in the label stack which can be used
       to splice together these tunnels. In case of re-optimization of the
       LSP end-to-end there is a wide variety of choices for the near-end PE
       to hook up with a suitable far-end tunnel in the other Tier-2 site.
    
       Explicit tunnel setup can be obviated by merely choosing from a set
       of already constructed tunnels based on criterion that may involve
       various parameters. Also fast-reroute in case of remote tunnel
       failure is taken care of.

  "SNMP based Provider-Provisioned label for Lawful Intercept in L3 VPNs",
  Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Vasan Srini, Bhargav
  Bhikkaji, 18-Feb-13, <draft-balaji-mpls-li-thru-label-dis-snmp-01.txt>

    In models of Single-AS and inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label
       Switching (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) Lawful
       Intercept is a key requirement. For example, MPLS-based Layer 3 VPN
       models do not have any provider provisioned methods of lawful
       intercept that are comprehensive, quick and easy to provision from
       one single point. More particularly the auto-provisioning of lawful
       intercept for all sets of streams travelling between VPN sites and
       consequent re-direction of these streams to the appropriate
       government network has not been covered without multiple instances of
       having to configure the intercept at various points in the network
       both in the Single-AS case and the Inter-Provider VPN case.
    
       In this paper, we propose a technique which uses a set of pre-defined
       labels called Lawful Intercept labels and a method for provisioning
       lawful intercept amongst the various PE devices using these labels
       both in the Single-AS and the inter-provider VPN cases. A single
       point of action is the key to this idea. The intercepted traffic is
       mirrored on a PE or a whole set of PEs or on all the PEs
       participating in the VPN. A technique called the Domino-effect
       provisioning of these Label-based Provider Provisioned Lawful
       Intercept mechanism is also outlined. This differs from [1] in that
       there is explicit use of a secure SNMP mechanism to provision the
       labels for Lawful Intercept at the various PEs instead of a MP-BGP
       update.

  "Babel HMAC Cryptographic Authentication", Denis Ovsienko, 18-Apr-13,
  <draft-ovsienko-babel-hmac-authentication-03.txt,.pdf>

    This document describes a cryptographic authentication mechanism for
       Babel routing protocol, updating, but not superceding RFC 6126.  The
       mechanism allocates two new TLV types for the authentication data,
       uses HMAC and is both optional and backward compatible.

  "The Open vSwitch Database Management Protocol", Ben Pfaff, Bruce Davie,
  15-Mar-13, <draft-pfaff-ovsdb-proto-02.txt>

    Open vSwitch is an open source software switch designed to be used as
       a vswitch (virtual switch) in virtualized server environments.  A
       vswitch forwards traffic between different virtual machines (VMs) on
       the same physical host and also forwards traffic between VMs and the
       physical network.  Open vSwitch is open to programmatic extension and
       control using OpenFlow and the OVSDB (Open vSwitch Database)
       management protocol.  This document defines the OVSDB management
       protocol.

  "Military Message Handling System (MMHS) over SMTP", Alexey Melnikov,
  Graeme Lunt, Alan Ross, 21-Jun-13, <draft-melnikov-mmhs-profile-04.txt>

    A Military Message Handling System (MMHS) processes formal messages
       ensuring release, distribution, security, and timely delivery across
       national and international strategic and tactical networks.  The MMHS
       Elements of Service are defined as a set of extensions to the ITU-T
       X.400 (1992) international standards and are specified in STANAG 4406
       Edition 2 or ACP 123.  This document specifies how a comparable
       messaging service can be provided using SMTP and its extensions.

  "IMAP SUBMIT Extension", Jan Kundrat, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-kundrat-imap-submit-01.txt>

    This document extends the IMAP protocol with a feature to submit
       e-mail messages for delivery.  It is intended to serve as a better
       alternative to the URLAUTH/BURL approach.

  "IMAP Extension for Incremental Threading (INCTHREAD)", Jan Kundrat,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-kundrat-incthread-01.txt>

    This document describes the INCTHREAD IMAP extension which enables
       clients to retrieve incremental updates of the mailbox threading.
       The extension repurposes the ESEARCH response for passing along the
       threading information and builds on top of Arnt Gulbrandsen's work on
       the INTHREAD search key.  The UID THREAD command is also extended to
       allow activating this extension.  Together, these changes make it
       possible for clients not to fetch the complete mailbox threading each
       time a new message arrives.

  "Aggregated Service Discovery", Andrew McMillan, Cyrus Daboo, 9-Jan-13,
  <draft-daboo-aggregated-service-discovery-02.txt>

    Access Control Lists (ACLs) on a device.

  "Resource-Oriented Lightweight Indicator Exchange", John Field,
  15-Feb-13, <draft-field-mile-rolie-01.txt>

    This document defines a resource-oriented approach to cyber security
       information sharing.  Using this approach, a CSIRT or other
       stakeholder may share and exchange representations of cyber security
       incidents, indicators, and other related information as Web-
       addressable resources.  The transport protocol binding is specified
       as HTTP(S) with a MIME media type of Atom+XML.  An appropriate set of
       link relation types specific to cyber security information sharing is
       defined.  The resource representations leverage the existing IODEF
       [RFC5070] and RID [RFC6545] specifications as appropriate.
       Coexistence with deployments that conform to existing specifications
       including RID [RFC6545] and Transport of Real-time Inter-network
       Defense (RID) Messages over HTTP/TLS [RFC6546] is supported via
       appropriate use of HTTP status codes.

       later.

  "Applicability of MPLS-TP Linear protection for p2mp", Guoman Liu,
  13-Mar-13, <draft-liu-mpls-tp-p2mp-linear-protection-01.txt>

    In MPLS-TP requirement document(rfc5654), there is a requirement to
       support 1+1 and 1:n protection for p2mp connectivity.  The
       requirement was described in MPLS-TP Survivability Framework
       document(RFC 6372) and draft-ietf-mpls-tp-p2mp-framework.  The basic
       protocol for linear protection was specified in the MPLS-TP Linear
       Protection document [RFC 6378] but is limited to 1+1 and 1:1
       protection for p2p connectivity.  in addtion, The 1:N protection in
       which all of working transport paths and the protection path have the
       same end points was specified in MPLS-TP 1:N protection document
       (draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection).This document applies the
       existing PSC(RFC 6378) and extensive PSC protocol(draft-ietf-mpls-tp-
       1toN-protection) to support scenarios of protecting the p2mp path by
       extending the existing p2p linear protection mechanism.  .
    
    This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
       Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
       Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include
       an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
       to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
       network as defined by the ITU-T.

  "RRCP A Receiver-Driven and Router-Feedback Congestion Control Protocol
  for ICN", Mingwei Xu, Chunmei Xia, 14-Mar-13, <draft-xu-rrcp-01.txt>

    Network requirements have evolved from data communications between
       two hosts to large-scale information access through networks. The
       current Internet employs an address-centric network communication
       model, which is efficient for communications between hosts, but not
       efficient for communications between a host and a network. Given
       this fact, Information-centric Networking (ICN) has become a hot
       spot to meet the new requirement.  In ICN there exists a congestion
       problem which hasn't been well solved. We provide a new congestion
       control protocol, RRCP, since the congestion control protocols in IP
       networks are not suitable for ICN transport.  RRCP, with XCP and ICN
       transport characteristics, advances a receiver-driven and router-
       feedback mechanism.  RRCP can stay efficient, fair and stable via
       the validation of simulation.

  "ENUM Service Registration for acct URI", Laurent Goix, Kepeng Li,
  6-May-13, <draft-goix-appsawg-enum-acct-uri-02.txt>

    This document registers a Telephone Number Mapping (ENUM) service for
       'acct:' URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).

  "The Key HTTP Response Header Field", Roy Fielding, Mark Nottingham,
  18-Feb-13, <draft-fielding-http-key-02.txt>

    The 'Key' header field for HTTP responses allows an origin server to
       describe the cache key for a negotiated response: a short algorithm
       that can be used upon later requests to determine if the same
       response is reusable.
    
       Key has the advantage of avoiding an additional round trip for
       validation whenever a new request differs slightly, but not
       significantly, from prior requests.
    
       Key also informs user agents of the request characteristics that
       might result in different content, which can be useful if the user
       agent is not sending Accept* fields in order to reduce the risk of
       fingerprinting.

  "SCIM and vCard mapping", Bert Greevenbosch, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-greevenbosch-scim-vcard-mapping-02.txt>

  "IP/MPLS Connectivity Provisioning Profile", Mohamed Boucadair,
  Christian Jacquenet, Ning Wang, 25-Sep-12,
  <draft-boucadair-connectivity-provisioning-profile-02.txt>

    This document describes the Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP)
    and proposes a CPP Template to capture IP connectivity requirements
    to be met in the context of delivery of services (e.g.  Voice over IP
    or IP TV) which are to be plugged upon an IP/MPLS infrastructure.
    The CPP defines the set of IP transfer parameters to be supported by
    the underlying IP/MPLS transport network together with a reachability
    scope and bandwidth/capacity needs.  Appropriate performance metrics
    such as one-way delay, one-way delay variation are used to
    characterize an IP transfer service.  Both global and restricted
    reachability scopes can be captured in the CPP.
    
    Having the generic CPP template allows for (1) automating the process
    of service negotiation and activation, thus accelerating service
    provisioning, (2) setting the (traffic) objectives of Traffic
    Engineering functions and service management functions and (3)
    enriching service and network management systems with 'decision-
    making' capabilities based on negotiated/offered CPPs.

  "Retrieving the Capabilities of a PCP-controlled Device", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Tirumaleswar Reddy, 30-May-13,
  <draft-boucadair-pcp-capability-02.txt>

       JSON.

  "MIF API for Connection Management", Pierrick Seite, Juan Zuniga,
  22-Feb-13, <draft-seite-mif-cm-01.txt>

    There is currently a need to present a coherent connection management
       behaviour for different terminal platforms (e.g. mobile phones, PCs,
       tablets, etc.).  This document discusses how a connection manager can
       use the MIF API to provide this coherent behaviour and enhance the
       end user's experience when a terminal is able to connect to multiple
       interfaces.  The goal of this document is not to define a connection
       manager specification, but to focus on the interaction with the MIF
       API and suggest relevant generic messages for the interface.
    
       This document is for discussion and its intention is to help
       clarifying the utilization of the MIF API in a connection management
       context and propose some relevant considerations.

  "Design Discussion and Comparison of Replay-Attack Protection Mechanisms
  for BGPSEC", Kotikalapudi Sriram, Doug Montgomery, 24-Mar-13,
  <draft-sriram-replay-protection-design-discussion-01.txt>

    The BGPSEC protocol requires a method for protection from replay
       attacks, at least to control the window of exposure.  In the context
       of BGPSEC, a replay attack occurs when an adversary suppresses a
       prefix withdrawal (implicit or explicit) or replays a previously
       received BGPSEC announcement for a prefix that has since been
       withdrawn.  This informational document provides design discussion
       and comparison of multiple alternative replay-attack protection
       mechanisms weighing their pros and cons.  It is meant to be a
       companion document to the standards track I-D.-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-
       rollover that will specify a method to be used with BGPSEC for
       replay-attack protection.

  "Autonomous System (AS) Migration Features and Their Effects on the BGP
  AS_PATH Attribute", Wesley George, Shane Amante, 19-Feb-13,
  <draft-ga-idr-as-migration-01.txt>

    This draft discusses common methods of managing an ASN migration
       using some BGP feaures that while commonly-used are not formally part
       of the BGP4 protocol specification and may be vendor-specific in
       exact implementation.  It is necessary to document these de facto
       standards to ensure that they are properly supported in BGPSec.

  "Mechanisms for Optimal LAG/ECMP Component Link Utilization in
  Networks", ramki, Sanjay Khanna, Lucy Yong, Anoop Ghanwani, So Ning,
  Bhumip Khasnabish, 24-Apr-13,
  <draft-krishnan-opsawg-large-flow-load-balancing-08.txt>

    Demands on networking infrastructure are growing exponentially; the
       drivers are bandwidth hungry rich media applications, inter-data
       center communications, etc. In this context, it is important to
       optimally use the bandwidth in wired networks that extensively use
       LAG/ECMP techniques for bandwidth scaling. This draft explores some
       of the mechanisms useful for achieving this.

  "Making BGP filtering a habit: Impact on policies", Pierre Francois,
  Camilo Cardona, 22-Feb-13, <draft-cardona-filtering-threats-01.txt>

    This draft describes threats to the Internet routing policies of an
    autonomous system due to filtering of more specific BGP prefixes by
    its neighboring domains.

  "CoAP Minimum Request Interval", Bert Greevenbosch, 26-Apr-13,
  <draft-greevenbosch-core-minimum-request-interval-01.txt>

    This document defines an "Minimum-Request-Interval" option for CoAP,
       which can be used to negotiate the minimum time between two
       subsequent requests within a single client and server pair.  It can
       be used for flow and congestion control, reducing the consumption of
       server and network resources when needed.
    
    Note
    
       Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should
       be sent to core@ietf.org.

  "Multihoming in Homenet", Wassim Haddad, Damien Saucez, 29-Mar-13,
  <draft-haddad-homenet-multihomed-01.txt>

    So far, multihoming in Homenet must be supported by the hosts as
       there is no mean to use simultaneously the different ISPs of the
       Homenet without risking flow disruption.  In this memo, we propose to
       revise the way multihoming is conceived in Homenet by relying on the
       infrastructure instead of the hosts.  We also propose a high level
       solution that answers this particular problem.

  "NFSv4 Multi-Domain FedFS Requirements", Andy Adamson, Nico Williams,
  17-Apr-13, <draft-adamson-nfsv4-multi-domain-federated-fs-reqs-02.txt>

    This document describes constraints to the NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1
       protocols as well as the use of multi-domain capable file systems,
       name resolution services, and security services required to fully
       enable a multi-domain NFSv4 federated file system.

  "Multiple Synchronization Sources (SSRC) in SDP Media Descriptions",
  Christer Holmberg, Magnus Westerlund, BoB, Fredrik Jansson, 27-Mar-13,
  <draft-westerlund-mmusic-max-ssrc-01.txt>

    This document describes use-cases where endpoints, for a given media
       type, use multiple media sources.  It also describes how endpoints
       normally support media sources, and limitations associated with the
       support of multiple sources.
    
       This document also defines two new SDP attributes, "max-send-ssrc"
       and "max-recv-ssrc".  The attributes allows an entity to, for a given
       media description, indicate sending and receiving capabilities of
       multiple media sources, based on codec usage .

  "Experiments on HTTP Adaptive Streaming over interconnected Content
  Delivery Networks", Jeroen Famaey, Steven Latre, 24-Jan-13,
  <draft-famaey-cdni-has-experiments-01.txt,.pdf>

    This document reports experimental results on the delivery of HTTP
       Adaptive Streaming (HAS) content over interconnected Content Delivery
       Networks (CDNs).  Specifically, the implications that CDN request
       routing between CDNs and HTTP redirection have on the quality of
       delivered HAS content are investigated.

  "Use of the Prefer Header Field in Web Distributed Authoring and

  "Loop Free DODAG Local Repair", Jianlin Guo, Philip Orlik, Ghulam
  Bhatti, 2-Apr-13, <draft-guo-roll-loop-free-dodag-repair-01.txt>

    IETF has been developing IPv6 based standards for Low-power and Lossy
       Networks (LLNs) to meet requirements of constrained applications,
       such as field monitoring, inventory control and so on. IPv6 Routing
       Protocol for LLNs (RPL) has been published in [RFC6550]. Based on
       routing metrics and constraints [RFC6551], RPL builds Directed
       Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology to establish bidirectional routes for
       LLNs for traffic types of multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint,
       and point-to-point. RPL routes are optimized for traffic to or from
       one or more roots that act as sinks. As a result, a DAG is
       partitioned into one or more Destination Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), one
       DODAG per sink. RPL is widely considered as a feasible routing
       protocol for LLNs. However, DODAG loops caused by local DODAG repair
       mechanism is an issues to be addressed. This draft introduces a loop
       free local DODAG repair mechanism. This draft also introduces a
       piggybacked data option for transferring delay sensitive data during
       route repair process. The piggybacked data can be included in DODAG
       Repair Request (DRQ) message or DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS)
       message.

  "ForCES Model Extension", Evangelos Haleplidis, 1-Apr-13,
  <draft-haleplidis-forces-model-extension-03.txt>

    Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an
       architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize
       information exchange between the control plane and the forwarding
       plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES NE).  RFC5812 has defined
       the ForCES Model provides a formal way to represent the capabilities,
       state, and configuration of forwarding elements within the context of
       the ForCES protocol, so that control elements (CEs) can control the
       FEs accordingly.  More specifically, the model describes the logical
       functions that are present in an FE, what capabilities these
       functions support, and how these functions are or can be
       interconnected.
    
       RFC5812 has been around for two years and experience in its use has
       shown room for small extensions without a need to alter the protocol
       while retaining backward compatibility with older xml libraries.
       This document extends the model to allow complex datatypes for
       metadata, optional default values for datatypes and optional access
       types for structures.  The document also introduces two new features,
       bitmap as a new datatype and a new event condition BecomesEqualTo.

  "Abstract", Ahmed Bashandy, Clarence Filsfils, Prodosh Mohapatra,
  29-Mar-13, <draft-rtgwg-bgp-pic-01.txt>

    In the network comprising thousands of iBGP peers exchanging millions
    of routes, many routes are reachable via more than one path. Given
    the large scaling targets, it is desirable to restore traffic after
    failure in a time period that does not depend on the number of BGP
    prefixes. In this document we proposed a technique by which traffic
    can be re-routed to ECMP or pre-calculated backup paths in a
    timeframe that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. The
    objective is achieved through organizing the forwarding chains in a
    hierarchical manner and sharing forwarding elements among the maximum
    possible number of routes. The proposed technique achieves prefix
    independent convergence while ensuring incremental deployment,
    complete transparency and automation, and zero management and
    provisioning effort

  "JSON Predicate", James Snell, 7-Jan-13, <draft-snell-json-test-05.txt>

    JSON Predicates defines a syntax for serializing various predicate
       expressions as JSON Objects.

  "A Mechanism for Diameter Overload Control", Adam Roach, Eric McMurry,
  17-May-13, <draft-roach-dime-overload-ctrl-03.txt>

    When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be
       able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to
       reduce or stop sending traffic for some period of time.  Otherwise,
       it must continue to expend resources parsing and responding to
       Diameter messages.
    
       This document proposes a concrete, application-independent mechanism
       to address the challenge of communicating load and overload state
       among Diameter peers, and specifies an algorithm for load abatement
       to address such overload conditions as they occur.  The load
       abatement algorithm is extensible, allowing for future documents to
       define additional load abatement approaches.

  "Domain Subobjects for Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic
  Engineering (RSVP-TE)", Dhruv Dhody, Udayasree Palle, Venugopal
  Kondreddy, Ramon Casellas, 2-Apr-13,
  <draft-dhody-ccamp-rsvp-te-domain-subobjects-01.txt>

    The RSVP-TE specification [RFC3209] and the GMPLS extensions to
       RSVP-TE [RFC3473] allow abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly
       included in a path setup.  Further Exclude Routes extensions
       [RFC4874] allow abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly
       excluded in a path setup.
    
       This document specifies new subobjects to include or exclude domains
       during path setup where domain is a collection of network elements
       within a common sphere of address management or path computational
       responsibility (such as an IGP area or an AS (4-Byte)).  Note that
       the use of Autonomous Number (AS) (2-Byte) as an abstract node
       representing domain is already defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC4874].

  "The Diameter Overload Control Application (DOCA)", Jouni Korhonen,
  Hannes Tschofenig, 25-Feb-13, <draft-korhonen-dime-ovl-01.txt>

    This specification documents a Diameter Overload Control Application
       (DOCA), which uses the normal Diameter application approach for the
       capability negotiation, propagation and management of Diameter
       overload control information between Diameter nodes.

  "Add 100.64.0.0/10 prefixes to IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zones Registry.",
  Mark Andrews, 1-Apr-13, <draft-andrews-dnsop-rfc6598-rfc6303-02.txt>

    RFC6598 specified that: "Reverse DNS queries for Shared Address Space
       addresses [100.64.0.0/10] MUST NOT be forwarded to the global DNS
       infrastructure."
    
       This document formally directs IANA to add the associated zones to
       the "IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zones Registry" to prevent such queries
       accidently leaking to the global DNS infrastructure.

  "The NetInf Protocol", Dirk Kutscher, Stephen Farrell, Elwyn Davies,
  10-Feb-13, <draft-kutscher-icnrg-netinf-proto-01.txt>

    This document defines a conceptual protocol and corresponding node
       requirements for NetInf nodes in a NetInf network.  A NetInf network
       offers an information-centric paradigm that supports the creation,
       location, exchange and storage of Named Data Objects (NDOs).  NetInf
       nodes can provide different services to other NetInf nodes, e.g.,
       forwarding requests for information objects, delivering corresponding
       response messages, name resolution services etc.  This (abstract)
       protocol is intended to be run over some "convergence layer" that
       handles transport issues.  Two "wire" formats are defined, one that
       uses HTTP for message transfer and one layered on UDP.

  "Parallel NFS (pNFS) Lustre Layout Operations", Sorin Faibish, Peng Tao,
  5-May-13, <draft-faibish-nfsv4-pnfs-lustre-layout-05.txt>

    Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends Network File System version 4.1(NFSv4.1)
       to allow clients to directly access file data on the storage used by
       the NFSv4.1 server. This ability to bypass the server for data
       access can increase both performance and parallelism, but requires
       additional client functionality for data access, some of which is
       dependent on the class of storage used, a.k.a. the Layout Type. The
       main pNFS operations and data types in NFSv4 Minor version 1 specify
       a layout-type-independent layer; layout-type-specific information is
       conveyed using opaque data structures whose internal structure is
       further defined by the particular layout type specification. This
       document specifies the NFSv4.1 Lustre pNFS Layout Type as a
       companion to the main NFSv4 Minor version 1 specification.

  "Modeling JSON Text with YANG", Ladislav Lhotka, 2-Apr-13,
  <draft-lhotka-netmod-yang-json-01.txt>

    This document defines rules for mapping data models expressed in YANG
       to configuration and operational state data encoded as JSON text.  It
       does so by specifying a procedure for translating the subset of YANG-
       compatible XML documents to JSON text, and vice versa.

  "IMAP4 Extensions for Quick Mailbox Resynchronization", Alexey Melnikov,
  Dave Cridland, 13-Feb-13, <draft-melnikov-5162bis-01.txt>

    This document defines an IMAP4 extension, which gives an IMAP client
       the ability to quickly resynchronize any previously opened mailbox as
       part of the SELECT command, without the need for server-side state or
       additional client round-trips.  This extension also introduces a new
       response that allows for a more compact representation of a list of
       expunged messages (and always includes the Unique Identifiers (UIDs)
       expunged).

  "Mitigating IPv6 Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack Using Stateless Neighbor
  Presence Discovery", Mark Smith, 20-Feb-13,
  <draft-smith-6man-mitigate-nd-cache-dos-slnd-06.txt>

    One of the functions of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery is to discover
       whether a specified neighbor is present.  During the neighbor
       presence discovery process state is created.  A node's capacity for
       this state can be intentionally exhausted to perform a denial of
       service attack, known as the "Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack".  This
       memo proposes a stateless form of neighbor presence discovery to
       prevent this Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack.

  "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Option for Port Set
  Assignment", Qiong Sun, Yiu Lee, Qi Sun, Gabor Bajko, Mohamed Boucadair,
  10-Apr-13, <draft-sun-dhc-port-set-option-01.txt>

    Because of the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space, several
       techniques have been proposed to share the same IPv4 address among
       several uses.  As an alternative to introducing a level of NAT in the
       provider's core network, this document provides a mechanism to assign
       non-overlapping port set to users assigned with the same IPv4
       address: Port Set DHCPv4 Option.

  "Advanced Stream and Sampling Framework for IPPM", Joachim Fabini, Al
  Morton, 22-Feb-13, <draft-morton-ippm-2330-update-01.txt>

    To obtain repeatable results in modern networks, test descriptions
       need an expanded stream parameter framework that also augments
       aspects specified as Type-P for test packets.  This memo proposes to
       update the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework with advanced
       considerations for measurement methodology and testing.  The existing
       framework mostly assumes deterministic connectivity, and that a
       single test stream will represent the characteristics of the path
       when it is aggregated with other flows.  Networks have evolved and
       test stream descriptions must evolve with them, otherwise unexpected
       network features may dominate the measured performance.  This memo
       describes new stream parameters for both network characterization and
       support of application design using IPPM metrics.

  "The application/stream+json Media Type", James Snell, 11-Oct-12,
  <draft-snell-activity-streams-type-01.txt>

    Content Type for the JSON Activity Streams format.

  "HTTP Link and Unlink Methods", James Snell, 22-Apr-13,
  <draft-snell-link-method-02.txt>

    This specification defines the semantics of the Link and Unlink HTTP
       methods.

  "CoRE Mirror Server", Matthieu Vial, 10-Apr-13,
  <draft-vial-core-mirror-server-01.txt>

    The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) working group aims at
       realizing the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) architecture in
       a suitable form for the most constrained nodes.  Thanks to the
       Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), REST is now applicable to
       constrained networks.  However the most energy-constrained devices
       may enter sleep mode and disconnect their network link during several
       minutes to save energy, hence preventing them from acting as
       traditional web servers.  This document describes how a sleeping
       device can store resource representations in an entity called Mirror
       Server and participate in a constrained RESTful environment.

  "SCIM Use Cases", Phil Hunt, Bhumip Khasnabish, Anthony Nadalin, Zachary
  Zeltsan, Kepeng Li, 5-Feb-13, <draft-zeltsan-scim-use-cases-01.txt>

       Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM).

  "ForCES Packet Parallelization", Evangelos Haleplidis, Joel Halpern,
  23-Feb-13, <draft-haleplidis-forces-packet-parallelization-02.txt>

    Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an
       architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize
       information exchange between the control plane and the forwarding
       plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES NE).  RFC5812 has defined
       the ForCES Model provides a formal way to represent the capabilities,
       state, and configuration of forwarding elements within the context of
       the ForCES protocol, so that control elements (CEs) can control the
       FEs accordingly.  More specifically, the model describes the logical
       functions that are present in an FE, what capabilities these
       functions support, and how these functions are or can be
       interconnected.
    
       Many network devices support parallel packet processing.  This
       document describes how ForCES can model a network device's
       parallelization datapath.

  "Quick Start Plus", Randall Stewart, Michael Tuexen, 17-Apr-13,
  <draft-stewart-tsvwg-qsp-02.txt>

    This document describes an extension to Quick Start including the
       missing Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) QuickStart chunk
       types and procedures so that SCTP may also use the QuickStart
       extension.

  "PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP Setup in a Stateful PCE Model",
  Edward Crabbe, Ina Minei, Siva Sivabalan, Robert Varga, 10-Apr-13,
  <draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp-01.txt>

    The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
       mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
       computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
    
       The extensions described in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] provide
       stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic
       Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP) via PCEP, for a model where
       the PCC delegates control over one or more locally configured LSPs to
       the PCE.  This document describes the creation and deletion of PCE-
       initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model.

  "ZSS Short Signature Scheme", Laura Hitt, 11-Feb-13,
  <draft-hitt-zss-02.txt>

    This document describes the ZSS Short Signature Scheme for
       implementation from bilinear pairings on supersingular elliptic
       curves. The ZSS Short Signature Scheme uses general cryptographic
       hash functions such as SHA-1 or SHA-2 and is efficient in terms of
       pairing operations.

  "The BinaryPack1pre2 JSON-like representation format", Carsten Bormann,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-bormann-apparea-bpack-01.txt>

    JSON (RFC 4627) is an extremely successful format for the
       representation of structured information, supporting Boolean values,
       numbers, strings, arrays, and tables.  Recently, a number of
       applications have started to look for binary representation formats
       that solve a similar problem.  In particular, constrained node
       networks can benefit from such a binary representation format.
    
       A very successful binary representation that is otherwise comparable
       to JSON is MessagePack.  Recently, a number of implementations have
       modified or extended MessagePack such that it allows for
       distinguishing UTF-8 strings from binary data.  Further discussion on
       the MessagePack repository has resulted in proposals how to integrate
       such an addition back into the MessagePack community.
    
       This draft, as an independent effort, documents one such format,
       tentatively calling it BinaryPack1pre2 while the MessagePack
       extension proposals make their way through the MessagePack community.
    
       The current version -01 of this document is a snapshot that
       demonstrates a general direction.  The details may change in future
       versions based on the development of the MessagePack specification.

  "ForCES Inter-FE LFB", DJ, Jamal Hadi Salim, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-joachimpillai-forces-interfelfb-01.txt>

    Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an
       architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize
       information exchange between the control plane and the forwarding
       plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES NE).  RFC5812 has defined
       the ForCES Model provides a formal way to represent the capabilities,
       state, and configuration of forwarding elements within the context of
       the ForCES protocol, so that control elements (CEs) can control the
       FEs accordingly.  More specifically, the model describes the logical
       functions that are present in an FE, what capabilities these
       functions support, and how these functions are or can be
       interconnected.
    
       At the moment the ForCES charter restricts the LFB topology to be
       within an FE.  This documents describes a non-intrusive way to extend
       the LFB topology across FEs.

  "EXI Messaging Requirements", Yusuke Doi, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-doi-exi-messaging-requirements-01.txt>

    EXI (Efficient XML Interchange) is a specification on efficient
       encoding of XML.  EXI is useful if an application requires XML based
       message exchange but no sufficient resource is available.  However,
       schema-informed mode of EXI needs some out-of-band coordination
       between communicating nodes.  This document discusses requirement on
       use of schema-informed EXI as a message exchange format on the
       Internet systems.

  "Network Virtualization Overlay Architecture", Roland Schott, Wenson Wu,
  18-Feb-13, <draft-fw-nvo3-server2vcenter-01.txt>

    Multiple virtual machines (VMs) created in a single physical platform
       Or vServer greatly improve the efficiency of data centers by enabling
       more work from less hardware.  Multiple vServer and associated
       virtual machines work together as one cluster make good use of
       resources of each vServer that are scattered into different data
       centers or vServers.  VMs have their lifecycles from VM creation, VM
       Power on to VM Power off and VM deletion.  The VMs may also move
       across the participating virtualization hosts (e.g., the
       virtualization server, hypervisor).  This document discusses how VMs,
       vServers and overlay network are managed by leveraging control plane
       function and management plane function and desired signaling
       functionalities for Network Virtualization Overlay.

  "The (Real) Internet Key Exchange", Dan Harkins, 12-Apr-13,
  <draft-harkins-ikev3-01.txt>

    The current version (v2) of the Internet Key Exchange failed to
       address many of the shortcomings of the original version (v1).  This
       memo defines a new version (v3) of the Internet Key Exchange that
       attempts to do so.

  "Requirements for DNS-SD/mDNS Extensions", Kerry Lynn, Stuart Cheshire,
  24-Jan-13, <draft-lynn-mdnsext-requirements-01.txt>

    DNS-SD/mDNS is widely used today for discovery and resolution of
       services and names on a local link, but there are use cases to extend
       DNS-SD/mDNS to enable service discovery beyond the local link.  This
       document provides a problem statement and a list of requirements.

  "Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol For Fast Reroute of
  Bidirectional Co-routed Traffic Engineering LSPs", Mike Taillon, Cisco
  Systems, Rakesh Gandhi, Zafar Ali, Manav Bhatia, Lizhong Jin, Frederic
  JOUNAY, 26-Apr-13,
  <draft-tsaad-ccamp-rsvpte-bidir-lsp-fastreroute-01.txt>

    This document defines RSVP-TE signaling extensions to support Fast
       Reroute (FRR) of bidirectional co-routed Traffic Engineering (TE)
       LSPs. These extensions enable the re-direction of bi-directional
       traffic and signaling onto bypass tunnels that ensure co-routedness
       of data and signaling paths in the forward and reverse directions
       after FRR. In addition, the RSVP-TE signaling extensions allow the
       coordination of bypass tunnel assignment protecting a common facility
       in both forward and reverse directions prior to or post failure
       occurrence.

  "Industrial Deterministic Routing Extension for Low-Power and Lossy
  Networks", Min Wei, Heng Wang, Ping Wang, Chao Zhou, 15-Apr-13,
  <draft-wei-roll-scheduling-routing-02.txt>

    Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have unique characteristics
       compared with traditional wired and ad-hoc networks. Deterministic
       networks is specified in IEEE 802.15.4e which is for deterministic
       applications in the industrial environment. Some routing metrics
       and constraints has been described in [RFC6551],[RFC5867] [RFC5826],
       [RFC5673], and [RFC5548]. There are several special characteristics
       and requirements in the industrial environment. This document
       defines a new Link Metric/Constraint Object-Scheduling Waiting
       Time to make RPL support deterministic scheduling mechanism, which
       could improve the determinacy and reliability of the LLNs in
       industrial environment.

  "Router Key PDU for RPKI-Router Protocol", Randy Bush, Keyur Patel, Sean
  Turner, 8-Apr-13, <draft-ymbk-rpki-rtr-keys-01.txt>

    The RPKI/Router Protocol v0 is specified to carry the PDUs necessary
       for RPKI-based Origin Validation.  For BGPsec Path Validation, the
       routers also need data extracted from BGPsec Router Certificates.
       This document adds a PDU to the RPKI/Router Protocol to carry those
       data.

  "URI Signing for CDN Interconnection (CDNI)", Kent Leung, Francois Le
  Faucheur, Bill Downey, Ray van Brandenburg, Scott Leibrand, 31-May-13,
  <draft-leung-cdni-uri-signing-02.txt>

    This document describes how the concept of URI signing supports the
       content access control requirements of CDNI and proposes a candidate
       URI signing scheme.
    
       The proposed URI signing method specifies the information needed to
       be included in the URI and the algorithm used to authorize and to
       validate access request for the content referenced by the URI.  Some
       of the information may be accessed by the CDN via configuration or
       CDNI metadata.

  "Header Delta-Compression for HTTP/2.0", Roberto Peon, 18-Mar-13,
  <draft-rpeon-httpbis-header-compression-03.txt>

    This document describes a mechanism for compressing streams of groups
       of key-value pairs, often known as Headers in an HTTP session.  See
       RFC 2616 [RFC2616] or successors for more information about headers.

  "Network Performance Measurement for IPsec", Yang Cui, Emily Bi, Kostas
  Pentikousis, 25-Feb-13, <draft-bi-ippm-ipsec-01.txt>

    IPsec is a mature technology with several interoperable
       implementations.  Indeed, the use of IPsec tunnels is increasingly
       gaining popularity in several deployment scenarios, not the least in
       what used to be solely areas of traditional telecommunication
       protocols.  Wider deployment calls for mechanisms and methods that
       enable tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure one-way and
       two-way network performance.  Unfortunately, however, standard IP
       performance measurement security mechanisms cannot be readily used
       with IPsec.  This document makes the case for employing IPsec to
       protect O/TWAMP and proposes a method which combines IKEv2 and
       O/TWAMP as defined in RFC 4656 and RFC 5357, respectively.  This
       specification aims, on the one hand, to ensure that O/TWAMP can be
       secured, while on the other hand, it extends the applicability of
       O/TWAMP to networks that have already deployed IPsec.

  "P-Charge-Info - A Private Header (P-Header) Extension to the Session
  Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Dan York, Tolga Asveren, 15-Mar-13,
  <draft-york-dispatch-p-charge-info-01.txt>

    This text documents 'P-Charge-Info', an existing private Session
       Initiation Protocol (SIP) header (P-header) used to convey billing
       information about the party to be charged.  This P-Header is
       currently in production usage by a number of equipment vendors and
       carriers and this document is submitted to request the registration
       of this header with IANA. This P-Header may also be used in some
       situations to carry the ISUP Charge Number parameter for PSTN
       interconnection.
    
       NOTE: This document has been in development since 2008 under the name
       draft-york-sipping-p-charge-info.  This -01 document is identical to
       draft-york-sipping-p-charge-info-15 except for edits to the text to
       indicate this is now for the DISPATCH working group as the SIPPING
       working group no longer exists.

  "VP8 as RTCWEB Mandatory to Implement", Harald Alvestrand, Adrian
  Grange, 25-Feb-13, <draft-alvestrand-rtcweb-vp8-01.txt>

    This document recommends that the RTCWEB working group choose the VP8
       specification as a mandatory to implement video codec for RTCWEB
       implementations.
    
       This document is not intended for publication as an RFC.

  "Multiple Upstream Interface Support for IGMP/MLD Proxy", Hitoshi
  Asaeda, Seil Jeon, 25-Feb-13, <draft-asaeda-pim-mldproxy-multif-01.txt>

    This document describes the way of supporting multiple upstream
       interfaces for an IGMP/MLD proxy device.  The proposed extension
       enables that an IGMP/MLD proxy device receives multicast packets
       through multiple upstream interfaces.  The upstream interface is
       selected with manually configured supported address prefixes and
       interface priority value.  A take-over operation switching from an
       inactive upstream interface to an active upstream interface is also
       considered.

  "Vulnerability Data Model",  harold.booth@nist.gov, Karen Scarfone,
  25-Apr-13, <draft-booth-sacm-vuln-model-02.txt>

    This Internet-Draft describes the Vulnerability Data Model (VDM)
       version 1.0, a vendor neutral data model for expressing data and
       metadata for individual vulnerabilities, and an XML format that can
       be used to exchange vulnerability data model information.  VDM
       provides standard fields, formats and vocabularies that can be used
       to transmit information about software vulnerabilities between
       entities in an interoperable manner.  VDM is suited for a wide
       variety of use cases, and provides extension points to facilitate
       additional use cases.

  "H.264 as Mandatory to Implement Video Codec for WebRTC", BoB, Markus
  Isomaki, Bernard Aboba, Gaelle Martin-Cocher, Giridhar Mandyam, Xavier
  Marjou, 25-Feb-13, <draft-burman-rtcweb-h264-proposal-01.txt>

  <draft-cao-lwig-syn-layer-01.txt>

    This document analyzes the problem of energy efficient protocol
       implementation, and proposes an energy efficient design of mulitiple
       protocols by utilizing a common shim layer to synchronize the packet
       receipt and transimission on a single node.

  "Service Discovery in a Multiple Connection Environment: Problem
  Statement", Zehn Cao, Aaron Ding, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-cao-mif-srv-dis-ps-02.txt>

    This document analyzes the problems of service discovery in a
       multiple connection environment.  A multiple connection environment
       consists of multiple-interfaced nodes connecting to multiple networks
       or multiple provisioning domains.  Given a type of service a
       multiple-interfaced client is looking for, the discovery progress
       ought to return a correct pointer to the service instance that the
       client is able to access without trying every available channel.

  "Extension of the MLD proxy functionality to support multiple upstream
  interfaces", Luis Contreras, Carlos Bernardos, Juan Zuniga, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-contreras-multimob-multiple-upstreams-01.txt>

    This document presents different scenarios of applicability for an
       MLD proxy running more than one upstream interface. Since those
       scenarios impose different requirements on the MLD proxy with
       multiple upstream interfaces, it is important to ensure that the
       proxy functionality addresses all of them for compatibility.
    
       The purpose of this document is to define the requirements in an MLD
       proxy with multiple interfaces covering a variety of applicability
       scenarios, and to specify the proxy functionality to satisfy all of
       them.

  Benham, David Singer, Krasimir Kolarov, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-dbenham-webrtc-videomti-01.txt>

    This memo proposes that H.264/AVC be selected as the mandatory-to-
       implement (MTI) video codec for RTCweb due to is Adoption Advantage,
       Quality-Power-Bandwidth advantage, Hardware Acceleration Advantage
       and Well-established IPR Status.

  "Distribution of MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) LSP State using BGP", Jie
  Dong, Mach Chen, 25-Feb-13, <draft-dong-idr-te-lsp-distribution-01.txt>

    This document describes a mechanism to collect the Traffic
       Engineering (TE) LSP information using BGP.  Such information can be
       used by external components for path reoptimization, service
       placement and network visualization.

  "A Framework for L3VPN Performance Monitoring", Jie Dong, Zhenbin Li,
  Bhavani Parise, 17-Apr-13, <draft-dong-l3vpn-pm-framework-01.txt>

    The capability of BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (L3VPN)
       performance monitoring (PM) is important to meet the Service Level
       Agreement(SLA) for the service beared.  Since multipoint-to-point or
       multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) network model applies, flow
       identifying is a big challenge for L3VPN PM.  This document specifies
       the framework and mechanisms for the application of L3VPN PM.

  "Requirements for Power Aware Network", Jie Dong, Mingui Zhang, Beichuan
  Zhang, Mohamed Boucadair, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-dong-panet-requirement-01.txt>

    Energy consumption of networks is rising fast, which results in the
       increase of network operational costs.  There are emerging demands
       from operators for power-aware networking (PANET) which could
       adaptively reduce the network energy consumption when possible.  This
       document presents the requirements which should be considered in
       building a power aware network.

  "Layer-3 virtual network overlays based on BGP Layer-3 VPNs", Dhananjaya
  Rao, John Mullooly, Rex Fernando, 14-Mar-13,
  <draft-drao-bgp-l3vpn-virtual-network-overlays-01.txt>

    Virtual network overlays are being designed and deployed in various
       types of networks, including data centers.  These network overlays
       address several requirements including flexible network
       virtualization and multi-tenancy, increased scale, and support for
       mobility of virtual machines.  Such overlay networks can be used to
       provide both Layer-2 and Layer-3 network services to hosts at the
       network edge.  New packet encapsulations are being defined and
       standardized to support these virtual networks.  These
       encapsulations, such as VXLAN and NVGRE, are primarily based on IP
       and are currently defined to support a Layer-2 forwarding service.
    
       BGP based Layer-3 VPNs, as specified in RFC 4364, provide an industry
       proven and well-defined solution for supporting Layer-3 virtual
       network services.  However, RFC 4364 procedures use MPLS labels to
       provide the network virtualization capability in the data plane.
       With the increasing support for IP overlay encapsulations in data
       center devices, there is a strong preference to utilize this support
       to deploy Layer-3 virtual networks using the familiarpolicy and
       operational primitives of Layer-3 VPNs.
    
       This document describes the use of BGP Layer-3 VPNs alongwith the new
       IP-based virtual network overlay encapsulations to provide a Layer-3
       virtualization solution for all IP traffic, and specifies mechanisms
       to use the new encapsulations while continuing to leverage the BGP
       Layer-3 VPN control plane techniques and extensions.  This mechanism
       provides an efficient incremental solution to support forwarding for
       IP traffic, irrespective of whether it is destined within or across
       an IP subnet boundary.

  "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Authorization Using DTCP Certificate",
  Darshak Thakore, 24-Feb-13, <draft-dthakore-tls-authz-03.txt>

    This document specifies the use of DTCP certificate as an
       authorization extension in the Transport Layer Security Handshake
       Protocol, according to guidelines in RFC 5878.  Extensions carried in
       the client and server Hello messages confirm that both parties
       support the desired authorization data types.  Then if supported by
       both the client and server, DTCP certificates are exchanged in the
       supplemental data handshake TLS handshake message as specified in
       RFC4680.

  "TRILL: Nickname and Label Properties", Donald Eastlake, Hao Weiguo,
  17-Apr-13, <draft-eastlake-trill-nick-label-prop-01.txt>

    There are a number of current and prospective requirements to
       indicate properties of nicknames, labels, and blocks thereof, for use
       with the TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links, RFC
       6325) protocol. To meet that need, this document specifies IS-IS
       (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) sub-TLVs and some of
       their uses.

  "Report from the 'Smart Object Security Workshop', March 23, 2012,
  Paris, France", Johannes Gilger, Hannes Tschofenig, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-gilger-smart-object-security-workshop-01.txt>

    This document provides a summary of a workshop on 'Smart Object
    Security', which took place in Paris on March 23, 2012.  The main
    goal of the workshop was to allow participants to share their
    thoughts about the ability to utilize existing and widely deployed
    security mechanisms for smart objects.
    
    This report summarizes the discussions and lists the conclusions and
    recommendations to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
    community.

  "Security Requirements in the Software Defined Networking Model", Sam
  Hartman, Dacheng Zhang, 17-Apr-13,
  <draft-hartman-sdnsec-requirements-01.txt>

    Software defined/driven networks provide new dimensions of
       flexibility in network design.  This document analyzes security
       requirements as we design protocols to support multiple network
       applications on an SDN in an open manner.

  "Observations on the experience and nature of Large Interim Meetings",

    Planning, particpipation and conclusions from the experience of
    participating in the IETF LIM activity on september 29th 2012.

  "A Framework for Semantic IPv6 Prefix", Sheng Jiang, Qiong Sun, Ian
  Farrer, Yang Bo, 27-May-13, <draft-jiang-v6ops-semantic-prefix-03.txt>

    This document describes a framework method that network operations
       may use their addresses.  Network operators, who have large IPv6
       address space, may choose to embedded some semantics into IPv6
       addresses by assigning additional significance to specific bits
       within the prefix.  By embedded semantics into IPv6 prefixes, the
       semantics of packets can be inspected easily.  Routers and other
       intermediary devices can easily apply relevant policies as required.
       Packet-level differentiation can also enable flow-level and user-
       level differentiation.  Consequently, the network operators can
       accordingly treat network packets differently and efficiently.  The
       management and maintenance of networks can be much simpler.

  "Prefix Delegation extension to Neighbor Discovery protocol", Arnaud
  Kaiser, Sylvain Decremps, Nouha Oualha, Alexandru Petrescu, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-kaiser-nd-pd-01.txt,.pdf>

    This document describes an extension to the Neighbor Discovery
       protocol (ND).  The proposed extension enhances ND by providing it
       with a new option: the Prefix Delegation option (ND-PD).  ND-PD
       offers the possibility for routers on a same link to ask for or
       delegate IPv6 prefixes.

  "Service Advertisement using BGP", Keyur Patel, Jan Medved, Burjiz
  Pithawala, 26-Apr-13, <draft-keyupate-bgp-services-02.txt>

    A variety of services, such as NATs, firewalls, or caches, can be
       embedded in a service provider network or instantiated in data
       centers attached to the network.  This document proposes extensions
       to BGP that facilitate discovery of such service instances by
       interested clients and allows dissemination of service information,
       such as services capabilities or capacities, thoughtout the network
       domain.  The proposed extensions allow for optimal routing of
       requests to service instances that can optimally serve them.

  "Network Virtualization Hypervisor-to-NVE Overlay Control Protocol
  Requirements", Lawrence Kreeger, Thomas Narten, David Black, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-kreeger-nvo3-hypervisor-nve-cp-01.txt>

    The document "Problem Statement: Overlays for Network Virtualization"
       discusses the needs for network virtualization using overlay networks
       in highly virtualized data centers.  The problem statement outlines a
       need for control protocols to facilitate running these overlay
       networks.  This document outlines the high level requirements related
       to the interaction between hypervisors and the Network Virtualization
       Edge device when the two entities are not co-located on the same
       physical device.

  "A Framework for Service-Driven Co-Routed MPLS Traffic Engineering
  LSPs", Zhenbin Li, Jie Dong, 17-Apr-13,
  <draft-li-mpls-serv-driven-co-lsp-fmwk-01.txt>

    MPLS TE has been widely deployed to provide traffic engineering and
       traffic protection.  The complexity in configuration has much effect
       on the MPLS TE deployment in the large-scale network.  The document
       identifies the configuration issues for MPLS TE deployment and
       proposes a new mechanism, the service-driven mechanism, by which the
       setup of co-routed MPLS TE LSPs is triggered by the bidirectional
       service.  Then the document provides the framework for setting up
       service-driven co-routed MPLS Traffic-Engineered Label-Switched
       Paths(TE LSPs) for L2VPN and L3VPN.

  "Routing Extension for Fast-Reroute Using Maximally Redundant Trees",
  Zhenbin Li, Nan Wu, Quintin Zhao, 28-Mar-13,
  <draft-li-rtgwg-igp-ext-mrt-frr-01.txt>

    The document proposes the routing protocol extension and procedures
    to support fast reroute using maximally redundant trees.

  "Applicability of LDP Multi-Topology for Unicast Fast-reroute Using
  Maximally Redundant Trees", Zhenbin Li, Tao Chou, Quintin Zhao, Tianle
  Yang, 26-Apr-13, <draft-li-rtgwg-ldp-mt-mrt-frr-02.txt>

    In this document, procedures' considerations on the applicability of
       LDP MT for unicast fast-reroute using MRT are provided.  The
       behaviors of label allocation and label forwarding entry setup with
       LDP Multi-Topology and MRT fast-reroute are described in details.
       Different application scenarios of the combining of the LDP multi-
       topology(MT) and unicast fast-reroute using Maximally Redundant
       Trees(MRT) are also analyzed.

  "Distributed Mobility Management - Framework & Analysis", Marco Liebsch,
  Pierrick Seite, Georgios Karagiannis, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-liebsch-dmm-framework-analysis-01.txt>

    Mobile operators consider the distribution of mobility anchors to
       enable offloading some traffic from their core network.  The
       Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) Working Group is investigating
       the impact of decentralized mobility management to existing protocol
       solutions, while taking into account well defined requirements, which
       are to be met by a future solution.  This document discusses DMM
       using a functional framework.  Functional Entities to support DMM as
       well as reference points between these Functional Entities are
       introduced and described.  The described functional framework allows
       distribution and co-location of Functional Entities and build a DMM
       architecture that matches the architecture of available protocols.
       Such methodology eases the analysis of best current practices with
       regard to functional and protocol gaps.

  "Operational management of Loop Free Alternates", Stephane Litkowski,
  Bruno Decraene, Clarence Filsfils, Kamran Raza, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-litkowski-rtgwg-lfa-manageability-01.txt>

    Loop Free Alternates (LFA), as defined in RFC 5286 is an IP Fast
       ReRoute (IP FRR) mechanism enabling traffic protection for IP traffic
       (and MPLS LDP traffic by extension).  Following first deployment
       experiences, this document provides operational feedback on LFA,
       highlights some limitations, and proposes a set of refinements to
       address those limitations.  It also proposes required management
       specifications.
    
       This proposal is also applicable to remote LFA solution.

  "Session Peering Provisioning (SPP) Protocol over REST", Mickael
  Marrache, David Schwartz, Syed Ali, 22-Apr-13,
  <draft-marrache-drinks-spp-protocol-rest-02.txt,.pdf>

    The Session Peering Provisioning Framework (SPPF) is a framework that
       exists to enable the provisioning of session establishment data into
       Session Data Registries or SIP Service Provider data stores.  This
       SPP Protocol implementation follows the REST architectural principles
       over HTTP to allow efficient provisioning of session establishment
       data.  The benefits include inter alia better performances under high
       loads through the use of HTTP caches and proxies and less coupling
       between clients and servers.  This document describes the
       specification of a protocol for transporting SPPF structures over
       HTTP(s) following REST architectural principles.

  "Model Based Internet Performance Metrics", Matt Mathis, Al Morton,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-mathis-ippm-model-based-metrics-01.txt>

    We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to determine
       if a long path can meet predefined end-to-end application performance
       targets.  This is done by section-by-section testing -- by applying a
       suite of single property tests to successive sections of a long path.
       In many cases these single property tests are based on existing IPPM
       metrics, with the addition of success and validity criteria.  The
       sub-path at a time tests are designed to facilitate IP providers
       eliminating all known conditions that might prevent the full end-to-
       end path from meeting the users target performance.
    
       This approach makes it possible to to determine the IP performance
       requirements needed to support the desired end-to-end TCP
       performance.  The IP metrics are based on traffic patterns that mimic
       TCP but are precomputed independently of the actual behavior of TCP
       over the sub-path under test.  This makes the measurements open loop,
       eliminating nearly all of the difficulties encountered by traditional
       bulk transport metrics, which rely on congestion control equilibrium
       behavior.
    
       A natural consequence of this methodology is verifiable network
       measurement: measurements from any given vantage point are repeatable
       from other vantage points.

  "RSVP-TE LSP egress fast-protection", Jeyananth Jeganathan, Hannes
  Gredler, Yimin Shen, 25-Apr-13,
  <draft-minto-rsvp-lsp-egress-fast-protection-02.txt>

    RFC4090 defines a fast reroute mechanism for locally repairing an
       RSVP-TE LSP in the order of 10s of milliseconds, in the event of a
       downstream link or node failure.  However, this mechanism does not
       provide node protection for LSP egress nodes, even when an alternate
       egress node (a backup egress) is available that could carry the
       traffic to its ultimate destination.  This document addresses this
       scenario and describes how to provide egress protection by
       establishing a bypass LSP from the penultimate-hop node of a LSP to
       the backup egress node.  The methods described in this document
       enable local repair in the order of 10s of milliseconds, in the event
       of the egress node failure.  These methods are only applicable if
       traffic carried by the LSP can be rerouted to its ultimate
       destination by the backup egress node.

  "Using NTP Extension Fields without Authentication", Tal Mizrahi, Danny
  Mayer, 14-Feb-13, <draft-mizrahi-ntp-extension-field-01.txt>

    The Network Time Protocol Version 4 (NTPv4) defines the optional
       usage of extension fields. An extension field is an optional field
       that resides at the end of the NTP header, and can be used to add
       optional capabilities or additional information that is not conveyed
       in the standard NTP header. The current definition of extension
       fields in NTPv4 is somewhat ambiguous regarding the connection
       between extension fields and the presence of a Message Authentication
       Code (MAC). This draft clarifies the usage of extension fields in the
       presence and in the absence of a MAC, while maintaining
       interoperability with existing implementations.

  "HTTP 2.0 Negotiation", Willy Tarreau, Stephan Emile, Gabriel
  Montenegro, 16-Jan-13,
  <draft-montenegro-httpbis-http2-negotiation-01.txt>

    This document describes an Upgrade-based protocol negotiation
       proposal for HTTP 2.0.

  "A One-Way Delay Metric for IPPM", Guy Almes, Sunil Kalidindi, Matthew
  Zekauskas, Al Morton, 22-Apr-13, <draft-morton-ippm-2679-bis-02.txt>

    This memo (RFC 2679 bis) defines a metric for one-way delay of
       packets across Internet paths.  It builds on notions introduced and
       discussed in the IPPM Framework document, RFC 2330; the reader is
       assumed to be familiar with that document.

  "Security Analysis of the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) OpenFlow
  Switch Specification", Margaret Wasserman, Sam Hartman, 17-Apr-13,
  <draft-mrw-sdnsec-openflow-analysis-02.txt>

    This document discusses the security properties of the OpenFlow
       Switch Specification version 1.3.0 (OpenFlow), a Software-Defined
       Network (SDN) solution produced by the Open Networking Foundation
       (ONF).  It analyzes the suitability of OpenFlow for use in "the
       cloud" or on the open Internet.  It also makes some suggestions about
       how OpenFlow could be made more secure for use in those environments.

  "SDP for the WebRTC", Suhas Nandakumar, Cullen Jennings, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-nandakumar-rtcweb-sdp-01.txt,.pdf>

    The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) [WEBRTC] working group is
       charged to provide protocol support for direct interactive rich
       communication using audio, video and data between two peers' web
       browsers.  With in the WebRTC framework, Session Description protocol
       (SDP) [RFC4566] is used for negotiating session capabilities between
       the peers.  Such a negotiataion happens based on the SDP Offer/Answer
       exchange mechanism described in the RFC 3264 [RFC3264].
    
       This document serves a introductory purpose in describing the role of
       SDP for the most common WebRTC use-cases.

  "Cryptographic Security Characteristics of 802.11 Wireless LAN Access
  Systems", Stephen Orr, Anthony Grieco, Dan Harkins, 15-Oct-12,
  <draft-orr-wlan-security-architectures-00.txt>

    This note identifies all of the places that cryptography is used in
    Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) architectures, to simplify the
    task of selecting the protocols, algorithms, and key sizes needed to
    achieve a consistent security level across the entire architecture.

  "Using Extended Key Usage (EKU) for REsource LOcation And Discovery
  (RELOAD) X.509 Certificates", Marc Petit-Huguenin, 29-Apr-13,
  <draft-petithuguenin-p2psip-reload-eku-01.txt>

    This document describes an Extended Key Usage (EKU) X.509 certificate
       extension for restricting the usage of a certificate to a REsource
       LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) overlay.

  "Resource Reservation Protocol Multiple Instance Object", James Polk,
  Subha Dhesikan, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-polk-rsvp-multi-instance-object-01.txt>

    This document creates the framework for a new Resource Reservation
       Protocol version 1 (RSVP) object for instances in which there are
       multiple occurrences of existing RSVP objects is to be included
       within the same RSVP message. This document offers two instances for
       multiple versions of the same object will be valid in RSVP messages,
       for more than one traffic specification object (TSPEC), and more
       than one TSPEC priority object (PREEMPTION_PRI).

  "Transaction SIGnature (TSIG) using CGA Algorithm in IPv6",  Hosnieh, 
  martin@v.loewis.de, Christoph Meinel, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-rafiee-intarea-cga-tsig-02.txt>

    The first step in the Transaction SIGnature (TSIG) (RFC 2845) process
       is the generation of a shared secret to be used between a DNS server
       and a host. The second step consists of modifying the DNS
       configuration so that the DNS server will know what key to use with
       which host, because this shared secret is only valid between a pair
       of hosts. This document, CGA-TSIG, proposes a possible way to
       eliminate the human intervention needed for the generation and
       exchange of keys between a DNS server and a host when SEcure Neighbor
       Discovery (SEND) (RFC 3971) is used. CGA-TSIG will facilitate the
       authentication process of a host with a DNS server and will reduce
       the time needed to accomplish DNS Updates. It will also provide a
       means for securing the authentication process between resolvers and
       clients. CGA-TSIG will be added, as an extension, to TSIG in order to
       provide data integrity and proof of IP address ownership. The current
       signature generation and verification process used in TSIG will be
       substituted with the use of the same parameters as are used in
       generating a secure address in IPv6 networks, i.e., Cryptographically
       Generated Addresses (CGA) (RFC 3972).

  "LISP Impact", Damien Saucez, Luigi Iannone, Florin Coras, 20-Feb-13,
  <draft-saucez-lisp-impact-01.txt>

    The Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) aims at improving
       the Internet scalability properties leveraging on three simple
       principles: address role separation, encapsulation, and mapping.  In
       this document, based on implementation, deployment, and theoretical
       studies, we discuss the impact that deployment of LISP has on both
       the Internet in general and for the end-users in particular.

  "Multi-Path Time Synchronization", Alex Shpiner, Richard Tse, Craig
  Schelp, Tal Mizrahi, 17-Feb-13,
  <draft-shpiner-multi-path-synchronization-01.txt>

    Clock synchronization protocols are very widely used in IP-based
       networks. The Network Time Protocol (NTP) has been commonly deployed
       for many years, and the last few years have seen an increasingly
       rapid deployment of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP). As time-
       sensitive applications evolve, clock accuracy requirements are
       becoming increasingly stringent, requiring the time synchronization
       protocols to provide high accuracy. Slave Diversity is a recently
       introduced approach, where the master and slave clocks (also known as
       server and client) are connected through multiple network paths, and
       the slave combines the information received through all paths to
       obtain a higher clock accuracy compared to the conventional one-path
       approach.  This document describes a multi-path approach to PTP and
       NTP over IP networks, allowing the protocols to run concurrently over
       multiple communication paths between the master and slave clocks. The
       multi-path approach can significantly contribute to clock accuracy,
       security and fault protection. The Multi-Path Precision Time Protocol
       (MPPTP) and Multi-Path Network Time Protocol (MPNTP) define an
       additional layer that extends the existing PTP and NTP without the
       need to modify these protocols. MPPTP and MPNTP also allow backward
       compatibility with nodes that do not support the multi-path
       extension.

  "Flow Specification Extensions to OSPF Protocol", Rashmi Shrivastava,
  Mike Dubrovsky, Keyur Patel, Burjiz Pithawala, 17-Apr-13,
  <draft-shrivastava-ospf-flow-spec-01.txt>

    This document describes the extensions to the OSPF protocol to
       distribute the traffic flow specification rules and associated
       actions.  The notion and principles of operation of the mechanism
       were initially introduced into the BGP protocol.  The IPv4 part of
       specification was published in RFC5575 and later the specification
       was enhanced for IPv6 via draft-raszuk-idr-flow-spec-v6.  The
       mechanism allows the routing protocol to distribute information about
       the traffic flows and associated actions such as packet filtering
       with it.

  "IKEv2 Fragmentation", Valery Smyslov, 10-Apr-13,
  <draft-smyslov-ipsecme-ikev2-fragmentation-01.txt>

    This document describes the way to avoid IP fragmentation of large
       IKEv2 messages.  This allows IKEv2 messages to traverse network
       devices that don't allow IP fragments to pass through.

  "Use case of IPv6 prefix semantics for operators", Qiong Sun, Qiong Sun,
  Sheng Jiang, 25-Feb-13, <draft-sun-semantic-usecase-02.txt>

    Embedding certain semantics into IPv6 addresses will bring a lot of
       benifits for operators to simplify network management and apply
       operations accordingly[I-D.jiang-semantic-prefix].  This memo
       illustrates the use case of semantic bits from operator's point of
       view, and provides considerations on how to design the semantic bits
       in IPv6 address.

  "Why Operators Filter Fragments and What It Implies", Joel Jaeggli,
  Lorenzo Colitti, Warren Kumari, Eric Vyncke, Merike Kaeo, Tom Taylor,
  4-Jun-13, <draft-taylor-v6ops-fragdrop-01.txt>

    This memo was written to make application developers and network
       operators aware of the significant possibility that IPv6 packets
       containing fragmentation extension headers may fail to reach their
       destination.  Some protocol or application assumptions about the
       ability to use messages larger than a single packet may accordingly
       not be supportable in all networks or circumstances.
    
       This memo provides observational evidence for the dropping of IPv6
       fragments along a significant number of paths, explores the
       operational impact of fragmentation and the reasons and scenarios
       where drops occur, and considers the effect of fragment drops on
       applications where fragmentation is known to occur, particularly
       including DNS.

  "A Hitchhiker's Guide to the (Datagram) Transport Layer Security
  Protocol for Smart Objects and Constrained Node Networks", Hannes
  Tschofenig, Johannes Gilger, Matthias Kovatsch, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-tschofenig-lwig-tls-minimal-02.txt>

    Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a widely used security protocol
       that offers communication security services at the transport layer.
       The initial design of TLS was focused on the protection of
       applications running on top of the Transmission Control Protocol
       (TCP), and was a good match for securing the Hypertext Transfer
       Protocol (HTTP).  The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as
       a more recent connection-oriented transport protocol, also benefits
       from TLS support.  Subsequent standardization efforts lead to the
       publication of the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol,
       which allows TLS payloads to be exchanged on top of the User Datagram
       Protocol (UDP), and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).
    
       TLS can be customized in a variety of ways and every feature has a
       certain cost.  To offer input for implementers and system architects
       this document provides guidance for the usage of TLS and DTLS
       features for smart objects and constraint node networks.

  "STP Application of ICCP", Mingui Zhang, Huafeng Wen, 1-May-13,
  <draft-zhang-iccp-stp-03.txt>

    Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol (ICCP) supports the inter-
       chassis redundancy mechanism which achieves high network
       availability.
    
       In this document, the PEs in a Redundant Group (RG) running ICCP are
       used to offer multi-homed connectivity to Spanning Tree Protocol
       (STP) networks. The ICCP TLVs for the STP application are defined,
       therefore PEs from the RG can make use of these TLVs to synchronize
       the state and configuration data.

  Junxiao Shi, Jie Dong, Mingui Zhang, Mohamed Boucadair, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-zhang-panet-problem-statement-02.txt>

    Energy consumption of network infrastructures is growing fast due to
       exponential growth of data traffic and the deployment of increasingly
       powerful equipment.  There are emerging needs for power-aware routing
       and traffic engineering, which adapt routing paths to traffic load in
       order to reduce energy consumption network-wide.  This document
       outlines the design space and problem areas for potential IETF work.

  <draft-zhang-panet-use-cases-02.txt>

    Power Aware NETwork (PANET) has attracted strong interest from both
       carriers and vendors. Several use cases are investigated in this
       document to exhibit the potential usage of PANET in both backbone and
       data center networks.

  "Performance Monitoring Analysis for L3VPN", Lianshu Zheng, Zhenbin Li,
  Bhavani Parise, 17-Apr-13, <draft-zheng-l3vpn-pm-analysis-01.txt>

    To perform the measurement of packet loss, delay and other metrics on
       a particular VPN flow, the egress PE need to tell to which specific
       ingress VRF a packet belongs to.  But for L3VPN, multipoint-to-point
       or multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) network model applies, flow
       identifying is a big challenge.  This document summarizes the current
       performance monitoring mechanisms for MPLS networks, and analyzes the
       challenge for L3VPN performance monitoring.  This document also
       discuss the key points need to be taken in consideration when
       designing L3VPN performance monitoring mechanisms.

  "VRRP PIM Interoperability", Wei Zhou, 21-Feb-13,
  <draft-zhou-pim-vrrp-01.txt>

    This document introduces VRRP Aware PIM, a redundancy mechanism for
       the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) to interoperate with Virtual
       Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).  It allows PIM to track VRRP state
       and to preserve multicast traffic upon failover in a redundant
       network with virtual routing groups enabled.

  "VLAN Identifier option in DHCP", Chunhui Zhu, Yangwei Tu, 17-Apr-13,
  <draft-zhu-dhc-vlan-id-option-01.txt>

    This document defines a new option for the Dynamic Host Configuration
       Protocol for IPv4 and IPv6.  This option can be used by the DHCP
       server to carry the VLAN identifier to the DHCP client to distinguish
       different connections in the access network.

  "NADA: A Unified Congestion Control Scheme for Real-Time Media",
  Xiaoqing Zhu, Rong Pan, 12-Mar-13, <draft-zhu-rmcat-nada-01.txt>

    This document describes a scheme named network-assisted dynamic
       adaptation (NADA), a novel congestion control approach for
       interactive real-time media applications, such as video conferencing.
       In the proposed scheme, the sender regulates its sending rate based
       on either implicit or explicit congestion signaling, in a unified
       approach. The scheme can benefit from explicit congestion
       notification (ECN) markings from network nodes. It also maintains
       consistent sender behavior in the absence of such markings, by
       reacting to queuing delays and packet losses instead.
    
       We present here the overall system architecture, recommended
       behaviors at the sender and the receiver, as well as expected network
       node operations. Results from extensive simulation studies of the
       proposed scheme are available upon request.

  "Stateful PCE extensions for MPLS-TE LSPs", Edward Crabbe, Jan Medved,
  Ina Minei, Robert Varga, 10-May-13,
  <draft-crabbe-pce-stateful-pce-mpls-te-01.txt>

    The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
       mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
       computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
    
       [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to
       provide stateful control.  This document describes the objects and
       TLVs to be used with these PCEP extensions to control Multiprotocol
       Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
       LSP) via a stateful PCE.

  "A workaround for termination of IPv4 network services", Hiroaki
  Hazeyama, Atsushi Onoe, Osamu Nakamura, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-hiromi-sunset4-termination-ipv4-01.txt>

    After sun-setting of IPv4, many devices will be connected to IPv6
       single stack network. In this document we describe a workaround for
       IPv6 enabled network configuration. At this moment, the condition of
       IPv6 adoption on the consumer devices such as PC, tablet, mobile
       terminal and entertainment device are various. For example, some
       devices are fully support IPv6 client but some are not. It is very
       hard to provide IPv6 network service with these various conditioned
       devices. To solve this problem, we tried to verify some
       configurations to connect these devices into IPv6 enabled consumer
       network for termination of IPv4 network services.

  "I-PAKE: Identity-Based Password Authenticated Key Exchange", Taekyoung
  Kwon, Hyojin Yoon, Sang Kim, 3-May-13,
  <draft-kwon-yoon-kim-ipake-01.txt>

    Although password authentication is the most widespread user
       authentication method today, cryptographic protocols for mutual
       authentication and key agreement, i.e., password authenticated key
       exchange (PAKE), in particular authenticated key exchange (AKE) based
       on a password only, are not actively used in the real world. This
       document introduces a quite novel form of PAKE protocols that employ
       a particular concept of ID-based encryption (IBE). The resulting
       cryptographic protocol is the ID-based password authenticated key
       exchange (I-PAKE) protocol which is a secure and efficient PAKE
       protocol in both soft- and hard-augmented models. I-PAKE achieves the
       security goals of AKE, PAKE, and hard-augmented PAKE. I-PAKE also
       achieves the great efficiency by allowing the whole pre-computation
       of the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman public keys by both server and
       client.

  "Domain Name Registration Data (DNRD) Comma-Separated Values (CSV)
  Objects Mapping", James Gould, Chethan Thippeswamy, 26-Mar-13,
  <draft-gould-thippeswamy-dnrd-csv-mapping-03.txt>

    This document specifies the format and contents of Data Escrow
       deposits for the standard set of Domain Name Registration Data (DNRD)
       objects including domain, host, contact, and registrar using XML for
       definition and Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files for data.

  "Reducing Power Consumption using BGP path selection", Shankar Raman,
  Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Vasan Srini, 26-Mar-13,
  <draft-mjsraman-panet-bgp-power-path-02.txt>

    In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
       consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between
       Autonomous Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS
       and then use suitable modifications to the BGP path selection
       algorithm to route the packets along the paths. Such low-power paths
       can be identified by using the consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth
       (PWR) ratio as an additional parameter in the BGP Path Selection
       Algorithm. For re-routing the data traffic through these low-power
       paths, the power based best path is selected and advertised as per
       the modified algorithm proposed in this document. Extensions to the
       Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) can be used to disseminate the PWR
       ratio metric among the AS thereby creating a collaborative approach
       to reduce the power consumption. The feasibility of our approaches is
       illustrated by applying our algorithm to a subset of the Internet.
       The techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-AS power
       reduction require minimal modifications to the existing features of
       the Internet. The proposed techniques can be extended to other levels
       of Internet hierarchy, such as Intra-AS paths, through suitable
       modifications. A recent addition is the use of this method in AIGP
       domains and also the use of power source data in the calculation of
       low power paths using the BGP path selection algorithm.

  "Reducing Power Consumption using BGP", Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat,
  Gaurav Raina, 26-Mar-13, <draft-mjsraman-panet-inter-as-psp-02.txt>

    In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
       consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between
       Autonomous Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS
       and then use Traffic Engineering (TE) techniques to route the packets
       along the paths. Such low-power paths can be identified by using the
       consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth (PWR) ratio as an additional
       constraint in the Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm.
       For re-routing the data traffic through these low-power paths, the
       Inter-AS Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans
       multiple AS can be used. Extensions to the Border Gateway Protocol
       (BGP) can be used to disseminate the PWR ratio metric among the AS
       thereby creating a collaborative approach to reduce the power
       consumption. Since calculating the low-power paths can be
       computationally intensive, a graph-labeling heuristic is also
       proposed. This heuristic reduces the computational complexity but may
       provide a sub-optimal low-power path. The feasibility of our
       approaches is illustrated by applying our algorithm to a subset of
       the Internet. The techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-AS
       power reduction require minimal modifications to the existing
       features of the Internet. The proposed techniques can be extended to
       other levels of Internet hierarchy, such as Intra-AS paths, through
       suitable modifications.

  "Building power shortest inter-Area TE LSPs using pre-computed paths",
  Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, 3-May-13,
  <draft-mjsraman-panet-intra-as-psp-te-leak-01.txt>

    In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
       consumption of an Autonomous System (AS) using a collaborative
       approach between areas within an AS. We identify the low-power paths
       within non-backbone areas and then use Traffic Engineering (TE)
       techniques to route the packets along the stitched paths from non-
       backbone areas / backbone area to other non-backbone areas. Such low-
       power paths can be identified by using the power-to-available-
       bandwidth (PWR) ratio as an additional constraint in the Constrained
       Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm. For routing the data traffic
       through these low-power paths, the Inter-Area Traffic Engineered
       Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans multiple areas can be used.
       Extensions to the Interior Gateway Protocols like OSPF and IS-IS that
       support TE extensions can be used to disseminate information about
       low-power paths in the respective areas (backbone or non-backbone)
       that minimize the PWR ratio metric on the links within the areas and
       between the areas thereby creating a collaborative approach to reduce
       the power consumption.
    
       The feasibility of our approaches is illustrated by applying our
       algorithm to an AS with a backbone area and several non-backbone
       areas. The techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-Area power
       reduced paths require a few modifications to the existing features of
       the IGPs supporting TE extensions. The proposed techniques can be
       extended to other levels of Internet hierarchy, such as Inter-AS
       paths, through suitable modifications as in [11].
    
       When link state routing protocols like OSPF or ISIS are used to
       discover TE topology, there is the limitation that traffic engineered
       paths can be set up only when the head and tail end of the label
       switched path are in the same area. There are solutions to overcome
       this limitation either using offline Path Computation Engine (PCE)
       that attach to multiple areas and know the topology of all areas.
       This document proposes an alternative approach that does not require
       any centralized PCE and uses selective leaking of low-power TE path
       information from one area into other areas.

  "Power Based Topologies and TE-Shortest Power Paths in OSPF", Shankar
  Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Vasan Srini, 27-Mar-13,
  <draft-mjsraman-panet-ospf-power-topo-02.txt>

    In a Interior Gateway Protocol like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
       the computation of the Constrained shortest path to destinations is
       computed for an area say a backbone or a non-backbone area using the
       TE-metrics advertised in the area. With importance given to the
       reduction of power within a network it becomes important to provide a
       solution that reduces the power consumed amongst routers and links
       that make up the network (in this case an area or a collection of
       areas including the backbone and non-backbone areas). This proposal
       aims at providing such a solution by producing a power topology of
       the area / areas. This power topology is constructed by assigning
       metrics to links based on the power consumed by the linecards (and
       hence their respective ports in an indirect way) of adjacent routers
       that are interconnected by each such link.

  "TCAM power reduction and optimization in Routers", Shankar Raman,
  Balaji Venkat, Kamakoti Veezhinathan, Gaurav Raina, 4-May-13,
  <draft-mjsraman-panet-tcam-power-efficiency-02.txt>

    This specification entails enabling power and performance management
       in Routers (multi-chassis and single chassis) with respect to TCAM
       and SRAM usage on intelligent router line cards  that implement
       Virtual Aggregation of routes.
    
       The version 00 of this document had several errata that have been
       addressed in this version. This scheme relates to unicast alone since
       multicast entries are programmed only after consultation with the
       unicast entries in the software plane in the Route processor. Hence
       this scheme does not apply to multicast.

  "The SignPuddle Standard for SignWriting Text", Stephen Slevinski,
  9-May-13, <draft-slevinski-signwriting-text-01.txt>

    For concreteness, because the universal character set is not yet
       universal, and because an international standard for the internet
       community should be documented and stable, this I-D has been released
       with the intention of producing an RFC to document the character use
       and naming conventions of the SignWriting community on the Internet.
    
       The SignWriting Script is an international standard for writing sign
       languages by hand or with computers.  From education to research,
       from entertainment to religion, SignWriting has proven useful because
       people are using it to write signed languages.  The SignWriting
       Script has two major families: Block Printing for the reader and
       Handwriting for the writer.  The script encoding model presented in
       this document evolved from the Block Printing half of the SignWriting
       Script.
    
       The SignWriting Text encoding model encompasses the Block Printing
       family of the SignWriting Script.  The plain text model for the
       mathematical names has been stable since January 12th, 2012.  The
       visual image can be SVG generated on the server or created with an
       experimental TrueType Font.  The coded character sets and character
       encoding forms are documented with regular expressions.
    
       The ad hoc graphemes of informal SignWriting were first created in
       1974.  Ad hoc graphemes are still used in the handwriting family.
       The standardized symbols of computerized Block Printing text began in
       1986.  After several generations of writers and standardized
       symbolsets, the ISWA 2010 has been optimized and refined as a 16-bit
       coded character set with several isomorphic encodings based on an
       ordered hierarchy with 6 degrees of significance.  The International
       SignWriting Alphabet 2010 is a mathematical symbolset that has been
       stable since its initial release on May 11th, 2010.
    
       The SignPuddle Standard for SignWriting Text is an open and freely
       available encoding model for sign language as text.  The licenses
       include the Open Font License for the fonts, Creative Commons by-sa
       (Attribution, Share Alike) for the documentation, and the GPL for the
       software implementation.  The technological infrastructure continues
       to expand and should be fully realized by the time this I-D has
       become an RFC.  SignPuddle Online contains almost 1 million examples
       of 2-dimensional signs written by the internet community.  Each
       logogram has a mathematical name which describes the freeform
       placement of the symbols.  These strings are the written record of
       the sign.  This standard and emerging infrastructure are used for the
       sign language Wikipedia project on Wikimedia Labs.  This standard is
       being integrated with the SignTyp linguistic coding system developed
       by Rachel Channon through an NSF grant.  This standard was the origin
       for the alternate Unicode proposals.
    
       For Unicode, the current use of the Private Use Area font characters
       is documented.  The state of the TrueType Font is explained.  A
       character proposal for plane 1 is included that is isomorphic with
       the characters that are currently used by the community.
    
       Three appendices discuss additional topics to the standard.  The
       first discusses the Modern SignWriting theory and example document,
       stable since January 12, 2012.  The second discusses the founding
       principles of Cartesian SignWriting: a script encoding model for
       SignWriting Block Printing.  The third discusses a common framework
       for written sign language grammar.
    
       This memo concretely defines a conceptual character encoding map for
       the Internet community.  It is published for reference, examination,
       implementation, and evaluation.  Distribution of this memo is
       unlimited.

  "Textual Representation of IPFIX Abstract Data Types", Brian Trammell,
  22-May-13, <draft-trammell-ipfix-text-adt-01.txt>

    This document defines UTF-8 representations for IPFIX abstract data
       types, to support interoperable usage of the IPFIX Information
       Elements with protocols based on textual encodings.

  "Attacks on Cryptographic Hashes in Internet Protocols", Paul Hoffman,
  Bruce Schneier, 29-Apr-13, <draft-hoffman-schneier-4270bis-02.txt>

    Announcements in the past decade of better-than-expected collision
       attacks in popular hash algorithms have caused some people to
       question whether common Internet protocols need to be changed, and if
       so, how.  This document summarizes the use of hashes in many
       protocols, discusses how the collision attacks affect and do not
       affect the protocols, shows how to thwart known attacks on digital
       certificates, and discusses future directions for protocol designers.
       It also gives rationales for moving away from some hash algorithms
       altogether and for choosing when to start using newer, presumably
       better, hash algorithms in Internet protocols.
    
       This document obsoletes RFC 4270 and introduces significant new
       material that has been learned since the publication of that
       document.

  "ICN Baseline Scenarios and Evaluation Methodology", Kostas Pentikousis,
  Borje Ohlman, Daniel Corujo, Gennaro Boggia, Gareth Tyson, Elwyn Davies,
  Dorothy Gellert, Priya Mahadevan, Spiros Spirou, Antonella Molinaro,
  18-Jun-13, <draft-pentikousis-icn-scenarios-03.txt>

    This document aims at establishing a common understanding about
       potential experimental setups where different information-centric
       networking (ICN) approaches can be tested and compared against each
       other while showcasing their advantages.  Towards this end, we review
       the ICN literature and document scenarios which have been considered
       in previous performance evaluation studies.  The scenarios presented
       aim to exercise a variety of aspects that an ICN solution can
       address. On the one hand, we consider general aspects, such as,
       network efficiency, reduced complexity, increased scalability and
       reliability, mobility support, multicast and caching performance,
       real-time communication efficacy, energy consumption frugality, and
       disruption and delay tolerance. On the other hand, we focus on ICN-
       specific aspects, such as information security and trust,
       persistence, availability, provenance, and location independence.

  "RPKI validation using a local cache", Tim Bruijnzeels, Carlos Martinez,
  Andrew Newton, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-tbruijnzeels-sidr-validation-local-cache-01.txt>

    This documents specifies validation of rpki using a local cache that
       is independent of any particular retrieval mechanism of the objects
       in this cache.  This is useful because it allows for agility in the
       RPKI to define alternative fetch algorithms and/or multiple
       publication points of RPKI data.

  "Interactions between LFA and RSVP-TE", Stephane Litkowski, Bruno
  Decraene, Clarence Filsfils, Kamran Raza, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-litkowski-rtgwg-lfa-rsvpte-cooperation-01.txt>

    This document defines the behavior of a node supporting Loopfree
       Alternates (LFA) when the node has established RSVP TE tunnels.  It
       first describes the decisions to be made by the LFA mechanism with
       respect to the use of TE tunnels as LFA candidates.  Second, it
       discusses the use of RSVP TE tunnels as a way to complement the LFA
       coverage, illustrating how these technologies can benefit from each
       other.

  "jCal: The JSON format for iCalendar", Philipp Kewisch, Cyrus Daboo,
  Mike Douglass, 18-Mar-13, <draft-kewisch-et-al-icalendar-in-json-02.txt>

    This specification defines "jCal", a JSON format for iCalendar data.

  "Enhancing Location Based IP Services", Ammar Salih, 17-May-13,
  <draft-add-location-to-ipv6-header-01.txt>

    This document describes IP-LOC, a proposed extension to IPv6 header
       which suggests adding optional geo-location field, in order to
       enhance existing geo-location based IP service as well as adding new
       ones.
    
       The current method of determining geo-location of IP traffic is
       through RIR (Regional Internet Registry) database, this information
       is not very accurate as it depends on how the ISP registers its IP
       subnets, that is normally done in a country/city format.
    
       It also assumes that in the future, GPS capability could be added to
       the router itself (just like smart phones) and packet marking and
       classification based on geo-location will be required.
    
       QoS, firewall and routing based on geo-location might also be
       required in the future when mobile routers move from one geo-location
       to another, which has a different policy.

  "Internet International Bank Account Number (IIBAN)", Walter Stanish,
  16-May-13, <draft-stanish-iiban-01.txt>

    An Internet IBAN (IIBAN) identifies an internet-based financial
    endpoint in a manner that is superset-compatible with the existing
    European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS) International Bank
    Account Number (IBAN) standard [ISO13616] and implementation
    recommendations [ECBS].  This document obsoletes draft-iiban-00.

  "NVGRE and VXLAN Encapsulation for L3VPN Extension", Lucy Yong, KuiKe
  Building, 21-May-13, <draft-yong-l3vpn-nvgre-vxlan-encap-01.txt>

    This document specifies NVGRE and VXLAN encapsulation for L3VPN
       Extension. Both NVGRE and VXLAN are originally designed for L2
       overlay. The draft proposes the enhancement on both to allow L3
       overlay completely decoupled from the L2 overlay in terms of
       encoding schema and data processing.

  "RPKI Repository Delta Protocol", Tim Bruijnzeels, Oleg Muravskiy, Bryan
  Weber, 11-Feb-13, <draft-tbruijnzeels-sidr-delta-protocol-01.txt>

    In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), certificate
       authorities publish certificates, including end entity certificates,
       and CRLs to repositories on publication servers.  Relying Parties
       (RP) retrieve the published information from the repository and MAY
       store it in a cache.  This document specifies a delta protocol which
       provides relying parties with a mechanism to query a repository for
       changes, thus enabling the RP to keep its state in sync with the
       repository.

  "DSCP and other packet markings for RTCWeb QoS", Subha Dhesikan, Dan
  Druta, Paul Jones, James Polk, 10-Mar-13,
  <draft-dhesikan-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos-01.txt>

    Many networks, such as service provider and private networks, can
       provide per packet treatments based on Differentiated Services Code
       Points (DSCP) on a per hop basis.  This document provides the
       recommended DSCP values for browsers to use for various classes of
       traffic.

  "Redundant BFD sessions", Marc Binderberger, Nobo Akiya, 7-May-13,
  <draft-mbind-bfd-redundancy-01.txt>

    This document defines a second or "shadow" BFD session to an existing
       "primary" BFD session, providing resiliency against BFD failures that
       are not legitimate.
    
       Scenarios will be discussed on how presence of a shadow BFD session
       will be beneficial in the context of high availability.

  "OAuth Token Introspection", Justin Richer, 1-May-13,
  <draft-richer-oauth-introspection-04.txt>

    This specification defines a method for a client or protected
       resource to query an OAuth authorization server to determine meta-
       information about an OAuth token.

  Reddy, Prashanth Patil, Dan Wing, 28-May-13,
  <draft-boucadair-pcp-nat-reveal-01.txt>

    This document describes how to use PCP to retrieve the identity of a
       host behind a NAT.  Two use cases are discussed and the PCP
       applicability is analyzed.  This document extends PCP with a new
       OpCode called QUERY Opcode.
    
       The proposed mechanism is valid for all NAT flavors including NAT44,
       NAT64 or NPTv6.

  "TRILL Smart Endnodes", Radia Perlman, fangwei hu, Donald Eastlake,
  Kesava Krupakaran, 3-Jan-13, <draft-perlman-trill-smart-endnodes-01.txt>

    This draft addresses the problem of the size and freshness of the
       endnode learning table in access RBridges, by allowing endnodes to
       volunteer for endnode learning and encapsulation/decapsulation. Such
       an endnode is known as a "smart endnode". Only the attached RBridge
       can distinguish a "smart endnode" from a "normal endnode". The smart
       endnode uses the nickname of the attached RBridge, so this solution
       does not consume extra nicknames.

  "Security Assessment of Neighbor Discovery (ND) for IPv6", Fernando
  Gont, 11-Jan-13, <draft-gont-opsec-ipv6-nd-security-01.txt>

    Neighbor Discovery is one of the core protocols of the IPv6 suite,
       and provides in IPv6 similar functions to those provided in the IPv4
       protocol suite by the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and the
       Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).  Its increased flexibility
       implies a somewhat increased complexity, which has resulted in a
       number of bugs and vulnerabilities found in popular implementations.
       This document provides guidance in the implementation of Neighbor
       Discovery, and documents issues that have affected popular
       implementations, in the hopes that the same issues do not repeat in
       other implementations.

  "Enhanced Closed Swarm protocol", Dusan Gabrijelcic, 1-Jun-13,
  <draft-ppsp-gabrijelcic-ecs-01.txt>

    The Enhanced Closed Swarm (ECS) protocol is a distributed access
       control mechanism suitable for usage in Peer-to-Peer content delivery
       systems.  The protocol provides coarse or fine grained authorization
       of peers participating in content distribution.  As a result, only
       authorized peers are allowed to communicate in a swarm.  The protocol
       also provides data confidentiality, integrity and origin
       authentication for application data exchanged among peers.  The
       protocol is simple but flexible enough to enable a range of usage
       scenarios.  In addition to the ECS protocol, this document also
       describes its application in the IETF PPSPP.

  "A Fast-Track way to RFC with Running Code", Stephen Farrell, 6-Jan-13,
  <draft-farrell-ft-03.txt>

    This memo describes an optional, fast-track way to progress a working
       group document to IESG review.  It is provided as a process
       experiment as defined in RFC 3933 for use when working group chairs
       believe that there is running code that implements a working group
       Internet-Draft.  The motivation is to have the IETF process
       explicitly consider running code, consistent with the IETF's overall
       philosophy of running code and rough consensus.
    
       In this process all of working group last call, IETF last call, and
       Area Director review are carried out in the same two week period.
       Only comments that meet IESG Discuss criteria need to be addressed
       during this stage, and authors are required to make any changes
       within two weeks.
    
       This experiment will run for one year.

  "A PCE-based Architecture for Application-based Network Operations",
  Daniel King, Adrian Farrel, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-farrkingel-pce-abno-architecture-03.txt>

    Services such as content distribution, distributed databases, or
       inter-data center connectivity place a set of new requirements on the
       operation of networks.  They need on-demand and application-specific
       reservation of network connectivity, reliability, and resources (such
       as bandwidth) in a variety of network applications (such as point-to-
       point connectivity, network virtualization, or mobile backhaul) and
       in a range of network technologies from packet (IP/MPLS) down to
       optical.  An environment that operates to meet this type of
       requirement is said to have Application-Based Network Operations
       (ABNO).
    
       ABNO brings together several existing technologies for gathering
       information about the resources available in a network, for
       consideration of topologies and how those topologies map to
       underlying network resources, for requesting path computation, and
       for provisioning or reserving network resources.  Thus, ABNO may be
       seen as the use of a toolbox of existing components enhanced with a
       few new elements.  The key component within an ABNO is the Path
       Computation Element (PCE), which can be used for computing paths and
       is further extended to provide policy enforcement capabilities for
       ABNO.
    
       This document describes an architecture and framework for ABNO
       showing how these components fit together.  It provides a cookbook of
       existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and meet the needs
       of the applications.

  "Creating an IETF Working Group Draft", Adrian Farrel, DCrocker,
  28-May-13, <draft-crocker-id-adoption-02.txt>

    The productive output of IETF working groups is documents, as
       mandated by the working group's charter.  When a working group is
       ready to develop a particular document it usually "adopts" it as a
       working group draft.  The document that a working group adopts and
       then develops further is based on initial input at varying levels of
       maturity.  An initial working group draft might be a document already
       in wide use, or it might be a blank sheet, wholly created by the
       working group, or it might represent any level of maturity in
       between.  This document discusses the process of creating formal
       working group drafts that are targeted for publication.

  "AODV Extensions for MANET Clustering", Sanghyun Ahn, Seoul University,
  13-May-13, <draft-ahn-manet-clustering-aodv-01.txt>

    This document describes an extention on AODV [1] so that clustering
       of MANET nodes can be allowed for the improvement of MANET
       scalability. MANET clustering requires some MANET nodes to become
       Cluster Heads (CHs) and each non-CH MANET nodes to belong to any one
       appropriate cluster which is represented by a CH node.In this draft,
       AODV control messages are extended for MANET clustering.

  "Architecture for MANET Clustering", Sanghyun Ahn, Hyogon Kim,
  13-May-13, <draft-ahn-manet-clustering-architecture-01.txt>

    This document describes the architecture for clustering in the MANET
       which can be an efficient communication structure for the case
       when MANET nodes have the tendency of forming groups. In this type of
       MANET, each group of nodes forms a cluster which is represented by a
       cluster head. In this draft, we define the terminology for the MANET
       clustering and the related communication procedure.

  "remoteStorage", Michiel de Jong, F. Kooman, 8-Jun-13,
  <draft-dejong-remotestorage-01.txt>

    This draft describes a protocol by which client-side applications,
        running inside a web browser, can communicate with a data storage
        server that is hosted on a different domain name. This way, the
        provider of a web application need not also play the role of data
        storage provider. The protocol supports storing, retrieving, and
        removing individual documents, as well as listing the contents of an
        individual directory, and access control is based on bearer tokens.

  "Signature Authentication in IKEv2", Tero Kivinen, 16-Apr-13,
  <draft-kivinen-ipsecme-signature-auth-01.txt>

    The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has limited
       support for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
       The current version only includes support for three Elliptic Curve
       groups, and there is fixed hash algorithm tied to each curve.  This
       document generalizes the IKEv2 signature support so it can support
       any signature method supported by the PKIX and also adds signature
       hash algorithm negotiation.  This is generic mechanism, and is not
       limited to ECDSA, but can also be used with other signature
       algorithms.

  "Requirements for Marking SIP Messages to be Logged", Peter Dawes,
  13-Jun-13, <draft-dawes-dispatch-logme-reqs-02.txt>

    SIP networks use signalling monitoring tools to diagnose user
       reported problem and for regression testing if network or client
       software is upgraded.  As networks grow and become interconnected,
       including connection via transit networks, it becomes impractical to
       predict the path that SIP signalling will take between clients, and
       therefore impractical to monitor SIP signalling end-to-end.
    
       This draft describes requirements for adding an indicator to the SIP
       protocol which can be used to mark signalling as of interest to
       logging.  Such marking will typically be applied as part of network
       testing controlled by the network operator and not used in regular
       client signalling.  However, such marking can be carried end-to-end
       including the SIP terminals, even if a session originates and
       terminates in different networks.

  "A DNS Resource Record for Service Descriptions", Eliot Lear, 21-Feb-13,
  <draft-lear-httpbis-svcinfo-rr-01.txt>

    Certain application protocols are highly transactional and require
       substantial care when dealing with latency.  Queries for versioning
       information are, in these circumstances, costly.  In addition, there
       is a desire to allow for a means to specify a lightweight means to
       alternative transport protocols, such as making use of SCTP instead
       of TCP.  This memo specifies a new DNS RR with an eye toward the
       least necessary roundtrips to determine various protocols, port
       numbers, and options for a given service instance.

  "Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology", Scott Bradner, Jorge
  Contreras, 12-Jun-13, <draft-bradner-rfc3979bis-05.txt>

    The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), such as
       patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are
       designed to ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as
       much information about any IPR constraints on a technical proposal as
       possible.  The policies are intended to benefit the Internet
       community and the public at large, while respecting the legitimate
       rights of IPR holders.  This memo details the IETF policies
       concerning IPR related to technology worked on within the IETF.  It
       also describes the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.
       This memo updates RFC 2026 and obsoletes RFC 3979 and RFC 4879.

  "Via header field parameter to indicate received realm", Christer
  Holmberg, Yi Jiang, 14-Jun-13,
  <draft-holmberg-sipcore-received-realm-01.txt>

    This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
       Via header field parameter, "received-realm", which allows a SIP
       entity acting as an entry point to a transit network to indicate from
       which adjacent upstream network a SIP request is received, using a
       network realm value associated with the adjacent network.

  "Compact representation of an elliptic curve point", Andrey Jivsov,
  4-Jun-13, <draft-jivsov-ecc-compact-02.txt,.pdf>

    This document defines a format for efficient storage representation
       of an elliptic curve point over prime fields, suitable for use with
       any IETF format or protocol.

  "JSON Metadata for OAuth Responses 1.0", Mike Kelly, Nat Sakimura,
  12-Feb-13, <draft-sakimura-oauth-meta-02.txt>

    This specification defines an extensible metadata member that may be
       inserted into the OAuth 2.0 responses to assist the clients to
       process those responses.  It is expressed as a member called "_links"
       that is inserted as the top level member in the responses.  It will
       allow the client to learn where the members in the response could be
       used and how, etc.  Since it is just a member, any client that does
       not understand this extension should not break and work normally
       while supporting clients can utilize the metadata to its advantage.

  "Improving Awareness of Running Code: the Implementation Status
  Section", Yaron Sheffer, Adrian Farrel, 2-Jun-13,
  <draft-sheffer-running-code-06.txt>

    This document describes a simple process that allows authors of
       Internet-Drafts to record the status of known implementations by
       including an Implementation Status section.  This will allow
       reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents
       that have the benefit of running code, by considering the running
       code as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that has
       made the implemented protocols more mature.
    
       The process in this document is offered as an experiment.  Authors of
       Internet-Drafts are encouraged to consider using the process for
       their documents, and working groups are invited to think about
       applying the process to all of their protocol specifications.  The
       authors of this document intend to collate experiences with this
       experiment and to report them to the community.

  "Delay Limits and Multiplexing Policies to be employed with Tunneling
  Compressed Multiplexed Traffic Flows", Mirko Suznjevic, Jose Saldana,
  14-Jun-13, <draft-suznjevic-tsvwg-mtd-tcmtf-01.txt,.pdf>

    This document contains recommendations to be taken into account when
       using methods which optimize bandwidth utilization through
       compression, multiplexing, and tunneling traffic flows (TCMTF) over a
       network path.  Different multiplexing policies and implementation
       issues which are service and link specific are discussed.
       Additionally, this document describes policies which can be used for
       detecting, classifying, and choosing the network flows suitable for
       optimization by using TCMTF.  Finally, recommendations of maximum
       tolerable delays to be added by optimization techniques are reported.
       Recommendations are presented only for network services for which
       such bandwidth optimization techniques are applicable (i.e., services
       with low payload to header size ratio, which will also be denoted as
       "small-packet flows").

  "Requirements for Automated (Configuration) Management", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet, 10-Jun-13,
  <draft-boucadair-network-automation-requirements-01.txt>

    Given the ever-increasing complexity of the configuration tasks
       required for the dynamic provisioning of IP networks and services,
       this document aims at listing the requirements to drive the
       specification of an automated configuration management framework,
       including the requirements for a protocol to convey configuration
       information towards the managed entities.

  "Analysis of RSVP-TE Security According to KARP Design Guide", Mahesh
  Jethanandani, Dacheng Zhang, 20-May-13,
  <draft-mahesh-karp-rsvp-te-analysis-01.txt>

    This document analyzes Resource reSerVation Protocol-Traffic
       Engineering (RSVP-TE) according to guidelines set forth in section
       4.2 of KARP Design Guidelines (RFC 6518).

  "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Auxiliary Object Class
  'mailboxRelatedObject'", Michael Stroeder, 28-Jan-13,
  <draft-stroeder-mailboxrelatedobject-01.txt>

    This document defines the auxiliary object class
       'mailboxRelatedObject' that can be used to associate an arbitrary
       object with a RFC 2822 mail address.  Furthermore a attribute
       'intlMailAdr' is defined for internationalized email addresses.

  "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Structural Object Classes
  for Named Objects", Michael Stroeder, 7-Jan-13,
  <draft-stroeder-namedobject-01.txt>

    This document defines structural object classes that can be used when
       no other structural object class seems suitable.  Especially the
       object classes will give the possibility to associate a common name
       and a free-form description with the object.

  "The WebSocket Protocol as a Transport for the Message Session Relay
  Protocol (MSRP)", Peter Dunkley, Gavin Llewellyn, Victor Pascual,
  10-May-13, <draft-pd-dispatch-msrp-websocket-02.txt>

    The WebSocket protocol enables two-way real-time communication
       between clients and servers.  This document specifies a new WebSocket
       sub-protocol as a reliable transport mechanism between MSRP (Message
       Session Relay Protocol) clients and relays to enable usage of MSRP in
       new scenarios.  This document normatively updates RFC 4975 and RFC
       4976.

  "ALTO Server Discovery based on well-known IP Address", Sebastian
  Kiesel, Reinaldo Penno, 27-Dec-12,
  <draft-kiesel-alto-ip-based-srv-disc-01.txt>

    The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
       provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several
       hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired
       resource.  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.
    
       This document establishes a well-known IP address for the ALTO
       service and specifies how ALTO clients embedded in the resource
       consumer can use it to access the ALTO service.

  "A ROA Status Attribute for RPSL Objects", Larry Blunk, 14-Jun-13,
  <draft-blunk-rpsl-roa-01.txt>

    This document describes an attribute for Routing Policy Specification
       Language (RPSL) route and route6 objects that documents the presence
       and validity of a Route Origin Authorization (ROA) for the given
       prefix and origin values contained within the object.  It allows
       parties who employ Internet Routing Registries (IRR's) for routing
       policy configuration generation to easily ascertain whether a given
       object has a ROA covering the object.  The primary objective is to
       enable existing IRR tools to make use of the ROA information with
       minimal modifications.

  "Backup Path for Point-to-Point Routes in Low Power and Lossy Networks",
  Dinh-Sy Do, Ngoc-Thanh Dinh, Young-Han Kim, 18-Jun-13,
  <draft-do-roll-p2p-backup-01.txt>

    In this draft, a backup path setup mechanism is proposed for the
       P2P-RPL protocol in Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). This
       mechanism allows sensor nodes to send packets over the backup path
       without rediscovering the p2p path in case of path failure, thus
       improving the reliability of p2p transmission.

  "Large-Scale Broadband Measurement Use Cases", Marc Linsner, Philip
  Eardley, Trevor Burbridge, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-linsner-lmap-use-cases-02.txt>

    Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important for
       network diagnostics by providers and users, as well for as public
       policy.  To conduct such measurements, user networks gather data,
       either on their own initiative or instructed by a measurement
       controller, and then upload the measurement results to a designated
       measurement server.  Understanding the various scenarios and users of
       measuring broadband performance is essential to development of the
       system requirements.  The details of the measurement metrics
       themselves are beyond the scope of this document.

  "SCIM 2.0 Token Search Extension", Phil Hunt, Kelly Grizzle, Morteza
  Ansari, Dale Olds, 23-Dec-12, <draft-hunt-scim-tokensearch-00.txt>

    The SCIM 2.0 Core API defines a simple profile for searching for
       specific resource types using filters and qualifiers in combination
       with the HTTP GET verb.  The Token Search specification defines the
       following additional features:
    
       o  Specification of search terms within an HTTP POST verb to avoid
          accidental leakage of confidential information via HTTP GET URLs,
    
       o  An optional result set token enabling clients to page through
          results in a state consistent fashion, and
    
       o  The ability to search across multiple resource types (endpoints)
          and return one or more resource types.

  "SCIM 2.0 Extended Search", Phil Hunt, Kelly Grizzle, Morteza Ansari,
  Dale Olds, 23-Dec-12, <draft-hunt-scim-xsearch-00.txt>

    The SCIM 2.0 Core API defines a simple profile for searching for

       o  The ability to search across multiple resource types (endpoints)
          and return one or more resource types.

  "OAuth 2.0 Resource Set Registration", Thomas Hardjono, 27-Dec-12,
  <draft-hardjono-oauth-resource-reg-00.txt>

    This specification defines a resource set registration mechanism
       between an OAuth 2.0 authorization server and resource server.  The
       resource server registers information about the semantics and
       discovery properties of its resources with the authorization server.

  "E164/214 MPBGP announcement", Shu Ge, 28-Dec-12,
  <draft-idr-e164e214-mpbgp-00.txt>

    Recently, transferring the signaling of mobile network over IP
       attracts lots of attention from people.  Telephone number based on
       E.164 or E.214 or SP is the traditional routing address for mobile
       network, but actually, E.164, E.214 and SP is not supported by MP-BGP
       protocol.
    
       This document presents a new way to support for routing the phone
       number based on E.164, E.214 or SP though MP-BGP, by extending the
       MP-BGP for the Phone Number Routing.  It can bring optimizing for the
       network architecture and improving efficiency.

  "JSON Private and Symmetric Key", Michael Jones, 28-Dec-12,
  <draft-jones-jose-json-private-and-symmetric-key-00.txt,.pdf>

    The JSON Private Key specification extends the JSON Web Key (JWK) and
       JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) specifications to define JavaScript Object
       Notation (JSON) representations of private keys and symmetric keys.

  "OCSP-lite - Revocation of raw public keys", Bert Greevenbosch,
  6-Jun-13, <draft-greevenbosch-tls-ocsp-lite-01.txt>

    This document provides an online mechanism for checking the
       revocation status of raw public keys.  The mechanism is based on its
       older brother for X.509 certificates, OCSP.
    
    Note
    
       Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should
       be sent to tls@ietf.org.

  "MN IP Capability for Wifi-EPC Integration", Yangwei Tu, 30-Dec-12,
  <draft-tu-netext-mn-ip-capability-00.txt>

    WiFi is beginning to be considered as a trusted non-3GPP access
       network which can provide the service of accessing to the EPC core
       network to the user.  And EAP/AKA(and EAP/AKA') is specified as the
       access authentication protocol in this case.  This document defines a
       new EAP attribute to provide the mobile node IPv4/IPv6/IPv4v6
       capability to the network so that mobile node IP address/prefix
       assignment and PMIP session establishment can be processed
       accordingly.

  "Encapsulating IP in UDP", KuiKe Building, Lucy Yong, Yiu Lee, Fan
  Yongbing, 19-Feb-13, <draft-xu-softwire-ip-in-udp-01.txt>

    Existing Softwire encapsulation technologies are not adequate for
       efficient load balancing of Softwire service traffic across IP
       networks. This document specifies additional Softwire encapsulation
       technology, referred to as IP-in-User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which
       can facilitate the load balancing of Softwire service traffic across
       IP networks.

  "End-point based Multimedia QoE Management", Bhumip Khasnabish, Gerard
  Fernando, 31-Dec-12, <draft-khasnabish-dispatch-qoe-management-00.txt>

    This draft describes a method for improving the quality of experience
       (QoE) for real-time video and other multimedia services using
       features and functions of the end-point only, that is, without
       requiring any upgrade to the network transport infrastructure.  Any
       upgrade to the network transport infrastructure not only incurs
       significant costs, these are also time consuming and technology-
       dependent.  Therefore, these QoE improvement mechanisms are
       significantly more attractive to both network operators and service
       providers.

  "Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) Session Continuation: Problem
  Statement", Nico Williams, 1-Jan-13,
  <draft-williams-websec-session-continue-prob-00.txt>

    One of the most often talked about problems in web security is
       "cookies".  Web cookies are a method of associating requests with
       "sessions" that may have been authenticated somehow.  Cookies are a
       form of bearer token that leave much to be desired.  This document
       describes the session "continuation" problem for the HyperText
       Transport Protocol (HTTP).

  <draft-asati-dhc-ipv6-autoconfig-address-tracking-00.txt>

    Network operators commonly use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    (DHCP) to assign IP addresses to the hosts, and track them. However,
    the tracking capability is lost when stateless autoconfiguration or
    manual methods are used to assign IPv6 addresses.
    
    This document proposes a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for
    IPv6 (DHCPv6) based mechanism that the last hop router can use to
    convey the hosts' IPv6 addresses for the tracking and logging
    purposes, without requiring any changes to the hosts.

  "TRILL: Support of IEEE 802.1 Priority-based Flow Control and Enhanced
  Transmission Selection", Donald Eastlake, Manoj Wadekar, Anoop Ghanwani,
  Puneet Agarwal, Tal Mizrahi, 3-Jan-13,
  <draft-eastlake-trill-pfc-ets-00.txt>

    This document briefly explains the IEEE 802.1 Priority-based Flow
       Control and Enhanced Transmission standards and discusses the support
       of these standards in TRILL switches (devices that implement the IETF
       TRILL protocol standard).

  "Pausing an RTP Media Stream", Roni Even, 3-Jan-13,
  <draft-even-flow-control-to-zero-00.txt>

    In Real-time multimedia applications using multiple media streams in
       point to point and multipoint calls can benefit from options that
       will enable them to pause and resume media streams as well as to
       indicate a mute state.  This document describes the difference
       between pause and mute and describes how to provide this required
       functionality.  This document updates RFC5104.

  "Self-published IP Geolocation Data", Erik Kline, Krzysztof Duleba,
  Zoltan Szamonek, 16-May-13,
  <draft-google-self-published-geofeeds-01.txt>

    This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish
       a mapping of IP address ranges to simplified geolocation information,
       colloquially termed a geolocation "feed".  Interested parties can
       poll and parse these feeds to update or merge with other geolocation
       data sources and procedures.
    
       Some technical organizations operating networks that move from one
       conference location to the next have already experimentally published
       small geolocation feeds.  At least one consumer (Google) has
       incorporated these ad hoc feeds into a geolocation data pipeline.

  "Update Attribute Flag Low Bits Clarification", Susan Hares, John

       support importation of ABNF from other documents, and multiple naming
       scopes for rulenames.

  "A Simple Secure Address Generation Scheme for IPv6 AutoConfiguration
  (SSAS)",  Hosnieh, Christoph Meinel, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-rafiee-6man-ssas-04.txt>

    The default method for IPv6 address generation uses an
       Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) assigned by the IEEE
       Standards Association and an Extension Identifier assigned to the
       hardware manufacturer [1] (section 2.5.1 RFC-4291) [RFC4291]. This
       fact thus means that a node will always have the same Interface ID
       (IID) whenever it connects to a new network. Because the node's IP
       address does not change, the node will be vulnerable to privacy
       related attacks. Currently this problem is addressed by the use of
       two mechanisms that do not make use of the MAC address, or other
       unique values that can be used for ID generation, for randomizing the
       IID; Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] and
       Privacy Extension [RFC4941]. The problem with the former approach is
       the computational cost involved for the IID generation and in the
       verification process. The problem with the latter approach is that it
       lacks necessary security mechanisms and provides the node with only
       partial protection against privacy related attacks. This document
       proposes the use of a new algorithm for use in the generation of the
       IID while, at the same time, securing the node against some types of
       attack, like IP spoofing. These attacks are prevented by the addition
       of a signature to messages sent over the network and by direct use of
       a public key in the IP address.

  "TRILL: Support of IEEE 802.1 Congestion Notification", Donald Eastlake,
  Manoj Wadekar, Anoop Ghanwani, Puneet Agarwal, Tal Mizrahi, 4-Jan-13,

       standard and specifies the support of this standard in TRILL switches
       (devices that implement the IETF TRILL protocol standard). It updates
       RFC 6325.

  "Computing Power Saving Paths using TCAM Power Ratio", Shankar Raman,
  Balaji Venkat, Kamakoti Veezhinathan, 2-Feb-13,
  <draft-mjsraman-panet-tcam-power-ratio-02.txt>

    A power saving scheme for switching of TCAM banks of fine granularity
       is discussed in [ID-TCAM-POWER-EFF]. This scheme switches of TCAM
       banks of fine granularity and their corresponding SRAM banks
       depending on the occupancy of routes and their rewrites within the
       TCAM of a intelligent router line card (where one or more such TCAM
       entities along with their SRAM banks may reside) by using an
       algorithm specified in [ID-TCAM-POWER-EFF]. This takes care of
       switching off TCAM and SRAM banks within a router's line card and
       correspondingly saves power when the traffic matrix is not large with
       respect to the routes the packets lookup where the occupancy of such
       routes is low in the line card. This is with reference to both single
       and multi-chassis devices. The algorithm specified therein tends to
       switch off banks which are not in use. The aim of this draft is to
       use the device level characteristic in the form of a TCAM Power Ratio
       and disseminate it as a metric within an area or an Autonomous system
       (where multiple such areas exist within an AS) to compute power
       saving paths through the set of routers where the TCAM-POWER-RATIO is
       low. The TCAM-POWER-RATIO is arrived at by dividing the number of
       bits in the TCAM banks that are switched off by the Total Available
       TCAM bank space in bits. This ratio is then subjected to the CSPF
       algorithm as an additional constraint or the only constraint as the
       case may be in a link state protocol like OSPF or IS-IS with Traffic
       Engineering Extensions with available utilization on the links also
       being a factor. This way those routers that have more TCAM banks
       switched off are avoided and those with higher power consumption but
       with available bandwidth are used hence not increasing the total
       power consumed within the area and hence within the AS. This could be
       achieved by using a PCE like entity that calculates the power
       shortest paths using this TCAM-POWER-RATIO.

    This document describes a protocol extension in TRILL IS-IS and a
       parent selection tiebreak algorithm in the calculation of
       distribution trees in TRILL. The proposal is to modify the current
       algorithm to improve the stability of the distribution trees when
       multiple equal cost parents are present. It also offers the
       capabilities of pinning down multi-destination traffic and re-shaping
       the distribution tree to improve the traffic load splitting.

  "The problem statement of RBridge edge group state synchronization", Hao
  Weiguo, Li Yizhou, 15-Jan-13, <draft-hao-trill-rb-syn-00.txt>

    In TRILL multi-homing scenario, the concept of virtual RBridge in
       [TRILLPN], was introduced to address the MAC flip-flopping problem
       at remote RBridges. Based on virtual RBridge mechanism, Coordinated
       Multicast Trees (CMT) solution in [CMT] was introduced to solve the
       related RPF issues. In this document, additional problems are
       described regarding virtual Bridges members' state synchronization
       in multi-homing scenario, including virtual RBridge membership auto
       discovery, pseudo-nickname static configuration consistency check,
       dynamic pseudo-nickname allocation, CMT configuration
       synchronization ,LACP configuration and state synchronization, and
       node/link failure detection. To address these problems, a
       communication protocol among members of a virtual RBridge group
       should be provided. Requirements for this protocol is also discussed.

  "IMAP $Important Keyword and \Important Special-Use Attribute", Barry
  Leiba, Eric Iceman, 15-Apr-13,
  <draft-iceman-imap-specialuse-important-02.txt>

    RFC 6154 created an IMAP Special-Use LIST extension and defined an
       initial set of attributes.  This document defines a new attribute,
       "\Important", and establishes a new IANA registry for IMAP folder
       attributes, registering the attributes defined in RFCs 3348, 3501,
       and 6154.  This document also defines a new IMAP keyword,
       "$Important", and registers it in the registry defined in RFC 5788.

  "Email transfer in the IPv6 introduction phase", Martin Rosenau,
  16-Jan-13, <draft-mrosenau-email-ipv4-to-6-00.txt>

    During the introduction phase of IPv6 (as of Jan 2013) many existing
       mail servers are not able to do IPv6 communication, yet.  However new
       networks will be assigned IPv6 addresses only so new mail servers
       will not be able to do IPv4 communication.
    
       This document proposes the installation of special servers that are
       able to route mail between IPv4-only and IPv6-only mail servers to
       solve this problem.

  "PLASMA and Redacted Documents", Jim Schaad, 16-Jan-13,
  <draft-schaad-plasma-redact-00.txt>

    Redacted documents are designed to have a single document which
       allows different individuals to view different portions of the
       document basd on the attributes of the individual.  In this document,
       a protocol extension to the basic PLASMA protocol is described that
       allows for multiple keys, each with a different policy, to be used in
       a single electronic document for enforcement of redaction levels.
       This document is agnostic relative to the actual format of the
       redacted document, the only requirement being that the redacted
       document be able to carry the PLASMA defined lock box.

  "Unanswered Questions in the Path Computation Element Architecture",
  Adrian Farrel, Daniel King, 28-Apr-13,
  <draft-farrkingel-pce-questions-03.txt>

    The Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture is set out in RFC
       4655. The architecture is extended for multi-layer networking with
       the introduction of the Virtual Network Topology Manager in RFC
       5623, and generalized to Hierarchical PCE in RFC 6805.
    
       These three architectural views of PCE deliberately leave some key
       questions unanswered especially with respect to the interactions
       between architectural components.  This document draws out those
       questions and discusses them in an architectural context with
       reference to other architectural components, existing protocols, and
       recent IETF work efforts.
    
       This document does not update the architecture documents and does not
       define how protocols or components must be used.  It does, however,
       suggest how the architectural components might be combined to provide
       advanced PCE function.

  "Autonomous Extensible Internet with Network Address Multiplexing(AEIP
  NAM)", Yuping Diao, Diao Yongping, Ming Liao, 18-Jan-13,
  <draft-diao-aeip-nam-00.txt>

    The two key issues of today's Internet are autonomy and
       extensibility. Autonomous Internet(AIP) technology can provide
       extensible internet architecture, own independent root DNS servers
       and self management internet network; Furthermore, based on the
       Autonomous Internet, here provides a way with extensible address
       capacity to solve IP address deficiency and realize
       Autonomous Extensible Internet(AEIP) with global network address
       and multiplexing local network address. This AEIP with Network
       Address Multiplexing(AEIP NAM) can realize autonomy and extensibility
       with minimal cost.

  "Flow-state dependent packet selection techniques", ramki, So Ning,
  18-Jun-13, <draft-krishnan-ipfix-flow-aware-packet-sampling-05.txt>

    The demands on the networking infrastructure and thus the
       switch/router bandwidths are growing exponentially; the drivers are
       bandwidth hungry rich media applications, inter data center
       communications etc. Using sampling techniques, for a given sampling
       rate, the amount of samples that need to be processed is increasing
       exponentially especially for applications like security threat
       detection. This draft elaborates on flow-state dependent packet
       selection techniques and the relevant information models. It
       describes how these techniques can be effectively used to reduce the
       number of samples for applications like security threat detection.

  "The TPMKEY URI Scheme", Carolin Latze, Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos,
  25-Jan-13, <draft-mavrogiannopoulos-tpmuri-01.txt>

    This memo specifies a TPMKEY Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Scheme
       for identifying cryptographic keys stored in TPM chips and accessed
       using the TCG Software Stack (TSS).  The URI is based on how TPM keys
       are identified in the TSS specification.

  "Coupled congestion control for RTP media", Michael Welzl, Safiqul
  Islam, Stein Gjessing, 14-Jun-13, <draft-welzl-rmcat-coupled-cc-01.txt>

    When multiple congestion controlled RTP sessions traverse the same
       network bottleneck, it can be beneficial to combine their controls
       such that the total on-the-wire behavior is improved.  This document
       describes such a method for flows that have the same sender, in a way
       that is as flexible and simple as possible while minimizing the
       amount of changes needed to existing RTP applications.

  "Key Relay Mapping for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol", R. Gieben,
  M. Groeneweg, Rik Ribbers, Antoin Verschuren, 3-Apr-13,
  <draft-gieben-epp-keyrelay-02.txt>

    This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
       extension mapping for the purpose of relaying DNSSEC key material
       from one DNS operator to another, by using the administrative
       registration channel through the registrant, registrar and registry.
       The mapping introduces "<keyrelay>" as a new command in EPP.
    
       This command will help facilitate changing the DNS operator of a
       domain while keeping the DNSSEC chain of trust intact.

  "Writing I-Ds and RFCs using Pandoc", R. Gieben, 10-Apr-13,

  "ZSS Short Signature Scheme for BN Curves", Laura Hitt, 11-Feb-13,
  <draft-hitt-zssbn-01.txt>

    This document describes the ZSS Short Signature Scheme for
       implementation from bilinear pairings on Barreto-Naerhig (BN)
       ordinary elliptic curves. The ZSS Short Signature Scheme uses general
       cryptographic hash functions such as SHA-1 or SHA-2 and is efficient
       in terms of pairing operations.

  "VPOLL: Consensus Scheduling Component for iCalendar", Eric York, Cyrus
  Daboo, Mike Douglass, 22-Jan-13, <draft-york-vpoll-00.txt,.pdf>

    This specification introduces a new iCalendar component which allows
       for consensus scheduling, that is voting on a number of alternative
       meeting or task alternatives.

  "New Performance Metrics Framework for Multiparty Services", Tiziano
  Ionta, 23-Jan-13, <draft-ionta-multiparty-metrics-framework-00.txt>

    One of the best chances for a Service Provider to face the complex
    growth of IP Services, and their challenging requirements/SLAs along
    the Core network, is to enrich the current Performance metrics - mainly
    derived from a "Network-Oriented point of view", and therefore a
    general perspective, not focused on specific services - with some more
    Performance factors, so to include a "Service-Oriented point of view",
    more centred on the particular kind of service, with its own
    characteristics in terms of protocol, application, manageability, and
    so on.
    Almost nothing about this new approach has been standardized yet for
    the core network.
    To achieve the above goal, and starting from the one-to-group
    performance metrics outlined in RFC 5644 [RFC5644], a new metrics
    composition/aggregation framework is proposed in this memo, where the
    main focus is on multiparty communications (e.g. video providers,
    online biding, online stock market, etc.).
    Finally this memo is tuned to RFC 6390 [RFC6390] in terms of scopes,
    framework concepts, and need to widen the current performance metrics
    depending on the application, service etc.

  "Pausing an RTP Media Stream", Roni Even, 24-Jan-13,
  <draft-even-avtext-flow-control-to-zero-00.txt>

    In Real-time multimedia applications using multiple media streams in
       point to point and multipoint calls can benefit from options that
       will enable them to pause and resume media streams as well as to
       indicate a mute state.  This document describes the difference
       between pause and mute and describes how to provide this required
       functionality.  This document updates RFC5104.

  "A mechanism to allocate IPv6 blocks for BGP networks based on the
  networks AS Number", Martin Levy, Matthew Pounsett, 24-Jan-13,
  <draft-mlevy-v6ops-auto-v6-allocation-per-asn-00.txt>

    This document provides a methodology for automatically allocating
       IPv6 [RFC2460] address blocks for networks that run BGP [RFC4271] and
       are either single-homed or multi-homed [BARBER2011].  The automatic
       allocation is taken from a specific /16 block assigned by IANA for
       this purpose.
    
       Networks that require more than this single /48 can still request
       additional allocations via the existing RIR process.  Networks are
       not forced to use this allocation and can ignore this completely.
       Availability of the /48 assignment via this mechanism does not change
       existing mechanisms for obtaining IPv6 assignments through the
       existing RIR (Regional Internet Registry) or LIR (Local Internet
       Registry) mechanisms.
    
       There is an implicit assumption that it's a good thing to promote
       networks to enable IPv6 with a near-zero effort.

  "Objectclass property for vCard", Ciny Joy, Cyrus Daboo, Mike Douglass,
  24-Jan-13, <draft-vcard-objectclass-00.txt,.pdf>

    This specification describes a new property for vCard Format
       Specification [RFC6350] to allow the specification of objectclasses.

  "Schedulable Objectclass for vCard", Ciny Joy, Cyrus Daboo, Mike
  Douglass, 24-Jan-13, <draft-vcard-schedulable-00.txt,.pdf>

    This specification describes a new property objectclass value for the
       vcard objectclass property defined in [REF] allowing schedulable
       entities to be marked as such.

  "Hybrid Unicast/Multicast DNS-Based Service Discovery", Stuart Cheshire,
  26-Jan-13, <draft-cheshire-mdnsext-hybrid-01.txt>

    Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely Multicast DNS
       allows discovery only of services present on the local link.  Using a
       very large local link with thousands of hosts improves service
       discovery, but at the cost of large amounts of multicast traffic.
    
       Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely Unicast DNS is
       more efficient, but requires configuration of DNS Update keys on the
       devices offering the services, which can be onerous for simple
       devices like printers and network cameras.
    
       Hence a compromise is needed, that provides easy service discovery
       without requiring either large amounts of multicast traffic or
       onerous configuration.

  "Registration Data Access Protocol Basic Search Processing", Scott
  Hollenbeck, Andrew Newton, 18-Jun-13,
  <draft-hollenbeck-weirds-rdap-search-02.txt>

    This document describes path segments and query parameters needed to
       construct HTTP URLs that may be used to search for and retrieve
       registration information from registries (including both Regional
       Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs)) using
       "RESTful" web access patterns.  It also describes a method of
       encoding responses using Javascript Object Notation (JSON).

  "Asymmetric OSPF Hold Timer", Madhukar Anand, Hasmit Grover, Abhay Roy,
  16-Jun-13, <draft-madhukar-ospf-agr-asymmetric-01.txt>

    Current OSPF standard requires that the HELLO/Dead interval be
       symmetric on either side of the link in order to maintain adjacency.
       There are many scenarios in which this may not be desirable. This
       memo describes a technique to allow OSPF adjacency to be maintained
       with asymmetric values of the OSPF Dead interval.

  "Selection of Future Cryptographic Standards", David McGrew, Anthony
  Grieco, Yaron Sheffer, 25-Jan-13, <draft-mcgrew-standby-cipher-00.txt>

    The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is extensively used and is
       widely believed to provide security that is more than adequate.
       Several other cipher designs have been proposed for use in standards,
       and new designs continue to be developed, while consideration of cost
       and complexity impels that the number of mandatory-to-implement
       ciphers be minimized.  This note outlines an approach to the
       selection of cryptographic algorithms that best serves the needs of
       the users of cryptography: AES should continue in its role as the
       mandatory-to-implement cipher, while other cipher designs should be
       reviewed with the goal of selecting a single standby cipher.  If
       future advances in the science of cryptanalysis uncover security
       issues with the AES, the standby cipher will be ready for adoption as
       its replacement.

  "Reducing Power Consumption using BGP with power source data", Shankar
  Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Kamakoti Veezhinathan, 25-Jan-13,
  <draft-mjsraman-panet-inter-as-power-source-00.txt>

    In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
       consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between
       Autonomous Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS
       and then use Traffic Engineering (TE) techniques to route the packets
       along the paths. Such low-power paths can be identified by using the
       consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth (PWR) ratio as an additional
       constraint in the Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm.
       For re-routing the data traffic through these low-power paths, the
       Inter-AS Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans
       multiple AS can be used. Extensions to the Border Gateway Protocol
       (BGP) can be used to disseminate the PWR ratio metric among the AS
       thereby creating a collaborative approach to reduce the power
       consumption. Since calculating the low-power paths can be
       computationally intensive, a graph-labeling heuristic is also
       proposed. This heuristic reduces the computational complexity but may
       provide a sub-optimal low-power path. The feasibility of our
       approaches is illustrated by applying our algorithm to a subset of
       the Internet. The techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-AS
       power reduction require minimal modifications to the existing
       features of the Internet. The proposed techniques can be extended to
       other levels of Internet hierarchy, such as Intra-AS paths, through
       suitable modifications. The addition to this draft is that the power
       source of the Autonomous system is broken down to a ratio called PWR-
       SOURCE Ratio and used in the arrival of the metric to be used for
       this purpose.

  "The Use of MPLS Special Purpose Labels for the Computation of Load
  Balancing", Carlos Pignataro, Loa Andersson, Kireeti Kompella,
  16-Feb-13, <draft-pignataro-mpls-reserved-labels-lb-01.txt>

    In addition to being used for forwarding, an MPLS label stack may
       also be used as an entropy source to perform load balancing
       computation in various ways.  RFC 4928 and RFC 6790 describe this
       mechanism in great detail.  However, those two RFCs differ in the use
       of MPLS special purpose labels (previously referred to as "reserved
       labels") for computation of load balancing.  This document addresses
       this difference in specifications by providing a more comprehensive
       set of recommendations.
    
       This document updates RFC 4928 and RFC 6790.

  "Balanced Security for IPv6 CPE", Martin Gysi, Guillaume Leclanche, Eric
  Vyncke, Ragnar Anfinsen, 25-Jan-13,
  <draft-v6ops-vyncke-balanced-ipv6-security-00.txt>

    This document describes how an IPv6 residential Customer Premise
       Equipment (CPE) can have a balanced security policy that allows for a
       mostly end-to-end connectivity while keeping the major threats
       outside of the home.  It is based on an actual IPv6 deployment by
       Swisscom and proposes to allow all packets inbound/outbound EXCEPT
       for some layer-4 ports where attacks and vulnerabilities (such as
       weak passwords) are well-known.

  "Binding Obligations on User-Managed Access (UMA) Participants", Eve
  Maler, Thomas Hardjono, 26-Jan-13, <draft-maler-oauth-umatrust-00.txt>

    User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0.  UMA defines how
       resource owners can control protected-resource access by clients
       operated by arbitrary requesting parties, where the resources reside
       on any number of resource servers, and where a centralized
       authorization server governs access based on resource owner policy.
       This document provides a contractual framework that defines the
       minimum obligations of parties that operate and use UMA-conforming
       software programs and services.  The goal of this framework is to
       support end-to-end legal enforceability of the terms and conditions
       of access sharing relationships between authorizing and requesting
       sides that use UMA.  The audience for this document includes
       technologists, legal professionals, and operators of UMA-conforming
       services.

  "Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive
  Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol", Emil Ivov, Eric Rescorla,
  Justin Uberti, 11-Mar-13, <draft-ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice-01.txt>

    This document describes an extension to the Interactive Connectivity
       Establishment (ICE) protocol that allows ICE agents to send and
       receive candidates incrementally rather than exchanging complete
       lists.  With such incremental provisioning, ICE agents can begin
       connectivity checks while they are still gathering candidates and
       considerably shorten the time necessary for ICE processing to
       complete.
    
       The above mechanism is also referred to as "trickle ICE".

  "On Consensus and Humming in the IETF", Pete Resnick, 18-Mar-13,
  <draft-resnick-on-consensus-02.txt>

    The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work through
       a consensus process, taking into account the different views among
       IETF participants and coming to (at least rough) consensus on
       technical matters.  In particular, the IETF is supposed not to be run
       by a "majority rules" philosophy.  This is why we engage in rituals
       like "humming" instead of voting.  However, more and more of our
       actions are now indistinguishable from voting, and quite often we are
       letting the majority win the day, without consideration of minority
       concerns.  This document is a collection of thoughts on what rough
       consensus is, how we have gotten away from it, and the things we can
       do in order to really achieve rough consensus.
    
          Note: This document contains the musings of an individual.  Right
          now, it is just some rough notes and has lots of holes that need
          to be filled in.  Even if those holes are filled, in its current
          form, it is not intended to be published as an RFC, let alone
          being a BCP for a change of IETF policy.  If it evolves into such
          a thing, great.  If it simply sparks discussion as an Internet
          Draft, that's a perfectly fine outcome.

  "IGP Extensions for Stateful PCE Discovery", Siva Sivabalan, Jan Medved,
  Xian Zhang, 2-Apr-13, <draft-sivabalan-pce-disco-stateful-01.txt>

    When a PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR) participating in the
       Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a server participating in
       IGP, its presence and path computation capabilities can be advertised
       using IGP flooding.  Such IGP extensions exist for OSPF and ISIS.
       This document specifies two new PCE capabilities advertised by IGP.

  "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Hashed Attribute values
  for 'userPassword'", Michael Stroeder, 13-Mar-13,
  <draft-stroeder-hashed-userpassword-values-01.txt>

    This document describes the widely used syntax for storing hashed
       passwords in LDAP attribute 'userPassword'.  Furthermore it points
       out some of the deficiencies of the approach.  Its purpose is solely
       to document current practice, it does not define a new standard.

  "DNS Service Discovery options in DHCP", Stephen Orr, Cisco Systems,
  Tirumaleswar Reddy, Prashanth Patil, 29-Jan-13,
  <draft-orr-dhcp-dns-sd-options-00.txt>

    This document specifies DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options to deliver Service
       Discovery Domains required for DNS based service registration and
       discovery.

  "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) usage for Trickle ICE", Emil Ivov,
  Enrico Marocco, Christer Holmberg, 30-Jan-13,
  <draft-ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice-sip-00.txt>

    The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol describes a
       Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal for UDP-based multimedia
       sessions established with the offer/answer model.  The ICE extension
       for Incremental Provisioning of Candidates (Trickle ICE) defines a
       mechanism that allows ICE agents to shorten session establishment
       delays by making the candidate gathering and connectivity checking
       phases of ICE non-blocking.
    
       This document defines usage semantics for Trickle ICE with SIP.

  "Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for
  remote-initiated GMPLS LSP Setup", Zafar Ali, Siva Sivabalan, Clarence
  Filsfils, Robert Varga, Victor Lopez, Oscar de Dios, 31-Jan-13,
  <draft-ali-pce-remote-initiated-gmpls-lsp-00.txt,.pdf>

    PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP Setup in a Stateful PCE Model
         draft [I-D. draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] specifies
         procedures that can be used for creation and deletion of PCE-
         initiated LSPs under the active stateful PCE model. However, this
         specification is focused on MPLS networks, and does not cover
         remote instantiation of GMPLS paths.  This document complements
         PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP Setup in a Stateful PCE Model
         draft by addressing the extensions required for GMPLS applications,
         for example for OTN and WSON networks.
    
         When active stateful PCE is used for managing PCE-initiated LSP,
         PCC may not be aware of the intended usage of the LSP (e.g., in a
         multi-layer network). PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP Setup
         in a Stateful PCE Model draft does not address this requirement.
         This draft also addresses the requirement to specify on how PCC
         should use the PCEP initiated LSPs.

  "Data Types in the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service Protocol
  (RADIUS)", Alan DeKok, 12-Feb-13, <draft-dekok-radext-datatypes-02.txt>

    RADIUS specifications have used data types for two decades, without
       rigorously defining them as managed entities.  During this time,
       RADIUS implementations have named the data types, and have used them
       to as managed entities in attribute definitions.  This document
       updates the specifications to match established prctice.  We do this
       by naming data types defined in [RFC6158], which have been used since
       at least [RFC2865].  We provide an IANA registry for the data types,
       and update the RADIUS Attribute Type registry to include a "data
       type" field for each attribute.  Finally, we recommend that authors
       of RADIUS specifications use these types in preference to existing
       practice.

  "JSON Schema: interactive and non interactive validation", Kris Zyp,
  Gary Court, 31-Jan-13, <draft-fge-json-schema-validation-00.txt>

    JSON Schema (application/schema+json) has several purposes, one of
       which is instance validation.  The validation process may be
       interactive or non interactive.  For instance, applications may use
       JSON Schema to build a user interface enabling interactive content
       generation in addition to user input checking, or validate data
       retrieved from various sources.  This specification describes schema
       keywords dedicated to validation purposes.

  "Report from the IAB/IRTF Workshop on Congestion Control for Interactive
  Real-Time Communication", Hannes Tschofenig, Lars Eggert, Zaheduzzaman
  Sarker, 2-Apr-13, <draft-iab-cc-workshop-report-01.txt>

    This document provides a summary of the IAB/IRTF Workshop on
       'Congestion Control for Interactive Real-Time Communication', which
       took place in Vancouver, Canada, on July 28, 2012.  The main goal of
       the workshop was to foster a discussion on congestion control
       mechanisms for interactive real-time communication.  This report
       summarizes the discussions and lists recommendations to the Internet
       Engineering Task Force (IETF) community.
    
       The views and positions in this report are those of the workshop
       participants and do not necessarily reflect the views and positions
       of the authors, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) or the Internet
       Research Task Force (IRTF).

  "The "action" Link Relation", Ioseb Dzmanashvili, 31-Jan-13,
  <draft-ioseb-dzmanashvili-action-link-relation-00.txt>

    RFC 5988 [RFC5988] defined the way of indicating resources on the
    Web. This specification defines link relation type that may be used
    to express the relationships between a resource and associated
    actions that may be performed against context resource.
    
    Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)
    
    Distribution of this document is unlimited.  Comments should be sent

  "CLUE Signaling", Paul Kyzivat, Lennard Xiao, Christian Groves,
  13-Jun-13, <draft-kyzivat-clue-signaling-03.txt>

    This document specifies how signaling is conducted in the course of
       CLUE sessions.  This includes how SIP/SDP signaling is applied to
       CLUE sessions as well as defining a CLUE-specific signaling protocol
       that complements SIP/SDP and supports negotiation of CLUE application
       level data.

  "JSON Hyper-Schema: Hypertext definitions for JSON Schema", Geraint
  Luff, Kris Zyp, Gary Court, 31-Jan-13,
  <draft-luff-json-hyper-schema-00.txt>

    JSON Schema is a JSON based format for defining the structure of JSON
       data.  This document specifies hyperlink- and hypermedia-related
       keywords of JSON Schema.

  "Forward Error Correction for WebRTC using FEC FRAME", Giridhar Mandyam,
  Mike Luby, Thomas Stockhammer, Christian Foisy, 31-Jan-13,
  <draft-mandyam-rtcweb-fecframe-00.txt,.pdf>

    WebRTC provides a solution for peer-to-peer streaming between web
    applications by leveraging a Real-Time Protocol (RTP) stream between
    two clients.  This RTP stream is expected to be sent over an UDP
    (Universal Datagram Protocol) connection, which by definition has no
    built-in reliability.  Recently the FEC FRAME Working Group of the
    IETF has come up with a framework and technical recommendations for
    applying forward error correction (FEC) to unreliable streams.  This
    framework can be applied to WebRTC with minimal changes to the
    specification.

  <draft-morton-ippm-lmap-path-01.txt>

    This document defines a reference path for Large-scale Measurement of
       Broadband Access Performance (LMAP) and measurement points for
       commonly used performance metrics.

  "Thoughts on syntax for representing multiple media streams", Adam
  Roach, 31-Jan-13, <draft-roach-mmusic-mlines-00.txt>

    This document briefly explores the ramifications of combining
       multiple media streams into one SDP m= section versus expressing each
       in its own m= section.

  "Multi-Media Concepts and Relations", BoB, Magnus Westerlund, 1-Feb-13,
  <draft-burman-rtcweb-mmusic-media-structure-00.txt>

    There are currently significant efforts ongoing in IETF regarding
       more advanced multi-media functionalities, such as the work related
       to RTCWEB and CLUE.  This work includes use cases for both multi-
       party communication and multiple media streams from an individual
       end-point.  The usage of scalable encoding or simulcast encoding as
       well as different types of transport mechanisms have created
       additional needs to correctly identify different types of resources
       and describe their relations to achieve intended functionalities.
    
       The different usages have both commonalities and differences in needs
       and behavior.  This document attempts to review some usages and
       identify commonalities and needs.  It then continues to highlight
       important aspects that need to be considered in the definition of
       these usages.

  "IPv6 IPID Needed", Nalini Elkins, Lawrence Kratzke, Michael Ackermann,
  Keven Haining, 1-Feb-13, <draft-elkins-6man-ipv6-ipid-needed-00.txt>

    The IPv4 main header contained a 16-bit IP Identification (IPID) field
    used for fragmentation and reassembly.  In practice, this field
    was commonly used by network diagnosticians for tracking packets. In
    IPv6, the IPID has been moved to the Fragment header, and would only
    be used when fragmentation is required.  Thus, the IPID field in IPv6,
    is no longer able to be utilized in the valuable role it played in
    IPv4, relative to diagnostics and problem resolution.  This causes
    great concern in particular for end users and large enterprises, for
    whom Network/Application availability and performance can directly and
    profoundly affect bottom line financials. Several viable solutions to
    this situation exist. One potential solution is included in later
    sections of this RFC, but the primary intention of this RFC is to
    initiate action by the IETF on this issue, perhaps in the form of a
    Working Group Subcommittee.

  "An argument for encoding multiple media sources per m= section of
  SDP.", Peter Thatcher, Justin Uberti, 3-Feb-13,
  <draft-pthatcher-mmusic-many-sources-00.txt>

    This document explains why it is preferable to have multiple media
       sources encoded in SDP as one m= section rather than many m=
       sections, especially when there are a large number of video sources
       which change frequently and need dynamic resolution changes, such as
       in a video conferencing system.

  "Describing multiple RTP media streams in SDP", Roni Even, Jonathan
  Lennox, Qin Wu, 17-Feb-13, <draft-even-mmusic-multiple-streams-02.txt>

  Bhumip Khasnabish, 21-Feb-13,
  <draft-cao-sunset4-v4v6-mcast-addr-conversion-01.txt>

    This draft describes a mechanism for stateless conversion of IPv4
       multicast address to IPv6 multicast address and vice versa,using
       different rules.  These rules can be used in both IPv4-IPv6
       translation or encapsulation.  This solution can be used in any

       attribute values need to be specified for multiple sources in a PIM
       Join/Prune message.

  "Interconnecting IPv6 Multicast Islands over IPv4 Using IPv6 Multicast
  Provider Edge Routers", Cui Wang, Wei Meng, Bhumip Khasnabish, Jie Hu,
  6-Feb-13, <draft-wang-mboned-glo-ipv6-mcast-reachability-00.txt>

    This draft presents a method to interconnect IPv6 multicast islands
       over an IPv4 cloud.  This method relies on IPv6 Multicast Provider
       Edge routers (6MPE), which support Dual-Stack in order to connect to
       IPv6 multicast islands and to the IPv4 core.  The 6MPE routers extend
       the Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol(MP-BGP), exchange the IPv6
       multicast reachability information transparently over the IPv4 core
       using the MP-BGP.

  "PCP Anycast Address", Stuart Cheshire, 11-Mar-13,

  7-Feb-13, <draft-cotton-rfc4020bis-00.txt>

    This memo describes the process for early allocation of code points
       by IANA from registries for which "Specification Required", "RFC
       Required", "IETF Review", or "Standards Action" policies apply.  This
       process can be used to alleviate the problem where code point
       allocation is needed to facilitate desired or required implementation
       and deployment experience prior to publication of an RFC that would
       normally trigger code point allocation.
    
       This document obsoletes RFC 4020.

  "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) usage for Trickle ICE", Emil Ivov,
  Enrico Marocco, Christer Holmberg, 7-Feb-13,
  <draft-ivov-dispatch-trickle-ice-sip-00.txt>

    The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol describes a
       Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal for UDP-based multimedia
       sessions established with the offer/answer model.  The ICE extension
       for Incremental Provisioning of Candidates (Trickle ICE) defines a
       mechanism that allows ICE agents to shorten session establishment
       delays by making the candidate gathering and connectivity checking
       phases of ICE non-blocking.
    
       This document defines usage semantics for Trickle ICE with SIP.

  "Length Hiding Padding for the Transport Layer Security Protocol",
  Alfredo Pironti, Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos, 7-Feb-13,
  <draft-pironti-tls-length-hiding-00.txt>

    This memo proposes length hiding methods of operation for the TLS
       protocol.  It defines a TLS extension to allow arbitrary amount of
       padding in any TLS ciphersuite, and it presents guidelines and a
       reference implementation of record fragmentation and padding so that
       the length of the exchanged messages is effectively concealed within
       a given range of lengths.  The latter guidelines also apply to the
       standard TLS padding allowed by the TLS block ciphers.

  "An LMAP application for IPFIX", Marcelo Bagnulo, Brian Trammell,
  21-Feb-13, <draft-bagnulo-lmap-ipfix-01.txt>

    This document explores the possibility of using IPFIX to report test
       results from a Measurement Agent to a Collector, in the context of a
       large measurement platform.

  "Plan to Establish a Wisdom Task Force", Norbert Bollow, 16-May-13,
  <draft-bollow-wisdomtaskforce-06.txt>

    This memo calls for the creation of a new governance forum named
       "Wisdom Task Force" (WisdomTF).  The main purpose of the WisdomTF is
       to facilitate consensus-seeking strategy-oriented discussions
       regarding governance actions that may be decided by national
       parliaments.

  "Transmission of IPv6 packets over ITU-T G.9959 Networks", Anders
  Brandt, Jakob Buron, 18-Jun-13, <draft-brandt-6man-lowpanz-02.txt,.pdf>

    This document describes the frame format for transmission of IPv6
       packets and a method of forming IPv6 link-local addresses and
       statelessly autoconfigured IPv6 addresses on ITU-T G.9959 networks.

  "Encrypt-then-MAC for TLS and DTLS", Peter Gutmann, 18-Apr-13,
  <draft-gutmann-tls-encrypt-then-mac-02.txt>

    This document describes a means of negotiating the use of the
       encrypt-then-MAC security mechanism in place of TLS'/DTLS' existing
       MAC-then-encrypt one, which has been the subject of a number of
       security vulnerabilities over a period of many years.

  "Normalization Marker for AF PHB Group in DiffServ", Cheng-Jia Lai,
  Wenyi Wang, Stan Yang, Toerless Eckert, Fred Yip, 8-Feb-13,
  <draft-lai-tsvwg-normalizer-00.txt>

    This memo describes a Normalization Marker (NM) at DiffServ (DS)
       nodes to normalize the distribution of DS codepoint (DSCP) markings
       for an Assured Forwarding (AF) Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) group.  NM is
       useful for traffic conditioning with Active Queue Management (AQM)
       when the AF PHB group is deployed for multimedia service classes that
       carry video packets with advanced codec technologies.  Using NM can
       offer an incentive that is however missing in today's ecosystem of
       practical deployment, i.e., when congestion occurs in the AF PHB
       group, the network should allow a video codec to benefit from its
       effort of generating finer layers of intra-flow precedence (IFP) with
       discardable packets in a more balanced distribution.

  "Updates to PSC", Eric Osborne, 8-Feb-13,
  <draft-osborne-psc-updates-00.txt>

    This document contains four updates to RFC6378, "MPLS Transport
       Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection".  Two of them correct existing
       behavior.  The third clears up a behavior which was not explained in
       the RFC, and the fourth adds rules around handling capabilities
       mismatches.

  "TWAMP Flow-based Performance Measurement", Lishun Sun, Fang Yu,
  Xiangyang Gong, 8-Feb-13, <draft-sun-ippm-twamp-flowbased-00.txt>

    This memo describes an extension to the Two-Way Active Measurement
       Protocol (TWAMP).  Through carrying the information of business flow,
       it can measure the online performance without bringing effect to
       application significantly.

  "Using IEEE802.15.4e TSCH in an LLN context: Overview, Problem Statement
  and Goals", Thomas Watteyne, Maria Palattella, Luigi Grieco, 23-May-13,
  <draft-watteyne-6tsch-tsch-lln-context-02.txt>

    This document describes the environment, problem statement, and goals
       for using the IEEE802.15.4e TSCH MAC protocol in the context of LLNs.
       The set of goals enumerated in this document form an initial set
       only.

  "Recursive PCP", Stuart Cheshire, 10-Mar-13,
  <draft-cheshire-recursive-pcp-02.txt>

    The Port Control Protocol (PCP) allows clients to request explicit
       dynamic inbound and outbound port mappings in their closest on-path
       NAT, firewall, or other middlebox.  However, in today's world, there
       may be more than one NAT on the path between a client and the public
       Internet.  This document describes how the closest on-path middlebox
       generates a corresponding upstream PCP request to the next closest
       on-path middlebox, to request an appropriate explicit dynamic port
       mapping in that middlebox too.  Applied recursively, this generates
       the necessary chain of port mappings in any number of middleboxes on
       the path between the client and the public Internet.

  "RADIUS Extended Request", Peter Deacon, 1-May-13,
  <draft-deacon-radext-extended-request-01.txt>

    This document describes methods for RADIUS servers to communicate
       optional extended abilities to RADIUS clients. The abilities
       described provide for exchange of RADIUS packets where total packet
       length exceeds 4096 bytes.

  "IS-IS Flooding Scope LSPs", Les Ginsberg, Stefano Previdi, Yi Yang,
  16-Jun-13, <draft-ginsberg-isis-fs-lsp-01.txt>

    Intermediate System To Intermediate System (IS-IS) provides efficient
       and reliable flooding of information to its peers.  However the
       current flooding scopes are limited to either area wide scope or
       domain wide scope.  There are existing use cases where support of
       other flooding scopes are desirable.  This document defines new
       Protocol Data Units (PDUs) which provide support for new flooding
       scopes as well as additional space for advertising information
       targeted for the currently supported flooding scopes.
    
       The protocol extensions defined in this document are not backwards
       compatible with existing implementations and so must be deployed with
       care.

  "A Generic Bundle Mechanism for the Session Description Protocol (SDP)",
  Dale Worley, 15-Mar-13, <draft-worley-sdp-bundle-06.txt>

    This document defines a generic bundle mechanism for the Session
       Description Protocol (SDP) by which the media described by a number
       of media descriptions ("m= lines") are multiplexed and transmitted
       over a single transport association.  The single transport
       association is described by an additional media description, allowing
       SDP attributes to be applied to the aggregate, independently of
       attributes applied to the constituents.  In offer/answer usage, the
       bundle mechanism is backward compatible with SDP processors that do
       not understand the mechanism.  The mechanism is designed to be
       compatible with the limitations of the existing Internet
       infrastructure.

  "ICN Research Challenges", Dirk Kutscher, Suyong Eum, Kostas
  Pentikousis, Ioannis Psaras, Daniel Corujo, Damien Saucez, 10-Feb-13,
  <draft-kutscher-icnrg-challenges-00.txt>

    This memo describes research challenges for Information-Centric
       Networking.  Information-centric networking is an approach to evolve
       the Internet infrastructure to directly support this use by
       introducing uniquely named data as a core Internet principle.  Data
       becomes independent from location, application, storage, and means of
       transportation, enabling in-network caching and replication.
       Challenges include naming, security, routing, system scalability,
       mobility management, wireless networking, transport services, in-
       network caching, and network management.

  "Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) Architecture",
  David Waltermire, 10-Feb-13, <draft-waltermire-sacm-architecture-00.txt>

    This document identifies the architectural components, data flows,
       and the supporting standards needed to define an interoperable
       automation infrastructure required to support timely, accurate and
       actionable situational awareness over an organization's IT systems.
       This architecture is based on previous use case and requirements
       analysis.  Automation tools implementing the continuous monitoring
       approach described in this document will utilize this infrastructure
       together with existing and emerging event, incident and network
       management standards to provide visibility into the state of assets,
       user activities and network behavior.  Stakeholders will be able to
       use these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant security and
       operational data to understand the organizations security posture,
       quantify business risk, and make informed decisions that support
       organizational objectives while protecting critical information.
       Organizations will be able to use these tools to augment and automate
       information sharing activities to collaborate with partners to
       identify and mitigate threats.  Other automation tools will be able
       to integrate with these capabilities to enforce policies based on
       human decisions to harden systems, prevent misuse and reduce the
       overall attack surface.

  "User Defined Key Pair", Omar Omran, 18-Jun-13,
  <draft-omar-tls-udkp-01.txt>

    In this document, I provide a high-level design for a new protocol in
       the application layer of the TCP/IP suite that will build a secure
       tunnel between the user's browser and the server without the
       involvement of any third party. My proposed protocol is called User-
       Defined Key Pair (UDKP), and its objective is to build a secure
       tunnel between the user's browser and the server using a
       public/private key pair generated for the user on the fly inside the
       user's browser based on the user credential information. This key
       pair will be used by the protocol instead of the server certificate
       as the starting point for creating the secure tunnel.

  "Updates to PSC", Eric Osborne, 19-Mar-13,
  <draft-osborne-mpls-psc-updates-01.txt>

    This document contains four updates to RFC6378, "MPLS Transport
       Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection".  Two of them correct existing
       behavior.  The third clears up a behavior which was not explained in
       the RFC, and the fourth adds rules around handling capabilities
       mismatches.

  "Resource Priority Header (RPH) Registry Management Policy to IETF
  Review", Brian Rosen, 11-Feb-13, <draft-rosen-rph-reg-policy-00.txt>

    RFC4412 defines "Resource-Priority Namespaces" and "Resource-Priority
       Priority-values" registries.  The management policy of these
       registries is "Standards Action".  This document changes the
       management policy of these registries to "IETF Review".

  "RPKI Repository Analysis and Requirements", Tim Bruijnzeels, Oleg
  Muravskiy, Bryan Weber, 11-Feb-13,
  <draft-tbruijnzeels-sidr-repo-analysis-00.txt>

    The current RPKI Resource Certificate Repository Structure (RFC6480 &
       RFC6481) uses rsync as both a delta and transfer protocol.  Concerns
       have been raised about the scalability of this repository and the
       reliance on rsync.  This document provides an analysis of these
       concerns and formulates requirements for future work.

  "Channel Binding Signalling for the Generic Security Services
  Application Programming Interface", Nico Williams, 22-Feb-13,
  <draft-williams-kitten-channel-bound-flag-02.txt>

    This Internet-Draft proposes the addition of a "channel bound" return
       flag for the GSS_Init_sec_context() and GSS_Accept_sec_context()
       functions.  Two behaviors are specified: a default, safe behavior,
       and a behavior that is only safe when the application specifically
       tells the Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface
       (GSS-API) that it (the applicaiton) supports the new behavior.

  "Third-Party ALTO Server Discovery Prototype Implementation and
  Testbed", Sebastian Kiesel, 12-Feb-13,

       ALTO server discovery (3pdisc) procedure specified in
       draft-kist-alto-3pdisc-02.txt [I-D.kist-alto-3pdisc].  The prototype
       implementation has been written in Perl and tested with the GNU/Linux
       operating system.
    
       A set of BIND 9 configuration files and DNS zone files is also
       included.  They can be used for setting up a small, self-contained
       testbed.

  "JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Web Key (JWK) for Public Key
  Infrastructure (X.509) (PKIX) Certificates", Matthew Miller, Brian
  Campbell, 21-Feb-13, <draft-miller-jose-pkix-key-01.txt>

    This document defines a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Web Key
       (JWK) object to wrap Public Key Infrastructure (X.509) (PKIX)
       certificate chains, to allow for some interoperability between
       existing PKIX-based systems and newer JOSE-based systems.

  "Authentication Context Certificate Extension", Stefan Santesson,
  11-Mar-13, <draft-santesson-auth-context-extension-04.txt>

    This document defines an extension to certificates according to
       [RFC5280]. The extension defined in this document holds data about
       how the certificate subject was authenticated by the Certification
       Authority who issued the certificate where this extension appears.
    
       This document also defines one data structure for inclusion in this
       extension that designed to hold information when the subject is
       authenticated using a SAML assertion [SAML].

  "BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute for UDP", KuiKe Building, Zhenbin
  Li, Nischal Sheth, Yiu Lee, Fan Yongbing, 12-Feb-13,
  <draft-xu-softwire-encaps-udp-00.txt>

    This document specifies a new Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Tunnel
       Type of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) tunnels.

  "Generic UDP Encapsulation for IP Tunneling", Lucy Yong, KuiKe Building,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-yong-tsvwg-udp-encap-4-ip-tunneling-01.txt>

    This document describes a method for encapsulating the layer
       protocols within UDP at an IP network edge such that the payload
       protocol can be identified from the destination port value. The
       mechanism also allows for the source port to be used as the entropy
       field for the purpose of load balancing in environments such as
       Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) in the underlying IP network.
    
       Application of this technique is focused on tunneling payload
       network flows across IP networks in environments where load-
       balancing is required. No changes to the underlying IP network or
       the payload networks are required.

  "DECADE: DECoupled Application Data Enroute", Richard Alimi, Akbar
  Rahman, Dirk Kutscher, Yang Yang, Haibin Song, Kostas Pentikousis,
  10-Jun-13, <draft-alimi-protocol-01.txt>

    Content distribution applications, such as those those employing
       peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies, are widely used on the Internet and
       make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks.  Often,
       however, content distribution applications use network resources in a
       counter-productive manner.  One way to improve efficiency is to
       introduce storage capabilities within the network and enable
       cooperation between end-host and in-network content distribution
       mechanisms.  This is the capability provided by a DECADE-compatible
       system, which is introduced in this document.  DECADE enables
       applications to take advantage of in-network storage when
       distributing data objects as opposed to using solely end-to-end
       resources.  This document presents the underlying principles and key
       functionalities of such a system and illustrates operation through a
       set of examples.

  "Overlay Network - Path Computation Approaches", Snigdho Bardalai,
  Khuzema Pithewan, Rajan Rao, 13-Feb-13,
  <draft-bardalai-ccamp-overlay-path-comp-00.txt>

    This document discusses various path computations approaches which
       are applicable to overlay networks [framework doc ref]. It discusses
       how the customer edge nodes uses the information advertised by the
       provider network to compute a path between two customer edge nodes or
       how it can request the provider network to compute a path and setup
       an end-2-end LSP.

  "PCP Flow Examples", Mohamed Boucadair, 10-Jun-13,
  <draft-boucadair-pcp-flow-examples-02.txt>

  "Topology API Use Cases", Shane Amante, Jan Medved, Stefano Previdi,
  Thomas Nadeau, 14-Feb-13, <draft-amante-i2rs-topology-use-cases-00.txt>

    This document describes use cases for gathering routing, forwarding
       and policy information, (hereafter referred to as topology
       information), about the network.  It describes several applications
       that need to view the topology of the underlying physical or logical
       network.  This document further demonstrates a need for a "Topology
       Manager" and related functions that collects topology data from
       network elements and other data sources, coalesces the collected data
       into a coherent view of the overall network topology, and normalizes
       the network topology view for use by clients -- namely, applications
       that consume topology information.

  "GOST R 34.11-2012: Hash Function", Vasily Dolmatov, Alexey Degtyarev,

       Russian Federal standard hash function (GOST R 34.11-2012), which is
       one of the Russian cryptographic standard algorithms (called GOST
       algorithms).

  "IANA Guidance for Managing the ULE Registry", Gorry Fairhurst,
  18-Jun-13, <draft-fairhurst-ipdvb-ule-iana-03.txt>

    This document proposes an update to RFC 4326 to clarify and update
       the allocation rules for the Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation
       (ULE) next header registry.  This registry is used by ULE and Generic
       Stream Encapsulation (GSE) to record the codepoints of extension
       headers and protocols supported by these encapsulation protocols.

  "IKEv2 Security Gateway Discovery", Daniel Migault, Kostas Pentikousis,
  14-Feb-13, <draft-mglt-ipsecme-security-gateway-discovery-00.txt,.pdf>

    Modern Virtual Private Network (VPN) services are typically deployed
       using several security gateways and are frequently accessed over a
       wireless network.  There are several reasons for such a deployment
       ranging from enhancing system resilience to improving performance.
    
       For example, in order to handle traffic efficiently and reduce the
       burden in the core network, the VPN service may be implemented in a
       distributed manner using multiple Security Gateways.  A mobile VPN
       End User is attached to one of them using a WLAN interface and over
       time is likely to change its Security Gateway of attachment.  In this
       case, in order to optimize the overall user Quality of Experience
       (QoE), a VPN End User should select the next most appropriate
       Security Gateway based on the characteristics of the available
       Security Gateways.  This draft specifies how a VPN End User can
       securely collect information about Security Gateways in its network
       neighborhood in order to optimize its VPN experience.

  "The Virtual Private Network (VPN) Service in ALTO: Use Cases,
  Requirements and Extensions", Michael Scharf, Vijay Gurbani, Greg
  Soprovich, Volker Hilt, 14-Feb-13,
  <draft-scharf-alto-vpn-service-00.txt>

    The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is
       designed to allow entities with knowledge about the network
       infrastructure to export such information to applications that need
       to choose one or more resources from a candidate set.  This document
       provides motivation for using ALTO in a Virtual Private Network (VPN)
       environment.  We discuss use cases, requirements, and possible
       extensions to the base ALTO protocol that will be needed to support
       VPN services.

  "Negotiation of Extra Round Trip for Kerberos V5 Generic Security
  Services Mechanism", Nico Williams, Roland Dowdeswell, 15-Feb-13,
  <draft-williams-kitten-krb5-extra-rt-01.txt>

    This Internet-Draft proposes an extension to the Kerberos V5 security
       mechanism for the Generic Security Services Application Programming
       Interface (GSS-API) for using an extra pair of security context
       tokens in order to recover from certain errors.  Other benefits
       include: user2user authentication, authenticated errors (in some
       cases), and more.

  "Reporting Equivalent IPFIX Information Elements", Paul Aitken,
  15-Feb-13, <draft-aitken-ipfix-equivalent-ies-00.txt>

    This document proposes a method for IPFIX Exporting Processes
         to inform Collecting Processes of equivalent Information
         Elements, so that the Collecting Process can understand the
         equivalence and be enabled to process data across a change of
         Information Elements.

  "IS-IS Support for Unidirectional Links", Les Ginsberg, Sina Mirtorabi,
  Stefano Previdi, Abhay Roy, 15-Feb-13, <draft-ginsberg-isis-udl-00.txt>

    This document defines support for the operation of IS-IS over
       Unidirectional Links without the use of tunnels or encapsulation of
       IS-IS Protocol Data Units.  Adjacency establishment when the return
       path from the router at the receive end of a unidirectional link to
       the router at the transmit end of the unidirectional link is via
       another unidirectional link is supported.  The extensions defined
       here are backwards compatible - only the routers directly connected
       to a unidirectional link need to be upgraded.

  "URN For Country Specific Emergency Services", Christer Holmberg, Ivo
  Sedlacek, 19-Mar-13, <draft-holmberg-ecrit-country-emg-urn-02.txt>

    This document updates section 4.2 of RFC 5031, in order to allow the

  "Microloop prevention by introducting a local convergence delay",
  Stephane Litkowski, Bruno Decraene, Pierre Francois, 15-Feb-13,
  <draft-litkowski-rtgwg-uloop-delay-00.txt>

    This document describes a mechanism for link-state routing protocols
       to prevent a subset of transient loops during topology changes.  It
       introduces a two-step convergence by introducing a delay between the
       network wide convergence and the node advertising the failure.  As
       the network wide convergence is delayed in case of down events, this
       mechanism can be used for planned maintenance or for unplanned outage
       provided a fast reroute mechanism is used in conjunction to convert a
       failure into a less urgent topology change.
    
       Simulation using real network topologies and costs, with pathological
       convergence behaviour, have been performed.  While the proposed
       mechanism does not provide a complete solution, it is simple and it
       solves an interesting fraction of the transient loops in the analyzed
       SP topologies.

  "IKEv2 Alternate Outer IP Address Extension", Daniel Migault, 15-Feb-13,
  <draft-mglt-ipsecme-alternate-outer-address-00.txt,.pdf>

    Current IKEv2 protocol has been designed to establish VPNs with the
       same outer IP addresses as those used for the IKEv2 channel.  This
       describes the alternate outer IP address extension, and IKEv2
       extension that enables the VPN End User to negotiate a VPN on
       different interfaces as those used for the IKEv2 channel.
    
       Thus, this extension makes possible a VPN End User with multiple
       interfaces to set an IPsec tunnel on each interface with a Security
       Gateway by using a single IKEv2 channel instead of using an IKEv2
       channel per interface.  Similarly, for distributed Security Gateways,
       it also makes possible to split the IKEv2 and IPsec traffic on
       different interfaces.

  "The WebSocket Protocol as a Transport for the Binary Floor Control
  Protocol (BFCP)", Victor Pascual, Robert Welbourn, Stephane Cazeaux,
  15-Feb-13, <draft-pascual-dispatch-bfcp-websocket-00.txt>

    The WebSocket protocol enables two-way realtime communication between
       clients and servers.  This document specifies a new WebSocket sub-
       protocol as a reliable transport mechanism between Binary Floor
       Control Protocol (BFCP) entities to enable usage of BFCP in new
       scenarios.  This document normatively updates
       [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis] and
       [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4583bis]

  "Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) / Multicast Listener
  Discovery (MLD)-Based Multicast Translation ("IGMP/MLD Translation")",
  Simon Perreault, Tina Tsou, 15-Feb-13,
  <draft-perreault-pim-igmp-mld-translation-00.txt>

    This document describes translation between IGMP and MLD.  This
       allows single-stack multicast nodes to participate in multicast
       groups from a different address family.  Both sending and receiving
       is supported by this translation mechanism.  Both any-source and
       source-specific multicast (ASM and SSM) are supported as well.

  "A Comparison of IPv6 over IPv4 Tunnel Mechanisms", S.J.M. Steffann,
  Iljitsch van Beijnum, Rick van Rein, 31-May-13,
  <draft-steffann-tunnels-04.txt>

    This document provides an overview of various ways to tunnel IPv6
       packets over IPv4 networks.  It covers mechanisms in current use,
       touches on several mechanisms that are now only of historic interest,
       and discusses some newer tunnel mechanisms that are not (yet) widely
       used at the time of publication.  The goal of the document is helping
       people with an IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling need to select the mechanisms
       that may apply to them.

  "Negotiating Human Language Using SDP", Randy, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-gellens-negotiating-human-language-02.txt>

    Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities, and
       preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.  When
       establishing interactive communication "calls" there needs to be a
       way to communicate and ideally match (i.e., negotiate) the caller's
       language needs, abilities, and preferences with the capabilities of
       the called party.  This is especially important with emergency
       calling, where a call can be routed to a PSAP or call taker capable
       of communicating with the user, or a translator or relay operator can
       be bridged into the call during setup, but this applies to non-
       emergency calls as well (as an example, when calling an airline
       reservation desk).
    
       This document describes the need and expected use, and discusses the
       solution using either an existing or new SDP attribute.

  "On the Validation of TCP Sequence Numbers", Fernando Gont, David
  Borman, 16-Feb-13, <draft-gont-tcpm-tcp-seq-validation-00.txt>

    When TCP receives packets that lie outside of the receive window, the
       corresponding packets are dropped and either an ACK, RST or no
       response is generated due to the out-of-window packet, with no
       further processing of the packet.  Most of the time, this works just
       fine and TCP remains stable, especially when a TCP connection has
       unidirectional data flow.  However, there are three scenarios in
       which packets that are outside of the receive window should still
       have their ACK field processed, or else a packet war will take place.
       The aforementioned issues have affected a number of popular TCP
       implementations, typically leading to connection failures, system
       crashes, or other undesirable behaviors.  This document describes the
       three scenarios in which the aforementioned issues might arise, and
       formally updates RFC 793 such that these potential problems are
       mitigated.

  "A Near Term Solution for Home IP Networking (HIPnet)", Chris
  Grundemann, Chris Donley, John Brzozowski, Lee Howard, Victor Kuarsingh,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-grundemann-homenet-hipnet-01.txt>

    Home networks are becoming more complex.  With the launch of new
       services such as home security, IP video, Smart Grid, etc., many
       Service Providers are placing additional IPv4/IPv6 routers on the
       subscriber network.  This document describes a self-configuring home
       router that is capable of operating in such an environment, and that
       requires no user interaction to configure it.  Compliant with
       draft-ietf-homenet-arch, it uses existing protocols in new ways
       without the need for a routing protocol.

  "PCP Server Discovery based on well-known IP Address", Sebastian Kiesel,
  Reinaldo Penno, 16-Feb-13, <draft-kiesel-pcp-ip-based-srv-disc-00.txt>

    The Port Control Protocol (PCP) provides a mechanism to control how
       incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices such as Network
       Address Translator IPv6/IPv4 (NAT64), Network Address Translator
       IPv4/IPv4 (NAT44), IPv6 and IPv4 firewall devices, and a mechanism to
       reduce application keep alive traffic.
    
       This document establishes a well-known IP address for the PCP Server
       and documents how PCP clients embedded in endpoints can use it during
       the discovery and regular operation phases.

  "Ruoska Encoding", JPM, 21-Mar-13, <draft-ruoska-encoding-04.txt>

    This document describes hierarchically structured binary encoding
       format called the Ruoska Encoding (RSK).  The main design goals are
       minimal resource usage, well defined structured with good selection
       of widely known data types, and still extendable for future usage.
    
       The main benefit when compared to non binary hierarchically
       structured formats like XML is simplicity and minimal resource
       demands.  Even basic XML parsing is time and memory consuming
       operation.
    
       When compared to other binary formats like encoding formats of ASN.1
       the main benefit is simplicity.  ASN.1 with different encondings is
       complex and even simple implementation needs a lot of effort.

  "Considerations on using NETCONF with LMAP Measurement Agents", Juergen
  Schoenwaelder, 16-Feb-13, <draft-schoenw-lmap-netconf-00.txt>

    This document discusses how the NETCONF protocol can be used to
       configure LMAP measurement agents.

  "A YANG Data Model for LMAP Measurement Agents", Juergen Schoenwaelder,
  16-Feb-13, <draft-schoenw-lmap-yang-00.txt>

    This document sketches a data model for configuring and scheduling
       tests for large scale broadband access network measurements.  The
       data model is defined using the YANG data modeling language.

  "The Incident Object Description Exchange Format", Roman Danyliw, Paul
  Stoecker, 16-Feb-13, <draft-stoecker-danyliw-rfc5070bis-00.txt>

    The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a
       data representation that provides a framework for sharing information
       commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams
       (CSIRTs) about computer security incidents.  This document describes
       the information model for the IODEF and provides an associated data
       model specified with XML Schema.

  "Use case of IPv6 prefix semantics for operators", Qiong Sun, Qiong Sun,
  Sheng Jiang, 25-Feb-13, <draft-sun-v6ops-semantic-usecase-01.txt>

    Embedding certain semantics into IPv6 addresses will bring a lot of
       benifits for operators to simplify network management and apply
       operations accordingly[I-D.jiang-semantic-prefix].  This memo
       illustrates the use case of semantic bits from operator's point of
       view, and provides considerations on how to design the semantic bits
       in IPv6 address.

  "Integration Examples of DECADE System", Ning Zong, Xiaohui Chen,
  Zhigang Huang, Lijiang Chen, Hongqiang Liu, 16-Feb-13,
  <draft-zong-integration-example-00.txt>

    Decoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) system is an in-network
       storage infrastructure which was discussed in IETF.  This document
       presents two detailed examples of how to integrate such in-network
       storage infrastructure into peer-to-peer (P2P) applications to
       achieve more efficient content distribution, and Application Layer
       Traffic Optimization (ALTO) system to build a content distribution
       platform for Content Providers (CPs).

  "PMIPv6 Multicast Routing Optimization with PIM-SM", Hitoshi Asaeda,
  Pierrick Seite, 17-Feb-13,
  <draft-asaeda-multimob-pmip6-ropt-with-pim-00.txt>

    This document describes IP multicast routing optimization with PIM-SM
       in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) environment.  The Mobile Access Gateway
       (MAG) and the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) are the mobility entities
       defined in the PMIPv6 protocol and act as PIM-SM routers.  The
       proposed protocol optimization addresses the tunnel convergence
       problem and cooperates with seamless handover mechanisms.

  "Using IS-IS with Role-Based Access Control", Fred Baker, 17-Feb-13,
  <draft-baker-ipv6-isis-dst-flowlabel-routing-00.txt>

    This note describes the changes necessary for IS-IS to route classes
       of IPv6 traffic that are defined by an IPv6 Flow Label and a
       destination prefix.  This implies not routing "to a destination", but
       "traffic matching a classification tuple".  The obvious application
       is data center inter-tenant routing using a form of role-based access
       control.  If the sender doesn't know the value to insert in the flow
       label (the receiver's tenant ID), he in effect has no route to that
       destination.

  "IPv6 Source/Destination Routing using IS-IS", Fred Baker, 17-Feb-13,
  <draft-baker-ipv6-isis-dst-src-routing-00.txt>

    This note describes the changes necessary for IS-IS to route classes
       of IPv6 traffic that are defined by a source prefix and a destination
       prefix.  This implies not routing "to a destination", but "traffic
       matching a classification tuple".  The obvious application is egress
       routing - routing traffic using a given prefix to an upstream network
       that will not drop traffic using that prefix using BCP 38 filters.

  "Using OSPFv3 with Role-Based Access Control", Fred Baker, 2-May-13,
  <draft-baker-ipv6-ospf-dst-flowlabel-routing-02.txt>

    This note describes the changes necessary for OSPFv3 to route classes
       of IPv6 traffic that are defined by an IPv6 Flow Label and a
       destination prefix.  This implies not simply routing "to a
       destination", but "traffic going to that destination AND using a
       specified flow label".  It may be combined with other qualifying
       attributes, such as "traffic going to that destination AND using a
       specified flow label AND from a specified source prefix".  The
       obvious application is data center inter-tenant routing using a form
       of role-based access control.  If the sender doesn't know the value
       to insert in the flow label (the receiver's tenant ID), it in effect
       has no route to that destination, thus providing an access list that
       is as changeable and scalable as routing.

  "IPv6 Source/Destination Routing using OSPFv3", Fred Baker, 2-May-13,
  <draft-baker-ipv6-ospf-dst-src-routing-02.txt>

    This note describes the changes necessary for OSPFv3 to route classes
       of IPv6 traffic that are defined by an IPv6 source prefix and a
       destination prefix.  This implies not simply routing "to a
       destination", but "traffic going to that destination AND coming from
       a specified source".  It may be combined with other qualifying
       attributes, such as "traffic going to that destination AND using a
       specified flow label AND from a specified source prefix".  The
       obvious application is egress routing, as required for a multihomed
       entity with a provider-allocated prefix from each of several upstream
       networks.  Traffic within the network could be source/destination
       routed as well, or could be routed from "any prefix", ::/0.  If
       traffic is routed from the relevant PA prefixes but in fact has a
       source address that is in none of them, the traffic in effect has no
       route.

  "Load-balancing to Data Centers in a L3VPN environment based on Power",
  Balaji Venkataswami, Bhargav Bhikkaji, Shankar Raman, 17-Feb-13,
  <draft-balaji-panet-dc-label-semantic-for-pwr-00.txt>

    Data Centers may be spread across different locations for a
       particular enterprise. Different locations may mean within the same
       country but across different geographical locations, or outside the
       country even in a different continent. These data centers may be
       serving the enterprise or multiple enterprises / tenants wherein the
       regular enterprise site may request data from a data center site
       which could be one of the data center sites proximal to the
       enterprise site. Proximity is usually calculated based on a metric
       that is bandwidth driven or in terms with regard to the number of
       hops to reach that data center site hence bringing into play delay
       characteristics. Assume a topology where the data center sites and
       the enterprise sites are MPLS based L3VPN sites that are being
       provided connectivity through a Service Provider deploying Layer 3
       VPNs. Given such a topology it is possible that replication of data
       happens across the data centers in a timely manner to keep the data
       active and refreshed across all data center sites. Suitable
       mechanisms for such replication will come into play for this purpose.
       Thus any of the data centers can cater to the request from a user
       site.
    
       It is possible that power consumption in each data center may vary
       according to the load on each data center. It would be prudent to
       introduce a scheme where the power metric coupled with other metrics
       such as bandwidth and delay be used by a Provider Edge router in a
       L3VPN scenario to direct the packets or requests from regular user
       sites to such data centers with the least such metric. This is in
       line with the follow-the-moon strategy of directing requests for data
       and compute to data centers which are power-wise more efficient
       during the night or during the day. This draft document lays out one
       such proposal.

  "Mutually Exclusive Link Group (MELG)", Vishnu Beeram, Igor Bryskin,
  17-Feb-13, <draft-beeram-ccamp-melg-00.txt>

    This document introduces the concept of MELG ("Mutually Exclusive
       Link Group") and discusses its usage in the context of mutually
       exclusive Virtual TE Links.

  "Analysis of NAT64 Port Allocation Method", Gang Chen, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-chen-sunset4-cgn-port-allocation-01.txt>

    The document enumerated methods of port assignment in CGN contexts,
       more focused on NAT64 environments.  The analysis categorized the
       different methods with several key features.  Corresponding to those
       features, the uses of existing protocols are also described.  The
       potential concerns and workaround have been discussed.  It's expected
       the document could provide a informative base line to help operators
       choosing a proper method.

  "Extension to Purge Initiator Identification TLV for ISIS in TRILL",
  Gang Chen, 17-Feb-13, <draft-chen-trill-isis-purge-00.txt>

    This memo specified an extension of ISIS TLV for identifying purge
       initiator in TRILL environments.  With the extension, it's beneficial
       for operators to nail down the root cause when there is a corrupted
       LSP spread within a layer-2 network.  The defined TLV is expected to
       record the system ID, Nickname and impacted VLAN information.
       RBridge should propagate the TLV information without changes in order
       to flood the information.

  "Using DMARC", DCrocker, 29-Apr-13, <draft-crocker-dmarc-bcp-02.txt>

    Email abuse often relies on unauthorized use of a domain name, such
       as one belonging to a well-known company (brand).  SPF and DKIM
       provide basic domain name authentication methods for email.  A recent
       industry effort built an additional authentication-based layer,
       called Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance
       (DMARC).  It allows a sender to indicate that their emails are
       protected by SPF and/or DKIM, and tells a receiver what to do if
       neither of those authentication methods passes; it also provides a
       reporting mechanism, from receivers back to domain owners.  Such
       capabilities over the public Internet are unusual and their use is
       not yet well-understood.  This document formulates a set of best
       practices for the use of DMARC.

  "TRILL: Vendor Specific TRILL Channel Protocol", Donald Eastlake, Li
  Yizhou, Hao Weiguo, Ayan Banerjee, 17-Feb-13,
  <draft-eastlake-trill-vendor-channel-00.txt>

    The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
       protocol is implemented by devices called TRILL switches or RBridges
       (Routing Bridges). TRILL includes a general mechanism, called RBridge
       Channel, for the transmission of typed messages between RBridges in
       the same campus and between RBridges and end stations on the same
       link. This document specifies how to send vendor specific messages
       over the RBridge Channel facility.

  "An Architecture for Middlebox State Migration", Gu Yingjie, Melinda
  Shore, Senthil Sivakumar, Dacheng Zhang, 22-Feb-13,
  <draft-gu-statemigration-arch-01.txt>

    This draft use several motivation use cases to indicate the
       importance of the state migration work.  An architecture and
       components of a solution is given conceiving the use cases, together
       with the interfaces and data models that are required in the
       architecture.

  "OUI Registry Restructuring", Glenn Parsons, 17-Feb-13,
  <draft-ieee-rac-oui-restructuring-00.txt>

    The IEEE Registration Authority Committee, which has oversight
       for the OUI based registries, is seeking IETF community input on
       its proposal to restructure the OUI registries.  This document
       provides background on the RAC as well as explaining the proposed
       restructuring and the rationale.

  "A Virtualized Network Element Framework", Kenji Kumaki, Pradosh
  Mohapatra, David Meyer, 17-Feb-13, <draft-kumaki-vnef-00.txt>

    This document outlines a new architectural paradigm of virtualizing
       the service provider networks and its associated engineering
       requirements.  The framework is referred to as the virtual network
       element framework (VNEF) in the document.

  "Routing Extensions for Discovery of Role-based MPLS Label Switching
  Router (MPLS LSR) Traffic Engineering (TE) Mesh Membership", Zhenbin Li,
  Mach Chen, 17-Feb-13, <draft-li-ccamp-role-based-automesh-00.txt>

    A Traffic Engnieering (TE) mesh-group is defined as a group of Label
       Switch Routers (LSRs) that are connected by a full mesh of TE LSPs.
       Routing (OSPF and IS-IS) extensions for discovery Multiprotocol Label
       Switching (MPLS) LSR TE mesh membership has been defined to automate
       the creation of mesh of TE LSPs.
    
       This document introduces a role-based TE mesh-group that applies to
       the scenarios where full mesh TE LSPs are not necessary and TE LSPs
       setup depends on the roles of LSRs in a TE mesh-group.  Interior
       Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing extensions for automatic discovery of
       role-based TE mesh membership are defined accordingly.

  "Alternative Constraints for Point-to-Multipoint Traffic-Engineered MPLS
  Label Switched Paths(LSPs)", Zhenbin Li, Tieying Huang, 17-Feb-13,
  <draft-li-mpls-p2mp-te-alt-path-00.txt>

    The document proposes a solution to be able to set up the alternative
       path for specific leaf nodes of a P2MP TE LSP.  Corresponding RSVP-TE
       protocol extension is also defined.  The solution is used to cope
       with the issue that in some scenarios traffic loss happens even if
       there exists possible path for the leaf nodes.

  "OSPF Extensions for Automatic Computation of MPLS Traffic Engineering
  Path Using Traffic Engineering Layers and Areas", Zhenbin Li, Li Zhang,
  Yuanjiao Liu, 17-Feb-13, <draft-li-ospf-auto-mbb-te-path-00.txt>

    As the network scale expands, especially in the mobile backhaul
       network, automatic computation of MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) path
       becomes very important.  But owing to requirements on the MPLS TE
       path, explicit path or affinity property has to be introduced for the
       path computation.  This causes the complexity of MPLS TE path design.
       The document proposes an architecture and corresponding OSPF
       extensions to improve automation on computation of MPLS TE path.
       MPLS TE networks are divided into different traffic engineering
       layers and areas according to the characteristics of the network
       topology.  MPLS TE path can compute automatically based on traffic
       engineering layers and areas to satisfy major requirements to bear
       mobile network services.

  "OSPF Extensions for MPLS Green Traffic Engineering", Gang Yan, Jianjun
  Yang, Zhenbin Li, 17-Feb-13, <draft-li-ospf-ext-green-te-00.txt>

    The energy-saving is one important topic in the world, and now most
       of technology for energy-saving is related with the hardware design
       instead of that based on the whole network.  This document proposes
       OSPF extensions to synchronize the energy-saving parameter of each
       node in the network which will be considered when the LSP path is
       calculated.

  "A One-Way Loss Metric for IPPM", Guy Almes, Sunil Kalidindi, Matthew
  Zekauskas, Al Morton, 17-Feb-13, <draft-morton-ippm-2680-bis-00.txt>

    This memo (RFC 2680 bis) defines a metric for one-way loss of packets
       across Internet paths.  It builds on notions introduced and discussed
       in the IPPM Framework document, RFC 2330; the reader is assumed to be
       familiar with that document.

  "SCTP Overlay link for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD)", Marc
  Petit-Huguenin, 17-Feb-13,
  <draft-petithuguenin-p2psip-reload-sctp-00.txt>

    This document defines two new Overlay Link protocols to be used with
       REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), both using SCTP.  The
       Overlay Link protocol DTLS-SCTP-NO-ICE uses DTLS on top of native
       SCTP for overlays that do not require the use of ICE.  The Overlay
       Link protocol DTLS-SCTP-UDP uses DTLS on top of an UDP encapsulation
       of SCTP for overlays that require the use of ICE.

  "Hybrid-MAC Model for CAPWAP", Chunju Shao, Hui Deng, Farooq Bari, Rong
  Zhang, Satoru Matsushima, 17-Feb-13,
  <draft-shao-opsawg-capwap-hybridmac-00.txt>

    The CAPWAP protocol supports two modes of operation: Split and Local
       MAC (medium access control), which has been described in
       [RFC5415].There are many functions in IEEE 802l.11 MAC layer that
       have not yet been clearly defined whether they belong to either the
       AP (Access Point) or the AC (Access Controller)in the Split and Local
       modes.  Because different vendors have their own definition of these
       two models, depending upon the vendor many MAC layer functions
       continue to be mapped differently to either the AP or AC.  If there
       is no clear definition of split MAC and local MAC, then operators
       will not only need to perform vendor specific configurations in their
       network but will continue to experience difficulty in interoperating

  "IPv6 Delegated Prefix Verification Tool", Shishio Tsuchiya, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-shishio-v6ops-dpvt-01.txt>

    IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6
       (DHCP-PD) and IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) are technology to provide
       IPv6 prefix, not IPv6 address themselves.
    
       Delegated Prefix are controlled by Customer Premise Equipment (CPE)
       and 6rd Customer Edge (6rd CE).  The service provider can not confirm
       utilization of delegated prefix on CE and CPE.
    
       This document describes mechanism of verification for delegated
       prefix on CPE and CE from service provider side.

  "Differentiated Service Class Recommendations for LLN Traffic",
  Shitanshu Shah, Pascal Thubert, 17-Feb-13,
  <draft-svshah-tsvwg-lln-diffserv-recommendations-00.txt>

    Differentiated services architecture is widely deployed in
       traditional networks.  There exist well defined recommendations for
       the use of appropriate differentiated service classes for different
       types of traffic (eg. audio, video) in these networks.  Per-Hop
       Behaviors are typically defined based on this recommendations.  With
       emerging Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), it is important to have
       similar defined differentiated services recommendations for LLN
       traffic.  Defined recommendations are for LLN class of traffic
       exiting out of LLNs towards high-speed backbones, converged campus
       network and for the traffic in the reverse direction.

    it should communicate as well as the regulatory domain information.
    The mechanism is based on the LoST protocol .

  "MAC address learning in NVO3 using ARP", Qin Wu, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-wu-nvo3-mac-learning-arp-01.txt>

    [I.D-ietf-nvo3-framework] discusses using Dynamic data plane learning
       or control plane protocol to build and maintain the mapping tables
       and deliver encapsulated packets to their proper destination.
       However, there is no relevant work to discuss how those capabilities
       can be realized in details at the NVEs.  This document goes into
       details to discuss how MAC address learning works through data plane
       and control plane.

  "Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) for Time-based Scheduling",
  Xian Zhang, Young Lee, Ramon Casellas, Oscar de Dios, 17-Feb-13,
  <draft-zhang-pce-stateful-time-based-scheduling-00.txt>

    This document presents the architecture and procedures for stateful
    PCE to support time-based scheduling application and also provides

  "Extended Encoding Scheme for Shared List Link Group (SRLG)", Zafar Ali,
  George Swallow, Clarence Filsfils, Ori Gerstel, Stewart Bryant, Matt
  Hartley, 18-Feb-13, <draft-ali-ccamp-extended-srlg-00.txt>

    SRLGs play a key role in routing resiliency and capacity planning of
         multi-domain and multi-layer networks. Notion of SRLG are used to select a
         backup path that is disjoint from the primary path, to ensure disjointness
         of circuits and to avoid catastrophic partitioning outages.
    
         In the current specifications, SRLG is identified as a 32 bit number that
         is unique within an IGP domain [RFC4202]. There are many limitations to
         this approach of encoding SRLGs, especially in a multi-layer network. This
         draft outlines these limitations and suggests components of extended SRLG
         encoding scheme to address them.

  "Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extension
  for Label Switched Path (LSP) Inquiry", Zafar Ali, George Swallow,
  Clarence Filsfils, Ori Gerstel, Matt Hartley, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-ali-ccamp-lsp-inquiry-00.txt>

    RSVP-TE reoptimization procedure for Packet Switch Capable (PSC)
       tunnels and non-PSC tunnels has some differences. This document
       highlights these differences, describes how existing procedures can
       be used for reoptimization of non-PSC tunnels and proposes some
       enhancements for reoptimization of non-PSC tunnels.

  "A Google Congestion Control Algorithm for Real-Time Communication",
  Stefan Holmer, Harald Alvestrand, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-alvestrand-rmcat-congestion-00.txt>

    This document describes two methods of congestion control when using
       real-time communications on the World Wide Web (RTCWEB); one sender-
       based and one receiver-based.
    
       It is published as an input document to the RMCAT working group on
       congestion control for media streams.  The mailing list of that WG is
       rmcat@ietf.org.

  "PIM Join Attributes for LISP Environments", Jesus Arango, Stig Venaas,
  Isidor Kouvelas, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-arango-pim-join-attributes-for-lisp-00.txt,.pdf>

    This document defines two PIM Join/Prune attributes that support the
       construction of multicast distribution trees where the root and
       receivers are located in different LISP sites.  These attributes
       allow the receiver site to select between unicast and multicast
       transport and to convey the receiver RLOC address to the control
       plane of the root xTR.

  "Building Power-Efficient CoAP Devices for Cellular Networks", Jari
  Arkko, Anders Eriksson, Ari Keranen, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-arkko-lwig-cellular-00.txt>

    This memo discusses the use of the Constrained Application Protocol
       (CoAP) protocol in building sensors and other devices that employ
       cellular networks as a communications medium.  Building communicating
       devices that employ these networks is obviously well known, but this
       memo focuses specifically on techniques necessary to minimize power
       consumption.

  "Automated prefix allocation in IS-IS", Fred Baker, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-baker-ipv6-isis-automatic-prefix-00.txt>

    This note describes a TLV and associated mechanisms for the
       allocation of /64 prefixes from a less specific prefix.

  "Diameter Congestion and Filter Attributes", Brent Hirschman, Lyle
  Bertz, 18-Feb-13, <draft-bertz-dime-congestion-flow-attributes-00.txt>

    This document defines ECN and filter related attributes that can be
       used for improved traffic identification, support of ECN and
       minimized filter administration within Diameter.
    
       RFC 5777 defines a Filter-Rule AVP that accommodates extensions for
       classification, conditions and actions. It does not support traffic
       identification for packets using Explicit Congestion Notification as
       defined in RFC 3168 and does not provide specific actions when the
       flow(s) described by the Filter-Rule are congested.
    
       A Filter-Rule can describe multiple flows but not the exact number of
       flows. Flow count and other associated data (e.g. packets) is not
       captured in Accounting applications, leaving administrators without
       useful information regarding the effectiveness or understanding of
       the filter definition.

  "JSON format to represent DNS data", Stephane Bortzmeyer, 25-Feb-13,

  Requirements and Issues from a Network Provider Perspective", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-boucadair-lmap-considerations-00.txt>

    This document raises several points related to the ongoing LMAP
       (Large scale Measurement of Access network Performance) effort.  The
       goal is to contribute to define a scope for LMAP and its expected
       contribution.

  "VXLAN DCI Using EVPN", Sami Boutros, Ali Sajassi, Samer Salam, Dennis
  Cai, 24-Feb-13, <draft-boutros-l2vpn-vxlan-evpn-01.txt>

    This document describes how Ethernet VPN (E-VPN) technology can be
       used to interconnect VXLAN or NVGRE networks over an MPLS/IP network.
       This is to provide  intra-subnet connectivity at Layer 2 and control-
       plane separation among the interconnected VXLAN or NVGRE networks.
       The scope of the learning of host MAC addresses in VXLAN or NVGRE
       network is limited to data plane learning in this document.

  "Network Performance Isolation using Congestion Policing", Bob Briscoe,
  18-Feb-13, <draft-briscoe-conex-policing-00.txt>

    This document describes why policing using congestion information can
       isolate users from network performance degradation due to each
       other's usage, but without losing the multiplexing benefits of a LAN-
       style network where anyone can use any amount of any resource.
       Extensive numerical examples and diagrams are given.  The document is
       agnostic to how the congestion information reaches the policer.  The
       congestion exposure (ConEX) protocol is recommended, but other tunnel
       feedback mechanisms have been proposed.

  "Diameter Overload Data Analysis", Ben Campbell, Hannes Tschofenig,
  Jouni Korhonen, Adam Roach, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-campbell-dime-overload-data-analysis-00.txt>

    When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be
       able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to
       reduce sending traffic for some period of time.  Multiple mechanisms
       have been proposed for transporting overload and load information.
       While these proposals differ in many ways, they share similar data
       requirements.  This document analyzes the data requirements of each
       proposal with a view towards proposing a common set of of Diameter
       Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs).

  "Distributed Mobility Management Framework", Anthony Chan, Pierrick
  Seite, Kostas Pentikousis, 25-Feb-13, <draft-chan-dmm-framework-01.txt>

    This document introduces a framework for mobility management
       protocols in terms of their key, abstract logical functions.  We
       explain how the framework is capable of presenting a unified view,
       reducing the clutter that prevents a casual reader from understanding
       the commonalities between different approaches in mobility
       management.  A first order application of this framework is to enable
       us to examine previously standardized mobility management protocols,
       such as MIPv6 and PMIPv6 (as well as several of their extensions),
       and describe their core functionality in terms of different
       configurations of the logical functions defined by the framework.

  "Coloring based IP Flow Performance Measurement Framework", Mach Chen,
  Hongming Liu, Yuanbin Yin, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-chen-coloring-based-ipfpm-framework-01.txt>

    By setting one unused bit of the IP header of packets to "color" the
       packets into different color blocks, it naturally gives a way to
       measure the real packet loss and delay without inserting any extra
       OAM packets.  This is called "coloring" based IP Flow Performance
       Measurement (IPFPM).  This document specifies a framework and
       protocol for this "coloring" based IPFPM.

  "IS-IS Topology-Transparent Zone", Huaimo Chen, Renwei Li, Gregory
  Cauchie, So Ning, Alvaro Retana, 3-May-13, <draft-chen-isis-ttz-01.txt>

    This document presents a topology-transparent zone in a domain.  A
       topology-transparent zone comprises a group of routers and a number
       of circuits connecting these routers.  Any router outside of the zone
       is not aware of the zone.  The information about the circuits and
       routers inside the zone is not distributed to any router outside of
       the zone.  Any link state change such as a circuit down inside the
       zone is not seen by any router outside of the zone.

  "NVO3 Requirements Versus Available Protocol Capabilities", Xiaoming
  Chen, Tina Tsou, Evelyne Roch, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-chen-nvo3-gap-analysis-00.txt>

    This document matches candidate protocols against the NVO3
       requirements.  Based on the results, gaps are identified and further
       protocol work is recommended.

  "CAPWAP Extension for 802.11n and Power/channel Reconfiguration", Yifan
  Chen, Dapeng Liu, Hui Deng, Lei Zhu, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-chen-opsawg-capwap-extension-00.txt>

    CAPWAP binding for 802.11 is specified by RFC5416 and it was based on
       IEEE 802-11.2007 standard.  After RFC5416 was published in 2009,
       there was several new amendent of 802.11 has been published. 802.11n
       is one of those amendent and it has been widely used in real
       deployment.  This document extends the CAPWAP binding for 802.11 to
       support 802.11n.

  "Gateway-Initiated 4over6 Deployment", Yuchi Chen, Jianping Wu, Xiongyan
  Tang, 24-Feb-13, <draft-chen-softwire-gw-init-4over6-01.txt>

    Gateway-Initiated 4over6 (GI-4over6) is a variant of 4over6
       mechanisms which include Public 4over6
       ([I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6]) and Lightweight 4over6
       ([I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite]), and it's designed to
       satisfy the certain tunnel-based access scenario.  The GI-4over6
       extends the On-Link Client Relay Agent (LCRA) that is defined in
       [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6] and thus makes it enabled to help
       gateway device perform 4over6 CE function described in
       [I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6], and lwB4 function described in
       [I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite], while the public IPv4
       addresses (and available ports) are assigned to the end hosts that
       behind the gateway device.

  "ICN Management Considerations", Daniel Corujo, Kostas Pentikousis, Ivan
  Vidal, 18-Feb-13, <draft-corujo-icn-mgmt-00.txt,.pdf>

    This document aims to draw the attention of the ICNRG community to
       network management, an important but hitherto underdeveloped area of
       research in information-centric networking.  We consider that the
       availability of modern management mechanisms for information-centric
       networks will foster their deployment in real-world environments.
       For example, we argue that there is a need for creating basic network
       management tools early on while ICN is still in the design and
       experimentation phases that can evolve over time.  Perhaps ICN can
       borrow successful mechanisms from the host-centric paradigm and adapt
       them to the new network primitives.  Alternatively, novel network
       management schemes can be designed based on ICN primitives.  As a
       discussion starter, this document summarizes recently published
       approaches for ICN network management.  In particular, this first
       version presents a management framework for named data networking and
       reviews previous work on NetInf management.

  "PCEP Extensions for MPLS-TE LSP Automatic Bandwidth Adjustment with
  stateful PCE", Dhruv Dhody, Udayasree Palle, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-dhody-pce-stateful-pce-auto-bandwidth-00.txt>

    The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
       mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
       computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
       The extensions described in [STATEFUL-PCE] provide stateful control
       of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label
       Switched Paths (TE LSP) via PCEP, for a model where the PCC delegates
       control over one or more locally configured LSPs to the PCE.
    
       This document describes the automatic bandwidth adjustment of such
       LSPs under the stateful PCE model.

  "Extensions to OSPF facilitating the deployment of non-backward-
  compatible changes.", Mike Dubrovsky, Rashmi Shrivastava, Dean Cheng,
  18-Feb-13, <draft-dubrovsky-ospf-non-compatible-00.txt>

    This document specifies a generic mechanism that facilitates the
       deployment of non-backward-compatible changes in OSPF protocol.  This
       mechanism allows the OSPF routers to advertise the capability of non-
       backward-compatible functionality and to make the functionality
       operational only when supported by all participating routers.
       Depending on the functionality scope, capability advertisements must
       be propagated across a link, area or autonomous system (AS).  For
       link and area scope functionality, Router Information Link State
       Advertisement (LSA) is utilized to propagate the capability
       information.  For the cases when compatibility must be maintained
       across the whole OSPF autonomous system, new Area Information (AI)
       LSA is introduced.  The AI LSA is a TLV-based analog of Indication-
       LSA that is used for demand circuit functionality and described in
       RFC1793.

  "Modern cryptography TKEY", Francis Dupont, 18-Feb-13,

    This document updates the TKEY resource record specifications for the
       use of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, and related IANA registries.

  "A framework for large-scale measurements", Philip Eardley, Trevor
  Burbridge, Al Morton, 25-Feb-13, <draft-eardley-lmap-framework-01.txt>

    Measuring broadband service on a large scale requires standardisation
       of the logical architecture and a description of the key protocols
       that coordinate interactions between the components.  The document
       presents an overall framework for large-scale measurements and
       discusses which elements could be standardised in the IETF.  It is
       intended to assist the discussions about the potential creation of
       the LMAP working group.

  "Alternatives to BUNDLE", Richard Ejzak, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ejzak-mmusic-bundle-alternatives-01.txt>

    This paper discusses some potential modifications to the BUNDLE
       proposal for multiplexing of multiple media types within a single
       5-tuple to address limitations of the current proposal and
       alternatives already considered by MMUSIC.

  "IP Packet loss rate measurement testing and problem statement", Peng
  Fan, Lu Huang, 18-Feb-13, <draft-fan-opsawg-packet-loss-00.txt>

    This document describes common methods for measuring packet loss rate
       and their effectiveness.  Issues encountered when using the methods
       and necessary considerations are also discussed and recommended.

  "BGP IP VPN Data Center Interconnect", Luyuan Fang, Rex Fernando,
  Dhananjaya Rao, Dhananjaya Rao, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-fang-l3vpn-data-center-interconnect-01.txt>

    This document discusses solutions for inter-connection of BGP MPLS
       IP/VPN [RFC4364] and Data Center (DC) overlay networks. Two
       categories of inter-connections are discussed in this document. In
       the first category, Data Center overlay virtual network is built with
       BGP IP VPN technologies, the inter-connection of IP VPN in the Data
       Center to BGP IP VPN in the WAN enables end-to-end IP VPN
       connectivity. New Inter-AS solutions are required in certain
       scenarios, in addition to the existing Inter-AS Options (A, B, C)
       defined in [RFC4364]. In the second category, Data Centers overlay
       network uses non IP VPN technologies, the inter-connection of any
       overlay virtual network in the Data Center to BGP IP VPN in the WAN
       provides end user connectivity through stitching of different overlay
       technologies, the mapping of non IP VPN overlay to IP VPN need to be
       performed at the border Gateway of the two networks. The role of
       Software Defined Network (SDN) to assist the inter-connections is
       discussed.

  "BGP IP VPN Virtual CE", Luyuan Fang, John Evans, David Ward, Rex
  Fernando, John Mullooly, So Ning, Nabil Bitar, Maria Napierala,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-fang-l3vpn-virtual-ce-01.txt>

    This document describes the architecture and solutions of using
       virtual Customer Edge (vCE) of BGP IP VPN. The solution is aimed at
       providing efficient service delivery capability through CE
       virtualization, and is especially beneficial in virtual Private Cloud
       (vPC) environments for extending IP VPN into tenant virtual Data
       Center containers. This document includes: BGP IP VPN virtual CE
       architecture; Control plane and forwarding options; Data Center
       orchestration processes; integration with existing WAN enterprise
       VPNs; management capability requirements; and security
       considerations. The solution is generally applicable to any BGP IP
       VPN deployment. The virtual CE solution is complementary to the
       virtual PE solutions.
    
       Today's data center's require multi-tenancy and mechanisms to
       establish overlay network connectivity. This document describes one
       approach to enabling data center network connectivity.

  "BGP IP VPN Virtual PE", Luyuan Fang, David Ward, Rex Fernando, Maria
  Napierala, Nabil Bitar, Dhananjaya Rao, Bruno Rijsman, 7-Apr-13,
  <draft-fang-l3vpn-virtual-pe-02.txt>

    This document describes the architecture solutions for BGP/MPLS IP
       Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) with virtual Provider Edge (vPE)
       routers. It provides a functional description of the vPE control
       plane, the data plane, and the provisioning management process. The
       vPE solutions supports both Software Defined Networking (SDN)
       approach by allowing physical decoupling of the control and the
       forwarding plane of a vPE, as well as a distributed routing approach.
       These solutions allow vPE to be co-resident with the application
       virtual machines (VMs) on a single end device, such as a server, as
       well as on a Top-of-Rack switch (ToR), or in any network or compute
       device. The ability to provide end-to-end native BGP IP VPN
       connections between a Data Center (DC) (and/or other types of service
       network) applications and the Enterprise IP VPN sites is highly
       desirable to both Service Providers and Enterprises.

  "Problem Statement and Architecture for Information Exchange Between
  Interconnected Traffic Engineered Networks", Adrian Farrel, John Drake,
  Nabil Bitar, George Swallow, Daniele Ceccarelli, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-farrel-interconnected-te-info-exchange-00.txt>

    In Traffic Engineered (TE) systems, it is sometimes desirable to
       establish an end-to-end TE path with a set of constraints (such as
       bandwidth) across one or more network from a source to a destination.
       TE information is the data relating to nodes and TE links that is
       used in the process of selecting a TE path.  The availability of TE
       information is usually limited to within a network (such as an IGP
       area) often referred to as a domain.
    
       In order to determine the potential to establish a TE path through a
       series of connected networks, it is necessary to have available a
       certain amount of TE information about each network.  This need not
       be the full set of TE information available within each network, but
       does need to express the potential of providing TE connectivity. This
       subset of TE information is called TE reachability information.
    
       This document sets out the problem statement and architecture for the
       exchange of TE information between interconnected TE networks in
       support of end-to-end TE path establishment.  For reasons that are
       explained in the document, this work is limited to simple TE
       constraints and information that determine TE reachability.

  "UNI Extensions for Diversity and Latency Support", Don Fedyk, Dieter
  Beller, Lieven Levrau, Daniele Ceccarelli, Fatai Zhang, Yuji Tochio,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-fedyk-ccamp-uni-extensions-01.txt>

    This document builds on the GMPLS overlay model [RFC4208] and defines
       extensions to the GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) to support route
       diversity within the core network for sets of LSPs initiated by edge
       nodes. A particular example where route diversity within the core
       network is desired, are dual-homed edge nodes. The document also
       defines GMPLS UNI extensions to deal with latency requirements for
       edge node initiated LSPs.
    
       This document uses a VPN model that is based on the same premise as
       L1VPN framework [RFC4847] but may also be applied to other
       technologies.  The extensions are applicable both to VPN and non VPN
       environments. These extensions move the UNI from basic connectivity
       to enhanced mode connectivity by including additional constraints
       while minimizing the exchange of CE to PE information. These
       extensions are applicable to the overlay extension service model.
       Route Diversity for customer LSPs are a common requirement applicable
       to L1VPNs. The UNI mechanisms described in this document are L1VPN
       compatible and can be applied to achieve diversity for sets of
       customer LSPs.
    
       The UNI extensions in support of latency constraints can also be
       applied to the extended overlay service model in order for the
       customer LSPs to meet certain latency requirements.

  "A VP9 Bitstream Overview", Adrian Grange, Harald Alvestrand, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-grange-vp9-bitstream-00.txt>

    This document describes VP9, a video codec being developed
       specifically to meet the demand for the consumption of video over the
       Internet, including professionally and amateur produced video-on-
       demand and conversational video content.  VP9 is an evolution of the
       VP8 video codec that is described in [bankoski-rfc6386] and includes
       a number of enhancements and new coding tools that have been added to
       improve the coding efficiency.  The new tools that have been added so
       far include: larger prediction block sizes up to 64x64, various forms
       of compound INTER prediction, more modes for INTRA prediction,
       &#8539;-pel motion vectors, 8-tap switchable sub-pixel interpolation
       filters, improved motion reference generation, improved motion vector
       coding, improved entropy coding including frame-level entropy
       adaptation for various symbols, improved loop filtering, the
       incorporation of the Asymmetric Discrete Sine Transform (ADST),
       larger 16x16 and 32x32 DCTs, and improved frame level segmentation.
       VP9 is under active development and this document provides only a
       snapshot of the current state of the coding tools as they exist
       today.  The finalized version of the VP9 bitstream may differ
       considerably from the description contained herein and may encompass
       the exclusion or modification of existing coding tools or the
       addition of new coding tools.

  "Advertising MPLS labels in IGPs", Hannes Gredler, Shane Amante, Tom
  Scholl, Luay Jalil, 15-May-13,
  <draft-gredler-rtgwg-igp-label-advertisement-05.txt>

    Historically MPLS label distribution was driven by session oriented
       protocols.  In order to obtain a particular routers label binding for
       a given destination FEC one needs to have first an established
       session with that node.
    
       This document describes a mechanism to distribute FEC/label mappings
       through flooding protocols.  Flooding protocols publish their objects
       for an unknown set of receivers, therefore one can efficiently scale
       label distribution for use cases where the receiver of label
       information is not directly connected.
    
       Application of this technique are found in the field of backup
       (Bypass, R-LFA) routing, Label switched path stitching, egress
       protection, explicit routing and egress ASBR link selection.

  "3GPP IMS Option for IKEv2", Aeneas Noble, Sri Gundavelli, Jouni
  Korhonen, Florin Baboescu, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-gundavelli-ipsecme-3gpp-ims-options-00.txt>

    This document defines two new configuration attributes for Internet
       Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2).  These attributes can be
       used for carrying the IPv4 and IPv6 address of the Proxy-Call Control
       and Service function (P-CSCF).  This is one of the few methods that
       an IPsec client can obtain the IP address of the P-CSCF function
       located in the home network.

  "Well Known Service and URI Declarations", Phillip Hallam-Baker,
  18-Feb-13, <draft-hallambaker-wellknown-00.txt>

    Under the current system of registration, separate requests are
       required to register entries for .well-known HTTP services, discovery
       via DNS mechanisms such as SRV and NAPTR and for a URI prefix.  This
       proposal encourages Web Services to adopt a consistent approach to
       configuration through a 'one stop' registration system whereby
       assignment of a .well-known identifier automatically assigns DNS and
       URI prefixes.

  "SDP and CLUE message interactions", Robert Hansen, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-hansen-clue-sdp-interaction-01.txt>

    This document attempts to help resolve some of the complexities of
       interaction between SDP and CLUE messages in call flows by providing
       some strategies and some suggested syntax.

  "Use Cases for Virtual Connections on Demand (VCoD) and Virtual Network
  on Demand using Interface to Routing System", Susan Hares, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-hares-i2rs-use-case-vn-vc-00.txt,.pdf>

    Software Defined Networks (SDN) provide a way to virtualize and
       abstract the network and present the virtual or abstract resources to
       the third-party applications running in software.  The application
       can utilize a programmable interface to receiving these virtual or
       abstract resources in a form that allows monitoring or manipulation
       of resources.  Various programmatic interfaces have been proposed to
       interface directly to the forwarding plane (OpenFlow, ForCES), or do
       device configuration (NETCONF).  ALTO has proposed a informational
       interface to the application.  Only the progammatic Interface to the
       Routing System (IRS) provides an interface directly to the routing
       system to utilize all aspects of the routing system as a system.
    
       The IRS system interacts with the control plane processes to monitor
       best paths to any destination and to change the routing information
       base (RIB) or MPLS label information Base (LIB) which feeds the
       forwarding tables the information needed to actually switch traffic
       at a local level.
    
       This document outlines how SDN networks can use the IRS interface to
       implement an automated set of network services for Virtual Connection
       on Demand (VCoD) and Virtual Network on Demand (VNoD)

  "Security Requirements of NVO3", Sam Hartman, Dacheng Zhang, Margaret
  Wasserman, 18-Feb-13, <draft-hartman-nvo3-security-requirements-00.txt>

    This draft discusses the security requirements and several issues
       which need to be considered in securing a virtualized data center
       network for multiple tenants.  In addition, the draft also attempts
       to discuss how such issues could be addressed or mitigated.

  "Integrity Protection for Control Messages in NHDP and OLSRv2", Ulrich
  Herberg, Christopher Dearlove, Thomas Clausen, 18-Mar-13,
  <draft-herberg-manet-nhdp-olsrv2-sec-02.txt>

    This document specifies integrity and replay protection for required
       implementation in the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)
       and the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).
       This document specifies how an included integrity check value (ICV)
       and a timestamp TLV, defined in RFC6622bis, are used by NHDP and
       OLSRv2 for countering a number of security threats.  The ICV TLV uses
       a SHA-256 based HMAC and a single shared secret key.  The timestamp
       TLV is based on POSIX time, and assumes that the clocks in all
       routers in the network can be synchronized with sufficient precision.
       The mechanism in this specification can also be used for other MANET
       protocols using RFC5444.

  "Integrity Check Value and Timestamp TLV Definitions for Mobile Ad Hoc
  Networks (MANETs)", Ulrich Herberg, Thomas Clausen, Christopher
  Dearlove, 18-Mar-13, <draft-herberg-manet-rfc6622-bis-02.txt>

    This document extends and replaces RFC 6622.  It describes general
       and flexible TLVs for representing cryptographic Integrity Check
       Values (ICVs) (i.e., digital signatures or Message Authentication
       Codes (MACs)) as well as timestamps, using the generalized Mobile Ad
       Hoc Network (MANET) packet/message format defined in RFC 5444.  It
       defines two Packet TLVs, two Message TLVs, and two Address Block TLVs
       for affixing ICVs and timestamps to a packet, a message, and an
       address, respectively.

  "Energy Efficient Implementation of IETF Protocols on Constrained
  Devices", Zehn Cao, Xuan He, Matthias Kovatsch, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-hex-lwig-energy-efficient-00.txt>

    This document summarizes the problems and current practices of energy
       efficient protocol implementation on constrained devices, mostly
       about how to make the protocols within IETF scope behave energy
       friendly.

  "LISP EID Block Management Guidelines", Luigi Iannone, Roger Jorgensen,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-iannone-lisp-eid-block-mgmnt-01.txt>

    This document proposes an allocation framework for the management of
       the LISP EID address prefix (requested in a separate document).  Such
       framework relies on hierarchical distribution of the address space to
       RIRs (Regional Internet Registries), who will allocate on a temporary
       basis sub-prefixes to requesting organizations.

  "Vehicle Identification Number-Based IPv6 Interface Identifier (VIID)",
  Sofiane Imadali, Alexandru Petrescu, Christophe Janneteau, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-imadali-its-vinipv6-viid-00.txt>

    The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a 17 characters
       alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a vehicle worldwide.  This
       code is standardized in ISO-3779 and ISO-3780; other standardization
       bodies' implementation of this code (NHTSA, SAE) is compliant with
       ISO standards.  The VIN is mandatory for each vehicle and used as a
       unique identity.  Some public information related to a vehicle can be
       obtained knowing its VIN code.
    
       An IPv6 address is 128 bit in length and its rightmost bits form the
       Interface Identifier (IID).  When the IPv6 address is used with IPv6-
       over-Ethernet and Stateless Address Auto-Configuration, the length of
       the IID is 64 bit.
    
       This document presents an experimental method to convert an IPv6
       Interface Identifier starting from the VIN code - the VIID.  The
       conversion can be reverted - given a VIID formed from a VIN it easily
       possible to find out the original VIN.

  "Vehicle Identification Number-Based Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses
  (VULA)", Sofiane Imadali, Alexandru Petrescu, Christophe Janneteau,
  18-Feb-13, <draft-imadali-its-vinipv6-vula-00.txt>

    The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is standardized in ISO-3779
       and ISO-3780.  The VIN is made of 17 alphanumeric characters code
       that uniquely identifies a vehicle worldwide.  Some public
       information related to a vehicle can be obtained knowing its VIN
       code.  This code may also be used to enable novel vehicular
       networking communications.
    
       RFC 4193 introduces a globally unique IPv6 unicast address format
       intended for local communications, usually inside of a site.  These
       addresses (ULA) are not expected to be routable on the global
       Internet.  This document introduces a method to build a VIN-based
       IPv6 Prefix that is intended for local communications involving more
       than one hop (VULA).  The VIN-based generated prefix is assured to be
       unique among other VIN-based generated prefixes.  Typically, in a
       scenario involving several vehicles, each single vehicle (in which
       one Mobile Router is in charge) is capable of generating its own
       unique infrastructure-independent globally-scoped VIN-based IPv6
       prefix.  This document also describes some use cases where VULA could
       be exploited.

  "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) usage for Trickle ICE", Emil Ivov,
  Adam Roach, 18-Feb-13, <draft-ivov-dispatch-sdpfrag-00.txt>

    This document registers the application/sdpfrag Multipurpose Internet
       Mail Extensions (MIME) media type.  This type is similar to
       application/sdp, but allows certain subsets of well formed session
       descriptions, as per the Session Description Protocol (SDP), to be
       represented instead of requiring a complete SDP session description.
       The "a=candidate" lines that are incrementally exchanged between
       Trickle ICE agents are one example usage of the application/sdpfrag.

  "Proposed Plan for Usage of SDP and RTP", Cullen Jennings, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-jennings-rtcweb-plan-01.txt>

    This draft outlines a bunch of the remaining issues in RTCWeb related
       to how the the W3C APIs map to various usages of RTP and the
       associated SDP.  It proposes one possible solution to that problem
       and outlines several chunks of work that would need to be put into
       other drafts or result in new drafts being written.  The underlying
       design guideline is to, as much as possible, re-use what is already
       defined in existing SDP [RFC4566] and RTP [RFC3550] specifications.
    
       This draft is not intended to become an specification but is meant
       for working group discussion to help build the specifications.  It is
       being discussed on the rtcweb@ietf.org mailing list though it has
       topics relating to the CLUE WG, MMUSIC WG, AVT* WG, and WebRTC WG at
       W3C.

  "Network Proxy Protocol", Sangjin Jeong, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-jeong-eman-network-proxy-protocol-01.txt>

    In the current Internet, it is implicitly assumed that a network node
       is always active so that it can receive the incoming packets at any
       time.  Current networking services and applications are commonly
       designed to be fully available at all times with minimal response
       times.  This assumption keeps network nodes from entering sleeping
       mode in order to reduce energy consumption.  Further, during sleeping
       mode, network nodes may not immediately respond to the incoming
       packets or even lose them.  If network nodes are allowed to go into a
       sleeping mode, they can effectively reduce energy consumption during
       idle period.  Network proxy allows to delegate network node's traffic
       processing to an external system within a network, so that the nodes
       maintain network presence during their sleep.  This document
       describes communication mechanism between network nodes and proxy in
       order to accelerate the wider deployment of network proxy mechanism.

  "PIM Extensions for Protection Using Maximally Redundant Trees", Robert
  Kebler, Alia Atlas, Naiming Shen, Yiqun Cai, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-kebler-pim-mrt-protection-00.txt>

    This document specifies Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
       procedures for Failure Protection, as specified in the MRT Multicast
       architecture [I-D.atlas-rtwg-mrt-mc-arch-00].  This can be
       accomplished with Global Repair (aka Live-Live) or with Local Repair
       (aka Fast Re-route).  Maximally Redundant Trees (MRTs) provide the
       capability to PIM to provide alternate paths around any given
       failure.

  "Securing the IP-based Internet of Things with DTLS", Sye Keoh, Sandeep
  Kumar, Oscar Garcia-Morchon, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-keoh-lwig-dtls-iot-01.txt>

    The IP-based Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the pervasive
       interaction of smart devices and people enabling new applications by
       means of IP protocols. Traditional IP protocols will be further
       complemented by 6LoWPAN and CoAP to make the IoT feasible on small
       devices. Security and privacy are a must for such an environment. Due
       to mobility, limited bandwidth, resource constraints, and new
       communication topologies, existing security solutions need to be
       adapted. We propose a security architecture for the IoT in order to
       provide network access control to smart devices, the management of
       keys and securing unicast/multicast communication. Devices are
       authenticated and granted network access by means of a pre-shared key
       (PSK) based security handshake protocol. The solution is based on
       Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). Through the established
       secure channels, keying materials, operational and security
       parameters are distributed, enabling devices to derive session keys
       and group keys. The solution relies on the DTLS Record Layer for the
       protection of unicast and multicast data flows. We have prototyped
       and evaluated the security architecture. The DTLS architecture allows
       for easier interaction and interoperability with the Internet due to
       the extensive use of TLS. However, it exhibits performance issues
       constraining its deployment in some network topologies and hence
       would require further optimizations.

  "Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network
  Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols", Ari
  Keranen, Jonathan Rosenberg, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-keranen-mmusic-rfc5245bis-01.txt>

    This document describes a protocol for Network Address Translator
       (NAT) traversal for UDP-based multimedia sessions established with
       the offer/answer model.  This protocol is called Interactive
       Connectivity Establishment (ICE).  ICE makes use of the Session
       Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol and its extension,
       Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN).  ICE can be used by any protocol
       utilizing the offer/answer model, such as the Session Initiation
       Protocol (SIP).
    
       This document obsoletes RFC 5245.

  "<Opportunistic Linked-Increases Congestion Control Algorithm for
  MPTCP>", Ramin Khalili, Nicolas Gast, Miroslav Popovic, Jean-Yves Le
  Boudec, 18-Feb-13, <draft-khalili-mptcp-congestion-control-00.txt>

    This document describes the mechanism of OLIA, the "opportunistic
       linked increases algorithm". OLIA is a congestion control algorithm
       for MPTCP. The current congestion control algorithm of MPTCP, LIA,
       forces a tradeoff between optimal congestion balancing and
       responsiveness. OLIA's design departs from this tradeoff and provide
       these properties simultaneously. Hence, it solves the identified
       performance problems with LIA while retaining non-flappiness and
       responsiveness behavior of LIA [5].

  "Model-Based Estimation of Streaming Performance", Ken Ko, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-ko-ippm-streaming-performance-00.txt>

    This memo defines metrics plus a methodology for post-measurement
       processing of sample metrics to evaluate network path performance
       relative to streaming video traffic. The metrics are based on
       established methodologies for TCP throughput testing. The post-
       processing methodology is based on a model of streaming traffic that
       allows a given sample metric to be evaluated against multiple sets
       of parameters representing different streaming rates, delays and
       buffering values. The results of the post-processing methodology are
       derived metrics that are suitable for statistical analysis.

  "IPv6 Prefix Properties", Jouni Korhonen, Basavaraj Patil, Sri
  Gundavelli, Pierrick Seite, Dapeng Liu, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-korhonen-6man-prefix-properties-01.txt>

    This specification defines an extension to the IPv6 Neighbor
       Discovery protocol and the stateless address autoconfiguration
       procedure.  The Prefix Information Option is extended with flag bits
       that describe the properties associated to the prefix.  A new Classed
       Prefix Information Option is also defined to associate an advertised
       prefix with an additional meta data that the stateless address
       autoconfiguration procedure and end hosts can make use of.  This
       specification updates RFC4861 and RFC4862.

  "UDP Entropy Tunnel for Softwire", Carlos Pignataro, Nagendra Kumar,
  Pradosh Mohapatra, Clarence Filsfils, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-kumar-softwire-uet-00.txt>

    This document describes a method for encapsulatation of tunneled
       packets within UDP in order to provide per-flow entropy for load-
       balancing.  The method is targeted for use with softwire mesh
       deployments that include routers which have support for load-
       balancing based on UDP ports and not fields in L2TPv3 or GRE.

  "Automating DNSSEC delegation trust maintenance", Warren Kumari, Olafur
  Gudmundsson, George Barwood, 17-Jun-13,
  <draft-kumari-ogud-dnsop-cds-02.txt>

    This document describes a method to allow DNS operators to more
       easily update DNSSEC Key Signing Keys using DNS as communication
       channel.  This document does not address the initial configuration of
       trust anchors for a domain.

  "Conditional Enablement of Configuration Nodes", Kent Watsen, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-kwatsen-conditional-enablement-00.txt>

    This memo presents a cross-cutting technique whereby a NETCONF server
       can support conditional enablement of configuration nodes.  That is,
       whether the node is active or not depends on the evaluation of an
       expression.  Two expression types are defined herein, one for latent
       configuration (present but not actualized) and another for temporal
       configuration (actualized based on time).  This soluton presented is
       extensible so that additional expression types may be added in the
       future.

  "Requirements for the IETF Liaison Statement Tool", Eliot Lear, Spencer
  Dawkins, 18-Feb-13, <draft-lear-liaison-tool-rqts-00.txt>

    This memo specifies requirements for the liaison statement tool used
       by IETF working group chairs, IESG members, and the IAB, as well as
       representatives of organizations that liaise to these IETF entities.

  "Supporting Source-Multiplexing of the Real-Time Transport Protocol
  (RTP) Payload for Generic Forward Error Correction", Jonathan Lennox,
  18-Feb-13, <draft-lennox-payload-ulp-ssrc-mux-00.txt>

    The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Payload format for Generic
       Forward Error Correction (FEC), specified in RFC 5109, forbids
       transmitting FEC repair flows as separate sources in the same RTP
       session as the flows being repaired.  This document updates RFC 5109
       to lift that restriction, as long as the association between original
       and repair flows is properly signaled and negotiated.

  "A Taxonomy of Grouping Semantics and Mechanisms for Real-Time Transport
  Protocol (RTP) Sources", Jonathan Lennox, Kevin Gross, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-lennox-raiarea-rtp-grouping-taxonomy-00.txt>

    The terminology about, and associations among, Real-Time Transport
       Protocol (RTP) sources can be complex and somewhat opaque.  This
       document describes a number of existing and proposed relationships
       among RTP sources, and attempts to define common terminology for
       discussing protocol entities and their relationships.
    
       This document is still very rough, but is submitted in the hopes of
       making future discussion productive.

  "DHCPv6/SLAAC Address Configuration Interaction Problem Statement", Bing
  Liu, Ron Bonica, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-liu-bonica-dhcpv6-slaac-problem-01.txt>

    This document analyzes the host behavior of DHCPv6/SLAAC interaction
       issue. It reviews the standard definition of the host behaviors and
       provides the test results of current mainstream implementations. Some
       potential operational gaps of the interaction are also described.

  "Guidance of Using Unique Local Addresses", Bing Liu, Sheng Jiang,
  Cameron Byrne, 18-Feb-13, <draft-liu-ula-guide-00.txt>

    This document provides guidance of how to use ULA. It analyzes ULA
       usage scenarios and recommends use cases where ULA address may be
       beneficially used.

  "RSVP-TE Signaling Extension for Bandwidth availability", Hao Long, Min
  Ye, 18-Feb-13, <draft-long-ccamp-rsvp-te-bandwidth-availability-00.txt>

    Packet switching network usually contains links with variable
       bandwidth, e.g., copper, radio, etc. The bandwidth of such link is
       sensitive to external environment. Availability is typically used
       for describing the link during network planning. This document
       describes an extension for RSVP-TE signaling for setting up a LSP in
       a PSN network which contains variable bandwidth link by introducing
       an optional availability field in RSVP-TE signaling.

  "Considerations on IPv6 Address Assignment", Qiongfang Ma, Tianle Yang,
  18-Feb-13, <draft-ma-v6ops-ipv6-address-assignment-00.txt>

    This document discusses general principles and rules of IPv6 address
    assignment and gives an example to illustrate.

  "RTCWeb data channel management", Jerome Marcon, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-marcon-rtcweb-data-channel-management-00.txt>

    The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group is
       charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich
       communication using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-
       browsers.  For the support of data communication, the RTCWeb working
       group has in particular defined the concept of bi-directional data
       channels over SCTP.  How to transport application messages on these
       data channels seems straightforward (i.e. they can be carried as SCTP
       user messages), however it is yet to be decided how to establish and
       manage these data channels.  This document specifies a method for
       this, which relies first on a lightweight and scalable out-of-band
       negotiation of data channel configurations (within the SDP offer/
       answer exchange) and second on the signaling of the configuration in
       use in the SCTP user message itself.  Once these configurations are
       negotiated, further creations of data channels can occur purely in-
       band by simply sending user messages, which avoids to define a new
       in-band data channel protocol.

  "WebRTC audio codecs for interoperability with legacy networks.", Xavier
  Marjou, Stephane Proust, Kalyani Bogineni, Roland Jesske, Miao Lei,
  Enrico Marocco, Espen Berger, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-marjou-rtcweb-audio-codecs-for-interop-01.txt>

    This document presents use-cases underlining why WebRTC needs AMR-WB,
       AMR and G.722 as additional relevant voice codecs to satisfactorily
       ensure interoperability with existing systems.  It also presents a
       way forward that takes into consideration the concerns expressed
       against the addition of codecs besides Opus and G.711.
    
       It is especially recognized that unjustified additional costs on
       browsers must be avoided.  Therefore, the proposed solution intends
       to fully rely on the codecs already supported on the devices
       implementing the browsers and for which license and implementation
       costs have been already paid.
    
       It is expected that this way forward will significantly limit the
       costs and technical impacts on browsers while greatly improving
       interoperability with legacy systems and overall quality.  It intents
       to be considered as a good compromise beneficial to all parties and
       to the whole industry: the user quality experience will be optimized
       as a whole at limited additional costs without incurring high costs
       for both networks to support transcoding and browsers to support
       additional codecs.

  "Hash-Based Signatures", David McGrew, Michael Curcio, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-mcgrew-hash-sigs-01.txt>

    This note describes a digital signature system based on cryptographic
       hash functions, following the seminal work in this area.  It
       specifies a one-time signature scheme based on the work of Lamport,
       Diffie, Winternitz, and Merkle (LDWM), and specifies a general
       signature system using a Merkle tree.  These systems provide
       asymmetric authentication without using large integer mathematics and
       achieve a high security level.  They are suitable for compact
       implementations, are relatively simple to implement, and naturally
       resist side-channel attacks.  Unlike most other signature systems,
       hash-based signatures would still be secure even if it proves
       feasible for an attacker to build a quantum computer.

  "Topology API Requirements", Jan Medved, Stefano Previdi, Hannes
  Gredler, Thomas Nadeau, Shane Amante, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-medved-i2rs-topology-requirements-00.txt>

    This document describes requirements for collecting topology data
       from network elements and other sources, creating a coherent view of
       the network topology from the collected data, and presenting the
       topology view to various applications that need to: a) understand the
       topology; and, b) leverage topology information in order to improve
       application specific mechanisms such as path selection, resources
       reservation, etc.

  "Loss and Delay Measurement in Transparent Interconnection of Lots of
  Links (TRILL)", Tal Mizrahi, Tissa Senevirathne, Samer Salam, Donald
  Eastlake, 18-Feb-13, <draft-mizrahi-trill-loss-delay-00.txt>

    Performance Monitoring (PM) is a key aspect of Operations,
       Administration and Maintenance (OAM). It allows network operators to
       verify the Service Level Agreement (SLA) provided to customers, and
       to detect network anomalies. This document specifies mechanisms for
       Loss Measurement (LM) and Delay Measurement (DM) in TRILL networks.

  "A Framework for SDP Attributes when Multiplexing", Suhas Nandakumar,
  25-Apr-13, <draft-nandakumar-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes-02.txt,.pdf>

    The Session Description Protocol (SDP) provides mechanisms to
       describe attributes of multimedia sessions and of individual media
       streams (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within a
       multimedia session.  In the RTCWeb WG, there is a need to use a
       single 5-tuple for sending and receiving media associated with
       multiple media descriptions ("m=" lines).  Such a requirement has
       raised concerns over the semantic implications of the SDP attributes
       associated with the RTP Sessions multiplexed over a single transport
       layer flow.
    
       The scope of this specification is to provide a framework for
       analyzing the multiplexing characteristics of SDP attributes.  The
       specification also categorizes existing attributes based on the
       framework described herein.

  "Glareless addition of media to existing RTCWeb Sessions", Suhas
  Nandakumar, Cullen Jennings, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-nandakumar-rtcweb-glare-handling-00.txt,.pdf>

    The RFC3264 Offer/Answer model specifies rule for the bilateral
       exchange of Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] messages for
       setting up, updating and tearing down of multimedia streams.  Rarely,
       there might be situations wherein either of the communicating
       parties, might end up being the offerer for updating an on-going
       session.  This scenario is commonly known as "glare" condition and it
       needs to be handled nevertheless.  This specification describes
       procedures for parties involved in an ongoing RTCWeb session to add
       new media in a glareless fashion.
    
       There are various ways this problem might be solved - this draft
       sketches out one possible solution to the problem.

  "Common Template for HTTP Message-based Multi-hop Authentication",
  Yutaka Oiwa, Hajime Watanabe, Hiromitsu Takagi, Boku Kihara, Tatsuya
  Hayashi, Yuichi Ioku, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-oiwa-httpauth-multihop-template-00.txt,.ps,.pdf>

    This document specifies a common protocol design template for
       authentication on the Hyper-text Transport Protocol (HTTP) involving
       multi-hop message exchanges.  To facilitate advanced authentication
       technologies such as hash-based exchanges, zero-knowledge password
       proof, or public-key authentications on HTTP, a kind of state
       management and key management facilities are required on the general
       HTTP authentication message framework.  Also, to optimize performance
       of such authentication schemes, a well-designed mechanism for key
       caching and re-authentication are needed.  The template defined in
       this document provides a generic foundation for implementing such
       advanced authentication technologies.

  "On the Use of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Feedback for Unicast
  Multimedia Congestion Control", Colin Perkins, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-perkins-rmcat-rtp-cc-feedback-00.txt>

    This memo discusses the types of congestion control feedback that it
       is possible to send using the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and their
       suitability of use in implementing congestion control for unicast
       multimedia applications.

  "Using Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) with Session
  Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer and Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP)", Marc Petit-Huguenin, Ari Keranen, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-petithuguenin-mmusic-ice-sip-sdp-01.txt>

    This document describes how Interactive Connectivity Establishment
       (ICE) is used with Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer
       and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

  "Lawful-Intercept Support for SP Wi-Fi Deployments", Byju Pularikkal,
  Sri Gundavelli, Mark Grayson, Rajat Ghai, 13-Mar-13,
  <draft-pularikkal-opsawg-lawful-intercept-spwifi-01.txt>

    Lawful Intercept stands for legally authorized capture & delivery of
       subscriber communications data by a communications provider to a law
       enforcement agency.This document describes Generic Lawful Intercept
       Architecture Models & implementation considerations for Service
       Provider Wi-Fi deployments.

  "Entropy label for seamless MPLS", Ravi Singh, Yimin Shen, John Drake,
  18-Feb-13, <draft-ravisingh-mpls-el-for-seamless-mpls-00.txt>

    This document describes how entropy labels can be used for load
       balancing in a seamless MPLS architecture. The definition of the
       control plane and data plane behavior at LSP stitching points; and at
       the ingress of an LSP in a hierarchy of LSPs, as described in this
       document, brings the benefits of entropy labels to seamless MPLS as
       MPLS deployments proliferate in the access and aggregation networks.
    
       This document updates RFC 6790.

  "YANG modifications for I2RS", Rex Fernando, pals, Muthumayan Madhayyan,
  Alex Clemm, 18-Feb-13, <draft-rfernando-i2rs-yang-mods-00.txt>

    Interface to Routing Systems (I2RS) provides the mechanisms for the
       programmatic access of routing system components. YANG [RFC 6020] is
       a modeling language that is used to specify an external visible data
       model of sub-system - for defining both configuration and operational
       data held in the networking device. NETCONF is the protocol that is
       used to perform these configurations and accessing the operational
       data.
    
       This document proposes to use the YANG data modeling language for
       I2RS data models. It also proposes a set of YANG language changes to
       enable the I2RS data models for multi-client and programmatic access.
    
       This document also proposes the scope for the I2RS programmed data
       set on the Routing System and the necessary mechanisms for data
       synchronization.
    
       This document also recommends a binary encoding for "on-the-wire"
       transfer of the YANG data model elements instead of XML.

  "Virtual Topologies for Service Chaining in BGP IP VPNs", Rex Fernando,
  Dhananjaya Rao, Luyuan Fang, Maria Napierala, So Ning, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-rfernando-l3vpn-service-chaining-01.txt>

    This document presents the techniques built upon BGP/MPLS IP VPN
       control plane mechanisms to construct virtual service topologies for
       service chaining. These virtual service topologies allow a sequence
       of service nodes to be visited across multiple zones in a data center
       to form a service chain. The method uses service topology specific
       Route Targets (RTs) in addition to general purpose RTs. Provisioning
       with Software Defined Network (SDN) controller is discussed in this
       document.

  "Priority Modification for the PSC Linear Protection", Jeong-dong Ryoo,
  Huub van Helvoort, Alessandro D'Alessandro, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-rhd-mpls-tp-psc-priority-00.txt>

    This document contains the modifications to the priorities of inputs
       in [RFC6378], "MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection" in
       an effort to satisfy the ITU-T's protection switching requirements
       and correcting the problems that have been identified.

  "IP Inter-Subnet Forwarding in E-VPN", Ali Sajassi, Samer Salam, Yakov
  Rekhter, John Drake, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-inter-subnet-forwarding-01.txt>

    E-VPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution
       for intra-subnet connectivity among hosts/VMs over an MPLS/IP
       network. However, there are scenarios in which inter-subnet
       forwarding among hosts/VMs across different IP subnets is required,
       while maintaining the multi-homing capabilities of E-VPN. This
       document describes an IRB solution based on E-VPN to address such
       requirements.

  "Access Token as per Client Password for Non-Web Protocols", Nat
  Sakimura, Boku Kihara, Kazuki Shimizu, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-sakimura-oidc-extension-nonweb-01.txt>

    This specification describes the usage of the access token as a per
       client "password" for non-web clients that utilizes password based
       authentication, and the mechanism to issue such access tokens. Since
       the access token is used as the password for the client, the existing
       client application can be used as-is without any change, which is a
       considerable advantage for the deployment.

  "Structured Access Token for Sharing Authorization Grant between a
  Resource Server and an Authorization Server", Nat Sakimura, Boku Kihara,
  Kazuki Shimizu, 25-Feb-13, <draft-sakimura-oidc-structured-token-01.txt>

    This specification defines a format of structured access tokens that
       are issued by the authorization server and received by the resource
       server. By using this format, the authorization server and the
       resource server can be easily separated and the validation of the
       access token can be performed offline.

  "Security Bootstrapping Solution for Resource-Constrained Devices",
  Behcet Sarikaya, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-sarikaya-core-secure-bootsolution-00.txt>

    We present a solution to initially configure the network of resource
       constrained nodes securely, a.k.a., security bootstrapping.  The
       solution is based on EAP-TLS authentication with the use of raw
       public keys as certificates.

  "Virtual Machine Mobility Protocol Using Distributed Proxy Mobile IPv6",
  Behcet Sarikaya, Linda Dunbar, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-sarikaya-nvo3-vmm-dmm-pmip-00.txt>

    This document specifies a new IP level protocol for seamless virtual
       machine mobility in data centers.  Source Hypervisor registers the
       newly created virtual machine with the centrally available management
       node.  When the virtual machine moves to the destination Hypervisor,
       the destination Hypervisor updates the virtual machine record in the
       management node.  Management node sends registration message to all
       previous source Hypervisors in order to direct the ongoing traffic to
       the destination Hypervisor.  Cold and hot virtual machine mobility
       are achieved using dynamic domain name system update and host routes.
       Both intra data center and inter data center hot virtual machine
       mobility solutions are presented.

  "A Network Virtualization Overlay Solution using E-VPN", Ali Sajassi,
  John Drake, Nabil Bitar, Aldrin Isaac, James Uttaro, Wim Henderickx,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-sd-l2vpn-evpn-overlay-01.txt>

    This document describes how E-VPN can be used as an NVO solution and
       explores the various tunnel encapsulation options over IP  and their
       impact on the E-VPN control-plane and procedures. In particular, the
       following encapsulation options are analyzed: MPLS over GRE, VXLAN,
       and NVGRE.

  "ALTO for LMAP", Jan Seedorf, Vijay Gurbani, Enrico Marocco, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-seedorf-lmap-alto-00.txt>

    In the context of Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance
       (LMAP), measurment results are currently made available to the public
       either at the finest granularity level (e.g. as a list of results of
       all individual tests), or in a very high level human-readable format
       (e.g. as PDF reports).
    
       This document argues that there is a need for an intermediate way to
       provide access to large-scale network measurement results, flexible
       enough to enable querying of specific and possibly aggregated data.
       The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol, defined
       with the goal to provide applications with network information, seems
       a good candidate to fulfill such a role.

  "CoAP Communication with Alternative Transports", Bilhanan Silverajan,
  Teemu Savolainen, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-silverajan-core-coap-alternative-transports-01.txt>

    CoAP is being standardised as an application level REST-based
       protocol.  A single CoAP message is typically encapsulated and
       transmitted using UDP.  This draft examines the requirements and
       possible solutions for conveying CoAP packets to end points over
       alternative transports to UDP.  While UDP remains an optimal solution
       for use in IP-based constrained environments and nodes, M2M
       communication using non-IP networks, NAT and firewall traversal
       issues and possibly mechanisms incurring a lower overhead to CoAP/
       HTTP gateways provide compelling motivation for understanding how
       CoAP can operate in various other environments.

  "Infrastructure to Application Information Exposure", Haibin Song, Young
  Lee, 22-Feb-13, <draft-song-alto-i2rs-01.txt>

    This document describes the scenarios that applications can use the
       network layer especially the network routing system exposed
       information, so as to optimize application layer traffic.  The use
       cases in this document include the ISP broadband network (using P2P
       and CDN as examples) and the data center network.  This document
       also describes what information should be collected for
       ALTO service for traffic optimization.

  "A New Data Chunk for Stream Control Transmission Protocol", Randall
  Stewart, Michael Tuexen, Salvatore Loreto, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-stewart-tsvwg-sctp-ndata-01.txt>

    The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a message oriented
       transport protocol supporting arbitrary large user messages.
       However, the sender can not interleave different user messages which
       which causes head of line blocking at the sender side.  To overcome
       this limitation, this document adds a new data chunk to SCTP.

  "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) Option for IPv4
  Configuration", Qi Sun, Yong Cui, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-sun-dhc-dhcpv6-opt-v4config-00.txt>

    This document defines a DHCPv6 option with two types of sub-options
       for IPv4 configurations in the case of IPv4/IPv6 transition.  One is
       used for the assignment of IPv4 address and port set, the other is
       used for configuring existing DHCPv4 options required by clients for
       IPv4-over-IPv6 communications.

  "Make-Before-Break MPLS-TE LSP restoration and reoptimization procedure
  using Stateful PCE", Yosuke Tanaka, Yuji Kamite, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-tanaka-pce-stateful-pce-mbb-00.txt>

    Stateful PCE (Path Computation Element) and its corresponding
       protocol extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do
       stateful control of MPLS Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
       LSP).  Stateful PCE supports manipulating the existing LSP's state
       and attributes (e.g., bandwidth and route) and also creating totally
       new LSPs in the network.
    
       In the current MPLS TE network using RSVP-TE, LSPs are often
       controlled by "make-before-break (M-B-B)" signaling by headend for
       the purpose of LSP restoration and reoptimization.  In most cases, it
       is an essential operation to reroute LSP traffic without any data
       disruption.
    
       This document specifies the procedure of applying Stateful PCE's
       control to make-before-break RSVP-TE signaling.  In this document,
       two types of restoration/reoptimization procedures are defined, one-
       stroke mode and granular mode.  This document also specifies the
       usage and handling of stateful PCEP (PCE Communication Protocol)
       messages, expected behavior of PCC as RSVP-TE headend and several
       extensions of additional objects.

  "Experience of Designing Network Management System", Yasuhiro TERAMOTO,
  Ray Aatarashi, Yoshifumi Atarashi, Yasuo Okabe, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-teramoto-experience-network-management-01.txt>

    This document describes our experiences from designing and
       implementing a large-scale local area network management system using
       mainly NETCONF.  We designed the data models for device
       configurations and implemented NETCONF client to centrally control
       multiple devices of various vendors.  The document provides insight
       on strong and weak points of current NETCONF approach.  The document
       also makes some recommendations about NETCONF and future network
       management protocols.

  "Example IPR License Terms", Timothy Terriberry, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-terriberry-ipr-license-00.txt>

    This draft gives provides an example set of licensing terms for use
       in IPR disclosures that are compatible with the goals of the proposed
       video-codec working group for further discussion and refinement by
       participants at the IETF.  Although usage of such a license is
       strictly voluntary, the hope is that getting agreement on a set of
       terms before the bulk of the work begins will allow contributors to
       use a common license and minimize the amount of legal analysis that
       must be performed in order to deploy the codec.

  "Data Channels for RTCWEB", Martin Thomson, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-thomson-rtcweb-data-00.txt>

    RTCWEB have selected SCTP over DTLS over UDP with ICE for peer-to-
       peer data channels.  There is some debate over the best way to
       negotiate channels.  This proposal is a nose-to-tail description of
       an alternative to existing proposals.

  "IPv6 Multihoming with Source Address Dependent Routing (SADR)", Ole
  Troan, Lorenzo Colitti, 18-Feb-13, <draft-troan-homenet-sadr-00.txt>

    A multihomed network using provider aggregatable addresses must send
       the packet out the right path to avoid violating the provider's
       ingress filtering.  This memo suggests a mechanism called Source
       Address Dependent Routing to solve that problem.

  "Authentication Issues in Network Virtualization Overlays", Zehn Cao,
  Gang Chen, 18-Feb-13, <draft-tsao-nvo3-auth-issues-00.txt>

    This document describes the issues of authenticating a new end-device
       in a virtual data center.  This short document tries to initiate the
       discussion about the authentication issues in the virtualized data
       centers.

  "Diameter AVP Level Security: Requirements and Scenarios", Hannes
  Tschofenig, Jouni Korhonen, Glen Zorn, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-tschofenig-dime-e2e-sec-req-00.txt>

    This specification discusses requirements for providing Diameter
       security at the level of individual Attribute Value Pairs.

  "A Keying Database for Diameter End-to-End Security", Hannes Tschofenig,
  18-Feb-13, <draft-tschofenig-dime-keying-database-00.txt>

    The Diameter Base specification offers security protection between
       neighboring Diameter peers using TLS, DTLS, and IPsec.  The
       development of a solution to protect Diameter Attribute Value Pairs
       between non-neighboring nodes is currently work in progress.
    
       Diameter nodes maintain different types of databases, depending on
       their functions.  Examples include the peer table and the realm-based
       routing table.  This document describes a conceptual model for a
       keying database as it would be used by a Diameter node to determine
       what AVPs to protect, and what keys / algorithms to use.  On the
       receiving side it allows the receiving node to select the appropriate
       security association for verifying the protected AVPs.  The design is
       similar to IPsec and inspired by the routing protocol security key
       table.

  "OAuth 2.0: Audience Information", Hannes Tschofenig, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-tschofenig-oauth-audience-00.txt>

    The OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token specification allows any party in
       possession of a bearer token to get access to the associated
       resources (without demonstrating possession of a cryptographic key).
       To prevent misuse, two important security assumptions must hold:
       bearer tokens must be protected from disclosure in storage and in
       transport and the access token must only be valid for use with a
       specific resource server (the audience) and with a specific scope.
    
       This document defines a new header that is used by the client to
       indicate what resource server, as the intended recipient, it wants to
       access.  This information is subsequently also communicated by the
       authorization server securely to the resource server, for example
       within the audience field of the access token.

  "SCIM Profile For Enhancing Just-In-Time Provisioning", Mark Wahl,
  18-Feb-13, <draft-wahl-scim-jit-profile-00.txt>

    This document specifies a profile of the System for Cross-Domain
       Identity Management Protocol (SCIM) for use by servers which rely
       upon just-in-time provisioning patterns in a protocol (such as SAML)
       to create user accounts, and need an additional channel to be
       notified of changes to user accounts.

  "Container Resolution System in ICN", Rong Wang, Chunfeng Yao, Zhefeng
  Yan, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-wang-icnrg-container-resolution-system-00.txt,.pdf>

    We illustrate the architecture and mechanism of container resolution
       system, and to the protocol of resolving containers in ICN. The
       fundamental characters are:1)Use Interest and Data packet as the
       communication primitives, 2)Every routing node has FIB, CS, PIT
       tables to do packet routing and caching. Current NDN/CCN architecture
       does not require a resolution system. The routing is totally based on
       prefixes of content names, which causes scalability and mobility
       issues described in [Cisco-Name]. This draft addresses the
       aforementioned issues.

  "Use Cases for an Interface to the Routing System", Russ White, Susan
  Hares, Rex Fernando, 18-Feb-13, <draft-white-i2rs-use-case-00.txt,.pdf>

    Programmatic interfaces to provide control over individual forwarding
       devices in a network promise to reduce operational costs while
       improving scaling, control, and visibility into the operation of
       large scale networks.  To this end, several programmatic interfaces
       have been proposed.  OpenFlow, for instance, provides a mechanism to
       replace the dynamic control plane processes on individual forwarding
       devices throughout a network with off box processes that interact
       with the forwarding tables on each device.  Another example is
       NETCONF, which provides a fast and flexible mechanism to interact
       with device configuration and policy.
    
       There is, however, no proposal which provides an interface to all
       aspects of the routing systemas a system.  Such a system would not
       interact with the forwarding system on individual devices, but rather
       with the control plane processes already used to discover the best
       path to any given destination through the network, as well as
       interact with the routing information base (RIB), which feeds the
       forwarding table the information needed to actually switch traffic at
       a local level.
    
       This document describes a set of use cases such a system could
       fulfill.  It is designed to provide underlying support for the
       framework, policy, and other drafts describing the Interface to the
       Routing System (IRS).

  "Proposed Control Plane requirements for Network Virtualization
  Overlays", Qin Wu, 23-Apr-13, <draft-wu-nvo3-nve2nve-05.txt>

    This document focuses on control plane aspect related to both tenant
       system to NVE control interface and NVE to Network Virtualization
       Authority (NVA) control interface NVE use to enable communication
       between tenant systems, which is complementary to
       [draft-kreeger-nvo3-hypervisor-nve-cp] that describes the high level
       control plane requirements related to the interaction between tenant
       system and NVE when the two entities are not co-located on the same
       physical device.

  "RTP/RTCP extension for RTP Splicing Notification", Jinwei Xia, Rachel
  Huang, 20-Feb-13, <draft-xia-avtext-splicing-notification-01.txt>

    Content splicing is a process that replaces the content of a main
       multimedia stream with other multimedia content, and delivers the
       substitutive multimedia content to the receivers for a period of
       time.  The RTP mixer is designed to handle RTP splicing in [RFC6828],
       but how the RTP mixer knows when to start and end the splicing is
       still unspecified.
    
       This memo defines two RTP/RTCP extensions to indicate the splicing
       related information to the RTP mixer: an RTP header extension that
       conveys the information in-band and an RTCP packet that conveys the
       information out-of-band.

  "Coordinated Forwarding and Caching in Information-Centric Networks",
  Haiyong Xie, Yi Sun, Yunfei Zhang, Haibin Zhai, Hanwen Zhang, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-xie-icnrg-coordinated-caching-forwarding-00.txt>

    Content caching plays an important role in Information-Centric
       Networking (ICN).  Many of current ICN designs adopt a limited, en-
       route hierarchical caching mechanism; additionally, caching and
       forwarding are largely uncoordinated in these designs.  This draft
       describes a coordinated caching and forwarding design to improve
       content access cost and cache miss rate of ICN.

  "Scalable Hybrid Routing for Information-Centric Networks", Haiyong Xie,
  Yi Sun, Guoqiang Wang, Haibo Wu, Jun Li, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-xie-icnrg-hybrid-routing-00.txt>

    Name-based routing in information-centric networks faces many
       challenges, one of which is the scalability challenge; in particular,
       content routers may not have sufficiently large FIB to store a large
       portion of name prefixes, even if the latter are aggressively
       aggregated.  In many ICN designs routers have to rely on inefficient
       mechanisms (e.g., Interest broadcast in content-centric networks) in
       order to route requests.  In this draft, we describe a hybrid,
       reactive routing approach, where we augment the information-centric
       network design with an Infrastructure Information Base (IIB) to reap
       the benefits of both name-based and infrastructure-based routing.
       Simulation-based evaluations demonstrate that this scheme can
       significantly improve the network scalability by cutting down the
       number of broadcast packets while maintaining the same level of the
       user-perceived latency.

  "Two Dimensional-IP Routing Protocol in Home Networks", Mingwei Xu, Shu
  Yang, Jianping Wu, Dan Wang, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-xu-homenet-twod-ip-routing-00.txt>

    Home netowrk design faces many challenges currently.  Two of them are
       multi-homing and policy enforcement.  Different with other types of
       networks, home network operators are usually not professional
       technicians or geeks.  The problems we face are fundamentally related
       with the poor semantics provided by current destination-based routing
       protocol.
    
       TwoD-IP routing protocol is a link state routing protocol that makes
       routing decisions based on both destination and source addresses.
       This document describes the mechanism for supporting flexible multi-
       homing and policy routing across home networks.

  "DHCP option for STA Location Information", Li Xue, Behcet Sarikaya,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-xue-dhc-location-option-01.txt>

    This document introduces WTP information transported using DHCPv4/v6.
       In this procedure, DHCPv4/v6 snooping is deployed on the WTP node or
       AC node.  Then the WTP information can be inserted into the extension
       option of DHCPv4/v6 message.  GW obtain the WTP information of the
       subscriber through which the subscriber accesses network.

  "DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options for Access Point Location Information", Li
  Xue, Behcet Sarikaya, 18-Feb-13, <draft-xue-dhcp-location-option-00.txt>

    This document introduces Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access
       Points Wireless Termination Point information transported using DHCP.
       In this procedure, DHCP snooping is deployed on the Wireless
       Termination Point node or Access Controller node.  Then the Wireless
       Termination Point information can be inserted into the DHCP message
       in extension option.  Because the DHCP messages is send out from the
       subscriber, so binding between Wireless Termination Point information
       and subscriber is set up after this procedure.  Then Gateway obtains
       the Wireless Termination Point information through the subscriber
       access network.

  "RADIUS Extensions for Key Management in WLAN network", Li Xue,
  18-Feb-13, <draft-xue-radext-key-management-00.txt>

    In order to guarantee the security and integration of the subscriber
       in WLAN network, Pairwise Master Key (PMK) will be generated as an
       access authorization token during the mutual authentication procedure
       between station (STA) and authenticator server (AS).  Then, the PMK
       and 4-way handshake are used between STA and Authenticator to derive,
       bind and verify the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK), which is a
       collection of operational keys for security.  Also,Group Transient
       Key (GTK) can be derived, and is used to secure multicast/broadcast
       traffic.  In the authentication architecture, only STA and AS can
       manufacture PMK, moreover, AS can only distribute PMK to
       Authenticator.However, if the authenticator function is not
       collocated with the encryption/decryption function, it is difficult
       to achieve traffic encryption/decryption in WLAN network.The purpose
       of this document is to analyze the requirement and issue for key
       management that have arisen so far during STA authentication process
       in WLAN network.  Meanwhile, the control messages for key management
       are defined.

  "simple VPN solution using Multi-point Security Association", Arifumi
  Yamaya, Ken Ueki, Tomoki Murai, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-yamaya-ipsecme-mpsa-00.txt>

       dynamically established IPsec multi-point Security Association (SA)
       without individual connection.
    
       Multi-point SA technology provides the simplified mechanism of the
       Auto Discovery and Configuration function.
       This is applicable for any IPsec tunnels such as IPv4 over IPv4,
       IPv4 over IPv6, IPv6 over IPv4 and IPv6 over IPv6.

  "Container Assisted Naming and Routing for ICN", Chunfeng Yao, Rong
  Wang, Yuanzhe Xuan, Zhefeng Yan, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-yao-icnrg-naming-routing-00.txt,.pdf>

    In ICN (Information-centric network), everything is an identifiable
       object with a name, therefore the number of name prefixes is a few
       orders of magnitude higher than that in current BGP routing table.
       Towards scalable routing in ICN, we propose a name scheme, called
       container assisted  naming. With this scheme, an object name consists
       of two components: a content name which uniquely specifies the object
       within certain scope, and one or more containers which define access
       relationships to the object. This document illustrates the concept of
       container and how it assists scalable routing in ICN.

  "Managing SSH Keys for Automated Access - Current Recommended Practice",
  Tatu Ylonen, Greg Kent, 3-Apr-13, <draft-ylonen-sshkeybcp-01.txt>

    This document presents current recommended practice for managing SSH
       user keys for automated access.  It provides guidelines for
       discovering, remediating, and continuously managing SSH user keys and
       other authentication credentials.
    
       Various threats from poorly managed SSH keys are identified,
       including virus spread, unaudited backdoors, illegitimate access
       using leaked keys, lack of proper termination of access, use of
       legitimate access for unintended purposes, and accidental human
       errors.
    
       Hundreds of thousands, even over a million SSH keys authorizing
       access have been found from the IT environments of many large
       organizations.  This is many times more than they have interactive
       users.  These access-granting credentials have largely been ignored
       in identity and access management, and present a real risk to
       information security.
    
       A process is presented for discovering who has access to what,
       bringing an existing IT environment under control with respect to
       automated access and SSH keys.  The process includes moving
       authorized keys to protected locations, removing unused keys,
       associating authorized keys with a business process or application
       and removing keys for which no valid purpose can be found, rotating
       existing keys, restricting what can be done with each authorized key,
       and establishing an approval process for new authorized keys.  A
       process is also presented for continuous monitoring and controlled
       authorized key setup.
    
       Finally, recommendations are made for security policy makers for
       ensuring that automated access and SSH keys are properly addressed in
       an organization's security policy.
    
       Specific requirements are presented that address the security issues
       while keeping costs reasonable.
    
       Guidance is also provided on how to reduce operational cost while
       addressing the threats and how to use tools to automate the
       management process.

  "OSPF Extensions for Link State Database Synchronization Group", Gang
  Yan, Yuanjiao Liu, Xudong Zhang, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-ylz-ospf-lsdb-sync-group-00.txt>

    This document describes a special scheme of OSPF Database
       synchronization by dividing OSPF Routers into different groups and
       preventing OSPF Routers from different groups to synchronize, this
       scheme can help to enhance the number of OSPF adjacencies and the
       capability of deploying OSPF on large network.

  "Variant Label Resource Record", Yoshiro Yoneya, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-yoneya-dns-variant-label-rr-01.txt>

    Definition and operation of variant domain names are differ from zone
       administrators, and there is no generic rules, therefore, in general,
       it is hard to guess variant labels for end users and / or
       applications.  Meanwhile, zone administrators are understanding all
       variant labels list because they generate variant labels and activate
       them according to rules they defined.  Thus, if there is a mechanism
       that end users and / or applications can obtain variant labels list
       from zone administrators, then it would be useful.  The Variant
       Labels Resource Record (VL RR) provides such variant labels list for
       that purpose.

  "TRILL Over Pseudo Wires", Lucy Yong, Donald Eastlake, Sam Aldrin, Jon

       formats of searching and responding data structure and also proposes
       the specification of boolean search functionality.

  "IEEE 802.21 Overview", Juan Zuniga, Pierrick Seite, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-zuniga-mif-802-21-overview-00.txt>

    Some of the messages described in [I-D.ietf-mif-api-extension] may
       rely on functionalties provided by lower layers.  The IEEE 802.21
       specification defines an abstraction of lower layer functions that
       can be useful for the MIF-API.  This document provides an overview of
       the 802.21 specification and enumerates a subset of functions that
       can be used in the context of the MIF API to interact with lower
       layers.

    This document describes a way to implement Global Table Multicast,
       aka Internet Multicast, using BGP encodings and procedures for MVPN
       as specified in [RFC6514].
    
       No protocol modification/extension is required.  This is purely for
       informational and clarifying purposes only.

  "Network Management of Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET): Architecture, Use
  Cases, and Applicability", James Nguyen, Robert Cole, Ulrich Herberg,
  Jiazi Yi, Justin Dean, 19-Feb-13,
  <draft-nguyen-manet-management-00.txt,.pdf>

    This document aims at providing an extended architecture, use case
       and applicability statement for management of MANETs, as a guideline
       for how to manage MANETs.  This document describes different
       management activities, such as network configuration, monitoring of
       state, monitoring of performance, fault management, and software
       upgrades.  Different aspects of a MANET management architecture are
       illustrated (e.g., distributed vs. centralized management, flat vs.
       hierarchical management, management of an entire network vs. an
       individual router, etc.) and contrasted to the NMS architecture in
       the Internet.  A desciption of typical MANET use cases relevant for
       management is followed by an overview of current standard management
       protocols that can be used in MANETs.

  "PID: A Generic Naming Schema for Information-centric Network", Xinwen
  Zhang, Ravi Ravindran, Haiyong Xie, Guoqiang Wang, 20-Feb-13,
  <draft-zhang-icnrg-pid-naming-scheme-02.txt,.pdf>

    In Information-centric network (ICN), everything is an identifiable
       object with a name such as a named data chunk.  Different from host-
       centric connectivity, ICN connects named entities using name-based
       routing and forwarding.  At the same time, network entities, end
       devices, and applications have variant demands to verify the
       integrity and authenticity of these entities through names.  This
       document proposes a generic naming schema, called PID, which supports
       trust provenance, content lookup, routing, and inter-domain
       resolution for ICN.  With PID schema, a name consists of three
       components: principal(s), identifier(s), and domain(s).  In this
       draft, we only illustrate the principles and concepts of PID and the
       functional role of each component, and leave encoding approaches as
       implementation options.

  "A Policy Framework for the Interface to the Routing System", Alia
  Atlas, Susan Hares, Joel Halpern, 27-Feb-13,
  <draft-atlas-i2rs-policy-framework-00.txt,.pdf>

    A key aspect of the Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) is what
    mechanisms it includes to carry policy information and to enable
    policy control.  This applies both in the protocol itself and in the
    services associated with the different components of the routing
    system.  Similarly, the data-models associated with the services must
    be capable of expressing the appropriate granularity for access and
    authorization-related policy.  This document describes the policy
    framework for I2RS.

  "Interface to the Routing System Problem Statement", Alia Atlas, Thomas
  Nadeau, David Ward, 27-Feb-13,
  <draft-atlas-i2rs-problem-statement-00.txt>

    As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, the need for rapid
    and dynamic control increases.  With scale, the need to automate even
    the simplest operations is important, but even more critical is the
    ability to quickly interact with more complex operations such as
    policy-based controls.
    
    In order to enable applications to have access to and control over
    information in the Internet's routing system, we need a publicly
    documented interface specification.  The interface needs to support
    real-time, transaction-based interactions using data models and
    encodings that are efficient and potentially different from those
    available today.  Furthermore, the interface must be tailored to
    support a variety of use cases.
    
    This document expands upon these statements of requirements to
    provide a detailed problem statement for an Interface to the Internet
    Routing System (I2RS).

  "Interface to the Routing System Framework", Alia Atlas, Thomas Nadeau,
  David Ward, 27-Feb-13, <draft-ward-i2rs-framework-00.txt>

    This document describes a framework for a standard, programmatic
    interface for full-duplex state transfer in and out of the Internet's
    routing system.  It provides some basic use-cases, lists the type of
    information that might be exchanged over the interface, and describes
    suggested functionality for the interface to the Internet routing
    system.

  "Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol", Donald Slice, Steven
  Moore, James Ng, Russ White, Donnie, 28-Feb-13,
  <draft-savage-eigrp-00.txt>

    This document describes the protocol design and architecture for
    Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). EIGRP is a routing
    protocol based on Distance Vector technology. The specific algorithm
    used is called DUAL, a Diffusing UPDATE Algorithm[4]. The algorithm and
    procedures were researched, developed, and simulated by SRI
    International.

  "Multicast UDP Usage Guidelines for Application Designers", Greg
  Shepherd, 12-Jun-13, <draft-shepherd-multicast-udp-guidelines-01.txt>

    The multi-recipient nature of Multicast prevents the use of any pont-
       to-point connection-oriented transport, therefore restricts all
       Multicast data to be sent over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).  UDP
       provides a minimal message-passing transport that has no inherent
       congestion control mechanisms.  Because congestion control is
       critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and
       upper-layer protocols that choose to use Multicast UDP as an Internet
       service must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to
       establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic.  This
       document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of
       multicast applications and higher-level protocols.

  "PSC protocol updates for non-revertive operation", Tae-sik Cheung,
  Alessandro D'Alessandro, Huub van Helvoort, 10-Mar-13,

    This document contains the updates to [RFC6378], "MPLS Transport
       Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection" to change non-revertive
       operation to be aligned with the behavior defined in [RFC4427] and in
       an effort to satisfy the ITU-T's protection switching requirements.
       An operator command, Manual Switch to Working (MS-W) is also included
       to revert traffic to the working path in non-revertive operation.

  "Benchmarking Neighbor Discovery Problems", William Cerveny, 10-Mar-13,

       or performance of intermediate nodes.

  "Interoperability between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
  Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)", Chris Christou,
  Michael Lundberg, Christopher Ross, Peter Saint-Andre, 10-Mar-13,
  <draft-christou-sip-xmpp-interop-00.txt>

    This document is intended to serve as a reference point for
       developers and operators implementing the Session Initiation Protocol
       (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)
       within their networks.  This document does not define any new
       protocols but does define the different reference models for
       deployment of combined use of SIP and XMPP ("CUSAX") clients and SIP-
       XMPP interworking to ensure consistency across the community.

  "E164/214 MPBGP announcement", Shu Ge, 10-Mar-13,
  <draft-ge-mpbgp-e164e214-00.txt>

    Recently, transferring the signaling of mobile network over IP
       attracts lots of attention from people.  Telephone number based on
       E.164 or E.214 or SP is the traditional routing address for mobile
       network, but actually, E.164, E.214 and SP is not supported by MP-BGP
       protocol.
    
       This document presents a new way to support for routing the phone
       number based on E.164, E.214 or SP though MP-BGP, by extending the
       MP-BGP for the Phone Number Routing.  It can bring optimizing for the
       network architecture and improving efficiency.

  "Distributed Mobility Management: Service flows distribution and handoff
  technique based on MIPv6", Liu Min, Yuwei Wang, 10-Mar-13,
  <draft-liu-dmm-flows-distribution-and-handoff-00.txt>

    This document has a normative description of the service flows based
       on IPv6. It makes the upgrade of management model from the entire
       node granularity to the single service flow granularity, with the
       compatibility to the existing mobile IPv6. It shows a distributed,
       compatible with mobile IPv6 network layer mobility solution, which
       would take different mobility management strategies according to the
       Correspondent Node's position, network conditions and service
       requirements of the different service flows so as to achieve the
       service flow granularity switching and transmission path control. And
       the standard will also provide route optimization mechanism between
       the Mobile Node and the ordinary Correspondent Node that doesn't
       support mobile IPv6, playing a role in promoting the development of
       new applications and business based on mobile IPv6.

  "Instant Messaging and Presence Purpose for the Call-Info Header Field
  in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Peter Saint-Andre, 30-May-13,
  <draft-saintandre-impp-call-info-04.txt>

    This document defines and registers a value of "impp" ("instant
       messaging and presence protocol") for the "purpose" header field
       parameter of the Call-Info header field in the Session Initiation
       Protocol (SIP).

  "Multi-Upstream Interfaces IGMP/MLD Proxy", Hong-Ke Zhang, Thomas
  Schmidt, 10-Mar-13, <draft-zhang-pim-muiimp-00.txt>

    In this document, followed by the idea mentioned in [4] and
           subsequent update in [5], an IGMP/MLD proxy with multiple upstream
           interfaces called MUIIMP is proposed and analyzed. The MUIIMP
           inherits the basic rule of the IGMP/MLD proxy but extends with
           multiple  upstream  interfaces.  To  avoid  data  redundancy,  each
           upstream interface of an MUIIMP device MUST NOT send or subscribe
           the same data simultaneously.

  "Attribute-Value Pairs For Provisioning Customer Equipment Supporting
  IPv4-Over-IPv6 Transitional Solutions", Cathy Zhou, Tom Taylor,
  10-Mar-13, <draft-zhou-dime-4over6-provisioning-00.txt>

    During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, customer equipment may have
       to support one of the various transition methods that have been or
       are currently being defined for carrying IPv4 packets over IPv6.
       Work is currently in progress to enumerate the information that needs
       to be provisioned on a customer edge router to support a list of
       transition techniques based on tunneling IPv4 in IPv6, with a view to
       defining reusable components for a reasonable transition path between
       these techniques.  To the extent that the provisioning is done
       dynamically, AAA support is needed to provide the information to the
       network server responsible for passing the information to the
       customer equipment.  This document specifies Diameter attribute-value
       pairs to be used for that purpose.

  "mLDP extensions for integrating EVPN and multicast", David Allan, Jeff
  Tantsura, 11-Mar-13, <draft-allan-l2vpn-mldp-evpn-00.txt>

    This document describes how mLDP FECs can be encoded to support both
       service specific and shared multicast trees and describes the
       associated procedures for EVPN PEs. Thus, mLDP can implement
       multicast for EVPN.

  "LISP Based FlowMapping for Scaling NFV",  sbarkai@gmail.com, Dino
  Farinacci, David Meyer, Fabio Maino, Vina Ermagan, 22-May-13,
  <draft-barkai-lisp-nfv-01.txt>

    This draft describes an RFC 6830 Locator ID Separation Protocol
       (LISP) based distributed flow-mapping-fabric for dynamic scaling of
       virtualized network functions (NFV).  Network functions such as
       subscriber-management, content-optimization, security and quality of
       service, are typically delivered using proprietary hardware
       appliances embedded into the network as turn-key service-nodes or
       service-blades within routers.  Next generation network functions are
       being implemented as pure software instances running on standard
       servers - unbundled virtualized components of capacity and
       functionality.  LISP-SDN based flow-mapping, dynamically assembles
       these components to whole solutions by steering the right traffic in
       the right sequence to the right virtual function instance.

  "Autonomous Extensible Internet with Network Address Translation(AEIP
  NAT)", Diao Yongping, Ming Liao, Yuping Diao, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-diao-aeip-nat-00.txt>

    The two key issues of today's Internet are autonomy and
       extensibility. Autonomous Internet(AIP) technology can provide
       extensible internet architecture, own independent root DNS servers
       and self management internet network; Furthermore, based on the
       Autonomous Internet, here provides a way with extensible address
       capacity to solve IP address deficiency and realize
       Autonomous Extensible Internet(AEIP). It mainly adopts local
       network address based on per Autonomous IP network and uses
       bilateral dynamic NAT with global network address between
       Autonomous IP networks to solve IP address deficient problem.
       This AEIP with Network Address Translation(AEIP NAT) can realize
       autonomy and extensibility with minimal cost.

  "Advice on network buffering", Gorry Fairhurst, Bob Briscoe, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-fairhurst-tsvwg-buffers-00.txt>

    This document proposes an update to the advice given in RFC 3819.
       Subsequent research has altered understanding of buffer sizing and
       queue management.  Therefore this document significantly revises the
       previous recommendations on buffering.  The advice applies to all
       packet buffers, whether in network equipment, end hosts or
       middleboxes such as firewalls or NATs.  And the advice applies to
       packet buffers at any layer: whether subnet, IP, transport or
       application.

  "Delay Tolerant Networking Email Convergence Layer Protocol", Bjoern
  Gernert, Sebastian Schildt, 23-Apr-13,
  <draft-gernert-dtnrg-mailcl-01.txt>

    This document describes the protocol for the Email-based Convergence
       (MCL) Layer for Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN).

  "Painless Class 1 Devices Programming", Oliver Hahm, Emmanuel Baccelli,
  Kaspar Schleiser, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-hahm-lwig-painless-constrained-programming-00.txt>

    In order to fit the constraints of Class 0 devices (offering much
       less than 10KiB of RAM and 100KiB of ROM) there are no alternatives
       to implementing IP protocols in special software environments, which
       impose programming paradigms that make implementation of protocol
       specifications significantly more complex.  However, our experience
       implementing RFC 4944 and RFC 6282, TCP and UDP on Class 1 devices
       (offering approximately 10KiB of RAM and 100KiB of ROM) shows that
       there are alternatives concerning software environments in which to
       implement IP protocols, which avoid such complexity by providing a
       more developer-friendly environment.  This draft shares this
       experience.

  "I2RS overlay use case", fangwei hu, Bhumip Khasnabish, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-hu-i2rs-overlay-use-case-00.txt>

    This document proposes an overlay network use case.  The forwarding
       routers network is an overlay structure.  There are two kinds of
       forwarding routers: Edge Router(ER) and Core Routers(CR).  Edge
       Router encapsulates format data based on the tunnel type, which are
       established among Edge Routers.  Core Router would be very simple and
       cheap.  It focus on the encapsulation data forwarding.  In order to
       reduce the equipment cost of Edge Routers, the network virtualization
       is provided in this document.

  "RTCWEB Considerations for NATs, Firewalls and HTTP proxies", Thomas
  Stach, Andrew Hutton, Justin Uberti, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-hutton-rtcweb-nat-firewall-considerations-00.txt>

    This document describes mechanism to enable media stream
       establishment in the presence of NATs, firewalls and HTTP proxies.
       HTTP proxy and firewall policies applied in many private network
       domains introduce obstacles to the successful establishment of media
       stream via RTCWEB.  This document examines some of these policies and
       develops requirements on the web browsers designed to provide the
       best possible chance of media connectivity between RTCWEB peers.

  "Use Cases for an Interface to BGP Protocol", Keyur Patel, Rex Fernando,
  Hannes Gredler, Shane Amante, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-keyupate-i2rs-bgp-usecases-00.txt>

    A network routing protocol like BGP is typically configured and
       results of its operation are analyzed through some form of Command
       Line Interface (CLI) or NETCONF.  These interactions to control BGP
       and diagnose its operation encompass: configuration of protocol
       parameters, display of protocol data, setting of certain protocol
       state and debugging of the protocol.
    
       Interface to the Routing System's (I2RS) Programmatic interfaces, as
       defined in [I-D.ward-i2rs-framework], provides an alternate way to
       control the configuration and diagnose the operation of the BGP
       protocol.  I2RS may be used for the configuration, manipulation,
       polling or analyzing protocol data.  This document describes set of
       use cases for which I2RS can be used for BGP protocol.  It is
       intended to provide a base for the solution draft describing a set of
       interfaces to the BGP protocol.

  "Mark and Signed Mark Objects Mapping", Gustavo Lozano, 25-Mar-13,
  <draft-lozano-tmch-smd-02.txt>

    This document describes the format of a mark and a digitally signed
       mark, referred to as a signed mark and the Signed Mark Data (SMD)
       file as defined by the ICANN Trademark Clearinghouse.

  "pNFS Metadata Striping", Matt Benjamin, Casey Bodley, Adam Emerson,
  Peter Honeyman, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-mbenjamin-nfsv4-pnfs-metastripe-00.txt>

    This Internet-Draft describes a means to add metadata striping to
       pNFS.  The text of this draft is substantially based on prior drafts
       by Eisler, M., with some departures.  The current draft attempts to
       define a somewhat lighter-weight protocol, in particular, seeks to
       permit striping for ?filehandle only? operations such as LOCK and
       OPEN + CLAIM_FH, without clients having to obtain metadata layouts on
       regular files.  We gratefully acknowledge the primary contributions
       of Mike Eisler, Pranoop Ersani, and others.

  "Terminology in IPv6 over Time Slotted Channel Hopping", Maria
  Palattella, Pascal Thubert, Thomas Watteyne, Qin Wang, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-palattella-6tsch-terminology-00.txt>

    6TSCH proposes an architecture for an IPv6 multilink subnet that is
       composed of a high speed powered backbone and a number of
       IEEE802.15.4e TSCH wireless networks attached and synchronized by
       backbone routers.  This document extends existing terminology
       documents available for Low-power and Lossy Networks to provide
       additional terminology elements.

  "Header Diff: A compact HTTP header representation for HTTP/2.0", Herve
  Ruellan, Jun Fujisawa, Romain Bellessort, Youenn Fablet, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-ruellan-headerdiff-00.txt>

    This document describes a format adapted to efficiently represent
       HTTP headers in the context of HTTP/2.0.

  "Augmented Password-Authenticated Key Exchange for Transport Layer
  Security (TLS)", SeongHan Shin, Kazukuni Kobara, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-shin-tls-augpake-00.txt>

    This document describes an efficient augmented password-authenticated
       key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user remembers a low-entropy
       password and its verifier is registered in the intended server.  In
       general, the user password is chosen from a small set of dictionary
       whose space is within the off-line dictionary attacks.  The AugPAKE
       protocol described here is secure against passive attacks, active
       attacks and off-line dictionary attacks (on the obtained messages
       with passive/active attacks), and also provides resistance to server
       compromise (in the context of augmented PAKE security).  Based on the
       AugPAKE protocol, this document also specifies a new password-only
       authentication handshake for Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

  "An Architecture for IPv6 over Time Slotted Channel Hopping", Pascal
  Thubert, Robert Assimiti, Thomas Watteyne, 19-Apr-13,
  <draft-thubert-6tsch-architecture-01.txt>

    This document presents an architecture for an IPv6 multilink subnet
       that is composed of a high speed powered backbone and a number of
       IEEE802.15.4e TSCH wireless networks attached and synchronized by
       Backbone Routers.  Route Computation may be achieved in a centralized
       fashion by a Path Computation Element, in a distributed fashion using
       the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks, or in a mixed
       mode.  The Backbone Routers perform proxy Neighbor discovery
       operations over the backbone on behalf of the wireless device, so
       they can share a same subnet and appear to be connected to the same
       backbone as classical devices.

  "6tus Layer Specification", Qin Wang, Xavier Vilajosana, Thomas
  Watteyne, 23-May-13, <draft-wang-6tsch-6tus-01.txt>

    The recently published [IEEE802154e] standard formalizes the concept
       of link-layer resources in LLNs.  Nodes are synchronized and follow a
       schedule.  A time slot in that schedule corresponds to an atomic
       link-layer resource, and can be allocated to any pair of neighbors in
       the network.  This allows the schedule to be built to tightly match
       each node's bandwidth, latency and energy constraints, while ensuring
       collision-free communication.  The [IEEE802154e] standard does not,
       however, present a mechanism to do so, as building and managing the
       schedule is out of the standard's scope.  Routing layers such as the
       IETF IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) provide a mechanism to
       route multipoint-to-point traffic (from devices inside the LLN
       towards a central control point) and point-to-multipoint traffic
       (from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN).
       Network layer overlays cannot be optimized and adapted to take
       advantage of the cell-based topology created by the underlying TSCH
       MAC layer as a missing set of functionalities need to be defined.
       This document describes the 6tus layer and the main commands it
       provides to upper network layers such as RPL or GMPLS.  The set of
       functionalities includes feedback metrics from cell states so network
       layers can take routing decisions, TSCH configuration and control
       procedures, and the support for centralized and decentralized
       scheduling policies.

  "ISSU Benchmarking Methodology", Sarah Banks, Fer, Gery Czirjak, Ramdas
  Machat, 4-Jun-13, <draft-banks-bmwg-issu-meth-01.txt>

    Modern forwarding devices attempt to minimize any control and data
          plane disruptions while performing planned software changes, by
          implementing a technique commonly known as an In Service Software
          Upgrade (ISSU).
    
       This document specifies a set of common methodologies and procedures
          designed to characterize the overall behavior of a Device Under Test
          (DUT) subject to an ISSU event.

  "Default Border Definition", Erik Kline, 12-Mar-13,
  <draft-kline-homenet-default-perimeter-00.txt>

    Automatic, simple identification of when traffic is crossing a
       perimeter is highly desirable for a variety of home network uses.
       This document describes how to use homenet routing protocol
       adjacencies as the primary signal of a common administrative domain
       (e.g. "the home").  Classification of interfaces et cetera as
       internal or external follow from this, as do various policy and
       implementation implications.  One fundamental implication is that the
       active definition of a home network's interior is no more secure than
       its policy for forming homenet routing protocol adjacencies.

  "Multipath RTP based on RTP Relay Application (MPRTP-RA)", Lei Weimin,
  Wei Zhang, Shaowei Liu, 12-Mar-13, <draft-leiwm-avtcore-mprtp-ra-00.txt>

    This document defines the framework of multipath transmission of real-time
       media based on relay. The framework allows participants to use multiple
       paths,including the default IP path and relay paths, to transport media in a
       RTP session. A relay path may via one or more RTP relay nodes which provide
       relay services for media data. This framework describes function blocks and
       behaviors of MPRTP-RA-capable RTP agent and RTP relay. The framework also
       defines multipath transport protocol by extending RTP, and relay control
       protocol named OpenPath.

  "TMCH functional specifications", Gustavo Lozano, 13-May-13,
  <draft-lozano-tmch-func-spec-06.txt>

    This document describes the requirements, the architecture and the
       interfaces between the Trademark Clearing House (TMCH) and Domain
       Name Registries as well as between the TMCH and Domain Name
       Registrars for the provisioning and management of domain names during
       Sunrise and Trademark Claims Periods.

  "Segment Routing with IS-IS Routing Protocol", Stefano Previdi, Clarence
  Filsfils, Ahmed Bashandy, Martin Horneffer, Bruno Decraene, Stephane
  Litkowski, Igor Milojevic, Rob Shakir, Saku Ytti, Wim Henderickx, Jeff
  Tantsura, 21-Mar-13,
  <draft-previdi-filsfils-isis-segment-routing-02.txt>

    Segment Routing (SR) enables any node to select any path (explicit or
       derived from IGPs SPT computations) for each of its traffic classes.
       The path does not depend on a hop-by-hop signaling technique (neither
       LDP nor RSVP).  It only depends on a set of "segments" that are
       advertised by the IS-IS routing protocol.  These segments act as
       topological sub-paths that can be combined together to form the
       desired path.
    
       There are two forms of segments: node and adjacency.  A node segment
       represents a path to a node.  An adjacency segment represents a
       specific adjacency to a node.  A node segment is typically a multi-
       hop path while an adjacency segment is a one-hop path.  SR's control-
       plane can be applied to IPv6 and MPLS dataplanes.
    
       Segment Routing control-plane can be applied to the MPLS dataplane: a
       node segment to node N is instantiated in the MPLS dataplane as an
       LSP along the shortest-path (SPT) to the node.  An adjacency segment
       is instantiated in the MPLS dataplane as a cross-connect entry
       pointing to a specific egress datalink.
    
       This document describes the Segment Routing functions, a set of use
       cases it addresses and the necessary changes that are required in the
       IS-IS protocol.

  "Supporting the Signal Degrade in the PSC Linear Protection", Jeong-dong
  Ryoo, Huub van Helvoort, Alessandro D'Alessandro, 12-Mar-13,
  <draft-rhd-mpls-tp-psc-sd-00.txt>

    This document contains the updates to [RFC6378], "MPLS Transport
       Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection" to support protection against
       signal degrade (SD) in an effort to satisfy the ITU-T's protection
       switching requirements.

  "HTTP/2.0 Discussion: Using Multiple Request URI's in Idempotent and
  Safe Requests", James Snell, 12-Mar-13,
  <draft-snell-httpbis-mget-00.txt>

    This memo describes a proposed mechanism for specifying multiple
       request URI's within Idempotent methods (i.e.  "Multi-GET", "Multi-
       Delete")

  "Upgrading the 100-CONTINUE status for Broadcast in HTTP/1.1 Protocol",
  Raji Sankar, 13-Mar-13, <draft-bt-http-broadcast-00.txt,.pdf>

    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 in RFC 2616 uses the
       100-Continue status message with Expect: Continue header to send
       request body at a later time to the origin server.  This memo
       explains how to extend this status message to send multiple responses
       from the origin server to the client for an extended period of time.
       This achieves the essential function of broadcast from the origin
       server to the client, without the client waiting for a response to a
       request.

  "VPLS external Loop Protection Mechanism (VLPM)", Richard Boldy,
  2-May-13, <draft-l2vpn-vlpm-02.txt>

    In reference and response to draft-boldy-l2vpn-vplsloop-req-01,
        this document describes a solution in the form of a protocol
        function named VPLS External Loop Protection Mechanism (VLPM).
    
        VLPM is a protocol for a service provider to deploy at the PE to
        detect layer-2 loops in any external layer-2 segments (customer LAN)
        where customer deployed loop prevention methods may have failed.
    
        After detection of such a loop it facilitates configurable actions
        to protect the rest of the VPLS Domain from being affected without
        the need for inter-operation with customer network protocols, other
        VPLS PEs or sites.

  "Authentication-Results Registration for S/MIME signature verification",
  Alexey Melnikov, 19-Apr-13,
  <draft-melnikov-authentication-results-smime-01.txt>

    RFC 5451 specifies the Authentication-Results header field for
       conveying results of message authentication checks.  This document
       defines a new authentication method to be used in the Authentication-
       Results header field for S/MIME related signature checks.

  "A Framework for Measuring Network Complexity", Alvaro Retana, Russ
  White, 14-Mar-13, <draft-retana-network-complexity-framework-00.txt>

    Network architecture revolves around the concept of fitting the
       design of a network to its purpose; of asking the question, "what
       network will best fit these needs?"  A part of fitting network design
       to requirements is the problem of complexity, an idea often measured
       by "seat of pants" methods.  When would adding a particular protocol,
       policy, or configuration be "too complex?"  This document suggests a
       series of continuums along which network complexity might be
       measured.  No suggestions are made in measuring complexity for each
       of these continuums are provided; this is left for future documents.

  "IETF Recommendations Regarding Active Queue Management", Fred Baker,
  23-Apr-13, <draft-baker-aqm-recommendation-01.txt>

    This memo presents recommendations to the Internet community
       concerning measures to improve and preserve Internet performance.  It
       presents a strong recommendation for testing, standardization, and
       widespread deployment of active queue management in routers, to
       improve the performance of today's Internet.  It also urges a
       concerted effort of research, measurement, and ultimate deployment of
       router mechanisms to protect the Internet from flows that are not
       sufficiently responsive to congestion notification.
    
       The note largely repeats the recommendations of RFC 2309, updated
       after fifteen years of experience and new research.

  "HTTP Client Hints", Ilya Grigorik, 15-Mar-13,
  <draft-grigorik-http-client-hints-00.txt>

    An increasing diversity of connected device form factors and software
       capabilities has created a need to deliver varying, or optimized
       content for each device.
    
       Client Hints can be used as input to proactive content negotiation;
       just as the Accept header allowed clients to indicate what formats
       they prefer, Client Hints allow clients to indicate a list of device
       and agent specific preferences.

  "The Salsa20 Stream Cipher for Transport Layer Security", Simon
  Josefsson, Joachim Strombergson, Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos, 9-Apr-13,
  <draft-josefsson-salsa20-tls-02.txt>

    This document describe how the Salsa20 stream cipher can be used in
       the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer
       Security (DTLS) protocols.

  "XML Schemas for Reverse DNS Management", Terry Manderson, 19-Mar-13,
  <draft-manderson-rdns-xml-01.txt>

    This document defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema for
    Reverse DNS Management in a tightly controlled Representational State
    Transfer (REST) environment.  This document describes a schema that
    has been developed and deployed by ICANN in a "RESTful" based system
    since 2011 and is being used by the registries responsible for
    reverse DNS (rDNS) delegations underneath IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA
    through an X.509 certificate mediated HTTPS transaction.

  "Resource Records for EUI-48 and EUI-64 Addresses in the DNS", Joe
  Abley, 12-Jun-13, <draft-jabley-dnsext-eui48-eui64-rrtypes-05.txt>

    48-bit Extended Unique Identifiers (EUI-48) and 64-bit Extended
       Unique Identifiers (EUI-64) are address formats specified by the IEEE
       for use in various layer-2 networks, e.g.  Ethernet.
    
       This document describes two new DNS resource record types, EUI48 and
       EUI64, for encoding Ethernet addresses in the DNS.
    
       This document describes potentially severe privacy implications
       resulting from indiscriminate publication of link-layer addresses in
       the DNS.  This document recommends that EUI-48 or EUI-64 addresses
       SHOULD NOT be published in the public DNS.  This document specifies
       an interoperable encoding of these address types for use in private
       DNS namespaces, where the privacy concerns can be constrained and
       mitigated.

  "A SASL and GSS-API Mechanism for the BrowserID Authentication
  Protocol", Luke Howard, Nico Williams, 25-Apr-13,
  <draft-howard-gss-browserid-04.txt>

    This document defines protocols, procedures and conventions for a
       Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
       security mechanism based on the BrowserID authentication mechanism.
       Through the GS2 family of mechanisms defined in RFC 5801, these
       protocols also define how Simple Authentication and Security Layer
       (SASL, RFC 4422) applications may use BrowserID.

  "A Liveness Protocol for PSC", Eric Osborne, 19-Mar-13,
  <draft-osborne-mpls-psc-alive-00.txt>

    This document adds a liveness protocol to PSC which provides
       functionality similar to APS's EXER command.  It also provides some
       rules for processing TLVs in PSC messages which apply to all future
       uses of PSC TLVs.

  "Software-Defined Networking: A Service Provider's Perspective", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet, 5-Jun-13,
  <draft-sin-sdnrg-sdn-approach-03.txt>

    Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been one of the major buzz
       words of the networking industry for the past couple of years.  And
       yet, no clear definition of what SDN actually covers has been broadly
       admitted so far.  This document aims at contributing to the
       clarification of the SDN landscape by discussing a service provider's
       perspective on requirements, issues and other considerations about
       SDN.
    
       It is not meant to endlessly discuss what SDN truly means, but rather
       to suggest a functional taxonomy of the techniques that can be used
       under a SDN umbrella and to elaborate on the various pending issues
       the combined activation of such techniques inevitably raises.  As
       such, a definition of SDN is only mentioned for the sake of
       clarification.

  "JOSE Security Parameters Index", Richard Barnes, 21-Mar-13,
  <draft-barnes-jose-spi-00.txt>

    The use cases for JOSE include cases where a given sender and
       receiver use an out-of-band mechanism to negotiate cryptographic
       parameters, so that these parameters do not have to appear in a JOSE
       object.  This document proposed a modification to the JOSE formats to
       allow for signaling that pre-negotiated parameters are being used,
       and if so, which parameters.

  "VPLS External Loop Detection and Protection Requirements", Richard
  Boldy, 22-Mar-13, <draft-boldy-l2vpn-vplsloop-req-01.txt>

    Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) implementations, as defined in
        [RFC4761] and [RFC4762], are highly susceptible to layer-2 loops
        external to the PE customer-facing interface. Such loops impact
        performance and can have a detrimental affect on all VPLS traffic
        throughout the entire instance under certain conditions.
    
        Current Layer-2 loop detection and protection mechanisms do not
        function effectively here.
    
        This document describes the requirements for a protocol function
        to offer VPLS service providers a mechanism for detecting such
        layer-2 loops and facilitating configurable actions without the
        need for inter-operation with customer network protocols, other
        VPLS PEs or customer sourced frames.

  "Mounting YANG-Defined Information from Remote Datastores", Alex Clemm,
  Jan Medved, Eric Voit, 21-Mar-13, <draft-clemm-netmod-mount-00.txt>

    This document introduces a new capability that allows YANG datastores
       to reference and incorporate information from remote datastores.
       This is accomplished using a new YANG data model that allows to
       define and manage datastore mount points that reference data nodes in
       remote datastores.  The data model includes a set of YANG extensions
       for the purposes of declaring such mount points.

  "EUI-48 and EUI-64 Address Assignments for use in Documentation", Joe
  Abley, 21-Mar-13, <draft-jabley-eui48-eui64-doc-addr-00.txt>

    48-bit Extended Unique Identifiers (EUI-48) and 64-bit Extended
       Unique Identifiers (EUI-64) are address formats specified by the IEEE
       for use in various layer-2 networks, e.g. ethernet.
    
       This document describes an allocation of EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses
       under the IANA Organisationally Unique Identifier (OUI) to be used
       for the purposes of documentation.

  "The Interconnection and Interoperability of Different Cloud-office
  Applications (IDCOA) with the HTML File Format", Zhun Guo, 22-Mar-13,
  <draft-guo-idoca-with-the-html-file-format-00.txt>

    At present, the collaboration of documents in a single cloud-office
       Website works wonderfully.  However, the one among different cloud-
       office websites is a little clumsy.  This document analyzes the
       status quo of the collaboration of documents among those existing
       different cloud-office websites and provides a solution how to
       realize IDCOA (the interconnection and interoperability of different
       cloud-office applications) with the html file format.

  "A Summary of Various Mechanisms Deployed at L-Root for the
  Identification of Anycast Nodes", Joe Abley, 27-Mar-13,
  <draft-jabley-dnsop-anycast-mapping-01.txt>

    Anycast is a deployment technique commonly employed for
    authoritative-only servers in the Domain Name System (DNS).  L-Root,
    one of the thirteen root servers, is deployed in this fashion.
    
    Various techniques have been used to map deployed anycast
    infrastructure externally, i.e. without reference to inside knowledge
    about where and how such infrastructure has been deployed.
    Motivations for performing such measurement exercises include
    operational troubleshooting and infrastructure risk assessment.  In
    the specific case of L-Root, the ability to measure and map anycast
    infrastructure using the techniques mentioned in this document is
    provided for reasons of operational transparency.
    
    This document describes all facilities deployed at L-Root to
    facilitate mapping of its infrastructure and serves as documentation
    for L-Root as a measurable service.

  "Architecture Discussion of I2RS", Dapeng Liu, Hui Deng, 25-Mar-13,

  "Service Coverage Scope for Service URN", Daniel Mongrain, 25-Mar-13,
  <draft-mongrain-ecrit-service-coverage-scope-urn-00.txt>

    This document specifies a mechanism to specify a Service Coverage
       Scope in a Service URN [RFC5031] when multiple providers provide the
       same service for the same location.

  "X.509v3 TLS Feature Extension", Phillip Hallam-Baker, 24-Apr-13,
  <draft-hallambaker-tlsfeature-02.txt,.pdf>

    The purpose of the TLS Feature extension is to prevent downgrade
       attacks that are not otherwise prevented by the TLS protocol.  In
       particular, the TLS Feature extension may be used to mandate support
       for revocation checking features in the TLS protocol such as OCSP
       stapling.  Informing clients that an OCSP status response will always
       be stapled permits an immediate failure in the case that the response
       is not stapled.  This in turn prevents a denial of service attack
       that might otherwise be possible.

  "Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) Domain Name Mapping Extension
  for Chinese Domain Names", Zheng Wang, 27-Mar-13,
  <draft-wang-epp-cdn-mapping-00.txt>

    This document describes an extension of Extensible Provisioning
       Protocol (EPP) domain name mapping for the provisioning and
       management of Chinese Domain Names (CDNs). Specified in XML, this
       extended mapping is applied to provide additional features required
       by CDNs Registration.

  "Multiplexing Negotiation Using ICE Candidate Extension", Andrew Hutton,
  Thomas Stach, 28-Mar-13,
  <draft-hutton-mmusic-bundled-ice-candidates-00.txt,.pdf>

    This document describes a mechanism for extending ICE candidates with
       an optional parameter which can be used to negotiate the usage of
       bundled media, which refers to the usage of a single 5-tuple for
       multiple RTP streams.  In a scenario where a party initiating the
       negotiation supports ICE [RFC5245] this mechanism provides the
       ability to provide an SDP offer which is both backwards compatible
       and able to fully specify the use of bundled media.  Therefore, this
       mechanism allows bundled and non-bundled media to be negotiated in a
       single offer/answer exchange when both parties support ICE and this
       extension.  The mechanism complements the procedures described in
       [draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation].

  "Carrier-Grade-NAT (CGN) Deployment Considerations.", Kaname Nishizuka,
  28-Mar-13, <draft-nishizuka-cgn-deployment-considerations-00.txt>

    This document provides deployment considerations for Carrier-Grade-
       NAT (CGN) based on the verification result include the investigation
       of the number of sessions of applications.  The verification was
       conducted in StarBED which is one of the largest scale network
       experiment environment in Japan.  A million of subscribers was
       emulated and it revealed the realistic behavior of CGN.

  "MLDv2 Procedures for Link-Layer Unicast Delivery of Multicast IPv6",
  Mark Smith, 28-Mar-13, <draft-smith-mldv2-link-unicast-00.txt>

    Some multi-access link-layer technologies typically not provide good
       IPv6 multicast performance, using link-layer multicasts, when the
       volume of multicast traffic is significant.  It would be possible to
       replicate and then link-layer unicast multicast IPv6 traffic to
       interested listeners to overcome these link-layer performance
       limitations.  This memo describes MLDv2 and IPv6 neighbor discovery
       procedures to support link-layer unicast delivery of multicast IPv6
       traffic.

  "ULA IPv6 Address Prefix Reserved for Documentation", Owen, 29-Mar-13,
  <draft-delong-ula-example-00.txt>

    To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating
       documented examples to deployed systems, an IPv6 Unicast Address
       prefix is reserved for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation,
       and the like.
    
       Since the publication of [RFC 4193] (ULA), it is necessary to
       provide examples of ULA addresses in various documents, including
       some Internet-Drafts currently under consideration.
    
       This draft seeks to add ULA prefixes reserved for documentation
       purposes similar to the GUA reservation specified in [RFC3489]

  "Why Reactive Protocols are ill-suited for LLNs", Joydeep Tripathi, Jau,
  JP Vasseur, 29-Mar-13,
  <draft-tripathi-roll-reactive-applicability-00.txt>

    This document describes serious issues regarding the use of reactive
       routing protocols in Low power and lossy network.  Routing
       requirements for various LLN deployments are studied in order to
       judge how reactive routing may or may not fit to those criteria.
       This document is intended to point out shortcomings of reactive
       protocols to operate in LLN.

  "Profile Support for the Atom Syndication Format", Erik Wilde,
  26-Apr-13, <draft-wilde-atom-profile-01.txt>

    The Atom syndication format is a generic XML format for representing
       collections.  Profiles are one way how Atom feeds can indicate that
       they support specific extensions.  To make this support visible on
       the media type level, this specification re-registers the Atom media
       type, and adds a "profile" media type parameter.  This allows
       profiles to become visible at the media type level, so that servers
       as well as clients can indicate support for specific Atom profiles in
       conversations, for example when communicating via HTTP.

  "Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance
  (DMARC)", Murray Kucherawy, 31-Mar-13,
  <draft-kucherawy-dmarc-base-00.txt>

    The email ecosystem currently lacks a cohesive mechanism through
       which email senders and receivers can make use of multiple
       authentication protocols in an attempt to establish reliable domain
       identifiers.  This lack of cohesion prevents receivers from providing
       domain-specific feedback to senders regarding the accuracy of
       authentication deployments.  Inaccurate authentication deployments
       preclude receivers from safely taking deterministic action against
       email that fails authentication checks.  Finally, email senders do
       not have the ability to publish policies specifying actions that
       should be taken against email that fails multiple authentication
       checks.
    
       This memo presents a proposal for a scalable mechanism by which an
       organization can express, using the Domain Name System, domain-level
       policies and preferences for message validation, disposition, and
       reporting with predictable and accurate results.
    
       The enclosed proposal is not intended to introduce mechanisms that
       provide elevated delivery privilege of authenticated email.  The
       proposal presents a mechanism for policy distribution that enables a
       continuum of increasingly strict handling of messages that fail
       multiple authentication checks, from no action, through silent
       reporting, up to message rejection.

  "Direct Random Access File Transfer", Diana Raft, 1-Apr-13,
  <draft-draft-draft-00.txt>

    Network file access is often highly inefficient due to complexity of
       existing protocols.  Direct Random Access File Transfer (DRAFT) is
       one new protocol that uses simple UDP techniques to overcome this
       problem.

  "Remote Laboratory Control Protocol", Evgeny Efimchick, 1-Apr-13,

  "Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation", Scott Burleigh, 1-Apr-13,
  <draft-irtf-burleigh-bibe-00.txt>

    This document describes Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation (BIBE), a
    Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol (BP) "convergence
    layer" protocol that tunnels BP "bundles" through encapsulating
    bundles.  The services provided by the BIBE convergence-layer
    protocol adapter encapsulate an outbound BP "bundle" in a BIBE
    convergence-layer protocol data unit for transmission as the payload
    of a bundle.  Security measures applied to the encapsulating bundle
    may augment those applied to the encapsulated bundle.

  "ICANN Registry Interfaces", Gustavo Lozano, 1-Apr-13,

       Escrow Agents upload the reports described in the Base Agreement of
       the new gTLD Applicant Guidebook.

  "Home Documents for HTTP Services: XML Syntax", Erik Wilde, 11-Jun-13,
  <draft-wilde-home-xml-01.txt>

    The current draft for HTTP Home Documents provides a JSON syntax
       only.  This draft provides an XML syntax for the same underlying data
       model, so that the concept of HTTP Home Documents can be consistently
       exposed in both JSON- and XML-based HTTP services.

       specification that computes a guaranteed node protection.

  "Proposed Refactoring of JOSE to Align Encryption and Key Wrapping",
  Richard Barnes, 5-May-13, <draft-barnes-jose-key-wrapping-01.txt>

    The discussions around key wrapping in the JOSE working group have
       raised new requirements for wrapped keys, namely: (1) Wrapping keys
       other than symmetric keys, (2) cryptographically binding attributes
       to keys, and (3) allowing the use of AEAD cryptographic algorithms
       for key wrapping (other than AES-KW).  This document proposes a
       refactoring of the JOSE document set that provides a cleaner
       conceptual structure for JWS / JWE and transparent support for
       wrapped keys, all with a relatively minor impact on the compact form
       of JWS and JWE objects.

  "HTTP Session Management", Phillip Hallam-Baker, 14-May-13,
  <draft-hallambaker-httpsession-01.txt,.pdf>

    The HTTP Session Management Mechanism provides a mean of securely
       establishing a persistent authentication session between a HTTP
       client and server that does not rely on the presentation of a
       confidential bearer token.  The Session Management Mechanism is
       intended to provide a replacement for the existing HTTP State
       Management Mechanism (Cookies) for this purpose.
    
       This document defines the HTTP Accept-Session, Set-Session and
       Session headers and specifies their use to establish symmetric
       authentication keys and their use to authenticate and verify specific
       parts of an HTTP message.  Other means by which keys used to
       authenticate the messages are established are outside the scope of
       this document.

  "ForCES Protocol Extensions", Jamal Hadi Salim, 3-Apr-13,
  <draft-jhs-forces-protoextenstion-00.txt>

    Experience in implementing and deploying ForCES architecture has
       demonstrated need for a few small extensions both to ease
       programmability and to improve wire efficiency of some transactions.
       This document describes a few extensions to the ForCES Protocol
       Specification [RFC5810] semantics to achieve that end goal.

  "Advertising MPLS labels in IS-IS", Hannes Gredler, Shane Amante, Tom
  Scholl, Luay Jalil, 21-May-13,
  <draft-gredler-isis-label-advertisement-03.txt>

    Historically MPLS label distribution was driven by protocols like
       LDP, RSVP and LBGP.  All of those protocols are session oriented.  In
       order to obtain a label binding for a given destination FEC from a
       given router one needs first to establish an LDP/RSVP/LBGP session
       with that router.
    
       Advertising MPLS labels in IGPs
       [I-D.gredler-rtgwg-igp-label-advertisement] describes several use
       cases where utilizing the flooding machinery of link-state protocols
       for MPLS label distribution allows to obtain the binding without
       requiring to establish an LDP/RSVP/LBGP session with that router.
    
       This document describes the protocol extension to distribute MPLS
       label bindings using the IS-IS protocol.

  "DHCPv6 Dynamic DNS Reconfiguration", Dan Wing, Tirumaleswar Reddy,
  Prashanth Patil, Mohamed Boucadair, 7-Jun-13,
  <draft-wing-dhc-dns-reconfigure-01.txt>

    Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, and
       IPV6-only hosts at the same time.  This makes prioritizing the DNS
       servers for hosts tricky due to a heterogeneous mix of protocol
       stacks causing optimal behavior to occur only when the host stack re-
       initializes.  The networks infrastructure is usually well equipped to
       be aware of single/dual-stack nature of hosts.  This specification
       extends DHCPv6 so that a DHCPv6 Relay Agent can dynamically influence
       the priority of DNS servers provided to the host, so that the host
       can use an optimal DNS server for resolution.

  "Design Recommendations for bfd to survive Planned Graceful restart",
  Palanivelan Appanasamy, 9-Apr-13, <draft-palanivelan-bfd-gr-rec-00.txt>

    Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (bfd) defined in RFC5880 is
       comprehensive and has sufficient mechanisms to overcome challenges in
       surviving Graceful Restart (Planned). However, implementations with
       architectural limitation were found to influence a BFD failure, in a
       process intensive environment.This memo outlines design options to
       overcome the challenges, within the existing bfd framework, in
       surviving planned GracefulRestart.

  "Terminology for Large MeAsurement Platforms (LMAP)", Philip Eardley, Al

  "Advertising MPLS labels in OSPF", Hannes Gredler, Shane Amante, Tom
  Scholl, Luay Jalil, 21-May-13,
  <draft-gredler-ospf-label-advertisement-03.txt>

    Historically MPLS label distribution was driven by protocols like

  "IANA Considerations and IETF Protocol and Documentation Usage for IEEE
  802 Parameters", Donald Eastlake, Joe Abley, 13-Jun-13,
  <draft-eastlake-rfc5342bis-04.txt>

    Some IETF protocols make use of Ethernet frame formats and IEEE 802
       parameters.  This document discusses some use of such parameters in
       IETF protocols, specifies IANA considerations for assignment of
       points under the IANA OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier), and
       provides some values for use in documentation. This document

    This document modifies the RSVP INTEGRITY object to support algorithm
       agility by explicitly indicating the algorithm used.  It also
       provides rationale for the design choices.  Finally, it updates the
       mandatory to implement algorithm.

  "Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Key Package Receipt and Error
  Content Types", Russ Housley, 22-Jun-13,
  <draft-housley-ct-keypackage-receipt-n-error-04.txt>

    This document defines the syntax for two Cryptographic Message Syntax
       (CMS) content types, one for key package receipts, and another for
       key package errors.  The key package receipt content type is used to
       confirm receipt of an identified key package or collection of key
       packages.  The key package error content type is used to indicate an
       error occurred during the processing of a key package.  CMS can be
       used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt these
       content types.

  "Algorithms for Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Key Package Receipt
  and Error Content Types", Sean Turner, 20-May-13,
  <draft-turner-ct-keypackage-receipt-n-error-algs-03.txt>

    This document describes the conventions for using several
       cryptographic algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
       key package receipt and error content types.  Specifically, it
       includes conventions necessary to implement SignedData,
       EnvelopedData, EncryptedData, and AuthEnvelopedData.

  "AES Encryption with HMAC-SHA2 for Kerberos 5", Kelley Burgin, Michael
  Peck, 19-Apr-13, <draft-kitten-aes-cts-hmac-sha2-00.txt>

    This document specifies two encryption types and two corresponding
       checksum types for Kerberos 5.  The new types use AES in CTS mode
       (CBC mode with ciphertext stealing) for confidentiality and HMAC with
       a SHA-2 hash for integrity.

  "Techniques for Tracking Inventory Using DHCPv6 DUID", Ted Lemon,
  21-Apr-13, <draft-lemon-dhc-inventory-01.txt>

    In the years since DHCPv4 gained widespread popularity, one of the
       uses to which organizations have put it is inventory tracking:
       associating identifiers scanned from packaging with records in an
       inventory database.  This document describes various means for
       accomplishing the same purpose using DHCPv6.  This document also
       updates RFC3315 by clarifying the meaning of some normative language
       regarding the DUID-LL and DUID-LLT DUID types.

  "A Group Text Chat Purpose for Conference and Service URIs in the

    This document defines and registers a value of "grouptextchat"
       ("Group Text Chat") value for the URI <purpose> element of SIP's
       Conference Event Package [RFC4575].

  "IMAP4 non-synchronizing literals", John Myers, Alexey Melnikov,
  23-Apr-13, <draft-melnikov-rfc2088bis-00.txt>

    The Internet Message Access Protocol (RFC 3501) contains the
       "literal" syntactic construct for communicating strings.  When
       sending a literal from client to server, IMAP requires the client to
       wait for the server to send a command continuation request between
       sending the octet count and the string data.  This document specifies
       an alternate form of literal which does not require this network
       round trip.

  "Problems with STUN Authentication for TURN", Tirumaleswar Reddy, Ram R,

       specified in iCalendar data.

  "TRILL Integrated Routing and Bridging Solution", Hao Weiguo, Li Yizhou,
  26-Apr-13, <draft-hao-trill-irb-00.txt>

    Currently, TRILL solution can only provide optimum unicast
       forwarding just for Layer2 traffic of intra-subnet forwarding, not
       for Layer3 traffic(inter-subnet forwarding). In this document, a
       TRILL Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) solution is introduced
       to provide optimum unicast forwarding not just for Layer 2 traffic
       (intra-subnet forwarding), but also for Layer 3 traffic (inter-
       subnet forwarding). In the TRILL IRB scenario, an edge RB MUST
       perform the bridging function for the End Systems that are on the
       same subnet and the IP routing for the End Systems that are on the
       different subnets of same tenant.

  "Implementation Experience of Identifier-Locator Network Protocol for

       evolutionary enhancement to IP to address multi-homing, mobility as
       well as other issues. This document provides experience of
       implementing ILNPv6 which is a specific engineering instance of ILNP
       based on IPv6. This document describes the problems arisen and our
       choices to solve the issues which may be helpful to others in
       implementing the protocol.

  "The application/firmware, application/firmware-receipt, and
  application/firmware-error media types", Sean Turner, Russ Housley,
  30-Apr-13, <draft-turner-application-firmware-media-types-00.txt>

    This document registers the application/firmware,
       application/firmware-receipt and application/firmware-error media
       media types for use with the corresponding CMS (Cryptographic Message
       Syntax) content types defined in RFC 4108.

  "OSPFv3 LSA Extendibility", Acee Lindem, Sina Mirtorabi, Abhay Roy, Fred
  Baker, 1-May-13, <draft-acee-ospfv3-lsa-extend-00.txt>

    OSPFv3 requires functional extension beyond what can be done with the
       fixed Link State Advertisement (LSA) format as described in RFC 5340.
       This document extends the LSA format by allowing the optional
       inclusion of Type-Length-Value (TLV) tuples in the LSAs.  It also
       covers all the aspects of backward compatibility.

  "RTP payload format for Enhanced Variable Rate Narrowband-Wideband plus

  <draft-agupta-payload-rtp-evrc-nw2k-00.txt>

    This document specifies real-time transport protocol (RTP) payload
       formats to be used for the Enhanced Variable Rate Narrowband-Wideband
       plus 2kbps Codec (EVRC-NW2K).  Three media type registrations are
       included for EVRC-NW2K RTP payload formats.  In addition, a file
       format is specified for transport of EVRC-NW2K speech data in storage
       mode applications such as e-mail.

  "A Procedure for Cautious Delegation of a DNS Name", Olaf Kolkman,
  Andrew Sullivan, 2-May-13, <draft-kolkman-cautious-delegation-00.txt>

    Sometimes, a DNS name is known to be in use in the wild even though
       it was never properly delegated.  This situation appears
       particularly, but not only, true in certain domains near the root of
       the tree: people have independently used those non-existent top-level
       domains as private namespaces.  If those names are to be delegated in
       the public DNS, prudence demands that collisions between the private
       uses and the public use be minimized.  At the same time, the public
       use should not be prohibited on the grounds of what is, after all,
       "hijacking" of a name space.  We outline a procedure to minimize harm
       while permitting delegation to proceed.

  "IPv6 Email Authentication", Douglas Otis, David Rand, 9-May-13,
  <draft-otis-ipv6-email-authent-01.txt>

    IPv6 facilitates network routing over an incredibly vast address
       space, but abuse mitigation resolving to underlying structures of
       routes or blocks of prefixes would be highly disruptive due to
       collateral effects.  Use of domains minimizes unintended coincidental
       blocking while offering the consolidation necessary to facilitate
       connection management.  Currently, email lacks conventions ensuring
       SMTP clients can be identified by an authenticated domain.
    
       DKIM is independent of intended recipients and domains accountable
       for having sent email.  SPF normally requires several text based
       responses imposing high overhead to query various locations.  These
       locations can be constructed by email-address local-part macros which
       can flood caches or leverage DNS name compression to further increase
       network DDoS amplifications when receivers' attempt to verify message
       sources which may then only offer authorization, not authentication
       of accountable domains.  Most email abuse, including what might be
       imposed by SPF, is prevented with comprehensive mapping of the
       address space, but such mapping is impractical with IPv6.
    
       An effective authenticated domain name alternative is needed to
       provide a basis for assessing and reacting to abusive behavior.  For
       most high scale protocols, this involves cryptography.

  "Router Advertisement based privacy extension in IPv6
  autoconfiguration",  Hosnieh, Christoph Meinel, 18-Jun-13,
  <draft-rafiee-6man-ra-privacy-04.txt>

    Privacy is an important issue which concerns many governments and
       users, with its importance becoming more evident every day. Nodes
       change their IP addresses frequently in order to avoid being tracked
       by attackers. The act of frequently changing IP addresses also helps
       to prevent the leakage of information by nodes. In IPv6 networks
       there is currently one solution for maintaining the privacy of nodes
       when IPv6 StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) (RFC 4862) is
       used. Unfortunately there are some problems associated with this
       solution which entails the use of the Privacy Extension (RFC 4941).
       One of the issues with this RFC concerns the wording that is used
       which allows the implementation to make the choice as to what
       approach to use and in so doing, in some cases, the choice made is
       not the most prudent or best approach and this is not ideal and can
       cause some problems. Some of these problems are concerned with not
       generating a new Interface ID (IID) after changing the router prefix.
       Another concern would be the fact that nodes may use an IID that was
       generated based on a MAC address as a public address, and then use
       this in their response. The act of cutting the current connections to
       other nodes, if the max lifetime of the old IID has elapsed, is also
       not clearly explained nor is whether or not the already used IID
       should be kept in stable storage, There is also a concern about the
       need to have stable storage available for the generation of a
       randomized IID. The RFC gives no explanation as to how to make use of
       CGA in its randomizing solution when stable storage is not available
       or how to use the same approach for random value generation in all
       implementations where there is a lack of stable storage. The purpose
       of this document is to address these issues, to update the current
       RFC and to introduce a new algorithm for the lifetime of IID.

  "Plan B: a proposal for signaling multiple media sources in WebRTC.",
  Justin Uberti, 2-May-13, <draft-uberti-rtcweb-plan-00.txt>

    This document explains how multiple media sources can be signaled in
       WebRTC using SDP, in a fashion that avoids many common problems and
       provides a simple control surface to the receiver.

  "HTTP Signatures", Mark Cavage, Manu Sporny, 4-May-13,
  <draft-cavage-http-signatures-00.txt>

    This document describes a way to add origin authentication, message
       integrity, and replay resistance to HTTP requests.  It is intended to
       be used over the HTTPS protocol.

  "Session Initiation Protocol Instance ID usage by the Open Mobile
  Alliance Push-to-talk over Cellular", Andrew Allen, 6-May-13,
  <draft-allen-dispatch-poc-instanceid-usage-00.txt>

    This document describes how SIP Instance ID as defined in RFC 5626
       [1] is used by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), for Push-to-talk over
       Cellular (PoC) and addresses security concerns with use of the SIP
       instance ID in non-register requests.

  "TRILL OAM MIB", Deepak Kumar, Samer Salam, Tissa Senevirathne,
  7-May-13, <draft-deepak-trill-oam-mib-00.txt>

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
       for use with network management protocols. In particular it defines
       the IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) OAM
       objects.

  "An Approach for Adding RTCWEB Media Streams without Glare", Adam Roach,
  7-May-13, <draft-roach-rtcweb-glareless-add-00.txt>

    One of the ongoing challenges in dealing with the massive number of
       streams that RTCWEB implementations may wish to instantiate and
       manipulate is the ability to add and remove streams in a way that
       avoids the condition known as "glare."  This document describes a
       non-normative set of behaviors that RTCWEB implementations can
       implement to completely avoid inducing a glare condition.

  "Using SDP with Large Numbers of Media Flows", Adam Roach, Martin
  Thomson, 7-May-13, <draft-roach-rtcweb-plan-a-00.txt>

    A recurrent theme in WebRTC has been the need to handle very large
       numbers of media flows.  Unfortunately, naive uses of SDP do not
       handle this case particularly well.  This document describes a modest
       set of extensions to SDP which allow it to cleanly handle arbitrary
       numbers of flows while still retaining a large degree of backward
       compatibility with existing and non-RTCWEB endpoints.

  "Supporting Authentication Trailer for OSPFv3", Manav Bhatia, Vishwas
  Manral, Acee Lindem, 23-Jun-13, <draft-acee-ospf-rfc6506bis-03.txt>

    Currently, OSPF for IPv6 (OSPFv3) uses IPsec as the only mechanism
       for authenticating protocol packets.  This behavior is different from
       authentication mechanisms present in other routing protocols (OSPFv2,
       Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS), RIP, and Routing
       Information Protocol Next Generation (RIPng)).  In some environments,
       it has been found that IPsec is difficult to configure and maintain
       and thus cannot be used.  This document defines an alternative
       mechanism to authenticate OSPFv3 protocol packets so that OSPFv3 does
       not only depend upon IPsec for authentication.  This document
       obsoletes RFC 6506.

  "Username Interoperability", Peter Saint-Andre, 8-May-13,
  <draft-saintandre-username-interop-00.txt>

    Various Internet protocols have defined constructs for usernames.
       This document describes a subset of characters to allow in usernames
       for maximal interoperability across Internet protocols.  The subset
       might prove useful in cases where a provider offers multiple services
       using the same underlying identifier.

  "Power Based Topologies in OSPF using LDP for label exchanges", Shankar
  Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Vasan Srini, 10-May-13,
  <draft-mjsraman-rtgwg-ospf-ldp-power-topo-00.txt>

    In this specification OSPF shortest path first computation is done
       based on power ratios (consumed-power to available-bandwidth OR
       available-bandwidth to available-bandwidth) assigned to links and
       nodes such as Broadcast-Multi-Access networks that form part of the
       topology in an area. When MPLS is deployed in the area (be it the
       backbone or non-backbone area) LDP can be used to distribute a
       disjoint set of labels for the power based topology. Flows some or
       all of those that traverse the area can then be mapped either to the
       regular shortest-path tree or the power based shortest-path tree.
       This document specifies the proposal to construct and maintain such a
       tree called the power based SPT.

  "The WebRTC Data Channel as a Transport for the Message Session Relay
  Protocol (MSRP)", Peter Dunkley, Gavin Llewellyn, 10-May-13,
  <draft-pd-msrp-webrtc-00.txt>

    The WebRTC Data Channel enables two-way real-time communication
       between browsers.  This document updates normatively updates RFC 4975
       to add support for WebRTC Data Channel as a transport for MSRP
       (Message Session Relay Protocol).  This will enable secure, low-
       latency, structured peer-to-peer messaging between WebRTC end-points.

  "Netconf surprises", Tom Petch, 10-May-13,
  <draft-petch-netconf-surprises-00.txt>

    This document identifies some aspects of Netconf that may come as a
       suprise to those familiar with the use of SNMP for device management.

  "Disable "Proxy ARP for Everything" on IPv4 link-local in the presence
  of IPv6 global address", Andrew Yourtchenko, Owen, 10-May-13,
  <draft-yourtchenko-ipv6-disable-ipv4-proxyarp-00.txt>

    rfc3927 defines the behavior "Proxy ARP for Everything" in case the
       only address present on the host is IPv4 link-local.  However, it
       does not specify anything about the presence or absence of IPv6
       global addressing.  This results in the hosts assuming it has both
       IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity in the scenario where the host itself is
       dualstack-enabled, but the network supplies only IPv6 configuration
       information.  Some implementations in this case may decide to use
       IPv4, which results in long connection delays.  This document
       proposes to avoid the "Proxy ARP for Everything" behavior if the host
       has been assigned an IPv6 address.

  "Address Autoconfiguration for RPL", Wan-Ting Zhu, 10-May-13,
  <draft-zhu-roll-addr-autoconf-00.txt>

    This document presents a straightforward address
           autoconfiguration mechanism for RPL over low power and lossy
           networks (LLN). A solution is proposed to add the capability
           of reusable address allocation. In this solution, nodes are
           assigned with unique IPv6 addresses according to their positions
           in the network. The amount of routing entries kept at each node
           is reduced. Also, this document introduces a dynamic adjustment
           strategy for adapting to uneven distribution of node density.

  "DKIM is Harmful as Specified", Douglas Otis, David Rand, 17-Jun-13,
  <draft-otis-dkim-harmful-03.txt>

    Currently, email lacks conventions ensuring SMTP clients can be
       identified by an authenticated domain.  Unfortunately many hope to
       use DKIM as an alternative, but it is independent of intended
       recipients and domains accountable for having sent the message.  This
       means DKIM is poorly suited at establishing abuse assessments of
       unsolicited commercial email otherwise known as SPAM, nor was this
       initially DKIM's intent.  DKIM lacks message context essential to
       ensure fair assessment and to ensure this assessment is not poisoned
       (Who initiated the transaction and to whom).
    
       DKIM was instead intended to establish increased levels of trust
       based upon valid DKIM signatures controlling acceptance and what a
       user sees within the FROM header field.  But DKIM failed to guard
       against pre-pended header fields where any acceptance based on valid
       DKIM signatures is sure to exclude header field spoofing, especially
       that of the FROM.  This weakness allows malefactors to exploit DKIM
       signature acceptance established by high-volume DKIM domains to spoof
       ANY other domain, even when prohibited within the Signer's network.

  "Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) Extensions for Websocket
  Allocations", Chen Xin, 13-May-13,
  <draft-chenxin-behave-turn-websocket-00.txt,.pdf>

    This document defines an extension to TURN that allows it to run over
       a Websocket [RFC6455] channel.  This will allow a client in a
       restrictive network to exchange and relay media or data over the
       websocket.

  "IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE Operation or Quick Flag Changes
  Resynchronization", Alexey Melnikov, 14-May-13,
  <draft-melnikov-rfc4551-bis-00.txt>

    Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate changes to
       a common IMAP mailbox.  Examples include different clients working on
       behalf of the same user, and multiple users accessing shared
       mailboxes.  These clients need a mechanism to synchronize state
       changes for messages within the mailbox.  They must be able to
       guarantee that only one client can change message state (e.g.,
       message flags) at any time.  An example of such an application is use
       of an IMAP mailbox as a message queue with multiple dequeueing
       clients.
    
       The Conditional Store facility provides a protected update mechanism
       for message state information that can detect and resolve conflicts
       between multiple writing mail clients.
    
       The Conditional Store facility also allows a client to quickly
       resynchronize mailbox flag changes.
    
       This document defines an extension to IMAP (RFC 3501).

  "BGP Extension for MVPN Site-Type Attribute", Pradeep Jain, Geetha
  RemaDevi, Jayant Kotalwar, Girish Birajdar, Jeffrey Zhang, 15-May-13,
  <draft-jain-mvpn-bgp-sitetype-attribute-00.txt>

    This document defines a new BGP attribute in BGP based multicast VPN,
       that allows a MVPN PE router to inform the rest of MVPN PE routers
       whether it is a sender site/receiver site and there by avoid all
       other PEs from setting up P-tunnels to the sender site PE.  This
       would reduce control plane states in the network and allow efficient
       network bandwidth utilization .

  "Last Autonomous System (AS) Reservations", Jeffrey Haas, Jon Mitchell,
  16-May-13, <draft-jhjm-idr-last-as-reservations-00.txt>

    This document reserves two Autonomous System numbers (ASNs) at the
       end of the 16 bit and 32 bit ranges, described in this document as
       "Last ASNs" and recommends they not be used by operators.

  "Web Conference Recording Use Case", Paul Kyzivat, Michael Yan,
  16-May-13, <draft-kyzivat-siprec-webconf-use-case-00.txt>

    The current work of SIPREC will soon finish.  As its charter defined,
       SIPREC has covered industries like financial trading floors, contact
       center and emergency service bureaus.  But when talking about
       products or solutions like data or web conferencing, SIPREC is
       insufficient to record all aspects of calls with different
       interactive media channels.  This draft tries to show a use case for
       web conference recording and show how it can work well under SIPREC
       mechanism.

  "Macros Nixed by Major Providers", Douglas Otis, David Rand, 28-May-13,
  <draft-otis-spfbis-macros-nixed-01.txt>

    SPF is a popular tool for managing email blocking issues.  It has
       also helped reduce backscatter related with Non-Delivery
       Notifications as was intended.  A practically unused feature is the
       SPF macro capability that SPFbis still in part retains.  This feature
       greatly diminishes SPF's utility and actually threatens email
       interchange, especially when used in conjunction with secondary
       policy layers when also ignored by major providers.  The macro
       mechanism is also unable to cope with internationalization, and is
       found in virtually none of the published resource records.  It is
       counter productive to retain the largely unused and often unsupported
       macro feature, despite efforts expended to develop the macro
       language.

  "JSON Service Connect (JCX) Protocol", Phillip Hallam-Baker, 13-Jun-13,
  <draft-hallambaker-wsconnect-02.txt,.pdf>

    JSON Service Connect (JCX) is a JSON/REST Web Service that may be
       used to establish and maintain a 'connection binding' of a device to
       an account held with a Web Service Provider.  Multiple connection
       bindings may be established under the same account to support
       multiple devices and/or multiple users of a single device.  A
       connection binding permits a device to securely connect to one or
       more services offered by the Web Service Provider with support for
       protocol and protocol version agilty and fault tollerance.
    
       The protocol is presented as a HTTP/JSON Web Service and uses the
       HTTP session continuation mechanism for authentication of transaction
       messages and supports negotiation of a HTTP session continuation
       mechanism context for the established endpoint connections.

  "SMTP security via opportunistic DANE TLS", Viktor Dukhovni, 18-May-13,
  <draft-dukhovni-smtp-opportunistic-tls-00.txt>

    This memo describes an experimental protocol for opportunistic TLS
       security based on the DANE TLSA PKI.  The design goal is an
       incremental transition of the Internet email backbone (MTA to MTA
       SMTP traffic) from today's unauthenticated and typically unencrypted
       connections to TLS encrypted and authenticated delivery when the
       client is DANE TLSA aware and the server domain publishes DANE TLSA
       records for its MX hosts.  This protocol has been implemented by
       author in the Postfix MTA.  It is hoped that other MTA
       implementations will find this protocol well suited to their needs
       and will adopt interoperable implementations.  This protocol may be
       suited to other use-cases for opportunistic TLS beyond SMTP, but such
       use-cases are not covered here, and will need to be defined in
       separate specifications.

  "DANE TLSA implementation and operational guidance", Viktor Dukhovni,
  19-May-13, <draft-dukhovni-dane-ops-00.txt>

    This memo discusses some operational aspects of publishing and using
       DANE TLSA records.  Server operators need to consider whether the
       intended clients are able to authenticate the server's certificate
       chain via the published TLSA records, some variations of TLSA records
       may not work as expected in all cases.  Clients need to decide which
       variations of TLSA records are sufficiently robust to be usable for
       server authentication.

  "A Common Operational Problem in DNS Servers - Failure To Respond.",
  Mark Andrews, 21-May-13, <draft-andrews-dns-no-response-issue-01.txt>

    The DNS is a query / response protocol.  Failure to respond to
       queries causes both immediate operational problems and long term
       problems with protocol development.
    
       This document will identify a number of common classes of queries
       that some servers fail to respond too.  This document will also
       suggest procedures for TLD and other similar zone operators to apply
       to reduce / eliminate the problem.

  "HTTP/2.0 Discussion: Extension Frame Types", James Snell, 20-May-13,
  <draft-snell-httpbis-ext-frames-00.txt>

    This memo describes the structure and use cases for a handful of
       "extension" frames types for HTTP 2.0.  The purpose of this document
       is to add to the overall discussion around the development of HTTP
       2.0 by describing ways in which the framing layer can be leveraged
       and extended.

  "Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)", Carsten Bormann, Paul
  Hoffman, 16-Jun-13, <draft-bormann-cbor-02.txt>

    The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format
       whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code
       size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need
       for version negotiation.  These design goals make it different from
       earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack.

  "GOST R 34.10-2012: Digital Signature Algorithm", Vasily Dolmatov,
  Alexey Degtyarev, 21-May-13, <draft-dolmatov-gost34102012-00.txt>

    This document is intended to be a source of information about the
    Russian Federal standard for digital signatures (GOST R 34.10-2012),
    which is one of the Russian cryptographic standard algorithms (called
    GOST algorithms).  Recently, Russian cryptography is being used in
    Internet applications, and this document has been created as
    information for developers and users of GOST R 34.10-2012 for digital
    signature generation and verification.

  "J-PAKE: Password Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling", Feng Hao,
  21-May-13, <draft-hao-jpake-00.txt>

    This document specifies a Password Authenticated Key Exchange by
       Juggling (J-PAKE) protocol.  This protocol allows the establishment
       of a secure end-to-end communication channel between two remote
       parties over an insecure network solely based on a shared password,
       without requiring a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or any trusted
       third party.

  "Schnorr Signature: Non-interactive Zero Knowledge Proof for Discrete
  Logarithm", Feng Hao, 21-May-13, <draft-hao-schnorr-00.txt>

    This document describes the Schnorr signature, a non-interactive
       variant of the three-pass Schnorr identification scheme.  The Schnorr
       signature allows one to prove the knowledge of a discrete logarithm
       without leaking its value.  It can serve as a useful building block
       for many cryptographic protocols to ensure the participants follow
       the protocol specification honestly.

  "The application/cms media type", Sean Turner, Russ Housley, Jim Schaad,
  21-Jun-13, <draft-turner-application-cms-media-type-05.txt>

    This document updates the definitions of IPv6 multicast scopes.

  "Recommended Usages of SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256", Tim Polk, Sean Turner,
  23-May-13, <draft-dang-turner-sha-512-224-256-00.txt>

    This document provides recommendations on the use of the secure hash
       functions SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 specified in FIPS 180. SHA-
       512/224 and SHA-512/256 are SHA-512-based and truncated to match the
       output size of SHA-224 and SHA-256. On 64-bit platforms, the SHA-512-
       truncated algorithms provide better performance than their comparably
       sized SHA-224 and SHA-256 variants.

  "Dynamic RP encodings in BGP based MVPNs", Pavan Kurapati, Marco
  Rodrigues, Kurt Windisch, Saud Asif, 23-May-13,
  <draft-kurapati-dynamicrp-bgpmvpn-00.txt>

    PIM Group-to-RP mappings are distributed dynamically using protocols
       such as BSR or Auto-RP.  The BGP-MVPN specification provides for this
       information to be encapsulated in an I-PMSI or S-PMSI provider tunnel
       between the PEs in an MVPN environment.  Since this is control
       information, it is desirable to signal this information in BGP
       between PEs, similar to carrying other customer control state such as
       C-Multicast routes.  This document specifies the mechanisms and
       procedures to carry bootstrap information via BGP to provide true
       control and data plane separation.

  <draft-schaad-trust-router-problem-01.txt>

    There are a number of problems with using the current AAA framework
       for doing access control, this document looks at a number of these
       issues and poses some questions about how to create a new trust
       router system.

  "NVGRE Router Alert Option", Kanwar Singh, Pradeep Jain, Florin Balus,
  Wim Henderickx, 24-May-13, <draft-singh-nvo3-nvgre-router-alert-00.txt>

    This proposal describes a new option to achieve a mechanism which
       alerts NVGRE egress End Point to more closely examine the contents of
       the packet encapsulated under NVGRE header.  This option is useful
       for case(s) where a given frame encapsulated within a given NVGRE
       segment responsible for carrying data between two different End
       Systems contains some control information (e.g OAM information) that
       may require special handling/processing at NVGRE egress End Point.

  "VxLAN Router Alert Option", Kanwar Singh, Pradeep Jain, Florin Balus,
  Wim Henderickx, 24-May-13, <draft-singh-nvo3-vxlan-router-alert-00.txt>

    This proposal describes a new option to achieve a mechanism which
       alerts VxLAN terminating VTEP to more closely examine the contents of
       the packet encapsulated under VxLAN header.  This option is useful
       for case(s) where a given frame encapsulated within a given VXLAN
       segment responsible for carrying data between two different End
       Systems contains some control information (e.g OAM information) that
       may require special handling/processing by terminating VTEP.

  "PCP Extension for Third Party Authorization", Dan Wing, Tirumaleswar
  Reddy, Prashanth Patil, Reinaldo Penno, 24-May-13,
  <draft-wing-pcp-third-party-authz-00.txt>

    It is often desirable for an application server to permit a flow
       across a firewall, as happens today when a firewall includes an
       Application Layer Gateway (ALG) function.  However, an ALG has
       several weaknesses.
    
       This document describes a cryptographic technique for an application
       server to permit a flow across a firewall.  This technique uses OAuth
       and a new PCP option.

  "Object Identifier Registry for the Long-Term Archive and Notary
  Services (LTANS) Working Group", Russ Housley, 25-May-13,
  <draft-housley-ltans-oids-00.txt>

    When the Long-Term Archive and Notary Services (LTANS) Working Group
       was chartered, an object identifier arc was set aside for use by that
       working group.  This document describes the object identifiers that
       were assigned, and it establishes IANA allocation policies for any
       future assignments within that arc.

  "The "property" and "context" Link Relations", Ioseb Dzmanashvili,
  26-May-13, <draft-property-and-context-link-relations-00.txt>

    RFC 5988 [RFC5988] defined the way of indicating resources on the
       Web. This specification defines link relation types that may be used
       to express the relationships between a resource and associated
       properties or between a resource and it's context.

  "P6R's Secure Shell Public Key Subsystem", Mark Joseph, Jim Susoy,
  23-Jun-13, <draft-joseph-pkix-p6rsshextension-03.txt>

    The Secure Shell Public Key Subsystem protocol defines a key distribution
       protocol to provision an SSH server with user's public keys.  However,
       that protocol is limited to provisioning an SSH server.   This document
       describes a new protocol that builds on the protocol defined in RFC 4819
       to allow the provisioning of keys and certificates to a server using the
       SSH transport.
    
       The new protocol allows the calling client to organize
       keys and certificates in different namespaces on a server.  These
       namespaces can be used by the server to allow a client to configure
       any application running on the server (e.g., SSH, KMIP, SNMP).
    
       The new protocol provides a server-independent mechanism for clients
       to add public keys, remove public keys, add certificates, remove
       certificates, and list the current set of keys and certificates known by
       the server by namespace (e.g., list all public keys in the SSH
       namespace).
    
       Rights to manage keys and certificates in a specific namespace are
       specific and limited to the authorized user and are defined as part of
       the server's implementation.   The described protocol is backward
       compatible to version 2 defined by RFC 4819.

  "Secure Origin Identification: Problem Statement, Requirements, and
  Roadmap", Jon Peterson, Henning Schulzrinne, Hannes Tschofenig,
  27-May-13, <draft-peterson-secure-origin-ps-00.txt>

    Over the past decade, SIP has become a major signaling protocol for
       voice communications, one which has replaced many traditional
       telephony deployments.  However, interworking SIP with the
       traditional telephone network has ultimately reduced the security of
       Caller ID systems.  Given the widespread interworking of SIP with the
       telephone network, the lack of effective standards for identifying
       the calling party in a SIP session has granted attackers new powers
       as they impersonate or obscure calling party numbers when
       orchestrating bulk commercial calling schemes, hacking voicemail
       boxes or even circumventing multi-factor authentication systems
       trusted by banks.  This document therefore examines the reasons why
       providing identity for telephone numbers on the Internet has proven
       so difficult, and shows how changes in the last decade may provide us
       with new strategies for attaching a secure identity to SIP sessions.

  "Update to the PCP specification", Stuart Cheshire, Simon Perreault,
  14-Jun-13, <draft-cheshire-pcp-unsupp-family-04.txt>

    The Port Control Protocol allows clients to request mappings in NAT
       gateways and firewalls.  This document specifies the PCP
       UNSUPP_FAMILY error code, which enables PCP servers to inform clients
       when the requested external address family is not supported.  This
       document also removes the requirement for the PCP server to validate
       the mapping nonce, which proved to be unhelpful in practice.

  "Using UDP Checksum Trailers in the Network Time Protocol (NTP)", Tal
  Mizrahi, 28-May-13, <draft-mizrahi-ntp-checksum-trailer-00.txt>

    The Network Time Protocol (NTP) allows clients to synchronize to a
       time server using timestamped protocol messages. To faciliate
       accurate timestamping, some implementations use hardware-based
       timestamping engines that integrate the accurate transmission time
       into every outgoing NTP packet during transmission. Since these
       packets are transported over UDP, the UDP checksum field is then
       updated to reflect this modification. This document proposes an
       extension field that includes a 2-octet Checksum Trailer, allowing
       timestamping engines to reflect the checksum modification in the last
       2 octets of the packet rather than in the UDP checksum field. The
       behavior defined in this document is interoperable with existing NTP
       implementations.

  "UDP Checksum Trailer in OWAMP and TWAMP", Tal Mizrahi, 28-May-13,
  <draft-mizrahi-owamp-twamp-checksum-trailer-00.txt>

    The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and the Two-Way
       Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) are used for performance
       monitoring in IP networks. Delay measurement is performed in these
       protocols by using timestamped test packets. Some implementations use
       hardware-based timestamping engines that integrate the accurate
       transmission timestamp into every outgoing OWAMP/TWAMP test packet
       during transmission.  Since these packets are transported over UDP,
       the UDP checksum field is then updated to reflect this modification.
       This document proposes to use the last 2 octets of every test packet
       as a Checksum Trailer, allowing timestamping engines to reflect the
       checksum modification in the last 2 octets rather than in the UDP
       checksum field. The behavior defined in this document is completely
       interoperable with existing OWAMP/TWAMP implementations.

  "A Fragmentation Strategy for Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)", Ron
  Bonica, Carlos Pignataro, 21-Jun-13,
  <draft-bonica-intarea-gre-mtu-02.txt>

    This memo documents a GRE fragmentation strategy that has been
       implemented by many vendors and deployed in many networks.  It was
       written so that a) implementors will be aware of best common practice
       and b) those who rely on GRE will understand how implementations
       work.  The scope of this memo is limited to point-to-point GRE
       tunnels.  All other tunnel types are beyond the scope of this memo.

  "Connectivity Provisioning Negotiation Protocol (CPNP)", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet, 29-May-13,
  <draft-boucadair-connectivity-provisioning-protocol-00.txt>

    This document specifies the Connectivity Provisioning Negotiation
       Protocol (CPNP) which is used to facilitate the dynamic negotiation
       of connectivity provisioning parameters between a Customer and a
       Provider.

  "No Plan: Economical Use of the Offer/Answer Model in WebRTC Sessions
  with Multiple Media Sources", Emil Ivov, Enrico Marocco, Peter Thatcher,
  17-Jun-13, <draft-ivov-rtcweb-noplan-01.txt>

    This document describes a model for the lightweight use of SDP Offer/
       Answer in WebRTC.  The goal is to minimize reliance on Offer/Answer
       exchanges in a WebRTC session and provide applications with the tools
       necessary to implement the signalling that they may need in a way
       that best fits their custom requirements and topologies.  This
       simplifies signalling of multiple media sources or providing RTP
       Synchronisation source (SSRC) identification in multi-party sessions.
       Another important goal of this model is to remove from clients
       topological constraints such as the requirement to know in advance
       all SSRC identifiers that they could potentially introduce in a
       particular session.
    
       The model described here is similar to the one employed by the data
       channel JavaScript APIs in WebRTC, where methods are supported on
       PeerConnection without being reflected in SDP.
    
       This document does not question the use of SDP and the Offer/Answer
       model or the value they have in terms of interoperability with legacy
       or other non-WebRTC devices.

  "Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP)", Jon Peterson, Cullen Jennings, Eric Rescorla, 29-May-13,
  <draft-jennings-dispatch-rfc4474bis-00.txt>

    The existing security mechanisms in the Session Initiation Protocol
       (SIP) are inadequate for cryptographically assuring the identity of
       the end users that originate SIP requests, especially in an
       interdomain context.  This document defines a mechanism for securely
       identifying originators of SIP messages.  It does so by defining two
       new SIP header fields, Identity, for conveying a signature used for
       validating the identity, and Identity-Info, for conveying a reference
       to the certificate of the signer.

  "IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option", Nalini
  Elkins, Michael Ackermann, Keven Haining, Sigfrido Perdomo, William
  Jouris, David Boyes, 30-May-13,
  <draft-elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-00.txt>

    To diagnose problems for a number of Enterprise Data Center Operators
       (EDCO), two metrics are critical for timely end-to-end problem
       resolution, both real-time and after the fact, without impacting an
       operational production network. They are: packet sequence number and
       packet timestamp. Packet sequence number is required for diagnostics.
       Packet timestamp is required to calculate end-to-end response time.
       Current methods are inadequate for these purposes because they assume
       unreasonable access to intermediate devices, are cost prohibitive,
       require infeasible changes to a running production network, and / or
       do not provide timely data. This document solves these problems with
       a new destination option, the Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
       destination option (PDM).

  "IANA Registries for BGP Extended Communities", Eric Rosen, Yakov
  Rekhter, 30-May-13, <draft-rosen-idr-extcomm-iana-00.txt>

    This document reorganizes the IANA Registries for the type values and
       sub-type values of BGP Extended Communities attribute and the BGP
       IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Communities attribute.  This is done
       in order to remove inter-dependencies among the registries, thus
       making it easier for IANA to determine which codepoints are available
       for assignment in which registries.  This document also clarifies the
       information that must be provided to IANA when requesting an
       allocation from one or more of these registries.  These changes are
       compatible with the existing allocations, and thus do not affect
       protocol implementations.  The changes will however impact the "IANA
       Considerations" sections of future protocol specifications.  This
       document updates RFCs 4360 and 5701.

  "Compression of IPsec AH and ESP Headers for Constrained Environments",
  Shahid Raza, Simon Duquennoy, Goran Selander, 31-May-13,
  <draft-raza-6lowpan-ipsec-00.txt,.ps,.pdf>

    This document describes the header compression mechanisms for the
       IPsec [RFC4301] based on the encoding scheme standardized in
       [RFC6282]. The IPsec Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulated
       Security Payload (ESP) headers are compressed using Next Header
       Compression (NHC) defined in [RFC6282]. This document does not
       invalidate any encoding schemes proposed in 6LoWPAN [RFC6282] but
       rather complements it with compressed IPsec using the free bits in
       the IPv6 Extension Header encoding.

  "Simple Host Discovery and Configuration Protocol", Dmitry Fedorov,
  1-Jun-13, <draft-d1f-shdcp-00.txt>

    The Simple Host Discovery and Configuration Protocol (SHDCP)
       provides a mechanism used when an Internet host with almost no
       configuration has to be discovered and, at the same time,
       configured to some IPv4 network.
       This task can not be accomplished by DHCP.
       Other known protocols are too complicated or proprietary.
       The key feature of the proposed protocol is simplicity.

  "Enhanced Route Refresh Implementation Report", Keyur Patel, Robert

    This document provides an implementation report for Enhanced Route
       refresh as defined in draft-ietf-idr-bgp-enhanced-route-refresh-03.
       The editor did not verify the accuracy of the information provided by
       respondents or by any alternative means.  The respondents are experts
       with the implementations they reported on, and their responses are

  "SA46T Prefix Resolution (SA46T-PR)", Naoki Matsuhira, 3-Jun-13,
  <draft-matsuhira-sa46t-pr-spec-00.txt>

    This document specifies SA46T Prefix Resolution (SA46T-PR)
       specification.  SA46T-PR is almost same as SA46T, however method of
       generation of outer IPv6 address is defferent.  SA46T is backbone
       network based approach, however SA46T-PR is stub network based
       approch.

  "SA46T Prefix Translator (SA46T-PT)", Naoki Matsuhira, 3-Jun-13,
  <draft-matsuhira-sa46t-pt-spec-00.txt>

    This document specifies SA46T Prefix Translator (SA46T-PT)
       specification.  SA46T-PT expand IPv4 network plane by connecting
       SA46T domain and SA46T-PR domain.  SA46T-PT translate prefix part of
       SA46T address and SA46T-PR address both are IPv6 address.  SA46T-PT
       does not translate IPv4 packet which is encapsulated, so transparency
       of IPv4 packet is not broken.

  "PIE: A Lightweight Control Scheme To Address the Bufferbloat Problem",
  Rong Pan, Preethi Natarajan, Chiara Piglione, Mythili Prabhu, 3-Jun-13,
  <draft-pan-aqm-pie-00.txt>

    Bufferbloat is a phenomenon where excess buffers in the network cause
       high latency and jitter. As more and more interactive applications
       (e.g. voice over IP, real time video streaming and financial
       transactions) run in the Internet, high latency and jitter degrade
       application performance. There is a pressing need to design
       intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and
       jitter; and hence provide desirable quality of service to users.
    
       We present here a lightweight design, PIE(Proportional Integral
       controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average
       queueing latency to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical
       analysis and Linux testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low
       latency and achieve high link utilization under various congestion
       situations. The design does not require per-packet timestamp, so it
       incurs very small overhead and is simple enough to implement in both
       hardware and software.

  "Secure Bootstrapping Solution for Resource-Constrained Devices", Behcet
  Sarikaya, 3-Jun-13, <draft-sarikaya-6lo-bootstrapping-solution-00.txt>

    We present a solution to initially configure the network of resource
       constrained nodes securely, a.k.a., secure bootstrapping.  The
       solution is based on EAP-TLS authentication with the use of raw
       public keys as certificates.

  Jeffrey Zhang, Yakov Rekhter, Andrew Dolganow, 3-Jun-13,
  <draft-zzhang-l3vpn-mvpn-bidir-ingress-replication-00.txt>

    RFC 6513 described a method to support bidirectional C-flow using
       "Partial Mesh of MP2MP P-Tunnels".  This document describes how
       partial mesh of MP2MP P-Tunnels can be simulated with Ingress
       Replication, instead of a real MP2MP tunnel.

  "Finding the Authoritative Registration Data (RDAP) Server", Marc
  Blanchet, 4-Jun-13, <draft-blanchet-weirds-bootstrap-00.txt>

    This document specifies a method to find which Registration Data

       a requested scope, such as domain names, IP addresses or Autonomous
       System numbers.

  "Definitions and Metrics for Data Center Benchmarking", Jacob Rapp,
  Lucien Avramov, 4-Jun-13, <draft-dcbench-def-00.txt>

    The purpose of this informational document is to establish
    definitions, discussion and measurement techniques for data center
    benchmarking. Also, it is to introduce new terminologies applicable
    to data center performance evaluations. The purpose of this document
    is not to define the test methodology, but rather establish the
    important concepts when one is interested in benchmarking network
    equipment in the data center.

  "PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH)", Matthew Miller, Peter Saint-Andre,
  4-Jun-13, <draft-miller-posh-00.txt>

    This document defines two methods that make it easier to deploy
       certificates for proper server identity checking in application
       protocols.  The first method enables a TLS client to obtain a TLS
       server's end-entity certificate over secure HTTP as an alternative to
       standard Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) and DNS-Based
       Authentication of Named Entities (DANE).  The second method enables a
       source domain to securely delegate an application to a derived domain
       using HTTPS redirects.

  "NSA's Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Key Management Attributes",
  Paul Timmel, Russ Housley, Sean Turner, 4-Jun-13,
  <draft-turner-km-attributes-00.txt>

    This document defines key management attributes used by the National
       Security Agency.  The attributes can appear in asymmetric and/or
       symmetric key packages as well as the Cryptographic Message Syntax
       (CMS) content types that subsequently envelope the key packages.

  "PIM-DM Optimizations for Large LANs", Joseph Weinstein, Joseph Keller,
  4-Jun-13, <draft-weinstein-bbn-pim-dm-large-lan-00.txt>

    Optimizations to the PIM-DM protocol [RFC3973] are proposed that
       dramatically reduce the PIM-DM routing overhead on local area
       networks containing large numbers of PIM routers.  These
       optimizations reduce the likelihood of two or more routers emitting
       redundant JOIN or PRUNE messages onto the same LAN.  While these
       optimizations are of general applicability to large LANs, they were
       motivated in particular by performance requirements for supporting
       PIM-DM across LANs emulated by IP tunneling over large wireless
       MANETs.
    
       PIM-DM routers supporting these optimizations will interoperate with
       standard PIM-DM as defined in RFC 3973, even on the same LAN.
       However, to obtain maximum benefit from these optimizations, all
       PIM-DM routers on the LAN SHOULD support them.

  "Generic UDP Encapsulation for IP Tunneling", Edward Crabbe, Lucy Yong,
  KuiKe Building, 4-Jun-13, <draft-yong-tsvwg-gre-in-udp-encap-00.txt>

    This document describes a method of encapsulating arbitrary protocols
       within UDP and GRE headers.  In this encapsulation, the source UDP
       port may be used as an entropy field for purposes of load balancing
       while the payload protocol may be identified by the GRE Protocol
       Type.

    This document specifies how a child zone in the DNS can publish a
       record that can indicate that a parental agent may copy and process
       certain records from the child zone.  The existence and change of the
       record may be monitored by a parental agent to either assist in
       transferring or automatically transfer data from the child to the
       parent.

  "Trust models of the Web PKI", Inigo Barreira, Bruce Morton, 5-Jun-13,

       PKI.  It describes the currently deployed Web PKI trust model and
       common variants.

  "Diameter Overload Control Solution Issues", Ben Campbell, 6-Jun-13,
  <draft-campbell-dime-overload-issues-00.txt>

    The Diameter Maintenance and Extensions (DIME) working group has
       undertaken an "overload control" work item, with the goal of
       standardizing a mechanism to allow Diameter nodes to report overload
       information among themselves.  Requirements currently include, among
       others, the need to accurately report the scope of overload
       conditions, and the ability to report overload information between
       nodes that are not directly connected at the transport layer.  These
       requirements introduce complex issues.  This document describes those
       issues, in the hope that it will assist the working group's decision
       process.

  "Side effect of DNSSEC: an increase of DS queries", Kazunori Fujiwara,
  6-Jun-13, <draft-fujiwara-dnsop-ds-query-increase-00.txt>

    A significant increase of periodic DS queries is observed at top
       level domain (TLD) DNS servers.  Currently, almost all of periodic DS
       queries come from DNSSEC validators and are queries for unsigned
       delegations.  The reason of the increase is low NCACHE TTL value and
       DS nonexistence.  This phenomena is DNSSEC protocol and DNS parameter
       issue.  DS queries will increase as DNSSEC validators will increase.

  "Interoperability Impacts of IPv6 Interworking with Existing IPv4 SIP
  Implementations", Carl Klatsky, Olle Johansson, Rifaat Shekh-Yusef,
  Andrew Hutton, Gonzalo Salgueiro, 6-Jun-13,
  <draft-klatsky-dispatch-ipv6-impact-ipv4-00.txt>

    This document captures potential impacts to IPv4 SIP implementations
       when interworking with IPv6 SIP implementations.  Although some
       amount of interworking translation will occur at the network and
       application layers, an IPv4 SIP application may still encounter a SIP
       message with some IPv6 values in it, resulting in unforeseen error
       conditions.  Such potential scenarios will be identified in this
       document so that SIP application developers can define solutions to
       handle these cases.  Note, this document is not intended to be an
       exhaustive list, rather to provide an overview of some of the more
       commonly encountered potential scenarios.

  Balus, Wim Henderickx, Vinay Bannai, 7-Jun-13,
  <draft-jain-nvo3-vxlan-ping-00.txt>

    This proposal describes a mechanism that can be used to detect Data
       Path Failures and sanity of VXLAN Control and Data Plane for a given
       VXLAN Segment.  This document defines the following:
    
       o  Information carried in a VXLAN "Echo Request", and
    
       o  "Echo Reply" for the purposes of fault detection and isolation,
          and mechanisms for reliably sending the Echo Request and reply.

  "Programmatic Interfaces to On-demand Network Services", Masum Hasan,
  Abdelhadi Chari, David Fahed, Monique Morrow, 7-Jun-13,
  <draft-masum-chari-i2rs-netservices-00.txt>

    One of the major features or requirements of Cloud is on-demand CRUD
       (Create / Read / Update / Delete) of Cloud resources or associated
       resources.  The on-demand feature dictates that resources are CRUD in
       a time-frame in the order of seconds or few minutes since the arrival
       of the resource CRUD request.  Many network resources cannot be CRUD
       in that time-frame.  With the support of programmable networking (or
       SDN) in the model of I2RS will facilitate programming of network
       resources rapidly, thus facilitating CRUD of Cloud or related network
       resources on-demand.  Network resources associated with many network
       services can be either a Cloud resource or directly associated with a
       Cloud resource.  These resources should be CRUD on-demand in Cloud
       timescale.  In this draft, employing Hybrid (virtual) Cloud as a use
       case and using I2RS as the "model", we will define few requirements
       for programmable on-demand interfaces to network services or I2NS.

  "Publishing organization boundaries in the DNS", John Levine, 9-Jun-13,
  <draft-levine-orgboundary-00.txt>

    Often, the organization that manages a subtree in the DNS is is
       different from the one that manages the tree above it.  Rather than
       describing a particular design, we describe an architecture to
       publish in the DNS the boundaries between organizations that can be
       adapted to various policy models.

  "CoAP High-Level State Option Extension", Richard Mietz, 9-Jun-13,
  <draft-mietz-core-coap-state-option-00.txt>

    CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained devices which
       are often equipped with sensors measuring a physical phenomenon such
       as temperature on a precise scale.  These sensor values are made
       available by a resource on the CoAP endpoint.  However, for many
       applications it is not necessary to have the full precision a sensor
       can provide.  It's often even enough to only have some high-level
       states instead of raw values.  This document presents a new option
       for CoAP to dynamically create new resources for a sensor which
       provides user-defined high-level states instead of raw sensor values.

  "HTTP Link Hints", Mark Nottingham, 9-Jun-13,
  <draft-nottingham-link-hint-00.txt>

  "Binary Encodings for JavaScript Object Notation: JSON-B, JSON-C,
  JSON-D", Phillip Hallam-Baker, 10-Jun-13,
  <draft-hallambaker-jsonbcd-00.txt,.pdf>

    Three binary encodings for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) are
       presented.  JSON-B (Binary) is a strict superset of the JSON encoding
       that permits efficient binary encoding of intrinsic JavaScript data
       types.  JSON-C (Compact) is a strict superset of JSON-B that supports
       compact representation of repeated data strings with short numeric
       codes.  JSON-D (Data) supports additional binary data types for
       integer and floating point representations for use in scientific
       applications where conversion between binary and decimal
       representations would cause a loss of precision.

  "Profiling of DTLS for CoAP-based IoT Applications", Sye Keoh, Sandeep
  Kumar, Zach Shelby, 12-Jun-13, <draft-keoh-dtls-profile-iot-00.txt>

    This document collects various implementation challenges of DTLS on
       embedded systems, and proposes a profile of DTLS for CoAP-based
       Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Specifically, this document
       investigates the application features and functionality of DTLS
       protocol, the fragmentation issue of DTLS Handshake protocol, and the
       complexity of the DTLS Handshake state machine. A RESTful DTLS
       Handshake which relies on CoAP Block-wise Transfer is proposed to
       address the fragmentation issue. The next step is to define a DTLS
       profile for embedded systems.

  "vCard S/MIME Capabilities Property", Alexey Melnikov, Sean Turner, Carl
  Wallace, 12-Jun-13, <draft-turner-vcard-smimecaps-00.txt>

    This document defines a vCard S/MIME Capabilities property and it
    defines or references values for many algorithms. The SMIME
    Capability values can also be included in S/MIME messages as a signed
    attribute and in public key certificates as an extension. The S/MIME
    Capabilities property is a complement to key property, which together
    enable usage of S/MIME without an initial exchange of email messages.

  "IEC 62351 Security Protocol support for GDOI", Brian Weis, Maik
  Seewald, Herb Falk, 12-Jun-13, <draft-weis-gdoi-iec62351-9-00.txt>

    The IEC 61850 power utility automation family of standards describe
       methods using Ethernet and IP for distributing control and data
       frames within and between substations.  The IEC 61850-90-5 and IEC
       62351-9 standards specify the use of the Group Domain of
       Interpretation (GDOI) protocol (RFC 6407) to distribute security
       transforms for some IEC 61850 security protocols.  This memo assigns
       updates GDOI to encode the security transforms and keying material

  "Network Service Chaining Problem Statement", Jim Guichard, Surendra,
  Paul Quinn, Michael Smith, Navindra Yadav, 13-Jun-13,
  <draft-quinn-nsc-problem-statement-00.txt>

    This document provides an overview of the issues associated with the
       deployment of network services (such as firewalls, load balancers) in
       large-scale environments.  The term service chaining is used to
       describe the deployment of such services, and the ability of a
       network operator to specify an ordered list of services that should
       be applied to a deterministic set of traffic flows.  Such service
       chains require integration of service policy alongside the deployment
       of applications, while maintaining optimal use of available network
       capacity and resources.

  "Network Service Header", Paul Quinn, Rex Fernando, Jim Guichard,

  "Differentiated Network-Located Function Chaining Framework", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet, 17-Jun-13,
  <draft-boucadair-network-function-chaining-00.txt>

    IP networks rely more and more on the combination of advanced
       functions (besides the basic routing and forwarding functions).  This
       document defines a solution to enforce Network-Located Function
       Chaining (NLFC) with minimum requirements on the underlying network.
       The proposed solution allows for Differentiated Forwarding
       (DiffForward): packets are classified at the entry point of an NLFC-
       enabled network, and are then forwarded on a per NLFC map basis.

  "A Trust Model for ABFAB Trust Routers", David Chadwick, 17-Jun-13,
  <draft-dwc-abfab-trust-model-00.txt>

    Trust routers form an integral part of the ABFAB infrastructure for
    determining routes between IdPs and RPs and determining CoI membership.
    Since it is inherent in their name that they are to be trusted, this
    Internet Draft specifies a trust model for their operation, so that IdPs
    and RPs can rely on them to perform the tasks that they are trusted to
    perform. These tasks are:
    
    -	form a trusted route between an IdP and RP
    -	ensure that a community of interest (CoI)only has the members that it
    should have

  "Multi-homed network in EVPN", Hao Weiguo, Li Yizhou, Pei Xu, 17-Jun-13,
  <draft-hao-l2vpn-evpn-mhn-00.txt>

    To enhance the reliability, bridged network is normally multi-homed
       to an EVPN network, there are two categories of mechanisms to avoid
       the layer 2 traffic loop. The first category does not require the PEs
       participating in the control protocol of the bridged network, while
       the second category requires that. [EVPN] described one of the first
       category mechanisms called  designated forwarder (DF) election to
       achieve loop avoidance and vlan-based load balancing. This draft
       mainly focuses on the second category of mechanisms which can achieve
       intra-vlan MAC-based load balancing. MAC-based VLAN balancing is more
       applicable than DF election mechanism if all end stations in bridged
       network are on the same VLAN which can cause traffic congestion in DF
       link.

  "CoAP Entities", Isam Ishaq, Jeroen Hoebeke, Floris Van den Abeele,

  "Interface Selection Mechanism for Multiple Interfaces IPv6 Hosts",
  Arnaud Kaiser, Alexandru Petrescu, 18-Jun-13,
  <draft-kaiser-if-sel-00.txt>

    This document describes an interface selection mechanism that enables
       multiple interfaces (multihomed) IPv6 hosts to select their most
       appropriate egress interface to send data over the network.  The
       mechanism extends the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol [RFC4861] with
       two new Router Advertisement options.

  "PCE-Initiated Traffic Engineering Path Setup in Segment Routed
  Networks", Siva Sivabalan, Clarence Filsfils, Jan Medved, Edward Crabbe,
  Robert Raszuk, 19-Jun-13, <draft-sivabalan-pce-segment-routing-00.txt>

    Segment Routing (SR) enables any head-end node to select any path
       without relying on a hop-by-hop signaling technique (e.g., LDP or
       RSVP-TE).  It depends only on "segments" that are advertised by Link-
       State Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs).  A Segment Routed Path can
       be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest
       Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration, or a stateful Path
       Computation Element (PCE).  This document specifies extensions to the
       Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to
       signal and instantiate Traffic Engineering paths in SR networks.

  Stephen Chasko, Subir Das, Rafael Lopez, Yoshihiro Ohba, Pascal Thubert,
  Alper Yegin, 23-Jun-13, <draft-ohba-6tsch-security-00.txt>

    Since 6TSCH forms layer 3 meshes over IPv6, PANA model matches the
       target architecture so PANA can apply for the process by a new device
       of joining the mesh to extend it.  This document details that
       particular operation within the whole 6TSCH architecture.

  "Certificate based keying scheme for DTLS secured IoT", Pawani
  Porambage, Pradeep Kumar, Andrei Gurtov, Mika Ylianttila, Erkki Harjula,
  23-Jun-13, <draft-pporamba-dtls-certkey-00.txt,.pdf>

    The IP-based Internet of Things (IoT) stands for the universal
       interconnection of smart objects and back end users with the help of
       IP protocols.  Secure key management among the smart objects is an
       important aspect of IoT security.  Due to the high levels of resource
       constraints of the devices in terms of memory, battery capacity and
       CPU power, and other network characteristics such as mobility,
       scalability, heterogeneity and limited bandwidth, the conventional
       security protocols cannot be directly deployed in IoT networks in
       their raw formats.  We propose a lightweight DTLS-based keying
       mechanism for CoAP IoT smart objects which supports the scalability
       of the network and node mobility.  The protocol consumes less device
       resources and minimum network bandwidth by incurring low message
       overhead.  The smart objects can securely access the network and
       obtain certificates after an initial configuration irrespective of
       the manufacturer standards.

  "Group Authentication", Judy Zhu, Minpeng Qi, Ye Tian, 23-Jun-13,
  <draft-zhu-core-groupauth-00.txt>

    The group communication is designed for the communication of Internet
       of Things. A threat is identified in [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm] that
       current DTLS based approach is unicast oriented and there is no
       supporting on group authentication feature. Unicast oriented
       authentication will causing serious burden when a large number of
       terminal nodes will be involved inevitably. In another aspect, some
       terminals will own the same characteristics, such as owning same
       features, in the same place, working in the same time, etc. With this
       mechanism, all terminals can be authenticated together with little
       signaling and calculation at the same time. It will reduce the
       network burden and save time. This draft describes the security of
       group authentication and an group authentication implementation
       method for the Internet of things.

Network Virtualization Overlays (nvo3)
--------------------------------------

  "Problem Statement: Overlays for Network Virtualization", Thomas Narten,
  Eric Gray, David Black, Luyuan Fang, Lawrence Kreeger, Maria Napierala,
  10-May-13, <draft-ietf-nvo3-overlay-problem-statement-03.txt>

    This document describes issues associated with providing multi-
       tenancy in large data center networks and how these issues may be
       addressed using an overlay-based network virtualization approach.  A
       key multi-tenancy requirement is traffic isolation, so that one
       tenant's traffic is not visible to any other tenant.  Another
       requirement is address space isolation, so that different tenants can
       use the same address space within different virtual networks.
       Traffic and address space isolation is achieved by assigning one or
       more virtual networks to each tenant, where traffic within a virtual
       network can only cross into another virtual network in a controlled
       fashion (e.g., via a configured router and/or a security gateway).
       Additional functionality is required to provision virtual networks,
       associating a virtual machine's network interface(s) with the
       appropriate virtual network, and maintaining that association as the
       virtual machine is activated, migrated and/or deactivated.  Use of an
       overlay-based approach enables scalable deployment on large network
       infrastructures.

  "Framework for DC Network Virtualization", Marc Lasserre, Florin Balus,
  Thomas Morin, Nabil Bitar, Yakov Rekhter, 4-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-nvo3-framework-02.txt>

    Several IETF drafts relate to the use of overlay networks to support
           large scale virtual data centers. This draft provides a framework
           for Network Virtualization over L3 (NVO3) and is intended to help
           plan a set of work items in order to provide a complete solution
           set. It defines a logical view of the main components with the
           intention of streamlining the terminology and focusing the solution
           set.

  "Network-related VM Mobility Issues", Yakov Rekhter, Wim Henderickx,
  Ravi Shekhar, Luyuan Fang, Linda Dunbar, Ali Sajassi, 10-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-nvo3-vm-mobility-issues-01.txt>

    This document describes a set of network-related issues presented by
       the desire to support seamless Virtual Machine mobility in the data
       center and between data centers. In particular, it looks at the
       implications of meeting the requirements for "seamless mobility".

  "Use Cases for DC Network Virtualization Overlays", Lucy Yong, Mehmet
  Toy, Aldrin Isaac, Vishwas Manral, Linda Dunbar, 1-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-nvo3-use-case-01.txt>

    This document describes the DC NVO3 use cases that may be
       potentially deployed in various data centers and apply to different
       applications. An application in a DC may be a combination of some
       use cases described here.

Web Authorization Protocol (oauth)
----------------------------------

  "SAML 2.0 Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization
  Grants", Brian Campbell, Chuck Mortimore, Michael Jones, 29-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-oauth-saml2-bearer-16.txt,.pdf>

    This specification defines the use of a SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion as
       a means for requesting an OAuth 2.0 access token as well as for use
       as a means of client authentication.

  "OAuth 2.0 Message Authentication Code (MAC) Tokens", Justin Richer,
  William Mills, Hannes Tschofenig, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac-03.txt>

    This specification describes how to use MAC Tokens in HTTP requests
       to access OAuth 2.0 protected resources.  An OAuth client willing to
       access a protected resource needs to demonstrate possession of a
       crytographic key by using it with a keyed message digest function to
       the request.
    
       The document also defines a key distribution protocol for obtaining a
       fresh session key.

  "Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and
  Authorization Grants", Brian Campbell, Chuck Mortimore, Michael Jones,
  Yaron Goland, 29-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-oauth-assertions-11.txt,.pdf>

    This specification provides a framework for the use of assertions
       with OAuth 2.0 in the form of a new client authentication mechanism
       and a new authorization grant type.  Mechanisms are specified for
       transporting assertions during interactions with a token endpoint, as
       well as general processing rules.
    
       The intent of this specification is to provide a common framework for
       OAuth 2.0 to interwork with other identity systems using assertions,
       and to provide alternative client authentication mechanisms.
    
       Note that this specification only defines abstract message flows and
       processing rules.  In order to be implementable, companion
       specifications are necessary to provide the corresponding concrete
       instantiations.

  "OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol", Justin Richer, John
  Bradley, Michael Jones, Maciej Machulak, 6-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-oauth-dyn-reg-12.txt>

    This specification defines an endpoint and protocol for dynamic
       registration of OAuth 2.0 Clients at an Authorization Server and
       methods for the dynamically registered client to manage its
       registration.

  "JSON Web Token (JWT)", Michael Jones, John Bradley, Nat Sakimura,
  28-May-13, <draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-08.txt,.pdf>

    JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact URL-safe means of representing
       claims to be transferred between two parties.  The claims in a JWT
       are encoded as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object that is
       used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the
       plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the
       claims to be digitally signed or MACed and/or encrypted.
    
       The suggested pronunciation of JWT is the same as the English word
       "jot".

  "JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and
  Authorization Grants", Michael Jones, Brian Campbell, Chuck Mortimore,
  29-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-bearer-05.txt,.pdf>

    This specification defines the use of a JSON Web Token (JWT) Bearer
       Token as a means for requesting an OAuth 2.0 access token as well as
       for use as a means of client authentication.

  "OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation", Torsten Lodderstedt, Stefanie Dronia,
  Marius Scurtescu, 16-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-oauth-revocation-10.txt>

    This document proposes an additional endpoint for OAuth authorization
       servers, which allows clients to notify the authorization server that
       a previously obtained refresh or access token is no longer needed.
       This allows the authorization server to cleanup security credentials.
       A revocation request will invalidate the actual token and, if
       applicable, other tokens based on the same authorization grant.

Operations and Management Area Working Group (opsawg)
-----------------------------------------------------

  "An Overview of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
  Mechanisms", Tal Mizrahi, Nurit Sprecher, Elisa Bellagamba, Yaacov
  Weingarten, 9-Jan-13, <draft-ietf-opsawg-oam-overview-08.txt>

    Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a general term
       that refers to a toolset that can be used for fault detection and
       isolation, and for performance measurement. OAM mechanisms have been
       defined for various layers in the protocol stack, and are used with a
       variety of protocols.
    
       This document presents an overview of the OAM mechanisms that have
       been defined and are currently being defined by the IETF.

  "Survey of Possibilities for the Automated Configuration of Large IP
  Networks", Tina Tsou, Juergen Schoenwaelder, Yang Shi, Tom Taylor,
  GuoLiang Yang, 23-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-opsawg-automated-network-configuration-05.txt>

    This memo discusses the steps required to bring a large number of
       devices into service in IP networks in an automated fashion.  The
       goal of this document is to list known solutions where they exist, to
       point out approaches proven to be problematic, and to identify gaps
       that require further specifications.

  "CGN Deployment with BGP/MPLS IP VPNs", Victor Kuarsingh, John
  Cianfarani, 18-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-opsawg-lsn-deployment-02.txt>

    This document specifies a framework to integrate a Network Address
       Translation layer into an operator's network to function as a Carrier
       Grade NAT (also known as CGN or Large Scale NAT).  The CGN
       infrastructure will often form a NAT444 environment as the subscriber
       home network will likely also maintain a subscriber side NAT
       function.  Exhaustion of the IPv4 address pool is a major driver
       compelling some operators to implement CGN.  Although operators may
       wish to deploy IPv6 to strategically overcome IPv4 exhaustion, near
       term needs may not be satisfied with an IPv6 deployment alone.  This
       document provides a practical integration model which allows the CGN
       platform to be integrated into the network meeting the connectivity
       needs of the subscriber while being mindful of not disrupting
       existing services and meeting the technical challenges that CGN
       brings.  The model included in this document utilizes BGP/MPLS IP
       VPNs which allow for virtual routing separation helping ease the CGNs
       impact on the network.  This document does not intend to defend the
       merits of CGN.

  "Ethernet in the First Mile Copper (EFMCu) Interfaces MIB", Edward
  Beili, 2-May-13, <draft-ietf-opsawg-rfc5066bis-02.txt>

    This document updates RFC 5066.  It amends that specification by
       informing the internet community about the transition of the EFM-CU-
       MIB module from the IETF Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB Working
       Group to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
       802.3 working group.

  "Hybrid-MAC Model for CAPWAP", Chunju Shao, Hui Deng, Farooq Bari, Rong
  Zhang, Satoru Matsushima, 8-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-opsawg-capwap-hybridmac-00.txt>

    The CAPWAP protocol supports two modes of operation: Split and Local
       MAC (medium access control), which has been described in
       [RFC5415].There are many functions in IEEE 802l.11 MAC layer that
       have not yet been clearly defined whether they belong to either the
       WTP (Wireless Termination Points) or the AC (Access Controller)in the
       Split and Local modes.  Because different vendors have their own
       definition of these two models, depending upon the vendor many MAC
       layer functions continue to be mapped differently to either the WTP
       or AC.  If there is no clear definition of split MAC and local MAC,
       then operators will not only need to perform vendor specific
       configurations in their network but will continue to experience
       difficulty in interoperating WTPs and ACs from different vendors.

  "Mechanisms for Optimal LAG/ECMP Component Link Utilization in
  Networks", ramki, Sanjay Khanna, Lucy Yong, Anoop Ghanwani, So Ning,
  Bhumip Khasnabish, 23-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-opsawg-large-flow-load-balancing-01.txt>

    Demands on networking infrastructure are growing exponentially; the
       drivers are bandwidth hungry rich media applications, inter-data
       center communications, etc. In this context, it is important to
       optimally use the bandwidth in wired networks that extensively use
       LAG/ECMP techniques for bandwidth scaling. This draft explores some
       of the mechanisms useful for achieving this.

  "CAPWAP Extension for 802.11n and Power/channel Reconfiguration", Yifan
  Chen, Dapeng Liu, Hui Deng, Lei Zhu, 9-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-opsawg-capwap-extension-00.txt>

    CAPWAP binding for 802.11 is specified by RFC5416 and it was based on
       IEEE 802-11.2007 standard.  After RFC5416 was published in 2009,
       there was several new amendent of 802.11 has been published.  802.11n
       is one of those amendent and it has been widely used in real
       deployment.  This document extends the CAPWAP binding for 802.11 to
       support 802.11n.

Operational Security Capabilities for IP Network Infrastructure (opsec)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  "Security Best Practices Efforts and Documents", Chris Lonvick, David
  Spak, 13-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-opsec-efforts-20.txt>

    This document provides a snapshot of the current efforts to define or
       apply security requirements in various Standards Developing
       Organizations (SDO).

  "Recommendations on filtering of IPv4 packets containing IPv4 options",
  Fernando Gont, R. Atkinson, Carlos Pignataro, 26-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-opsec-ip-options-filtering-02.txt>

    This document document provides advice on the filtering of IPv4
       packets based on the IPv4 options they contain.  Additionally, it
       discusses the operational and interoperability implications of
       dropping packets based on the IP options they contain.

  "Using Only Link-Local Addressing Inside an IPv6 Network", Michael
  Behringer, Eric Vyncke, 15-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-opsec-lla-only-03.txt>

    In an IPv6 network it is possible to use only link-local addresses on
       infrastructure links between routers.  This document discusses the
       advantages and disadvantages of this approach to help the decision
       process for a given network.

  "Security Implications of IPv6 on IPv4 Networks", Fernando Gont, Will
  Liu, 2-May-13, <draft-ietf-opsec-ipv6-implications-on-ipv4-nets-04.txt>

    This document discusses the security implications of native IPv6
       support and IPv6 transition/co-existence technologies on "IPv4-only"
       networks, and describes possible mitigations for the aforementioned
       issues.

  "Operational Security Considerations for IPv6 Networks", KK
  Chittimaneni, Merike Kaeo, Eric Vyncke, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-opsec-v6-02.txt>

    Knowledge and experience on how to operate IPv4 securely is
       available: whether it is the Internet or an enterprise internal
       network.  However, IPv6 presents some new security challenges.  RFC
       4942 describes the security issues in the protocol but network
       managers also need a more practical, operations-minded best common
       practices.
    
       This document analyzes the operational security issues in all places
       of a network (service providers, enterprises and residential users)
       and proposes technical and procedural mitigations techniques.

  "Network Reconnaissance in IPv6 Networks", Fernando Gont, Tim Chown,
  30-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-opsec-ipv6-host-scanning-01.txt>

    IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4
       counterpart.  The standard /64 IPv6 subnets can (in theory)
       accommodate approximately 1.844 * 10^19 hosts, thus resulting in a
       much lower host density (#hosts/#addresses) than their IPv4
       counterparts.  As a result, it is widely assumed that it would take a
       tremendous effort to perform address scanning attacks against IPv6
       networks, and therefore IPv6 address scanning attacks have long been
       considered unfeasible.  This document analyzes how traditional
       address scanning techniques apply to IPv6 networks, and also explores
       a number of other techniques that can be employed for IPv6 network
       reconnaissance.  Additionally, this document formally obsoletes RFC
       5157.

  "BGP operations and security", Jerome Durand, Ivan Pepelnjak, Gert
  Doering, 18-Jan-13, <draft-ietf-opsec-bgp-security-00.txt>

    BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the protocol almost exclusively used
       in the Internet to exchange routing information between network
       domains.  Due to this central nature, it's important to understand
       the security measures that can and should be deployed to prevent
       accidental or intentional routing disturbances.
    
       This document describes measures to protect the BGP sessions itself
       (like TTL, MD5, control plane filtering) and to better control the
       flow of routing information, using prefix filtering and
       automatization of prefix filters, max-prefix filtering, AS path
       filtering, route flap dampening and BGP community scrubbing.

Open Shortest Path First IGP (ospf)
-----------------------------------

  "OSPF Transport Instance Extensions", Acee Lindem, Abhay Roy, Sina
  Mirtorabi, 5-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-ospf-transport-instance-10.txt>

    OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 include a reliable flooding mechanism to
       disseminate routing topology and Traffic Engineering (TE) information
       within a routing domain.  Given the effectiveness of these
       mechanisms, it is convenient to envision using the same mechanism for
       dissemination of other types of information within the domain.
       However, burdening OSPF with this additional information will impact
       intra-domain routing convergence and possibly jeopardize the
       stability of the OSPF routing domain.  This document presents
       mechanism to relegate this ancillary information to a separate OSPF
       instance and minimize the impact.

  "Routing for IPv4-embedded IPv6 Packets", Dean Cheng, Mohamed Boucadair,
  Alvaro Retana, 10-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-ipv4-embedded-ipv6-routing-14.txt>

    This document describes a routing scenario where IPv4 packets are
       transported over an IPv6 network, based on RFCs 6145 and 6052, along
       with a separate OSPFv3 routing table for IPv4-embedded IPv6 routes in
       the IPv6 network.

  "Security Extension for OSPFv2 when using Manual Key Management", Manav
  Bhatia, Sam Hartman, Dacheng Zhang, Acee Lindem, 27-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-security-extension-manual-keying-05.txt>

    The current OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication mechanism as defined
       in the OSPF standards is vulnerable to both inter-session and intra-
       session replay attacks when its uses manual keying.  Additionally,
       the existing cryptographic authentication schemes do not cover the IP
       header.  This omission can be exploited to carry out various types of
       attacks.
    
       This draft proposes changes to the authentication sequence number
       mechanism that will protect OSPFv2 from both inter-session and intra-
       session replay attacks when its using manual keys for securing its
       protocol packets.  Additionally, we also describe some changes in the
       cryptographic hash computation so that we eliminate most attacks that
       result because OSPFv2 does not protect the IP header.

  "OSPF Stub Router Advertisement", Alvaro Retana, Liem Nguyen, Alex
  Zinin, Russ White, Danny McPherson, 23-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-rfc3137bis-04.txt>

    This document describes a backward-compatible technique that may be
       used by OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) implementations to advertise
       a router's unavailability to forward transit traffic, or to lower the
       preference level for the paths through such a router.
    
       This document obsoletes [RFC3137].

  "Use of OSPF-MDR in Single-Hop Broadcast Networks", Richard Ogier,
  3-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-ospf-manet-single-hop-mdr-03.txt>

    RFC 5614 (OSPF-MDR) extends OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks
    (MANETs) by specifying its operation on the new OSPF interface of type
    MANET.  This document describes the use of OSPF-MDR in a single-hop
    broadcast network, which is a special case of a MANET in which each
    router is a (one-hop) neighbor of each other router.  Unlike an OSPF
    broadcast interface, such an interface can have a different cost
    associated with each neighbor.  The document includes configuration
    recommendations and simplified mechanisms that can be used in single-hop
    broadcast networks.

  "OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions", Spencer Giacalone,
  David Ward, John Drake, Alia Atlas, Stefano Previdi, 3-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-te-metric-extensions-04.txt,.pdf>

    In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
       information networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network
       performance criteria (e.g. latency) are becoming as critical to data
       path selection as other metrics.
    
       This document describes extensions to OSPF TE [RFC3630] such that
       network performance information can be distributed and collected in a
       scalable fashion. The information distributed using OSPF TE Metric
       Extensions can then be used to make path selection decisions based on
       network performance.
    
       Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which network
       performance information is distributed. The mechanisms for measuring
       network performance or acting on that information, once distributed,
       are outside the scope of this document.

  "Use of the OSPF-MANET Interface in Single-Hop Broadcast Networks",
  Alvaro Retana, Stan Ratliff, 13-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-manet-single-hop-or-02.txt>

    This document describes the use of the OSPF-MANET interface in
       single-hop broadcast networks.  It includes a mechanism to
       dynamically determine the presence of such a network and specific
       operational considerations due to its nature.
    
       This document updates [RFC5820].

  "OSPFv3 Instance ID Registry Update", Alvaro Retana, Dean Cheng,
  26-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-ospf-ospfv3-iid-registry-update-04.txt>

    This document modifies the "Unassigned" number space in the IANA
       "OSPFv3 Instance ID Address Family Values" registry by dividing it in
       two halves, one half Unassigned but managed via Standards Action, and
       the other Reserved for Private Use.  It updates [RFC5838].

  "OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration", Acee Lindem, Jari Arkko, 15-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig-02.txt>

    OSPFv3 is a candidate for deployments in environments where auto-
       configuration is a requirement.  One such environment is the IPv6
       home network where users expect to simply plug in a router and have
       it automatically use OSPFv3 for intra-domain routing.  This document
       describes the necessary mechanisms for OSPFv3 to be self-configuring.

Peer-to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (p2psip)
-------------------------------------------------

  "REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol", Cullen
  Jennings, Bruce Lowekamp, Eric Rescorla, Salman Baset, Henning
  Schulzrinne, 24-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-p2psip-base-26.txt>

    This specification defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD),
       a peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet.  A
       P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage
       and messaging service between a set of cooperating peers that form
       the overlay network.  RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session
       Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other
       applications with similar requirements by defining new usages that
       specify the kinds of data that needs to be stored for a particular
       application.  RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificate
       enrollment service that provides unique identities.  NAT traversal is
       a fundamental service of the protocol.  RELOAD also allows access
       from "client" nodes that do not need to route traffic or store data
       for others.

  "A SIP Usage for RELOAD", Cullen Jennings, Bruce Lowekamp, Eric
  Rescorla, Salman Baset, Henning Schulzrinne, Thomas Schmidt, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-sip-09.txt>

    This document defines a SIP Usage for REsource LOcation And Discovery
       (RELOAD).  The SIP Usage provides the functionality of a SIP proxy or
       registrar in a fully-distributed system and includes a lookup service
       for Address of Records (AORs) stored in the overlay.  It also defines
       Globally Routable User Agent Uris (GRUUs) that allow the
       registrations to map an AOR to a specific node reachable through the
       overlay.  After such initial contact of a peer, the AppAttach method
       is used to establish a direct connection between nodes through which
       SIP messages are exchanged.

  "P2P Overlay Diagnostics", Haibin Song, XingFeng Jiang, Roni Even, David
  Bryan, 24-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-p2psip-diagnostics-11.txt>

    This document describes mechanisms for P2P overlay diagnostics.  It
       defines extensions to the RELOAD P2PSIP base protocol RELOAD
       [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] to collect diagnostic information, and details
       the protocol specifications for these extensions.  Useful diagnostic
       information for connection and node status monitoring is also
       defined.  The document also describes the usage scenarios and
       provides examples of how these methods are used to perform
       diagnostics in a P2PSIP overlay networks.

  "A Self-tuning Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for REsource LOcation And
  Discovery (RELOAD)", Jouni Maenpaa, Gonzalo Camarillo, 16-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-self-tuning-08.txt>

    REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) is a peer-to-peer (P2P)
       signaling protocol that provides an overlay network service.  Peers
       in a RELOAD overlay network collectively run an overlay algorithm to
       organize the overlay, and to store and retrieve data.  This document
       describes how the default topology plugin of RELOAD can be extended
       to support self-tuning, that is, to adapt to changing operating
       conditions such as churn and network size.

  "Service Discovery Usage for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD)",
  Jouni Maenpaa, Gonzalo Camarillo, 23-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-service-discovery-08.txt>

    REsource LOcation and Discovery (RELOAD) does not define a generic
       service discovery mechanism as a part of the base protocol.  This
       document defines how the Recursive Distributed Rendezvous (ReDiR)
       service discovery mechanism used in OpenDHT can be applied to RELOAD
       overlays to provide a generic service discovery mechanism.

  "An extension to RELOAD to support Direct Response Routing", Ning Zong,
  XingFeng Jiang, Roni Even, Yunfei Zhang, 9-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-drr-07.txt>

    This document proposes an optional extension to RELOAD to support
       direct response routing mode.  RELOAD recommends symmetric recursive
       routing for routing messages.  The new optional extension provides a
       shorter route for responses reducing the overhead on intermediate
       peers and describes the potential cases where this extension can be
       used.

  "An extension to RELOAD to support Relay Peer Routing", Ning Zong,
  XingFeng Jiang, Roni Even, Yunfei Zhang, 9-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-rpr-07.txt>

    This document proposes an optional extension to RELOAD to support
       relay peer routing mode.  RELOAD recommends symmetric recursive
       routing for routing messages.  The new optional extension provides a
       shorter route for responses reducing the overhead on intermediate
       peers and describes the potential use cases where this extension can
       be used.

  "A Usage for Shared Resources in RELOAD (ShaRe)", Alexander Knauf,
  Thomas Schmidt, Gabriel Hege, Matthias Waehlisch, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-share-01.txt>

    This document defines a RELOAD Usage for managing shared write access
       to RELOAD Resources.  Shared Resources in RELOAD (ShaRe) form a basic
       primitive for enabling various coordination and notification schemes
       among distributed peers.  Access in ShaRe is controlled by a
       hierarchical trust delegation scheme maintained within an access
       list.  A new USER-CHAIN-ACL access policy allows authorized peers to
       write a Shared Resource without owning its corresponding certificate.
       This specification also adds mechanisms to store Resources with a
       variable name which is useful whenever peer-independent rendezvous
       processes are required.

  "Configuration of Access Control Policy in REsource LOcation And
  Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol", Marc Petit-Huguenin, 16-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-access-control-00.txt>

    This document describes an extension to the REsource LOcation And
       Discovery (RELOAD) base protocol to distribute the code of new Access
       Control Policies without having to upgrade the RELOAD implementations
       in an overlay.

Protocol to Access WS database (paws)
-------------------------------------

  "Protocol to Access Spectrum Database", Vincent Chen, Subir Das, Lei
  Zhu, John Malyar, Pete McCann, 19-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-paws-protocol-06.txt>

    Portions of the radio spectrum that are allocated to licensees are
       available for non-interfering use.  This available spectrum is called
       "White Space."  Allowing secondary users access to available spectrum
       "unlocks" existing spectrum to maximize its utilization and to
       provide opportunities for innovation, resulting in greater overall
       spectrum utilization.
    
       One approach to manage spectrum sharing uses databases to report
       spectrum availability to devices.  To achieve interoperability among
       multiple devices and databases, a standardized protocol must be
       defined and implemented.  This document defines such a protocol, the
       "Protocol to Access White Space database" (PAWS).

Audio/Video Transport Payloads (payload)
----------------------------------------

  "RTP Payload Format for the iSAC Codec", Tina le Grand, Paul Jones,

    This document specifies a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload
       format to be used for the low complexity subband codec (SBC), which
       is the mandatory audio codec of the Advanced Audio Distribution
       Profile (A2DP) Specification written by the Bluetooth(r) Special
       Interest Group (SIG). The payload format is designed to be able to
       interoperate with existing Bluetooth A2DP devices, to provide high
       streaming audio quality, interactive audio transmission over the
       internet, and ultra-low delay coding for jam sessions on the
       internet. This document contains also a media type registration
       which specifies the use of the RTP payload format.

  "RTP Payload Format for Opus Speech and Audio Codec", Julian Spittka,
  Koen Vos, Jean-Marc Valin, 10-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-payload-rtp-opus-00.txt>

    This document defines the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload
       format for packetization of Opus encoded speech and audio data that
       is essential to integrate the codec in the most compatible way.
       Further, media type registrations are described for the RTP payload
       format.

  "RTP Payload Format for Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X Codecs", John
  Lindsay, Hartmut Foerster, 13-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-payload-rtp-aptx-00.txt,.pdf>

    This document specifies a scheme for packetizing Standard apt-X, or
       Enhanced apt-X, encoded audio data into Real-time Transport Protocol
       (RTP) packets.  The document describes a payload format that permits
       transmission of multiple related audio channels in a single RTP
       payload, and a means of establishing Standard apt-X and Enhanced
       apt-X connections through the Session Description Protocol (SDP).

       G.711.0 RTP payload format.

Path Computation Element (pce)
------------------------------

  "Requirements for GMPLS applications of PCE", Tomohiro Otani, Kenichi
  Ogaki, Diego Caviglia, Fatai Zhang, Cyril Margaria, 10-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req-08.txt>

    The initial effort of the PCE (Path computation element) WG is
       specifically focused on MPLS.  As a next step, this draft describes
       functional requirements for GMPLS application of PCE.

  "PCE communication protocol (PCEP) Management Information Base", Kiran
  Koushik, Emile Stephan, Quintin Zhao, Daniel King, Jonathan Hardwick,
  19-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-pce-pcep-mib-04.txt>

    This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
       Information Base for use with network management protocols in the
       Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects for
       modeling of Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP)
       for communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path
       Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs.

  "Conveying Vendor-Specific Constraints in the Path Computation Element
  Protocol", Fatai Zhang, Adrian Farrel, 22-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-pce-vendor-constraints-10.txt>

    The Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) is used to convey path
       computation requests and responses between Path Computation Clients
       (PCCs) and Path Computation Elements (PCEs), and also between
       cooperating PCEs.  In PCEP the path computation requests carry
       details of the constraints and objective functions that the PCC
       wishes the PCE to apply in its computation.
    
       This document defines a facility to carry vendor-specific information
       in PCEP using a dedicated object and a new Type-Length-Variable that
       can be carried in any existing PCEP object.

  "Applicability of the Path Computation Element to Inter-Area and
  Inter-AS MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering", Daniel King, Julien
  Meuric, Olivier Dugeon, Quintin Zhao, Oscar de Dios, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-pce-inter-area-as-applicability-03.txt>

    The Path Computation Element (PCE) may be used for computing services
       that traverse multi-area and multi-AS Multiprotocol Label Switching
       (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered (TE) networks.
    
       This document examines the applicability of the PCE architecture,
       protocols, and protocol extensions for computing multi-area and
       multi-AS paths in MPLS and GMPLS networks.

  "PCE-based Computation Procedure To Compute Shortest Constrained P2MP
  Inter-domain Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths", Quintin Zhao,
  Dhruv Dhody, Zafar Ali, Daniel King, Ramon Casellas, 15-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-pce-pcep-inter-domain-p2mp-procedures-04.txt>

    The ability to compute paths for constrained point-to-multipoint
       (P2MP) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) across
       multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement for the
       deployment of P2MP services in MPLS and GMPLS networks.  The Path
       Computation Element (PCE) has been recognized as an appropriate
       technology for the determination of inter-domain paths of P2MP TE
       LSPs.
    
       This document describes an experiment to provide procedures and
       extensions to the PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) for the
       computation of inter-domain paths for P2MP TE LSPs.

  "PCEP Extensions for Stateful PCE", Edward Crabbe, Jan Medved, Ina
  Minei, Robert Varga, 10-May-13, <draft-ietf-pce-stateful-pce-04.txt>

    The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
       mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
       computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
    
       Although PCEP explicitly makes no assumptions regarding the
       information available to the PCE, it also makes no provisions for
       synchronization or PCE control of timing and sequence of path
       computations within and across PCEP sessions.  This document
       describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of
       MPLS-TE and GMPLS LSPs via PCEP.

  "Standard Representation Of Domain-Sequence", Dhruv Dhody, Udayasree
  Palle, Ramon Casellas, 18-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-pce-pcep-domain-sequence-02.txt>

    The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label
       Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
       Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been
       identified as a key requirement for P2P and P2MP scenarios.  In this
       context, a domain is a collection of network elements within a common
       sphere of address management or path computational responsibility
       such as an IGP area or an Autonomous Systems.  This document
       specifies a standard representation and encoding of a Domain-
       Sequence, which is defined as an ordered sequence of domains
       traversed to reach the destination domain.  This document also
       defines new subobjects to be used to encode domain identifiers.

  "Extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
  (PCEP) to compute service aware Label Switched Path (LSP).", Dhruv
  Dhody, Vishwas Manral, Zafar Ali, George Swallow, Kenji Kumaki,
  26-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-pce-pcep-service-aware-00.txt>

    In certain networks like financial information network (stock/
       commodity trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications,
       Latency (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet loss is
       becoming a key requirement for path computation along with other
       constraints and metrics.  Latency, Latency-Variation and Packet Loss
       is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between
       customers and service providers.
    
       [MPLS-DELAY-FWK] describes MPLS architecture to allow Latency
       (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet loss as properties.
       [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS] describes mechanisms with
       which network performance information is distributed via OSPF and
       ISIS respectively.  This document describes the extension to PCEP to
       carry Latency, Latency-Variation and Loss as constraints for end to
       end path computation.

  "PCEP Extension for WSON Routing and Wavelength Assignment", Young Lee,
  Ramon Casellas, 2-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-pce-wson-rwa-ext-00.txt>

    This draft provides the Path Computation Element communication
       Protocol (PCEP) extensions for the support of Routing and Wavelength
       Assignment (RWA) in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON).
       Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a routing and wavelength
       assignment (RWA) process.  From a path computation perspective,
       wavelength assignment is the process of determining which wavelength
       can be used on each hop of a path and forms an additional routing
       constraint to optical light path computation.

Port Control Protocol (pcp)
---------------------------

  "The Port Control Protocol in Dual-Stack Lite environments", Francis
  Dupont, Tina Tsou, Jacni Qin, Margaret Wasserman, Dacheng Zhang,

    This document specifies the so-called "plain mode" for the use of the
       Port Control Protocol (PCP) in Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite)
       environments.

  "DHCP Options for the Port Control Protocol (PCP)", Mohamed Boucadair,
  Reinaldo Penno, Dan Wing, 27-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-pcp-dhcp-07.txt>

    This document specifies DHCP (IPv4 and IPv6) options to configure
       hosts with Port Control Protocol (PCP) Server names.  The use of
       DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 depends on the PCP deployment scenario.

  "Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Internet Gateway Device (IGD)-Port
  Control Protocol (PCP) Interworking Function", Mohamed Boucadair,
  Reinaldo Penno, Dan Wing, 26-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-pcp-upnp-igd-interworking-10.txt>

    This document specifies the behavior of the UPnP IGD (Internet
       Gateway Device)/PCP Interworking Function.  A UPnP IGD-PCP
       Interworking Function (IGD-PCP IWF) is required to be embedded in CP
       (Customer Premises) routers to allow for transparent NAT control in
       environments where UPnP IGD is used on the LAN side and PCP on the
       external side of the CP router.

  "Port Control Protocol (PCP) Proxy Function", Mohamed Boucadair,
  Reinaldo Penno, Dan Wing, 18-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-pcp-proxy-03.txt>

    This document specifies a new PCP functional element denoted as PCP
       Proxy.  The PCP Proxy relays PCP requests received from PCP Clients
       to upstream PCP Server(s).  This function is mandatory when PCP
       Clients can not be configured with the address of the PCP Server
       located more than one hop.

  "PCP Server Selection", Mohamed Boucadair, Reinaldo Penno, Dan Wing,
  Prashanth Patil, Tirumaleswar Reddy, 22-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-pcp-server-selection-01.txt>

    This document specifies the behavior to be followed by the PCP client
       to contact its PCP server(s) when one or several PCP server names are
       configured.  Multiple names may be configured to a PCP client in some
       deployment contexts such as multi-homing.
    
       This document updates RFC6887.

  "Learning NAT64 PREFIX64s using PCP", Mohamed Boucadair, 5-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-pcp-nat64-prefix64-03.txt>

    This document defines a new PCP extension to learn the IPv6
       prefix(es) used by a PCP-controlled NAT64 device to build
       IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses.  This extension is needed for
       successful communications when IPv4 addresses are used in referrals.

  "PCP Description Option", Mohamed Boucadair, Reinaldo Penno, Dan Wing,
  20-May-13, <draft-ietf-pcp-description-option-01.txt>

    This document extends Port Control Protocol (PCP) with the ability to
       associate a description with a PCP-instantiated mapping.  It does so
       by defining a new DESCRIPTION option.

  "Port Control Protocol (PCP) Extension for Port Set Allocation", Qiong
  Sun, Mohamed Boucadair, Senthil Sivakumar, Cathy Zhou, Tina Tsou, Simon
  Perreault, 20-May-13, <draft-ietf-pcp-port-set-01.txt>

    This document defines an extension to PCP allowing clients to
       manipulate sets of ports as a whole.  This is accomplished by a new
       MAP option: PORT_SET.

  "The Port Control Protocol in Dual-Stack Lite environments", Francis
  Dupont, Tina Tsou, Jacni Qin, Margaret Wasserman, Dacheng Zhang,
  13-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-pcp-dslite-00.txt>

    This document specifies the so-called "plain mode" for the use of the
       Port Control Protocol (PCP) in Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite)
       environments.

Protocol Independent Multicast (pim)
------------------------------------

  "IGMP/MLD-Based Explicit Membership Tracking Function for Multicast
  Routers", Hitoshi Asaeda, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-pim-explicit-tracking-05.txt>

    This document describes the IGMP/MLD-based explicit membership
       tracking function for multicast routers supporting IGMPv3/MLDv2.  The
       explicit tracking function contributes to saving network resources
       and fast leaves (i.e. shortening leave latency).

  "Protocol Independent Multicast DR Load Balancing", Yiqun Cai, Sri
  Vallepalli, Heidi Ou, Andy Green, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-pim-drlb-02.txt>

    On a multi-access network such as an Ethernet, one of the PIM routers
       is elected as a Designated Router (DR).  The PIM DR has two roles in
       the PIM protocol.  On the first hop network, the PIM DR is
       responsible for registering an active source to the RP if the group
       is operated in PIM SM.  On the last hop network, the PIM DR is
       responsible for tracking local multicast listeners and forwarding
       traffic to these listeners if the group is operated in PIM SM/SSM/DM.
       In this document, we propose a modification to the PIM protocol that
       allows more than one of these last hop routers to be selected so that
       the forwarding load can be distributed to and handled among these
       routers.  A router responsible for forwarding for a particular group
       is called a Group Designated Router (GDR).

  "Survey Report on PIM-SM Implementations and Deployments", Lianshu
  Zheng, Jeffrey Zhang, Rishabh Parekh, 12-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-pim-rfc4601-update-survey-report-02.txt>

  Krishnaswamy, Apoorva Karan, Vishal Arya, 6-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-pim-explicit-rpf-vector-00.txt>

    This document describes a use of the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF)
       Vector TLV as defined in [RPC 5496] to build multicast trees via an
       explicitly configured path sent in the PIM join.

Public-Key Infrastructure (X.509) (pkix)
----------------------------------------

  "Enrollment over Secure Transport", Max Pritikin, Peter Yee, Dan
  Harkins, 9-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-pkix-est-07.txt>

    This document profiles certificate enrollment for clients using
       Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) messages over a secure
       transport.  This profile, called Enrollment over Secure Transport
       (EST), describes a simple yet functional certificate management
       protocol targeting Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) clients that need
       to acquire client certificates and associated Certification Authority
       (CA) certificate(s).  It also supports client-generated public/
       private key pairs as well as key pairs generated by the CA.

Peer to Peer Streaming Protocol (ppsp)
--------------------------------------

  "Problem Statement and Requirements of Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol
  (PPSP)", Yunfei Zhang, Ning Zong, 13-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-ppsp-problem-statement-15.txt>

    Peer-to-Peer(P2P for short) streaming systems show more and more
       popularity in current Internet with proprietary protocols.  This
       document identifies problems of the proprietary protocols, proposes
       the development of Peer to Peer Streaming Protocol(PPSP) including
       the tracker and peer protocol, and discusses the scope, requirements
       and use cases of PPSP.

  "Survey of P2P Streaming Applications", Gu Yingjie, Ning Zong, Yunfei
  Zhang, Francesca Piccolo, Shihui Duan, 24-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-ppsp-survey-04.txt>

    This document presents a survey of some of the most popular Peer-to-
       Peer (P2P) streaming applications on the Internet.  Main selection
       criteria were popularity and availability of information on operation
       details at writing time.  In doing this, selected applications will
       not be reviewed as a whole, but we will focus exclusively on the
       signaling and control protocol used to establish and maintain overlay
       connections among peers and to advertise and download streaming
       content.

  "Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol (PPSPP)", A. Bakker, Riccardo
  Petrocco, Victor Grishchenko, 11-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-ppsp-peer-protocol-06.txt>

    The Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol (PPSPP) is a transport
       protocol for disseminating the same content to a group of interested
       parties in a streaming fashion.  PPSPP supports streaming of both
       pre-recorded (on-demand) and live audio/video content.  It is based
       on the peer-to-peer paradigm, where clients consuming the content are
       put on equal footing with the servers initially providing the
       content, to create a system where everyone can potentially provide
       upload bandwidth.  It has been designed to provide short time-till-
       playback for the end user, and to prevent disruption of the streams
       by malicious peers.  PPSPP has also been designed to be flexible and
       extensible.  It can use different mechanisms to optimize peer
       uploading, prevent freeriding, and work with different peer discovery
       schemes (centralized trackers or Distributed Hash Tables).  It
       supports multiple methods for content integrity protection and chunk
       addressing.  Designed as a generic protocol that can run on top of
       various transport protocols, it currently runs on top of UDP using
       LEDBAT for congestion control.

    This document specifies the base Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol-
       Tracker Protocol (PPSP-TP/1.0), an application-layer control
       (signaling) protocol for the exchange of meta information between
       trackers and peers.  The specification outlines the architecture of
       the protocol and its functionality, and describes message flows,
       message processing instructions, message formats, formal syntax and
       semantics.  The PPSP Tracker Protocol enables cooperating peers to
       form content streaming overlay networks to support near real-time
       Structured Media content delivery (audio, video, associated timed
       text and metadata), such as adaptive multi-rate, layered (scalable)
       and multi-view (3D) videos, in live, time-shifted and on-demand
       modes.

Preparation and Comparison of Internationalized Strings (precis)
----------------------------------------------------------------

  "PRECIS Framework: Preparation and Comparison of Internationalized
  Strings in Application Protocols", Peter Saint-Andre, Marc Blanchet,
  25-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-precis-framework-08.txt>

    Application protocols using Unicode code points in protocol strings
       need to properly prepare such strings in order to perform valid
       comparison operations (e.g., for purposes of authentication or
       authorization).  This document defines a framework enabling
       application protocols to perform the preparation and comparison of
       internationalized strings (a.k.a.  "PRECIS") in a way that depends on
       the properties of Unicode code points and thus is agile with respect
       to versions of Unicode.  As a result, this framework provides a more
       sustainable approach to the handling of internationalized strings
       than the previous framework, known as Stringprep (RFC 3454).  A
       specification that reuses this framework can either directly use the
       PRECIS string classes or subclass the PRECIS string classes as
       needed.  This framework takes an approach similar to the revised
       internationalized domain names (IDNs) in applications (IDNA)
       technology (RFC 5890, RFC 5891, RFC 5892, RFC 5893, RFC 5894) and
       thus adheres to the high-level design goals described in the IAB's
       recommendations regarding IDNs (RFC 4690), albeit for application
       technologies other than the Domain Name System (DNS).  This document
       obsoletes RFC 3454.

  "Mapping characters for PRECIS classes", Yoshiro Yoneya, Takahiro
  NEMOTO, 24-May-13, <draft-ietf-precis-mappings-02.txt>

    The framework for preparation and comparison of internationalized
       strings ("PRECIS") defines several classes of strings for preparation
       and comparison.  In the framework, case mapping is defined because
       many protocols handle case-sensitive or case-insensitive string
       comparison and therefore preparation of the string is mandatory.  As
       described in the mapping for Internationalized Domain Names in
       Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS problem statement, mappings for
       internationalized strings are not limited to case, but also width
       mapping and mapping of delimiters and other specials can be taken
       into consideration.  This document provides guidelines for authors of
       protocol profiles of the PRECIS framework and describes several
       mappings that can be applied between receiving user input and passing
       permitted code points to internationalized protocols.  The mappings
       described here are expected to be applied as Addtional mapping in the
       PRECIS framework.

  "Preparation and Comparison of Internationalized Strings Representing
  Simple User Names and Passwords", Peter Saint-Andre, Alexey Melnikov,
  25-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-precis-saslprepbis-02.txt>

    This document describes how to handle Unicode strings representing
       simple user names and passwords, primarily for purposes of
       comparison.  This profile is intended to be used by Simple
       Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanisms (such as PLAIN
       and SCRAM-SHA-1), as well as other protocols that exchange simple
       user names or passwords.  This document obsoletes RFC 4013.

Pseudowire Emulation Edge to Edge (pwe3)
----------------------------------------

  "Dynamic Placement of Multi Segment Pseudowires", Luca Martini, Matthew
  Bocci, Florin Balus, 19-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw-17.txt>

    There is a requirement for service providers to be able to extend the
       reach of pseudowires (PW) across multiple Packet Switched Network
       domains. A Multi-Segment PW is defined as a set of two or more
       contiguous PW segments that behave and function as a single point-
       to-point PW. This document describes extensions to the PW control
       protocol to dynamically place the segments of the multi segment
       pseudowire among a set of Provider Edge (PE) routers.

  "MPLS and Ethernet OAM Interworking", Dinesh Mohan, Nabil Bitar, Ali
  Sajassi, 30-Jan-13, <draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-eth-oam-iwk-07.txt>

    This document specifies the mapping of defect states between
         Ethernet Attachment Circuits (ACs) and associated Ethernet
         Pseudowires (PWs) connected in accordance to the PWE3 architecture
         to realize an end-to-end emulated Ethernet service. It standardizes
         the behavior of Provider Edges (PEs) with respect to Ethernet PW
         and AC defects.

  "Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol for L2VPN PE Redundancy", Luca
  Martini, Samer Salam, Ali Sajassi, Satoru Matsushima, 21-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-iccp-11.txt>

    This document specifies an inter-chassis communication protocol
       (ICCP) that enables Provider Edge (PE) device redundancy for Virtual
       Private Wire Service (VPWS) and Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)
       applications. The protocol runs within a set of two or more PEs,
       forming a redundancy group, for the purpose of synchronizing data
       amongst the systems. It accommodates multi-chassis attachment circuit
       as well as pseudowire redundancy mechanisms.

  "MPLS LSP PW status refresh reduction for Static Pseudowires", Luca
  Martini, George Swallow, Elisa Bellagamba, 20-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-status-reduction-01.txt>

    This document describes a method for generating an aggregated
       pseudowire status message on Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
       network Label Switched Path (LSP).
    
       The method for transmitting the pseudowire (PW) status information is
       not new, however this protocol extension allows a Service Provider
       (SP) to reliably monitor the individual PW status while not
       overwhelming the network of multiple periodic status messages. This
       is achieved by sending a single cumulative summary status
       verification message for all the PWs grouped in the same LSP.

  "Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance using the Label Distribution
  Protocol", Luca Martini, Giles Heron, 20-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-rfc4447bis-01.txt>

    Layer 2 services (such as Frame Relay, Asynchronus Transfer Mode, and
       Ethernet) can be "emulated" over an MPLS backbone by encapsulating
       the Layer 2 Packet Data Units (PDU) and then transmitting them over
       "pseudowires". It is also possible to use pseudowires to provide
       low-rate Time Dividion Multiplexed and Synchronous Optical NETworking
       circuit emulation over a MPLS-enabled network. This document
       specifies a protocol for establishing and maintaining the
       pseudowires, using extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol
       (LDP).  Procedures for encapsulating Layer 2 PDUs are specified in a
       set of companion documents.

  "LDP extensions for Pseudowire Binding to LSP Tunnels", Mach Chen, Wei
  Cao, Attila Takacs, Ping Pan, 3-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-tp-pw-over-bidir-lsp-01.txt>

    Many transport services require that user traffic, in the forms of
       Pseudowires (PW), to be delivered on a single co-routed bidirectional
       LSP or two LSPs that share the same routes.  In addition, the user
       traffic may traverse through multiple transport networks.
    
       This document specifies an optional extension in LDP that enable the
       binding between PWs and the underlying LSPs.

  "Pseudowire Redundancy on S-PE", Jie Dong, Haibo Wang, 21-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-redundancy-spe-01.txt>

    This document describes Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) protection
       scenarios in which the pseudowire redundancy is provided on the
       Switching-PE (S-PE).  Operations of the S-PEs which provide PW
       redundancy are specified in this document.  Signaling of the
       preferential forwarding status as defined in [RFC6870] is reused.
       This document does not require any change to the T-PEs of MS-PW.

  "VCCV MPLS-TP Connectivity Verification (CV) Capability Advertisement",
  Greg Mirsky, 8-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-tp-cv-adv-00.txt>

    This document specifies how use of proactive Connectivity
       Verification, Continuity Check, and Remote Defect Indication for the
       MPLS Transport Profile [RFC6428] affects operation and management
       function election for PW VCCV [RFC5085], [RFC5885].

IMAP QRESYNC Extension (qresync)
--------------------------------

  "IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE Operation or Quick Flag Changes
  Resynchronization", Alexey Melnikov, 6-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-qresync-rfc4551bis-01.txt>

    Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate changes to
       a common IMAP mailbox.  Examples include different clients working on
       behalf of the same user, and multiple users accessing shared
       mailboxes.  These clients need a mechanism to synchronize state
       changes for messages within the mailbox.  They must be able to
       guarantee that only one client can change message state (e.g.,
       message flags) at any time.  An example of such an application is use
       of an IMAP mailbox as a message queue with multiple dequeueing
       clients.
    
       The Conditional Store facility provides a protected update mechanism
       for message state information that can detect and resolve conflicts
       between multiple writing mail clients.
    
       The Conditional Store facility also allows a client to quickly
       resynchronize mailbox flag changes.
    
       This document defines an extension to IMAP (RFC 3501).

  "IMAP4 Extensions for Quick Mailbox Resynchronization", Alexey Melnikov,
  Dave Cridland, 30-May-13, <draft-ietf-qresync-rfc5162bis-00.txt>

    This document defines an IMAP4 extension, which gives an IMAP client
       the ability to quickly resynchronize any previously opened mailbox as
       part of the SELECT command, without the need for server-side state or
       additional client round-trips.  This extension also introduces a new
       response that allows for a more compact representation of a list of
       expunged messages (and always includes the Unique Identifiers (UIDs)
       expunged).

RADIUS EXTensions (radext)
--------------------------

  "NAI-based Dynamic Peer Discovery for RADIUS/TLS and RADIUS/DTLS",
  Stefan Winter, Mike McCauley, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-radext-dynamic-discovery-06.txt>

    This document specifies a means to find authoritative RADIUS servers
       for a given realm.  It is used in conjunction with either RADIUS/TLS
       and RADIUS/DTLS.

  "DTLS as a Transport Layer for RADIUS", Alan DeKok, 17-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-radext-dtls-05.txt>

    The RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] has limited support for authentication
       and encryption of RADIUS packets.  The protocol transports data "in
       the clear", although some parts of the packets can have "obfuscated"
       content.  Packets may be replayed verbatim by an attacker, and
       client-server authentication is based on fixed shared secrets.  This
       document specifies how the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
       protocol may be used as a fix for these problems.  It also describes
       how implementations of this proposal can co-exist with current RADIUS
       systems.

  "RADIUS Attributes for IEEE 802 Networks", Bernard Aboba, Jouni Malinen,
  Paul Congdon, Joseph Salowey, Mark Jones, 9-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-radext-ieee802ext-07.txt>

    RFC 3580 provides guidelines for the use of the Remote Authentication
       Dialin User Service (RADIUS) within IEEE 802 local area networks
       (LANs).  This document proposes additional attributes for use within
       IEEE 802 networks, as well as clarifications on the usage of the EAP-
       Key-Name attribute, updating RFC 4072.  The attributes defined in
       this document are usable both within RADIUS and Diameter.

  "The Network Access Identifier", Alan DeKok, 23-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-radext-nai-03.txt>

    In order to provide inter-domain authentication services, it is
       necessary to have a standardized method that domains can use to
       identify each others users.  This document defines the syntax for the
       Network Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity submitted by the
       client prior to accessing network resources. This document is a
       revised version of RFC 4282 [RFC4282], which addresses issues with
       international character sets, as well as a number of other
       corrections to the previous document.

Real-time Applications and Infrastructure Area (rai)
----------------------------------------------------

  "Considerations for Information Services and Operator Services Using
  SIP", John Haluska, Richard Ahern, Marty Cruze, Chris Blackwell,
  15-Aug-11, <draft-haluska-sipping-directory-assistance-11.txt>

    Information Services are services whereby information is provided in
       response to user requests, and may include involvement of a human or
       automated agent. A popular existing Information Service is Directory
       Assistance (DA). Moving ahead, Information Services providers
       envision exciting multimedia services that support simultaneous
       voice and data interactions with full operator backup at any time
       during the call. Information Services providers are planning to
       migrate to SIP based platforms, which will enable such advanced
       services, while continuing to support traditional DA services.
    
       Operator Services are traditional PSTN services which often involve
       providing human or automated assistance to a caller, and often
       require the specialized capabilities traditionally provided by an
       operator services switch. Market and/or regulatory factors in some
       jurisdictions dictate that some subset of Operator Services continue
       to be provided going forward.
    
       This document aims to identify how Operator and Information Services
       can be implemented using existing or currently proposed SIP
       mechanisms, to identity existing protocol gaps, and to provide a set
       of Best Current Practices to facilitate interoperability. For
       Operator Services, the intention is to describe how current operator
       services can continue to be provided to PSTN based subscribers via a
       SIP based operator services architecture. It also looks at how
       current operator services might be provided to SIP based subscribers
       via such an architecture, but does not consider the larger question
       of the need for or usefulness or suitability of each of these
       services for SIP based subscribers.
    
       This document addresses the needs of current Operator and
       Information Services providers; as such, the intended audience
       includes vendors of equipment and services to such providers.

  "A Uniform Resource Name Namespace for the GSM Association (GSMA) and
  the International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI)", Michael
  Montemurro, Andrew Allen, David McDonald, Paul Gosden, 6-May-13,
  <draft-montemurro-gsma-imei-urn-14.txt>

    This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name namespace for the
       GSMA (GSM Association)and a sub-namespace for the IMEI (International
       Mobile station Equipment Identity), and associated parameter for the
       IMEISV (International Mobile station Equipment Identity and Software
       Version number).  The IMEI is 15 decimal digits long and the IMEISV
       is 16 decimal digits long and both are encoded using Binary Encoded
       Decimal (BCD).  The IMEI and IMEISV were introduced as part of the
       specification for Global System for Mobile communications(GSM) and
       are also now incorporated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project
       (3GPP) as part of the 3GPP specification for GSM, the Universal
       Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and 3GPP LTE (Long Term
       Evolution).  The IMEI and IMEISV are used to uniquely identify Mobile
       Equipment within these systems and are managed by the GSMA.

  "IANA Registering a SIP Resource Priority Header Field Namespace for
  Local Emergency Communications", James Polk, 23-Feb-13,
  <draft-polk-local-emergency-rph-namespace-05.txt>

    This document creates the new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
       Resource Priority header field namespace 'esnet' for local emergency
       session establishment to a public safety answering point (PSAP),
       between PSAPs, and between a PSAP and first responders and their
       organizations, and places this namespace in the IANA registry.

Reputation Services (repute)
----------------------------

  "A Reputation Response Set for Email Identifiers", Nathaniel Borenstein,
  Murray Kucherawy, 6-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-repute-email-identifiers-08.txt>

    This document defines a response set for describing assertions a
       reputation service provider can make about email identifers, for use
       in generating reputons.

  "A Media Type for Reputation Interchange", Nathaniel Borenstein, Murray
  Kucherawy, 6-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-repute-media-type-08.txt>

    This document defines the format of reputation response data
       ("reputons"), the media-type for packaging it, and definition of a
       registry for the names of reputation applications and response sets.

  "A Reputation Query Protocol", Nathaniel Borenstein, Murray Kucherawy,
  6-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-repute-query-http-07.txt>

    This document defines a mechanism to conduct queries for reputation
       information over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol using JSON as the
       payload meta-format.

  "A Model for Reputation Reporting", Nathaniel Borenstein, Murray
  Kucherawy, Andrew Sullivan, 6-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-repute-model-05.txt>

    This document describes a general architecture for a reputation-based
       service and a model for requesting reputation-related data over the
       Internet, where "reputation" refers to predictions or expectations
       about an entity or an identifier such as a domain name.  The document
       roughly follows the recommendations of RFC4101 for describing a
       protocol model.

  "Operational Considerations Regarding Reputation Services", Murray
  Kucherawy, 20-May-13, <draft-ietf-repute-considerations-02.txt>

    The use of reputation systems is has become a common tool in many
       applications that seek to apply collected intelligence about traffic
       sources.  Often this is done because it is common or even expected
       operator practice.  It is therefore important to be aware of a number
       of considerations for both operators and consumers of the data.  This
       document includes a collection of the best advice available regarding
       providers and consumers of reputation data, based on experience to
       date.  Much of this is based on experience with email reputation
       systems, but the concepts are generally applicable.

RTP Media Congestion Avoidance Techniques (rmcat)
-------------------------------------------------

  "Evaluating Congestion Control for Interactive Real-time Media", Varun
  Singh, Joerg Ott, 25-Feb-13, <draft-singh-rmcat-cc-eval-02.txt>

    The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to transmit media in
       telephony and video conferencing applications.  This document
       describes the guidelines to evaluate new congestion control
       algorithms for interactive point-to-point real-time media.

  "Congestion Control Requirements For RMCAT", Randell Jesup, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-jesup-rmcat-reqs-01.txt>

    Congestion control is needed for all data transported across the
       Internet, in order to promote fair usage and prevent congestion
       collapse.  The requirements for interactive, point-to-point real time
       multimedia, which needs by low-delay, semi-reliable data delivery,
       are different from the requirements for bulk transfer like FTP or
       bursty transfers like Web pages, and the TCP algorithms are not
       suitable for this traffic.
    
       This document attempts to describe a set of requirements that can be
       used to evaluate other congestion control mechanisms in order to
       figure out their fitness for this purpose, and in particular to
       provide a set of possible requirements for proposals coming out of
       the RMCAT Working Group.
    
       This document is derived from draft-jesup-rtp-congestion-reqs
       [I-D.jesup-rtp-congestion-reqs].

Reliable Multicast Transport (rmt)
----------------------------------

  "Security and Reliable Multicast Transport Protocols: Discussions and
  Guidelines", Brian Adamson, Vincent Roca, Hitoshi Asaeda, 17-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-rmt-sec-discussion-08.txt,.pdf>

    This document describes general security considerations for Reliable
       Multicast Transport (RMT) building blocks and protocols.  An emphasis
       is placed on risks that might be resolved in the scope of transport
       protocol design.  However, relevant security issues related to IP
       Multicast control-plane and other concerns not strictly within the
       scope of reliable transport protocol design are also discussed.  The
       document also begins an exploration of approaches that could be
       embraced to mitigate these risks.  The purpose of this document is to
       provide a consolidated security discussion and provide a basis for
       further discussions and potential resolution of any significant
       security issues that may exist in the current set of RMT standards.

  "FCAST: Object Delivery for the ALC and NORM Protocols", Vincent Roca,
  Brian Adamson, 26-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-rmt-fcast-08.txt>

    This document introduces the FCAST reliable object (e.g., file)
       delivery application.  It is designed to operate either on top of the
       underlying Asynchronous Layer Coding (ALC)/Layered Coding Transport
       (LCT) or the NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) reliable
       multicast transport protocols.

Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks (roll)
------------------------------------------------

  "Terminology in Low power And Lossy Networks", JP Vasseur, 12-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-roll-terminology-12.txt>

    The documents defines a terminology for discussing routing
    requirements and solutions for networks referred to as Low power and
    Lossy Networks (LLN).  An LLN is typically composed of many embedded
    devices with limited power, memory, and processing resources
    interconnected by a variety of links.  There is a wide scope of
    application areas for LLNs, including industrial monitoring, building
    automation (e.g.  Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning, lighting,
    access control, fire), connected home, healthcare, environmental
    monitoring, urban sensor networks, energy management, assets
    tracking, refrigeration.

  "Reactive Discovery of Point-to-Point Routes in Low Power and Lossy
  Networks", Mukul Goyal, Emmanuel Baccelli, Matthias Philipp, Anders
  Brandt, Jerry Martocci, 20-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-roll-p2p-rpl-17.txt>

    This document specifies a point-to-point route discovery mechanism,
       complementary to the RPL core functionality.  This mechanism allows
       an IPv6 router to discover "on demand" routes to one or more IPv6
       routers in the LLN such that the discovered routes meet specified
       metrics constraints.

  "A Mechanism to Measure the Routing Metrics along a Point-to-point Route
  in a Low Power and Lossy Network", Mukul Goyal, Emmanuel Baccelli,
  Anders Brandt, Jerry Martocci, 1-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-roll-p2p-measurement-10.txt>

    This document specifies a mechanism that enables an RPL router to
       measure the aggregated values of given routing metrics along an
       existing route towards another RPL router, thereby allowing the
       router to decide if it wants to initiate the discovery of a better
       route.

  "Multicast Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (MPL)", Jonathan
  Hui, Richard Kelsey, 25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-roll-trickle-mcast-04.txt>

    This document specifies the Multicast Protocol for Low power and
       Lossy Networks (MPL) that provides IPv6 multicast forwarding in
       constrained networks.  MPL avoids the need to construct or maintain
       any multicast forwarding topology, disseminating messages to all MPL
       Forwarders in an MPL Domain.  MPL uses the Trickle algorithm to
       manage message transmissions for both control and data-plane
       messages.  Different Trickle parameter configurations allow MPL to
       trade between dissemination latency and transmission efficiency.

  "A Security Threat Analysis for Routing over Low-Power and Lossy
  Networks", Tzeta Tsao, Roger Alexander, Mischa Dohler, Vanesa Daza,
  Angel Lozano, 12-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-roll-security-threats-02.txt>

    This document presents a security threat analysis for routing over
       low-power and lossy networks (LLN).  The development builds upon
       previous work on routing security and adapts the assessments to the
       issues and constraints specific to low-power and lossy networks.  A
       systematic approach is used in defining and evaluating the security
       threats.  Applicable countermeasures are application specific and are
       addressed in relevant applicability statements.  These assessments
       provide the basis of the security recommendations for incorporation
       into low-power, lossy network routing protocols.

  "ROLL Applicability Statement Template", Michael Richardson, 11-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-roll-applicability-template-00.txt>

    This document is a template applicability statement for the Routing
       over Low-power and Lossy Networks (ROLL) WG.  This document is not
       for publication, but rather is to be used as a template.

  "RPL applicability in industrial networks", Tom Phinney, Pascal Thubert,

    The wide deployment of wireless devices, with their low installed
       cost (compared to wired devices), will significantly improve the
       productivity and safety of industrial plants.  It will simultaneously
       increase the efficiency and safety of the plant's workers, by
       extending and making more timely the information set available about
       plant operations.  The new Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy
       Networks (RPL) defines a Distance Vector protocol that is designed
       for such networks.  The aim of this document is to analyze the
       applicability of that routing protocol in industrial LLNs formed of
       field devices.

       building and home environments.

Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (rtcweb)
------------------------------------------------

  "Overview: Real Time Protocols for Brower-based Applications", Harald
  Alvestrand, 20-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-rtcweb-overview-06.txt>

    This document gives an overview and context of a protocol suite
       intended for use with real-time applications that can be deployed in
       browsers - "real time communication on the Web".
    
       It intends to serve as a starting and coordination point to make sure
       all the parts that are needed to achieve this goal are findable, and
       that the parts that belong in the Internet protocol suite are fully
       specified and on the right publication track.
    
       This document is a work item of the RTCWEB working group.

  "Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC): Media Transport and Use of RTP",
  Colin Perkins, Magnus Westerlund, Joerg Ott, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage-06.txt>

    The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) framework provides support
       for direct interactive rich communication using audio, video, text,
       collaboration, games, etc. between two peers' web-browsers.  This
       memo describes the media transport aspects of the WebRTC framework.
       It specifies how the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in
       the WebRTC context, and gives requirements for which RTP features,
       profiles, and extensions need to be supported.

  "Security Considerations for RTC-Web", Eric Rescorla, 22-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-rtcweb-security-04.txt>

    The Real-Time Communications on the Web (RTC-Web) working group is
       tasked with standardizing protocols for real-time communications
       between Web browsers.  The major use cases for RTC-Web technology are
       real-time audio and/or video calls, Web conferencing, and direct data
       transfer.  Unlike most conventional real-time systems (e.g., SIP-
       based soft phones) RTC-Web communications are directly controlled by
       some Web server, which poses new security challenges.  For instance,
       a Web browser might expose a JavaScript API which allows a server to
       place a video call.  Unrestricted access to such an API would allow
       any site which a user visited to "bug" a user's computer, capturing
       any activity which passed in front of their camera.  This document
       defines the RTC-Web threat model and defines an architecture which
       provides security within that threat model.

  "RTCWEB Security Architecture", Eric Rescorla, 22-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-rtcweb-security-arch-06.txt>

    The Real-Time Communications on the Web (RTCWEB) working group is
       tasked with standardizing protocols for enabling real-time
       communications within user-agents using web technologies (e.g
       JavaScript).  The major use cases for RTCWEB technology are real-time
       audio and/or video calls, Web conferencing, and direct data transfer.
       Unlike most conventional real-time systems (e.g., SIP-based soft
       phones) RTCWEB communications are directly controlled by some Web
       server, which poses new security challenges.  For instance, a Web
       browser might expose a JavaScript API which allows a server to place
       a video call.  Unrestricted access to such an API would allow any
       site which a user visited to "bug" a user's computer, capturing any
       activity which passed in front of their camera.  [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-
       security] defines the RTCWEB threat model.  This document defines an
       architecture which provides security within that threat model.

  "Javascript Session Establishment Protocol", Justin Uberti, Cullen
  Jennings, 27-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-rtcweb-jsep-03.txt>

    This document describes the mechanisms for allowing a Javascript
    application to fully control the signaling plane of a multimedia
    session via the interface specified in the W3C RTCPeerConnection API,
    and discusses how this relates to existing signaling protocols.

  "RTCWeb Data Channels", Randell Jesup, Salvatore Loreto, Michael Tuexen,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-rtcweb-data-channel-04.txt>

    The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) working group is charged to
       provide protocol support for direct interactive rich communication
       using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-browsers.  This
       document specifies the non-media data transport aspects of the WebRTC
       framework.  It provides an architectural overview of how the Stream
       Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is used in the WebRTC context as
       a generic transport service allowing Web Browser to exchange generic
       data from peer to peer.

  "A Record of Discussions of Graceful Restart Extensions for
  Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)", Palanivelan Appanasamy,
  17-Nov-11, <draft-palanivelan-bfd-v2-gr-13.txt>

    This document is a historical record of discussions about extending
       the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol to provide
       additional capabilities to handle Graceful Restart.
    
       These discussions took place in the context of the IETF's BFD working
       group, and the consensus in that group was that these extensions
       should not be made.
    
       This document presents a summary of the challenges to BFD in
       surviving a graceful restart, and outlines a potential protocol
       solution that was discussed and rejected within the BFD working
       group.  The purpose of this document is to provide a record of the
       work done so that future effort will not be wasted.  This document
       does not propose or document any extensions to BFD, and there is no
       intention that it should be implemented in its current form.

Routing Area Working Group (rtgwg)
----------------------------------

  "Framework for Loop-free convergence using oFIB", Mike Shand, Stewart
  Bryant, Stefano Previdi, Clarence Filsfils, Pierre Francois, Olivier
  Bonaventure, 24-May-13, <draft-ietf-rtgwg-ordered-fib-12.txt>

    This document describes an illustrative framework of a mechanism for
       use in conjunction with link state routing protocols which prevents
       the transient loops which would otherwise occur during topology
       changes.  It does this by correctly sequencing the forwarding
       information base (FIB) updates on the routers.
    
       This mechanism can be used in the case of non-urgent (management
       action) link or node shutdowns and restarts or link metric changes.
       It can also be used in conjunction with a fast re-route mechanism
       which converts a sudden link or node failure into a non-urgent
       topology change.  This is possible where a complete repair path is
       provided for all affected destinations.
    
       After a non-urgent topology change, each router computes a rank that
       defines the time at which it can safely update its FIB.  A method for
       accelerating this loop-free convergence process by the use of
       completion messages is also described.
    
       The technology described in this document has been subject to
       extensive simulation using real network topologies and costs, and
       pathological convergence behaviour.  However the mechanism described
       in this document are purely illustrative of the general approach and
       do not constitute a protocol specification.  The document represents
       a snapshot of the work of the Routing Area Working Group at the time
       of publication and is published as a document of record.  Further
       work is needed before implementation or deployment.

  "A Framework for IP and MPLS Fast Reroute Using Not-via Addresses",
  Stewart Bryant, Stefano Previdi, Mike Shand, 24-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-notvia-addresses-11.txt>

    This document presents an illustrative framework for providing fast
       reroute in an IP or MPLS network through encapsulation and forwarding
       to "not-via" addresses.  The general approach described uses a single
       level of encapsulation and could be used to protect unicast,
       multicast, and LDP traffic against link, router, and shared risk
       group failure, regardless of network topology and metrics.
    
       The mechanisms presented in this document are purely illustrative of
       the general approach and do not constitute a protocol specification.
       The document represents a snapshot of the work of the Routing Area
       Working Group at the time of publication and is published as a
       document of record.  Further work is needed before implementation or
       deployment.

  "Requirements for Composite Links in MPLS Networks", Curtis Villamizar,
  Dave McDysan, So Ning, Andrew Malis, Lucy Yong, 22-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-rtgwg-cl-requirement-10.txt>

    There is often a need to provide large aggregates of bandwidth that
       are best provided using parallel links between routers or MPLS LSR.
       In core networks there is often no alternative since the aggregate
       capacities of core networks today far exceed the capacity of a single
       physical link or single packet processing element.
    
       The presence of parallel links, with each link potentially comprised
       of multiple layers has resulted in additional requirements.  Certain
       services may benefit from being restricted to a subset of the
       component links or a specific component link, where component link
       characteristics, such as latency, differ.  Certain services require
       that an LSP be treated as atomic and avoid reordering.  Other
       services will continue to require only that reordering not occur
       within a microflow as is current practice.

  "An Architecture for IP/LDP Fast-Reroute Using Maximally Redundant
  Trees", Alia Atlas, Robert Kebler, Gabor Envedi, Andras Csaszar, Jeff
  Tantsura, Maciek Konstantynowicz, Russ White, Mike Shand, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture-02.txt>

    As IP and LDP Fast-Reroute are increasingly deployed, the coverage
       limitations of Loop-Free Alternates are seen as a problem that
       requires a straightforward and consistent solution for IP and LDP,
       for unicast and multicast.  This draft describes an architecture
       based on redundant backup trees where a single failure can cut a
       point-of-local-repair from the destination only on one of the pair of
       redundant trees.
    
       One innovative algorithm to compute such topologies is maximally
       disjoint backup trees.  Each router can compute its next-hops for
       each pair of maximally disjoint trees rooted at each node in the IGP
       area with computational complexity similar to that required by
       Dijkstra.
    
       The additional state, address and computation requirements are
       believed to be significantly less than the Not-Via architecture
       requires.

  "Remote LFA FRR", Stewart Bryant, Clarence Filsfils, Stefano Previdi,
  Mike Shand, So Ning, 23-May-13, <draft-ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa-02.txt>

    This draft describes an extension to the basic IP fast re-route
       mechanism described in RFC5286 that provides additional backup
       connectivity for link failures when none can be provided by the basic
       mechanisms.

  "Composite Link Framework in Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)", So
  Ning, Dave McDysan, Eric Osborne, Lucy Yong, Curtis Villamizar,
  15-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-rtgwg-cl-framework-03.txt>

    This document specifies a framework for support of composite link in
       MPLS networks.  A composite link consists of a group of homogenous or
       non-homogenous links that have the same forward adjacency and can be
       considered as a single TE link or an IP link in routing.  A composite
       link relies on its component links to carry the traffic over the
       composite link.  Applicability is described for a single pair of
       MPLS-capable nodes, a sequence of MPLS-capable nodes, or a set of
       layer networks connecting MPLS-capable nodes.

  "Composite Link Use Cases and Design Considerations", So Ning, Andrew
  Malis, Dave McDysan, Lucy Yong, Curtis Villamizar, 15-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-rtgwg-cl-use-cases-03.txt>

    This document provides a set of use cases and design considerations
       for composite links.
    
       Composite link is a formalization of multipath techniques currently
       in use in IP and MPLS networks and a set of extensions to existing
       multipath techniques.

  "Multicast only Fast Re-Route", Apoorva Karan, Clarence Filsfils, Dino
  Farinacci, IJsbrand Wijnands, Bruno Decraene, Uwe Joorde, Wim
  Henderickx, 21-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-rtgwg-mofrr-02.txt>

    As IPTV deployments grow in number and size, service providers are
       looking for solutions that minimize the service disruption due to
       faults in the IP network carrying the packets for these services.
       This draft describes a mechanism for minimizing packet loss in a
       network when node or link failures occur.  Multicast only Fast Re-
       Route (MoFRR) works by making simple enhancements to multicast
       routing protocols such as PIM and mLDP.

  "Operational management of Loop Free Alternates", Stephane Litkowski,
  Bruno Decraene, Clarence Filsfils, Kamran Raza, 13-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-rtgwg-lfa-manageability-00.txt>

    Loop Free Alternates (LFA), as defined in RFC 5286 is an IP Fast
       ReRoute (IP FRR) mechanism enabling traffic protection for IP traffic
       (and MPLS LDP traffic by extension).  Following first deployment
       experiences, this document provides operational feedback on LFA,
       highlights some limitations, and proposes a set of refinements to
       address those limitations.  It also proposes required management
       specifications.
    
       This proposal is also applicable to remote LFA solution.

Source Address Validation Improvements (savi)
---------------------------------------------

  "SEND-based Source-Address Validation Implementation", Marcelo Bagnulo,
  Alberto Garcia-Martinez, 26-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-savi-send-10.txt>

    This memo describes SEND SAVI, a mechanism to provide source address
       validation using the SEND protocol.  The proposed mechanism is
       intended to complement ingress filtering techniques to provide a
       finer granularity on the control of the source addresses used.

  "SAVI Solution for DHCP", Jun Bi, Jianping Wu, Guang Yao, Fred Baker,
  21-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-savi-dhcp-17.txt>

    This document specifies the procedure for creating a binding between
       a DHCPv4/DHCPv6 assigned IP address and a binding anchor on a SAVI
       (Source Address Validation Improvements) device.  The bindings set up
       by this procedure can be used to filter out packets with forged
       source IP address in DHCP scenario.  This mechanism is proposed as a
       complement to ingress filtering to provide finer-grained source IP
       address validation.

  "Source Address Validation Improvement Framework", Jianping Wu, Jun Bi,
  Marcelo Bagnulo, Fred Baker, Christian Vogt, 8-Jan-12,
  <draft-ietf-savi-framework-06.txt>

    Source Address Validation Improvement methods were developed to
       prevent nodes attached to the same IP link from spoofing each other's
       IP addresses, so as to complement ingress filtering with finer-
       grained, standardized IP source address validation.  This document is
       a framework document, which describes and motivates the design of the
       SAVI methods.  Particular SAVI methods are described in other
       documents.

  "SAVI for Mixed Address Assignment Methods Scenario", Jun Bi, Guang Yao,
  Joel Halpern, Eric Levy-Abegnoli, 6-May-13, <draft-ietf-savi-mix-04.txt>

    This document reviews how multiple address discovery methods can
       coexist in a single SAVI device and collisions are resolved when the
       same binding entry is discovered by two or more methods.

System for Cross-domain Identity Management (scim)
--------------------------------------------------

  "System for Cross-Domain Identity Management:Protocol", Trey Drake,
  Chuck Mortimore, Morteza Ansari, Kelly Grizzle, Erik Wahlstroem,
  15-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-scim-api-01.txt>

    The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
       is designed to make managing user identity in cloud based
       applications and services easier.  The specification suite seeks to
       build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing
       specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while
       applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models.
       It's intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management
       operations by providing a common user schema and extension model, as
       well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this
       schema using standard protocols.  In essence, make it fast, cheap,
       and easy to move users in to, out of, and around the cloud.

  "System for Cross-Domain Identity Management: Core Schema", Chuck
  Mortimore, Patrick Harding, Paul Madsen, Trey Drake, 15-Apr-13,

       This document provides a platform neutral schema and extension model
       for representing users and groups in JSON format.  This schema is
       intended for exchange and use with cloud service providers.
       Additional binding documents provide a standard REST API, SAML
       binding, and use cases.

-------------------

  "Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol", Max Pritikin, Andrew Nourse, J
  Vilhuber, 7-Sep-11, <draft-nourse-scep-23.txt>

    This document specifies the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol
       (SCEP), a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) communication protocol
       which leverages existing technology by using PKCS#7 and PKCS#10 over
       HTTP.  SCEP is the evolution of the enrollment protocol developed by
       VeriSign, Inc. for Cisco Systems, Inc. It now enjoys wide support in
       both client and a Certification Authority implementations.

  "AES-CCM ECC Cipher Suites for TLS", David McGrew, Daniel Bailey,
  Matthew Campagna, Robert Dugal, 1-Feb-13,
  <draft-mcgrew-tls-aes-ccm-ecc-06.txt>

    This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
       in the Counter and CBC-MAC Mode (CCM) of operation within Transport
       Layer Security (TLS) to provide confidentiality and data origin
       authentication.  The AES-CCM algorithm is amenable to compact
       implementations, making it suitable for constrained environments.
       The ciphersuites defined in this document use Elliptic Curve
       Cryptography (ECC), and are advantageous in networks with limited
       bandwidth.

  "Using the ECC Brainpool Curves for IKEv2 Key Exchange", Johannes
  Merkle, Manfred Lochter, 23-Apr-13,
  <draft-merkle-ikev2-ke-brainpool-06.txt>

    This document specifies the use of ECC Brainpool elliptic curve
       groups for key exchange in the Internet Key Exchange version 2
       (IKEv2) protocol.

  "ECC Brainpool Curves for Transport Layer Security (TLS)", Johannes
  Merkle, Manfred Lochter, 13-May-13, <draft-merkle-tls-brainpool-01.txt>

    This document specifies the use of several ECC Brainpool elliptic
       curves for authentication and key exchange in the Transport Layer
       Security (TLS) protocol.

Secure Inter-Domain Routing (sidr)
----------------------------------

  "Local Trust Anchor Management for the Resource Public Key
  Infrastructure", Mark Reynolds, Stephen Kent, Matt Lepinski, 5-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-ltamgmt-08.txt>

    This document describes a facility to enable a relying party (RP) to
       manage trust anchors (TAs) in the context of the Resource Public Key
       Infrastructure (RPKI). It is common in RP software (not just in the
       RPKI) to allow an RP to import TA material in the form of self-signed
       certificates. However, this approach to incorporating TAs is
       potentially dangerous. (These self-signed certificates rarely
       incorporate any extensions that impose constraints on the scope of
       the imported public keys, and the RP is not able to impose such
       constraints.) The facility described in this document allows an RP to
       impose constraints on such TAs. Because this mechanism is designed to
       operate in the RPKI context, the most important constraints are the
       Internet Number Resources (INRs) expressed via RFC 3779 extensions.
       These extentions bind address spaces and/or autonomous system (AS)
       numbers to entities. The primary motivation for the facility described
       in this document is to enable an RP to ensure that INR information
       that it has acquired via some trusted channel is not overridden by the
       information acquired from the RPKI repository system or by the putative
       TAs that the RP imports. Specifically, the mechanism allows an RP to
       specify a set of overriding bindings between public key identifiers and
       INR data. These bindings take precedence over any conflicting bindings
       acquired by the putative TAs and the certificates downloaded from the
       RPKI repository system. This mechanism is designed for local use by an RP,
       but any entity that is accorded administrative control over a set of RPs
       may use this mechanism to convey its view of the RPKI to RPs within its
       jurisdiction. The means by which this latter use case is effected is
       outside the scope of this document.

  "RPKI-Based Origin Validation Operation", Randy Bush, 20-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-origin-ops-20.txt>

    Deployment of RPKI-based BGP origin validation has many operational
       considerations.  This document attempts to collect and present those
       which are most critical.  It is expected to evolve as RPKI-based
       origin validation continues to be deployed and the dynamics are
       better understood.

  "BGPSEC Protocol Specification", Matt Lepinski, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol-07.txt>

    This document describes BGPSEC, an extension to the Border Gateway
    Protocol (BGP) that provides security for the path of autonomous
    systems through which a BGP update message passes.  BGPSEC is
    implemented via a new optional non-transitive BGP path attribute that
    carries a digital signature produced by each autonomous system that
    propagates the update message.

  "Threat Model for BGP Path Security", Stephen Kent, Andrew Chi,
  26-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-threats-05.txt>

    This document describes a threat model for the context in which BGP
       path security mechanisms will be developed.  It assumes the context
       established by the SIDR WG charter, as of April 19, 2011.  The
       charter established two goals for the SIDR work:
    
       o  Enabling an AS to verify the authorization of an origin AS to

  "Security Requirements for BGP Path Validation", Steven Bellovin, Randy
  Bush, David Ward, 12-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-reqs-07.txt>

    This document describes requirements for a BGP security protocol
       design to provide cryptographic assurance that the origin AS had the
       right to announce the prefix and to provide assurance of the AS Path
       of the announcement.

  "BGP Algorithms, Key Formats, & Signature Formats", Sean Turner,
  26-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-algs-04.txt>

    This document specifies the algorithms, algorithms' parameters,
       asymmetric key formats, asymmetric key size and signature format used
       in BGPSEC (Border Gateway Protocol Security).  This document updates
       the Profile for Algorithms and Key Sizes for use in the Resource
       Public Key Infrastructure (RFC 6485).

  "A Profile for BGPSEC Router Certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists,
  and Certification Requests", Mark Reynolds, Sean Turner, Stephen Kent,
  17-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles-05.txt>

    This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates for
       the purposes of supporting validation of Autonomous System (AS) paths
       in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), as part of an extension to that
       protocol known as BGPSEC.  BGP is a critical component for the proper
       operation of the Internet as a whole.  The BGPSEC protocol is under
       development as a component to address the requirement to provide
       security for the BGP protocol.  The goal of BGPSEC is to design a
       protocol for full AS path validation based on the use of strong
       cryptographic primitives.  The end-entity (EE) certificates specified
       by this profile are issued under Resource Public Key Infrastructure
       (RPKI) Certification Authority (CA) certificates, containing the AS
       Identifier Delegation extension, to routers within the Autonomous
       System (AS).  The certificate asserts that the router(s) holding the
       private key are authorized to send out secure route advertisements on
       behalf of the specified AS.  This document also profiles the
       Certificate Revocation List (CRL), profiles the format of
       certification requests, and specifies Relying Party certificate path
       validation procedures.  The document extends the RPKI; therefore,
       this documents updates the RPKI Resource Certificates Profile (RFC
       6487).

  "Router Keying for BGPsec", Sean Turner, Keyur Patel, Randy Bush,
  23-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-sidr-rtr-keying-01.txt>

    BGPsec-speaking routers must be provisioned with private keys and the
       corresponding public key must be published in the global RPKI
       (Resource Public Key Infrastructure).  This document describes two
       ways of provisioning public/private keys, router-driven and operator-
       driven.

  "Template for a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) for the Resource
  PKI (RPKI)", Karen Seo, 23-Jan-13, <draft-ietf-sidr-cps-01.txt>

    This document contains a template to be used for creating a
       Certification Practice Statement (CPS) for an Organization that is
       part of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), e.g., a
       resource allocation registry or an ISP.

  "BGPSEC router key rollover as an alternative to beaconing", Roque
  Gagliano, Keyur Patel, Brian Weis, 15-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-rollover-02.txt>

    BGPSEC will need to address the impact from regular and emergency
       rollover processes for the BGPSEC End-Entity (EE) certificates that
       will be performed by Certificate Authorities (CAs) participating at
       the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  This document
       provides general recommendations for that process and specifies how
       this process is used to control BGPSEC's window of exposure to replay
       attacks.

  "BGPSec Considerations for AS Migration", Wesley George, Sandra Murphy,
  1-Feb-13, <draft-george-sidr-as-migration-01.txt>

    This draft discusses considerations and methods for supporting and
       securing a common method for AS-Migration within the BGPSec protocol.

  "Responsible Grandparenting in the RPKI", Randy Bush, 10-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-rpki-grandparenting-01.txt>

    There are circumstances in RPKI operation where a resource holder's
       parent may not be able to, or may not choose to, facilitate full and
       proper registration of the holder's data.  As in real life, the
       holder may form a relationship with their grandparent who is willing
       to aid the grandchild.  This document describes simple procedures for
       doing so.

  "Policy Qualifiers in RPKI Certificates", Andrew Newton, Geoff Huston,
  9-May-13, <draft-ietf-sidr-policy-qualifiers-00.txt>

    This document updates RFC 6487 by clarifying the inclusion of policy
       qualifiers in the certificate policies extension of RPKI resource
       certificates.

  "Multiple Repository Publication Points support in the Resource Public
  Key Infrastructure (RPKI)", Roque Gagliano, Terry Manderson, Carlos
  Martinez, 22-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-multiple-publication-points-00.txt>

    The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) depends on Relying
       Parties (RP) ability to access its Trust Anchors' certificate
       specified in the different "Trust Anchor Locator (TAL)" files and the
       Repository Objects located at the Certificate Authorities (CA)
       repositories hosted in its respective publication point.  This
       document updates [RFC6490] by allowing multiple URI associated to a
       single public key in a TAL file and introduces the concept of
       multiple repository publication point operators for every CA in the
       RPKI.  This document provides also recommendation for the RP behavior
       when analyzing signed objects that include multiple publications
       points.

SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (simple)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

  "Multi-party Chat Using the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)", Aki
  Niemi, Miguel Garcia, Geir Sandbakken, 13-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-simple-chat-18.txt>

    The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) defines a mechanism for
       sending instant messages within a peer-to-peer session, negotiated
       using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Session
       Description Protocol (SDP).  This document defines the necessary
       tools for establishing multi-party chat sessions, or chat rooms,
       using MSRP.

Session Initiation Protocol Core (sipcore)
------------------------------------------

  "An Extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Request
  History Information", Mary Barnes, Francois Audet, Shida Schubert, Hans
  van Elburg, Christer Holmberg, 11-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-sipcore-rfc4244bis-11.txt>

    This document defines a standard mechanism for capturing the history
       information associated with a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
       request.  This capability enables many enhanced services by providing
       the information as to how and why a SIP request arrives at a specific
       application or user.  This document defines an optional SIP header
       field, History-Info, for capturing the history information in
       requests.  The document also defines SIP header field parameters for
       the History-Info and Contact header fields to tag the method by which
       the target of a request is determined.  In addition, this
       specification defines a value for the Privacy header field that
       directs the anonymization of values in the History-Info header field.
       This document obsoletes RFC 4244.

  "The WebSocket Protocol as a Transport for the Session Initiation
  Protocol (SIP)", Inaki Castillo, Jose Millan, Victor Pascual, 12-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-sipcore-sip-websocket-09.txt>

    The WebSocket protocol enables two-way realtime communication between
       clients and servers in web-based applications.  This document
       specifies a WebSocket sub-protocol as a reliable transport mechanism
       between SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) entities to enable usage of
       SIP in web-oriented deployments.  This document normatively updates
       RFC 3261.

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) History-Info Header Call Flow
  Examples", Mary Barnes, Francois Audet, Shida Schubert, Hans van Elburg,
  Christer Holmberg, 19-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-sipcore-rfc4244bis-callflows-03.txt>

    This document describes use cases and documents call flows which
    require the History-Info header field to capture the Request-URIs as
    a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Request is retargeted.  The use
    cases are described along with the corresponding call flow diagrams
    and messaging details.

SIP Recording (siprec)
----------------------

  "An Architecture for Media Recording using the Session Initiation
  Protocol", Andrew Hutton, Leon Portman, Rajnish Jain, Ken Rehor,
  23-May-13, <draft-ietf-siprec-architecture-08.txt>

    Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
       environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
       these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
       compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
       is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
       recording device.  This document describes architectures for
       deploying session recording solutions in an environment which is
       based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Recording Metadata", Ram R,
  Parthasarathi Ravindran, Paul Kyzivat, 27-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-siprec-metadata-12.txt>

    Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
       environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
       these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
       compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
       is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
       recording device.  This document describes the metadata model as
       viewed by Session Recording Server(SRS) and the Recording metadata
       format.

  "Session Recording Protocol", Leon Portman, Henry Lum, Charles Eckel,
  Alan Johnston, Andrew Hutton, 17-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-siprec-protocol-10.txt>

    This document specifies the use of the Session Initiation Protocol
       (SIP), the Session Description Protocol (SDP), and the Real Time
       Protocol (RTP) for delivering real-time media and metadata from a
       Communication Session (CS) to a recording device.  The Session
       Recording Protocol specifies the use of SIP, SDP, and RTP to
       establish a Recording Session (RS) between the Session Recording
       Client (SRC), which is on the path of the CS, and a Session Recording
       Server (SRS) at the recording device.

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Recording Call Flows", Ram R,
  Parthasarathi Ravindran, Paul Kyzivat, 25-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-siprec-callflows-00.txt>

    Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
       environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
       these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
       compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
       is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
       recording device.  This document lists call flows that has snapshot
       of metadata sent from SRC to SRS, the metadata format for which is
       described in [I-D.ietf-siprec-metadata] .  This is purely an
       informational document that is written to support the model defined
       in the metadata draft.

SIP Overload Control (soc)
--------------------------

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control", Vijay Gurbani,
  Volker Hilt, Henning Schulzrinne, 23-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-soc-overload-control-13.txt>

    Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when
       SIP servers have insufficient resources to handle all SIP messages
       they receive.  Even though the SIP protocol provides a limited
       overload control mechanism through its 503 (Service Unavailable)
       response code, SIP servers are still vulnerable to overload.  This
       document defines the behaviour of SIP servers involved in overload
       control, and in addition, it specifies a loss-based overload scheme
       for SIP.

  "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Load Control Event Package",
  Charles Shen, Henning Schulzrinne, Arata Koike, 14-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-soc-load-control-event-package-08.txt>

    We define a load control event package for the Session Initiation
       Protocol (SIP).  It allows SIP entities to distribute load filtering
       policies to other SIP entities in the network.  The load filtering
       policies contain rules to throttle calls based on their source or
       destination domain, telephone number prefix or for a specific user.
       The mechanism helps to prevent signaling overload and complements
       feedback-based SIP overload control efforts.

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Rate Control", Eric Noel, Philip
  Williams, 8-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-soc-overload-rate-control-04.txt>

    The prevalent use of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] in
       Next Generation Networks necessitates that SIP networks provide
       adequate control mechanisms to maintain transaction throughput by
       preventing congestion collapse during traffic overloads. Already
       [draft-ietf-soc-overload-control-12] proposes a loss-based solution
       to remedy known vulnerabilities of the [RFC3261] SIP 503 (service
       unavailable) overload control mechanism. This document proposes a
       rate-based control solution to complement the loss-based control
       defined in [draft-ietf-soc-overload-control-12].

Softwires (softwire)
--------------------

  "Definitions of Managed Objects for 6rd", Lei Cai, Jacni Qin, Shishio
  Tsuchiya, 16-May-13, <draft-cai-softwire-6rd-mib-05.txt>

    This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
       (MIB) for use with network management protocols.  In particular, it
       defines objects for managing 6rd devices.

  "Public IPv4 over IPv6 Access Network", Yong Cui, Jianping Wu, Peng Wu,
  Olivier Vautrin, Yiu Lee, 9-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-public-4over6-09.txt>

    When the service provider networks are upgraded to IPv6, end users
       will continue to demand IPv4 connectivity.  This document describes a
       mechanism for hosts or customer networks in IPv6 access network to
       build bidirectional IPv4 communication with the IPv4 Internet.  The
       mechanism follows the hub and spokes softwire model, and uses IPv4-
       over-IPv6 tunnel as basic method to traverse IPv6 network.  The bi-
       directionality of this IPv4 communication is achieved by explicitly
       allocating public IPv4 addresses to end users, as well as maintaining
       IPv4-IPv6 address binding on the border relay.  This mechanism
       features the allocation of full IPv4 address over IPv6 network, and
       has been used in production for high-end IPv4 users, IPv6 transition
       of ICPs, etc.

  "Motivations for Carrier-side Stateless IPv4 over IPv6 Migration
  Solutions", Mohamed Boucadair, Satoru Matsushima, Yiu Lee, Olaf Bonness,
  Isabel Borges, Gang Chen, 13-Nov-12,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation-05.txt>

    IPv4 service continuity is one of the most pressing problems that
       must be resolved by Service Providers during the IPv6 transition
       period - especially after the exhaustion of the public IPv4 address
       space.  Current standardization effort that addresses IPv4 service
       continuity focuses on stateful mechanisms.  This document elaborates
       on the motivations for the need to undertake a companion effort to
       specify stateless IPv4 over IPv6 approaches.

  "Delivery of IPv4 Multicast Services to IPv4 Clients over an IPv6
  Multicast Network", Jacni Qin, Mohamed Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet,
  Yiu Lee, Qian Wang, 14-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast-05.txt>

    This document specifies a solution for the delivery of IPv4 multicast
       services to IPv4 clients over an IPv6 multicast network.  The
       solution relies upon a stateless IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation scheme
       and uses the IPv6 multicast distribution tree to deliver IPv4
       multicast traffic.  The solution is particularly useful for the
       delivery of multicast service offerings to DS-Lite serviced
       customers.

  "Softwire Mesh Multicast", Mingwei Xu, Yong Cui, Jianping Wu, Shu Yang,
  Chris Metz, Greg Shepherd, 12-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-mesh-multicast-04.txt>

    The Internet needs to support IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  Both address
       families and their attendant protocol suites support multicast of the
       single-source and any-source varieties.  As part of the transition to
       IPv6, there will be scenarios where a backbone network running one IP
       address family internally (referred to as internal IP or I-IP) will
       provide transit services to attached client networks running another
       IP address family (referred to as external IP or E-IP).  It is
       expected that the I-IP backbone will offer unicast and multicast
       transit services to the client E-IP networks.
    
       Softwire Mesh is a solution to E-IP unicast and multicast support
       across an I-IP backbone.  This document describes the mechanisms for
       supporting Internet-style multicast across a set of E-IP and I-IP
       networks supporting softwire mesh.

  "RADIUS Attribute for MAP", Sheng Jiang, Yu Fu, Bing Liu, Peter Deacon,
  26-Apr-13, <draft-jiang-softwire-map-radius-04.txt>

    Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) is a stateless mechanism for
       running IPv4 over IPv6-only infrastructure. It provides both IPv4 and
       IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-
       existing period. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
       (DHCPv6) MAP options has been defined to configure MAP Customer Edge
       (CE). However, in many networks, the configuration information may be
       stored in Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers
       while user configuration is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway
       (BNG) through DHCPv6 protocol. This document defines a Remote
       Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries
       MAP configuration information from AAA server to BNG. The MAP RADIUS
       attribute are designed following the simplify principle. It provides
       just enough information to form the correspondent DHCPv6 MAP option.

  "Definitions of Managed Objects for MAP-E", Yu Fu, Sheng Jiang, Bing
  Liu, Jiang Dong, Peng Wu, 14-May-13, <draft-fu-softwire-map-mib-05.txt>

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
       for using with network management protocols in the Internet
       community. In particular, it defines managed objects for MAP
       encapsulation mode.

  "DHCPv6 Option for IPv4-Embedded Multicast and Unicast IPv6 Prefixes",
  Mohamed Boucadair, Jacni Qin, Tina Tsou, Xiaohong Deng, 14-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-multicast-prefix-option-04.txt>

    This document defines Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6
       (DHCPv6) Option for multicast transition solutions, aiming to convey
       the IPv6 prefixes to be used to build unicast and multicast
       IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses.

  "IPv4 Residual Deployment via IPv6 - a Stateless Solution (4rd)", Remi
  Despres, Sheng Jiang, Reinaldo Penno, Yiu Lee, Gang Chen, Maoke Chen,
  25-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-softwire-4rd-05.txt>

    The 4rd automatic tunneling mechanism makes IPv4 Residual Deployment
       possible via IPv6 networks without maintaining for this per-customer
       states in 4rd-capable nodes (reverse of the IPv6 Rapid Deployment of
       6rd).  To cope with the IPv4 address shortage, customer sites can be
       assigned shared public IPv4 addresses with restricted port sets. 4rd
       can also support the scenarios that customer sites are assigned full
       public IPv4 addresses or a set of public IPv4 addresses.

  "Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP)", Ole Troan,
  Wojciech Dec, Xing Li, Congxiao Bao, Satoru Matsushima, Tetsuya
  Murakami, Tom Taylor, 29-May-13, <draft-ietf-softwire-map-07.txt>

    This document describes a mechanism for transporting IPv4 packets
       across an IPv6 network using IP encapsulation, and a generic
       mechanism for mapping between IPv6 addresses and IPv4 addresses and
       transport layer ports.

  "Softwire Mesh Management Information Base (MIB)", Yong Cui, Jiang Dong,
  Peng Wu, Mingwei Xu, 10-Mar-13, <draft-ietf-softwire-mesh-mib-03.txt>

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
       for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
       In particular it defines objects for managing softwire mesh
       [RFC5565].

  "DS-Lite Management Information Base (MIB)", Yu Fu, Sheng Jiang, Jiang
  Dong, Yuchi Chen, 25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-mib-02.txt>

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
    using with network management protocols in the Internet community. In
    particular, it defines managed objects for DS-Lite.

  "DHCPv6 Options for Mapping of Address and Port", Tomek Mrugalski, Ole
  Troan, Wojciech Dec, Congxiao Bao,  leaf.yeh.sdo@gmail.com, Xiaohong
  Deng, 25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-softwire-map-dhcp-03.txt>

    This document specifies DHCPv6 options for the provisioning of
       Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) Customer Edge (CE) devices, based
       on the MAP paramaters defined in [I-D.ietf-softwire-map].

  "Mapping of Address and Port using Translation (MAP-T)", Xing Li,
  Congxiao Bao, Wojciech Dec, Ole Troan, Satoru Matsushima, Tetsuya
  Murakami, 18-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-softwire-map-t-01.txt>

    This document specifies the "Mapping of Address and Port" double
       stateless NAT64 translation based solution (MAP-T) for providing
       shared or uniquely addressed IPv4 device connectivity to and across
       an IPv6 domain.

  "Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) - Deployment Considerations", Qiong
  Sun, Maoke Chen, Gang Chen, Tina Tsou, Simon Perreault, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-map-deployment-01.txt>

    This document describes when and how an operator uses the technique
       of Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) for the IPv4 residual deployment
       in the IPv6-dominant domain.

  "Unified IPv4-in-IPv6 Softwire CPE", Mohamed Boucadair, Ian Farrer,
  Simon Perreault, Senthil Sivakumar, 30-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-unified-cpe-01.txt>

    Transporting IPv4 packets encapsulated in IPv6 is a common solution
       to the problem of IPv4 service continuity over IPv6-only provider
       networks.  A number of differing functional approaches have been
       developed for this, each having their own specific characteristics.
       As these approaches share a similar functional architecture and use
       the same data plane mechanisms, this memo describes a specification
       whereby a single CPE can interwork with all of the standardized and
       proposed approaches to providing encapsulated IPv4 in IPv6 services.

  "Lightweight 4over6: An Extension to the DS-Lite Architecture", Yong
  Cui, Qiong Sun, Mohamed Boucadair, Tina Tsou, Yiu Lee, Ian Farrer,
  10-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-softwire-lw4over6-00.txt>

    DS-Lite [RFC6333] describes an architecture for transporting IPv4
       packets over an IPv6 network.  This document specifies an extension
       to DS-Lite called Lightweight 4over6 which moves the Network Address
       Translation function from the DS-Lite AFTR to the B4, removing the
       requirement for a Carrier Grade NAT function in the AFTR.  This
       reduces the amount of centralized state that must be held to a per-
       subscriber level.  In order to delegate the NAPT function and make
       IPv4 Address sharing possible, port-restricted IPv4 addresses are
       allocated to the B4s.

SPF Update (spfbis)
-------------------

  "Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email,
  Version 1", D. Kitterman, 23-May-13, <draft-ietf-spfbis-4408bis-15.txt>

    Email on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways.  In
       particular, existing protocols place no restriction on what a sending
       host can use as the "MAIL FROM" of a message or the domain given on
       the SMTP HELO/EHLO commands.  This document describes version 1 of
       the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol, whereby a ADMDs
       (ADministrative Management Domains) can explicitly authorize the
       hosts that are allowed to use its domain names, and a receiving host
       can check such authorization.
    
       This document obsoletes RFC4408.

STORage Maintenance (storm)
---------------------------

  "iSCSI Extensions for RDMA Specification", Mike Ko, Alexander Nezhinsky,
  6-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-storm-iser-14.txt>

    iSCSI Extensions for Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) provides the
       RDMA data transfer capability to iSCSI by layering iSCSI on top of
       an RDMA-Capable Protocol.  An RDMA-Capable Protocol provides RDMA
       Read and Write services, which enable data to be transferred
       directly into SCSI I/O Buffers without intermediate data copies.
       This document describes the extensions to the iSCSI protocol to
       support RDMA services as provided by an RDMA-Capable Protocol.
    
       This document obsoletes RFC 5046.

  "iSCSI Protocol (Consolidated)", Mallikarjun Chadalapaka, Julian Satran,
  Kalman Meth, David Black, 15-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-storm-iscsi-cons-08.txt,.pdf>

    This document describes a transport protocol for SCSI that works
    on top of TCP. The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with
    the standardized SCSI Architecture Model (SAM-2). RFC 3720
    defined the original iSCSI protocol. RFC 3721 discusses iSCSI
    Naming examples and discovery techniques. Subsequently, RFC 3980
    added an additional naming format to iSCSI protocol. RFC 4850
    followed up by adding a new public extension key to iSCSI. RFC
    5048 offered a number of clarifications and a few improvements and
    corrections to the original iSCSI protocol.
    
    This document obsoletes RFCs 3720, 3980, 4850 and 5048 by
    consolidating them into a single document and making additional
    updates to the consolidated specification. This document also
    updates RFC 3721 and RFC 3723. The text in this document thus
    supersedes the text in all the noted RFCs wherever there is a
    difference in semantics.
    
    Note: This version of the draft does not yet incorporate planned
    resolutions to some Last Call comments regarding Kerberos and
    IPsec-related security considerations.

  "RDMA Protocol Extensions", Hemal Shah, Felix Marti, Wael Noureddine,
  Asgeir Eiriksson, Robert Sharp, 9-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-storm-rdmap-ext-04.txt,.pdf>

    This document specifies extensions to the IETF Remote Direct Memory
       Access Protocol (RDMAP [RFC5040]). RDMAP provides read and write
       services directly to applications and enables data to be transferred
       directly into Upper Layer Protocol (ULP) Buffers without
       intermediate data copies. The extensions specified in this document
       provide the following capabilities and/or improvements: Atomic
       Operations and Immediate Data.

  "Definitions of Managed Objects for Internet Small Computer System
  Interface (iSCSI)", Mark Bakke, Prakash Venkatesen, 2-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-storm-iscsimib-04.txt>

    This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
       (MIB) for use with network management protocols. In particular, it
       defines objects for managing a client using the Internet Small
       Computer System Interface (iSCSI) protocol (SCSI over TCP).
    
       This document obsoletes RFC4544.

  "IP Storage: IPsec Requirements Update for IPsec v3", David Black, Paul
  Koning, 7-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-storm-ipsec-ips-update-01.txt>

    RFC 3723 includes requirements for IPsec usage with IP Storage
    protocols (e.g., iSCSI) based on IPsec v2 (RFC 2401 and related
    RFCs).  This document updates those requirements to IPsec v3 (RFC
    4301 and related RFCs) and updates implementation requirements to
    reflect developments in cryptography since RFC 3723 was published.

Sip Traversal Required for Applications to Work (straw)
-------------------------------------------------------

  "A Taxonomy of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Back-to-Back User
  Agents", Hadriel Kaplan, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-straw-b2bua-taxonomy-02.txt>

    In many SIP deployments, SIP entities exist in the SIP signaling path
       between the originating UAC and final terminating UAS, which go
       beyond the definition of a Proxy, performing functions not defined in
       standards-track RFCs.  The only term for such devices provided in
       [RFC3261] is for a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), which is defined
       as the logical concatenation of a User Agent Server (UAS) and User
       Agent Client (UAC).
    
       There are numerous types of SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs),
       performing different roles in different ways.  For Example IP-PBXs,
       SBCs and Application Servers.  This document identifies several
       common B2BUA roles, in order to provide taxonomy other documents can
       use and reference.

  "Loop Detection Mechanisms for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
  Back-to- Back User Agents (B2BUAs)", Hadriel Kaplan, Victor Pascual,
  18-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-straw-b2bua-loop-detection-00.txt>

    SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) can cause unending SIP request
       routing loops because, as User Agent Clients, they can generate SIP
       requests with new Max-Forwards values.  This document discusses the
       difficulties associated with loop detection for B2BUAs, and
       requirements for them to prevent infinite loops.

Sunsetting IPv4 (sunset4)
-------------------------

  "Gap Analysis for IPv4 Sunset", Jean-Philippe Dionne, Simon Perreault,
  Tina Tsou, Cathy Zhou, 22-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-sunset4-gapanalysis-02.txt>

    Sunsetting IPv4 refers to the process of turning off IPv4
       definitively.  It can be seen as the final phase of the migration to
       IPv6.  This memo enumerates difficulties arising when sunsetting
       IPv4, and identifies the gaps requiring additional work.

TCP Maintenance and Minor Extensions (tcpm)
-------------------------------------------

  "TCP Extensions for High Performance", David Borman, Robert Braden, Van
  Jacobson, Richard Scheffenegger, 23-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-tcpm-1323bis-14.txt>

    This document specifies a set of TCP extensions to improve
       performance over paths with a large bandwidth * delay product and to
       provide reliable operation over very high-speed paths.  It defines
       TCP options for scaled windows and timestamps.  The timestamps are
       used for two distinct mechanisms, RTTM (Round Trip Time Measurement)
       and PAWS (Protection Against Wrapped Sequences).
    
       This document updates and obsoletes RFC 1323.

  "Shared Use of Experimental TCP Options", Joseph Touch, 4-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-tcpm-experimental-options-06.txt>

    This document describes how the experimental TCP option codepoints
       can concurrently support multiple TCP extensions, even within the
       same connection. It uses a new IANA TCP experiment identifier, and
       is also robust to experiments that are not registered and those that
       do not use this sharing mechanism. It is recommended for all new TCP
       options that use these codepoints.

  "TCP Fast Open", Yuchung Cheng, Jerry Chu, Sivasankar Radhakrishnan,
  Arvind Jain, 25-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-tcpm-fastopen-03.txt>

    TCP Fast Open (TFO) allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK
       packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial
       connection handshake, thus saving up to one full round trip time
       (RTT) compared to standard TCP which requires a three-way handshake
       (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged.
    
    Terminology

  "Problem Statement and Requirements for a More Accurate ECN Feedback",
  Mirja Kuehlewind, Richard Scheffenegger, 11-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-tcpm-accecn-reqs-00.txt>

    Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an IP/TCP mechanism where
    network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to
    indicate congestion to the end-points.  An ECN-capable receiver will
    feedback this information to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP in
    such a way that only one feedback signal can be transmitted per
    Round-Trip Time (RTT).  Recently, new TCP mechanisms like ConEx or
    DCTCP need more accurate ECN feedback information in the case where
    more than one marking is received in one RTT.  This documents
    specifies requirement for different ECN feedback scheme in the TCP
    header to provide more than one feedback signal per RTT.

  "Updating TCP to support Rate-Limited Traffic", Gorry Fairhurst, Arjuna
  Sathiaseelan, Raffaello Secchi, 19-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-tcpm-newcwv-01.txt>

    This document proposes an update to RFC 5681 to address issues that
       arise when TCP is used to support traffic that exhibits periods where
       the sending rate is limited by the application rather than the
       congestion window.  It updates TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart
       quickly following either an idle or rate-limited interval.  This
       method is expected to benefit applications that send rate-limited
       traffic using TCP, while also providing an appropriate response if
       congestion is experienced.
    
       It also evaluates the Experimental specification of TCP Congestion
       Window Validation, CWV, defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that RFC
       2861 sought to address important issues, but failed to deliver a
       widely used solution.  This document therefore recommends that the
       status of RFC 2861 is moved from Experimental to Historic, and that
       it is replaced by the current specification.
    
       NOTE: The standards status of this WG document is under review for
       consideration as either Experimental (EXP) or Proposed Standard (PS).
       This decision will be made later as the document is finalised.

  "TCP and SCTP RTO Restart", Per Hurtig, Anna Brunstrom, Andreas Petlund,
  Michael Welzl, 18-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-tcpm-rtorestart-00.txt>

    This document describes a modified algorithm for managing the TCP and
       SCTP retransmission timers that provides faster loss recovery when a
       connection's amount of outstanding data is small.  The modification
       allows the transport to restart its retransmission timer more
       aggressively in situations where fast retransmit cannot be used.
       This enables faster loss detection and recovery for connections that
       are short-lived or application-limited.

Timing over IP Connection and Transfer of Clock (tictoc)
--------------------------------------------------------

  "Transporting Timing messages over MPLS Networks", Shahram Davari, Amit
  Oren, Manav Bhatia, Peter Roberts, Laurent Montini, 14-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-tictoc-1588overmpls-05.txt>

    This document defines the method for transporting Timing messages
       such as PTP and NTP over an MPLS network.  The method allows for the
       easy identification of these PDUs at the port level to allow for port
       level processing of these PDUs in both LERs and LSRs.
    
       The basic idea is to transport Timing messages inside dedicated MPLS
       LSPs.  These LSPs only carry Timing messages and possibly Control and
       Management packets, but they do not carry customer traffic.
    
       Two methods for transporting Timing messages over MPLS are defined.
       The first method is to transport Timing messages directly over the
       dedicated MPLS LSP via UDP/IP encapsulation, which is suitable for
       MPLS networks.  The second method is to transport Timing messages
       inside a PW via Ethernet encapsulation.

  "Precision Time Protocol Version 2 (PTPv2) Management Information Base",
  Vinay Shankarkumar, Laurent Montini, Tim Frost, Greg Dowd, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-tictoc-ptp-mib-05.txt,.pdf>

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
       for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
       In particular, it defines objects for managing networks using
       Precision Time Protocol, specified in [IEEE 1588-2008].
    
       This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant
       to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
       definitions.

  "Security Requirements of Time Protocols in Packet Switched Networks",
  Tal Mizrahi, 25-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-tictoc-security-requirements-05.txt>

    As time and frequency distribution protocols are becoming
       increasingly common and widely deployed, concern about their exposure
       to various security threats is increasing. This document defines a
       set of security requirements for time protocols, focusing on the
       Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
       This document also discusses the security impacts of time protocol
       practices, the performance implications of external security
       practices on time protocols and the dependencies between other
       security services and time synchronization.

Transport Layer Security (tls)
------------------------------

  "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Cached Information Extension", Stefan
  Santesson, Hannes Tschofenig, 28-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-tls-cached-info-14.txt>

    Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshakes often include fairly static
       information, such as the server certificate and a list of trusted
       Certification Authorities (CAs).  This information can be of
       considerable size, particularly if the server certificate is bundled
       with a complete certificate path (including all intermediary
       certificates up to the trust anchor public key).
    
       This document defines an extension that omits the exchange of already
       available information.  The TLS client informs a server of cached
       information, for example from a previous TLS handshake, allowing the
       server to omit the already available information.

  "Out-of-Band Public Key Validation for Transport Layer Security (TLS)",
  Paul Wouters, Hannes Tschofenig, John Gilmore, Samuel Weiler, Tero
  Kivinen, 14-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-tls-oob-pubkey-07.txt>

    This document specifies a new certificate type for exchanging raw
       public keys in Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport
       Layer Security (DTLS) for use with out-of-band public key validation.
       Currently, TLS authentication can only occur via X.509-based Public
       Key Infrastructure (PKI) or OpenPGP certificates.  By specifying a
       minimum resource for raw public key exchange, implementations can use
       alternative public key validation methods.
    
       One such alternative public key valiation method is offered by the
       DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) together with DNS
       Security.  Another alternative is to utilize pre-configured keys, as
       is the case with sensors and other embedded devices.  The usage of
       raw public keys, instead of X.509-based certificates, leads to a
       smaller code footprint.
    
       This document introduces the support for raw public keys in TLS.

  "Secure Password Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)", Dan
  Harkins, Dave Halasz, 15-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-tls-pwd-00.txt>

    This memo defines several new ciphersuites for the Transport Layer
       Security (TLS) protocol to support certificate-less, secure
       authentication using only a simple, low-entropy, password.  The
       ciphersuites are all based on an authentication and key exchange
       protocol that is resistant to off-line dictionary attack.

  "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Application Layer Protocol Negotiation
  Extension", Stephan Friedl, Andrey Popov, Adam Langley, Stephan Emile,
  25-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-tls-applayerprotoneg-01.txt>

    This document describes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension
       for application layer protocol negotiation within the TLS handshake.
       For instances in which the TLS connection is established over a well
       known TCP/IP port not associated with the desired application layer
       protocol, this extension allows the application layer to negotiate
       which protocol will be used within the TLS session.

Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (trill)
----------------------------------------------------

  "TRILL: Campus VLAN and Priority Regions", Radia Perlman, Anil
  Rijhsinghani, Donald Eastlake, Ayan Banerjee, Dinesh Dutt, 1-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-vlan-mapping-08.txt>

    Within a TRILL campus, the VLAN and priority of TRILL encapsulated
       frames is preserved. However, in some cases it may be desired that
       data VLAN and/or priority be mapped at the boundary between regions
       of such a campus. This document describes an optional RBridge feature
       to provide this function.

  "TRILL: RBridge Channel Support", Donald Eastlake, Vishwas Manral, Li
  Yizhou, Sam Aldrin, David Ward, 14-Jul-12,
  <draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-channel-08.txt>

    This document specifies a general channel mechanism for sending
       messages, such as BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) messages,
       between RBridges (Routing Bridges) and between RBridges and end
       stations in an RBridge campus through extensions to the TRILL
       (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol.

  "TRILL (Transparent Interconnetion of Lots of Links): Bidirectional
  Forwarding Detection (BFD) Support", Vishwas Manral, Donald Eastlake,
  David Ward, Ayan Banerjee, 16-Jul-12,
  <draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-bfd-07.txt>

    This document specifies use of the BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding
       Detection) protocol in RBridge campuses based on the Rbridge Channel
       extension to the the TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of
       Links) protocol.
    
       BFD is a widely deployed OAM (Operations, Administration, and
       Maintenance) mechanism in IP and MPLS (Multi Protocol Label
       Switching) networks, using UDP and ACH (Associated Channel Header)
       encapsulation respectively.  This document specifies the BFD
       encapsulation over TRILL.

  "TRILL: Header Extension", Donald Eastlake, Anoop Ghanwani, Vishwas
  Manral, Li Yizhou, Caitlin Bestler, 20-Jun-12,
  <draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-extension-05.txt>

    The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) base
       protocol specifies minimal hooks to safely support TRILL Header
       extensions. This document specifies an initial extension providing
       additional flag bits and specifies some of those bits. It updates RFC
       6325.

  "TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links): Fine-Grained
  Labeling", Donald Eastlake, Mingui Zhang, Puneet Agarwal, Radia Perlman,
  Dinesh Dutt, 17-May-13, <draft-ietf-trill-fine-labeling-07.txt>

    The IETF has standardized TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots
       of Links), a protocol for least cost transparent frame routing in
       multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and link technologies,
       using link-state routing and a hop count. The TRILL base protocol
       standard supports labeling of TRILL data with up to 4K IDs. However,
       there are applications that require a larger number of labels
       providing configurable isolation of data. This document updates RFC
       6325 by specifying optional extensions to the TRILL base protocol to
       safely accomplish this. These extensions, called fine grained
       labeling, are primarily intended for use in large Data Centers, those
       with >4K users requiring configurable data isolation from each other.

  "TRILL: Clarifications, Corrections, and Updates", Donald Eastlake,
  Mingui Zhang, Anoop Ghanwani, Vishwas Manral, Ayan Banerjee, 30-Jul-12,
  <draft-ietf-trill-clear-correct-06.txt>

    The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
       protocol provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without
       configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology and link
       technology, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops,
       and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic.
       TRILL accomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate System to
       Intermediate System) link state routing and by encapsulating traffic
       using a header that includes a hop count. Since the TRILL base
       protocol was approved in March 2010, active development of TRILL has
       revealed errata in the original RFC 6325 and some cases that could
       use clarifications or updates.
    
       RFC 6327 and RFC 6439 provide clarifications and updates with respect
       to Adjacency and Appointed Forwarders. This document provides other
       known clarifications, corrections, and updates to RFC 6325, RFC 6327,
       and RFC 6439.

  "TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links): ESADI (End
  Station Address Distribution Information) Protocol", ZTE Corporation,
  fangwei hu, Radia Perlman, Donald Eastlake, Olen Stokes, 21-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-trill-esadi-02.txt>

    The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
       protocol provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without
       configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and
       link technologies.  TRILL supports multi-pathing of both unicast and
       multicast traffic.  Devices that implement the TRILL protocol are
       called RBridges (Routing Bridges) or TRILL Switches.
    
       ESADI (End Station Address Distribution Information) is an optional
       protocol by which a TRILL switch can communicate, in a Data Label
       (VLAN or Fine Grained Label) scoped way, end station addresses and
       other information to TRILL switches pariticipating in ESADI for the
       relevant Data Label.  This document updates RFC 6325, specifically
       the documentation of the ESADI protocol.

  "TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links): Edge Directory
  Assistance Framework", Linda Dunbar, Donald Eastlake, Radia Perlman,
  Igor Gashinsky, 26-Apr-13, <draft-ietf-trill-directory-framework-05.txt>

    Edge TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) switches
       currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses and their egress
       TRILL switch by observing the data packets they ingress or egress or
       by the TRILL ESADI (End Station Address Distribution Information)
       protocol. When an ingress TRILL switch receives a data frame whose
       destination address (MAC&VLAN) that switch does not know, the data
       frame is flooded within the frame's VLAN across the TRILL campus.
    
       This document describes the framework for using directory services to
       assist edge RBridges in reducing multi-destination frames,
       particularly unknown unicast frames flooding, and ARP/ND, thus
       improving TRILL network scalability.

  "TRILL Fault Management", Tissa Senevirathne, Norman Finn, Samer Salam,
  Deepak Kumar, Donald Eastlake, Sam Aldrin, Li Yizhou, 28-May-13,
  <draft-tissa-trill-oam-fm-02.txt>

    TRILL OAM Fault Management specification is presented in this
       document. Methods in this document follow the IEEE 802.1 CFM
       framework and reuse OAM tools where possible. Additional messages and
       TLVs are defined for TRILL specific applications or where a different
       set of information is required other than IEEE 802.1 CFM.

  "TRILL OAM Framework", Samer Salam, Tissa Senevirathne, Sam Aldrin,
  Donald Eastlake, 23-May-13, <draft-ietf-trill-oam-framework-02.txt>

    This document specifies a reference framework for Operations,
       Administration and Maintenance (OAM) in TRILL networks. The focus of
       the document is on the fault and performance management aspects of
       TRILL OAM.

  "TRILL: Adjacency", Donald Eastlake, Radia Perlman, Anoop Ghanwani,
  Vishwas Manral, 28-Apr-13, <draft-eastlake-trill-rfc6327bis-00.txt>

    The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
       protocol supports arbitrary link technologies between TRILL switches
       including point-to-point links and multi-access LAN (Local Area
       Network) links that can have multiple TRILL switches and end stations
       attached. TRILL uses IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate
       System) routing. This document specifies the establishment,
       reporting, and termination of IS-IS adjacency between TRILL switches,
       also known as RBridges. It also concerns four other link-local
       aspects of TRILL: Designated RBridge (DRB) selection, MTU (Maximum
       Transmission Unit) testing, pseudonode creation, and BFD (Bi-
       Directional Forwarding Detection) session bootstrapping in connection
       with adjacency. State diagrams are included where appropriate.  This
       document obsoletes RFC 6327 and updates RFC 6325.

  "TWAMP Burst Rate Measurement Features", Al Morton, Len Ciavattone,
  21-Feb-13, <draft-morton-ippm-twamp-rate-03.txt>

    This memo describes two rate-measurement features for the core
       specification of TWAMP - the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol: an
       optional capability where the reflector host responds with a
       controlled burst of test-session packets (instead of a single
       packet), and an optional test mode that requires the responder to
       measure a burst of test packets and communicate the results in
       truncated packet(s).  Both features add the ability to control packet
       size in the tested direction, enabling asymmetrical packet size
       testing.  This draft defines the modes in terms of traditional UDP
       test packets.  Use TCP transport instead of UDP may be desirable, but
       is deferred for future work.

  "New Performance Metrics Composition Framework for Multiparty Services",
  Tiziano Ionta, 4-Jun-13,
  <draft-ionta-new-multiparty-metrics-framework-02.txt>

    One of the best chances for a Service Provider to face the complex
    growth of IP Services, and their challenging requirements/SLAs along
    the Core network, is to enrich the current Performance metrics - mainly
    derived from a "Network-Oriented point of view", and therefore a
    general perspective, not focused on specific services - with some more
    Performance factors, so to include a "Service-Oriented point of view",
    more centred on the particular kind of service, with its own
    characteristics in terms of protocol, application, manageability, and
    so on.
    Almost nothing about this new approach has been standardized yet for
    the core network.
    To achieve the above goal, and starting from the one-to-group
    performance metrics outlined in RFC 5644 [RFC5644], a new metrics
    composition/aggregation framework is proposed in this memo, where the
    main focus is on multiparty communications (e.g. video providers,
    online biding, online stock market, etc.).
    Finally this memo is tuned to RFC 6390 [RFC6390] in terms of scopes,
    framework concepts, and need to widen the current performance metrics
    depending on the application, service etc.

  "TCP option for transparent Middlebox negotiation", Andrew Knutsen,
  Anantha Ramaiah, Arivu Ramasamy, 1-Feb-13,
  <draft-ananth-middisc-tcpopt-02.txt>

    This document describes a TCP option for use by middleboxes to
       facilitate transparent detection of other middleboxes along the path
       of the TCP connection during the connection initiation phase.  The
       option has no effect if an appropriate middlebox is not present on
       the path.

  "Spatial Aggregation Metrics for Multipary Services", Tiziano Ionta,
  4-Jun-13, <draft-ionta-spatial-metrics-multiparty-services-02.txt>

    One of the best chances for a Service Provider to face the complex
    growth of IP Services, and their challenging requirements/SLAs along
    the Core network, is to enrich the current Performance metrics - mainly
    derived from a Network-oriented point of view, and therefore a general
    perspective, not focused on specific services - with some more
    Performance factors, so to include a Service-oriented point of view,
    more centred on the particular kind of service, with its own
    characteristics in terms of protocol, application, manageability,
    and so on.
    To achieve the above goal, and starting from the one-to-group
    performance metrics outlined in RFC 5644 [RFC5644], an effort to a
    deeper analysis and definition of spatial aggregation metrics (as a
    part of the framework for metric composition defined in RFC 5835
    [RFC5835])is proposed in this memo, where the main focus is on
    multiparty communications (e.g. video providers, online biding,
    online stock market, etc.).
    This memo lends itself to passive measurement as well as active
    measurement.
    Finally this memo is tuned to RFC 6390 [RFC6390] in terms of scopes,
    framework concepts, and need to widen the current performance metrics
    depending on the application, service etc.

  "Controlled Delay Active Queue Management", Kathleen Nichols, Van
  Jacobson, 25-Feb-13, <draft-nichols-tsvwg-codel-01.txt,.pdf>

    The "persistently full buffer" problem has been discussed in the
       IETF community since the early 80's [RFC896]. The IRTF's End-to-End
       Working Group called for the deployment of active queue management
       to solve the problem in 1998 [RFC2309]. Despite the awareness and
       recommendations, the "full buffer" problem has not gone away, but on
       the contrary has become worse as buffers have grown in size and
       proliferated and today's networks proved intractable for available
       AQM approaches. The overall problem is presently known as
       "bufferbloat"[TSVBB2011, BB2011] and has become increasingly
       important, particularly at the consumer edge.
       This document describes a recently developed AQM, Controlled Delay
       (CoDel) algorithm, which was designed to work in modern networking
       environments and can be deployed as a major part of the solution to
       bufferbloat [CODEL2012]. The goal of the CoDel work is to provide a
       solution with cost-effective implementation that is particularly
       well-suited to the consumer edge.

  "DiffServ interconnection classes and practice", Ruediger Geib,
  25-Feb-13, <draft-geib-tsvwg-diffserv-intercon-02.txt>

    This document proposes a limited set of interconnection QoS PHBs and
       PHB groups.  It further introduces some DiffServ deployment aspects.
       The proposals made here should be integrated into a revised version
       of RFC5127.

  "Adobe's Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol", Michael Thornburgh,
  2-May-13, <draft-thornburgh-adobe-rtmfp-07.txt>

    This memo describes the Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol (RTMFP),
       an endpoint-to-endpoint communication protocol designed to securely
       transport parallel flows of real-time video, audio, and data
       messages, as well as bulk data, over IP networks.  RTMFP has features
       making it effective for peer-to-peer (P2P) as well as client-server
       communications, even when Network Address Translators (NATs) are
       used.

Transport Area Working Group (tsvwg)
------------------------------------

  "Byte and Packet Congestion Notification", Bob Briscoe, Jukka Manner,
  23-May-13, <draft-ietf-tsvwg-byte-pkt-congest-10.txt>

    This document provides recommendations of best current practice for
       dropping or marking packets using any active queue management (AQM)
       algorithm, such as random early detection (RED), BLUE, pre-congestion
       notification (PCN), etc.  We give three strong recommendations: (1)
       packet size should be taken into account when transports read and
       respond to congestion indications, (2) packet size should not be
       taken into account when network equipment creates congestion signals
       (marking, dropping), and therefore (3) in the specific case of RED,
       the byte-mode packet drop variant that drops fewer small packets
       should not be used.  This memo updates RFC 2309 to deprecate
       deliberate preferential treatment of small packets in AQM algorithms.

  "Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Network Address Translation
  Support", Randall Stewart, Michael Tuexen, Irene Ruengeler, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-natsupp-05.txt>

    Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable
       communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to
       TCP [RFC0793].  With the widespread deployment of Network Address
       Translators (NAT), specialized code has been added to NAT for TCP
       that allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT and yet use only a
       single globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts (behind a
       NAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection.  This
       additional code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port
       Translation (NAPT).  To date, specialized code for SCTP has not yet
       been added to most NATs so that only pure NAT is available.  The end
       result of this is that only one SCTP capable host can be behind a
       NAT.
    
       This document describes the protocol extensions required for the SCTP
       endpoints to help NATs provide similar features of NAPT in the
       single-point and multi-point traversal scenario.

  "Integrated Services (IntServ) Extension to Allow Signaling of Multiple
  Traffic Specifications and Multiple Flow Specifications in RSVPv1",
  James Polk, Subha Dhesikan, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-intserv-multiple-tspec-02.txt>

    This document defines extensions to Integrated Services (IntServ)
       allowing  multiple traffic specifications and multiple flow
       specifications to be conveyed in the same Resource Reservation
       Protocol (RSVPv1) reservation message exchange. This ability helps
       optimize an agreeable bandwidth through a network between endpoints
       in a single round trip.

  "Generic Aggregation of Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) for IPv4
  And IPv6 Reservations over PCN domains", Georgios Karagiannis, Anurag
  Bhargava, 24-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-pcn-04.txt>

    This document specifies extensions to Generic Aggregated RSVP
       [RFC4860] for support of the PCN Controlled Load (CL) and Single
       Marking (SM) edge behaviors over a Diffserv cloud using Pre-
       Congestion Notification.

  "Recommendations for Transport Port Uses", Joseph Touch, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-port-use-01.txt>

    This document provides recommendations to application and service
       designers on how to use the transport protocol port number space to
       help in its preservation.

  "Quick Failover Algorithm in SCTP", Yoshifumi Nishida, Preethi
  Natarajan, Armando Caro, Paul Amer, 18-Jun-13,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-failover-01.txt>

    One of the major advantages in SCTP is supporting multi-homing
       communication.  If a multi-homed end-point has redundant network
       connections, SCTP sessions can have a good chance to survive from
       network failures by migrating inactive network to active one.
       However, if we follow the SCTP standard, there can be significant
       delay for the network migration.  During this migration period, SCTP
       cannot transmit much data to the destination.  This issue drastically
       impairs the usability of SCTP in some situations.  This memo
       describes the issue of SCTP failover mechanism and discuss its
       solutions which require minimal modification to the current standard.

  "DTLS Encapsulation of SCTP Packets for RTCWEB", Randell Jesup,
  Salvatore Loreto, Randall Stewart, Michael Tuexen, 16-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps-00.txt>

    The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport
       protocol originally defined to run on top of the network protocols
       IPv4 or IPv6.  This memo document specifies how SCTP can be used on
       top of the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol.  SCTP
       over DTLS is used by the RTCWeb protocol suite for transporting non-
       media data between browsers.

  "SACK-IMMEDIATELY Extension for the Stream Control Transmission
  Protocol", Michael Tuexen, Irene Ruengeler, Randall Stewart, 8-Apr-13,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-sack-immediately-03.txt>

    This document updates RFC 4960 by defining a method for the sender of
       a DATA chunk to indicate that the corresponding SACK chunk should be
       sent back immediately and not be delayed.  It is done by specifying a
       bit in the DATA chunk header, called the I-bit, which can get set
       either by the SCTP implementation or by the application using an SCTP
       stack.  Since unknown flags in chunk headers are ignored by SCTP
       implementations, this extension does not introduce any
       interoperability problems.

  "Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Application-ID Profiles for Voice
  and Video Streams", James Polk, Subha Dhesikan, 19-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-app-id-vv-profiles-00.txt>

    RFC 2872 defines an Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) object for
       application identifiers.  This document uses that App-ID and gives
       implementers specific guidelines for differing voice and video
       stream identifications to nodes along a reservation path, creating
       specific profiles for voice and video session identification.

Uniform Resource Names, Revised (urnbis)
----------------------------------------

  "Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace Definition Mechanisms", Peter
  Saint-Andre, Leslie Daigle, Renato Iannella, Patrick Faltstrom,
  19-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-urnbis-rfc3406bis-urn-ns-reg-05.txt>

    This document supplements the Uniform Resource Name (URN) syntax
       specification by defining the concept of a URN namespace, as well as
       mechanisms for defining and registering such namespaces.  This
       document obsoletes RFC 3406.

IPv6 Operations (v6ops)
-----------------------

  "IPv6 Multihoming without Network Address Translation", Ole Troan, David
  Miles, Satoru Matsushima, Tadahisa Okimoto, Dan Wing, 18-Mar-13,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv6-multihoming-without-ipv6nat-05.txt>

    Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) works well for conserving
       global addresses and addressing multihoming requirements, because an
       IPv4 NAPT router implements three functions: source address
       selection, next-hop resolution and optionally DNS resolution.  For
       IPv6 hosts one approach could be the use of NPTv6.  However, NAT
       should be avoided, if at all possible, to permit transparent end-to-
       end connectivity.  In this document, we analyze the use cases of
       multihoming.  We also describe functional requirements and possible
       solutions for multihoming without the use of NAT in IPv6 for hosts
       and small IPv6 networks that would otherwise be unable to meet
       minimum IPv6 allocation criteria.  We conclude that DHCPv6 based
       solutions are suitable to solve the multihoming issues, described in
       this document, while NPTv6 may be required as an intermediate
       solution.

  "Basic Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers", Hemant Singh, Wes
  Beebee, Chris Donley, Barbara Stark, 30-Oct-12,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-6204bis-12.txt>

    This document specifies requirements for an IPv6 Customer Edge (CE)
    router.  Specifically, the current version of this document focuses
    on the basic provisioning of an IPv6 CE router and the provisioning
    of IPv6 hosts attached to it.  The document also covers IP transition
    technologies.  Two transition technologies in RFC 5969's 6rd and RFC
    6333's DS-Lite are covered in the document.  The document obsoletes
    RFC 6204, if approved.

  "Implementation Advice for IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard)",
  Fernando Gont, 14-Nov-12,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-ra-guard-implementation-07.txt>

    The IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) mechanism is commonly
       employed to mitigate attack vectors based on forged ICMPv6 Router
       Advertisement messages.  Many existing IPv6 deployments rely on RA-
       Guard as the first line of defense against the aforementioned attack
       vectors.  However, some implementations of RA-Guard have been found
       to be prone to circumvention by employing IPv6 Extension Headers.
       This document describes the evasion techniques that affect the
       aforementioned implementations, and formally updates RFC 6105, such
       that the aforementioned RA-Guard evasion vectors are eliminated.

  "Enterprise IPv6 Deployment Guidelines", KK Chittimaneni, Tim Chown, Lee
  Howard, Victor Kuarsingh, Yanick Pouffary, Eric Vyncke, 25-Feb-13,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-enterprise-incremental-ipv6-02.txt>

    Enterprise network administrators worldwide are in various stages of
       preparing for or deploying IPv6 into their networks.  The
       administrators face different challenges than operators of Internet
       access providers, and have reasons for different priorities.  The
       overall problem for many administrators will be to offer Internet-
       facing services over IPv6, while continuing to support IPv4, and
       while introducing IPv6 access within the enterprise IT network.  The
       overall transition will take most networks from an IPv4-only
       environment to a dual stack network environment and potentially an
       IPv6-only operating mode.  This document helps provide a framework
       for enterprise network architects or administrators who may be faced
       with many of these challenges as they consider their IPv6 support
       strategies.

  "NAT64 Deployment Considerations", Gang Chen, Zhen Cao, Cameron Byrne,
  Chongfeng Xie, David Binet, 31-Jan-13,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-nat64-experience-01.txt>

    This document summarizes NAT64 deployment scenarios and operational
    experience with stateful NAT64-CGN(NAT64 Carrier Grade NATs) and
    NAT64-FE (NAT64 server Front End).

  "IPv6 for 3GPP Cellular Hosts", Jouni Korhonen, Jari Arkko, Teemu
  Savolainen, Suresh Krishnan, 26-May-13,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-rfc3316bis-03.txt>

    As the deployment of third and fourth generation cellular networks
       progresses, a large number of cellular hosts are being connected to
       the Internet.  Standardization organizations have made Internet
       Protocol version 6 (IPv6) mandatory in their specifications.
       However, the concept of IPv6 covers many aspects and numerous
       specifications.  In addition, the characteristics of cellular links
       in terms of bandwidth, cost and delay put special requirements on how
       IPv6 is used.  This document considers IPv6 for cellular hosts that
       attach to the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Universal Mobile
       Telecommunications System (UMTS), or Evolved Packet System (EPS)
       networks (Hereafter collectively referred to as 3GPP networks).  This
       document also lists out specific IPv6 functionalities that need to be
       implemented in addition what is already prescribed in the IPv6 Node
       Requirements document.  It also discusses some issues related to the
       use of these components when operating in these networks.  This
       document obsoletes RFC 3316.

  "Extending an IPv6 /64 Prefix from a 3GPP Mobile Interface to a LAN",

       intended audience is someone designing an IPv6 network who is
       knowledgeable about best current practices around IPv4 network
       design, and wishes to learn the corresponding practices for IPv6.

  "Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Profile for 3GPP Mobile Devices",
  David Binet, Mohamed Boucadair, Vizdal Ales, Cameron Byrne, Gang Chen,
  11-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-v6ops-mobile-device-profile-04.txt>

    This document specifies an IPv6 profile for 3GPP mobile devices.  It
       lists the set of features a 3GPP mobile device is to be compliant
       with to connect to an IPv6-only or dual-stack wireless network
       (including 3GPP cellular network and IEEE 802.11 network).
    
       This document defines a different profile than the one for general
       connection to IPv6 cellular networks defined in
       [I-D.ietf-v6ops-rfc3316bis].  In particular, this document identifies
       also features to deliver IPv4 connectivity service over an IPv6-only
       transport.
    
       Both hosts and devices with capability to share their WAN (Wide Area
       Network) connectivity are in scope.

       usage scenarios and recommends use cases where ULA address may be
       beneficially used.

Web Security (websec)
---------------------

  "Public Key Pinning Extension for HTTP", Chris Evans, Chris Palmer, Ryan
  Sleevi, 18-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-websec-key-pinning-06.txt>

    This memo describes an extension to the HTTP protocol allowing web
       host operators to instruct user agents (UAs) to remember ("pin") the
       hosts' cryptographic identities for a given period of time.  During
       that time, UAs will require that the host present a certificate chain
       including at least one Subject Public Key Info structure whose
       fingerprint matches one of the pinned fingerprints for that host.  By
       effectively reducing the number of authorities who can authenticate
       the domain during the lifetime of the pin, pinning may reduce the
       incidence of man-in-the-middle attacks due to compromised
       Certification Authorities.

  "HTTP Header Field X-Frame-Options", David Ross, Tobias Gondrom,
  21-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-websec-x-frame-options-03.txt>

       this specification describes the X-Frame-Options HTTP response header
       field that declares a policy communicated from the server to the
       client browser on whether the browser may display the transmitted
       content in frames that are part of other web pages.  This
       informational document serves to document the existing use and
       specification of this X-Frame-Options HTTP response header field.

  "Web Security Framework: Problem Statement and Requirements", Jeff
  Hodges, 18-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-websec-framework-reqs-00.txt>

    This document describes JSON data structures representing
       registration information maintained by Regional Internet Registries
       (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs).  These data structures are
       used to form Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) query
       responses.

  "Registration Data Access Protocol Lookup Format", Andrew Newton, Scott
  Hollenbeck, 12-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-weirds-rdap-query-05.txt>

    This document describes uniform patterns to construct HTTP URLs that
       may be used to retrieve registration information from registries
       (including both Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name
       Registries (DNRs)) using "RESTful" web access patterns.

  "Security Services for the Registration Data Access Protocol", Scott
  Hollenbeck, Ning Kong, 3-Jun-13, <draft-ietf-weirds-rdap-sec-04.txt>

    The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) provides "RESTful" web
       services to retrieve registration metadata from domain name and
       regional internet registries.  This document describes information
       security services including authentication, authorization,
       availability, data confidentiality, and data integrity for RDAP.

  "HTTP usage in the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)", Andrew

    This document is one of a collection that together describe the
       Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP).  It describes how RDAP is
       transported using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

  "Redirection Service for Registration Data Access Protocol", Carlos
  Martinez, Arturo Servin, Linlin Zhou, Dario Gomez, Gerardo Rada,
  24-Feb-13, <draft-ietf-weirds-redirects-01.txt>

    The traditional WHOIS protocol has several important shortcomings,
       and over the past few years several approaches to a better
       Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) have been discussed and
       proposed.
    
       Among these shortcomings, different registries operate different
       WHOIS services.  For users this implies that several WHOIS queries to
       different registries may be necessary in order to obtain data for a
       given resource.
    
       This document describes a redirection service for RESTful WHOIS
       queries.  This service allows users to query a single WHOIS service
       and be redirected to the authoritative registry.
    
       The solution implemented proposed here applies to Regional Internet
       Registries(RIRs) and Domain Name Registries(DNRs).

  "Domain Name Registration Data Access Protocol Object Inventory
