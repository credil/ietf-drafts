IPv6 over Low power WPAN (6lowpan)
----------------------------------

  "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over BLUETOOTH Low Energy", Johanna
  Nieminen, Teemu Savolainen, Markus Isomaki, Basavaraj Patil, Zach
  Shelby, Carles Gomez, 2013-02-12, <draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle-12.txt>

      BLUETOOTH Low Energy is a low power air interface technology defined
      by the BLUETOOTH Special Interest Group (BT-SIG).  The standard
      BLUETOOTH radio has been widely implemented and available in mobile
      phones, notebook computers, audio headsets and many other devices.
      The low power version of BLUETOOTH is a new specification that
      enables the use of this air interface with devices such as sensors,
      smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low power variant of BLUETOOTH is
      currently specified in the revision 4.0 of the BLUETOOTH
      specifications (BLUETOOTH 4.0).  This document describes how IPv6 is
      transported over BLUETOOTH Low Energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

IPv6 Maintenance (6man)
-----------------------

  "Considerations for IPv6 Address Selection Policy Changes", Tim Chown,
  Arifumi Matsumoto, 2013-04-01,
  <draft-ietf-6man-addr-select-considerations-05.txt>

      This ducument is intended to capture the address selection design
      team's considerations about the address selection issues mainly
      raised in [RFC5220].  This considerations led to the revision of RFC
      3484 [RFC6724], and Address Selection DHCP option.  Although it does
      not perfectly match the current state, this document captures the
      past discussion and considerations for the historical record.

  "Distributing Address Selection Policy using DHCPv6", Arifumi Matsumoto,
  Tomohiro Fujisaki, Tim Chown, 2013-08-07,
  <draft-ietf-6man-addr-select-opt-11.txt>

      RFC 6724 defines default address selection mechanisms for IPv6 that
      allow nodes to select an appropriate address when faced with multiple
      source and/or destination addresses to choose between.  RFC 6724
      allows for the future definition of methods to administratively
      configure the address selection policy information.  This document
      defines a new DHCPv6 option for such configuration, allowing a site
      administrator to distribute address selection policy overriding the
      default address selection parameters and policy table, and thus to
      control the address selection behavior of nodes in their site.

  "Neighbor Unreachability Detection is too impatient", Erik Nordmark,
  Igor Gashinsky, 2013-04-24, <draft-ietf-6man-impatient-nud-06.txt>

      IPv6 Neighbor Discovery includes Neighbor Unreachability Detection.
      That function is very useful when a host has an alternative neighbor,
      for instance when there are multiple default routers, since it allows
      the host to switch to the alternative neighbor in short time.  This
      time is 3 seconds after the node starts probing by default.  However,
      if there are no alternative neighbors, this is far too impatient.
      This document specifies relaxed rules for Neighbor Discovery
      retransmissions that allow an implementation to choose different
      timeout behavior based on whether or not there are alternative
      neighbors.  This document updates RFC 4861.

  "Enhanced Duplicate Address Detection", Rajiv Asati, Hemant Singh, Wes
  Beebee, Eli Dart, Wesley George, Carlos Pignataro, 2013-05-24,
  <draft-ietf-6man-enhanced-dad-03.txt>

      Appendix A of the IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) document in
      RFC 4862 discusses Loopback Suppression and DAD.  However, RFC 4862
      does not settle on one specific automated means to detect loopback of
      Neighbor Discovery (ND of RFC 4861) messages used by DAD.  Several
      service provider communities have expressed a need for automated
      detection of looped backed ND messages used by DAD.  This document
      includes mitigation techniques and then outlines the Enhanced DAD
      algorithm to automate detection of looped back IPv6 ND messages used
      by DAD.  For network loopback tests, the Enhanced DAD algorithm
      allows IPv6 to self-heal after a loopback is placed and removed.
      Further, for certain access networks the document automates resolving
      a specific duplicate address conflict.

  "A method for Generating Stable Privacy-Enhanced Addresses with IPv6
  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)", Fernando Gont, 2013-08-08,
  <draft-ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses-11.txt>

      This document specifies a method for generating IPv6 Interface
      Identifiers to be used with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
      (SLAAC), such that addresses configured using this method are stable
      within each subnet, but the Interface Identifier changes when hosts
      move from one network to another.  This method is meant to be an
      alternative to generating Interface Identifiers based on hardware
      address (e.g., using IEEE identifiers), such that the benefits of
      stable addresses can be achieved without sacrificing the privacy of
      users.  The method specified in this document applies to all prefixes
      a host may be employing, including link-local, global, and unique-
      local addresses.

  "Security Implications of IPv6 Fragmentation with IPv6 Neighbor
  Discovery", Fernando Gont, 2013-06-02,
  <draft-ietf-6man-nd-extension-headers-05.txt>

      This document analyzes the security implications of employing IPv6
      fragmentation with Neighbor Discovery (ND) messages.  It updates RFC
      4861 such that use of the IPv6 Fragmentation Header is forbidden in
      all Neighbor Discovery messages, thus allowing for simple and
      effective counter-measures for Neighbor Discovery attacks.  Finally,
      it discusses the security implications of using IPv6 fragmentation
      with SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND), and formally updates RFC 3971
      to provide advice regarding how the aforementioned security
      implications can be prevented.

  "Implications of Oversized IPv6 Header Chains", Fernando Gont, Vishwas
  Manral, Ron Bonica, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-6man-oversized-header-chain-03.txt>

      The IPv6 specification allows IPv6 header chains of an arbitrary
      size.  The specification also allows options which can in turn extend
      each of the headers.  In those scenarios in which the IPv6 header
      chain or options are unusually long and packets are fragmented, or
      scenarios in which the fragment size is very small, the first
      fragment of a packet may fail to include the entire IPv6 header
      chain.  This document discusses the interoperability and security
      problems of such traffic, and updates RFC 2460 such that the first
      fragment of a packet is required to contain the entire IPv6 header
      chain.

  "Packet loss resiliency for Router Solicitations", Suresh Krishnan,
  Dmitry Anipko, Dave Thaler, 2013-05-06,
  <draft-ietf-6man-resilient-rs-01.txt>

      When an interface on a host is initialized, the host transmits Router
      Solicitations in order to minimize the amount of time it needs to
      wait until the next unsolicited multicast Router Advertisement is
      received.  In certain scenarios, these router solicitations
      transmitted by the host might be lost.  This document specifies a
      mechanism for hosts to cope with the loss of the initial Router
      Solicitations.  Furthermore, on some links, unsolicited multicast
      Router Advertisements are never sent and the mechanism in this
      document is intended to work even in such scenarios.

  "Security Implications of Predictable Fragment Identification Values",
  Fernando Gont, 2013-03-22,
  <draft-ietf-6man-predictable-fragment-id-00.txt>

      IPv6 specifies the Fragment Header, which is employed for the
      fragmentation and reassembly mechanisms.  The Fragment Header
      contains an "Identification" field which, together with the IPv6
      Source Address and the IPv6 Destination Address of the packet,
      identifies fragments that correspond to the same original datagram,
      such that they can be reassembled together at the receiving host.
      The only requirement for setting the "Identification" value is that
      it must be different than that of any other fragmented packet sent
      recently with the same Source Address and Destination Address.  Some
      implementations simply use a global counter for setting the Fragment
      Identification field, thus leading to predictable values.  This
      document analyzes the security implications of predictable
      Identification values, and updates RFC 2460 specifying additional
      requirements for setting the Fragment Identification, such that the
      aforementioned security implications are mitigated.

  "Significance of IPv6 Interface Identifiers", Brian Carpenter, Sheng
  Jiang, 2013-08-05, <draft-ietf-6man-ug-02.txt>

      The IPv6 addressing architecture includes a unicast interface
      identifier that is used in the creation of many IPv6 addresses.
      Interface identifiers are formed by a variety of methods.  This
      document clarifies that the bits in an interface identifier have no
      generic meaning and that the identifier should be treated as an
      opaque value.  In particular, RFC 4291 defines a method by which the
      Universal and Group bits of an IEEE link-layer address are mapped
      into an IPv6 unicast interface identifier.  This document clarifies
      that those bits apply only to interface identifiers that are derived
      from an IEEE link-layer address.  It updates RFC 4291 accordingly.

  "Transmission of IPv6 Extension Headers", Brian Carpenter, Sheng Jiang,
  2013-08-05, <draft-ietf-6man-ext-transmit-02.txt>

      Various IPv6 extension headers have been standardised since the IPv6
      standard was first published.  This document updates RFC 2460 to
      clarify how intermediate nodes should deal with such extension
      headers and with any that are defined in future.  It also specifies
      how extension headers should be registered by IANA, with a
      corresponding minor update to RFC 2780.

  "Updates to the IPv6 Multicast Addressing Architecture", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Stig Venaas, 2013-05-23,
  <draft-ietf-6man-multicast-addr-arch-update-01.txt>

      This document updates the IPv6 multicast addressing architecture by
      defining the 17-20 reserved bits as generic flag bits.  The document
      provides also some clarifications related to the use of these flag
      bits.
      
      This document updates RFC 3956, RFC 3306, RFC 4607 and RFC 4291.

IPv6 Site Renumbering (6renum)
------------------------------

  "IPv6 Site Renumbering Gap Analysis", Bing Liu, Sheng Jiang, Brian
  Carpenter, Stig Venaas, Wesley George, 2013-06-09,
  <draft-ietf-6renum-gap-analysis-08.txt>

      This document briefly introduces the existing mechanisms that could
      be utilized for IPv6 site renumbering and tries to cover most of the
      explicit issues and requirements of IPv6 renumbering. Its main
      content is a gap analysis that provides a basis for future works to
      identify and develop solutions or to stimulate such development as
      appropriate. The gap analysis is organized by the main steps of a
      renumbering process.

Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond web (abfab)
------------------------------------------------------------

  "A GSS-API Mechanism for the Extensible Authentication Protocol", Sam
  Hartman, Josh Howlett, 2012-08-13, <draft-ietf-abfab-gss-eap-09.txt>

      This document defines protocols, procedures, and conventions to be
      employed by peers implementing the Generic Security Service
      Application Program Interface (GSS-API) when using the Extensible
      Authentication Protocol mechanism.  Through the GS2 family of
      mechanisms defined in RFC 5801, these protocols also define how
      Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL, RFC 4422)
      applications use the Extensible Authentication Protocol.

  "Name Attributes for the GSS-API EAP mechanism", Sam Hartman, Josh
  Howlett, 2012-11-14, <draft-ietf-abfab-gss-eap-naming-07.txt>

      The naming extensions to the Generic Security Services Application
      Programming interface provide a mechanism for applications to
      discover authorization and personalization information associated
      with GSS-API names.  The Extensible Authentication Protocol GSS-API
      mechanism allows an Authentication/Authorization/Accounting peer to
      provide authorization attributes along side an authentication
      response.  It also provides mechanisms to process Security Assertion
      Markup Language (SAML) messages provided in the AAA response.  This
      document describes the necessary information to use the naming
      extensions API to access that information.

  "A RADIUS Attribute, Binding, Profiles, Name Identifier Format, and
  Confirmation Methods for SAML", Josh Howlett, Sam Hartman, 2013-07-03,
  <draft-ietf-abfab-aaa-saml-06.txt>

      This document specifies a RADIUS attribute, a binding, a name
      identifier format, two profiles, and two confirmation methods for the
      Security Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML).  The attribute provides
      RADIUS encapsulation of SAML protocol messages, and the binding
      describes the use of this attribute, and the SAML protocol messages
      within, with RADIUS transport.  The two profiles describe the
      application of this binding for ABFAB authentication and assertion
      query/request respectively.  The name identifier format allows a
      subject to be named using an NAI, and the subject confirmation
      methods allow queries to be issued for a principal without needing to
      explicitly name the intended subject within the request.  These
      artifacts have been defined to permit application in scenarios other
      than ABFAB, such as network access.

  "Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond web (ABFAB) Use
  Cases", Rhys Smith, 2012-09-25, <draft-ietf-abfab-usecases-05.txt>

      Federated identity is typically associated with Web-based services at
      present, but there is growing interest in its application in non Web-
      based contexts.  The goal of this document is to document a selection
      of the wide variety of these contexts whose user experience could be
      improved through the use of technologies based on the ABFAB
      architecture and specifications.

  "Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond Web (ABFAB)
  Architecture", Josh Howlett, Sam Hartman, Hannes Tschofenig, Eliot Lear,
  Jim Schaad, 2013-07-30, <draft-ietf-abfab-arch-07.txt>

      Over the last decade a substantial amount of work has occurred in the
      space of federated access management.  Most of this effort has
      focused on two use cases: network access and web-based access.
      However, the solutions to these use cases that have been proposed and
      deployed tend to have few common building blocks in common.
      
      This memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions to
      the commonly used security mechanisms for both federated and non-
      federated access management, including the Remote Authentication Dial
      In User Service (RADIUS) and the Diameter protocol, the Generic
      Security Service (GSS), the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
      and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).  The architecture
      addresses the problem of federated access management to primarily
      non-web-based services, in a manner that will scale to large numbers
      of identity providers, relying parties, and federations.

  "Update to the EAP Applicability Statement for ABFAB", Stefan Winter,
  Joseph Salowey, 2013-07-08, <draft-ietf-abfab-eapapplicability-05.txt>

      This document updates the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
      applicability statement from RFC3748 to reflect recent usage of the
      EAP protocol in the Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond
      web (ABFAB) architecture.

ADSL MIB (adslmib)
------------------

  "Definitions of Managed Objects for Very High Speed Digital Subscriber
  Line 2 (VDSL2)", Scott Baillie, Markus Freudenberger, Moti Morgenstern,
  2013-08-01, <draft-ietf-adslmib-xdsl-vop-02.txt>

      This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for
      use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
      particular, it describes objects used for managing parameters of the
      "Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Line 2 (VDSL2)" interface type,
      which are also applicable for managing Asymmetric Digital Subscriber
      Line (ADSL), ADSL2, and ADSL2+ interfaces.

Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (alto)
---------------------------------------------

  "ALTO Protocol", Richard Alimi, Reinaldo Penno, Yang Yang, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-alto-protocol-17.txt>

      Applications using the Internet already have access to some topology
      information of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks.  For
      example, views to Internet routing tables at looking glass servers
      are available and can be practically downloaded to many application
      clients.  What is missing is knowledge of the underlying network
      topologies from the point of view of ISPs.  In other words, what an
      ISP prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and a way to
      distribute it.
      
      The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service provides
      network information (e.g., basic network location structure and
      preferences of network paths) with the goal of modifying network
      resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving
      application performance.  The basic information of ALTO is based on
      abstract maps of a network.  These maps provide a simplified view,
      yet enough information about a network for applications to
      effectively utilize them.  Additional services are built on top of
      the maps.
      
      This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO Service.
      Although the ALTO Service would primarily be provided by ISPs, other
      entities such as content service providers could also operate an ALTO
      service.  Applications that could use this service are those that
      have a choice to which end points to connect.  Examples of such
      applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.

  "ALTO Deployment Considerations", Martin Stiemerling, Sebastian Kiesel,
  Stefano Previdi, Michael Scharf, 2013-07-16,
  <draft-ietf-alto-deployments-07.txt>

      Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as
      pieces of information or server processes, which are available in
      several equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but
      is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal
      of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
      guidance to these applications, which have to select one or several
      hosts from a set of candidates that are able to provide a desired
      resource.  This memo discusses deployment related issues of ALTO.  It
      addresses different use cases of ALTO such as peer-to-peer file
      sharing and CDNs, security considerations, recommendations for
      network administrators, and also guidance for application designers
      using ALTO.

  "ALTO Server Discovery", Sebastian Kiesel, Martin Stiemerling, Nico
  Schwan, Michael Scharf, Song Yongchao, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-alto-server-discovery-09.txt>

      The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
      provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several
      hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired
      resource.  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an
      ALTO client can ask for guidance it needs to discover one or more
      ALTO servers.
      
      This document specifies a procedure for resource consumer initiated
      ALTO server discovery, which can be used if the ALTO client is
      embedded in the resource consumer.

Access Node Control Protocol (ancp)
-----------------------------------

  "Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) MIB module for Access Nodes",
  Stefaan De Cnodder, Moti Morgenstern, 2013-06-24,
  <draft-ietf-ancp-mib-an-11.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
      objects for managing access nodes that are using the Access Node
      Control Protocol (ANCP).

  "Multicast Control Extensions for ANCP", Francois Le Faucheur, Roberta
  Maglione, Tom Taylor, 2013-02-24, <draft-ietf-ancp-mc-extensions-09.txt>

      This document specifies the extensions to the Access Node Control
      Protocol required for support of the multicast use cases defined in
      the Access Node Control Protocol framework document and one
      additional use case described in this document.  These use cases are
      organized into the following ANCP capabilities:
      
      o  NAS-initiated multicast replication;
      
      o  conditional access with white and black lists;
      
      o  conditional access with grey lists;
      
      o  bandwidth delegation;
      
      o  committed bandwidth reporting.
      
      These capabilities may be combined according to the rules given in
      this specification.

Applications Area Working Group (appsawg)
-----------------------------------------

  "Advice for Safe Handling of Malformed Messages", Murray Kucherawy,
  Gregory Shapiro, Ned Freed, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-ietf-appsawg-malformed-mail-07.txt>

      Although Internet mail formats have been precisely defined since the
      1970s, authoring and handling software often show only mild
      conformance to the specifications.  The distributed and non-
      interactive nature of email has often prompted adjustments to
      receiving software, to handle these variations, rather than trying to
      gain better conformance by senders, since the receiving operator is
      primarily driven by complaining recipient users and has no authority
      over the sending side of the system.  Processing with such
      flexibility comes at some cost, since mail software is faced with
      decisions about whether or not to permit non-conforming messages to
      continue toward their destinations unaltered, adjust them to conform
      (possibly at the cost of losing some of the original message), or
      outright rejecting them.
      
      A core requirement for interoperability is that both sides of an
      exchange work from the same details and semantics.  By having
      receivers be flexible, beyond the specifications, there can be -- and
      often has been -- a good chance that a message will not be fully
      interoperable.  Worse, a well-established pattern of tolerance for
      variations can sometimes be used as an attack vector.
      
      This document includes a collection of the best advice available
      regarding a variety of common malformed mail situations, to be used
      as implementation guidance.  It must be emphasized, however, that the
      intent of this document is not to standardize malformations or
      otherwise encourage their proliferation.  The messages are manifestly
      malformed, and the code and culture that generates them needs to be
      fixed.  Therefore, these messages should be rejected outright if at
      all possible.  Nevertheless, many malformed messages from otherwise
      legitimate senders are in circulation and will be for some time, and,
      unfortunately, commercial reality shows that we cannot always simply
      reject or discard them.  Accordingly, this document presents
      alternatives for dealing with them in ways that seem to do the least
      additional harm until the infrastructure is tightened up to match the
      standards.

  "Spam reporting using IMAP: SREP", Zoltan Ordogh, 2013-03-11,
  <draft-ordogh-spam-reporting-using-imap-04.txt>

      This document defines an IMAP extension which allows a client to
      report spam by reference and allows an IMAP server to perform any
      action on the reported messages, including leaving the action at the
      client's discretion.
      
      In addition, this document discusses how an IMAP server can tap into
      spam aggregator services, ultimately allowing the IMAP server to
      improve its decision-making process.
      
      Conventions Used In This Document
      
      In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client or the
      server, respectively.

  "Forwarded HTTP Extension", Andreas Petersson, Martin Nilsson,
  2012-10-09, <draft-ietf-appsawg-http-forwarded-10.txt>

      This document defines an HTTP extension header field that allows
      proxy components to disclose information lost in the proxying
      process, for example, the originating IP address of a request or IP
      address of the proxy on the user-agent-facing interface.  In a path
      of proxying components, this makes it possible to arrange it so that
      each subsequent component will have access to, for example, all IP
      addresses used in the chain of proxied HTTP requests.
      
      This document also specifies guidelines for a proxy administrator to
      anonymize the origin of a request.

  "WebFinger", Paul Jones, Gonzalo Salgueiro, Joseph Smarr, 2013-08-09,
  <draft-ietf-appsawg-webfinger-17.txt>

      This specification defines the WebFinger protocol, which can be used
      to discover information about people or other entities on the
      Internet using standard HTTP methods.  WebFinger discovers
      information for a URI that might not be usable as a locator
      otherwise, such as account or email URIs.

  "The 'acct' URI Scheme", Peter Saint-Andre, 2013-07-02,
  <draft-ietf-appsawg-acct-uri-06.txt>

      This document defines the 'acct' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
      scheme as a way to identify a user's account at a service provider,
      irrespective of the particular protocols that can be used to interact
      with the account.

  "XML Media Types", Chris Lilley, Murata Makoto, Alexey Melnikov, Henry
  Thompson, 2013-07-08, <draft-ietf-appsawg-xml-mediatypes-02.txt>

      This specification standardizes three media types -- application/xml,
      application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd --
      for use in exchanging network entities that are related to the
      Extensible Markup Language (XML) while defining text/xml and text/
      xml-external-parsed-entity as aliases for the respective application/
      types.  This specification also standardizes a convention (using the
      suffix '+xml') for naming media types outside of these five types
      when those media types represent XML MIME entities.
      
      Major differences from [RFC3023] are alignment of charset handling
      for text/xml and text/xml-external-parsed-entity with application/
      xml, the addition of XPointer and XML Base as fragment identifiers
      and base URIs, respectively, mention of the XPointer Registry, and
      updating of many references.

  "Message Header Field for Indicating Message Authentication Status",
  Murray Kucherawy, 2013-07-11, <draft-ietf-appsawg-rfc5451bis-10.txt>

      This document specifies a message header field called Authentication-
      Results for use with electronic mail messages to indicate the results
      of message authentication efforts.  Any receiver-side software, such
      as mail filters or Mail User Agents (MUAs), can use this header field
      to relay that information in a convenient and meaningful way to
      users, or make sorting and filtering decisions.

  "The application/json-merge-patch Media Type", James Snell, 2013-05-20,
  <draft-ietf-appsawg-json-merge-patch-00.txt>

      This specification defines the application/json-merge-patch media
      type and it's intended use with the HTTP PATCH method defined by RFC
      5789.

  "Sieve Email Filtering: Detecting Duplicate Deliveries", Stephan Bosch,
  2013-05-22, <draft-ietf-appsawg-sieve-duplicate-00.txt>

      This document defines a new test command "duplicate" for the "Sieve"
      email filtering language.  This test adds the ability to detect
      duplicate message deliveries.  The main application for this new test
      is handling duplicate deliveries commonly caused by mailing list
      subscriptions or redirected mail addresses.  The detection is
      normally performed by matching the message ID to an internal list of
      message IDs from previously delivered messages.  For more complex
      applications, the "duplicate" test can also use the content of a
      specific header or other parts of the message.

  "The Require-Recipient-Valid-Since Header Field", William Mills, Murray
  Kucherawy, 2013-08-02, <draft-wmills-rrvs-header-field-01.txt>

      This document defines an email header field, Require-Recipient-Valid-
      Since, to provide a method for senders to indicate to receivers the
      time when the sender last confirmed the ownership of the target
      mailbox.  This can be used to detect changes of mailbox ownership,
      and thus prevent mail from being delivered to the wrong party.
      
      The intended use of this header field is on automatically generated
      messages that might contain sensitive information.

  "Securing the RTP Protocol Framework: Why RTP Does Not Mandate a Single
  Media Security Solution", Colin Perkins, Magnus Westerlund, 2013-05-07,
  <draft-ietf-avt-srtp-not-mandatory-13.txt>

      This memo discusses the problem of securing real-time multimedia
      sessions, and explains why the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP),
      and the associated RTP control protocol (RTCP), do not mandate a
      single media security mechanism.  Guidelines for designers and
      reviewers of future RTP extensions are provided, to ensure that
      appropriate security mechanisms are mandated, and that any such
      mechanisms are specified in a manner that conforms with the RTP
      architecture.

  "Inter-destination Media Synchronization using the RTP Control Protocol
  (RTCP)", Ray van Brandenburg, Hans Stokking, Oskar van Deventer,
  Fernando Boronat, Mario Montagud, Kevin Gross, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-idms-12.txt>

      This document defines a new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Packet Type
      and an RTCP Extended Report (XR) Block Type to be used for achieving
      Inter-Destination Media Synchronization (IDMS).  IDMS is the process
      of synchronizing playout across multiple geographically distributed
      media receivers.  Using the RTCP XR IDMS Report Block defined in this
      document, media playout information from participants in a
      synchronization group can be collected.  Based on the collected
      information, an RTCP IDMS Settings Packet can then be sent to
      distribute a common target playout point to which all the distributed
      receivers, sharing a media experience, can synchronize.
      
      Typical use cases in which IDMS is useful are social TV, shared
      service control (i.e. applications where two or more geographically
      separated users are watching a media stream together), distance
      learning, networked video walls, networked loudspeakers, etc.

  "AES-GCM and AES-CCM Authenticated Encryption in Secure RTP (SRTP)",
  David McGrew, Kevin Igoe, 2013-07-03,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-srtp-aes-gcm-07.txt>

      This document defines how AES-GCM and AES-CCM Authenticated
      Encryption with Associated Data algorithms can be used to provide
      confidentiality and data authentication in the SRTP protocol.

  "The ARIA Algorithm and Its Use with the Secure Real-time Transport
  Protocol(SRTP)", Woo-Hwan Kim, Jungkeun Lee, Dong-Chan Kim, Je-Hong
  Park, Daesung Kwon, 2013-06-26,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-aria-srtp-03.txt,.pdf>

      This document describes the use of the ARIA block cipher algorithm
      within the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for providing
      confidentiality for the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) traffic
      and for the control traffic for RTP, the Real-time Transport Control
      Protocol (RTCP).  It details three modes of operation (CTR, CCM, GCM)
      and a SRTP Key Derivation Function for ARIA.

  "RTP and Leap Seconds", Kevin Gross, Ray van Brandenburg, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-leap-second-03.txt>

      This document discusses issues that arise when RTP sessions span
      Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) leap seconds.  It updates RFC 3550
      to describe how RTP senders and receivers should behave in the
      presence of leap seconds.

  "RTP Clock Source Signalling", Aidan Williams, Kevin Gross, Ray van
  Brandenburg, Hans Stokking, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-clksrc-05.txt>

      NTP format timestamps are used by several RTP protocols for
      synchronisation and statistical measurements.  This memo specifies
      SDP signalling identifying timestamp reference clock sources and SDP
      signalling identifying the media clock sources in a multimedia
      session.

  "Options for Securing RTP Sessions", Magnus Westerlund, Colin Perkins,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-security-options-04.txt>

      The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in a large number of
      different application domains and environments.  This heterogeneity
      implies that different security mechanisms are needed to provide
      services such as confidentiality, integrity and source authentication
      of RTP/RTCP packets suitable for the various environments.  The range
      of solutions makes it difficult for RTP-based application developers
      to pick the most suitable mechanism.  This document provides an
      overview of a number of security solutions for RTP, and gives
      guidance for developers on how to choose the appropriate security
      mechanism.

  "Sending Multiple Types of Media in a Single RTP Session", Magnus
  Westerlund, Colin Perkins, Jonathan Lennox, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-multi-media-rtp-session-03.txt>

      This document specifies how an RTP session can contain media streams
      with media from multiple media types such as audio, video, and text.
      This has been restricted by the RTP Specification, and thus this
      document updates RFC 3550 and RFC 3551 to enable this behaviour for
      applications that satisfy the applicability for using multiple media
      types in a single RTP session.

  "Multimedia Congestion Control: Circuit Breakers for Unicast RTP
  Sessions", Colin Perkins, Varun Singh, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers-03.txt>

      The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony,
      video conferencing, and telepresence applications.  Such applications
      are often run on best-effort UDP/IP networks.  If congestion control
      is not implemented in the applications, then network congestion will
      deteriorate the user's multimedia experience.  This document does not
      propose a congestion control algorithm; instead, it defines a minimal
      set of RTP "circuit-breakers".  Circuit-breakers are conditions under
      which an RTP sender needs to stop transmitting media data in order to
      protect the network from excessive congestion.  It is expected that,
      in the absence of severe congestion, all RTP applications running on
      best-effort IP networks will be able to run without triggering these
      circuit breakers.  Any future RTP congestion control specification
      will be expected to operate within the constraints defined by these
      circuit breakers.

  "Guidelines for Choosing RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Names
  (CNAMEs)", Ali Begen, Colin Perkins, Dan Wing, Eric Rescorla,
  2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-avtcore-6222bis-06.txt>

      The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Name (CNAME) is a
      persistent transport-level identifier for an RTP endpoint.  While the
      Synchronization Source (SSRC) identifier of an RTP endpoint may
      change if a collision is detected or when the RTP application is
      restarted, its RTCP CNAME is meant to stay unchanged, so that RTP
      endpoints can be uniquely identified and associated with their RTP
      media streams.
      
      For proper functionality, RTCP CNAMEs should be unique within the
      participants of an RTP session.  However, the existing guidelines for
      choosing the RTCP CNAME provided in the RTP standard are insufficient
      to achieve this uniqueness.  RFC 6222 was published to update those
      guidelines to allow endpoints to choose unique RTCP CNAMEs.
      Unfortunately, later investigations showed that some parts of the new
      algorithms were unnecessarily complicated and/or ineffective.  This
      document addresses these concerns and replaces RFC 6222.

  "Update to Remove DVI4 from the Recommended Codecs for the RTP Profile
  for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control (RTP/AVP)", Timothy
  Terriberry, 2013-07-02, <draft-ietf-avtcore-avp-codecs-03.txt>

      The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control
      (RTP/AVP) is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure
      Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for
      Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/
      AVPF), and the Extended Secure RTP Profile for RTCP-Based Feedback
      (RTP/SAVPF).  This document updates RFC 3551, the RTP/AVP profile
      (and by extension, the profiles that build upon it) to reflect
      changes in audio codec usage since the document was originally
      published.

  "RTP Topologies", Magnus Westerlund, Stephan Wenger, 2013-04-22,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-topologies-update-00.txt>

      This document discusses point to point and multi-endpoint topologies
      used in Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)-based environments.  In
      particular, centralized topologies commonly employed in the video
      conferencing industry are mapped to the RTP terminology.
      
      This document is updated with additional topologies and are intended
      to replace RFC 5117.

  "Guidelines for using the Multiplexing Features of RTP to Support
  Multiple Media Streams", Magnus Westerlund, BoB, Colin Perkins, Harald
  Alvestrand, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-avtcore-multiplex-guidelines-01.txt>

      The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a flexible protocol that
      can be used in a wide range of applications, networks, and system
      topologies.  That flexibility makes for wide applicability, but can
      complicate the application design process.  One particular design
      question that has received much attention is how to support multiple
      media streams in RTP.  This memo discusses the available options and
      design trade-offs, and provides guidelines on how to use the
      multiplexing features of RTP to support multiple media streams.

  "Sending Multiple Media Streams in a Single RTP Session", Jonathan
  Lennox, Magnus Westerlund, Wenson Wu, Colin Perkins, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-01.txt>

      This document expands and clarifies the behavior of the Real-Time
      Transport Protocol (RTP) endpoints when they are sending multiple
      media streams in a single RTP session.  In particular, issues
      involving Real-Time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) messages are
      described.
      
      This document updates RFC 3550 in regards to handling of multiple
      SSRCs per endpoint in RTP sessions.

  "Sending Multiple Media Streams in a Single RTP Session: Grouping RTCP
  Reception Statistics and Other Feedback", Jonathan Lennox, Magnus
  Westerlund, Wenson Wu, Colin Perkins, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-optimisation-00.txt>

      RTP allows multiple media streams to be sent in a single session, but
      requires each Synchronisation Source (SSRC) to send RTCP reception
      quality reports for every other SSRC visible in the session.  This
      causes the number of RTCP reception reports to grow with the number
      of SSRCs, rather than the number of endpoints.  In many cases most of
      these RTCP reception reports are unnecessary, since all SSRCs of an
      endpoint are co-located and see the same reception quality.  This
      memo defines a Reporting Group extension to RTCP to reduce the
      reporting overhead in such scenarios.

Audio/Video Transport Extensions (avtext)

  "Support for Multiple Clock Rates in an RTP Session", Marc
  Petit-Huguenin, Glen Zorn, 2013-04-21,
  <draft-ietf-avtext-multiple-clock-rates-09.txt>

      This document clarifies the RTP specification when different clock
      rates are used in an RTP session.  It also provides guidance on how
      to interoperate with legacy RTP implementations that use multiple
      clock rates.

  "Duplicating RTP Streams", Ali Begen, Colin Perkins, 2013-03-21,
  <draft-ietf-avtext-rtp-duplication-02.txt>

      Packet loss is undesirable for real-time multimedia sessions, but can
      occur due to congestion, or other unplanned network outages.  This is
      especially true for IP multicast networks, where packet loss patterns
      can vary greatly between receivers.  One technique that can be used
      to recover from packet loss without incurring unbounded delay for all
      the receivers is to duplicate the packets and send them in separate
      redundant streams.  This document explains how Real-time Transport
      Protocol (RTP) streams can be duplicated without breaking RTP or RTP
      Control Protocol (RTCP) rules.

Behavior Engineering for Hindrance Avoidance (behave)
-----------------------------------------------------

  "Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Network Address
  Translation", Randall Stewart, Michael Tuexen, Irene Ruengeler,
  2013-02-25, <draft-ietf-behave-sctpnat-08.txt>

      Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable
      communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to
      TCP [RFC0793].  With the widespread deployment of Network Address
      Translators (NAT), specialized code has been added to NAT for TCP
      that allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT and yet use only a
      single globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts (behind a
      NAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection.  This
      additional code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port
      Translation or NAPT.  To date, specialized code for SCTP has NOT yet
      been added to most NATs so that only pure NAT is available.  The end
      result of this is that only one SCTP capable host can be behind a
      NAT.
      
      This document describes an SCTP specific variant of NAT which
      provides similar features of NAPT in the single point and multi-point
      traversal scenario.

  "Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis", Teemu
  Savolainen, Jouni Korhonen, Dan Wing, 2013-04-04,
  <draft-ietf-behave-nat64-discovery-heuristic-17.txt>

      This document describes a method for detecting the presence of DNS64
      and for learning the IPv6 prefix used for protocol translation on an
      access network.  The method depends on the existence of a well-known
      IPv4-only fully qualified domain name "ipv4only.arpa".  The
      information learned enables nodes to perform local IPv6 address
      synthesis and to potentially avoid NAT64 on dual-stack and multi-
      interface deployments.

  "Analysis of solution proposals for hosts to learn NAT64 prefix", Jouni
  Korhonen, Teemu Savolainen, 2012-03-08,
  <draft-ietf-behave-nat64-learn-analysis-03.txt>

      Hosts and applications may benefit from the knowledge if an IPv6
      address is synthesized, which would mean a NAT64 is used to reach the
      IPv4 network or Internet.  This document analyses a number of
      proposed solutions for communicating whether the synthesis is taking
      place, used address format, and the IPv6 prefix used by the NAT64 and
      DNS64.  The solutions enable both NAT64 avoidance and intentional
      utilization by allowing local IPv6 address synthesis.  The document
      concludes by recommending selection of heuristic discovery based
      solution.

  "Additional Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)",
  Simon Perreault, Tina Tsou, Senthil Sivakumar, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-behave-nat-mib-07.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for devices implementing Network Address Translator (NAT) function.
      This MIB module may be used for monitoring of a device capable of NAT
      function.

  "Syslog Format for NAT Logging", Zhonghua Chen, Cathy Zhou, Tina Tsou,
  Tom Taylor, 2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-behave-syslog-nat-logging-02.txt>

      With the wide deployment of Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) devices, the
      logging of NAT-related events has become very important for various
      operational purposes.  The logs may be required for troubleshooting,
      to identify a host that was used to launch malicious attacks, and/or
      for accounting purposes.  This document identifies the events that
      need to be logged and the parameters that are required in the logs
      depending on the context in which the NAT is being used.  It goes on
      to standardize formats for reporting these events and parameters
      using SYSLOG (RFC 5424).  A companion document specifies formats for
      reporting the same events and parameters using IPFIX (RFC 5101).
      Applicability statements are provided in this document and its
      companion to guide operators and implementors in their choice of
      which technology to use for logging.

  "IPFIX Information Elements for logging NAT Events", Senthil Sivakumar,
  Reinaldo Penno, 2013-03-19, <draft-ietf-behave-ipfix-nat-logging-00.txt>

      NAT devices are required to log events like creation and deletion of
      translations and information about the resources it is managing.
      With the wide deployment of Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) devices, the
      logging of events have become very important for legal purposes.  The
      logs are required in many cases to identify an attacker or a host
      that was used to launch malicious attacks and/or for various other
      purposes of accounting.  Since there is no standard way of logging
      this information, different NAT devices behave differently and hence
      it is difficult to expect a consistent behavior.  The lack of a
      consistent way makes it difficult to write the collector applications
      that would receive this data and process it to present useful
      information.  This document describes the information that is
      required to be logged by the NAT devices.

  "Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements Updates",
  Reinaldo Penno, Simon Perreault, Mohamed Boucadair, Kengo Naito,
  2013-06-03, <draft-ietf-behave-requirements-update-00.txt>

      This document clarifies and updates several requirements of RFC4787,
      RFC5382 and RFC5508 based on operational and development experience.
      The focus of this document is NAPT44.

Binary Floor Control Protocol Bis  (bfcpbis)
--------------------------------------------

  "The Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP)", Gonzalo Camarillo, Keith
  Drage, Tom Kristensen, Joerg Ott, Charles Eckel, 2013-04-26,
  <draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis-09.txt>

      Floor control is a means to manage joint or exclusive access to
      shared resources in a (multiparty) conferencing environment.
      Thereby, floor control complements other functions -- such as
      conference and media session setup, conference policy manipulation,
      and media control -- that are realized by other protocols.
      
      This document specifies the Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP).
      BFCP is used between floor participants and floor control servers,
      and between floor chairs (i.e., moderators) and floor control
      servers.
      
      This document obsoletes RFC 4582.  Changes from RFC 4582 are
      summarized in Section 16.

  Protocol (BFCP) Streams", Gonzalo Camarillo, Tom Kristensen, 2013-04-26,
  <draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4583bis-07.txt>

      This document specifies how to describe Binary Floor Control Protocol
      (BFCP) streams in Session Description Protocol (SDP) descriptions.
      User agents using the offer/answer model to establish BFCP streams
      use this format in their offers and answers.
      
      This document obsoletes RFC 4583.  Changes from RFC 4583 are
      summarized in Section 12.

Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (bfd)
----------------------------------------

  "BFD Management Information Base", Thomas Nadeau, Zafar Ali, Nobo Akiya,
  2013-06-26, <draft-ietf-bfd-mib-14.txt,.pdf>

      This draft defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
      In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling
      Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol.

  "Definitions of Textual Conventions (TCs) for Bidirectional Forwarding
  Detection (BFD) Management", Thomas Nadeau, Zafar Ali, Nobo Akiya,
  2013-06-19, <draft-ietf-bfd-tc-mib-02.txt,.pdf>

      This draft defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module which
      contains Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Bidirectional
      Forwarding Detection (BFD) management information.  The intent is
      that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in BFD
      related MIB modules that would otherwise define their own
      representations.

  "BFD Generic Cryptographic Authentication", Manav Bhatia, Vishwas
  Manral, Dacheng Zhang, 2013-04-18,
  <draft-ietf-bfd-generic-crypto-auth-04.txt>

      This document proposes an extension to Bidirectional Forwarding
      Detection (BFD) to allow the use of arbitary cryptographic
      authentication algorithms in addition to the already-documented
      authentication schemes described in the base specification.  This
      document adds the basic infrastructure that is required for
      supporting algorithm and key agility for BFD.

  "BFD for Multipoint Networks", Dave Katz, David Ward, 2013-05-17,
  <draft-ietf-bfd-multipoint-02.txt>

      This document describes extensions to the Bidirectional Forwarding
      Detection (BFD) protocol for its use in multipoint and multicast
      networks.  Comments on this draft should be directed to
      rtg-bfd@ietf.org.

  "Authenticating BFD using HMAC-SHA-2 procedures", Dacheng Zhang, Manav
  Bhatia, Vishwas Manral, 2013-04-18, <draft-ietf-bfd-hmac-sha-03.txt>

      This document describes the mechanism to authenticate Bidirectional
      Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol packets using Hashed Message
      Authentication Mode (HMAC) with the SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512
      algorithms.  The described mechanism uses the Generic Cryptographic
      Authentication and Generic Meticulous Cryptographic Authentication
      sections to carry the authentication data.  This document updates,
      but does not supercede, the cryptographic authentication mechanism
      specified in RFC 5880.

  "BFD Management Information Base (MIB) extensions for MPLS and MPLS-TP
  Networks", Sam Aldrin, Venkatesan Mahalingam, Kannan Sampath, Thomas
  Nadeau, 2013-06-27, <draft-ietf-bfd-mpls-mib-02.txt>

      This draft defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
      In particular, it extends the BFD Management Information Base BFD-
      STD-MIB and describes the managed objects for modeling Bidirectional
      Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol for MPLS and MPLS-TP networks.

  "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) on Link Aggregation Group
  (LAG) Interfaces", Manav Bhatia, Mach Chen, Sami Boutros, Marc
  Binderberger, Jeffrey Haas, 2013-06-13, <draft-ietf-bfd-on-lags-01.txt>

      This document proposes a mechanism to run BFD on Link Aggregation
      Group (LAG) interfaces.  It does so by running an independent
      Asynchronous mode BFD session on every LAG member link.
      
      This mechanism allows the verification of member link continuity,
      either in combination with, or in absence of, LACP.  It provides a
      shorter detection time than what LACP offers.  The continuity check
      can also cover elements of layer 3 bidirectional forwarding.
      
      This mechanism utilizes a well-known UDP port distinct from that of
      single-hop BFD over IP.  This new UDP port removes the ambiguity of
      BFD over LAG packets from BFD over single-hop IP.

      This document describes the requirements and implementation of a
      group telephony feature commonly known as Bridged Line Appearance
      (BLA) or Multiple Line Appearance (MLA), or Shared Call/Line
      Appearance (SCA).  When implemented using the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP), it is referred to as shared appearances of an Address
      of Record (AOR) since SIP does not have the concept of lines.  This
      feature is commonly offered in IP Centrex services and IP-PBX
      offerings and is likely to be implemented on SIP IP telephones and
      SIP feature servers used in a business environment.  This feature
      allows several user agents (UAs) to share a common AOR, learn about
      calls placed and received by other UAs in the group, and pick up or
      join calls within the group.  This document discusses use cases,
      lists requirements and defines extensions to implement this feature.
      This specification updates RFC3261 and RFC4235.

Benchmarking Methodology (bmwg)

  "Basic BGP Convergence Benchmarking Methodology for Data Plane
  Convergence", Rajiv Papneja, Bhavani Parise, Susan Hares, Dean Lee, Ilya
  Varlashkin, 2013-07-02, <draft-ietf-bmwg-bgp-basic-convergence-00.txt>

      BGP is widely deployed and used by several service providers as the
      default Inter AS routing protocol.  It is of utmost importance to
      ensure that when a BGP peer or a downstream link of a BGP peer fails,
      the alternate paths are rapidly used and routes via these alternate
      paths are installed.  This document provides the basic BGP
      Benchmarking Methodology using existing BGP Convergence Terminology,
      RFC 4098.

  Switched Optical Networks", Young Lee, Greg Bernstein, Dan Li, Wataru
  Imajuku, 2013-05-13, <draft-ietf-ccamp-rwa-info-18.txt>

      This document provides a model of information needed by the routing
      and wavelength assignment (RWA) process in wavelength switched
      optical networks (WSONs).  The purpose of the information described
      in this model is to facilitate constrained lightpath computation in
      WSONs. This model takes into account compatibility constraints
      between WSON signal attributes and network elements but does not
      include constraints due to optical impairments. Aspects of this
      information that may be of use to other technologies utilizing a
      GMPLS control plane are discussed.

  "Routing and Wavelength Assignment Information Encoding for Wavelength
  Switched Optical Networks", Greg Bernstein, Young Lee, Dan Li, Wataru
  Imajuku, 2013-03-15, <draft-ietf-ccamp-rwa-wson-encode-20.txt>

      A wavelength switched optical network (WSON) requires that certain
      key information elements are made available to facilitate path
      computation and the establishment of label switching paths (LSPs).
      The information model described in "Routing and Wavelength
      Assignment Information for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks"
      shows what information is required at specific points in the WSON.
      Part of the WSON information model contains aspects that may be of
      general applicability to other technologies, while other parts are
      fairly specific to WSONs.
      
      This document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for
      the WSON specific information elements. It is intended that
      protocol-specific documents will reference this memo to describe how
      information is carried for specific uses. Such encodings can be used
      to extend GMPLS signaling and routing protocols. In addition these
      encodings could be used by other mechanisms to convey this same
      information to a path computation element (PCE).

  "GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for Ethernet OAM Configuration", Attila
  Takacs, Balazs Gero, Hao Long, 2013-06-15,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-eth-oam-ext-10.txt>

      The GMPLS controlled Ethernet Label Switching (GELS) work extended
      GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the establishment of Ethernet LSPs.  IEEE
      Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) specifies an adjunct OAM
      flow to check connectivity in Ethernet networks.  CFM can be also
      used with Ethernet LSPs for fault detection and triggering recovery
      mechanisms.  The ITU-T Y.1731 specification builds on CFM and
      specifies additional OAM mechanisms, including Performance
      Monitoring, for Ethernet networks.  This document specifies
      extensions of GMPLS RSVP-TE protocol to support the setup of the
      associated Ethernet OAM entities of Ethernet LSPs, and defines the
      Ethernet technology specific TLVs based on [OAM-CONF-FWK].  This
      document supports, but does not modify, the IEEE and ITU-T OAM
      mechanisms.

  "GMPLS RSVP-TE extensions for OAM Configuration", Attila Takacs, Don
  Fedyk, He Jia, 2013-06-15,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-oam-configuration-fwk-10.txt>

      OAM is an integral part of transport connections, hence it is
      required that OAM functions are activated/deactivated in sync with
      connection commissioning/decommissioning; avoiding spurious alarms
      and ensuring consistent operation.  In certain technologies, OAM
      entities are inherently established once the connection is set up,
      while other technologies require extra configuration to establish and
      configure OAM entities.  This document specifies extensions to
      RSVP-TE to support the establishment and configuration of OAM
      entities along with LSP signaling.

  "General Network Element Constraint Encoding for GMPLS Controlled
  Networks", Greg Bernstein, Young Lee, Dan Li, Wataru Imajuku,
  2013-05-06, <draft-ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode-11.txt>

      Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching can be used to control a
      wide variety of technologies. In some of these technologies network
      elements and links may impose additional routing constraints such as
      asymmetric switch connectivity, non-local label assignment, and
      label range limitations on links.
      
      This document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for
      general information elements representing connectivity and label
      constraints as well as label availability. It is intended that
      protocol-specific documents will reference this memo to describe how
      information is carried for specific uses.

  Bernstein, Sugang Xu, Young Lee, Giovanni Martinelli, Hiroaki Harai,
  2013-07-05, <draft-ietf-ccamp-wson-signaling-06.txt>

      This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
      Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched
      optical networks (WSON).  Such extensions are necessary in WSONs
      under a number of conditions including: (a) when optional
      processing, such as regeneration, must be configured to occur at
      specific nodes along a path, (b) where equipment must be configured
      to accept an optical signal with specific attributes, or (c) where
      equipment must be configured to output an optical signal with
      specific attributes. In addition this memo provides mechanisms to
      support distributed wavelength assignment with bidirectional LSPs,
      and choice in distributed wavelength assignment algorithms. These
      extensions build on previous work for the control of lambda and
      G.709 based networks.

  "OSPF-TE Extensions for General Network Element Constraints", Fatai
  Zhang, Young Lee, Jianrui Han, Greg Bernstein, Yunbin Xu, 2013-06-26,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-general-constraints-ospf-te-05.txt>

      Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching can be used to control a
      wide variety of technologies including packet switching (e.g., MPLS),
      time-division (e.g., SONET/SDH, OTN), wavelength (lambdas), and
      spatial switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port or
      fiber). In some of these technologies network elements and links may
      impose additional routing constraints such as asymmetric switch
      connectivity, non-local label assignment, and label range
      limitations on links. This document describes OSPF routing protocol
      extensions to support these kinds of constraints under the control
      of Generalized MPLS (GMPLS).

  Ruiquan Jing, Rakesh Gandhi, 2013-03-18,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-rsvpte-ext-associated-lsp-06.txt>

      The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) requirements document [RFC5654],
      describes that MPLS-TP MUST support associated bidirectional point-
      to-point LSPs.
      
      This document provides a method to bind two unidirectional Label
      Switched Paths (LSPs) into an associated bidirectional LSP.  The
      association is achieved by defining the new Association Types in the
      Extended ASSOCIATION object.

  "Revised Definition of The GMPLS Switching Capability and Type Fields",
  Lou Berger, Julien Meuric, 2013-04-17,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-swcaps-update-01.txt>

      GMPLS provides control for multiple switching technologies, and
      hierarchical switching within a technology.  GMPLS routing and
      signaling use common values to indicate switching technology type.
      These values are carried in routing in the Switching Capability
      field, and in signaling in the Switching Type field. While the
      values used in these fields are the primary indicators of the
      technology and hierarchy level being controlled, the values are
      not consistently defined and used across the different
      technologies supported by GMPLS.  This document is intended to
      resolve the inconsistent definition and use of the Switching
      Capability and Type fields by narrowly scoping the meaning and use
      of the fields.  This document updates any document that uses the
      GMPLS Switching Capability and Types fields, in particular RFC
      3471, RFC 4202, RFC 4203, and RFC 5307.

Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (cdni)
------------------------------------------------

  "Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) Requirements", Kent
  Leung, Yiu Lee, 2013-07-01, <draft-ietf-cdni-requirements-09.txt>

      Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are frequently used for content
      delivery.  As a result of significant growth in content delivered
      over IP networks, existing CDN providers are scaling up their
      infrastructure.  Many Network Service Providers and Enterprise
      Service Providers are also deploying their own CDNs.  To deliver
      contents from the Content Service Protect (CSP) to end users, the
      contents may traverse across multiple CDNs.  This creates a need for
      interconnecting (previously) standalone CDNs so that they can
      collectively act as a single delivery platform from the CSP to the
      end users.
      
      The goal of the present document is to outline the requirements for
      the solution and interfaces to be specified by the CDNI working
      group.

  "Framework for CDN Interconnection", Larry Peterson, Bruce Davie,
  2013-02-18, <draft-ietf-cdni-framework-03.txt,.pdf>

      This document presents a framework for Content Distribution Network
      Interconnection (CDNI).  The purpose of the framework is to provide
      an overall picture of the problem space of CDNI and to describe the
      relationships among the various components necessary to interconnect
      CDNs.  CDN Interconnection requires the specification of several
      interfaces and mechanisms to address issues such as request routing,
      distribution metadata exchange, and logging information exchange
      across CDNs.  The intent of this document is to outline what each
      interface needs to accomplish, and to describe how these interfaces
      and mechanisms fit together, while leaving their detailed
      specification to other documents.  It obsoletes RFC 3466.

  "CDN Interconnect Metadata", Ben Niven-Jenkins, Rob Murray, Grant
  Watson, Matt Caulfield, Kent Leung, Kevin Ma, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-cdni-metadata-02.txt>

      The CDNI Metadata Interface enables interconnected CDNs to exchange
      content distribution metadata in order to enable content acquisition
      and delivery.  The CDNI metadata associated with a piece of content
      provides a downstream CDN with sufficient information for the
      downstream CDN to service content requests on behalf of an upstream
      CDN.  This document describes both the core set of CDNI metadata and
      the protocol for exchanging that metadata.

  "CDNI Logging Interface", Francois Le Faucheur, Gilles Bertrand, Iuniana
  Oprescu, Roy Peterkofsky, 2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-cdni-logging-05.txt>

      This memo specifies the Logging interface between a downstream CDN
      (dCDN) and an upstream CDN (uCDN) that are interconnected as per the
      CDN Interconnection (CDNI) framework.  First, it describes a
      reference model for CDNI logging.  Then, it specifies the CDNI
      Logging File format and the actual protocol for exchange of CDNI
      Logging Files.

  "CDNI Control Interface / Triggers", Rob Murray, Ben Niven-Jenkins,
  2013-04-08, <draft-ietf-cdni-control-triggers-00.txt>

      This document describes the part of the CDN Interconnect Control
      Interface that allows a CDN to trigger activity in an interconnected
      CDN that is configured to deliver content on its behalf.  The
      upstream CDN can use this mechanism to request that the downstream
      CDN pre-positions metadata or content, or that it re-validate or
      purge metadata or content.  The upstream CDN can monitor the status
      of activity that it has triggered in the downstream CDN.

  "Request Routing Redirection Interface for CDN Interconnection", Wang
  Danhua, Ben Niven-Jenkins, Xiaoyan He, Ge Chen, Wei Ni, 2013-04-15,
  <draft-ietf-cdni-redirection-00.txt>

      The Request Routing Interface comprises of (1) the asynchronous
      advertisement of footprint and capabilities by a downstream CDN that
      allows a upstream CDN to decide whether to redirect particular user
      requests to that downstream CDN; and (2) the synchronous operation of
      an upstream CDN requesting whether a downstream CDN is prepared to
      accept a user request and of a downstream CDN responding with how to
      actually redirect the user request.  This document describes an
      interface for the latter part, i.e.  the CDNI request routing/
      Redirection Interface.

  "CDNI Request Routing: Footprint and Capabilities Semantics", Jan
  Seedorf, Jon Peterson, Stefano Previdi, Ray van Brandenburg, Kevin Ma,
  2013-07-17, <draft-ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics-00.txt>

      This document tries to capture the semantics of the "Footprint and
      Capabilities Advertisement" part of the CDNI Request Routing
      interface, i.e. the desired meaning and what "Footprint and
      Capabilities Advertisement" is expected to offer within CDNI.  The
      discussion in this document has the goal to facilitate the choosing
      of one or more suitable protocols for "Footprint and Capabilities
      Advertisement" within CDNI Request Routing.

ControLling mUltiple streams for tElepresence (clue)
----------------------------------------------------

  "Use Cases for Telepresence Multi-streams", Allyn Romanow, Stephen
  Botzko, Mark Duckworth, Roni Even, 2013-04-06,
  <draft-ietf-clue-telepresence-use-cases-05.txt>

      Telepresence conferencing systems seek to create the sense of really
      being present for the participants.  A number of techniques for
      handling audio and video streams are used to create this experience.
      When these techniques are not similar, interoperability between
      different systems is difficult at best, and often not possible.
      Conveying information about the relationships between multiple
      streams of media would allow senders and receivers to make choices to
      allow telepresence systems to interwork.  This memo describes the
      most typical and important use cases for sending multiple streams in
      a telepresence conference.

  "Requirements for Telepresence Multi-Streams", Allyn Romanow, Stephen
  Botzko, Mary Barnes, 2013-07-16,
  <draft-ietf-clue-telepresence-requirements-04.txt>

      This memo discusses the requirements for a specification that enables
      telepresence interoperability, by describing the relationship between
      multiple RTP streams.  In addition, the problem statement and
      definitions are also covered herein.

  "Framework for Telepresence Multi-Streams", Mark Duckworth, Andrew
  Pepperell, Stephan Wenger, 2013-07-14,

  Valin, Koen Vos, Jan Skoglund, 2013-05-17,
  <draft-ietf-codec-results-03.txt>

      This document describes and examines listening test results obtained
      for the Opus codec and how they relate to the requirements.

  "Ogg Encapsulation for the Opus Audio Codec", Timothy Terriberry, Ron
  Lee, Ralph Giles, 2013-05-24, <draft-ietf-codec-oggopus-01.txt>

      This document defines the Ogg encapsulation for the Opus interactive
      speech and audio codec.  This allows data encoded in the Opus format
      to be stored in an Ogg logical bitstream.  Ogg encapsulation provides
      Opus with a long-term storage format supporting all of the essential
      features, including metadata, fast and accurate seeking, corruption
      detection, recapture after errors, low overhead, and the ability to
      multiplex Opus with other codecs (including video) with minimal
      buffering.  It also provides a live streamable format, capable of
      delivery over a reliable stream-oriented transport, without requiring
      all the data, or even the total length of the data, up-front, in a
      form that is identical to the on-disk storage format.

Congestion Exposure (conex)
---------------------------

  "Congestion Exposure (ConEx) Concepts and Abstract Mechanism", Matt
  Mathis, Bob Briscoe, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-07.txt>

      This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders inform
      the network about the congestion encountered by packets earlier in
      the same flow.  Today, network elements at any layer may signal
      congestion to the receiver by dropping packets or by ECN markings,
      and the receiver passes this information back to the sender in
      transport-layer feedback.  The mechanism described here enables the
      sender to also relay this congestion information back into the
      network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total amount of
      congestion from all elements on the path is revealed to all IP
      elements along the path, where it could, for example, be used to
      provide input to traffic management.  This mechanism is called
      congestion exposure or ConEx.  The companion document "ConEx Concepts
      and Use Cases" provides the entry-point to the set of ConEx
      documentation.

  "IPv6 Destination Option for ConEx", Suresh Krishnan, Mirja Kuehlewind,
  Carlos Ucendo, 2013-03-28, <draft-ietf-conex-destopt-04.txt>

      ConEx is a mechanism by which senders inform the network about the
      congestion encountered by packets earlier in the same flow.  This
      document specifies an IPv6 destination option that is capable of
      carrying ConEx markings in IPv6 datagrams.

  "TCP modifications for Congestion Exposure", Mirja Kuehlewind, Richard
  Scheffenegger, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-conex-tcp-modifications-04.txt>

      Congestion Exposure (ConEx) is a mechanism by which senders inform
      the network about the congestion encountered by previous packets on
      the same flow.  This document describes the necessary modifications
      to use ConEx with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

  "Mobile Communication Congestion Exposure Scenario", Dirk Kutscher,
  Faisal Mir, Rolf Winter, Suresh Krishnan, Ying Zhang, Carlos Bernardos,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-conex-mobile-02.txt>

      This memo describes a mobile communications use case for congestion
      exposure (CONEX) with a particular focus on mobile communication
      networks such as the 3GPP Evolved Packet System (EPS).  The draft
      provides a brief overview of the architecture of these networks (both
      access and core networks), current QoS mechanisms and then discusses
      how congestion exposure concepts could be applied.  Based on this,
      this memo suggests a set of requirements for CONEX mechanisms that
      particularly apply to mobile networks.

Constrained RESTful Environments (core)
---------------------------------------

  "Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)", Zach Shelby, Klaus Hartke,
  Carsten Bormann, 2013-06-28, <draft-ietf-core-coap-18.txt>

      The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web
      transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained
      (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks.  The nodes often have 8-bit
      microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained
      networks such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error rates and a
      typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s.  The protocol is designed for
      machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and
      building automation.
      
      CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between
      application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and
      resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and
      Internet media types.  CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP
      for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements
      such as multicast support, very low overhead and simplicity for
      constrained environments.

  "Blockwise transfers in CoAP", Carsten Bormann, Zach Shelby, 2013-06-27,
  <draft-ietf-core-block-12.txt>

      CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and
      networks.  Basic CoAP messages work well for the small payloads we
      expect from temperature sensors, light switches, and similar
      building-automation devices.  Occasionally, however, applications
      will need to transfer larger payloads -- for instance, for firmware
      updates.  With HTTP, TCP does the grunt work of slicing large
      payloads up into multiple packets and ensuring that they all arrive
      and are handled in the right order.
      
      CoAP is based on datagram transports such as UDP or DTLS, which
      limits the maximum size of resource representations that can be
      transferred without too much fragmentation.  Although UDP supports
      larger payloads through IP fragmentation, it is limited to 64 KiB
      and, more importantly, doesn't really work well for constrained
      applications and networks.
      
      Instead of relying on IP fragmentation, this specification extends
      basic CoAP with a pair of "Block" options, for transferring multiple
      blocks of information from a resource representation in multiple
      request-response pairs.  In many important cases, the Block options
      enable a server to be truly stateless: the server can handle each
      block transfer separately, with no need for a connection setup or
      other server-side memory of previous block transfers.
      
      In summary, the Block options provide a minimal way to transfer
      larger representations in a block-wise fashion.
      
      The present revision -11 fixes one example and adds the text and
      examples about the Block/Observe interaction, taken from -observe.
      It also adds a couple of formatting bugs from the new xml2rfc.  The
      "grand rewrite" is next.

  "Observing Resources in CoAP", Klaus Hartke, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-core-observe-09.txt>

      CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and
      networks.  The state of a resource on a CoAP server can change over
      time.  This document specifies a simple protocol extension for CoAP
      that enables CoAP clients to "observe" resources, i.e., to retrieve
      a representation of a resource and keep this representation updated
      by the server over a period of time.  The protocol follows a best-
      effort approach for sending new representations to clients, and
      provides eventual consistency between the state observed by each
      client and the actual resource state at the server.

  "Group Communication for CoAP", Akbar Rahman, Esko Dijk, 2013-07-30,
  <draft-ietf-core-groupcomm-12.txt>

      CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained devices and
      constrained networks.  It is anticipated that constrained devices
      will often naturally operate in groups (e.g., in a building
      automation scenario all lights in a given room may need to be
      switched on/off as a group).  This document provides guidance for how
      the CoAP protocol should be used in a group communication context.
      An approach for using CoAP on top of IP multicast is detailed.  Also,
      various use cases and corresponding protocol flows are provided to
      illustrate important concepts.  Finally, guidance is provided for
      deployment in various network topologies.

  "Representing CoRE Link Collections in JSON", Carsten Bormann,
  2013-06-02, <draft-ietf-core-links-json-00.txt>

      Web Linking (RFC5988) provides a way to represent links between Web
      resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes
      of such a link.  In constrained networks, a collection of Web links
      can be exchanged in the CoRE link format (RFC6690).  Outside of
      constrained environments, it may be useful to represent these
      collections of Web links in JSON format (RFC4627).
      
      This specification defines a common format for representing Web links
      in JSON format.

  "CoRE Resource Directory", Zach Shelby, Srdjan Krco, Carsten Bormann,
  2013-06-03, <draft-ietf-core-resource-directory-00.txt>

      In many M2M applications, direct discovery of resources is not
      practical due to sleeping nodes, disperse networks, or networks where
      multicast traffic is inefficient.  These problems can be solved by
      employing an entity called a Resource Directory (RD), which hosts
      descriptions of resources held on other servers, allowing lookups to
      be performed for those resources.  This document specifies the web
      interfaces that a Resource Directory supports in order for web
      servers to discover the RD and to register, maintain, lookup and
      remove resources descriptions.  Furthermore, new link attributes
      useful in conjunction with an RD are defined.

  "CoRE Interfaces", Zach Shelby, Matthieu Vial, 2013-06-03,
  <draft-ietf-core-interfaces-00.txt>

      This document defines well-known REST interface descriptions for
      Batch, Sensor, Parameter and Actuator types for use in contrained web
      servers using the CoRE Link Format.  A short reference is provided
      for each type that can be efficiently included in the interface
      description attribute of the CoRE Link Format.  These descriptions
      are intended to be for general use in resource designs or for
      inclusion in more specific interface profiles.  In addition, this
      document defines the concepts of Function Set and Binding.  The
      former is the basis element to create RESTful profiles and the latter
      helps the configuration of links between resources located on one or
      more endpoints.

  "Best Practices for HTTP-CoAP Mapping Implementation", Angelo
  Castellani, Salvatore Loreto, Akbar Rahman, Thomas Fossati, Esko Dijk,
  2013-07-03, <draft-ietf-core-http-mapping-01.txt>

      This draft provides reference information for HTTP-CoAP protocol
      translation proxy implementors, focusing primarily on the reverse
      proxy case.  It details deployment options, discusses possible
      approaches for URI mapping, and provides a set of guidelines and
      considerations related to protocol translation.

Call Control UUI Service for SIP (cuss)
---------------------------------------

  "A Mechanism for Transporting User to User Call Control Information in
  SIP", Alan Johnston, James Rafferty, 2013-04-09,
  <draft-ietf-cuss-sip-uui-10.txt>

      There is a class of applications which benefit from using SIP to
      exchange User to User Information (UUI) data during session
      establishment.  This information, known as call control UUI data, is
      a small piece of data inserted by an application initiating the
      session, and utilized by an application accepting the session.  The
      rules which apply for a specific application are defined by a UUI
      package.  This UUI data is opaque to SIP and its function is
      unrelated to any basic SIP function.  This document defines a new SIP
      header field, User-to-User, to transport UUI data, along with an
      extension mechanism.

  "Interworking ISDN Call Control User Information with SIP", Keith Drage,
  Alan Johnston, 2013-08-04, <draft-ietf-cuss-sip-uui-isdn-05.txt>

      The motivation and use cases for interworking and transporting ITU-T
      DSS1 User-user information element data in SIP are described in the
      "Problem Statement and Requirements for Transporting User to User
      Call Control Information in SIP" document.  As networks move to SIP
      it is important that applications requiring this data can continue to
      function in SIP networks as well as the ability to interwork with
      this ISDN service for end-to- end transparency.  This document
      defines a usage (a new package) of the User-to-User header field to
      enable interworking with this ISDN service.
      
      This document covers the interworking with both public ISDN and
      private ISDN capabilities, so the potential interworking with QSIG
      will also be addressed.
      
      The package is identified by a new value "isdn-uui" of the "purpose"
      header field parameter.

DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (dane)
-------------------------------------------------

  "Using Secure DNS to Associate Certificates with Domain Names For
  S/MIME", Paul Hoffman, Jakob Schlyter, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-ietf-dane-smime-02.txt>

      This document describes how to use secure DNS to associate an S/MIME
      user's certificate with the intended domain name, similar to the way
      that DANE (RFC 6698) does for TLS.

  "Secure SMTP using DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)
  TLSA records.", Tony Finch, 2013-02-25, <draft-ietf-dane-smtp-01.txt>

      SMTP has a STARTTLS extension, but (especially in the case of inter-
      domain mail transfer) it only provides very limited security because
      it does not specify how to authenticate the server's certificate.
      This memo specifies how TLSA records in the DNS can be used for
      proper SMTP server authentication.

  "Using DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) TLSA records
  with SRV and MX records.", Tony Finch, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-dane-srv-02.txt>

      The DANE specification [RFC6698] describes how to use TLSA resource
      records in the DNS to associate a server's host name with its TLS
      certificate.  The association is secured with DNSSEC.  Some
      application protocols can use SRV records [RFC2782] to indirectly
      name the server hosts for a service domain.  (SMTP uses MX records
      for the same purpose.)  This specification gives generic instructions
      for how these application protocols locate and use TLSA records.
      Separate documents give the details that are specific to particular
      application protocols.

Dynamic Host Configuration (dhc)
--------------------------------

  "Guidelines for Creating New DHCPv6 Options", David Hankins, Tomek
  Mrugalski, Marcin Siodelski, Sheng Jiang, Suresh Krishnan, 2013-07-30,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-option-guidelines-13.txt>

      This document provides guidance to prospective DHCPv6 Option
      developers to help them creating option formats that are easily
      adoptable by existing DHCPv6 software.  This document updates
      RFC3315.

  "Container Option for Server Configuration", Ralph Droms, Reinaldo
  Penno, 2013-04-08, <draft-ietf-dhc-container-opt-07.txt>

      In some DHCP service deployments, it is desirable for a DHCP server
      in one administrative domain to pass configuration options to a DHCP
      server in a different administrative domain.  This DHCP option
      carries a set of DHCP options that can be used by another DHCP
      server.

  "Prefix Assignment in DHCPv6", Sheng Jiang, Frank Xia, Behcet Sarikaya,
  2013-02-25, <draft-ietf-dhc-host-gen-id-05.txt>

      This document introduces a generic host-oriented prefix assignment
      mechanism using DHCPv6.  In this new address configuration procedure,
      the prefix is assigned from a DHCPv6 server to hosts through DHCPv6
      message exchanging while the interface identifiers are independently
      generated by the hosts.  It enables both integral address assignment
      and self-generated addresses in one single mechanism, DHCPv6.  It
      also enables stateless address configuration without RA attendance.
      The technique described in this document can be used in networks
      which assign IPv6 addresses using DHCPv6, e.g.  WiMAX.

  "DHCPv6 Failover Requirements", Tomek Mrugalski, Kim Kinnear,
  2013-07-19, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-requirements-07.txt>

      The DHCPv6 protocol, defined in [RFC3315] allows for multiple servers
      to operate on a single network, however it does not define any way
      the servers could share information about currently active clients
      and their leases.  Some sites are interested in running multiple
      servers in such a way as to provide increased availability in case of
      server failure.  In order for this to work reliably, the cooperating
      primary and secondary servers must maintain a consistent database of
      the lease information.  [RFC3315] allows for but does not define any
      redundancy or failover mechanisms.  This document outlines
      requirements for DHCPv6 failover, enumerates related problems, and
      discusses the proposed scope of work to be conducted.  This document
      does not define a DHCPv6 failover protocol.

  "DHCPv4 over IPv6 Transport", Yong Cui, Peng Wu, Jianping Wu, Ted Lemon,
  2013-03-20, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6-06.txt>

      In IPv6 networks, there remains a need to provide IPv4 service for
      some residual devices.  This document describes a mechanism for
      allocating IPv4 addresses to such devices, using DHCPv4 with an IPv6
      transport.  It is done by putting a special relay agent function
      (Client Relay Agent) on the client side, as well as extending the
      behavior of the server; in the case where DHCP server only supports
      IPv4 transport, a relay agent is extended to support IPv6 transport
      (IPv6-Transport Relay Agent) and relay DHCP traffic for the server,
      with a new Relay Agent Information sub-option added to carry the IPv6
      address of the Client Relay Agent.

  "RADIUS Option for DHCPv6 Relay Agent",  leaf.yeh.sdo@gmail.com, Mohamed
  Boucadair, 2013-07-29, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-radius-opt-14.txt>

      The DHCPv6 RADIUS option provides a mechanism to exchange
      authorization and identification information between DHCPv6 relay
      agent and DHCPv6 server.  This architecture assumes that the Network
      Access Server(NAS) acts as both DHCPv6 relay agent and RADIUS client.
      When receiving messages from the DHCPv6 clients, the NAS consults the
      RADIUS server and adds the RADIUS response when forwarding the DHCPv6
      client's messages to the DHCPv6 server.  The DHCPv6 server then uses
      that additional information to generate appropriate response to the
      DHCPv6 client's requests.

  "Issues with multiple stateful DHCPv6 options", Ole Troan, Bernie Volz,
  2013-05-13, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-stateful-issues-04.txt>

      Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) was not written
      with the expectation that additional stateful DHCPv6 options would be
      developed.  IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration
      Protocol (DHCP) version 6 shoe-horned the new options for Prefix
      Delegation into DHCPv6.  Implementation experience of the CPE model
      described in [RFC6204] has shown multiple issues with the DHCPv6
      protocol in supporting multiple stateful options.

  "A Generic IPv6 Addresses Registration Solution Using DHCPv6", Sheng
  Jiang, Gang Chen, Suresh Krishnan, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-addr-registration-02.txt>

      In networks that are centrally managed, self-generated addresses
      cause traceability issues due to their decentralized nature.  To
      minimize the issues due to lack of traceability, these self-generated
      addresses can be registered with the network for allowing centralized
      address administration.  This document defines a generic address
      registration solution using DHCPv6, using a new ND option and a new
      DHCPv6 option in order to communicate the use of self-generated
      addresses.  A new Addr-registration-request message type is defined
      for initiate the address registration request, among with two new
      Status codes to indicate registration errors on the server side.

  "DHCPv6 Failover Design", Tomek Mrugalski, Kim Kinnear, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-design-03.txt>

      DHCPv6 defined in [RFC3315] does not offer server redundancy.  This
      document defines a design for DHCPv6 failover, a mechanism for
      running two servers on the same network with capability for either
      server to take over clients' leases in case of server failure or
      network partition.  This is a DHCPv6 Failover design document, it is
      not protocol specification document.  It is a second document in a
      planned series of three documents.  DHCPv6 failover requirements are
      specified in [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-requirements].  A protocol
      specification document is planned to follow this document.

  "Prefix Pool Option for DHCPv6 Relay Agent on the Provider Edge
  Routers",  leaf.yeh.sdo@gmail.com, Ted Lemon, Mohamed Boucadair,
  2013-04-25, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-prefix-pool-opt-03.txt>

      The DHCPv6 Prefix Pool option provides a mechanism for DHCPv6 Prefix
      Delegation (DHCPv6-PD), allowing the DHCPv6 server to notify a DHCPv6
      relay agent implemented on a Provider Edge (PE) router about active
      prefix pools allocated by the DHCPv6 server to the PE router.  The
      information of active prefix pools can be used to enforce IPv6 route
      aggregation on the PE router through adding or removing aggregation
      routes according to the status of the prefix pools.  The advertising
      of the aggregation routes in the routing protocol enabled on the
      network-facing interface of PE routers will dramatically decreases
      the number of the routing table entries in the ISP network.

  "Modification to Default Values of SOL_MAX_RT and INF_MAX_RT", Ralph
  Droms, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-solmaxrt-update-02.txt>

      This document updates RFC 3315 by redefining the default values for
      SOL_MAX_RT and INF_MAX_RT, and defining options through which a
      DHCPv6 server can override the client's default value for SOL_MAX_RT
      and INF_MAX_RT with a new value.

  "Populating the DNS Reverse Tree for DHCP Delegated Prefixes", Ted
  Lemon, 2013-03-11, <draft-ietf-dhc-dns-pd-00.txt>

      This document describes three alternatives for populating the DNS
      reverse tree for prefixes delegated using DHCP, and provides
      mechanisms for implementing each alternative.

  "Customizing DHCP Configuration on the Basis of Network Topology", Ted
  Lemon, 2013-04-13, <draft-lemon-dhc-topo-conf-01.txt>

      DHCP servers have evolved over the years to provide significant
      functionality beyond that which is described in the DHCP base
      specifications.  One aspect of this functionality is support for
      context-specific configuration information.  This memo describes some
      such features and makes recommendations as to how they can be used.

  "Handling Unknown DHCPv6 Messages", Yong Cui, Qi Sun, Ted Lemon,
  2013-06-26, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-unknown-msg-01.txt>

      Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) isn't specific
      about handling messages with unknown types.  This memo describes the
      problems and defines how a DHCPv6 function node should behave in this
      case.  This document updates RFC3315.

  "DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Transport", Qi Sun, Yong Cui, Marcin Siodelski,
  Suresh Krishnan, Ian Farrer, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6-01.txt>

      This document describes a mechanism for obtaining IPv4 address and
      other parameters in IPv6 networks by carrying DHCPv4 messages over
      DHCPv6 transport.

  "Provisioning IPv4 Configuration Over IPv6 Only Networks", Branimir
  Rajtar, Ian Farrer, 2013-05-28, <draft-ietf-dhc-v4configuration-01.txt>

      As IPv6 becomes more widely adopted, some service providers are
      taking the approach of deploying IPv6 only networks, without dual-
      stack functionality for IPv4.  However, access to IPv4 based services
      is still an ongoing requirement and approaches such as IPv4-in-IPv6
      softwire tunnels are being developed to meet this need.
      
      In order to provision end-user's hosts with the necessary IPv4
      configuration, a number of different mechanisms have been proposed.
      This memo discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each, with the aim
      of recommending a single approach as the basis for future work.

  "Access-Network-Identifier Option in DHCP", Cisco Systems, Sri
  Gundavelli, Jouni Korhonen, Mark Grayson, 2013-05-14,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-access-network-identifier-00.txt>

      This document specifies the format and mechanism that is to be used
      for encoding access network identifiers in DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 messages
      by defining new access network identifier options and sub-options.

Diameter Maintenance and Extensions (dime)
------------------------------------------

  "Diameter Applications Design Guidelines", Lionel Morand, Victor
  Fajardo, Hannes Tschofenig, 2013-06-26,
  <draft-ietf-dime-app-design-guide-19.txt>

      The Diameter base protocol provides facilities for protocol
      extensibility enabling to define new Diameter applications or modify
      existing applications.  This document is a companion document to the
      Diameter Base protocol that further explains and clarifies the rules
      to extend Diameter.  It is meant as a guidelines document and
      therefore as informative in nature.

  "Realm-Based Redirection In Diameter", Tina Tsou, Ruibing Hao, Tom
  Taylor, 2013-08-05, <draft-ietf-dime-realm-based-redirect-11.txt>

      Message redirection is a basic capability provided by the Diameter
      base protocol.  In its conventional form, message redirection is
      performed by an application-independent "redirect agent", which
      returns one or more individual hosts to the message sender as
      possible destinations of the redirected message.
      
      However, in some circumstances an operator may wish to redirect
      messages to an alternate domain without specifying individual hosts.
      This document specifies an application-specific mechanism by which
      that can be achieved.  New applications may incorporate this
      capability by reference to the present document.
      
      Because the redirection mechanism is application-specific, it must be
      performed by a Diameter server or proxy rather than a basic redirect
      agent as defined in the Diameter base protocol.  A new term, "Realm-
      based Redirect Server", is introduced in this document to
      differentiate the application-specific nature of realm-based
      redirection from the conventional Diameter redirection performed by a
      basic redirect agent.
      
      This memo updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of RFC6733 with respect to
      the usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time
      AVPs.

  "Diameter Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6 Localized Routing", Glen Zorn,
  Wenson Wu, Jouni Korhonen, 2012-08-01, <draft-ietf-dime-pmip6-lr-18.txt>

      In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the
      Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically
      tunneled to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing.  The term
      "localized routing" refers to a method by which packets are routed
      directly between an MN's MAG and the MAG of its Correspondent Node
      (CN) without involving any LMA.  In a Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployment,
      it may be desirable to control the establishment of localized routing
      sessions between two MAGs in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain by requiring
      that the session be authorized.  This document specifies how to
      accomplish this using the Diameter protocol.

  "Diameter Network Access Server Application", Glen Zorn, 2013-05-13,
  <draft-ietf-dime-rfc4005bis-13.txt>

      This document describes the Diameter protocol application used for
      Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) services in the
      Network Access Server (NAS) environment; it obsoletes RFC 4005.  When
      combined with the Diameter Base protocol, Transport Profile, and
      Extensible Authentication Protocol specifications, this application
      specification satisfies typical network access services requirements.

  "Diameter Group Signaling", Mark Jones, Marco Liebsch, Lionel Morand,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-dime-group-signaling-01.txt>

      In large network deployments, a single Diameter peer can support over
      a million concurrent Diameter sessions.  Recent use cases have
      revealed the need for Diameter peers to apply the same operation to a
      large group of Diameter sessions concurrently.  The Diameter base
      protocol commands operate on a single session so these use cases
      could result in many thousands of command exchanges to enforce the
      same operation on each session in the group.  In order to reduce
      signaling, it would be desirable to enable bulk operations on all (or
      part of) the sessions managed by a Diameter peer using a single or a
      few command exchanges.  This document specifies the Diameter protocol
      extensions to achieve this signaling optimization.

  "Diameter Overload Control Requirements", Eric McMurry, Ben Campbell,
  2013-07-28, <draft-ietf-dime-overload-reqs-10.txt>

      When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be
      able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to
      reduce sending traffic for some period of time.  Otherwise, it must
      continue to expend resources parsing and responding to Diameter
      messages, possibly resulting in congestion collapse.  The existing
      Diameter mechanisms, listed in Section 4 are not sufficient for this
      purpose.  This document describes the limitations of the existing
      mechanisms in Section 5.  Requirements for new overload management
      mechanisms are provided in Section 7.

Distributed Mobility Management (dmm)
-------------------------------------

  "Requirements for Distributed Mobility Management", Anthony Chan, Dapeng
  Liu, Pierrick Seite, Hidetoshi Yokota, Jouni Korhonen, 2013-08-02,
  <draft-ietf-dmm-requirements-07.txt,.pdf>

      This document defines the requirements for Distributed Mobility
      Management (DMM) in IPv6 deployments.  The hierarchical structure in
      traditional wireless networks has led to deployment models which are
      in practice centralized.  Mobility management with logically
      centralized mobility anchoring in current mobile networks is prone to
      suboptimal routing and raises scalability issues.  Such centralized
      functions can lead to single points of failure and inevitably
      introduce longer delays and higher signaling loads for network
      operations related to mobility management.  The objective is to
      enhance mobility management in order to meet the primary goals in
      network evolution, i.e., improve scalability, avoid single points of
      failure, enable transparent mobility support to upper layers only
      when needed, and so on.  Distributed mobility management must be
      secure and may co-exist with existing network deployments and end
      hosts.

  "Distributed Mobility Management: Current practices and gap analysis",
  Dapeng Liu, Juan Zuniga, Pierrick Seite, Anthony Chan, Carlos Bernardos,
  2013-06-17, <draft-ietf-dmm-best-practices-gap-analysis-01.txt>

      The present document analyses deplyment practices of existing
      mobility protocols in a distributed mobility management environment.
      It also identifies some limitations compared to the expected
      functionality of a fully distributed mobility management system.  The
      comparison is made taking into account the identified DMM
      requirements.

Domain Name System Operations (dnsop)
-------------------------------------

  "Initializing a DNS Resolver with Priming Queries", Peter Koch, Matt
  Larson, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-dnsop-resolver-priming-03.txt>

      This document describes the initial queries a DNS resolver is
      supposed to emit to initialize its cache with a current NS RRSet for
      the root zone as well as the necessary address information.

Data for Reachability of Inter/tra-NetworK SIP (drinks)
-------------------------------------------------------

  "Session Peering Provisioning (SPP) Protocol over SOAP", Kenneth
  Cartwright, Vikas Bhatia, Jean-Francois Mule, Alexander Mayrhofer,
  2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-drinks-spp-protocol-over-soap-04.txt>

      The Session Peering Provisioning Framework (SPPF) specifies the data
      model and the overall structure to provision session establishment
      data into Session Data Registries and SIP Service Provider data
      stores.  To utilize this framework one needs a transport protocol.
      Given that Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is currently widely
      used for messaging between elements of such provisioning systems,
      this document specifies the usage of SOAP (via HTTPS) as the
      transport protocol for SPPF.  The benefits include leveraging
      prevalent expertise, and a higher probability that existing
      provisioning systems will be able to easily migrate to using an SPPF
      based protocol.

  "Session Peering Provisioning Framework (SPPF)", Kenneth Cartwright,
  Vikas Bhatia, Syed Ali, David Schwartz, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-drinks-spp-framework-05.txt>

      This document specifies the data model and the overall structure for
      a framework to provision session establishment data into Session Data
      Registries and SIP Service Provider data stores.  The framework is
      called the Session Peering Provisioning Framework (SPPF).  The
      provisioned data is typically used by network elements for session
      establishment.

Emergency Context Resolution with Internet Technologies (ecrit)
---------------------------------------------------------------

  "Trustworthy Location", Hannes Tschofenig, Henning Schulzrinne, Bernard
  Aboba, 2013-07-30, <draft-ietf-ecrit-trustworthy-location-07.txt>

      For some location-based applications, such as emergency calling or
      roadside assistance, the trustworthiness of location information is
      critically important.
      
      This document describes how to convey location in a manner that is
      inherently secure and reliable.  It also provides guidelines for
      assessing the trustworthiness of location information.

  "Extensions to the Emergency Services Architecture for dealing with
  Unauthenticated and Unauthorized Devices", Henning Schulzrinne, Stephen
  McCann, Gabor Bajko, Hannes Tschofenig, Dirk Kroeselberg, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-ietf-ecrit-unauthenticated-access-07.txt>

      The IETF emergency services architecture assumes that the calling
      device has acquired rights to use the access network or that no
      authentication is required for the access network, such as for public
      wireless access points.  Subsequent protocol interactions, such as
      obtaining location information, learning the address of the Public
      Safety Answering Point (PSAP) and the emergency call itself are
      largely decoupled from the underlying network access procedures.
      
      In some cases, however, the device does not have these credentials
      for network access, does not have a VoIP service provider, or the
      credentials have become invalid, e.g., because the user has exhausted
      their prepaid balance or the account has expired.
      
      This document provides a problem statement, introduces terminology
      and describes an extension for the base IETF emergency services
      architecture to address these scenarios.

  "Data-Only Emergency Calls", Brian Rosen, Henning Schulzrinne, Hannes
  Tschofenig, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-ecrit-data-only-ea-06.txt>

      RFC 6443 'Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia'
      describes how devices use the Internet to place emergency calls and
      how Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) can handle Internet
      multimedia emergency calls natively.  The exchange of multimedia
      traffic typically involves a SIP session establishment starting with
      a SIP INVITE that negotiates various parameters for that session.
      
      In some cases, however, the transmission of application data is
      everything that is needed.  Examples of such environments include a
      temperature sensors issuing alerts, or vehicles sending crash data.
      Often these alerts are conveyed as one-shot data transmissions.
      These type of interactions are called 'data-only emergency calls'.
      This document describes a container for the data based on the Common
      Alerting Protocol (CAP) and its transmission using the SIP MESSAGE
      transaction.

  "Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) Callback", Henning Schulzrinne,
  Hannes Tschofenig, Christer Holmberg, Milan Patel, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-ietf-ecrit-psap-callback-10.txt>

      After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated
      by the emergency caller or normally by the call taker) it is possible
      that the call taker feels the need for further communication.  For
      example, the call may have been dropped by accident without the call
      taker having sufficient information about the current situation of a
      wounded person.  A call taker may trigger a callback towards the
      emergency caller using the contact information provided with the
      initial emergency call.  This callback could, under certain
      circumstances, be treated like any other call and as a consequence it
      may get blocked by authorization policies or may get forwarded to an
      answering machine.
      
      The IETF emergency services architecture specification already offers
      a solution approach for allowing PSAP callbacks to bypass
      authorization policies to reach the caller without unnecessary
      delays.  Unfortunately, the specified mechanism only supports limited
      scenarios.  This document discusses shortcomings of the current
      mechanisms and illustrates additional scenarios where better-than-
      normal call treatment behavior would be desirable.  A solution based
      on a new header field value, called "psap-callback", for the SIP
      Priority header field is specified to accomplish the PSAP callback
      marking.

  "Additional Data related to an Emergency Call", Brian Rosen, Hannes
  Tschofenig, Roger Marshall, Randy, James Winterbottom, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-ietf-ecrit-additional-data-11.txt>

      When an emergency call is sent to a Public Safety Answering Point
      (PSAP), the device that sends it, as well as any application service
      provider in the path of the call, or access network provider through
      which the call originated may have information about the call, the
      caller or the location which the PSAP may be able to use.  This
      document describes data structures and a mechanism to convey such
      data to the PSAP.  The mechanism uses a Uniform Resource Identifier
      (URI), which may point to either an external resource or an object in
      the body of the SIP message.  The mechanism thus allows the data to
      be passed by reference (when the URI points to an external resource)
      or by value (when it points into the body of the message).  This
      follows the tradition of prior emergency services standardization
      work where data can be conveyed by value within the call signaling
      (i.e., in body of the SIP message) and also by reference.

  "Policy for defining new service-identifying lables", Andrea Forte,
  Henning Schulzrinne, 2013-06-20,
  <draft-ietf-ecrit-service-urn-policy-02.txt>

      In order to provide location-based services, descriptive terms for
      services need to be defined.  This document updates the policy for
      defining new service-identifying labels.

  "URN For Country Specific Emergency Services", Christer Holmberg, Ivo
  Sedlacek, 2013-04-29, <draft-ietf-ecrit-country-emg-urn-00.txt>

      This document updates section 4.2 of RFC 5031, in order to allow the
      registration of service URNs with the 'sos' service type for
      emergency services that, at the time of registration, are offered in
      one country only.

Energy Management (eman)
------------------------

  "Requirements for Energy Management", Juergen Quittek, Mouli
  Chandramouli, Rolf Winter, Thomas Dietz, Benoit Claise, 2013-05-02,
  <draft-ietf-eman-requirements-14.txt>

      This document defines requirements for standards specifications for
      energy management.  The requirements defined in this document concern
      monitoring functions as well as control functions.  Monitoring
      functions include identification of energy-managed devices and their
      components, monitoring of their power states, power inlets, power
      outlets, actual power (the instantaneous power, as opposed to the
      demand, which is an averaged power), power attributes, received
      energy, provided energy, and contained batteries.  Control functions
      serve for controlling power supply and power state of energy-managed
      devices and their components.
      This document does not specify the features that must be implemented
      by compliant implementations but rather features that must be
      supported by standards for energy management.

  "Energy Management Framework", Benoit Claise, John Parello, Brad
  Schoening, Juergen Quittek, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-ietf-eman-framework-08.txt>

      This document defines a framework for providing Energy
      Management for devices and device components within or
      connected to communication networks.  The framework defines an
      Energy Management Domain as a set of Energy Objects. Each
      Energy Object is identified, classified and given context.
      Energy Objects can be monitored and controlled with respect to
      Power, Power State, Energy, Demand, Power Attributes, and
      Battery.  Additionally the framework models relationships and
      capabilities between Energy Objects.

  "Energy Object Context MIB", John Parello, Benoit Claise, Mouli
  Chandramouli, 2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-eman-energy-aware-mib-09.txt>

      This document defines a subset of a Management Information Base
      (MIB) for energy management of devices. The module addresses
      device identification, context information, and the
      relationships between reporting devices, remote devices, and
      monitoring devices.

  "Definition of Managed Objects for Battery Monitoring", Juergen Quittek,
  Rolf Winter, Thomas Dietz, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-eman-battery-mib-09.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
      In particular, it defines managed objects that provide information on
      the status of batteries in managed devices.

  "Power and Energy Monitoring MIB", Mouli Chandramouli, Brad Schoening,
  Juergen Quittek, Thomas Dietz, Benoit Claise, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-eman-energy-monitoring-mib-06.txt>

      This document defines a subset of the Management Information
      Base (MIB) for power and energy monitoring of devices.

  "Energy Management (EMAN) Applicability Statement", Brad Schoening,
  Mouli Chandramouli, Bruce Nordman, 2013-04-18,
  <draft-ietf-eman-applicability-statement-03.txt>

      The objective of Energy Management (EMAN) is to provide an
      energy management framework for networked devices.  This
      document presents the applicability of the EMAN framework to a
      variety of scenarios.  This document lists use cases and target
      devices that can potentially implement the EMAN framework and
      associated SNMP MIB modules.  These use cases are useful for
      identifying requirements for the framework and MIBs.  Further,
      we describe the relationship of the EMAN framework to relevant
      other energy monitoring standards and architectures.

EAP Method Update (emu)
-----------------------

  "Tunnel EAP Method (TEAP) Version 1", Hao Zhou, Nancy Cam-Winget, Joseph
  Salowey, Stephen Hanna, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-emu-eap-tunnel-method-07.txt>

      This document defines the Tunnel Extensible Authentication Protocol
      (TEAP) version 1.  TEAP is a tunnel based EAP method that enables
      secure communication between a peer and a server by using the
      Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to establish a mutually
      authenticated tunnel.  Within the tunnel, Type-Length-Value (TLV)
      objects are used to convey authentication related data between the
      EAP peer and the EAP server.

  "EAP Mutual Cryptographic Binding", Sam Hartman, Margaret Wasserman,
  Dacheng Zhang, 2013-07-10, <draft-ietf-emu-crypto-bind-04.txt>

      As the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) evolves, EAP peers
      rely increasingly on information received from the EAP server.  EAP
      extensions such as channel binding or network posture information are
      often carried in tunnel methods; peers are likely to rely on this
      information.  RFC 3748 is a facility that protects tunnel methods
      against man-in-the-middle attacks.  However, cryptographic binding
      focuses on protecting the server rather than the peer.  This memo
      explores attacks possible when the peer is not protected from man-in-
      the-middle attacks and recommends mutual cryptographic binding, a new
      form of cryptographic binding that protects both peer and server
      along with other mitigations.

Forwarding and Control Element Separation (forces)
--------------------------------------------------

  "ForCES Intra-NE High Availability", Kentaro Ogawa, Weiming Wang,
  Evangelos Haleplidis, Jamal Hadi Salim, 2013-05-08,
  <draft-ietf-forces-ceha-07.txt>

      This document discusses Control Element High Availability within a
      ForCES Network Element.

Geographic Location/Privacy (geopriv)
-------------------------------------

  "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) IPv4 and IPv6 Option for a
  Location Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)", James Polk, 2013-02-24,
  <draft-ietf-geopriv-dhcp-lbyr-uri-option-19.txt>

      This document creates a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
      Option for transmitting a client's geolocation Uniform Resource
      Identifier (URI). This Location URI can then be dereferenced in a
      separate transaction by the client or sent to another entity and
      dereferenced to learn physically where the client is located, but
      only while valid.

  "Relative Location Representation", Martin Thomson, Brian Rosen, Dorothy
  Stanley, Gabor Bajko, Allan Thomson, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-geopriv-relative-location-06.txt>

      This document defines an extension to PIDF-LO (RFC4119) for the
      expression of location information that is defined relative to a
      reference point.  The reference point may be expressed as a geodetic
      or civic location, and the relative offset may be one of several
      shapes.  An alternative binary representation is described.
      
      Optionally, a reference to a secondary document (such as a map image)
      can be included, along with the relationship of the map coordinate
      system to the reference/offset coordinate system to allow display of
      the map with the reference point and the relative offset.

  "Using Device-provided Location-Related Measurements in Location
  Configuration Protocols", Martin Thomson, James Winterbottom,
  2013-06-24, <draft-ietf-geopriv-held-measurements-08.txt>

      This document describes a protocol for a Device to provide location-
      related measurement data to a Location Information Server (LIS)
      within a request for location information.  Location-related
      measurement information are observations concerning properties
      related to the position of a Device, which could be data about
      network attachment or about the physical environment.  A LIS is able
      to use the location-related measurement data to improve the accuracy
      of the location estimate it provides to the Device.  A basic set of
      location-related measurements are defined, including common modes of
      network attachment as well as assisted Global Navigation Satellite
      System (GNSS) parameters.

  "Location Configuration Extensions for Policy Management", Richard
  Barnes, Martin Thomson, James Winterbottom, Hannes Tschofenig,
  2012-10-04, <draft-ietf-geopriv-policy-uri-07.txt>

      Current location configuration protocols are capable of provisioning
      an Internet host with a location URI that refers to the host's
      location.  These protocols lack a mechanism for the target host to
      inspect or set the privacy rules that are applied to the URIs they
      distribute.  This document extends the current location configuration
      protocols to provide hosts with a reference to the rules that are
      applied to a URI, so that the host can view or set these rules.

  "Location Information Server (LIS) Discovery using IP address and
  Reverse DNS", Martin Thomson, Ray Bellis, 2013-04-05,
  <draft-ietf-geopriv-res-gw-lis-discovery-05.txt>

      The residential gateway is a device that has become an integral part
      of home networking equipment.  Discovering a Location Information
      Server (LIS) is a necessary part of acquiring location information
      for location-based services.  However, discovering a LIS when a
      residential gateway is present poses a configuration challenge,
      requiring a method that is able to work around the obstacle presented
      by the gateway.
      
      This document describes a solution to this problem.  The solution
      provides alternative domain names as input to the LIS discovery
      process based on the network addresses assigned to a Device.

Global Routing Operations (grow)
--------------------------------

  "Route-Leaks & MITM Attacks Against BGPSEC", Danny McPherson, Shane
  Amante, Eric Osterweil, Dave Mitchell, 2013-08-01,
  <draft-ietf-grow-simple-leak-attack-bgpsec-no-help-02.txt>

      This document describes a very simple attack vector that illustrates
      how RPKI-enabled BGPSEC machinery as currently defined can be easily
      circumvented in order to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack via
      BGP.  It is meant to serve as input to the IETF's Global Routing
      Operations Working group (GROW) during routing security requirements
      discussions and subsequent specification.

  "IRR & Routing Policy Configuration Considerations", Danny McPherson,
  Shane Amante, Eric Osterweil, Larry Blunk, Dave Mitchell, 2013-05-10,
  <draft-ietf-grow-irr-routing-policy-considerations-01.txt>

      The purpose of this document is to catalog past issues influencing
      the efficacy of Internet Routing Registries (IRR) for inter-domain
      routing policy specification and application in the global routing
      system over the past two decades.  Additionally, it provides a
      discussion regarding which of these issues are still problematic in
      practice, and which are simply artifacts that are no longer
      applicable but continue to stifle inter-provider policy-based
      filtering adoption and IRR utility to this day.

Host Identity Protocol (hip)
----------------------------

  "Host Identity Protocol-Based Overlay Networking Environment (HIP BONE)
  Instance Specification for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD)",
  Ari Keranen, Gonzalo Camarillo, Jouni Maenpaa, 2013-06-10,
  <draft-ietf-hip-reload-instance-08.txt>

      This document is the Host Identity Protocol-Based Overlay Networking
      Environment (HIP BONE) instance specification for the REsource
      LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) protocol.  The document provides the
      details needed to build a RELOAD-based overlay that uses HIP.

  "An IPv6 Prefix for Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers
  Version 2 (ORCHIDv2)", Julien Laganier, Francis Dupont, 2013-05-06,
  <draft-ietf-hip-rfc4843-bis-04.txt>

      This document specifies an updated Overlay Routable Cryptographic
      Hash Identifiers format that obsoletes the earlier format defined in
      [RFC4843].  These identifiers are intended to be used as endpoint
      identifiers at applications and Application Programming Interfaces
      (API) and not as identifiers for network location at the IP layer,
      i.e., locators.  They are designed to appear as application layer
      entities and at the existing IPv6 APIs, but they should not appear in
      actual IPv6 headers.  To make them more like regular IPv6 addresses,
      they are expected to be routable at an overlay level.  Consequently,
      while they are considered non-routable addresses from the IPv6 layer
      point-of-view, all existing IPv6 applications are expected to be able
      to use them in a manner compatible with current IPv6 addresses.
      
      The Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers originally
      defined in [RFC4843] lacked a mechanism for cryptographic algorithm
      agility.  The updated ORCHID format specified in this document
      removes this limitation by encoding in the identifier itself an index
      to the suite of cryptographic algorithms in use.

  "Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2)", Robert Moskowitz, Tobias
  Heer, Petri Jokela, Tom Henderson, 2013-06-30,
  <draft-ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis-12.txt>

      This document specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol
      (HIP).  HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and
      maintain shared IP-layer state, allowing separation of the identifier
      and locator roles of IP addresses, thereby enabling continuity of
      communications across IP address changes.  HIP is based on a SIGMA-
      compliant Diffie-Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers
      from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication.
      The protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS)
      and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  When used together with
      another suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulated Security
      Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional
      encryption for upper-layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.
      
      This document obsoletes RFC 5201 and addresses the concerns raised by
      the IESG, particularly that of crypto agility.  It also incorporates
      lessons learned from the implementations of RFC 5201.

  "Host Mobility with the Host Identity Protocol", Tom Henderson,
  Christian Vogt, Jari Arkko, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-hip-rfc5206-bis-06.txt>

      This document defines mobility extensions to the Host Identity
      Protocol (HIP).  Specifically, this document defines a general
      "LOCATOR_SET" parameter for HIP messages that allows for a HIP host
      to notify peers about alternate addresses at which it may be reached.
      This document also defines elements of procedure for mobility of a
      HIP host -- the process by which a host dynamically changes the
      primary locator that it uses to receive packets.  While the same
      LOCATOR_SET parameter can also be used to support end-host
      multihoming, detailed procedures are out of scope for this document.
      This document obsoletes RFC 5206.

  "Native NAT Traversal Mode for the Host Identity Protocol", Ari Keranen,
  Jan Melen, 2013-06-14, <draft-ietf-hip-native-nat-traversal-05.txt>

      This document specifies a new Network Address Translator (NAT)
      traversal mode for the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  The new mode is
      based on the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) methodology
      and UDP encapsulation of data and signaling traffic.  The main
      difference from the previously specified modes is the use of HIP
      messages for all NAT traversal procedures.

  "Using the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) Transport Format with
  the Host Identity Protocol (HIP)", Petri Jokela, Robert Moskowitz, Jan
  Melen, 2013-07-10, <draft-ietf-hip-rfc5202-bis-03.txt>

      This memo specifies an Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) based
      mechanism for transmission of user data packets, to be used with the
      Host Identity Protocol (HIP).

  "Host Multihoming with the Host Identity Protocol", Tom Henderson,
  Christian Vogt, Jari Arkko, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-hip-multihoming-03.txt>

      This document defines host multihoming extensions to the Host
      Identity Protocol (HIP), by leveraging protocol components defined
      for host mobility.

  "Host Identity Protocol Certificates", Tobias Heer, Samu Varjonen,
  2013-04-01, <draft-ietf-hip-rfc6253-bis-00.txt>

      The CERT parameter is a container for digital certificates.  It is
      used for carrying these certificates in Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
      control packets.  This document specifies the certificate parameter
      and the error signaling in case of a failed verification.
      Additionally, this document specifies the representations of Host
      Identity Tags in X.509 version 3 (v3) and SPKI certificates.
      
      The concrete use of certificates including how certificates are
      obtained, requested, and which actions are taken upon successful or
      failed verification are specific to the scenario in which the
      certificates are used.  Hence, the definition of these scenario-
      specific aspects are left to the documents that use the CERT
      parameter.
      
      This document updates RFC 5201.

Home Networking (homenet)
-------------------------

  "Home Networking Architecture for IPv6", Tim Chown, Jari Arkko, Anders
  Brandt, Ole Troan, Jason Weil, 2013-08-01,
  <draft-ietf-homenet-arch-10.txt>

      This text describes evolving networking technology within
      increasingly large residential home networks.  The goal of this
      document is to define a general architecture for IPv6-based home
      networking, describing the associated principles, considerations and
      requirements.  The text briefly highlights specific implications of
      the introduction of IPv6 for home networking, discusses the elements
      of the architecture, and suggests how standard IPv6 mechanisms and
      addressing can be employed in home networking.  The architecture
      describes the need for specific protocol extensions for certain
      additional functionality.  It is assumed that the IPv6 home network
      is not actively managed, and runs as an IPv6-only or dual-stack
      network.  There are no recommendations in this text for the IPv4 part
      of the network.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Authentication (httpauth)
-----------------------------------------------------

  "HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA)", Stephen Farrell, Paul
  Hoffman, Michael Thomas, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-httpauth-hoba-01.txt>

      HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a design for an HTTP
      authentication method with credentials that are not vulnerable to
      phishing attacks, and that does not require a server-side password
      database.  The design can also be used in Javascript-based
      authentication embedded in HTML.  HOBA is an alternative to HTTP
      authentication schemes that require passwords with all the negative
      attributes that come with password-based systems.

  "An Encoding Parameter for HTTP Basic Authentication", Julian Reschke,
  2013-06-30, <draft-ietf-httpauth-basicauth-enc-01.txt>

      The "Basic" authentication scheme defined in RFC 2617 does not
      properly define how to treat non-ASCII characters.  This has led to a
      situation where user agent implementations disagree, and servers make
      different assumptions based on the locales they are running in.
      There is little interoperability for the non-ASCII characters in the
      ISO-8859-1 character repertoire, and even less interoperability for
      any characters beyond that.
      
      This document defines a backwards-compatible extension to "Basic",
      specifying the server's character encoding scheme expectation, using
      a new authentication scheme parameter.

  "HTTP Digest Update", Rifaat Shekh-Yusef, David Ahrens, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-ietf-httpauth-digest-update-04.txt>

      This documents specifies extensions to the HTTP Digest Authentication
      mechanism to add support for new digest algorithms to the HTTP Digest
      Access Authentication scheme.

  "Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP", Yutaka Oiwa, Hajime Watanabe,
  Hiromitsu Takagi, Boku Kihara, Tatsuya Hayashi, Yuichi Ioku, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-ietf-httpauth-mutual-00.txt,.ps,.pdf>

      This document specifies a mutual authentication method for the Hyper-
      text Transport Protocol (HTTP).  This method provides a true mutual
      authentication between an HTTP client and an HTTP server using
      password-based authentication.  Unlike the Basic and Digest
      authentication methods, the Mutual authentication method specified in
      this document assures the user that the server truly knows the user's
      encrypted password.  This prevents common phishing attacks: a
      phishing attacker controlling a fake website cannot convince a user
      that he authenticated to the genuine website.  Furthermore, even when
      a user authenticates to an illegitimate server, the server cannot
      gain any information about the user's password.  The Mutual
      authentication method is designed as an extension to the HTTP
      protocol, and is intended to replace the existing authentication
      methods used in HTTP (the Basic method, Digest method, and
      authentication using HTML forms).

  "HTTP Authentication Extensions for Interactive Clients", Yutaka Oiwa,
  Hajime Watanabe, Hiromitsu Takagi, Boku Kihara, Tatsuya Hayashi, Yuichi
  Ioku, 2013-07-01, <draft-ietf-httpauth-extension-00.txt,.ps,.pdf>

      This document specifies a few extensions of HTTP authentication
      framework for interactive clients.  Recently, fundamental features of
      HTTP-level authentication is not enough for complex requirements of
      various Web-based applications.  This makes these applications to
      implement their own authentication frameworks using HTML Forms and
      other means, which becomes one of the hurdles against introducing
      secure authentication mechanisms handled jointly by servers and user-
      agent clients.  The extended framework fills gaps between Web
      application requirements and HTTP authentication provisions to solve
      the above problems, while maintaining compatibility against existing
      Web and non-Web uses of HTTP authentications.

  "Salted Challenge Response (SCRAM) HTTP Authentication Mechanism",
  Alexey Melnikov, 2013-07-01, <draft-ietf-httpauth-scram-auth-00.txt>

      The secure authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used by
      Internet application protocols is the transmission of clear-text
      passwords over a channel protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS).
      There are some significant security concerns with that mechanism,
      which could be addressed by the use of a challenge response
      authentication mechanism protected by TLS.  Unfortunately, the HTTP
      Digest challenge response mechanism presently on the standards track
      failed widespread deployment, and have had success only in limited
      use.
      
      This specification describes a family of HTTP authentication
      mechanisms called the Salted Challenge Response Authentication
      Mechanism (SCRAM), which addresses the security concerns and meets
      the deployability requirements.  When used in combination with TLS or
      an equivalent security layer, a mechanism from this family could
      improve the status-quo for application protocol authentication.

  "An Encoding Mechanism for HTTP Digest Authentication", Rifaat
  Shekh-Yusef, 2013-07-07, <draft-ietf-httpauth-digest-encoding-02.txt>

      RFC2617 does not define how to treat Unicode characters [UNICODE]
      outside the ASCII range [RFC20] with the "Digest" scheme.  This
      document defines an extension to the "Digest" scheme, and a mechanism
      that enables the client and server to negotiate their support for the
      UTF-8 [RFC3629] character encoding scheme.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Bis (httpbis)
-----------------------------------------

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Authentication", Roy Fielding,
  Julian Reschke, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-httpbis-p7-auth-23.txt>

      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
      protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
      systems.  This document defines the HTTP Authentication framework.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests", Roy
  Fielding, Julian Reschke, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-p4-conditional-23.txt>

      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
      protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
      systems.  This document defines HTTP/1.1 conditional requests,
      including metadata header fields for indicating state changes,
      request header fields for making preconditions on such state, and
      rules for constructing the responses to a conditional request when
      one or more preconditions evaluate to false.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing",
  Roy Fielding, Julian Reschke, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging-23.txt>

      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
      protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
      systems.  HTTP has been in use by the World Wide Web global
      information initiative since 1990.  This document provides an
      overview of HTTP architecture and its associated terminology, defines
      the "http" and "https" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes,
      defines the HTTP/1.1 message syntax and parsing requirements, and
      describes general security concerns for implementations.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching", Roy Fielding, Mark
  Nottingham, Julian Reschke, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-p6-cache-23.txt>

      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
      protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
      systems.  This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the
      associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate
      cacheable response messages.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content", Roy
  Fielding, Julian Reschke, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics-23.txt>

      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
      protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
      systems.  This document defines the semantics of HTTP/1.1 messages,
      as expressed by request methods, request header fields, response
      status codes, and response header fields, along with the payload of
      messages (metadata and body content) and mechanisms for content
      negotiation.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests", Roy Fielding,
  Yves Lafon, Julian Reschke, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-p5-range-23.txt>

      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
      protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
      systems.  This document defines range requests and the rules for
      constructing and combining responses to those requests.

  "Initial Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Method Registrations",
  Julian Reschke, 2013-08-06,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-method-registrations-12.txt>

      This document registers those Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
      methods which have been defined in standards-track RFCs before the
      IANA HTTP Method Registry was established.

  "Initial Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Scheme
  Registrations", Julian Reschke, 2013-08-06,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-authscheme-registrations-07.txt>

      This document registers Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
      authentication schemes which have been defined in standards-track
      RFCs before the IANA HTTP Authentication Scheme Registry was
      established.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2.0", Mike Belshe, Roberto Peon,
  Martin Thomson, Alexey Melnikov, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-04.txt>

      This specification describes an optimized expression of the syntax of
      the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  The HTTP/2.0 encapsulation
      enables more efficient use of network resources and reduced
      perception of latency by allowing header field compression and
      multiple concurrent messages on the same connection.  It also
      introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to
      clients.
      
      This document is an alternative to, but does not obsolete the
      HTTP/1.1 message format or protocol.  HTTP's existing semantics
      remain unchanged.
      
      This version of the draft has been marked for implementation.
      Interoperability testing will occur in the HTTP/2.0 interim in
      Hamburg, DE, starting 2013-08-05.

  "HTTP/2.0 Header Compression", Roberto Peon, Herve Ruellan, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-header-compression-01.txt>

      This document describes a format adapted to efficiently represent
      HTTP headers in the context of HTTP/2.0.

BiDirectional or Server-Initiated HTTP (hybi)
---------------------------------------------

  "A Multiplexing Extension for WebSockets", John Tamplin, Takeshi
  Yoshino, 2013-07-02, <draft-ietf-hybi-websocket-multiplexing-11.txt>

      The WebSocket Protocol [RFC6455] requires a new transport connection
      for every WebSocket connection.  This presents a scalability problem
      when many clients connect to the same server, and is made worse by
      having multiple clients running in different tabs of the same user
      agent.  This extension provides a way for separate logical WebSocket
      connections to share an underlying transport connection.
      
      Please send feedback to the hybi@ietf.org mailing list.

  "Compression Extensions for WebSocket", Takeshi Yoshino, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-hybi-permessage-compression-12.txt>

      This document specifies a framework for creating WebSocket extensions
      that add compression functionality to the WebSocket Protocol.  An
      extension based on this framework compresses the payload data portion
      of non-control WebSocket messages on a per-message basis using
      parameters negotiated during the opening handshake.  This framework
      provides a general method to apply a compression algorithm to the
      contents of WebSocket messages.  For each compression algorithm, an
      extension is defined by specifying parameter negotiation and
      compression algorithm in detail.  This document also specifies one
      specific compression extension using the DEFLATE algorithm.
      
      Please send feedback to the hybi@ietf.org mailing list.

Interface to the Routing System (i2rs)
--------------------------------------

  "Interface to the Routing System Problem Statement", Alia Atlas, Thomas
  Nadeau, David Ward, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-atlas-i2rs-problem-statement-01.txt>

      As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, the need for rapid
      and dynamic control increases.  With scale, the need to automate even
      the simplest operations is important, but even more critical is the
      ability to quickly interact with more complex operations such as
      policy-based controls.
      
      In order to enable applications to have access to and control over
      information in the Internet's routing system, we need a publicly
      documented interface specification.  The interface needs to support
      real-time, asynchronous interactions using data models and encodings
      that are efficient and potentially different from those available
      today.  Furthermore, the interface must be tailored to support a
      variety of use cases.
      
      This document expands upon these statements of requirements to
      provide a detailed problem statement for an Interface to the Internet
      Routing System (I2RS).

  "Use Cases for an Interface to BGP Protocol", Keyur Patel, Rex Fernando,
  Hannes Gredler, Shane Amante, 2013-03-11,
  <draft-keyupate-i2rs-bgp-usecases-00.txt>

      A network routing protocol like BGP is typically configured and
      results of its operation are analyzed through some form of Command
      Line Interface (CLI) or NETCONF.  These interactions to control BGP
      and diagnose its operation encompass: configuration of protocol
      parameters, display of protocol data, setting of certain protocol
      state and debugging of the protocol.
      
      Interface to the Routing System's (I2RS) Programmatic interfaces, as
      defined in [I-D.ward-i2rs-framework], provides an alternate way to
      control the configuration and diagnose the operation of the BGP
      protocol.  I2RS may be used for the configuration, manipulation,
      polling or analyzing protocol data.  This document describes set of
      use cases for which I2RS can be used for BGP protocol.  It is
      intended to provide a base for the solution draft describing a set of
      interfaces to the BGP protocol.

  "Routing Information Base Info Model", Nitin Bahadur, Ron Folkes,
  Sriganesh Kini, Jan Medved, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-nitinb-i2rs-rib-info-model-01.txt>

      Routing and routing functions in enterprise and carrier networks are
      typically performed by network devices (routers and switches) using a
      routing information base (RIB).  Protocols and configuration push
      data into the RIB and the RIB manager install state into the
      hardware; for packet forwarding.  This draft specifies an information
      model for the RIB to enable defining a standardized data model.  Such
      a data model can be used to define an interface to the RIB from an
      entity that may even be external to the network device.  This
      interface can be used to support new use-cases being defined by the
      IETF I2RS WG.

  "An Architecture for the Interface to the Routing System", Alia Atlas,
  Joel Halpern, Susan Hares, David Ward, Thomas Nadeau, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-atlas-i2rs-architecture-01.txt>

      This document describes an architecture for a standard, programmatic
      interface for state transfer in and out of the Internet's routing
      system.  It describes the basic architecture, the components, and
      their interfaces with particular focus on those to be standardized as
      part of I2RS.

Inter-Domain Routing (idr)

  "Definitions of Managed Objects for the Fourth Version of Border Gateway
  Protocol (BGP-4), Second Version", Jeffrey Haas, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp4-mibv2-14.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
      objects for managing the Border Gateway Protocol, Version 4.

  "Definitions of Textual Conventions for the Management of the Fourth
  Version of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-4)", Jeffrey Haas, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp4-mibv2-tc-mib-04.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      which defines Textual Conventions for the management of BGP-4.  The
      intent is that these textual conventions will be used in BGP-related
      MIB modules that would otherwise define their own representations.

  "The Accumulated IGP Metric Attribute for BGP", Prodosh Mohapatra, Rex
  Fernando, Eric Rosen, Jim Uttaro, 2013-05-23,
  <draft-ietf-idr-aigp-10.txt>

      Routing protocols that have been designed to run within a single
      administrative domain ("IGPs") generally do so by assigning a metric
      to each link, and then choosing as the installed path between two
      nodes the path for which the total distance (sum of the metric of
      each link along the path) is minimized.  BGP, designed to provide
      routing over a large number of independent administrative domains
      ("autonomous systems"), does not make its path selection decisions
      through the use of a metric.  It is generally recognized that any
      attempt to do so would incur significant scalability problems, as
      well as inter-administration coordination problems.  However, there
      are deployments in which a single administration runs several
      contiguous BGP networks.  In such cases, it can be desirable, within
      that single administrative domain, for BGP to select paths based on a
      metric, just as an IGP would do.  The purpose of this document is to
      provide a specification for doing so.

  "BGP Bestpath Selection Criteria Enhancement", Rajiv Asati, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp-bestpath-selection-criteria-06.txt>

      BGP specification [RFC4271] prescribes 'BGP next-hop reachability'
      as one of the key 'Route Resolvability Condition' that must be
      satisfied before the BGP bestpath candidate selection. This
      condition, however, may not be sufficient (as explained in the
      Appendix section) and desire further granularity.
      
      This document defines enhances the "Route Resolvability Condition"
      to facilitate the next-hop to be resolved in the chosen data plane.

  "Best Practices for Advertisement of Multiple Paths in IBGP", Jim
  Uttaro, Pierre Francois, Roberto Fragassi, Adam Simpson, Keyur Patel,
  2013-06-24, <draft-ietf-idr-add-paths-guidelines-05.txt>

      Add-Paths is a BGP enhancement that allows a BGP router to advertise
      multiple distinct paths for the same prefix/NLRI. This provides a
      number of potential benefits, including reduced routing churn, faster
      convergence and better loadsharing.
      
      This document provides recommendations to implementers of Add-Paths
      so that network operators have the tools needed to address their
      specific applications and to manage the scalability impact of Add-
      Paths. A router implementing Add-Paths may learn many paths for a
      prefix and must decide which of these to advertise to peers. This
      document analyses different algorithms for making this selection and
      provides recommendations based on the target application.

  "Assigned BGP extended communities", Bruno Decraene, Pierre Francois,
  2013-05-21, <draft-ietf-idr-reserved-extended-communities-05.txt>

      This document defines an IANA registry in order to assign non-
      transitive extended communities from.  These are similar to the
      existing well-known BGP communities defined in RFC 1997 but provide a
      control over inter-AS community advertisement as, per RFC RFC 4360,
      they are not transitive across Autonomous System boundaries.
      
      For that purpose, this document defines the use of the reserved
      Autonomous System number 0.65535 in the non-transitive generic four-
      octet AS specific extended community type.

  "Enhanced Route Refresh Capability for BGP-4", Keyur Patel, Enke Chen,
  Balaji Venkatachalapathy, 2013-06-24,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp-enhanced-route-refresh-04.txt>

      In this document we enhance the existing BGP route refresh mechanisms
      to provide for the demarcation of the beginning and the ending of a
      route refresh.  The enhancement can be used to facilitate on-line,
      non-disruptive consistency validations of BGP routing updates.

  "BGP Optimal Route Reflection (BGP-ORR)", Robert Raszuk, Christian
  Cassar, Erik Aman, Bruno Decraene, Stephane Litkowski, 2013-06-04,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp-optimal-route-reflection-05.txt>

      [RFC4456] asserts that, because the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
      cost to a given point in the network will vary across routers, "the
      route reflection approach may not yield the same route selection
      result as that of the full IBGP mesh approach."  One practical
      implication of this assertion is that the deployment of route
      reflection may thwart the ability to achieve hot potato routing.  Hot
      potato routing attempts to direct traffic to the closest AS egress
      point in cases where no higher priority policy dictates otherwise.
      As a consequence of the route reflection method, the choice of exit
      point for a route reflector and its clients will be the egress point
      closest to the route reflector - and not necessarily closest to the
      RR clients.
      
      Section 11 of [RFC4456] describes a deployment approach and a set of
      constraints which, if satsified, would result in the deployment of
      route reflection yielding the same results as the iBGP full mesh
      approach.  Such a deployment approach would make route reflection
      compatible with the application of hot potato routing policy.
      
      As networks evolved to accommodate architectural requirements of new
      services, tunneled (LSP/IP tunneling) networks with centralized route
      reflectors became commonplace.  This is one type of common deployment
      where it would be impractical to satisfy the constraints described in
      Section 11 of [RFC4456].  Yet, in such an environment, hot potato
      routing policy remains desirable.
      
      This document proposes two new solutions which can be deployed to
      facilitate the application of closest exit point policy centralized
      route reflection deployments.

  "Extended Message support for BGP", Keyur Patel, David Ward, Randy Bush,
  2013-08-03, <draft-ietf-idr-bgp-extended-messages-06.txt>

      The BGP specification mandates a maximum BGP message size of 4096
      octets.  As BGP is extended to support newer AFI/SAFIs, there is a
      need to extend the maximum message size beyond 4096 octets.  This
      document updates [RFC4271] by providing an extension to BGP to extend
      its current message size from 4096 octets to 65535 octets.

  "IPv6 Extensions for Route Target Distribution", Keyur Patel, Robert
  Raszuk, Martine Djernaes, Jie Dong, Mach Chen, 2013-08-07,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ipv6-rt-constrain-04.txt>

      The current route target distribution specification described in
      RFC4684 defines Route Target NLRIs of maximum length of 12 bytes.
      The IPv6 specific Route Target extended community is defined in
      [RFC5701] as length of 20 bytes.  Since the current specification
      only supports prefixes of maximum length of 12 bytes, the lack of an
      IPv6 specific Route Target reachability information may be a problem
      when an operator wants to use this application in a pure IPv6
      environment.  This document defines an extension that allows BGP to
      exchange longer length IPv6 Route Target prefixes.

  "Revised Error Handling for BGP UPDATE Messages", John Scudder, Enke
  Chen, Prodosh Mohapatra, Keyur Patel, 2013-06-24,
  <draft-ietf-idr-error-handling-04.txt>

      According to the base BGP specification, a BGP speaker that receives
      an UPDATE message containing a malformed attribute is required to
      reset the session over which the offending attribute was received.
      This behavior is undesirable as a session reset would impact not only
      routes with the offending attribute, but also other valid routes
      exchanged over the session.  This document partially revises the
      error handling for UPDATE messages, and provides guidelines for the
      authors of documents defining new attributes.  Finally, it revises
      the error handling procedures for a number of existing attributes.

  "BGP Custom Decision Process", Alvaro Retana, Russ White, 2013-05-20,
  <draft-ietf-idr-custom-decision-03.txt>

      The BGP specification defines a Decision Process for installation of
      routes into the Loc-RIB.  This process takes into account an
      extensive series of path attributes, which can be manipulated to
      indicate preference for specific paths.  It is cumbersome (if at all
      possible) for the end user to define policies that will select, after
      partial comparison, a path based on subjective local (domain and/or
      node) criteria.
      
      This document defines a new Extended Community, called the Cost
      Community, which may be used in tie breaking during the best path
      selection process.  The end result is a local custom decision
      process.

  "Codification of AS 0 processing.", Warren Kumari, Randy Bush, Heather
  Schiller, Keyur Patel, 2012-08-26, <draft-ietf-idr-as0-06.txt>

      This document updates RFC 4271 and proscribes the use of Autonomous
      System (AS) 0 in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) OPEN and AS_PATH /
      AS4_PATH BGP attribute.

  "Accelerated Routing Convergence for BGP Graceful Restart", Keyur Patel,
  Enke Chen, Rex Fernando, John Scudder, 2013-06-24,
  <draft-ietf-idr-enhanced-gr-03.txt>

      In this document we specify extensions to BGP graceful restart in
      order to avoid unnecessary transmission of the routing information
      preserved across a session restart, thus accelerating the routing
      convergence.

  "Notification Message support for BGP Graceful Restart", Keyur Patel,
  Rex Fernando, John Scudder, Jeffrey Haas, 2013-04-25,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp-gr-notification-01.txt>

      The current BGP Graceful Restart mechanism limits the usage of BGP
      Graceful Restart to BGP protocol messages other than a BGP
      NOTIFICATION message.  This document defines an extension to the BGP
      Graceful Restart that permits the Graceful Restart procedures to be
      performed when the BGP speaker receives a BGP NOTIFICATION Message.
      This document also defines a new BGP NOTIFICATION Cease Error subcode
      to prevent BGP speakers supporting the extension defined in this
      document from performing a Graceful Restart.

  "Automatic Route Target Filtering for legacy PEs", Pradosh Mohapatra,
  Arjun Sreekantiah, Keyur Patel, Burjiz Pithawala, Alton Lo, 2013-03-13,
  <draft-ietf-idr-legacy-rtc-01.txt>

      This document describes a simple procedure that allows "legacy" BGP
      speakers to exchange route target membership information in BGP
      without using mechanisms specified in [RFC4684].  The intention of
      the proposed technique is to help in partial deployment scenarios and
      is not meant to replace [RFC4684].

  "Internet Exchange Route Server", Elisa Jasinska, Nick Hilliard, Robert
  Raszuk, Niels Bakker, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server-02.txt>

      This document outlines a specification for multilateral
      interconnections at Internet exchange points (IXPs).  Multilateral
      interconnection is a method of exchanging routing information between
      three or more exterior BGP speakers using a single intermediate
      broker system, referred to as a route server.  Route servers are
      typically used on shared access media networks, such as Internet
      exchange points (IXPs), to facilitate simplified interconnection
      between multiple Internet routers.

  "Making Route Flap Damping Usable", Cristel Pelsser, Randy Bush, Keyur
  Patel, Pradosh Mohapatra, Olaf Maennel, 2013-03-11,
  <draft-ietf-idr-rfd-usable-02.txt>

      Route Flap Damping (RFD) was first proposed to reduce BGP churn in
      routers.  Unfortunately, RFD was found to severely penalize sites for
      being well-connected because topological richness amplifies the
      number of update messages exchanged.  Many operators have turned RFD
      off.  Based on experimental measurement, this document recommends
      adjusting a few RFD algorithmic constants and limits, to reduce the
      high risks with RFD, with the result being damping a non-trivial
      amount of long term churn without penalizing well-behaved prefixes'
      normal convergence process.

  "North-Bound Distribution of Link-State and TE Information using BGP",
  Hannes Gredler, Jan Medved, Stefano Previdi, Adrian Farrel, Saikat Ray,
  2013-05-21, <draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution-03.txt>

      In a number of environments, a component external to a network is
      called upon to perform computations based on the network topology and
      current state of the connections within the network, including
      traffic engineering information.  This is information typically
      distributed by IGP routing protocols within the network
      
      This document describes a mechanism by which links state and traffic
      engineering information can be collected from networks and shared
      with external components using the BGP routing protocol.  This is
      achieved using a new BGP Network Layer Reachability Information
      (NLRI) encoding format.  The mechanism is applicable to physical and
      virtual IGP links.  The mechanism described is subject to policy
      control.
      
      Applications of this technique include Application Layer Traffic
      Optimization (ALTO) servers, and Path Computation Elements (PCEs).

  "Inter-domain SLA Exchange", Shitanshu Shah, Keyur Patel, Sandeep Bajaj,
  Luis Tomotaki, Mohamed Boucadair, 2013-06-27,
  <draft-ietf-idr-sla-exchange-01.txt>

      Network administrators typically provision QoS (Quality of Service)
      policies for their application traffic (such as voice, video) based
      on SLAs (Service Level Agreements) negotiated with their providers,
      and translate those SLAs to vendor specific configuration language.
      Both learning of SLA, either thru SLA documents or via some other
      out-of-band method, and translating them to vendor specific
      configuration language is a complex, many times manual, process and
      prone to errors.  This document proposes an in-band method of SLA
      signaling which can help to simplify some of the complexities.
      
      This document defines an operational transitive attribute to signal
      SLA details in-band, across administrative boundaries (considered as
      Autonomous Systems (AS)), thus simplify and speed-up some of the
      complex provisioning tasks.
      
      Though the use case with the proposed attribute is explicitly defined
      in this document, purpose of this attribute is not limited to this
      use case only.

  "BGP Flow-Spec Extended Community for Traffic Redirect to IP Next Hop",
  Jim Uttaro, Matthieu Texier, David Smith, Wim Henderickx, Adam Simpson,
  2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-idr-flowspec-redirect-ip-00.txt>

      Flow-spec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination
      of traffic flow specification rules. This has many possible
      applications but the primary one for many network operators is the
      distribution of traffic filtering actions for DDoS mitigation. The
      flow-spec standard [RFC 5575] defines a redirect-to-VRF action for
      policy-based forwarding but this mechanism can be difficult to use,
      particularly in networks without L3 VPNs.
      
      This draft proposes a new redirect-to-IP flow-spec action that
      provides a simpler method of policy-based forwarding. This action is
      indicated by the presence of a new BGP extended community in the
      flow-spec route. Many routers already support a redirect-to-IP
      filter action and, in this case, the only new functionality implied
      by this draft is the ability to signal the action using flow-spec.

  "Reservation of Last Autonomous System (AS) Numbers", Jeffrey Haas, Jon
  Mitchell, 2013-07-17, <draft-ietf-idr-last-as-reservation-00.txt>

      This document reserves two Autonomous System numbers (ASNs) at the
      end of the 16 bit and 32 bit ranges, described in this document as
      "Last ASNs" and provides guidance to implementers and operators on
      their use.

  Multimedia Communication Networks", Paul Jones, Gonzalo Salgueiro, James
  Polk, Laura Liess, Hadriel Kaplan, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-insipid-session-id-reqts-08.txt>

      This document specifies the requirements for an end-to-end session
      identifier in IP-based multimedia communication networks.  This
      identifier would enable endpoints, intermediate devices, and
      management and monitoring systems to identify a session end-to-end
      across multiple SIP devices, hops, and administrative domains.

  "End-to-End Session Identification in IP-Based Multimedia Communication
  Networks", Paul Jones, Chris Pearce, James Polk, Gonzalo Salgueiro,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-insipid-session-id-02.txt>

      This document describes an end-to-end Session Identifier for use in
      IP-based Multimedia Communication systems that enables endpoints,
      intermediate devices, and management systems to identify a session
      end-to-end, associate multiple endpoints with a given multipoint
      conference, track communication sessions when they are redirected,
      and associate one or more media flows with a given communication
      session.

  "Using the IPv6 Flow Label for Server Load Balancing", Brian Carpenter,
  Sheng Jiang, Willy Tarreau, 2013-05-25,
  <draft-ietf-intarea-flow-label-balancing-01.txt>

      This document describes how the IPv6 flow label as currently
      specified can be used to enhance layer 3/4 load distribution and
      balancing for large server farms.

IP Flow Information Export (ipfix)
----------------------------------

  "Flow Selection Techniques", Salvatore D'Antonio, Tanja Zseby, Christian
  Henke, Lorenzo Peluso, 2013-05-30,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-flow-selection-tech-18.txt>

      Intermediate Flow Selection Process is the process of selecting a
      subset of Flows from all observed Flows.  The Intermediate Flow
      Selection Process may be located at an IPFIX Exporter, Collector, or
      within an IPFIX Mediator.  It reduces the effort of post-processing
      Flow data and transferring Flow Records.  This document describes
      motivations for using the Intermediate Flow Selection process and
      presents Intermediate Flow Selection techniques.  It provides an
      information model for configuring Intermediate Flow Selection Process
      techniques and discusses what information about an Intermediate Flow
      Selection Process should be exported.

  "Guidelines for Authors and Reviewers of IPFIX Information Elements",
  Brian Trammell, Benoit Claise, 2012-10-03,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-ie-doctors-07.txt>

      This document provides guidelines for how to write definitions of new
      Information Elements for the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
      protocol.  It provides instructions on using the proper conventions
      for Information Elements to be registered in the IANA IPFIX
      Information Element registry, and provides guidelines for expert
      reviewers to evaluate new registrations.

  "Flow Aggregation for the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol",
  Brian Trammell, Arno Wagner, Benoit Claise, 2012-11-19,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-a9n-08.txt>

      This document provides a common implementation-independent basis for
      the interoperable application of the IP Flow Information Export
      (IPFIX) Protocol to the handling of Aggregated Flows, which are IPFIX
      Flows representing packets from multiple Original Flows sharing some
      set of common properties.  It does this through a detailed
      terminology and a descriptive Intermediate Aggregation Process
      architecture, including a specification of methods for Original Flow
      counting and counter distribution across intervals.

  "Specification of the IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX) Protocol for
  the Exchange of Flow Information", Benoit Claise, Brian Trammell,
  2013-07-11, <draft-ietf-ipfix-protocol-rfc5101bis-10.txt>

      This document specifies the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
      protocol that serves for transmitting Traffic Flow information over
      the network. In order to transmit Traffic Flow information from an
      Exporting Process to a Collecting Process, a common representation of
      flow data and a standard means of communicating them is required.
      This document describes how the IPFIX Data and Template Records are
      carried over a number of transport protocols from an IPFIX Exporting
      Process to an IPFIX Collecting Process. This document obsoletes RFC
      5101.

  "Operation of the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol on IPFIX
  Mediators", Benoit Claise, Atsushi Kobayashi, Brian Trammell,
  2013-07-29, <draft-ietf-ipfix-mediation-protocol-06.txt>

      This document specifies the operation of the IP Flow Information
      Export (IPFIX) protocol specific to IPFIX Mediators, including
      Template and Observation Point management, timing considerations, and
      other Mediator-specific concerns.

  "Information Model for IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX)", Benoit
  Claise, Brian Trammell, 2013-02-12,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-information-model-rfc5102bis-10.txt>

      This document defines the datatypes and management policy for the
      information model for the IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX)
      protocol. This information model is maintained as the IANA IPFIX
      Information Element Registry, the initial contents of which were
      defined by RFC 5102. This information model is used by the IPFIX
      Protocol for encoding measured traffic information and information
      related to the traffic Observation Point, the traffic Metering
      Process, and the Exporting Process. Although developed for the IPFIX
      Protocol, the model is defined in an open way that easily allows
      using it in other protocols, interfaces, and applications. This
      document obsoletes RFC 5102.

  "Exporting MIB Variables using the IPFIX Protocol", Benoit Claise, Paul
  Aitken, Jürgen Schönwälder, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-mib-variable-export-02.txt>

      This document specifies a way to complement IPFIX Flow Records with
      Management Information Base (MIB) objects, avoiding the need to
      define new IPFIX Information Elements for existing Management
      Information Base objects that are already fully specified.
      
      This method requires an extension to the current IPFIX protocol.  New
      Template Set and Options Template Sets are specified to allow the
      export of Extended Field Specifiers, which may represent IPFIX
      Information Elements and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
      MIB Objects.

  "Information Elements for Data Link Layer Traffic Measurement", Shingo
  Kashima, Atsushi Kobayashi, Paul Aitken, 2013-07-02,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-data-link-layer-monitoring-03.txt>

      This document describes Information Elements related to data link
      layer.  They are used by the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
      protocol for encoding measured data link layer traffic information.

IP Performance Metrics (ippm)
-----------------------------

  "Rate Measurement Test Protocol Problem Statement", Al Morton,
  2013-04-23, <draft-ietf-ippm-rate-problem-03.txt>

      This memo presents an access rate-measurement problem statement for
      test protocols to measure IP Performance Metrics.  The rate
      measurement scenario has wide-spread attention of Internet access
      subscribers and seemingly all industry players, including regulators.
      Key test protocol aspects require the ability to control packet size
      on the tested path and enable asymmetrical packet size testing in a
      controller-responder architecture.

  "Test Plan and Results for Advancing RFC 2680 on the Standards Track",
  Len Ciavattone, Ruediger Geib, Al Morton, Matthias Wieser, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-ietf-ippm-testplan-rfc2680-03.txt>

      This memo proposes to advance a performance metric RFC along the
      standards track, specifically RFC 2680 on One-way Loss Metrics.
      Observing that the metric definitions themselves should be the
      primary focus rather than the implementations of metrics, this memo
      describes the test procedures to evaluate specific metric requirement
      clauses to determine if the requirement has been interpreted and
      implemented as intended.  Two completely independent implementations
      have been tested against the key specifications of RFC 2680.

  "Model Based Bulk Performance Metrics", Matt Mathis, Al Morton,
  2013-06-21, <draft-ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics-00.txt>

      We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to determine
      if a long path can meet predefined end-to-end application performance
      targets.  This is done by subpath at a time testing -- by applying a
      suite of single property tests to successive subpaths of a long path.
      In many cases these single property tests are based on existing IPPM
      metrics, with the addition of success and validity criteria.  The
      subpath at a time tests are designed to facilitate IP providers
      eliminating all known conditions that might prevent the full end-to-
      end path from meeting the users target performance.
      
      This approach makes it possible to to determine the IP performance
      requirements needed to support the desired end-to-end TCP
      performance.  The IP metrics are based on traffic patterns that mimic
      TCP but are precomputed independently of the actual behavior of TCP
      over the subpath under test.  This makes the measurements open loop,
      eliminating nearly all of the difficulties encountered by traditional
      bulk transport metrics, which rely on congestion control equilibrium
      behavior.
      
      A natural consequence of this methodology is verifiable network
      measurement: measurements from any given vantage point are repeatable
      from other vantage points.

  "Network Performance Measurement for IPsec", Kostas Pentikousis, Yang
  Cui, Emma Zhang, 2013-07-05, <draft-ietf-ippm-ipsec-00.txt>

      IPsec is a mature technology with several interoperable
      implementations.  Indeed, the use of IPsec tunnels is increasingly
      gaining popularity in several deployment scenarios, not the least in
      what used to be solely areas of traditional telecommunication
      protocols.  Wider deployment calls for mechanisms and methods that
      enable tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure one-way and
      two-way network performance.  Unfortunately, however, standard IP
      performance measurement security mechanisms cannot be readily used
      with IPsec.  This document makes the case for employing IPsec to
      protect the One-way and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocols (O/
      TWAMP) and proposes a method which combines IKEv2 and O/TWAMP as
      defined in RFC 4656 and RFC 5357, respectively.  This specification
      aims, on the one hand, to ensure that O/TWAMP can be secured with the
      best mechanisms we have at our disposal today while, on the other
      hand, it facilitates the applicability of O/TWAMP to networks that
      have already deployed IPsec.

  "A Reference Path and Measurement Points for LMAP", Marcelo Bagnulo,
  Trevor Burbridge, Sam Crawford, Philip Eardley, Al Morton, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-ietf-ippm-lmap-path-00.txt>

      This document defines a reference path for Large-scale Measurement of
      Broadband Access Performance (LMAP) and measurement points for
      commonly used performance metrics.

  "Advanced Stream and Sampling Framework for IPPM", Joachim Fabini, Al
  Morton, 2013-07-11, <draft-ietf-ippm-2330-update-00.txt>

      To obtain repeatable results in modern networks, test descriptions
      need an expanded stream parameter framework that also augments
      aspects specified as Type-P for test packets.  This memo proposes to
      update the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework with advanced
      considerations for measurement methodology and testing.  The existing
      framework mostly assumes deterministic connectivity, and that a
      single test stream will represent the characteristics of the path
      when it is aggregated with other flows.  Networks have evolved and
      test stream descriptions must evolve with them, otherwise unexpected
      network features may dominate the measured performance.  This memo
      describes new stream parameters for both network characterization and
      support of application design using IPPM metrics.

IP Security Maintenance and Extensions (ipsecme)
------------------------------------------------

  "Auto Discovery VPN Problem Statement and Requirements", Vishwas Manral,
  Stephen Hanna, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-ipsecme-ad-vpn-problem-09.txt>

      This document describes the problem of enabling a large number of
      systems to communicate directly using IPsec to protect the traffic
      between them.  It then expands on the requirements, for such a
      solution.
      
      Manual configuration of all possible tunnels is too cumbersome in
      many such cases.  In other cases the IP address of endpoints change
      or the endpoints may be behind NAT gateways, making static
      configuration impossible.  The Auto Discovery VPN solution will
      address these requirements.

  "Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance
  for Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header
  (AH)", David McGrew, Wajdi Feghali, 2013-03-12,
  <draft-ietf-ipsecme-esp-ah-reqts-00.txt>

      This Internet Draft is standards track proposal to update to the
      Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for ESP and AH;
      it also adds usage guidance to help in the selection of these
      algorithms.
      
      The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header
      (AH) protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms to
      provide confidentiality and/or data origin authentication to
      protected data communications in the IP Security (IPsec)
      architecture.  To ensure interoperability between disparate
      implementations, the IPsec standard specifies a set of mandatory-to-
      implement algorithms.  This document specifies the current set of
      mandatory-to-implement algorithms for ESP and AH, specifies
      algorithms that should be implemented because they may be promoted to
      mandatory at some future time, and also recommends against the
      implementation of some obsolete algorithms.  Usage guidance is also
      provided to help the user of ESP and AH best achieve their security
      goals through appropriate choices of cryptographic algorithms.

  "More Raw Public Keys for IKEv2", Tero Kivinen, Paul Wouters, Hannes
  Tschofenig, 2013-04-08, <draft-ietf-ipsecme-oob-pubkey-00.txt>

      The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol currently only
      supports raw RSA keys.  In some environments it is useful to make use
      of other types of public keys, such as those based on Elliptic Curve
      Cryptography.  This documents adds support for other types of raw
      public keys to IKEv2 and obsoletes the old raw RSA key format.

  "IKEv2 Fragmentation", Valery Smyslov, 2013-07-02,
  <draft-ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-fragmentation-00.txt>

      This document describes the way to avoid IP fragmentation of large
      IKEv2 messages.  This allows IKEv2 messages to traverse network
      devices that don't allow IP fragments to pass through.

  "IS-IS Reverse Metric TLV for Network Maintenance Events", Naiming Shen,
  Tony Li, Shane Amante, Mikael Abrahamsson, 2013-02-14,
  <draft-ietf-isis-reverse-metric-03.txt>

      This document describes an improved IS-IS neighbor management scheme
      which can be used to enhance network performance by allowing
      operators to quickly and accurately shift traffic away from a point-
      to-point or multi-access LAN interface by allowing one IS-IS router
      to signal to a second, adjacent IS-IS neighbor to adjust its IS-IS
      metric that should be used to temporarily reach the first IS-IS
      router during network maintenance events.

  Donald Eastlake, Tissa Senevirathne, Anoop Ghanwani, Dinesh Dutt, Ayan
  Banerjee, 2013-04-09, <draft-ietf-isis-rfc6326bis-01.txt>

      The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
      protocol provides optimal pair-wise data frame forwarding without
      configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology and link
      technology, and support for multipathing of both unicast and
      multicast traffic. This document specifies the data formats and code
      points for the IS-IS extensions to support TRILL. These data formats
      and code points may also be used by technologies other than TRILL.
      This document obsoletes RFC 6326.

  Filsfils, 2013-06-17, <draft-ietf-isis-te-metric-extensions-00.txt>

      In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
      information networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network
      performance criteria (e.g. latency) are becoming as critical to data
      path selection as other metrics.
      
      This document describes extensions to IS-IS TE [RFC5305] such that
      network performance information can be distributed and collected in a
      scalable fashion.  The information distributed using ISIS TE Metric
      Extensions can then be used to make path selection decisions based on
      network performance.
      
      Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which network
      performance information is distributed.  The mechanisms for measuring
      network performance or acting on that information, once distributed,
      are outside the scope of this document.

  "Use Cases and Requirements for JSON Object Signing and Encryption
  (JOSE)", Richard Barnes, 2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-jose-use-cases-03.txt>

      Many Internet applications have a need for object-based security
      mechanisms in addition to security mechanisms at the network layer or
      transport layer.  In the past, the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
      has provided a binary secure object format based on ASN.1.  Over
      time, the use of binary object encodings such as ASN.1 has been
      overtaken by text-based encodings, for example JavaScript Object
      Notation.  This document defines a set of use cases and requirements
      for a secure object format encoded using JavaScript Object Notation
      (JSON), drawn from a variety of application security mechanisms
      currently in development.

JavaScript Object Notation (json)
---------------------------------

  "The application/json Media Type for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)",
  Douglas Crockford, 2013-06-06, <draft-ietf-json-rfc4627bis-02.txt>

      JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, text-based,
      language-independent data interchange format.  It was derived from
      the ECMAScript Programming Language Standard.  JSON defines a small
      set of formatting rules for the portable representation of structured
      data.

Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols (karp)
------------------------------------------------------

  "Database of Long-Lived Symmetric Cryptographic Keys", Russ Housley, Tim
  Polk, Sam Hartman, Dacheng Zhang, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-karp-crypto-key-table-08.txt>

      This document specifies the information contained in a conceptual
      database of long-lived cryptographic keys used by many different
      security protocols.  The database is designed to support both manual
      and automated key management.  In addition to describing the schema
      for the database, this document describes the operations that can be
      performed on the database as well as the requirements for the
      security protocols that wish to use the database.  In many typical
      scenarios, the security protocols do not directly use the long-lived
      key, but rather a key derivation function is used to derive a short-
      lived key from a long-lived key.

  "Operations Model for Router Keying", Sam Hartman, Dacheng Zhang,
  2013-07-05, <draft-ietf-karp-ops-model-07.txt>

      Developing an operational and management model for routing protocol
      security that works with all the routing protocols will be critical
      to the success of routing protocol security efforts.  This document
      discusses issues and begins to consider development of these models.

Common Authentication Technology Next Generation (kitten)
---------------------------------------------------------

  "SAML Enhanced Client SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms", Scott Cantor, Simon
  Josefsson, 2013-05-13, <draft-ietf-kitten-sasl-saml-ec-09.txt>

      Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 is a generalized
      framework for the exchange of security-related information between
      asserting and relying parties.  Simple Authentication and Security
      Layer (SASL) and the Generic Security Service Application Program
      Interface (GSS-API) are application frameworks to facilitate an
      extensible authentication model.  This document specifies a SASL and
      GSS-API mechanism for SAML 2.0 that leverages the capabilities of a
      SAML-aware "enhanced client" to address significant barriers to
      federated authentication in a manner that encourages reuse of
      existing SAML bindings and profiles designed for non-browser
      scenarios.

  "A set of SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms for OAuth", William Mills, Tim
  Showalter, Hannes Tschofenig, 2013-02-24,
  <draft-ietf-kitten-sasl-oauth-10.txt>

      OAuth enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to a
      protected resource, either on behalf of a resource owner by
      orchestrating an approval interaction, or by allowing the third-party
      application to obtain access on its own behalf.
      
      This document defines how an application client uses credentials
      obtained via OAuth over the Simple Authentication and Security Layer
      (SASL) or the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface
      (GSS-API) to access a protected resource at a resource serve.
      Thereby, it enables schemes defined within the OAuth framework for
      non-HTTP-based application protocols.
      
      Clients typically store the user's long-term credential.  This does,
      however, lead to significant security vulnerabilities, for example,
      when such a credential leaks.  A significant benefit of OAuth for
      usage in those clients is that the password is replaced by a token.
      Tokens typically provided limited access rights and can be managed
      and revoked separately from the user's long-term credential
      (password).

  "Kerberos Authorization Data Container Authenticated by Multiple MACs",
  Simo Sorce, Tom Yu, Thomas Hardjono, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-krb-wg-cammac-05.txt>

      Abstract: This document specifies a Kerberos Authorization Data
      container that supersedes AD-KDC-ISSUED.  It allows for multiple
      Message Authentication Codes (MACs) or signatures to authenticate the
      contained Authorization Data elements.

  "Move Kerberos protocol parameter registries to IANA", Tom Yu,
  2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-kitten-kerberos-iana-registries-02.txt>

      The Keberos 5 network authentication protocol has several numeric
      protocol parameters.  Most of these parameters are not currently
      under IANA maintenance.  This document requests that IANA take over
      the maintenance of the remainder of these Kerberos parameters.

  "Initial and Pass Through Authentication Using Kerberos V5 and the GSS-
  API (IAKERB)", Jim Schaad, Larry Zhu, Jeffrey Altman, 2013-04-10,
  <draft-ietf-kitten-iakerb-00.txt>

      This document defines extensions to the Kerberos protocol and the
      GSS-API Kerberos mechanism that enable a GSS-API Kerberos client to
      exchange messages with the KDC using the GSS-API acceptor as the
      proxy, by encapsulating the Kerberos messages inside GSS-API tokens.
      With these extensions a client can obtain Kerberos tickets for
      services where the KDC is not accessible to the client, but is
      accessible to the application server.

  "AES Encryption with HMAC-SHA2 for Kerberos 5", Kelley Burgin, Michael
  Peck, 2013-06-28, <draft-ietf-kitten-aes-cts-hmac-sha2-01.txt>

      This document specifies two encryption types and two corresponding
      checksum types for Kerberos 5.  The new types use AES in CTS mode
      (CBC mode with ciphertext stealing) for confidentiality and HMAC with
      a SHA-2 hash for integrity.

  "Channel Binding Signalling for the Generic Security Services
  Application Programming Interface", Nico Williams, 2013-07-07,
  <draft-ietf-kitten-channel-bound-flag-00.txt>

      Channel binding is a technique that allows applications to use a
      secure channel at a lower layer without having to use authentication
      at that lower layer.  The concept of channel binding comes from the
      Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-
      API).  It turns out that the semantics commonly implemented are
      different that those specified in the base GSS-API RFC (RFC2743), and
      that that specification has a serious bug.  This document addresses
      both, the inconsistency as-implemented and the specification bug.
      
      This Internet-Draft proposes the addition of a "channel bound" return
      flag for the GSS_Init_sec_context() and GSS_Accept_sec_context()
      functions.  Two behaviors are specified: a default, safe behavior
      reflecting existing implementation deployments, and a behavior that
      is only safe when the application specifically tells the GSS-API that
      it (the application) supports the new behavior.  Additional API
      elements related to this are also added, including a new security
      context establishment API.

Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (l2vpn)
----------------------------------------

  "IP-Only LAN Service (IPLS)", Himanshu Shah, Eric Rosen, Francois Le
  Faucheur, Giles Heron, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-ipls-12.txt>

      A Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [VPLS] is used to interconnect
      systems across a wide-area or metropolitan-area network, making it
      appear that they are on a private LAN.  The systems which are
      interconnected may themselves be LAN switches.  If, however, they
      are IP hosts or IP routers, certain simplifications to the operation
      of the VPLS are possible.  We call this simplified type of VPLS an
      "IP-only LAN Service" (IPLS).  In an IPLS, as in a VPLS, LAN
      interfaces are run in promiscuous mode, and frames are forwarded
      based on their destination MAC addresses.  However, the maintenance
      of the MAC forwarding tables is done via signaling, rather than via
      the MAC address learning procedures specified in [IEEE 802.1D].
      This draft specifies the protocol extensions and procedures for
      support of the IPLS service.

  "Multicast in VPLS", Rahul Aggarwal, Yakov Rekhter, Yuji Kamite, Luyuan
  Fang, 2013-07-02, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast-14.txt>

      [RFC4761] and [RFC4762] describe a solution for Virtual Private LAN
      Service (VPLS) multicast that relies on the use of point-to-point or
      multipoint-to-point unicast Label Switched Paths (LSPs) for carrying
      multicast traffic. This solution has certain limitations for certain
      VPLS multicast traffic profiles. For example, it may result in highly
      non-optimal bandwidth utilization when large amount of multicast
      traffic is to be transported.
      
      This document describes a solution for overcoming a subset of the
      limitations of existing VPLS multicast solution. It describes
      procedures for VPLS multicast that utilize multicast trees in the
      service provider (SP) network. The solution described in this
      document allows sharing of one such multicast tree among multiple
      VPLS instances. Furthermore, the solution described in this document
      allows a single multicast tree in the SP network to carry traffic
      belonging only to a specified set of one or more IP multicast streams
      from one or more VPLS instances.

  "PIM Snooping over VPLS", Olivier Dornon, Jayant Kotalwar, Venu Hemige,
  Ray Qiu, Jeffrey Zhang, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-pim-snooping-04.txt>

      This document describes the procedures and recommendations for VPLS
      PEs to facilitate replication of multicast traffic to only certain
      ports (behind which there are interested PIM routers and/or IGMP
      hosts) via PIM Snooping and PIM Proxy.
      
      With PIM Snooping, PEs passively listen to certain PIM control
      messages to build control and forwarding states while transparently
      flooding those messages.  With PIM Proxy, PEs do not flood PIM Join/
      Prune messages but only generate their own and send out of certain
      ports, based on the control states built from downstream Join/Prune
      messages.  PIM Proxy is required when PIM Join suppression is enabled
      on the CE devices and useful to reduce PIM control traffic in a VPLS
      domain.
      
      The document also describes PIM Relay, which can be viewed as light-
      weight proxy, where all downstream Join/Prune messages are simply
      forwarded out of certain ports but not flooded to avoid triggering
      PIM Join suppression on CE devices.

  "Virtual Private Lan Services (VPLS) Management Information Base",
  Thomas Nadeau, Kiran Koushik, Rohit Mediratta, 2013-06-14,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mib-10.txt>

      This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
      Information Base for use with network management protocols in the
      Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects for
      modeling of Virtual Private LAN services. It needs to be used in
      conjunction with Pseudowire (PW) Management Information Base
      [RFC5601].

  "LDP Extensions for Optimized MAC Address Withdrawal in H-VPLS", Pranjal
  Dutta, Florin Balus, Olen Stokes, Geraldine Calvignac, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-ldp-mac-opt-08.txt>

      [RFC4762] describes a mechanism to remove or unlearn MAC addresses
      that have been dynamically learned in a VPLS Instance for faster
      convergence on topology change.  The procedure also removes MAC
      addresses in the VPLS that do not require relearning due to such
      topology change.  This document defines an enhancement to the MAC
      Address Withdrawal procedure with empty MAC List [RFC4762], which
      enables a Provider Edge(PE) device to remove only the MAC addresses
      that need to be relearned.  Additional extensions to [RFC4762] MAC
      Withdrawal procedures are specified to provide optimized MAC flushing
      for the PBB-VPLS specified in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-pbb-vpls-pe-model] .

  "Extensions to VPLS PE model for Provider Backbone Bridging", Florin
  Balus, Ali Sajassi, Nabil Bitar, 2013-06-13,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-pbb-vpls-pe-model-07.txt>

      IEEE 802.1 Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB) [IEEE.802.1Q-2011] defines
      an architecture and bridge protocols for interconnection of multiple
      Provider Bridge Networks (PBNs). PBB was defined in IEEE as a
      connectionless technology based on multipoint VLAN tunnels.  PBB can
      be used to attain better scalability in terms of number of customer
      MAC addresses and number of service instances that can be supported.
      
      Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [RFC4664] provides a framework for
      extending Ethernet LAN services, using MPLS tunneling capabilities,
      through a routed MPLS backbone without running RSTP or MSTP across
      the backbone. As a result, VPLS has been deployed on a large scale in
      service provider networks.
      
      This draft discusses extensions to the VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model
      required to incorporate desirable PBB components while maintaining
      the Service Provider fit of the initial model.

  "BGP based Multi-homing in Virtual Private LAN Service", Bhupesh
  Kothari, Kireeti Kompella, Wim Henderickx, Florin Balus, Jim Uttaro,
  Senad Palislamovic, Wen Lin, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-multihoming-06.txt>

      Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a Layer 2 Virtual Private
      Network (VPN) that gives its customers the appearance that their
      sites are connected via a Local Area Network (LAN).  It is often
      required for the Service Provider (SP) to give the customer redundant
      connectivity to some sites, often called "multi-homing".  This memo
      shows how BGP-based multi-homing can be offered in the context of LDP
      and BGP VPLS solutions.

  "VPLS Interoperability with Provider Backbone Bridges", Ali Sajassi,
  Samer Salam, Nabil Bitar, Florin Balus, 2013-07-10,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-pbb-vpls-interop-05.txt>

      The scalability of H-VPLS with Ethernet access networks can be
      improved by incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge functionality in
      the VPLS access. Provider Backbone Bridging has been standardized as
      IEEE 802.1ah-2008, and aims to improve the scalability of MAC
      addresses and service instances in Provider Ethernet networks. This
      document describes different interoperability scenarios where
      Provider Backbone Bridge functionality is used in H-VPLS with
      Ethernet or MPLS access network to attain better scalability in terms
      of number of customer MAC addresses and number of service instances.
      The document also describes the scenarios and the mechanisms for
      incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge functionality within H-VPLS
      with existing Ethernet access and interoperability among them.
      Furthermore, the document discusses the migration mechanisms and
      scenarios by which Provider Backbone Bridge functionality can be
      incorporated into H-VPLS with existing MPLS access.

  "MAC Flush Loop Detection in VPLS", Paul Kwok, Pranjal Dutta,
  2013-03-31, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-macflush-ld-03.txt>

      MAC Address Withdrawal is a mechanism described in [RFC4762] to
      remove or unlearn MAC addresses that have been dynamically learned in
      a VPLS instance, for faster convergence on topology change.  Failure
      of mechanisms that control loop free connectivity among VPLS PE-rs
      nodes may cause MAC Address Withdrawal messages looping among those
      nodes, leading to Denial of Service (DoS) or complete failure of
      control plane in the PE-rs nodes.  This document describes a
      mechanism to detect and prevent loops of MAC Address Withdrawal
      messages in a VPLS PE-rs node on such failures.

  "Extension to LDP-VPLS for Ethernet Broadcast and Multicast", Frederic
  JOUNAY, Yuji Kamite, Zhihua Liu, Manuel Paul, Ruediger Kunze, Mach Chen,
  Lizhong Jin, 2013-02-22,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-ldp-vpls-broadcast-exten-05.txt>

      This document proposes a simple extension to LDP-VPLS to improve
      bandwidth efficiency for Ethernet broadcast/multicast traffic
      within a carrier's network. It makes use of unidirectional
      point-to-multipoint PseudoWires to minimise payload frame duplication
      on physical links.

  "Requirements for Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree)
  Support in L2VPN", Simon DeLord, Frederic JOUNAY, Lu Huang, Zhihua Liu,
  Manuel Paul, 2013-07-29, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-etree-reqt-05.txt>

      This document provides functional requirements for Metro Ethernet
      Forum (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) support in multipoint L2VPN
      solutions (referred to as simply L2VPN). It is intended that
      potential solutions will use these requirements as guidelines.

  "A Framework for E-Tree Service over MPLS Network", Simon DeLord,
  Frederic JOUNAY, Lucy Yong, Lizhong Jin, Yuji Kamite, Wim Henderickx,
  2013-02-22, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-etree-frwk-02.txt>

      This document proposes a solution framework for supporting Metro
      Ethernet Forum (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) services over a
      Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network. The objective is to
      provide a simple and effective approach to emulate E-Tree services
      in addition to Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) services on an existing MPLS
      network.

      This document describes procedures for BGP MPLS based Ethernet VPNs
      (EVPN).

  "PBB-EVPN", Ali Sajassi, Samer Salam, Sami Boutros, Nabil Bitar, Aldrin
  Isaac, Lizhong Jin, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-pbb-evpn-05.txt>

      This document discusses how Ethernet Provider Backbone Bridging
      [802.1ah] can be combined with EVPN in order to reduce the number of
      BGP MAC advertisement routes by aggregating Customer/Client MAC (C-
      MAC) addresses via Provider Backbone MAC address (B-MAC), provide
      client MAC address mobility using C-MAC aggregation and B-MAC sub-
      netting, confine the scope of C-MAC learning to only active flows,
      offer per site policies and avoid C-MAC address flushing on topology
      changes. The combined solution is referred to as PBB-EVPN.

  "Requirements for Ethernet VPN (EVPN)", Ali Sajassi, Rahul Aggarwal,
  Nabil Bitar, Aldrin Isaac, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-evpn-req-04.txt>

      The widespread adoption of Ethernet L2VPN services and the advent of
      new applications for the technology (e.g., data center interconnect)
      have culminated in a new set of requirements that are not readily
      addressable by the current Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)
      solution. In particular, multi-homing with all-active forwarding is
      not supported and there's no existing solution to leverage
      Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs for optimizing the delivery of
      multi-destination frames. Furthermore, the provisioning of VPLS, even
      in the context of BGP-based auto-discovery, requires network
      operators to specify various network parameters on top of the access
      configuration. This document specifies the requirements for an
      Ethernet VPN (EVPN) solution which addresses the above issues.

  "Redundancy provisioning for VPLS Inter-domain", Zhihua Liu, Lizhong
  Jin, Ran Chen, Dennis Cai, Samer Salam, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-inter-domain-redundancy-02.txt>

      In many VPLS deployments based on [RFC4762], inter-domain
      connectivity has been deployed without node redundancy, or with node
      redundancy in a single domain.  This document describes a solution
      for inter-domain VPLS based on RFC4762 with node and link redundancy
      in both domains.

  "MVPN: Using Bidirectional P-Tunnels", Eric Rosen, IJsbrand Wijnands,
  Yiqun Cai, Arjen Boers, 2013-04-10, <draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-bidir-05.txt>

      A set of prior RFCs specify procedures for supporting multicast in
      BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  These procedures allow customer multicast data to
      travel across a service provider's backbone network through a set of
      multicast tunnels.  The tunnels are advertised in certain BGP "auto-
      discovery" routes, by means of a BGP attribute known as the "Provider
      Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) Tunnel attribute".  Encodings have
      been defined that allow the PMSI Tunnel attribute to identify
      bidirectional (multipoint-to-multipoint) multicast distribution
      trees.  However, the prior RFCs do not provide all the necessary
      procedures for using bidirectional tunnels to support multicast VPNs.
      This document updates RFCs 6513 and 6625 by specifying those
      procedures.  In particular, it specifies the procedures for assigning
      customer multicast flows (unidirectional or bidirectional) to
      specific bidirectional tunnels in the provider backbone, for
      advertising such assignments, and for determining which flows have
      been assigned to which tunnels.

  "Virtual Hub-and-Spoke in BGP/MPLS VPNs", Huajin Jeng, Jim Uttaro, Luay
  Jalil, Bruno Decraene, Yakov Rekhter, Rahul Aggarwal, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-ietf-l3vpn-virtual-hub-08.txt>

      With BGP/MPLS VPNs, providing any-to-any connectivity among sites of
      a given Virtual Private Network would require each Provider Edge
      router that has one or more of these sites connected to it to hold
      all the routes of that Virtual Private Network. The approach
      described in this document allows the VPN service provider to reduce
      the number of Provider Edge routers that have to maintain all these
      routes by requiring only a subset of these routers to maintain all
      these routes.
      
      Furthermore, when Provider Edge routers use ingress replication to
      carry multicast traffic of VPN customers, the approach described in
      this document may under certain circumstances allow to reduce
      bandwidth inefficiency associated with ingress replication, and to
      redistribute the replication load among Provider Edge routers.

  "MPLS/BGP Layer 3 VPN Multicast Management Information Base", Saud Asif,
  Andy Green, Sameer Gulrajani, Pradeep Jain, Jeffrey Zhang, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-mib-02.txt>

      This memo defines an portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
      
      In particular, it describes managed objects to configure and/or
      monitor multicast in MPLS/BGP-based Layer-3 VPN (MVPN) on an MVPN
      router.

  "BGP-signaled end-system IP/VPNs.", Pedro Marques, Luyuan Fang, Ping
  Pan, Amit Shukla, Maria Napierala, Nabil Bitar, 2013-04-01,
  <draft-ietf-l3vpn-end-system-01.txt>

      This document describes a solution in which the control plane
      protocol specified in BGP/MPLS IP VPNs [RFC4364] is used to provide a
      Virtual Network service to end-systems.  These end-systems may be
      used to provide network services or may directly host end-to-end
      applications.

  "Encoding mLDP FECs in the NLRI of BGP MCAST-VPN Routes", IJsbrand
  Wijnands, Eric Rosen, Uwe Joorde, 2013-05-15,
  <draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-mldp-nlri-01.txt>

      Many service providers offer "BGP/MPLS IP VPN" service to their
      customers.  Existing IETF standards specify the procedures and
      protocols that a service provider uses in order to offer this service
      to customers who have IP unicast and IP multicast traffic in their
      VPNs.  It is also desirable to be able to support customers who have
      MPLS multicast traffic in their VPNs.  This document specifies the
      procedures and protocol extensions that are needed to support
      customers who use the Multicast Extensions to Label Distribution
      Protocol (mLDP) as the control protocol for their MPLS multicast
      traffic.  Existing standards do provide some support for customers
      who use mLDP, but only under a restrictive set of circumstances.
      This document generalizes the existing support to include all cases
      where the customer uses mLDP, without any restrictions.

  "Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol In-Band Signaling in a VRF
  Context", IJsbrand Wijnands, Paul Hitchen, Nicolai Leymann, Wim
  Henderickx,  arkadiy.gulko@thomsonreuters.com, 2013-06-21,
  <draft-ietf-l3vpn-mldp-vrf-in-band-signaling-01.txt>

      Sometimes an IP multicast distribution tree (MDT) traverses both
      MPLS-enabled and non-MPLS-enabled regions of a network.  Typically
      the MDT begins and ends in non-MPLS regions, but travels through an
      MPLS region.  In such cases, it can be useful to begin building the
      MDT as a pure IP MDT, then convert it to an MPLS Multipoint LSP
      (Label Switched Path) when it enters an MPLS-enabled region, and then
      convert it back to a pure IP MDT when it enters a non-MPLS-enabled
      region.  Other documents specify the procedures for building such a
      hybrid MDT, using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) in the non-
      MPLS region of the network, and using Multipoint Extensions to Label
      Distribution Protocol (mLDP) in the MPLS region.  This document
      extends those procedures to handle the case where the link connecting
      the two regions is a "Virtual Routing and Forwarding Table" (VRF)
      link, as defined in the "BGP IP/MPLS VPN" specifications.  However,
      this document is primarily aimed at particular use cases where VRFs
      are used to support multicast applications other than Multicast VPN.

  "Extranet Multicast in BGP/IP MPLS VPNs", Yakov Rekhter, Eric Rosen,
  Rahul Aggarwal, Yiqun Cai, Wim Henderickx, Thomas Morin, Praveen Muley,
  Ray Qiu, IJsbrand Wijnands, 2013-08-06,
  <draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-extranet-02.txt>

      Previous RFCs specify the procedures necessary to allow IP multicast
      traffic to travel from one site to another within a BGP/MPLS IP VPN
      (Virtual Private Network).  However, it is sometimes desirable to
      allow multicast traffic whose source is in one VPN to be received by
      systems that are in another VPN.  This is known as a "Multicast VPN
      (MVPN) extranet".  This document updates RFCs 6513, 6514, and 6625 by
      specifying the procedures that are necessary in order to provide MVPN
      extranet service.

Locator/ID Separation Protocol (lisp)
-------------------------------------

  "LISP MIB", Gregg Schudel, Amit Jain, Victor Moreno, 2013-06-17,
  <draft-ietf-lisp-mib-11.txt>

      This document defines the MIB module that contains managed objects to
      support the monitoring devices that support the Locator/ID Separation
      Protocol (LISP).  These objects provide information useful for
      monitoring LISP devices, including determining basic LISP
      configuration information, LISP functional status, and operational
      counters and other statistics.

  "LISP Network Element Deployment Considerations", Lorand Jakab, Albert
  Cabellos-Aparicio, Florin Coras, Jordi Domingo-Pascual, Darrel Lewis,
  2013-08-06, <draft-ietf-lisp-deployment-10.txt>

      This document is a snapshot of different Locator/Identifier
      Separation Protocol (LISP) deployment scenarios.  It discusses the
      placement of new network elements introduced by the protocol,
      representing the thinking of the authors as of Summer 2013.  LISP
      deployment scenarios may have evolved since.  This memo represents
      one stable point in that evolution of understanding.

  "LISP EID Block", Luigi Iannone, Darrel Lewis, David Meyer, Vince
  Fuller, 2013-02-25, <draft-ietf-lisp-eid-block-04.txt>

      This is a direction to IANA to allocate a /16 IPv6 prefix for use
      with the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP).  The prefix will be
      used for local intra-domain routing and global endpoint
      identification, by sites deploying LISP as EID (Endpoint IDentifier)
      addressing space.

  "LISP Threats Analysis", Damien Saucez, Luigi Iannone, Olivier
  Bonaventure, 2013-02-25, <draft-ietf-lisp-threats-04.txt>

      This document analyzes the potential threats against the security of
      the Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) if deployed in the
      Internet.  This document proposes a set of recommendations to
      mitigate the identified security risks and keep a security level
      equivalent to what is observed in the Internet today (i.e., without
      LISP).  By following the recommendations of this draft a LISP
      deployment can achieve a security level that is comparable to the
      existing Internet architecture.

  "LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF)", Dino Farinacci, David Meyer, Job
  Snijders, 2013-03-10, <draft-ietf-lisp-lcaf-02.txt>

      This draft defines a canonical address format encoding used in LISP
      control messages and in the encoding of lookup keys for the LISP
      Mapping Database System.

  "LISP Delegated Database Tree", Vince Fuller, Darrel Lewis, Vina
  Ermagan, Amit Jain, 2013-03-28, <draft-ietf-lisp-ddt-01.txt>

      This draft describes the LISP Delegated Database Tree (LISP-DDT), a
      hierarchical, distributed database which embodies the delegation of
      authority to provide mappings from LISP Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs)
      to Routing Locators (RLOCs).  It is a statically-defined distribution
      of the EID namespace among a set of LISP-speaking servers, called DDT
      nodes.  Each DDT node is configured as "authoritative" for one or
      more EID-prefixes, along with the set of RLOCs for Map Servers or
      "child" DDT nodes to which more-specific EID-prefixes are delegated.

  "An Architecural Introduction to the LISP Location-Identity Separation
  System", J. Chiappa, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-lisp-introduction-01.txt>

      LISP is an upgrade to the architecture of the IPvN internetworking
      system, one which separates location and identity (currently
      intermingled in IPvN addresses).  This is a change which has been
      identified by the IRTF as a critically necessary evolutionary
      architectural step for the Internet.  In LISP, nodes have both a
      'locator' (a name which says _where_ in the network's connectivity
      structure the node is) and an 'identifier' (a name which serves only
      to provide a persistent handle for the node).  A node may have more
      than one locator, or its locator may change over time (e.g. if the
      node is mobile), but it keeps the same identifier.
      
      One of the chief novelties of LISP, compared to other proposals for
      the separation of location and identity, is its approach to deploying
      this upgrade.  (In general, it is comparatively easy to conceive of
      new network designs, but much harder to devise approaches which will
      actually get deployed throughout the global network.)  LISP aims to
      achieve the near-ubiquitous deployment necessary for maximum
      exploitation of an architectural upgrade by i) minimizing the amount
      of change needed (existing hosts and routers can operate unmodified);
      and ii) by providing significant benefits to early adopters.
      
      This document is an introduction to the entire LISP system, for those
      who are unfamiliar with it.

  "An Architectural Perspective on the LISP Location-Identity Separation
  System", J. Chiappa, 2013-02-18, <draft-ietf-lisp-perspective-00.txt>

      LISP upgrades the architecture of the IPvN internetworking system by
      separating location and identity, current intermingled in IPvN
      addresses.  This is a change which has been identified by the IRTF as
      a critically necessary evolutionary architectural step for the
      Internet.  In LISP, nodes have both a 'locator' (a name which says
      _where_ in the network's connectivity structure the node is) and an
      'identifier' (a name which serves only to provide a persistent handle
      for the node).  A node may have more than one locator, or its locator
      may change over time (e.g. if the node is mobile), but it keeps the
      same identifier.
      
      This document gives additional architectural insight into LISP, and
      considers a number of aspects of LISP from a high-level standpoint.
      
      [NOTE: This is still a somewhat rough draft version; a few sections
      at the end are just rough frameworks, but almost all the key
      sections, and all the front part of the document, are here, and in
      something like reasonably complete form.]

Light-Weight Implementation Guidance (lwig)
-------------------------------------------

  "Guidance for Light-Weight Implementations of the Internet Protocol
  Suite", Carsten Bormann, 2013-02-25, <draft-ietf-lwig-guidance-03.txt>

      Implementation of Internet protocols on small devices benefits from
      light-weight implementation techniques, which are often not
      documented in an accessible way.
      
      This document provides a first outline of and some initial content
      for the Light-Weight Implementation Guidance document planned by the
      IETF working group LWIG.

  "Terminology for Constrained Node Networks", Carsten Bormann, Mehmet
  Ersue, Ari Keranen, 2013-07-09, <draft-ietf-lwig-terminology-05.txt>

      The Internet Protocol Suite is increasingly used on small devices
      with severe constraints, creating constrained node networks.  This
      document provides a number of basic terms that have turned out to be
      useful in the standardization work for constrained environments.

  "Minimal IKEv2", Tero Kivinen, 2013-04-11,
  <draft-ietf-lwig-ikev2-minimal-00.txt>

      This document describes minimal version of the Internet Key Exchange
      version 2 (IKEv2) protocol.  IKEv2 is a component of IPsec used for
      performing mutual authentication and establishing and maintaining
      Security Associations (SAs).  IKEv2 includes several optional
      features, which are not needed in minimal implementations.  This
      document describes what is required from the minimal implementation,
      and also describes various optimizations which can be done.  The
      protocol described here is compliant with full IKEv2 with exception
      that this document only describes shared secret authentication (IKEv2
      requires support for certificate authentication in addition to shared
      secret authentication).
      
      This document does not update or modify RFC 5996, but provides more
      compact description of the minimal version of the protocol.  If this
      document and RFC 5996 conflicts then RFC 5996 is the authoritative
      description.

Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (manet)
------------------------------

  "The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2", Thomas Clausen,
  Christopher Dearlove, Philippe Jacquet, Ulrich Herberg, 2013-03-23,
  <draft-ietf-manet-olsrv2-19.txt>

      This specification describes version 2 of the Optimized Link State
      Routing (OLSRv2) protocol for Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs).

  "Definition of Managed Objects for the Manet Simplified Multicast
  Framework Relay Set Process", Robert Cole, Joseph Macker, Brian Adamson,
  2013-03-21, <draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-07.txt,.pdf>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
      In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of the
      Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) process for Mobile Ad-Hoc
      Networks (MANETs).  The SMF-MIB also reports state information,
      performance metrics, and notifications.  In addition to
      configuration, the additional state and performance information is
      useful to operators troubleshooting multicast forwarding problems.

  "Definition of Managed Objects for the Optimized Link State Routing
  Protocol version 2", Ulrich Herberg, Robert Cole, Thomas Clausen,
  2013-06-24, <draft-ietf-manet-olsrv2-mib-12.txt>

      This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module
      for configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing
      protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).  The OLSRv2-MIB module is structured
      into configuration information, state information, performance
      information, and notifications.  This additional state and
      performance information is useful to troubleshoot problems and
      performance issues of the routing protocol.  Two levels of compliance
      allow this MIB module to be deployed on constrained routers.

  "Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP)", Stan Ratliff, Cisco Cisco, Greg
  Harrison, Darryl Satterwhite, Shawn Jury, 2013-03-25,
  <draft-ietf-manet-dlep-04.txt>

      When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over
      wireless links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the
      characteristics of the link (speed, state, etc.) in order to make
      forwarding decisions. In mobile or other environments where these
      characteristics change frequently, manual configurations or the
      inference of state through routing or transport protocols does not
      allow the router to make the best decisions. A bidirectional, event-
      driven communication channel between the router and the modem is
      necessary.

  "Security Threats for NHDP", Jiazi Yi, Ulrich Herberg, Thomas Clausen,
  2013-06-17, <draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-sec-threats-06.txt>

      This document analyzes common security threats of the Neighborhood
      Discovery Protocol (NHDP), and describes their potential impacts on
      MANET routing protocols using NHDP.  This document is not intended to
      propose solutions to the threats described.

  "Link Metrics for the Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Routing Protocol
  OLSRv2 - Rationale", Christopher Dearlove, Thomas Clausen, Philippe
  Jacquet, 2013-05-01, <draft-ietf-manet-olsrv2-metrics-rationale-04.txt>

      OLSRv2 includes the ability to assign metrics to links and to use
      those metrics to allow routing by other than minimum hop count
      routes.  This document provides a historic record of the rationale
      for, and design considerations behind, how link metrics were included
      in OLSRv2.

  "Dynamic MANET On-demand (AODVv2) Routing", Charles Perkins, Stan
  Ratliff, John Dowdell, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-manet-aodvv2-02.txt>

      The revised Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODVv2) routing
      protocol is intended for use by mobile routers in wireless, multihop
      networks.  AODVv2 determines unicast routes among AODVv2 routers
      within the network in an on-demand fashion, offering on-demand
      convergence in dynamic topologies.

  "Integrity Check Value and Timestamp TLV Definitions for Mobile Ad Hoc
  Networks (MANETs)", Ulrich Herberg, Thomas Clausen, Christopher
  Dearlove, 2013-07-30, <draft-ietf-manet-rfc6622-bis-04.txt>

      This document revises, extends and replaces RFC 6622.  It describes
      general and flexible TLVs for representing cryptographic Integrity
      Check Values (ICVs) and timestamps, using the generalized Mobile Ad
      Hoc Network (MANET) packet/message format defined in RFC 5444.  It
      defines two Packet TLVs, two Message TLVs, and two Address Block TLVs
      for affixing ICVs and timestamps to a packet, a message, and one or
      more addresses, respectively.

  "Integrity Protection for Control Messages in NHDP and OLSRv2", Ulrich
  Herberg, Christopher Dearlove, Thomas Clausen, 2013-07-02,
  <draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-olsrv2-sec-03.txt>

      This document specifies integrity and replay protection for the MANET
      Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) and the Optimized Link State
      Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).  This protection is achieved by
      using an HMAC-SHA-256 Integrity Check Value (ICV) TLV and a timestamp
      TLV based on POSIX time.
      
      The mechanism in this specification can also be used for other
      protocols that use the generalized packet/message format described in
      RFC 5444.
      
      This document updates RFC 6130 and RFC xxxx by mandating the
      implementation of this integrity and replay protection in NHDP and
      OLSRv2.

MBONE Deployment (mboned)
-------------------------

  "Automatic Multicast Tunneling", Gregory Bumgardner, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-mboned-auto-multicast-15.txt>

      This document describes Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT), a
      protocol for delivering multicast traffic from sources in a
      multicast-enabled network to receivers that lack multicast
      connectivity to the source network.  The protocol uses UDP
      encapsulation and unicast replication to provide this functionality.
      
      The AMT protocol is specifically designed to support rapid deployment
      by requiring minimal changes to existing network infrastructure.

  "Mtrace Version 2: Traceroute Facility for IP Multicast", Hitoshi
  Asaeda, Weesan Lee, 2013-07-08, <draft-ietf-mboned-mtrace-v2-10.txt>

      This document describes the IP multicast traceroute facility, named
      Mtrace version 2 (Mtrace2).  Unlike unicast traceroute, Mtrace2
      requires special implementations on the part of routers.  This
      specification describes the required functionality in multicast
      routers, as well as how an Mtrace2 client invokes a query and
      receives a reply.

  "IPv6 Multicast Address With Embedded IPv4 Multicast Address", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Jacni Qin, Yiu Lee, Stig Venaas, Xing Li, Mingwei Xu,
  2013-04-18, <draft-ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format-05.txt>

      This document reserves one bit (M-bit) of the unicast prefix-based
      multicast IPv6 address for ASM and an IPv6 multicast prefix for SSM
      mode to be used in the context of IPv4-IPv6 interconnection.
      
      The document specifies an algorithmic translation of an IPv6
      multicast address to a corresponding IPv4 multicast address, and vice
      versa.  This algorithmic translation can be used in both IPv4-IPv6
      translation or encapsulation schemes.

  "IPv4-IPv6 Multicast: Problem Statement and Use Cases", Christian
  Jacquenet, Mohamed Boucadair, Yiu Lee, Jacni Qin, Tina Tsou, Qiong Sun,
  2013-06-05, <draft-ietf-mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps-03.txt>

      This document discusses issues and requirements raised by IPv4-IPv6
      multicast interconnection and co-existence scenarios.  It also
      discusses various multicast use cases which may occur during IPv6
      transitioning.

  "Address Acquisition For Multicast Content When Source and Receiver
  Support Differing IP Versions", Tina Tsou, Axel Clauberg, Mohamed
  Boucadair, Stig Venaas, Qiong Sun, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-ietf-mboned-multrans-addr-acquisition-02.txt>

      Each IPTV operator has their own arrangements for pre-provisioning
      program information including addresses of the multicast groups
      corresponding to broadcast programs on the subscriber receiver.
      During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, scenarios can occur where
      the IP version supported by the receiver differs from that supported
      by the source.  This memo examines what has to be done to allow the
      receiver to acquire multicast address information in the version it
      supports in such scenarios.

  "Multicast in the Data Center Overview", Mike McBride, 2013-02-19,
  <draft-ietf-mboned-dc-deploy-00.txt>

      There has been much interest in issues surrounding massive amounts of
      hosts in the data center.  These issues include the prevalent use of
      IP Multicast within the Data Center.  Its important to understand how
      IP Multicast is being deployed in the Data Center to be able to
      understand the surrounding issues with doing so.  This document
      provides a quick survey of uses of multicast in the data center and
      should serve as an aid to further discussion of issues related to
      large amounts of multicast in the data center.

Media Server Control (mediactrl)
--------------------------------

  "Media Control Channel Framework (CFW) Call Flow Examples", Alessandro
  Amirante, Tobia Castaldi, Lorenzo Miniero, Simon Romano, 2013-05-23,
  <draft-ietf-mediactrl-call-flows-13.txt>

      This document provides a list of typical Media Control Channel
      Framework call flows.  It aims at being a simple guide to the use of
      the interface between Application Servers and MEDIACTRL-based Media
      Servers, as well as a base reference documentation for both
      implementors and protocol researchers.

Multiple Interfaces (mif)
-------------------------

  "Happy Eyeballs Extension for Multiple Interfaces", Gang Chen, Carl
  Williams, Dan Wing, Andrew Yourtchenko, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-mif-happy-eyeballs-extension-02.txt>

      Currently the interface selection in multi-interface environment is
      exclusive - only one interface can be used at the time, frequently
      needing manual intervention.  Happy Eyeballs in MIF would make the
      selection process smoother by using the connectivity checks over a
      pre-filtered interfaces according to defined policy.  This would
      choose "best" interface with an automatic fallback.

Managed Incident Lightweight Exchange (mile)
--------------------------------------------

  "IODEF-extension for structured cybersecurity information", Takeshi
  Takahashi, Kent Landfield, Tom Millar, Youki Kadobayashi, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-ietf-mile-sci-08.txt,.pdf>

      This document extends the Incident Object Description Exchange Format
      (IODEF) defined in RFC 5070 [RFC5070] to exchange enriched
      cybersecurity information among cybersecurity entities and facilitate

  "IODEF Usage Guidance", Panos Kampanakis, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-mile-iodef-guidance-01.txt>

      The Incident Object Description Exchange Format [RFC5070] defines a
      data representation that provides a framework for sharing information
      commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams
      (CSIRTs) about computer security incidents.  Since the IODEF model
      includes a wealth of available options that can be used to describe a
      security incident or issue, it can be challenging for implementers to
      develop tools that can Leverage IODEF for incident sharing.  This
      document provides guidelines for IODEF implementers.  It will also
      address how common security indicators can be represented in IODEF.
      The goal of this document is to make IODEF's adoption by vendors
      easier and encourage faster and wider adoption of the model by
      Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) around the world.

  "The Incident Object Description Exchange Format", Roman Danyliw, Paul
  Stoecker, 2013-05-05, <draft-ietf-mile-rfc5070-bis-00.txt>

      The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a
      data representation that provides a framework for sharing information
      commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams
      (CSIRTs) about computer security incidents.  This document describes
      the information model for the IODEF and provides an associated data
      model specified with XML Schema.

  "IODEF Enumeration Reference Format", Adam Montville, David Black,
  2013-07-30, <draft-ietf-mile-enum-reference-format-01.txt>

      The Incident Object Description Exchange Format [IODEF] provides a
      Reference class used to reference external entities (such as
      enumeration identifiers).  However, the method of external entity
      identification has been left unstructured.  This document describes a
      method to provide structure for referencing external entities for the
      [IODEF] Reference class.

Mobility for IPv4 (mip4)
------------------------

  "Flow Binding Support for Mobile IPv4", Sri Gundavelli, Kent Leung,
  George Tsirtsis, Hesham Soliman, Alexandru Petrescu, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-mip4-multiple-tunnel-support-06.txt>

      This specification defines extensions to Mobile IPv4 protocol for
      allowing a mobile node with multiple interfaces to register a care-of
      address for each of its network interfaces and to simultaneously
      establish multiple Mobile IP tunnels with its home agent.  This
      essentially allows the mobile node to utilize all the available
      network interfaces and build an higher aggregated data pipe with the
      home agent for its home address traffic.  Furthermore, these
      extensions also allow the mobile node and the home agent to negotiate
      flow policies for binding individual traffic flows with the
      registered care-of addresses.

Multiparty Multimedia Session Control (mmusic)
----------------------------------------------

  "Real Time Streaming Protocol 2.0 (RTSP)", Henning Schulzrinne, Anup
  Rao, Rob Lanphier, Magnus Westerlund, Martin Stiemerling, 2013-04-04,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis-34.txt>

      This memorandum defines RTSP version 2.0 which obsoletes RTSP version
      1.0 defined in RFC 2326.
      
      The Real Time Streaming Protocol, or RTSP, is an application-level
      protocol for setup and control of the delivery of data with real-time
      properties.  RTSP provides an extensible framework to enable
      controlled, on-demand delivery of real-time data, such as audio and
      video.  Sources of data can include both live data feeds and stored
      clips.  This protocol is intended to control multiple data delivery
      sessions, provide a means for choosing delivery channels such as UDP,
      multicast UDP and TCP, and provide a means for choosing delivery
      mechanisms based upon RTP (RFC 3550).

  "A Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal mechanism for media
  controlled by Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)", Jeff Goldberg,
  Magnus Westerlund, Thomas Zeng, 2013-05-27,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-rtsp-nat-16.txt>

      This document defines a solution for Network Address Translation
      (NAT) traversal for datagram based media streams setup and controlled
      with Real-time Streaming Protocol version 2 (RTSP 2.0).  It uses
      Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) adapted to use RTSP as a
      signalling channel, defining the necessary extra RTSP extensions and
      procedures.

  "The Evaluation of Different Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal
  Techniques for Media Controlled by Real-time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)",
  Magnus Westerlund, Thomas Zeng, 2013-05-29,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-rtsp-nat-evaluation-09.txt>

      This document describes several Network Address Translator (NAT)
      traversal techniques that were considered to be used for establishing
      the RTP media flows controlled by the Real-time Streaming Protocol
      (RTSP).  Each technique includes a description on how it would be
      used, the security implications of using it and any other deployment
      considerations it has.  There are also discussions on how NAT
      traversal techniques relates to firewalls and how each technique can
      be applied in different use cases.  These findings where used when
      selecting the NAT traversal for RTSP 2.0.

  "SDP: Session Description Protocol", Mark Handley, Van Jacobson, Colin
  Perkins, Ali Begen, 2013-03-11, <draft-ietf-mmusic-rfc4566bis-08.txt>

      This memo defines the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  SDP is
      intended for describing multimedia sessions for the purposes of
      session announcement, session invitation, and other forms of
      multimedia session initiation.  This document obsoletes RFC 4566.

  "Analysis of Middlebox Interactions for Signaling Protocol Communication
  along the Media Path", Brian Stucker, Hannes Tschofenig, Gonzalo
  Salgueiro, 2013-05-30, <draft-ietf-mmusic-media-path-middleboxes-07.txt>

      Middleboxes are defined as any intermediary box performing functions
      apart from normal, standard functions of an IP router on the data
      path between a source host and destination host.  Two such functions
      are network address translation and firewalling.
      
      When Application Layer Gateways, such as SIP entities, interact with
      NATs and firewalls, as described in the MIDCOM architecture, then
      problems may occur in the transport of media traffic when signaling
      protocol interaction takes place along the media path, as it is the
      case for recent key exchange proposals (such as DTLS-SRTP).  This
      document highlights problems that may arise.  Unfortunately, it is
      difficult for the end points to detect or predict problematic
      behavior and to determine whether the media path is reliably
      available for packet exchange.
      
      This document aims to summarize the various sources and effects of
      NAT and firewall control, the reasons that they exist, and possible
      means of improving their behavior to allow protocols that rely upon
      signaling along the media path to operate effectively.

  "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Extension For Setting Audio and
  Video Media Streams Over Circuit-Switched Bearers In The Public Switched
  Telephone Network (PSTN)", Miguel Garcia, Simo Veikkolainen, 2013-06-26,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-cs-21.txt>

      This memo describes use cases, requirements, and protocol extensions
      for using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer model
      for establishing audio and video media streams over circuit-switched
      bearers in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).

  "Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)-Based Media Transport in
  the Session Description Protocol (SDP)", Salvatore Loreto, Gonzalo
  Camarillo, 2013-06-30, <draft-ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp-04.txt>

      SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) is a transport protocol
      used to establish associations between two endpoints.  This document
      describes how to express media transport over SCTP in SDP (Session
      Description Protocol).  This document defines the 'SCTP', 'SCTP/DTLS'
      and 'DTLS/SCTP' protocol identifiers for SDP.

  "The Session Description Protocol (SDP) 'trafficclass' Attribute", James
  Polk, Subha Dhesikan, Paul Jones, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-traffic-class-for-sdp-04.txt>

      This document proposes a new Session Description Protocol (SDP)
      attribute to identify the traffic class a session is requesting
      in its offer/answer exchange.

  "Multiplexing Negotiation Using Session Description Protocol (SDP) Port
  Numbers", Christer Holmberg, Harald Alvestrand, Cullen Jennings,
  2013-06-14, <draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation-04.txt>

      This specification defines a new SDP Grouping Framework extension,
      "BUNDLE", that can be used with the Session Description Protocol
      (SDP) Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of bundled media,
      which refers to the usage of a single 5-tuple for media associated
      with multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" lines).

  "Miscellaneous Capabilities Negotiation in the Session Description
  Protocol (SDP)", Miguel Garcia, Simo Veikkolainen, Robert Gilman,
  2013-07-10, <draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-miscellaneous-caps-07.txt>

      SDP has been extended with a capability negotiation mechanism
      framework that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport protocols
      and attributes.  This framework has been extended with a media
      capabilities negotiation mechanism that allows endpoints to negotiate
      additional media-related capabilities.  This negotiation is embedded
      into the widely-used SDP offer/answer procedures.
      
      This memo extends the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow
      endpoints to negotiate three additional SDP capabilities.  In
      particular, this memo provides a mechanism to negotiate bandwidth
      ('b=' line), connection data ('c=' line), and session or media titles
      ('i=' line for each session or media).

  "Duplication Grouping Semantics in the Session Description Protocol",
  Ali Begen, Yiqun Cai, Heidi Ou, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-duplication-grouping-03.txt>

      Packet loss is undesirable for real-time multimedia sessions, but can
      occur due to congestion, or other unplanned network outages.  This is
      especially true for IP multicast networks, where packet loss patterns
      can vary greatly between receivers.  One technique that can be used
      to recover from packet loss without incurring unbounded delay for all
      the receivers is to duplicate the packets and send them in separate
      redundant streams.  This document defines the semantics for grouping
      redundant streams in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  The
      semantics defined in this document are to be used with the SDP
      Grouping Framework.  SSRC-level (Synchronization Source) grouping
      semantics are also defined in this document for RTP streams using
      SSRC multiplexing.

  "Delayed Duplication Attribute in the Session Description Protocol", Ali
  Begen, Yiqun Cai, Heidi Ou, 2013-05-27,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-delayed-duplication-02.txt>

      A straightforward approach to provide protection against packet
      losses due to network outages with a longest duration of T time units
      is to simply duplicate the original packets and send each copy
      separated in time by at least T time units.  This approach is
      commonly referred to as Time-shifted Redundancy, Temporal Redundancy
      or simply Delayed Duplication.  This document defines an attribute to
      indicate the presence of temporally redundant media streams and the
      duplication delay in the Session Description Protocol.

  "Latching: Hosted NAT Traversal (HNT) for Media in Real-Time
  Communication", Emil Ivov, Hadriel Kaplan, Dan Wing, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-latching-03.txt>

      This document describes behavior of signalling intermediaries in
      Real-Time Communication (RTC) deployments, sometimes referred to as
      Session Border Controllers (SBCs), when performing Hosted NAT
      Traversal (HNT).  HNT is a set of mechanisms, such as media relaying
      and latching, that such intermediaries use to enable other RTC
      devices behind NATs to communicate with each other.  This document is
      non-normative, and is only written to explain HNT in order to provide
      a reference to the IETF community, as well as an informative
      description to manufacturers, and users.

  "Offer/Answer Considerations for G723 Annex A and G729 Annex B", Muthu
  Perumal, Parthasarathi Ravindran, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-g723-g729-04.txt>

      RFC4856 describes the annexa parameter for G723 and the annexb
      parameter for G729, G729D and G729E. However, the specification does
      not describe the offerer and answerer behavior when the value of the
      annexa or annexb parameter does not match in the Session Description
      protocol(SDP) offer and answer.  This document provides the offer/
      answer considerations for these parameters and updates RFC4856.

  "Cross Session Stream Identification in the Session Description
  Protocol", Harald Alvestrand, 2013-02-10,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-msid-00.txt>

      This document specifies a grouping mechanism for RTP media streams
      that can be used to specify relations between media streams within
      different RTP sessions as well as within a single RTP session, and
      independently of whether these media streams are described within one
      SDP m-line or in multiple m-lines.
      
      This mechanism is used to signal the association between the RTP
      concept of SSRC and the WebRTC concept of "MediaStream" /
      "MediaStreamTrack" using SDP signaling.
      
      This document is a work item of the MMUSIC WG, whose discussion list
      is mmusic@ietf.org.

  (SIP)", Marc Petit-Huguenin, Ari Keranen, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-sip-sdp-00.txt>

      This document describes how Interactive Connectivity Establishment
      (ICE) is used with Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer
      and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

  "Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network
  Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols", Ari
  Keranen, Jonathan Rosenberg, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-rfc5245bis-00.txt>

      This document describes a protocol for Network Address Translator
      (NAT) traversal for UDP-based multimedia sessions established with
      the offer/answer model.  This protocol is called Interactive
      Connectivity Establishment (ICE).  ICE makes use of the Session
      Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol and its extension,
      Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN).  ICE can be used by any protocol
      utilizing the offer/answer model, such as the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP).
      
      This document obsoletes RFC 5245.

Multiprotocol Label Switching (mpls)
------------------------------------

  "A Thesaurus for the Terminology used in Multiprotocol Label Switching
  Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) drafts/RFCs and ITU-T's Transport Network
  Recommendations.", Huub van Helvoort, Loa Andersson, Nurit Sprecher,
  2013-07-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-rosetta-stone-11.txt>

      MPLS-TP is based on a profile of the MPLS and PW procedures as
      specified in the MPLS-TE and (MS-)PW architectures developed by the
      IETF.  The ITU-T has specified a Transport Network architecture.
      
      This document provides a thesaurus for the interpretation of MPLS-TP
      terminology within the context of the ITU-T Transport Network
      recommendations.
      
      It is important to note that MPLS-TP is applicable in a wider set of
      contexts than just Transport Networks.  The definitions presented in
      this document do not provide exclusive nor complete interpretations
      of MPLS-TP concepts.  This document simply allows the MPLS-TP terms
      to be applied within the Transport Network context.

  "Return Path Specified LSP Ping", Mach Chen, Wei Cao, So Ning, Frederic
  JOUNAY, Simon DeLord, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-return-path-specified-lsp-ping-12.txt>

      This document defines extensions to the failure-detection protocol
      for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
      known as "LSP Ping" that allow selection of the LSP to use for the
      echo reply return path.  Enforcing a specific return path can be used
      to verify bidirectional connectivity and also increase LSP ping
      robustness.  It may also be used by Bidirectional Forwarding
      Detection (BFD) for MPLS bootstrap signaling thereby making BFD for
      MPLS more robust.

  Carlos Pignataro, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-ipv6-09.txt>

      The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) specification defines
      procedures to exchange label bindings over either IPv4, or IPv6 or
      both networks. This document corrects and clarifies the LDP behavior
      when IPv6 network is used (with or without IPv4). This document
      updates RFC 5036.

  Filsfils, Maciek Konstantynowicz, Dirk Steinberg, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls-04.txt>

      This documents describes an architecture which can be used to extend
      MPLS networks to integrate access and aggregation networks into a
      single MPLS domain ("Seamless MPLS").  The Seamless MPLS approach is
      based on existing and well known protocols.  It provides a highly
      flexible and a scalable architecture and the possibility to integrate
      100.000 of nodes.  The separation of the service and transport plane
      is one of the key elements; Seamless MPLS provides end to end service
      independent transport.  Therefore it removes the need for service
      specific configurations in network transport nodes (without end to
      end transport MPLS, some additional services nodes/configurations
      would be required to glue each transport domain).  This draft defines
      a routing architecture using existing standardized protocols.  It
      does not invent any new protocols or defines extensions to existing
      protocols.

  "Inter-Area P2MP Segmented LSPs", Yakov Rekhter, Rahul Aggarwal,
  2013-05-14, <draft-ietf-mpls-seamless-mcast-07.txt>

      This document describes procedures for building inter-area point-to-
      multipoint (P2MP) segmented service LSPs by partitioning such LSPs
      into intra-area segments and using BGP as the inter-area routing and
      label distribution protocol. Within each IGP area the intra-area
      segments are either carried over intra-area P2MP LSPs, using P2MP LSP
      hierarchy, or instantiated using ingress replication.  The intra-area
      P2MP LSPs may be signaled using P2MP RSVP-TE or P2MP mLDP. If ingress
      replication is used within an IGP area, then MP2P LDP LSPs or P2P
      RSVP-TE LSPs may be used in the IGP area. The applications/services
      that use such inter-area service LSPs may be BGP MVPN, VPLS
      multicast, or global table multicast over MPLS.

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
      In particular, it describes managed objects of Tunnels, Identifiers,
      Label Switch Router and Textual conventions for Multiprotocol Label

  "Disabling IPoMPLS and P2P PW LDP Application's State Advertisement",
  Kamran Raza, Sami Boutros, 2013-06-20,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-ip-pw-capability-06.txt>

      Currently, no LDP capability is exchanged for LDP applications like
      IP Label Switching and L2VPN P2P PW signaling. When an LDP session
      comes up, an LDP speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state
      for such LDP applications even when the peer session is established
      for some other applications like mLDP or ICCP. This document defines
      a solution by which an LDP speaker announces to its peer its
      disinterest in such non-negotiated applications. This, in turn,
      disables the advertisement of corresponding application state, which
      would have otherwise be advertised by default, over the established
      LDP session.

  "Definition of Time-to-Live TLV for LSP-Ping Mechanisms", Sami Boutros,
  Siva Sivabalan, George Swallow, Shaleen Saxena, Vishwas Manral, Sam
  Aldrin, 2013-04-20, <draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-ttl-tlv-05.txt>

      LSP-Ping is a widely deployed Operation, Administration, and
      Maintenance (OAM) mechanism in MPLS networks. However, in the present
      form, this mechanism is inadequate to verify connectivity of a
      segment of a Multi-Segment PseudoWire (MS-PW) from any node on the
      path of the MS-PW. This document defines a TLV to address this
      shortcoming.

  "LDP Extensions for Multi Topology Routing", Quintin Zhao, Luyuan Fang,
  Chao Zhou, Lianyuan Li, Kamran Raza, 2013-05-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology-08.txt>

      Multi-Topology (MT) routing is supported in IP networks with the use
      of MT aware IGP protocols.  In order to provide MT routing within
      Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Distribution Protocol
      (LDP) networks new extensions are required.  This document updates
      RFC4379.
      
      This document describes the LDP protocol extensions required to
      support MT routing in an MPLS environment.

  "Performance-based Path Selection for Explicitly Routed LSPs using TE
  Metric Extensions", Alia Atlas, John Drake, Spencer Giacalone, David
  Ward, Stefano Previdi, Clarence Filsfils, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-atlas-mpls-te-express-path-03.txt>

      In certain networks, it is critical to consider network performance
      criteria when selecting the path for an explicitly routed RSVP-TE
      LSP.  Such performance criteria can include latency, jitter, and loss
      or other indications such as the conformance to link performance
      objectives and non-RSVP TE traffic load.  This specification uses
      network performance data, such as is advertised via the OSPF and ISIS
      TE metric extensions (defined outside the scope of this document) to
      perform such path selections.

  "P2MP Based mLDP Node Protection Mechanisms for mLDP LSP", Quintin Zhao,

  Adrian Farrel, Hideki Endo, Rolf Winter, Yoshinori Koike, Manuel Paul,
  2013-07-31, <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mip-mep-map-08.txt>

      The Framework for Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)
      within the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) describes how Maintenance
      Entity Group Intermediate Points (MIPs) may be situated within
      network nodes at the incoming and outgoing interfaces.
      
      This document elaborates on important considerations for internal MIP
      addressing.  More precisely it describes important restrictions for
      any mechanism that specifies a way of forming OAM messages so that
      they can be targeted at MIPs on incoming or MIPs on outgoing
      interfaces and forwarded correctly through the forwarding engine.
      Furthermore, the document includes considerations for node
      implementations where there is no distinction between the incoming
      and outgoing MIP.

  "LDP Downstream-on-Demand in Seamless MPLS", Thomas Beckhaus, Bruno
  Decraene, Kishore Tiruveedhula, Maciek Konstantynowicz, Luca Martini,
  2013-07-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-dod-09.txt>

      Seamless MPLS design enables a single IP/MPLS network to scale over
      core, metro and access parts of a large packet network infrastructure
      using standardized IP/MPLS protocols.  One of the key goals of
      Seamless MPLS is to meet requirements specific to access, including
      high number of devices, their position in network topology and their
      compute and memory constraints that limit the amount of state access
      devices can hold.This can be achieved with LDP Downstream-on-Demand
      (LDP DoD) label advertisement.  This document describes LDP DoD use
      cases and lists required LDP DoD procedures in the context of
      Seamless MPLS design.
      
      In addition, a new optional TLV type in the LDP Label Request message
      is defined for fast-up convergence.

  <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing-08.txt>

      The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
      is the set of MPLS protocol functions applicable to the construction
      and operation of packet-switched transport networks.  This document
      presents considerations for link-layer addressing of Ethernet frames
      carrying MPLS-TP packets.

  "MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) Advertisement Protocol", Dan
  Frost, Stewart Bryant, Matthew Bocci, 2013-06-07,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-gach-adv-08.txt>

      The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) provides an auxiliary
      logical data channel associated with a Label Switched Path (LSP), a
      pseudowire, or a section (link) over which a variety of protocols may
      flow.  These protocols are commonly used to provide Operations,
      Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms associated with the
      primary data channel.  This document specifies simple procedures by
      which an endpoint of an LSP, pseudowire, or section may inform the
      other endpoints of its capabilities and configuration parameters, or
      other application-specific information.  This information may then be
      used by the receiver to validate or adjust its local configuration,
      and by the network operator for diagnostic purposes.

  "mLDP Node Protection", IJsbrand Wijnands, Eric Rosen, Kamran Raza, Jeff
  Tantsura, Alia Atlas, Quintin Zhao, 2013-06-23,
  <draft-wijnands-mpls-mldp-node-protection-04.txt>

      This document describes procedures to support node protection for
      Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths
      (MP LSPs) built by LDP ("Label Distribution Protocol"), or simply
      mLDP.  In order to protect a node N, the Point of Local Repair (PLR)
      LSR of N must learn the Merge Point (MPT) LSR(s) of node N such that
      traffic can be redirected to them in case node N fails.  Redirecting
      the traffic around the failed node N depends on existing P2P LSPs
      originated from the PLR LSR to the MPT LSRs while bypassing LSR node
      N.

  "Temporal and hitless path segment monitoring", Alessandro D'Alessandro,
  Manuel Paul, Satoshi Ueno, Yoshinori Koike, 2013-05-07,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-temporal-hitless-psm-03.txt>

      The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized to enable
      carrier-grade packet transport and complement converged packet
      network deployments. Among the most attractive features of MPLS-TP
      are OAM functions, which enable network operators or service
      providers to provide various maintenance characteristics, such as
      fault location, survivability, performance monitoring, and
      preliminary or in-service measurements.
      
      One of the most important mechanisms which is common for transport
      network operation is fault location. A segment monitoring function of
      a transport path is effective in terms of extension of the
      maintenance work and indispensable particularly when the OAM function
      is effective only between end points. However, the current approach
      defined for MPLS-TP for the segment monitoring (SPME) has some fatal
      drawbacks. This document elaborates on the problem statement for the
      Sub-path Maintenance Elements (SPMEs) which provides monitoring of a
      portion of a set of transport paths (LSPs or MS-PWs). Based on the
      problems, this document specifies new requirements to consider a new
      improved mechanism of hitless transport path segment monitoring.
      
      This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
      Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
      Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
      capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

  Kannan Sampath, Thomas Nadeau, 2013-06-18,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-id-mib-03.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
      In particular, it describes Operations, Administration, and
      Management (OAM) identifiers related managed objects for

  "Using LDP Multipoint Extensions on Targeted LDP Sessions", Maria
  Napierala, Eric Rosen, 2013-08-05,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-targeted-mldp-03.txt>

      As specified in RFC 6388, Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be
      used to set up Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-
      Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths.  However, RFC 6388
      presupposes that the two endpoints of an LDP session are directly
      connected.  The LDP base specification (RFC 5036) allows for the case
      where the two endpoints of an LDP session are not directly connected;
      such a session is known as a "Targeted LDP" session.  This document
      provides the specification for using the LDP P2MP/MP2MP extensions
      over a Targeted LDP session.

  "MPLS-TP 1toN Protection", Eric Osborne, Fei Zhang, Yaacov Weingarten,
  2013-08-06, <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1ton-protection-02.txt>

      There is a requirement for Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport
      Profile(MPLS-TP) to support 1:n linear protection for transport
      paths.  This requirement is further elaborated in RFC6372
      [SurvivFwk].  The basic protocol for linear protection, specified in
      RFC6378 [LinProt], is limited to 1+1 and 1:1 protection.  This
      document extends that protocol to address the additional
      functionality necessary to support scenarios where a single
      protection path is preconfigured to provide protection of multiple
      transport paths between two joint endpoints.
      
      This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
      Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
      Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
      capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
      defined by the ITU-T.

  "Applicability of LDP Label Advertisement Mode", Kamran Raza, Sami
  Boutros, Luca Martini, Nicolai Leymann, 2013-02-14,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-applicability-label-adv-01.txt>

      An LDP speaker negotiates the label advertisement mode with its LDP
      peer at the time of session establishment. Although different
      applications sharing the same LDP session may need different modes
      of label distribution and advertisement, there is only one type of
      label advertisement mode that is negotiated and used per LDP
      session. This document clarifies the use and the applicability of
      session's negotiated label advertisement mode, and categorizes LDP
      applications into two broad categories of negotiated mode-bound and
      mode-independent applications. The document updates RFC5036 and
      RFC4447 to remove any ambiguity and conflict in the area of using
      correct label advertisement mode for a given application.

  "LDP Extensions for Hub & Spoke Multipoint Label Switched Path", Lizhong
  Jin, Frederic JOUNAY, IJsbrand Wijnands, Nicolai Leymann, 2013-04-19,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-mldp-hsmp-01.txt>

      This draft introduces a hub & spoke multipoint LSP (short for HSMP
      LSP), which allows traffic both from root to leaf through P2MP LSP
      and also leaf to root along the co-routed reverse path.  That means
      traffic entering the HSMP LSP from application/customer at the root
      node travels downstream, exactly as if it was traveling downstream
      along a P2MP LSP to each leaf node, and traffic entering the HSMP LSP
      at any leaf node travels upstream along the tree to the root as if it
      is unicast to the root, except that it follows the path of the tree
      rather than ordinary unicast to the root.

  "Signaling RSVP-TE P2MP LSPs in an Inter-domain Environment", Zafar Ali,
  Rakesh Gandhi, Cisco Systems, Robert Venator, Yuji Kamite, 2013-04-12,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-inter-domain-p2mp-rsvp-te-lsp-01.txt>

      Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
      Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
      LSPs) are established using signaling procedures defined in
      [RFC4875]. However, [RFC4875] does not address several issues that
      arise when a P2MP-TE LSP is signaled in inter-domain networks. One
      such issue is the computation of a loosely routed inter-domain P2MP-
      TE LSP paths that are re-merge free. Another issue is the
      reoptimization of the inter-domain P2MP-TE LSP tree vs. an individual
      destination(s), since the loosely routing domain ingress border node
      is not aware of the reoptimization scope. This document defines the
      required protocol extensions needed for establishing and reoptimizing
      P2MP MPLS and GMPLS TE LSPs in inter-domain networks.

  "Encapsulating MPLS in UDP", KuiKe Building, Nischal Sheth, Lucy Yong,
  Carlos Pignataro, Fan Yongbing, 2013-06-08,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-in-udp-02.txt>

      Existing technologies to encapsulate Multi-Protocol Label Switching
      (MPLS) over IP are not adequate for efficient load balancing of MPLS
      application traffic, such as MPLS-based Layer2 Virtual Private
      Network (L2VPN) or Layer3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN) traffic
      across IP networks. This document specifies additional IP-based
      encapsulation technology, referred to as MPLS-in-User Datagram
      Protocol (UDP), which can facilitate the load balancing of MPLS
      application traffic across IP networks.

  "A Framework for Point-to-Multipoint MPLS in Transport Networks", Dan
  Frost, Stewart Bryant, Matthew Bocci, Lou Berger, 2013-04-08,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-p2mp-framework-01.txt>

      The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
      is the common set of MPLS protocol functions defined to enable the
      construction and operation of packet transport networks.  The MPLS-TP
      supports both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint transport paths.
      This document defines the elements and functions of the MPLS-TP
      architecture applicable specifically to supporting point-to-
      multipoint transport paths.
      
      This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
      use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines objects
      for managing MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection.

  ""MPLS LSP Ping TLVs and sub-TLVs registry"", Loa Andersson, Mach Chen,
  Tom Petch, 2013-05-01,
  <draft-pac-mpls-lsp-ping-tlvs-and-sub-tlvs-registry-02.txt>

      This document addresses issues with the structure, allocation
      policies and clarity in the use of the "TLVs and sub-TLVs" of the
      "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
      Ping Parameters" in the "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture
      (MPLS)" name space.
      
      This document does not change any existing allocations and the new
      structure is backwards compatible with the existing registries.
      
      The policy for the allocation of TLVs is unchanged but future
      allocations of sub-TLVs will come from a single namespace, common to
      all TLVs of LSP Ping Parameters.

  "Use of Multipath with MPLS-TP and MPLS", Curtis Villamizar, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-multipath-use-00.txt>

      Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques and
      many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in
      very high bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core
      networks.  MPLS-TP has strongly discouraged the use of multipath
      techniques.  Some degradation of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot be
      avoided when operating over many types of multipath implementations.
      
      Using MPLS Entropy label, MPLS LSPs can be carried over multipath
      links while also providing a fully MPLS-TP compliant server layer for
      MPLS-TP LSPs.  This document describes the means of supporting MPLS
      as a server layer for MPLS-TP.  The use of MPLS-TP LSPs as a server
      layer for MPLS LSPs is also discussed.

  "Relayed Echo Reply mechanism for LSP Ping", Luo Jian, Lizhong Jin,
  Thomas Nadeau, George Swallow, 2013-08-05,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-relay-reply-01.txt>

      In some inter-AS and inter-area deployment scenarios for LSP Ping and
      Traceroute, a replying LSR may not have the available route to the
      initiator, and the Echo Reply message sent to the initiator would be
      discarded resulting in false negatives or complete failure of
      operation of LSP Ping and Traceroute.  This document describes
      extensions to LSP Ping mechanism to enable the replying LSR to have
      the capability to relay the echo response by a set of routable
      intermediate nodes to the initiator during the traceroute process in
      inter-AS and inter-area scenarios.

  "Requirements for MPLS Shared Mesh Protection", Yaacov Weingarten, Sam
  Aldrin, Ping Pan, Jeong-dong Ryoo, Greg Mirsky, 2013-03-26,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-smp-requirements-00.txt>

      This document presents the basic network objectives for the behavior
      of shared mesh protection (SMP) not based on control-plane support.
      This is an expansion of the basic requirements presented in the MPLS
      Transport Profile Requirements (RFC5654) and MPLS Transport Profile
      Survivability Framework (RFC6372) documents.  This document should be
      used as a basis for the definition of the mechanism that would be
      used to implement SMP for MPLS-TP data paths, in networks that do not
      employ a control plane for their operation.

  "MPLS Forwarding Compliance and Performance Requirements", Curtis
  Villamizar, Kireeti Kompella, Shane Amante, Andrew Malis, Carlos
  Pignataro, 2013-04-16, <draft-ietf-mpls-forwarding-00.txt>

      This document provides guidelines for implementors regarding MPLS
      forwarding and a basis for evaluations of forwarding implementations.
      Guidelines cover many aspects of MPLS forwarding.  Topics are
      highlighted where implementors might potentially overlook practical
      requirements which are unstated or underemphasized or are optional
      for conformance to RFCs.

  "Retiring TLVs from the Associated Channel Header of the MPLS Generic
  Associated Channel", Adrian Farrel, Stewart Bryant, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-retire-ach-tlv-03.txt>

      The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) is a generalization of
      the applicability of the Pseudowire (PW) Associated Channel Header
      (ACH).  RFC 5586 defines the concept of TLV constructs that can be
      carried in messages on the G-ACh by placing them in the ACH between
      the fixed header fields and the G-ACh message.  These TLVs are called
      ACH TLVs
      
      No Associated Channel Type yet defined uses an ACH TLV.  Furthermore,
      it is believed that handling TLVs in hardware introduces significant
      problems to the fast-path, and since G-ACh messages are intended to
      be processed substantially in hardware, the use of ACH TLVs is
      undesirable.
      
      This document updates RFC 5586 by retiring ACH TLVs and removing the
      associated registry.

  "Hub and Spoke Multipoint Label Switched Path Tunnels", Lizhong Jin,
  Frederic JOUNAY, Manav Bhatia, Sriganesh Kini, 2013-06-03,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-rsvp-te-hsmp-lsp-00.txt>

      There are applications that require bi-directional, co-routed and
      guaranteed communication from a root node to several leaf nodes in a
      hub and spoke fashion.  To meet such application requirements in a
      Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network this draft defines a
      Hub and Spoke Multipoint Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (HSMP
      TE LSP) with resource reservations for guaranteed communication.
      This draft also defines a protocol to setup such LSPs by re-using and
      extending P2MP RSVP-TE.

  "Allocating and Retiring Special Purpose MPLS Labels", Kireeti Kompella,
  Loa Andersson, Adrian Farrel, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-special-purpose-labels-03.txt>

      Some MPLS labels have been allocated for specific purposes.  A block
      of labels (0-15) has been set aside to this end, and are commonly
      called "reserved labels".  They will be called "special purpose
      labels" in this document.  As there are only 16 of these labels,
      caution is needed in the allocation of new special purpose labels,
      yet at the same time allow forward progress when one is called for.
      This memo defines some procedures to follow in the allocation and
      retirement of special purpose labels, as well as a method to extend
      the special purpose label space.  Finally, this memo renames the IANA
      registry for these labels to "Special Purpose MPLS Label Values", and
      creates a new one called the "Extended Special Purpose MPLS Label
      Values" registry.

  "Proxy MPLS Echo Request", George Swallow, Vanson Lim, Sam Aldrin,
  2013-07-05, <draft-ietf-mpls-proxy-lsp-ping-00.txt>

      This document defines a means of remotely initiating Multiprotocol
      Label Switched Protocol Pings on Label Switched Paths.  A proxy ping
      request is sent to any Label Switching Routers along a Label Switched
      Path.  The primary motivations for this facility are first to limit
      the number of messages and related processing when using LSP Ping in
      large Point-to-Multipoint LSPs, and second to enable leaf to leaf/
      root tracing.

  "mLDP Node Protection", IJsbrand Wijnands, Eric Rosen, Kamran Raza, Jeff
  Tantsura, Alia Atlas, Quintin Zhao, 2013-08-06,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-mldp-node-protection-00.txt>

      This document describes procedures to support node protection for
      Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths
      (MP LSPs) built by LDP ("Label Distribution Protocol"), or simply
      mLDP.  In order to protect a node N, the Point of Local Repair (PLR)
      LSR of N must learn the Merge Point (MPT) LSR(s) of node N such that
      traffic can be redirected to them in case node N fails.  Redirecting
      the traffic around the failed node N depends on existing P2P LSPs
      originated from the PLR LSR to the MPT LSRs while bypassing LSR node
      N.

Multicast Mobility (multimob)
-----------------------------

  "Mobile Multicast Sender Support in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) Domains",
  Thomas Schmidt, Shuai Gao, Hong-Ke Zhang, Matthias Waehlisch,
  2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-multimob-pmipv6-source-04.txt>

      Multicast communication can be enabled in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains
      via the Local Mobility Anchors by deploying MLD Proxy functions at
      Mobile Access Gateways, via a direct traffic distribution within an
      ISP's access network, or by selective route optimization schemes.
      This document describes the support of mobile multicast senders in
      Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains for all three scenarios.  Protocol
      optimizations for synchronizing PMIPv6 with PIM, as well as a peering
      function for MLD Proxies defined.  Mobile sources always remain
      agnostic of multicast mobility operations.

  "Multicast Mobility Routing Optimizations for Proxy Mobile IPv6", Juan
  Zuniga, Luis Contreras, Carlos Bernardos, Seil Jeon, Younghan Kim,
  2013-07-03, <draft-ietf-multimob-pmipv6-ropt-07.txt>

      A base solution to support IP multicasting in a PMIPv6 domain is
      specified in [RFC6224].  In this document, some enhancements to the
      base solution are described.  These enhancements include the use of a
      multicast tree mobility anchor as the topological anchor point for
      multicast traffic, as well as a direct routing option where the MAG
      can provide access to multicast content in the local network.  These
      enhancements provide benefits such as reducing multicast traffic
      replication and supporting different PMIPv6 deployment scenarios.

  "PMIPv6 multicast handover optimization by the Subscription Information
  Acquisition through the LMA (SIAL)", Luis Contreras, Carlos Bernardos,
  Ignacio Soto, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-ietf-multimob-handover-optimization-03.txt>

      This document specifies a multicast handover optimization mechanism
      for Proxy Mobile IPv6 to accelerate the delivery of multicast traffic
      to mobile nodes after handovers.  The mechanism is based on speeding
      up the acquisition of mobile nodes' multicast context by the mobile
      access gateways.  To do that, extensions to the current Proxy Mobile
      IPv6 protocol are proposed.  These extensions are not only applicable
      to the base solution for multicast support in Proxy Mobile IPv6, but
      they can also be applied to other solutions developed to avoid the
      tunnel convergence problem.  Furthermore, the extensions are also
      independent of the role played by the mobile access gateway within
      the multicast network (either acting as multicast listener discovery
      proxy or multicast router).

  "Multicast Listener Extensions for MIPv6 and PMIPv6 Fast Handovers",
  Thomas Schmidt, Matthias Waehlisch, Rajeev Koodli, Gorry Fairhurst,
  Dapeng Liu, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-multimob-fmipv6-pfmipv6-multicast-01.txt>

      Fast handover protocols for MIPv6 and PMIPv6 define mobility
      management procedures that support unicast communication at reduced
      handover latency.  Fast handover base operations do not affect
      multicast communication, and hence do not accelerate handover
      management for native multicast listeners.  Many multicast
      applications like IPTV or conferencing, though, are comprised of
      delay-sensitive real-time traffic and will benefit from fast handover
      execution.  This document specifies extension of the Mobile IPv6 Fast
      Handovers (FMIPv6) and the Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6
      (PFMIPv6) protocols to include multicast traffic management in fast
      handover operations.  This multicast support is provided first at the
      control plane by a management of rapid context transfer between
      access routers, second at the data plane by an optional fast traffic
      forwarding that may include buffering.

  "PT-EAP: Posture Transport (PT) Protocol For EAP Tunnel Methods", Nancy
  Cam-Winget, Paul Sangster, 2013-03-28, <draft-ietf-nea-pt-eap-09.txt>

      This document specifies PT-EAP, an Extensible Authentication Protocol
      (EAP) based Posture Transport (PT) protocol designed to be used only
      inside a TLS protected EAP tunnel method.  The document also
      describes the intended applicability of PT-EAP.

  Mohamad Badra, Alan Luchuk, Jürgen Schönwälder, 2013-05-10,
  <draft-ietf-netconf-rfc5539bis-03.txt>

      The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to
      install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices.
      This document describes how to use the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
      protocol to secure the exchange of NETCONF messages.  This document
      obsoletes RFC 5539.

  "Reverse Secure Shell (Reverse SSH)", Kent Watsen, 2013-06-21,
  <draft-ietf-netconf-reverse-ssh-01.txt>

      This memo presents a technique for a NETCONF server to initiate a SSH
      connection to a NETCONF client.  This is accomplished by the NETCONF
      client listening on IANA-assigned TCP port YYYY and starting the SSH
      client protocol immediately after accepting a TCP connection on it.
      This role-reversal is necessary as the NETCONF server must also be
      the SSH Server, in order for the NETCONF client to open the IANA-
      assigned SSH subsystem "netconf".

Network-Based Mobility Extensions (netext)
------------------------------------------

  "Logical Interface Support for multi-mode IP Hosts", Telemaco Melia, Sri
  Gundavelli, 2013-04-24,
  <draft-ietf-netext-logical-interface-support-07.txt>

      A Logical Interface is a software semantic internal to the host
      operating system.  This semantic is available in all popular
      operating systems and is used in various protocol implementations.
      The Logical Interface support is required on the mobile node
      operating in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, for leveraging various
      network-based mobility management features such as inter-technology
      handoffs, multihoming and flow mobility support.  This document
      explains the operational details of Logical Interface construct and
      the specifics on how the link-layer implementations hide the physical
      interfaces from the IP stack and from the network nodes on the
      attached access networks.  Furthermore, this document identifies the
      applicability of this approach to various link-layer technologies and
      analyzes the issues around it when used in context with various
      mobility management features.

  "Prefix Delegation Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6", Xingyue Zhou, Jouni
  Korhonen, Carl Williams, Sri Gundavelli, Carlos Bernardos, 2013-06-18,
  <draft-ietf-netext-pd-pmip-09.txt>

      This specification defines extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol
      for allowing a mobile router in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to obtain
      delegated IP prefixes for its attached mobile networks.  The mobility
      entities in the network will provide network-based mobility
      management support for those delegated IP prefixes just as how IP
      mobility support is provided for the mobile node's home address.
      Even as the mobile router performs a handoff and changes its network
      point of attachment, mobility support is ensured for all the
      delegated IP prefixes and for all the IP nodes in the mobile network
      that use IP address configuration from those delegated IP prefixes.

  "Proxy Mobile IPv6 Extensions to Support Flow Mobility", Carlos
  Bernardos, 2013-02-25, <draft-ietf-netext-pmipv6-flowmob-06.txt>

      Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node to connect to the same Proxy
      Mobile IPv6 domain through different interfaces.  However, the
      ability of movement of selected flows from one access technology to
      another is missing in the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol.  This
      document describes extensions to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol that
      are required to support network based flow mobility over multiple
      physical interfaces.
      
      The extensions required consist on the operations performed by the
      local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway to manage the
      prefixes assigned to the different interfaces of the mobile node, as
      well as how the forwarding policies are handled by the network to
      ensure consistent flow mobility management.

  "EAP Attributes for WiFi - EPC Integration", Ravi Valmikam, Rajeev
  Koodli, 2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-netext-wifi-epc-eap-attributes-03.txt>

      With WiFi beginning to establishing itself as a trusted access
      network for service providers, it has become important to provide
      functions commonly available in 3G and 4G networks in WiFi access
      networks.  Such functions include Access Point Name (APN) Selection,
      multiple Packet Data Network (PDN) connections and seamless mobility
      between WiFi and 3G/4G networks.
      
      EAP/AKA (and EAP/AKA') is standardized by 3GPP as the access
      authentication protocol for trusted access networks.  This IETF
      specification is required for mobile devices to access the 3GPP
      Evolved Packet Core (EPC) networks.  This document defines a few new
      EAP attributes and procedures to provide the above-mentioned
      functions in trusted WiFi access networks.

  "Quality of Service Option for Proxy Mobile IPv6", Marco Liebsch,
  Pierrick Seite, Hidetoshi Yokota, Jouni Korhonen, Sri Gundavelli,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-netext-pmip6-qos-03.txt>

      This specification defines a new mobility option that can be used by
      the mobility entities in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to exchange
      Quality of Service parameters associated with a subscriber's IP
      flows.  Using the QoS option, the local mobility anchor and the
      mobile access gateway can exchange available QoS attributes and
      associated values.  This enables QoS policing and labeling of packets
      to enforce QoS differentiation on the path between the local mobility
      anchor and the mobile access gateway.  Furthermore, making QoS
      parameters available on the MAG enables mapping these parameters to
      QoS rules being specific to the access technology which operates
      below the mobile access gateway.  After such mapping, QoS rules can
      be enforced on the access technology components, such as an IEEE
      802.11e Wireless LAN controller.

  "Update Notifications for Proxy Mobile IPv6", Suresh Krishnan, Sri
  Gundavelli, Marco Liebsch, Hidetoshi Yokota, Jouni Korhonen, 2013-06-17,
  <draft-ietf-netext-update-notifications-05.txt>

      This document specifies protocol enhancements for allowing the local
      mobility anchor in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to asynchronously
      notify the mobile access gateway about changes related to a mobility
      session.  These update notification messages are exchanged using a
      new Mobility Header message type specifically designed for this
      purpose.

NETCONF Data Modeling Language (netmod)

  "A YANG Data Model for Routing Management", Ladislav Lhotka, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-ietf-netmod-routing-cfg-10.txt>

      This document contains a specification of three YANG modules.
      Together they form the core routing data model which serves as a
      framework for configuring and managing a routing subsystem.  It is
      expected that these modules will be augmented by additional YANG
      modules defining data models for individual routing protocols and
      other related functions.  The core routing data model provides common
      building blocks for such extensions - router instances, routes,
      routing tables, routing protocols and route filters.

  Renu Tewari, Chuck Lever, 2012-12-12,
  <draft-ietf-nfsv4-federated-fs-protocol-15.txt>

      This document describes a filesystem federation protocol that enables
      file access and namespace traversal across collections of
      independently administered fileservers.  The protocol specifies a set
      of interfaces by which fileservers with different administrators can
      form a fileserver federation that provides a namespace composed of
      the filesystems physically hosted on and exported by the constituent
      fileservers.

      namespace composed of the filesystems physically hosted on and
      exported by the constituent fileservers.

  "Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Protocol", Tom, David Noveck,
  2013-05-08, <draft-ietf-nfsv4-rfc3530bis-26.txt>

      The Network File System (NFS) version 4 is a distributed filesystem
      protocol which owes heritage to NFS protocol version 2, RFC 1094, and
      version 3, RFC 1813.  Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4
      protocol supports traditional file access while integrating support
      for file locking and the mount protocol.  In addition, support for
      strong security (and its negotiation), compound operations, client
      caching, and internationalization have been added.  Of course,
      attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an
      Internet environment.
      
      This document, together with the companion XDR description document,
      RFCNFSv4XDR, obsoletes RFC 3530 as the definition of the NFS version
      4 protocol.

  "Network File System (NFS) Version 4 External Data Representation

  <draft-ietf-nfsv4-minorversion2-19.txt>

      This Internet-Draft describes NFS version 4 minor version two,
      focusing mainly on the protocol extensions made from NFS version 4
      minor version 0 and NFS version 4 minor version 1.  Major extensions
      introduced in NFS version 4 minor version two include: Server-side
      Copy, Application I/O Advise, Space Reservations, Sparse Files,
      Application Data Blocks, and Labeled NFS.

  "Requirements for Labeled NFS", Tom, 2013-08-04,
  <draft-ietf-nfsv4-labreqs-04.txt>

      This memo outlines high-level requirements for the integration of
      flexible Mandatory Access Control (MAC) functionality into the
      Network File System (NFS) version 4.2 (NFSv4.2).  It describes the
      level of protections that should be provided over protocol components
      and the basic structure of the proposed system.  The intent here is
      not to present the protocol changes, but to describe the environment
      in which they reside.

  "NFSv4 migration: Implementation experience and spec issues to resolve",
  David Noveck, Piyush Shivam, Chuck Lever, Bill Baker, 2013-03-21,
  <draft-ietf-nfsv4-migration-issues-03.txt>

      The migration feature of NFSv4 provides for moving responsibility for
      a single filesystem from one server to another, without disruption to
      clients.  Recent implementation experience has shown problems in the
      existing specification for this feature.  This document discusses the
      issues which have arisen, explores the options available for curing
      the issues, and explains the choices made in updating the NFSv4.0 and
      NFSv4.1 specifications, to address migration.

  "NFSv4.0 migration: Specification Update", David Noveck, Piyush Shivam,
  Chuck Lever, Bill Baker, 2013-08-09,
  <draft-ietf-nfsv4-rfc3530-migration-update-02.txt>

      The migration feature of NFSv4 allows for responsibility for a single
      filesystem to move from one server to another, without disruption to
      clients.  Recent implementation experience has shown problems in the
      existing specification for this feature in NFSv4.0.  This document
      clarifies and corrects the NFSv4.0 specification (RFC3530 and
      possible successors) to address these problems.

Network Time Protocol (ntp)
---------------------------

  "Network Time Security", Dieter Sibold, Stephen Roettger, 2013-07-07,
  <draft-ietf-ntp-network-time-security-00.txt>

      This document describes the Network Time Security (NTS) protocol that
      enables secure authentication of time servers using Network Time
      Protocol (NTP) or Precision Time Protocol (PTP).  Its design
      considers the special requirements of precise timekeeping, which are
      described in Security Requirements of Time Protocols in Packet
      Switched Network [I-D.ietf-tictoc-security-requirements].

Network Virtualization Overlays (nvo3)
--------------------------------------

  "Problem Statement: Overlays for Network Virtualization", Thomas Narten,
  Eric Gray, David Black, Luyuan Fang, Lawrence Kreeger, Maria Napierala,
  2013-07-31, <draft-ietf-nvo3-overlay-problem-statement-04.txt>

      This document describes issues associated with providing multi-
      tenancy in large data center networks and how these issues may be
      addressed using an overlay-based network virtualization approach.  A
      key multi-tenancy requirement is traffic isolation, so that one
      tenant's traffic is not visible to any other tenant.  Another
      requirement is address space isolation, so that different tenants can
      use the same address space within different virtual networks.
      Traffic and address space isolation is achieved by assigning one or
      more virtual networks to each tenant, where traffic within a virtual
      network can only cross into another virtual network in a controlled
      fashion (e.g., via a configured router and/or a security gateway).
      Additional functionality is required to provision virtual networks,
      associating a virtual machine's network interface(s) with the
      appropriate virtual network, and maintaining that association as the
      virtual machine is activated, migrated and/or deactivated.  Use of an
      overlay-based approach enables scalable deployment on large network
      infrastructures.

      The document "Problem Statement: Overlays for Network Virtualization"
      discusses the needs for network virtualization using overlay networks
      in highly virtualized data centers.  The problem statement outlines a
      need for control protocols to facilitate running these overlay
      networks.  This document outlines the high level requirements to be
      fulfilled by the control protocols related to building and managing
      the mapping tables and other state information used by the Network
      Virtualization Edge to transmit encapsulated packets across the
      underlying network.

Web Authorization Protocol (oauth)
----------------------------------

  "SAML 2.0 Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization
  Grants", Brian Campbell, Chuck Mortimore, Michael Jones, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-oauth-saml2-bearer-17.txt,.pdf>

      This specification defines the use of a SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion as
      a means for requesting an OAuth 2.0 access token as well as for use
      as a means of client authentication.

  "OAuth 2.0 Message Authentication Code (MAC) Tokens", Justin Richer,
  William Mills, Hannes Tschofenig, Phil Hunt, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac-04.txt>

      This specification describes how to use MAC Tokens in HTTP requests
      to access OAuth 2.0 protected resources.  An OAuth client willing to
      access a protected resource needs to demonstrate possession of a
      crytographic key by using it with a keyed message digest function to
      the request.
      
      The document also defines a key distribution protocol for obtaining a
      fresh session key.

  "Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and
  Authorization Grants", Brian Campbell, Chuck Mortimore, Michael Jones,
  Yaron Goland, 2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-oauth-assertions-12.txt,.pdf>

      This specification provides a framework for the use of assertions
      with OAuth 2.0 in the form of a new client authentication mechanism
      and a new authorization grant type.  Mechanisms are specified for
      transporting assertions during interactions with a token endpoint, as
      well as general processing rules.
      
      The intent of this specification is to provide a common framework for
      OAuth 2.0 to interwork with other identity systems using assertions,
      and to provide alternative client authentication mechanisms.
      
      Note that this specification only defines abstract message flows and
      processing rules.  In order to be implementable, companion
      specifications are necessary to provide the corresponding concrete
      instantiations.

  "JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and
  Authorization Grants", Michael Jones, Brian Campbell, Chuck Mortimore,
  2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-bearer-06.txt,.pdf>

      This specification defines the use of a JSON Web Token (JWT) Bearer
      Token as a means for requesting an OAuth 2.0 access token as well as
      for use as a means of client authentication.

  "JSON Web Token (JWT)", Michael Jones, John Bradley, Nat Sakimura,
  2013-07-29, <draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-11.txt,.pdf>

      JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact URL-safe means of representing
      claims to be transferred between two parties.  The claims in a JWT
      are encoded as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object that is
      used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the
      plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the
      claims to be digitally signed or MACed and/or encrypted.
      
      The suggested pronunciation of JWT is the same as the English word
      "jot".

  "OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol", Justin Richer, John
  Bradley, Michael Jones, Maciej Machulak, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-oauth-dyn-reg-14.txt>

      This specification defines an endpoint and protocol for dynamic
      registration of OAuth 2.0 clients at an authorization server and
      methods for the dynamically registered client to manage its
      registration through an OAuth 2.0 protected web API.

  "OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation", Torsten Lodderstedt, Stefanie Dronia,
  Marius Scurtescu, 2013-07-13, <draft-ietf-oauth-revocation-11.txt>

      This document proposes an additional endpoint for OAuth authorization
      servers, which allows clients to notify the authorization server that
      a previously obtained refresh or access token is no longer needed.
      This allows the authorization server to cleanup security credentials.
      A revocation request will invalidate the actual token and, if
      applicable, other tokens based on the same authorization grant.

  Mechanisms", Tal Mizrahi, Nurit Sprecher, Elisa Bellagamba, Yaacov
  Weingarten, 2013-07-08, <draft-ietf-opsawg-oam-overview-09.txt>

      Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a general term
      that refers to a toolset for fault detection and isolation, and for
      performance measurement. OAM mechanisms have been defined for various
      layers in the protocol stack, and are used with a variety of
      transport protocols.
      
      This document presents an overview of the data plane OAM tools that
      have been defined by the IETF.

  "CGN Deployment with BGP/MPLS IP VPNs", Victor Kuarsingh, John
  Cianfarani, 2013-06-27, <draft-ietf-opsawg-lsn-deployment-03.txt>

      This document specifies a framework to integrate a Network Address
      Translation layer into an operator's network to function as a Carrier
      Grade NAT (also known as CGN or Large Scale NAT).  The CGN
      infrastructure will often form a NAT444 environment as the subscriber
      home network will likely also maintain a subscriber side NAT
      function.  Exhaustion of the IPv4 address pool is a major driver
      compelling some operators to implement CGN.  Although operators may
      wish to deploy IPv6 to strategically overcome IPv4 exhaustion, near
      term needs may not be satisfied with an IPv6 deployment alone.  This
      document provides a practical integration model which allows the CGN
      platform to be integrated into the network meeting the connectivity
      needs of the subscriber while being mindful of not disrupting
      existing services and meeting the technical challenges that CGN
      brings.  The model included in this document utilizes BGP/MPLS IP
      VPNs which allow for virtual routing separation helping ease the CGNs
      impact on the network.  This document does not intend to defend the
      merits of CGN.

  Bhumip Khasnabish, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-ietf-opsawg-large-flow-load-balancing-04.txt>

      Demands on networking infrastructure are growing exponentially; the
      drivers are bandwidth hungry rich media applications, inter-data
      center communications, etc. In this context, it is important to
      optimally use the bandwidth in wired networks that extensively use
      LAG/ECMP techniques for bandwidth scaling. This draft explores some
      of the mechanisms useful for achieving this.

  "Hybrid-MAC Model for CAPWAP", Chunju Shao, Hui Deng, Farooq Bari, Rong
  Zhang, Satoru Matsushima, 2013-05-08,
  <draft-ietf-opsawg-capwap-hybridmac-00.txt>

      The CAPWAP protocol supports two modes of operation: Split and Local
      MAC (medium access control), which has been described in
      [RFC5415].There are many functions in IEEE 802l.11 MAC layer that
      have not yet been clearly defined whether they belong to either the
      WTP (Wireless Termination Points) or the AC (Access Controller)in the
      Split and Local modes.  Because different vendors have their own
      definition of these two models, depending upon the vendor many MAC
      layer functions continue to be mapped differently to either the WTP
      or AC.  If there is no clear definition of split MAC and local MAC,
      then operators will not only need to perform vendor specific
      configurations in their network but will continue to experience
      difficulty in interoperating WTPs and ACs from different vendors.

  Chen, Dapeng Liu, Hui Deng, Lei Zhu, 2013-05-09,
  <draft-ietf-opsawg-capwap-extension-00.txt>

      CAPWAP binding for 802.11 is specified by RFC5416 and it was based on
      IEEE 802-11.2007 standard.  After RFC5416 was published in 2009,
      there was several new amendent of 802.11 has been published.  802.11n
      is one of those amendent and it has been widely used in real
      deployment.  This document extends the CAPWAP binding for 802.11 to
      support 802.11n.

  <draft-ietf-opsec-ip-options-filtering-04.txt>

      This document provides advice on the filtering of IPv4 packets based
      on the IPv4 options they contain.  Additionally, it discusses the
      operational and interoperability implications of dropping packets
      based on the IP options they contain.

  "Using Only Link-Local Addressing Inside an IPv6 Network", Michael
  Behringer, Eric Vyncke, 2013-02-15, <draft-ietf-opsec-lla-only-03.txt>

      In an IPv6 network it is possible to use only link-local addresses on
      infrastructure links between routers.  This document discusses the
      advantages and disadvantages of this approach to help the decision
      process for a given network.

  "Security Implications of IPv6 on IPv4 Networks", Fernando Gont, Will
  Liu, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-ietf-opsec-ipv6-implications-on-ipv4-nets-05.txt>

      This document discusses the security implications of native IPv6
      support and IPv6 transition/co-existence technologies on "IPv4-only"
      networks, and describes possible mitigations for the aforementioned
      issues.

  "Operational Security Considerations for IPv6 Networks", KK
  Chittimaneni, Merike Kaeo, Eric Vyncke, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-opsec-v6-03.txt>

      Knowledge and experience on how to operate IPv4 securely is
      available: whether it is the Internet or an enterprise internal
      network.  However, IPv6 presents some new security challenges.  RFC
      4942 describes the security issues in the protocol but network
      managers also need a more practical, operations-minded best common
      practices.
      
      This document analyzes the operational security issues in all places
      of a network (service providers, enterprises and residential users)
      and proposes technical and procedural mitigations techniques.

  "Virtual Private Network (VPN) traffic leakages in dual-stack hosts/
  networks", Fernando Gont, 2013-06-24,
  <draft-ietf-opsec-vpn-leakages-01.txt>

      The subtle way in which the IPv6 and IPv4 protocols co-exist in
      typical networks, together with the lack of proper IPv6 support in
      popular Virtual Private Network (VPN) products, may inadvertently
      result in VPN traffic leaks.  That is, traffic meant to be
      transferred over a VPN connection may leak out of such connection and
      be transferred in the clear from the local network to the final
      destination.  This document discusses some scenarios in which such
      VPN leakages may occur, either as a side effect of enabling IPv6 on a
      local network, or as a result of a deliberate attack from a local
      attacker.  Additionally, it discusses possible mitigations for the
      aforementioned issue.

  "Network Reconnaissance in IPv6 Networks", Fernando Gont, Tim Chown,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-opsec-ipv6-host-scanning-02.txt>

      IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4
      counterpart.  The standard /64 IPv6 subnets can (in theory)
      accommodate approximately 1.844 * 10^19 hosts, thus resulting in a
      much lower host density (#hosts/#addresses) than is typical in IPv4
      networks, where a site typically has 65,000 or less unique addresses.
      As a result, it is widely assumed that it would take a tremendous
      effort to perform address scanning attacks against IPv6 networks, and
      therefore classic IPv6 address scanning attacks have been considered
      unfeasible.  This document updates RFC 5157 by providing further
      analysis on how traditional address scanning techniques apply to IPv6
      networks, and exploring some additional techniques that can be
      employed for IPv6 network reconnaissance.  In doing so, this document
      formally obsoletes RFC 5157.

  "BGP operations and security", Jerome Durand, Ivan Pepelnjak, Gert
  Doering, 2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-opsec-bgp-security-01.txt>

      BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the protocol almost exclusively used
      in the Internet to exchange routing information between network
      domains.  Due to this central nature, it's important to understand
      the security measures that can and should be deployed to prevent
      accidental or intentional routing disturbances.
      
      This document describes measures to protect the BGP sessions itself
      (like TTL, MD5, control plane filtering) and to better control the
      flow of routing information, using prefix filtering and
      automatization of prefix filters, max-prefix filtering, AS path
      filtering, route flap dampening and BGP community scrubbing.

Open Shortest Path First IGP (ospf)
-----------------------------------

  "OSPF Transport Instance Extensions", Acee Lindem, Abhay Roy, Sina
  Mirtorabi, 2013-04-05, <draft-ietf-ospf-transport-instance-10.txt>

      OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 include a reliable flooding mechanism to
      disseminate routing topology and Traffic Engineering (TE) information
      within a routing domain.  Given the effectiveness of these
      mechanisms, it is convenient to envision using the same mechanism for
      dissemination of other types of information within the domain.
      However, burdening OSPF with this additional information will impact
      intra-domain routing convergence and possibly jeopardize the
      stability of the OSPF routing domain.  This document presents
      mechanism to relegate this ancillary information to a separate OSPF
      instance and minimize the impact.

  "Security Extension for OSPFv2 when using Manual Key Management", Manav
  Bhatia, Sam Hartman, Dacheng Zhang, Acee Lindem, 2013-05-27,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-security-extension-manual-keying-05.txt>

      The current OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication mechanism as defined
      in the OSPF standards is vulnerable to both inter-session and intra-
      session replay attacks when its uses manual keying.  Additionally,
      the existing cryptographic authentication schemes do not cover the IP
      header.  This omission can be exploited to carry out various types of
      attacks.
      
      This draft proposes changes to the authentication sequence number
      mechanism that will protect OSPFv2 from both inter-session and intra-
      session replay attacks when its using manual keys for securing its
      protocol packets.  Additionally, we also describe some changes in the
      cryptographic hash computation so that we eliminate most attacks that
      result because OSPFv2 does not protect the IP header.

  "OSPF Stub Router Advertisement", Alvaro Retana, Liem Nguyen, Alex
  Zinin, Russ White, Danny McPherson, 2013-04-23,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-rfc3137bis-04.txt>

      This document describes a backward-compatible technique that may be
      used by OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) implementations to advertise
      a router's unavailability to forward transit traffic, or to lower the
      preference level for the paths through such a router.
      
      This document obsoletes [RFC3137].

  "Use of OSPF-MDR in Single-Hop Broadcast Networks", Richard Ogier,
  2013-08-07, <draft-ietf-ospf-manet-single-hop-mdr-04.txt>

      RFC 5614 (OSPF-MDR) extends OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks
      (MANETs) by specifying its operation on the new OSPF interface of type
      MANET.  This document describes the use of OSPF-MDR in a single-hop
      broadcast network, which is a special case of a MANET in which each
      router is a (one-hop) neighbor of each other router.  Unlike an OSPF
      broadcast interface, such an interface can have a different cost
      associated with each neighbor.  The document includes configuration
      recommendations and simplified mechanisms that can be used in single-hop
      broadcast networks.

  "OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions", Spencer Giacalone,
  David Ward, John Drake, Alia Atlas, Stefano Previdi, 2013-06-03,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-te-metric-extensions-04.txt,.pdf>

      In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
      information networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network
      performance criteria (e.g. latency) are becoming as critical to data
      path selection as other metrics.
      
      This document describes extensions to OSPF TE [RFC3630] such that
      network performance information can be distributed and collected in a
      scalable fashion. The information distributed using OSPF TE Metric
      Extensions can then be used to make path selection decisions based on
      network performance.
      
      Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which network
      performance information is distributed. The mechanisms for measuring
      network performance or acting on that information, once distributed,
      are outside the scope of this document.

  "Use of the OSPF-MANET Interface in Single-Hop Broadcast Networks",
  Alvaro Retana, Stan Ratliff, 2013-05-13,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-manet-single-hop-or-02.txt>

      This document describes the use of the OSPF-MANET interface in
      single-hop broadcast networks.  It includes a mechanism to
      dynamically determine the presence of such a network and specific
      operational considerations due to its nature.
      
      This document updates [RFC5820].

  "OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration", Acee Lindem, Jari Arkko, 2013-04-15,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig-02.txt>

      OSPFv3 is a candidate for deployments in environments where auto-
      configuration is a requirement.  One such environment is the IPv6
      home network where users expect to simply plug in a router and have
      it automatically use OSPFv3 for intra-domain routing.  This document
      describes the necessary mechanisms for OSPFv3 to be self-configuring.

Peer-to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (p2psip)
-------------------------------------------------

  "Concepts and Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP", David Bryan, Philip
  Matthews, Eunsoo Shim, Dean Willis, Spencer Dawkins, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-concepts-05.txt>

      This document defines concepts and terminology for the use of the
      Session Initiation Protocol in a peer-to-peer environment where the
      traditional proxy-registrar and message routing functions are
      replaced by a distributed mechanism.  These mechanisms may be
      implemented using a distributed hash table or other distributed data
      mechanism with similar external properties.  This document includes a
      high-level view of the functional relationships between the network
      elements defined herein, a conceptual model of operations, and an
      outline of the related problems addressed by the P2PSIP working group
      and the RELOAD protocol ([I-D.ietf-p2psip-base],
      [I-D.ietf-p2psip-sip]) defined by the working group.

  "A SIP Usage for RELOAD", Cullen Jennings, Bruce Lowekamp, Eric
  Rescorla, Salman Baset, Henning Schulzrinne, Thomas Schmidt, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-sip-11.txt>

      This document defines a SIP Usage for REsource LOcation And Discovery
      (RELOAD).  The SIP Usage provides the functionality of a SIP proxy or
      registrar in a fully-distributed system and includes a lookup service
      for Address of Records (AORs) stored in the overlay.  It also defines
      Globally Routable User Agent Uris (GRUUs) that allow the
      registrations to map an AOR to a specific node reachable through the
      overlay.  After such initial contact of a peer, the AppAttach method
      is used to establish a direct connection between nodes through which
      SIP messages are exchanged.

  "REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol", Cullen
  Jennings, Bruce Lowekamp, Eric Rescorla, Salman Baset, Henning
  Schulzrinne, 2013-02-24, <draft-ietf-p2psip-base-26.txt>

      This specification defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD),
      a peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet.  A
      P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage
      and messaging service between a set of cooperating peers that form
      the overlay network.  RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session
      Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other
      applications with similar requirements by defining new usages that
      specify the kinds of data that needs to be stored for a particular
      application.  RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificate
      enrollment service that provides unique identities.  NAT traversal is
      a fundamental service of the protocol.  RELOAD also allows access
      from "client" nodes that do not need to route traffic or store data
      for others.

  "P2P Overlay Diagnostics", Haibin Song, XingFeng Jiang, Roni Even, David
  Bryan, 2013-03-24, <draft-ietf-p2psip-diagnostics-11.txt>

      This document describes mechanisms for P2P overlay diagnostics.  It
      defines extensions to the RELOAD P2PSIP base protocol RELOAD
      [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] to collect diagnostic information, and details
      the protocol specifications for these extensions.  Useful diagnostic
      information for connection and node status monitoring is also
      defined.  The document also describes the usage scenarios and
      provides examples of how these methods are used to perform
      diagnostics in a P2PSIP overlay networks.

  "Self-tuning Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for REsource LOcation And
  Discovery (RELOAD)", Jouni Maenpaa, Gonzalo Camarillo, 2013-08-09,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-self-tuning-09.txt>

      REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) is a peer-to-peer (P2P)
      signaling protocol that provides an overlay network service.  Peers
      in a RELOAD overlay network collectively run an overlay algorithm to
      organize the overlay, and to store and retrieve data.  This document
      describes how the default topology plugin of RELOAD can be extended
      to support self-tuning, that is, to adapt to changing operating
      conditions such as churn and network size.

  "Service Discovery Usage for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD)",
  Jouni Maenpaa, Gonzalo Camarillo, 2013-08-05,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-service-discovery-09.txt>

      REsource LOcation and Discovery (RELOAD) does not define a generic
      service discovery mechanism as a part of the base protocol.  This
      document defines how the Recursive Distributed Rendezvous (ReDiR)
      service discovery mechanism used in OpenDHT can be applied to RELOAD
      overlays to provide a generic service discovery mechanism.

  "An extension to RELOAD to support Relay Peer Routing", Ning Zong,
  XingFeng Jiang, Roni Even, Yunfei Zhang, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-rpr-08.txt>

      This document proposes an optional extension to RELOAD to support
      relay peer routing mode.  RELOAD recommends symmetric recursive
      routing for routing messages.  The new optional extension provides a
      shorter route for responses reducing the overhead on intermediate
      peers and describes the potential use cases where this extension can
      be used.

  "An extension to RELOAD to support Direct Response Routing", Ning Zong,
  XingFeng Jiang, Roni Even, Yunfei Zhang, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-drr-08.txt>

      This document proposes an optional extension to RELOAD to support
      direct response routing mode.  RELOAD recommends symmetric recursive
      routing for routing messages.  The new optional extension provides a
      shorter route for responses reducing the overhead on intermediate
      peers and describes the potential cases where this extension can be
      used.

  "A Usage for Shared Resources in RELOAD (ShaRe)", Alexander Knauf,
  Thomas Schmidt, Gabriel Hege, Matthias Waehlisch, 2013-02-24,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-share-01.txt>

      This document defines a RELOAD Usage for managing shared write access
      to RELOAD Resources.  Shared Resources in RELOAD (ShaRe) form a basic
      primitive for enabling various coordination and notification schemes
      among distributed peers.  Access in ShaRe is controlled by a
      hierarchical trust delegation scheme maintained within an access
      list.  A new USER-CHAIN-ACL access policy allows authorized peers to
      write a Shared Resource without owning its corresponding certificate.
      This specification also adds mechanisms to store Resources with a
      variable name which is useful whenever peer-independent rendezvous
      processes are required.

  "A RELOAD Usage for Distributed Conference Control (DisCo)", Alexander
  Knauf, Thomas Schmidt, Gabriel Hege, Matthias Waehlisch, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-disco-02.txt>

      This document defines a RELOAD Usage for Distributed Conference
      Control (DisCo) with SIP.  DisCo preserves conference addressing
      through a single SIP URI by splitting its semantic of identifier and
      locator using a new Kind data structure.  Conference members are
      enabled to select conference controllers based on proximity awareness
      and to recover from failures of individual resource instances.  DisCo
      proposes call delegation to balance the load at focus peers.

  "Configuration of Access Control Policy in REsource LOcation And
  Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol", Marc Petit-Huguenin, 2013-02-16,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-access-control-00.txt>

      This document describes an extension to the REsource LOcation And
      Discovery (RELOAD) base protocol to distribute the code of new Access
      Control Policies without having to upgrade the RELOAD implementations
      in an overlay.

Protocol to Access WS database (paws)
-------------------------------------

  "Protocol to Access Spectrum Database", Vincent Chen, Subir Das, Lei
  Zhu, John Malyar, Pete McCann, 2013-06-19,
  <draft-ietf-paws-protocol-06.txt>

      Portions of the radio spectrum that are allocated to licensees are
      available for non-interfering use.  This available spectrum is called
      "White Space."  Allowing secondary users access to available spectrum
      "unlocks" existing spectrum to maximize its utilization and to
      provide opportunities for innovation, resulting in greater overall
      spectrum utilization.
      
      One approach to manage spectrum sharing uses databases to report
      spectrum availability to devices.  To achieve interoperability among
      multiple devices and databases, a standardized protocol must be
      defined and implemented.  This document defines such a protocol, the
      "Protocol to Access White Space database" (PAWS).

Audio/Video Transport Payloads (payload)

      This document specifies a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload
      format to be used for the low complexity subband codec (SBC), which
      is the mandatory audio codec of the Advanced Audio Distribution
      Profile (A2DP) Specification written by the Bluetooth(r) Special
      Interest Group (SIG). The payload format is designed to be able to
      interoperate with existing Bluetooth A2DP devices, to provide high
      streaming audio quality, interactive audio transmission over the
      internet, and ultra-low delay coding for jam sessions on the
      internet. This document contains also a media type registration
      which specifies the use of the RTP payload format.

      payload format for ITU-T Recommendation G.711.0.  ITU-T Rec. G.711.0
      defines a lossless and stateless compression for G.711 packet
      payloads typically used in IP networks.  This document also defines a
      storage mode format for G.711.0 and a media type registration for the
      G.711.0 RTP payload format.

  "RTP Payload Format for High Efficiency Video Coding", Ye-Kui Wang, Yago
  Sanchez, Thomas Schierl, Stephan Wenger, Miska Hannuksela, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-ietf-payload-rtp-h265-00.txt>

      This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding
      standard  ITU-T  Recommendation  H.265  and  ISO/IEC  International
      Standard 23008-2, both also known as High Efficiency Video Coding
      (HEVC) [HEVC], developed by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video
      Coding (JCT-VC).  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of
      one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet
      payload, as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP
      packets.  Furthermore, it supports transmission of an HEVC stream
      over a single as well as multiple RTP flows.  The payload format has
      wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming,
      and high bit-rate entertainment-quality video, among others.

      The Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) is used to convey path
      computation requests and responses between Path Computation Clients
      (PCCs) and Path Computation Elements (PCEs), and also between
      cooperating PCEs.  In PCEP the path computation requests carry
      details of the constraints and objective functions that the PCC
      wishes the PCE to apply in its computation.
      
      This document defines a facility to carry vendor-specific information
      in PCEP using a dedicated object and a new Type-Length-Variable that
      can be carried in any existing PCEP object.

  "PCEP Requirements for WSON Routing and Wavelength Assignment", Young
  Lee, Greg Bernstein, Jonas Martensson, Tomonori Takeda, Takehiro
  Tsuritani, Oscar de Dios, 2013-06-27,
  <draft-ietf-pce-wson-routing-wavelength-09.txt>

      This memo provides application-specific requirements for the Path
      Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) for the support of
      Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON). Lightpath provisioning
      in WSONs requires a routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) process.
      From a path computation perspective, wavelength assignment is the
      process of determining which wavelength can be used on each hop of a
      path and forms an additional routing constraint to optical light
      path computation. Requirements for Optical impairments will be
      addressed in a separate document.

  "PCEP extensions for GMPLS", Cyril Margaria, Oscar de Dios, Fatai Zhang,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-pce-gmpls-pcep-extensions-08.txt>

      This memo provides extensions for the Path Computation Element
      communication Protocol (PCEP) for the support of GMPLS control plane.

  "Applicability of the Path Computation Element to Inter-Area and
  Inter-AS MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering", Daniel King, Julien
  Meuric, Olivier Dugeon, Quintin Zhao, Oscar de Dios, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-pce-inter-area-as-applicability-03.txt>

      The Path Computation Element (PCE) may be used for computing services
      that traverse multi-area and multi-AS Multiprotocol Label Switching
      (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered (TE) networks.
      
      This document examines the applicability of the PCE architecture,
      protocols, and protocol extensions for computing multi-area and
      multi-AS paths in MPLS and GMPLS networks.

  "PCE-based Computation Procedure To Compute Shortest Constrained P2MP
  Inter-domain Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths", Quintin Zhao,
  Dhruv Dhody, Zafar Ali, Daniel King, Ramon Casellas, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-pce-pcep-inter-domain-p2mp-procedures-05.txt>

      The ability to compute paths for constrained point-to-multipoint
      (P2MP) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) across
      multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement for the
      deployment of P2MP services in MPLS and GMPLS-controlled networks.
      The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been recognized as an
      appropriate technology for the determination of inter-domain paths of
      P2MP TE LSPs.
      
      This document describes an experiment to provide procedures and
      extensions to the PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) for the
      computation of inter-domain paths for P2MP TE LSPs.

  "PCEP Extensions for Stateful PCE", Edward Crabbe, Jan Medved, Ina
  Minei, Robert Varga, 2013-07-01, <draft-ietf-pce-stateful-pce-05.txt>

      The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
      mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
      computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
      
      Although PCEP explicitly makes no assumptions regarding the
      information available to the PCE, it also makes no provisions for
      synchronization or PCE control of timing and sequence of path
      computations within and across PCEP sessions.  This document
      describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of
      MPLS-TE and GMPLS LSPs via PCEP.

  "Standard Representation Of Domain-Sequence", Dhruv Dhody, Udayasree
  Palle, Ramon Casellas, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-ietf-pce-pcep-domain-sequence-03.txt>

      The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label
      Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
      Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been
      identified as a key requirement.  In this context, a domain is a
      collection of network elements within a common sphere of address
      management or path computational responsibility such as an Interior
      Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an Autonomous Systems (AS).  This
      document specifies a standard representation and encoding of a
      Domain-Sequence, which is defined as an ordered sequence of domains
      traversed to reach the destination domain to be used by Path
      Computation Elements (PCEs) to compute inter-domain shortest
      constrained paths across a predetermined sequence of domains .  This
      document also defines new subobjects to be used to encode domain
      identifiers.

  "Extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
  (PCEP) to compute service aware Label Switched Path (LSP).", Dhruv
  Dhody, Vishwas Manral, Zafar Ali, George Swallow, Kenji Kumaki,
  2013-07-09, <draft-ietf-pce-pcep-service-aware-01.txt>

      In certain networks like financial information network (stock/
      commodity trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications,
      Latency (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet Loss is
      becoming a key requirement for path computation along with other
      constraints and metrics.  Latency, Latency-Variation and Packet Loss
      is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between
      customers and service providers.
      
      [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS] describes mechanisms with
      which network performance information is distributed via OSPF and
      ISIS respectively.  The Path Computation Element Communication
      Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements
      (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation
      Clients (PCCs) requests.  This document describes the extension to
      PCEP to carry Latency, Latency-Variation and Loss as constraints for
      end to end path computation.

  "PCEP Extension for WSON Routing and Wavelength Assignment", Young Lee,
  Ramon Casellas, 2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-pce-wson-rwa-ext-01.txt>

      This document provides the Path Computation Element communication
      Protocol (PCEP) extensions for the support of Routing and Wavelength
      Assignment (RWA) in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON).
      Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a routing and wavelength
      assignment (RWA) process.  From a path computation perspective,
      wavelength assignment is the process of determining which wavelength
      can be used on each hop of a path and forms an additional routing
      constraint to optical light path computation.

  "Unanswered Questions in the Path Computation Element Architecture",
  Adrian Farrel, Daniel King, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-ietf-pce-questions-00.txt>

      The Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture is set out in RFC
      4655. The architecture is extended for multi-layer networking with
      the introduction of the Virtual Network Topology Manager in RFC
      5623, and generalized to Hierarchical PCE in RFC 6805.
      
      These three architectural views of PCE deliberately leave some key
      questions unanswered especially with respect to the interactions
      between architectural components.  This document draws out those
      questions and discusses them in an architectural context with
      reference to other architectural components, existing protocols, and
      recent IETF work efforts.
      
      This document does not update the architecture documents and does not
      define how protocols or components must be used.  It does, however,
      suggest how the architectural components might be combined to provide
      advanced PCE function.

  "DHCP Options for the Port Control Protocol (PCP)", Mohamed Boucadair,
  Reinaldo Penno, Dan Wing, 2013-08-06, <draft-ietf-pcp-dhcp-08.txt>

      This document specifies DHCP (IPv4 and IPv6) options to configure
      hosts with Port Control Protocol (PCP) Server IP addresses.  The use
      of DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 depends on the PCP deployment scenario.

  "Port Control Protocol (PCP) Proxy Function", Mohamed Boucadair,
  Reinaldo Penno, Dan Wing, 2013-07-28, <draft-ietf-pcp-proxy-04.txt>

      This document specifies a new PCP functional element denoted as a PCP
      Proxy.  The PCP Proxy relays PCP requests received from PCP clients
      to upstream PCP server(s).  A typical deployment usage of this
      function is to help establish successful PCP communications for PCP
      clients that can not be configured with the address of a PCP server
      located more than one hop away.

      This document specifies the behavior to be followed by the PCP client
      to contact its PCP server(s) when one or several PCP server names are
      configured.  Multiple names may be configured to a PCP client in some
      deployment contexts such as multi-homing.

  "Learning NAT64 PREFIX64s using PCP", Mohamed Boucadair, 2013-07-30,
  <draft-ietf-pcp-nat64-prefix64-04.txt>

      This document defines a new PCP extension to learn the IPv6
      prefix(es) used by a PCP-controlled NAT64 device to build
      IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses.  This extension is needed for
      successful communications when IPv4 addresses are used in referrals.

      This document defines an extension to PCP allowing clients to
      manipulate sets of ports as a whole.  This is accomplished by a new
      MAP option: PORT_SET.

  "The Port Control Protocol in Dual-Stack Lite environments", Francis

Protocol Independent Multicast (pim)
------------------------------------

  "IGMP/MLD-Based Explicit Membership Tracking Function for Multicast
  Routers", Hitoshi Asaeda, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-ietf-pim-explicit-tracking-07.txt>

      This document describes the IGMP/MLD-based explicit membership
      tracking function for multicast routers and IGMP/MLD proxy devices
      supporting IGMPv3/MLDv2.  The explicit membership tracking function
      contributes to saving network resources and shortening leave latency.

  "Protocol Independent Multicast DR Load Balancing", Yiqun Cai, Sri
  Vallepalli, Heidi Ou, Andy Green, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-pim-drlb-02.txt>

      On a multi-access network such as an Ethernet, one of the PIM routers
      is elected as a Designated Router (DR).  The PIM DR has two roles in
      the PIM protocol.  On the first hop network, the PIM DR is
      responsible for registering an active source to the RP if the group
      is operated in PIM SM.  On the last hop network, the PIM DR is
      responsible for tracking local multicast listeners and forwarding
      traffic to these listeners if the group is operated in PIM SM/SSM/DM.
      In this document, we propose a modification to the PIM protocol that
      allows more than one of these last hop routers to be selected so that
      the forwarding load can be distributed to and handled among these
      routers.  A router responsible for forwarding for a particular group
      is called a Group Designated Router (GDR).

----------------------------------------

  "Enrollment over Secure Transport", Max Pritikin, Peter Yee, Dan
  Harkins, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-pkix-est-08.txt>

      This document profiles certificate enrollment for clients using
      Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) messages over a secure
      transport.  This profile, called Enrollment over Secure Transport
      (EST), describes a simple yet functional certificate management
      protocol targeting Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) clients that need
      to acquire client certificates and associated Certification Authority
      (CA) certificate(s).  It also supports client-generated public/
      private key pairs as well as key pairs generated by the CA.

Peer to Peer Streaming Protocol (ppsp)
--------------------------------------

  "Survey of P2P Streaming Applications", Gu Yingjie, Ning Zong, Yunfei
  Zhang, Francesca Piccolo, Shihui Duan, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-ietf-ppsp-survey-05.txt>

      This document presents a survey of some of the most popular Peer-to-
      Peer (P2P) streaming applications on the Internet.  Main selection
      criteria have been popularity and availability of information on
      operation details at writing time.  In doing this, selected
      applications are not reviewed as a whole, but they are reviewed with
      main focus on the signaling and control protocol used to establish
      and maintain overlay connections among peers and to advertise and
      download streaming content.

  "Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol (PPSPP)", A. Bakker, Riccardo
  Petrocco, Victor Grishchenko, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-ppsp-peer-protocol-07.txt>

      The Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol (PPSPP) is a protocol for
      disseminating the same content to a group of interested parties in a
      streaming fashion.  PPSPP supports streaming of both pre-recorded
      (on-demand) and live audio/video content.  It is based on the peer-
      to-peer paradigm, where clients consuming the content are put on
      equal footing with the servers initially providing the content, to
      create a system where everyone can potentially provide upload
      bandwidth.  It has been designed to provide short time-till-playback
      for the end user, and to prevent disruption of the streams by
      malicious peers.  PPSPP has also been designed to be flexible and
      extensible.  It can use different mechanisms to optimize peer
      uploading, prevent freeriding, and work with different peer discovery
      schemes (centralized trackers or Distributed Hash Tables).  It
      supports multiple methods for content integrity protection and chunk
      addressing.  Designed as a generic protocol that can run on top of
      various transport protocols, it currently runs on top of UDP using
      LEDBAT for congestion control.

  "PPSP Tracker Protocol-Base Protocol (PPSP-TP/1.0)", Rui Cruz, Mario
  Nunes, Gu Yingjie, Jinwei Xia, Joao Taveira, Deng Lingli, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-ietf-ppsp-base-tracker-protocol-01.txt>

      This document specifies the base Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol-
      Tracker Protocol (PPSP-TP/1.0), an application-layer control
      (signaling) protocol for the exchange of meta information between
      trackers and peers.  The specification outlines the architecture of
      the protocol and its functionality, and describes message flows,
      message processing instructions, message formats, formal syntax and
      semantics.  The PPSP Tracker Protocol enables cooperating peers to
      form content streaming overlay networks to support near real-time
      Structured Media content delivery (audio, video, associated timed
      text and metadata), such as adaptive multi-rate, layered (scalable)
      and multi-view (3D) videos, in live, time-shifted and on-demand
      modes.

Preparation and Comparison of Internationalized Strings (precis)
----------------------------------------------------------------

  "PRECIS Framework: Preparation and Comparison of Internationalized
  Strings in Application Protocols", Peter Saint-Andre, Marc Blanchet,
  2013-07-10, <draft-ietf-precis-framework-09.txt>

      Application protocols using Unicode code points in protocol strings
      need to properly prepare such strings in order to perform valid
      comparison operations (e.g., for purposes of authentication or
      authorization).  This document defines a framework enabling
      application protocols to perform the preparation and comparison of
      internationalized strings (a.k.a.  "PRECIS") in a way that depends on
      the properties of Unicode code points and thus is agile with respect
      to versions of Unicode.  As a result, this framework provides a more
      sustainable approach to the handling of internationalized strings
      than the previous framework, known as Stringprep (RFC 3454).  A
      specification that reuses this framework can either directly use the
      PRECIS string classes or subclass the PRECIS string classes as
      needed.  This framework takes an approach similar to the revised
      internationalized domain names (IDNs) in applications (IDNA)
      technology (RFC 5890, RFC 5891, RFC 5892, RFC 5893, RFC 5894) and
      thus adheres to the high-level design goals described in the IAB's
      recommendations regarding IDNs (RFC 4690), albeit for application
      technologies other than the Domain Name System (DNS).  This document
      obsoletes RFC 3454.

  "Preparation and Comparison of Nicknames", Peter Saint-Andre,
  2013-07-10, <draft-ietf-precis-nickname-06.txt>

      This document describes how to prepare and compare Unicode strings
      representing nicknames, primarily for use within textual chatrooms.
      This profile is intended to be used by messaging and text
      conferencing technologies such as the Extensible Messaging and
      Presence Protocol (XMPP), the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP),
      and Centralized Conferencing (XCON).

  "Mapping characters for PRECIS classes", Yoshiro Yoneya, Takahiro
  NEMOTO, 2013-08-06, <draft-ietf-precis-mappings-03.txt>

      The framework for preparation and comparison of internationalized
      strings ("PRECIS") defines several classes of strings for preparation
      and comparison.  In the framework, case mapping is defined because
      many protocols handle case-sensitive or case-insensitive string
      comparison and therefore preparation of the string is mandatory.  As
      described in the mapping for Internationalized Domain Names in
      Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS problem statement, mappings for
      internationalized strings are not limited to case, but also width
      mapping and mapping of delimiters and other specials can be taken
      into consideration.  This document provides guidelines for authors of
      protocol profiles of the PRECIS framework and describes several
      mappings that can be applied between receiving user input and passing
      permitted code points to internationalized protocols.  The mappings
      described here are expected to be applied as Additional mapping in the
      PRECIS framework.

  "Preparation and Comparison of Internationalized Strings Representing
  Usernames and Passwords", Peter Saint-Andre, Alexey Melnikov,
  2013-08-04, <draft-ietf-precis-saslprepbis-04.txt>

      This document describes how to handle Unicode strings representing
      usernames and passwords.  This profile is intended to be used by
      protocols that exchange or otherwise make use of usernames and
      passwords.  This document obsoletes RFC 4013.

Pseudowire Emulation Edge to Edge (pwe3)
----------------------------------------

  "Dynamic Placement of Multi Segment Pseudowires", Luca Martini, Matthew
  Bocci, Florin Balus, 2013-06-19, <draft-ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw-17.txt>

      There is a requirement for service providers to be able to extend the
      reach of pseudowires (PW) across multiple Packet Switched Network
      domains. A Multi-Segment PW is defined as a set of two or more
      contiguous PW segments that behave and function as a single point-
      to-point PW. This document describes extensions to the PW control
      protocol to dynamically place the segments of the multi segment
      pseudowire among a set of Provider Edge (PE) routers.

  "MPLS and Ethernet OAM Interworking", Dinesh Mohan, Nabil Bitar, Ali
  Sajassi, Simon DeLord, Philippe Niger, Ray Qiu, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-eth-oam-iwk-08.txt>

      This document specifies the mapping of defect states between
      Ethernet Attachment Circuits (ACs) and associated Ethernet
      Pseudowires (PWs) connected in accordance to the PWE3 architecture
      to realize an end-to-end emulated Ethernet service. It standardizes
      the behavior of Provider Edges (PEs) with respect to Ethernet PW
      and AC defects.

  "Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol for L2VPN PE Redundancy", Luca
  Martini, Samer Salam, Ali Sajassi, Satoru Matsushima, 2013-02-21,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-iccp-11.txt>

      This document specifies an inter-chassis communication protocol
      (ICCP) that enables Provider Edge (PE) device redundancy for Virtual
      Private Wire Service (VPWS) and Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)
      applications. The protocol runs within a set of two or more PEs,
      forming a redundancy group, for the purpose of synchronizing data
      amongst the systems. It accommodates multi-chassis attachment circuit
      as well as pseudowire redundancy mechanisms.

  "MPLS LSP PW status refresh reduction for Static Pseudowires", Luca
  Martini, George Swallow, Elisa Bellagamba, 2013-02-20,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-status-reduction-01.txt>

      This document describes a method for generating an aggregated
      pseudowire status message on Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
      network Label Switched Path (LSP).
      
      The method for transmitting the pseudowire (PW) status information is
      not new, however this protocol extension allows a Service Provider
      (SP) to reliably monitor the individual PW status while not
      overwhelming the network of multiple periodic status messages. This
      is achieved by sending a single cumulative summary status
      verification message for all the PWs grouped in the same LSP.

  "The Pseudowire (PW) & Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)
  Implementation Survey Results", Andrew Malis, 2013-06-27,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-vccv-impl-survey-results-01.txt>

      Most pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations mandate
      the use of the Control Word (CW) to carry information essential to
      the emulation, to inhibit ECMP behavior, and to discriminate OAM from
      PW packets.  However, some encapsulations treat the Control Word as
      optional.  As a result, implementations of the CW, for encapsulations
      for which it is optional, vary by equipment manufacturer, equipment
      model and service provider network.  Similarly, Virtual Circuit
      Connectivity Verification (VCCV) supports three Control Channel (CC)
      types and multiple Connectivity Verification (CV) Types.  This
      flexibility has led to reports of interoperability issues within
      deployed networks and associated drafts to attempt to remedy the
      situation.  This survey of the PW/VCCV user community was conducted
      to determine implementation trends.  The survey and results is
      presented herein.

  "Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance using the Label Distribution
  Protocol", Luca Martini, Giles Heron, 2013-02-20,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-rfc4447bis-01.txt>

      Layer 2 services (such as Frame Relay, Asynchronus Transfer Mode, and
      Ethernet) can be "emulated" over an MPLS backbone by encapsulating
      the Layer 2 Packet Data Units (PDU) and then transmitting them over
      "pseudowires". It is also possible to use pseudowires to provide
      low-rate Time Dividion Multiplexed and Synchronous Optical NETworking
      circuit emulation over a MPLS-enabled network. This document
      specifies a protocol for establishing and maintaining the
      pseudowires, using extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol
      (LDP).  Procedures for encapsulating Layer 2 PDUs are specified in a
      set of companion documents.

  "LDP extensions for Pseudowire Binding to LSP Tunnels", Mach Chen, Wei
  Cao, Attila Takacs, Ping Pan, 2013-06-03,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-tp-pw-over-bidir-lsp-01.txt>

      Many transport services require that user traffic, in the forms of
      Pseudowires (PW), to be delivered on a single co-routed bidirectional
      LSP or two LSPs that share the same routes.  In addition, the user
      traffic may traverse through multiple transport networks.
      
      This document specifies an optional extension in LDP that enable the
      binding between PWs and the underlying LSPs.

  "Pseudowire Redundancy on S-PE", Jie Dong, Haibo Wang, 2013-06-21,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-redundancy-spe-01.txt>

      This document describes Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) protection
      scenarios in which the pseudowire redundancy is provided on the
      Switching-PE (S-PE).  Operations of the S-PEs which provide PW
      redundancy are specified in this document.  Signaling of the
      preferential forwarding status as defined in [RFC6870] is reused.
      This document does not require any change to the T-PEs of MS-PW.

  "VCCV MPLS-TP Connectivity Verification (CV) Capability Advertisement",
  Greg Mirsky, 2013-04-08, <draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-tp-cv-adv-00.txt>

      This document specifies how use of proactive Connectivity
      Verification, Continuity Check, and Remote Defect Indication for the
      MPLS Transport Profile [RFC6428] affects operation and management
      function election for PW VCCV [RFC5085], [RFC5885].

IMAP QRESYNC Extension (qresync)
--------------------------------

  "IMAP4 Extensions for Quick Mailbox Resynchronization", Alexey Melnikov,
  Dave Cridland, 2013-07-02, <draft-ietf-qresync-rfc5162bis-02.txt>

      This document defines an IMAP4 extension, which gives an IMAP client
      the ability to quickly resynchronize any previously opened mailbox as
      part of the SELECT command, without the need for server-side state or
      additional client round-trips.  This extension also introduces a new
      response that allows for a more compact representation of a list of
      expunged messages (and always includes the Unique Identifiers (UIDs)
      expunged).

  "IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE Operation or Quick Flag Changes
  Resynchronization", Alexey Melnikov, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-ietf-qresync-rfc4551bis-02.txt>

      Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate changes to
      a common IMAP mailbox.  Examples include different clients working on
      behalf of the same user, and multiple users accessing shared
      mailboxes.  These clients need a mechanism to synchronize state
      changes for messages within the mailbox.  They must be able to
      guarantee that only one client can change message state (e.g.,
      message flags) at any time.  An example of such an application is use
      of an IMAP mailbox as a message queue with multiple dequeueing
      clients.
      
      The Conditional Store facility provides a protected update mechanism
      for message state information that can detect and resolve conflicts
      between multiple writing mail clients.
      
      The Conditional Store facility also allows a client to quickly
      resynchronize mailbox flag changes.
      
      This document defines an extension to IMAP (RFC 3501).

RADIUS EXTensions (radext)
--------------------------

  "NAI-based Dynamic Peer Discovery for RADIUS/TLS and RADIUS/DTLS",
  Stefan Winter, Mike McCauley, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-ietf-radext-dynamic-discovery-07.txt>

      This document specifies a means to find authoritative RADIUS servers
      for a given realm.  It is used in conjunction with either RADIUS/TLS
      and RADIUS/DTLS.

  "DTLS as a Transport Layer for RADIUS", Alan DeKok, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-ietf-radext-dtls-06.txt>

      The RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] has limited support for authentication
      and encryption of RADIUS packets.  The protocol transports data "in
      the clear", although some parts of the packets can have "obfuscated"
      content.  Packets may be replayed verbatim by an attacker, and
      client-server authentication is based on fixed shared secrets.  This
      document specifies how the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
      protocol may be used as a fix for these problems.  It also describes
      how implementations of this proposal can co-exist with current RADIUS
      systems.

  "RADIUS Attributes for IEEE 802 Networks", Bernard Aboba, Jouni Malinen,
  Paul Congdon, Joseph Salowey, Mark Jones, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-radext-ieee802ext-08.txt>

      RFC 3580 provides guidelines for the use of the Remote Authentication
      Dialin User Service (RADIUS) within IEEE 802 local area networks
      (LANs).  This document proposes additional attributes for use within
      IEEE 802 networks, as well as clarifications on the usage of the EAP-
      Key-Name attribute, updating RFC 4072.  The attributes defined in
      this document are usable both within RADIUS and Diameter.

  "The Network Access Identifier", Alan DeKok, 2013-05-23,
  <draft-ietf-radext-nai-03.txt>

      In order to provide inter-domain authentication services, it is
      necessary to have a standardized method that domains can use to
      identify each others users.  This document defines the syntax for the
      Network Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity submitted by the
      client prior to accessing network resources. This document is a
      revised version of RFC 4282 [RFC4282], which addresses issues with
      international character sets, as well as a number of other
      corrections to the previous document.

Reputation Services (repute)
----------------------------

  "A Reputation Query Protocol", Nathaniel Borenstein, Murray Kucherawy,
  2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-repute-query-http-09.txt>

      This document defines a mechanism to conduct queries for reputation
      information over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol using JSON as the
      payload meta-format.

  "A Media Type for Reputation Interchange", Nathaniel Borenstein, Murray
  Kucherawy, 2013-07-18, <draft-ietf-repute-media-type-10.txt>

      This document defines the format of reputation response data
      ("reputons"), the media-type for packaging it, and definition of a
      registry for the names of reputation applications and response sets.

  "A Reputation Response Set for Email Identifiers", Nathaniel Borenstein,
  Murray Kucherawy, 2013-06-06,
  <draft-ietf-repute-email-identifiers-08.txt>

      This document defines a response set for describing assertions a
      reputation service provider can make about email identifers, for use
      in generating reputons.

  "A Model for Reputation Reporting", Nathaniel Borenstein, Murray
  Kucherawy, Andrew Sullivan, 2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-repute-model-07.txt>

      This document describes a general architecture for a reputation-based
      service and a model for requesting reputation-related data over the
      Internet, where "reputation" refers to predictions or expectations
      about an entity or an identifier such as a domain name.  The document
      roughly follows the recommendations of RFC4101 for describing a
      protocol model.

  "Operational Considerations Regarding Reputation Services", Murray
  Kucherawy, 2013-05-20, <draft-ietf-repute-considerations-02.txt>

      The use of reputation systems is has become a common tool in many
      applications that seek to apply collected intelligence about traffic
      sources.  Often this is done because it is common or even expected
      operator practice.  It is therefore important to be aware of a number
      of considerations for both operators and consumers of the data.  This
      document includes a collection of the best advice available regarding
      providers and consumers of reputation data, based on experience to
      date.  Much of this is based on experience with email reputation
      systems, but the concepts are generally applicable.

RTP Media Congestion Avoidance Techniques (rmcat)
-------------------------------------------------

  "Evaluating Congestion Control for Interactive Real-time Media", Varun
  Singh, Joerg Ott, 2013-07-15, <draft-singh-rmcat-cc-eval-03.txt>

      The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to transmit media in
      telephony and video conferencing applications.  This document
      describes the guidelines to evaluate new congestion control
      algorithms for interactive point-to-point real-time media.

  "Congestion Control Requirements For RMCAT", Randell Jesup, 2013-07-19,
  <draft-ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements-00.txt>

      Congestion control is needed for all data transported across the
      Internet, in order to promote fair usage and prevent congestion
      collapse.  The requirements for interactive, point-to-point real time
      multimedia, which needs by low-delay, semi-reliable data delivery,
      are different from the requirements for bulk transfer like FTP or
      bursty transfers like Web pages, and the TCP algorithms are not
      suitable for this traffic.
      
      This document attempts to describe a set of requirements that can be
      used to evaluate other congestion control mechanisms in order to
      figure out their fitness for this purpose, and in particular to
      provide a set of possible requirements for proposals coming out of
      the RMCAT Working Group.
      
      This document is derived from draft-jesup-rtp-congestion-reqs
      [I-D.jesup-rtp-congestion-reqs].

Reliable Multicast Transport (rmt)
----------------------------------

  "Security and Reliable Multicast Transport Protocols: Discussions and
  Guidelines", Brian Adamson, Vincent Roca, Hitoshi Asaeda, 2013-05-17,
  <draft-ietf-rmt-sec-discussion-08.txt,.pdf>

      This document describes general security considerations for Reliable
      Multicast Transport (RMT) building blocks and protocols.  An emphasis
      is placed on risks that might be resolved in the scope of transport
      protocol design.  However, relevant security issues related to IP
      Multicast control-plane and other concerns not strictly within the
      scope of reliable transport protocol design are also discussed.  The
      document also begins an exploration of approaches that could be
      embraced to mitigate these risks.  The purpose of this document is to
      provide a consolidated security discussion and provide a basis for
      further discussions and potential resolution of any significant
      security issues that may exist in the current set of RMT standards.

Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks (roll)
------------------------------------------------

  "Terminology in Low power And Lossy Networks", JP Vasseur, 2013-03-12,
  <draft-ietf-roll-terminology-12.txt>

      The documents defines a terminology for discussing routing
      requirements and solutions for networks referred to as Low power and
      Lossy Networks (LLN).  An LLN is typically composed of many embedded
      devices with limited power, memory, and processing resources
      interconnected by a variety of links.  There is a wide scope of
      application areas for LLNs, including industrial monitoring, building
      automation (e.g.  Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning, lighting,
      access control, fire), connected home, healthcare, environmental
      monitoring, urban sensor networks, energy management, assets
      tracking, refrigeration.

  "Reactive Discovery of Point-to-Point Routes in Low Power and Lossy
  Networks", Mukul Goyal, Emmanuel Baccelli, Matthias Philipp, Anders
  Brandt, Jerry Martocci, 2013-03-20, <draft-ietf-roll-p2p-rpl-17.txt>

      This document specifies a point-to-point route discovery mechanism,
      complementary to the RPL core functionality.  This mechanism allows
      an IPv6 router to discover "on demand" routes to one or more IPv6
      routers in the LLN such that the discovered routes meet specified
      metrics constraints.

  "Multicast Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (MPL)", Jonathan
  Hui, Richard Kelsey, 2013-02-25, <draft-ietf-roll-trickle-mcast-04.txt>

      This document specifies the Multicast Protocol for Low power and
      Lossy Networks (MPL) that provides IPv6 multicast forwarding in
      constrained networks.  MPL avoids the need to construct or maintain
      any multicast forwarding topology, disseminating messages to all MPL
      Forwarders in an MPL Domain.  MPL uses the Trickle algorithm to
      manage message transmissions for both control and data-plane
      messages.  Different Trickle parameter configurations allow MPL to
      trade between dissemination latency and transmission efficiency.

  "A Mechanism to Measure the Routing Metrics along a Point-to-point Route
  in a Low Power and Lossy Network", Mukul Goyal, Emmanuel Baccelli,
  Anders Brandt, Jerry Martocci, 2013-04-01,
  <draft-ietf-roll-p2p-measurement-10.txt>

      This document specifies a mechanism that enables an RPL router to
      measure the aggregated values of given routing metrics along an
      existing route towards another RPL router, thereby allowing the
      router to decide if it wants to initiate the discovery of a better
      route.

  Networks", Tzeta Tsao, Roger Alexander, Mischa Dohler, Vanesa Daza,
  Angel Lozano, 2013-06-26, <draft-ietf-roll-security-threats-03.txt>

      This document presents a security threat analysis for routing over
      low-power and lossy networks (LLN).  The development builds upon
      previous work on routing security and adapts the assessments to the
      issues and constraints specific to low-power and lossy networks.  A
      systematic approach is used in defining and evaluating the security
      threats.  Applicable countermeasures are application specific and are
      addressed in relevant applicability statements.  These assessments
      provide the basis of the security recommendations for incorporation
      into low-power, lossy network routing protocols.

  "ROLL Applicability Statement Template", Michael Richardson, 2013-06-27,
  <draft-ietf-roll-applicability-template-01.txt>

      This document is a template applicability statement for the Routing
      over Low-power and Lossy Networks (ROLL) WG.  This document is not
      for publication, but rather is to be used as a template.

  "RPL applicability in industrial networks", Tom Phinney, Pascal Thubert,
  Robert Assimiti, 2013-03-12,
  <draft-ietf-roll-rpl-industrial-applicability-00.txt>

      The wide deployment of wireless devices, with their low installed
      cost (compared to wired devices), will significantly improve the
      productivity and safety of industrial plants.  It will simultaneously
      increase the efficiency and safety of the plant's workers, by
      extending and making more timely the information set available about
      plant operations.  The new Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy
      Networks (RPL) defines a Distance Vector protocol that is designed
      for such networks.  The aim of this document is to analyze the
      applicability of that routing protocol in industrial LLNs formed of
      field devices.

  "Applicability Statement: The use of the RPL protocol set in Home
  Automation and Building Control", Anders Brandt, Emmanuel Baccelli,
  Robert Cragie, Peter Van der Stok, 2013-05-13,

      The purpose of this document is to provide guidance in the selection
      and use of RPL protocols to implement the features required in
      building and home environments.

  "Overview: Real Time Protocols for Brower-based Applications", Harald
  Alvestrand, 2013-02-20, <draft-ietf-rtcweb-overview-06.txt>

      This document gives an overview and context of a protocol suite
      intended for use with real-time applications that can be deployed in
      browsers - "real time communication on the Web".
      
      It intends to serve as a starting and coordination point to make sure
      all the parts that are needed to achieve this goal are findable, and
      that the parts that belong in the Internet protocol suite are fully
      specified and on the right publication track.
      
      This document is a work item of the RTCWEB working group.

  Colin Perkins, Magnus Westerlund, Joerg Ott, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage-07.txt>

      The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) framework provides support
      for direct interactive rich communication using audio, video, text,
      collaboration, games, etc.  between two peers' web-browsers.  This
      memo describes the media transport aspects of the WebRTC framework.
      It specifies how the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in
      the WebRTC context, and gives requirements for which RTP features,
      profiles, and extensions need to be supported.

  "Security Considerations for WebRTC", Eric Rescorla, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-rtcweb-security-05.txt>

      The Real-Time Communications on the Web (RTCWEB) working group is
      tasked with standardizing protocols for real-time communications
      between Web browsers, generally called "WebRTC".  The major use cases
      for WebRTC technology are real-time audio and/or video calls, Web
      conferencing, and direct data transfer.  Unlike most conventional
      real-time systems (e.g., SIP-based soft phones) WebRTC communications
      are directly controlled by a Web server, which poses new security
      challenges.  For instance, a Web browser might expose a JavaScript
      API which allows a server to place a video call.  Unrestricted access
      to such an API would allow any site which a user visited to "bug" a
      user's computer, capturing any activity which passed in front of
      their camera.  This document defines the WebRTC threat model and
      analyzes the security threats of WebRTC in that model.

  "WebRTC Security Architecture", Eric Rescorla, 2013-07-15,

      session via the interface specified in the W3C RTCPeerConnection API,
      and discusses how this relates to existing signaling protocols.

  "RTCWeb Data Channels", Randell Jesup, Salvatore Loreto, Michael Tuexen,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-rtcweb-data-channel-05.txt>

      The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) working group is charged to
      provide protocol support for direct interactive rich communication
      using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-browsers.  This
      document specifies the non-media data transport aspects of the WebRTC
      framework.  It provides an architectural overview of how the Stream
      Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is used in the WebRTC context as
      a generic transport service allowing Web Browser to exchange generic
      data from peer to peer.

Routing Area Working Group (rtgwg)
----------------------------------

  "Requirements for Advanced Multipath in MPLS Networks", Curtis
  Villamizar, Dave McDysan, So Ning, Andrew Malis, Lucy Yong, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-ietf-rtgwg-cl-requirement-11.txt>

      This document provides a set of requirements for Advanced Multipath
      in MPLS Networks.
      
      Advanced Multipath is a formalization of multipath techniques
      currently in use in IP and MPLS networks and a set of extensions to
      existing multipath techniques.

  "An Architecture for IP/LDP Fast-Reroute Using Maximally Redundant
  Trees", Alia Atlas, Robert Kebler, Gabor Envedi, Andras Csaszar, Jeff
  Tantsura, Maciek Konstantynowicz, Russ White, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture-03.txt>

      With increasing deployment of Loop-Free Alternates (LFA) [RFC5286],
      it is clear that a complete solution for IP and LDP Fast-Reroute is
      required.  This specification provides that solution.  IP/LDP Fast-
      Reroute with Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT-FRR) is a technology that
      gives link-protection and node-protection with 100% coverage in any
      network topology that is still connected after the failure.
      
      MRT removes all need to engineer for coverage.  MRT is also extremely
      computationally efficient.  For any router in the network, the MRT
      computation is less than the LFA computation for a node with three or
      more neighbors.

  "Remote LFA FRR", Stewart Bryant, Clarence Filsfils, Stefano Previdi,
  Mike Shand, So Ning, 2013-05-23, <draft-ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa-02.txt>

      This draft describes an extension to the basic IP fast re-route
      mechanism described in RFC5286 that provides additional backup
      connectivity for link failures when none can be provided by the basic
      mechanisms.

      This document provides a set of use cases and design considerations
      for Advanced Multipath.
      
      Advanced Multipath is a formalization of multipath techniques
      currently in use in IP and MPLS networks and a set of extensions to
      existing multipath techniques.

  "Advanced Multipath Framework in MPLS", So Ning, Dave McDysan, Eric
  Osborne, Lucy Yong, Curtis Villamizar, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-rtgwg-cl-framework-04.txt>

      This document specifies a framework for support of Advanced Multipath
      in MPLS networks.  As defined in this framework, an Advanced
      Multipath consists of a group of homogenous or non-homogenous links
      that have the same forward adjacency (FA) and can be considered as a
      single TE link or an IP link when advertised into IGP routing.

  "Multicast only Fast Re-Route", Apoorva Karan, Clarence Filsfils, Dino
  Farinacci, IJsbrand Wijnands, Bruno Decraene, Uwe Joorde, Wim
  Henderickx, 2013-06-21, <draft-ietf-rtgwg-mofrr-02.txt>

      As IPTV deployments grow in number and size, service providers are
      looking for solutions that minimize the service disruption due to
      faults in the IP network carrying the packets for these services.
      This draft describes a mechanism for minimizing packet loss in a
      network when node or link failures occur.  Multicast only Fast Re-
      Route (MoFRR) works by making simple enhancements to multicast
      routing protocols such as PIM and mLDP.

  "Operational management of Loop Free Alternates", Stephane Litkowski,
  Bruno Decraene, Clarence Filsfils, Kamran Raza, 2013-05-13,
  <draft-ietf-rtgwg-lfa-manageability-00.txt>

      Loop Free Alternates (LFA), as defined in RFC 5286 is an IP Fast
      ReRoute (IP FRR) mechanism enabling traffic protection for IP traffic
      (and MPLS LDP traffic by extension).  Following first deployment
      experiences, this document provides operational feedback on LFA,
      highlights some limitations, and proposes a set of refinements to
      address those limitations.  It also proposes required management
      specifications.
      
      This proposal is also applicable to remote LFA solution.

Sip ALerting for User Devices (salud)
-------------------------------------

  "URNs for the Alert-Info Header Field of the Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP)", Laura Liess, Roland Jesske, Alan Johnston, Dale Worley, Paul
  Kyzivat, 2013-07-11, <draft-ietf-salud-alert-info-urns-08.txt>

      The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to
      provide a reference to a specific rendering to be used by the UA when
      the user is alerted.  This is done using the Alert-Info header field.
      However, the reference (typically a URL) addresses only a specific
      network resource with specific rendering properties.  There is
      currently no support for standard identifiers for describing the
      semantics of the alerting situation or the characteristics of the
      alerting signal, without being tied to a particular rendering.  To
      overcome these limitations and support new applications, a new family
      of URNs for use in SIP Alert-Info header fields (and situations with
      similar requirements) is defined in this specification.
      
      This document normatively updates [RFC3261], the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP): It changes the usage of the SIP Alert-Info header
      field defined in the [RFC3261] by additionally allowing its use in
      all provisional responses to INVITE (except the 100 response).

Source Address Validation Improvements (savi)
---------------------------------------------

  "SEND-based Source-Address Validation Implementation", Marcelo Bagnulo,
  Alberto Garcia-Martinez, 2013-04-26, <draft-ietf-savi-send-10.txt>

      This memo describes SEND SAVI, a mechanism to provide source address
      validation using the SEND protocol.  The proposed mechanism is
      intended to complement ingress filtering techniques to provide a
      finer granularity on the control of the source addresses used.

  "SAVI Solution for DHCP", Jun Bi, Jianping Wu, Guang Yao, Fred Baker,
  2013-06-28, <draft-ietf-savi-dhcp-18.txt>

      This document specifies the procedure for creating a binding between
      a DHCPv4/DHCPv6 assigned IP address and a binding anchor on a SAVI
      (Source Address Validation Improvements) device.  The bindings set up
      by this procedure can be used to filter out packets with forged
      source IP address in DHCP scenario.  This mechanism is proposed as a
      complement to ingress filtering to provide finer-grained source IP
      address validation.

  "Source Address Validation Improvement Framework", Jianping Wu, Jun Bi,
  Marcelo Bagnulo, Fred Baker, Christian Vogt, 2012-01-08,
  <draft-ietf-savi-framework-06.txt>

      Source Address Validation Improvement methods were developed to
      prevent nodes attached to the same IP link from spoofing each other's
      IP addresses, so as to complement ingress filtering with finer-
      grained, standardized IP source address validation.  This document is
      a framework document, which describes and motivates the design of the
      SAVI methods.  Particular SAVI methods are described in other
      documents.

  "SAVI for Mixed Address Assignment Methods Scenario", Jun Bi, Guang Yao,
  Joel Halpern, Eric Levy-Abegnoli, 2013-05-06,
  <draft-ietf-savi-mix-04.txt>

      This document reviews how multiple address discovery methods can
      coexist in a single SAVI device and collisions are resolved when the
      same binding entry is discovered by two or more methods.

System for Cross-domain Identity Management (scim)
--------------------------------------------------

  "System for Cross-Domain Identity Management:Protocol", Trey Drake,
  Chuck Mortimore, Morteza Ansari, Kelly Grizzle, Erik Wahlstroem,
  2013-04-15, <draft-ietf-scim-api-01.txt>

      The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
      is designed to make managing user identity in cloud based
      applications and services easier.  The specification suite seeks to
      build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing
      specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while
      applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models.
      It's intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management
      operations by providing a common user schema and extension model, as
      well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this
      schema using standard protocols.  In essence, make it fast, cheap,
      and easy to move users in to, out of, and around the cloud.

      This document provides a platform neutral schema and extension model
      for representing users and groups in JSON format.  This schema is
      intended for exchange and use with cloud service providers.
      Additional binding documents provide a standard REST API, SAML
      binding, and use cases.

Secure Inter-Domain Routing (sidr)
----------------------------------

  "Local Trust Anchor Management for the Resource Public Key
  Infrastructure", Mark Reynolds, Stephen Kent, Matt Lepinski, 2013-04-05,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-ltamgmt-08.txt>

      This document describes a facility to enable a relying party (RP) to
      manage trust anchors (TAs) in the context of the Resource Public Key
      Infrastructure (RPKI). It is common in RP software (not just in the
      RPKI) to allow an RP to import TA material in the form of self-signed
      certificates. However, this approach to incorporating TAs is
      potentially
      dangerous. (These self-signed certificates rarely
      incorporate any
      extensions that impose constraints on the scope of
      the imported public
      keys, and the RP is not able to impose such
      constraints.) The facility
      described in this document allows an RP to
      impose constraints on such
      TAs. Because this mechanism is designed to
      operate in the RPKI context,
      the most important constraints are the
      Internet Number Resources (INRs)
      expressed via RFC 3779 extensions.
      These extentions bind address spaces
      and/or autonomous system (AS)
      numbers to entities. The primary
      motivation for the facility described
      in this document is to enable an
      RP to ensure that INR information
      that it has acquired via some trusted
      channel is not overridden by the
      information acquired from the RPKI
      repository system or by the putative
      TAs that the RP imports.
      Specifically, the mechanism allows an RP to
      specify a set of overriding
      bindings between public key identifiers and
      INR data. These bindings
      take precedence over any conflicting bindings
      acquired by the putative
      TAs and the certificates downloaded from the
      RPKI repository system.
      This mechanism is designed for local use by an RP,
      but any entity that
      is accorded administrative control over a set of RPs
      may use this
      mechanism to convey its view of the RPKI to RPs within its
      jurisdiction.
      The means by which this latter use case is effected is
      outside the scope
      of this document.

  "RPKI-Based Origin Validation Operation", Randy Bush, 2013-02-20,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-origin-ops-20.txt>

      Deployment of RPKI-based BGP origin validation has many operational
      considerations.  This document attempts to collect and present those
      which are most critical.  It is expected to evolve as RPKI-based
      origin validation continues to be deployed and the dynamics are
      better understood.

  "BGPSEC Protocol Specification", Matt Lepinski, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol-07.txt>

      This document describes BGPSEC, an extension to the Border Gateway
      Protocol (BGP) that provides security for the path of autonomous
      systems through which a BGP update message passes.  BGPSEC is
      implemented via a new optional non-transitive BGP path attribute that
      carries a digital signature produced by each autonomous system that
      propagates the update message.

  "An Overview of BGPSEC", Matt Lepinski, Sean Turner, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-overview-03.txt>

      This document provides an overview of a security extension to the
      Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) referred to as BGPSEC.  BGPSEC improves
      security for BGP routing.

  "Threat Model for BGP Path Security", Stephen Kent, Andrew Chi,
  2013-03-26, <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-threats-05.txt>

      This document describes a threat model for the context in which BGP
      path security mechanisms will be developed.  It assumes the context
      established by the SIDR WG charter, as of April 19, 2011.  The
      charter established two goals for the SIDR work:
      
      o  Enabling an AS to verify the authorization of an origin AS to

  "Security Requirements for BGP Path Validation", Steven Bellovin, Randy
  Bush, David Ward, 2013-04-12, <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-reqs-07.txt>

      This document describes requirements for a BGP security protocol
      design to provide cryptographic assurance that the origin AS had the
      right to announce the prefix and to provide assurance of the AS Path
      of the announcement.

  "BGP Algorithms, Key Formats, & Signature Formats", Sean Turner,
  2013-03-26, <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-algs-04.txt>

      This document specifies the algorithms, algorithms' parameters,
      asymmetric key formats, asymmetric key size and signature format used
      in BGPSEC (Border Gateway Protocol Security).  This document updates
      the Profile for Algorithms and Key Sizes for use in the Resource
      Public Key Infrastructure (RFC 6485).

  "A Profile for BGPSEC Router Certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists,
  and Certification Requests", Mark Reynolds, Sean Turner, Stephen Kent,
  2013-04-17, <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles-05.txt>

      This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates for
      the purposes of supporting validation of Autonomous System (AS) paths
      in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), as part of an extension to that
      protocol known as BGPSEC.  BGP is a critical component for the proper
      operation of the Internet as a whole.  The BGPSEC protocol is under
      development as a component to address the requirement to provide
      security for the BGP protocol.  The goal of BGPSEC is to design a
      protocol for full AS path validation based on the use of strong
      cryptographic primitives.  The end-entity (EE) certificates specified
      by this profile are issued under Resource Public Key Infrastructure
      (RPKI) Certification Authority (CA) certificates, containing the AS
      Identifier Delegation extension, to routers within the Autonomous
      System (AS).  The certificate asserts that the router(s) holding the
      private key are authorized to send out secure route advertisements on
      behalf of the specified AS.  This document also profiles the
      Certificate Revocation List (CRL), profiles the format of
      certification requests, and specifies Relying Party certificate path
      validation procedures.  The document extends the RPKI; therefore,
      this documents updates the RPKI Resource Certificates Profile (RFC
      6487).

  "RPKI Router Implementation Report", Randy Bush, Rob Austein, Keyur
  Patel, Hannes Gredler, Matthias Waehlisch, 2013-03-11,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr-impl-03.txt>

      This document is an implementation report for the RPKI Router
      protocol as defined in [RFC6810].  The editor did not verify the
      accuracy of the information provided by respondents.  The respondents
      are experts with the implementations they reported on, and their
      responses are considered authoritative for the implementations for
      which their responses represent.  Respondents were asked to only use
      the YES answer if the feature had at least been tested in the lab.

  "Router Keying for BGPsec", Sean Turner, Keyur Patel, Randy Bush,
  2013-02-23, <draft-ietf-sidr-rtr-keying-01.txt>

      BGPsec-speaking routers must be provisioned with private keys and the
      corresponding public key must be published in the global RPKI
      (Resource Public Key Infrastructure).  This document describes two
      ways of provisioning public/private keys, router-driven and operator-
      driven.

  "Responsible Grandparenting in the RPKI", Randy Bush, 2013-08-03,
  <draft-ymbk-rpki-grandparenting-03.txt>

      There are circumstances in RPKI operation where a resource holder's
      parent may not be able to, or may not choose to, facilitate full and
      proper registration of the holder's data.  As in real life, the
      holder may form a relationship with their grandparent who is willing
      to aid the grandchild.  This document describes simple procedures for
      doing so.

  "Template for a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) for the Resource
  PKI (RPKI)", Karen Seo, 2013-07-29, <draft-ietf-sidr-cps-02.txt>

      This document contains a template to be used for creating a
      Certification Practice Statement (CPS) for an Organization that is
      part of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), e.g., a
      resource allocation registry or an ISP.

  "BGPSEC router key rollover as an alternative to beaconing", Roque
  Gagliano, Keyur Patel, Brian Weis, 2013-04-15,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-rollover-02.txt>

      BGPSEC will need to address the impact from regular and emergency
      rollover processes for the BGPSEC End-Entity (EE) certificates that
      will be performed by Certificate Authorities (CAs) participating at
      the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  This document
      provides general recommendations for that process and specifies how
      this process is used to control BGPSEC's window of exposure to replay
      attacks.

  "Responsible Grandparenting in the RPKI", Randy Bush, 2013-04-10,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-rpki-grandparenting-01.txt>

      There are circumstances in RPKI operation where a resource holder's
      parent may not be able to, or may not choose to, facilitate full and
      proper registration of the holder's data.  As in real life, the
      holder may form a relationship with their grandparent who is willing

  "Policy Qualifiers in RPKI Certificates", Andrew Newton, Geoff Huston,
  2013-05-09, <draft-ietf-sidr-policy-qualifiers-00.txt>

      This document updates RFC 6487 by clarifying the inclusion of policy
      qualifiers in the certificate policies extension of RPKI resource
      certificates.

  "Multiple Repository Publication Points support in the Resource Public
  Key Infrastructure (RPKI)", Roque Gagliano, Terry Manderson, Carlos
  Martinez, 2013-05-22,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-multiple-publication-points-00.txt>

      The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) depends on Relying
      Parties (RP) ability to access its Trust Anchors' certificate
      specified in the different "Trust Anchor Locator (TAL)" files and the
      Repository Objects located at the Certificate Authorities (CA)
      repositories hosted in its respective publication point.  This
      document updates [RFC6490] by allowing multiple URI associated to a
      single public key in a TAL file and introduces the concept of
      multiple repository publication point operators for every CA in the
      RPKI.  This document provides also recommendation for the RP behavior
      when analyzing signed objects that include multiple publications
      points.

  "BGPSec Considerations for AS Migration", Wesley George, Sandra Murphy,
  2013-07-10, <draft-ietf-sidr-as-migration-00.txt>

      This draft discusses considerations and methods for supporting and
      securing a common method for AS-Migration within the BGPSec protocol.

SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (simple)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

  "Multi-party Chat Using the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)", Aki
  Niemi, Miguel Garcia, Geir Sandbakken, 2013-01-13,
  <draft-ietf-simple-chat-18.txt>

      The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) defines a mechanism for
      sending instant messages within a peer-to-peer session, negotiated
      using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Session
      Description Protocol (SDP).  This document defines the necessary
      tools for establishing multi-party chat sessions, or chat rooms,
      using MSRP.

Session Initiation Protocol Core (sipcore)
------------------------------------------

  "An Extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Request
  History Information", Mary Barnes, Francois Audet, Shida Schubert, Hans
  van Elburg, Christer Holmberg, 2013-01-11,
  <draft-ietf-sipcore-rfc4244bis-11.txt>

      This document defines a standard mechanism for capturing the history
      information associated with a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
      request.  This capability enables many enhanced services by providing
      the information as to how and why a SIP request arrives at a specific
      application or user.  This document defines an optional SIP header
      field, History-Info, for capturing the history information in
      requests.  The document also defines SIP header field parameters for
      the History-Info and Contact header fields to tag the method by which
      the target of a request is determined.  In addition, this
      specification defines a value for the Privacy header field that
      directs the anonymization of values in the History-Info header field.
      This document obsoletes RFC 4244.

  "The WebSocket Protocol as a Transport for the Session Initiation
  Protocol (SIP)", Inaki Castillo, Jose Millan, Victor Pascual,
  2013-06-12, <draft-ietf-sipcore-sip-websocket-09.txt>

      The WebSocket protocol enables two-way realtime communication between
      clients and servers in web-based applications.  This document
      specifies a WebSocket sub-protocol as a reliable transport mechanism
      between SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) entities to enable usage of
      SIP in web-oriented deployments.  This document normatively updates
      RFC 3261.

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) History-Info Header Call Flow
  Examples", Mary Barnes, Francois Audet, Shida Schubert, Hans van Elburg,
  Christer Holmberg, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-sipcore-rfc4244bis-callflows-06.txt>

      This document describes use cases and documents call flows which
      require the History-Info header field to capture the Request-URIs as
      a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Request is retargeted.  The use
      cases are described along with the corresponding call flow diagrams
      and messaging details.

SIP Recording (siprec)
----------------------

  "An Architecture for Media Recording using the Session Initiation
  Protocol", Andrew Hutton, Leon Portman, Rajnish Jain, Ken Rehor,
  2013-05-23, <draft-ietf-siprec-architecture-08.txt>

      Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
      environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
      these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
      compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
      is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
      recording device.  This document describes architectures for
      deploying session recording solutions in an environment which is
      based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Recording Metadata", Ram R,
  Parthasarathi Ravindran, Paul Kyzivat, 2013-05-27,
  <draft-ietf-siprec-metadata-12.txt>

      Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
      environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
      these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
      compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
      is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
      recording device.  This document describes the metadata model as
      viewed by Session Recording Server(SRS) and the Recording metadata
      format.

  "Session Recording Protocol", Leon Portman, Henry Lum, Charles Eckel,
  Alan Johnston, Andrew Hutton, 2013-05-17,
  <draft-ietf-siprec-protocol-10.txt>

      This document specifies the use of the Session Initiation Protocol
      (SIP), the Session Description Protocol (SDP), and the Real Time
      Protocol (RTP) for delivering real-time media and metadata from a
      Communication Session (CS) to a recording device.  The Session
      Recording Protocol specifies the use of SIP, SDP, and RTP to
      establish a Recording Session (RS) between the Session Recording
      Client (SRC), which is on the path of the CS, and a Session Recording
      Server (SRS) at the recording device.

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Recording Call Flows", Ram R,
  Parthasarathi Ravindran, Paul Kyzivat, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-ietf-siprec-callflows-01.txt>

      Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
      environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
      these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
      compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
      is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
      recording device.  This document lists call flows that has snapshot
      of metadata sent from SRC to SRS, the metadata format for which is
      described in [I-D.ietf-siprec-metadata] .  This is purely an
      informational document that is written to support the model defined
      in the metadata draft.

SIP Overload Control (soc)
--------------------------

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control", Vijay Gurbani,
  Volker Hilt, Henning Schulzrinne, 2013-05-23,
  <draft-ietf-soc-overload-control-13.txt>

      Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when
      SIP servers have insufficient resources to handle all SIP messages
      they receive.  Even though the SIP protocol provides a limited
      overload control mechanism through its 503 (Service Unavailable)
      response code, SIP servers are still vulnerable to overload.  This
      document defines the behaviour of SIP servers involved in overload
      control, and in addition, it specifies a loss-based overload scheme
      for SIP.

  "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Load Control Event Package",
  Charles Shen, Henning Schulzrinne, Arata Koike, 2013-07-30,
  <draft-ietf-soc-load-control-event-package-09.txt>

      We define a load control event package for the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP).  It allows SIP entities to distribute load filtering
      policies to other SIP entities in the network.  The load filtering
      policies contain rules to throttle calls based on their source or
      destination domain, telephone number prefix or for a specific user.
      The mechanism helps to prevent signaling overload and complements
      feedback-based SIP overload control efforts.

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Rate Control", Eric Noel, Philip
  Williams, 2013-04-08, <draft-ietf-soc-overload-rate-control-04.txt>

      The prevalent use of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] in
      Next Generation Networks necessitates that SIP networks provide
      adequate control mechanisms to maintain transaction throughput by
      preventing congestion collapse during traffic overloads. Already
      [draft-ietf-soc-overload-control-12] proposes a loss-based solution
      to remedy known vulnerabilities of the [RFC3261] SIP 503 (service
      unavailable) overload control mechanism. This document proposes a
      rate-based control solution to complement the loss-based control
      defined in [draft-ietf-soc-overload-control-12].

Softwires (softwire)
--------------------

  "Definitions of Managed Objects for 6rd", Lei Cai, Jacni Qin, Shishio
  Tsuchiya, 2013-05-16, <draft-cai-softwire-6rd-mib-05.txt>

      This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
      (MIB) for use with network management protocols.  In particular, it
      defines objects for managing 6rd devices.

  "Public IPv4 over IPv6 Access Network", Yong Cui, Jianping Wu, Peng Wu,
  Olivier Vautrin, Yiu Lee, 2013-07-28,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-public-4over6-10.txt>

      This document describes a mechanism called Public 4over6 which is
      designed to provide IPv4 Internet connectivity over an IPv6 access
      network using global IPv4 addresses.  Public 4over6 was developed in
      the IETF and is in use in some existing deployments, but is not
      recommended for new deployments.  Future deployments of similar
      scenarios should use Lightweight 4over6.  Public 4over6 follows the
      Hub and Spoke softwire model, and uses an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel to
      forward IPv4 packets over IPv6 access network.  The bi-directionality
      of the IPv4 communication is achieved by explicitly allocating global
      non-shared IPv4 addresses to end users, as well as maintaining IPv4-
      IPv6 address binding on the border relay.  Public 4over6 aims to
      provide uninterrupted IPv4 services to users, like Internet Content
      Providers, etc., while an operator makes the transition of the access
      network to an IPv6-only access network.

  "Motivations for Carrier-side Stateless IPv4 over IPv6 Migration
  Solutions", Mohamed Boucadair, Satoru Matsushima, Yiu Lee, Olaf Bonness,
  Isabel Borges, Gang Chen, 2012-11-13,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation-05.txt>

      IPv4 service continuity is one of the most pressing problems that
      must be resolved by Service Providers during the IPv6 transition
      period - especially after the exhaustion of the public IPv4 address
      space.  Current standardization effort that addresses IPv4 service
      continuity focuses on stateful mechanisms.  This document elaborates
      on the motivations for the need to undertake a companion effort to
      specify stateless IPv4 over IPv6 approaches.

  "Delivery of IPv4 Multicast Services to IPv4 Clients over an IPv6
  Multicast Network", Jacni Qin, Mohamed Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet,
  Yiu Lee, Qian Wang, 2013-04-14,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast-05.txt>

      This document specifies a solution for the delivery of IPv4 multicast
      services to IPv4 clients over an IPv6 multicast network.  The
      solution relies upon a stateless IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation scheme
      and uses the IPv6 multicast distribution tree to deliver IPv4
      multicast traffic.  The solution is particularly useful for the
      delivery of multicast service offerings to DS-Lite serviced
      customers.

  Chris Metz, Greg Shepherd, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-mesh-multicast-05.txt,.pdf>

      The Internet needs to support IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  Both address
      families and their attendant protocol suites support multicast of the
      single-source and any-source varieties.  As part of the transition to
      IPv6, there will be scenarios where a backbone network running one IP
      address family internally (referred to as internal IP or I-IP) will
      provide transit services to attached client networks running another
      IP address family (referred to as external IP or E-IP).  It is
      expected that the I-IP backbone will offer unicast and multicast
      transit services to the client E-IP networks.
      
      Softwire Mesh is a solution to E-IP unicast and multicast support
      across an I-IP backbone.  This document describes the mechanisms for
      supporting Internet-style multicast across a set of E-IP and I-IP
      networks supporting softwire mesh.

  "RADIUS Attribute for MAP", Sheng Jiang, Yu Fu, Bing Liu, Peter Deacon,
  2013-04-26, <draft-jiang-softwire-map-radius-04.txt>

      Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) is a stateless mechanism for
      running IPv4 over IPv6-only infrastructure. It provides both IPv4 and
      IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-
      existing period. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
      (DHCPv6) MAP options has been defined to configure MAP Customer Edge
      (CE). However, in many networks, the configuration information may be
      stored in Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers
      while user configuration is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway
      (BNG) through DHCPv6 protocol. This document defines a Remote
      Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries
      MAP configuration information from AAA server to BNG. The MAP RADIUS
      attribute are designed following the simplify principle. It provides
      just enough information to form the correspondent DHCPv6 MAP option.

  Despres, Sheng Jiang, Reinaldo Penno, Yiu Lee, Gang Chen, Maoke Chen,
  2013-07-11, <draft-ietf-softwire-4rd-06.txt>

      The 4rd automatic tunneling mechanism makes IPv4 Residual Deployment
      possible via IPv6 networks without maintaining for this per-customer
      states in 4rd-capable nodes (reverse of the IPv6 Rapid Deployment of
      6rd).  To cope with the IPv4 address shortage, customer sites can be
      assigned shared public IPv4 addresses with restricted port sets. 4rd
      can also support the scenarios that customer sites are assigned full
      public IPv4 addresses or a set of public IPv4 addresses.

  Simon Perreault, Senthil Sivakumar, 2013-05-30,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-unified-cpe-01.txt>

      Transporting IPv4 packets encapsulated in IPv6 is a common solution
      to the problem of IPv4 service continuity over IPv6-only provider
      networks.  A number of differing functional approaches have been
      developed for this, each having their own specific characteristics.
      As these approaches share a similar functional architecture and use
      the same data plane mechanisms, this memo describes a specification
      whereby a single CPE can interwork with all of the standardized and
      proposed approaches to providing encapsulated IPv4 in IPv6 services.

  Cui, Qiong Sun, Mohamed Boucadair, Tina Tsou, Yiu Lee, Ian Farrer,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-softwire-lw4over6-01.txt>

      DS-Lite [RFC6333] describes an architecture for transporting IPv4
      packets over an IPv6 network.  This document specifies an extension
      to DS-Lite called Lightweight 4over6 which moves the Network Address
      Translation function from the DS-Lite AFTR to the B4, removing the
      requirement for a Carrier Grade NAT function in the AFTR.  This
      reduces the amount of centralized state that must be held to a per-
      subscriber level.  In order to delegate the NAPT function and make
      IPv4 Address sharing possible, port-restricted IPv4 addresses are
      allocated to the B4s.

  "Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email,
  Version 1", D. Kitterman, 2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-spfbis-4408bis-17.txt>

      Email on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways.  In
      particular, existing protocols place no restriction on what a sending
      host can use as the "MAIL FROM" of a message or the domain given on
      the SMTP HELO/EHLO commands.  This document describes version 1 of
      the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol, whereby ADministrative
      Management Domains (ADMDs) can explicitly authorize the hosts that
      are allowed to use its domain names, and a receiving host can check
      such authorization.

  "iSCSI Extensions for RDMA Specification", Mike Ko, Alexander Nezhinsky,
  2013-07-09, <draft-ietf-storm-iser-15.txt>

      iSCSI Extensions for Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) provides the
      RDMA data transfer capability to iSCSI by layering iSCSI on top of
      an RDMA-Capable Protocol.  An RDMA-Capable Protocol provides RDMA
      Read and Write services, which enable data to be transferred
      directly into SCSI I/O Buffers without intermediate data copies.
      This document describes the extensions to the iSCSI protocol to
      support RDMA services as provided by an RDMA-Capable Protocol.
      
      This document obsoletes RFC 5046.

  "Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) SCSI Features
  Update", Frederick Knight, Mallikarjun Chadalapaka, 2013-07-30,
  <draft-ietf-storm-iscsi-sam-08.txt,.pdf>

      Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) is a SCSI
      transport protocol that maps the SCSI family of protocols onto
      TCP/IP. The iSCSI protocol as specified in RFCxxx (and as
      previously specified by the combination of RFC 3720 and RFC
      5048) is based on the SAM-2 (SCSI Architecture Model - 2)
      version of the SCSI family of protocols. This document
      defines enhancements to the iSCSI protocol to support certain
      additional features of the SCSI protocol that were defined in
      SAM-3, SAM-4, and SAM-5.
      
      This document is a companion document to RFCxxx.

  <draft-ietf-storm-iscsi-cons-10.txt,.pdf>

      This document describes a transport protocol for SCSI that works
      on top of TCP. The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with
      the standardized SCSI Architecture Model (SAM-2). RFC 3720
      defined the original iSCSI protocol. RFC 3721 discusses iSCSI
      Naming examples and discovery techniques. Subsequently, RFC 3980
      added an additional naming format to iSCSI protocol. RFC 4850
      followed up by adding a new public extension key to iSCSI. RFC
      5048 offered a number of clarifications and a few improvements and
      corrections to the original iSCSI protocol.
      
      
      This document obsoletes RFCs 3720, 3980, 4850 and 5048 by
      consolidating them into a single document and making additional
      updates to the consolidated specification. This document also
      updates RFC 3721. The text in this document thus supersedes the
      text in all the noted RFCs wherever there is a difference in
      semantics.

  "A Taxonomy of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Back-to-Back User
  Agents", Hadriel Kaplan, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-straw-b2bua-taxonomy-02.txt>

      In many SIP deployments, SIP entities exist in the SIP signaling path
      between the originating UAC and final terminating UAS, which go
      beyond the definition of a Proxy, performing functions not defined in
      standards-track RFCs.  The only term for such devices provided in
      [RFC3261] is for a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), which is defined
      as the logical concatenation of a User Agent Server (UAS) and User
      Agent Client (UAC).
      
      There are numerous types of SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs),
      performing different roles in different ways.  For Example IP-PBXs,
      SBCs and Application Servers.  This document identifies several
      common B2BUA roles, in order to provide taxonomy other documents can
      use and reference.

  "Loop Detection Mechanisms for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
  Back-to- Back User Agents (B2BUAs)", Hadriel Kaplan, Victor Pascual,
  2013-08-05, <draft-ietf-straw-b2bua-loop-detection-01.txt>

      SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) can cause unending SIP request
      routing loops because, as User Agent Clients, they can generate SIP
      requests with new Max-Forwards values.  This document discusses the
      difficulties associated with loop detection for B2BUAs, and
      requirements for them to prevent infinite loops.

  "A Media-based Traceroute Function for the Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP)", Hadriel Kaplan, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-straw-sip-traceroute-00.txt>

      SIP already provides the ability to perform hop-by-hop traceroute
      for SIP messages using the Max-Forwards header field, in order to
      determine the reachability path of requests to a target.  A
      mechanism for media-loopback calls has also been defined separately,
      which enables test calls to be generated which result in media being
      looped back to the originator.  This document describes a means of
      performing hop-by-hop traceroute-style test calls using the media-
      loopback mechanism, in order to test the media path when SIP
      sessions go through media-relaying B2BUAs.

  "TCP Extensions for High Performance", David Borman, Robert Braden, Van
  Jacobson, Richard Scheffenegger, 2013-08-06,

      This document specifies a set of TCP extensions to improve
      performance over paths with a large bandwidth * delay product and to
      provide reliable operation over very high-speed paths.  It defines
      TCP options for scaled windows and timestamps.  The timestamps are
      used for two distinct mechanisms, RTTM (Round Trip Time Measurement)
      and PAWS (Protection Against Wrapped Sequences).
      
      This document obsoletes RFC 1323 and describes changes from it.

  "TCP Fast Open", Yuchung Cheng, Jerry Chu, Arvind Jain, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-tcpm-fastopen-04.txt>

      TCP Fast Open (TFO) allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK
      packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial
      connection handshake, thus saving up to one full round trip time
      (RTT) compared to the standard TCP, which requires a three-way
      handshake (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged. However
      TFO deviates from the standard TCP semantics in that the data in the
      SYN could be replayed to an application in some rare circumstances.
      Applications should not use TFO unless they can tolerate this issue,
      which is detailed in the Applicability section.
      
      Terminology

  "Problem Statement and Requirements for a More Accurate ECN Feedback",
  Mirja Kuehlewind, Richard Scheffenegger, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-tcpm-accecn-reqs-03.txt>

      Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an IP/TCP mechanism where
      network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to
      indicate congestion to the end-points.  An ECN-capable receiver will
      feedback this information to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP in
      such a way that only one feedback signal can be transmitted per
      Round-Trip Time (RTT).  Recently, new TCP mechanisms like ConEx or
      DCTCP need more accurate ECN feedback information in the case where
      more than one marking is received in one RTT.  This documents
      specifies requirement for different ECN feedback scheme in the TCP
      header to provide more than one feedback signal per RTT.

  "Updating TCP to support Rate-Limited Traffic", Gorry Fairhurst, Arjuna
  Sathiaseelan, Raffaello Secchi, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-ietf-tcpm-newcwv-02.txt>

      This document proposes an update to RFC 5681 to address issues that
      arise when TCP is used to support traffic that exhibits periods where
      the sending rate is limited by the application rather than the
      congestion window.  It updates TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart
      quickly following either an idle or rate-limited interval.  This
      method is expected to benefit applications that send rate-limited
      traffic using TCP, while also providing an appropriate response if
      congestion is experienced.
      
      It also evaluates the Experimental specification of TCP Congestion
      Window Validation, CWV, defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that RFC
      2861 sought to address important issues, but failed to deliver a
      widely used solution.  This document therefore recommends that the
      status of RFC 2861 is moved from Experimental to Historic, and that
      it is replaced by the current specification.
      
      NOTE: The standards status of this WG document is under review for
      consideration as either Experimental (EXP) or Proposed Standard (PS).
      This decision will be made later as the document is finalised.

  "TCP and SCTP RTO Restart", Per Hurtig, Anna Brunstrom, Andreas Petlund,
  Michael Welzl, 2013-02-18, <draft-ietf-tcpm-rtorestart-00.txt>

      This document describes a modified algorithm for managing the TCP and
      SCTP retransmission timers that provides faster loss recovery when a
      connection's amount of outstanding data is small.  The modification
      allows the transport to restart its retransmission timer more
      aggressively in situations where fast retransmit cannot be used.
      This enables faster loss detection and recovery for connections that
      are short-lived or application-limited.

      This document contains a "roadmap" to the Requests for Comments (RFC)
      documents relating to the Internet's Transmission Control Protocol
      (TCP).  This roadmap provides a brief summary of the documents
      defining TCP and various TCP extensions that have accumulated in the
      RFC series.  This serves as a guide and quick reference for both TCP
      implementers and other parties who desire information contained in
      the TCP-related RFCs.

Timing over IP Connection and Transfer of Clock (tictoc)
--------------------------------------------------------

  "Transporting Timing messages over MPLS Networks", Shahram Davari, Amit
  Oren, Manav Bhatia, Peter Roberts, Laurent Montini, 2013-06-14,
  <draft-ietf-tictoc-1588overmpls-05.txt>

      This document defines the method for transporting Timing messages
      such as PTP and NTP over an MPLS network.  The method allows for the
      easy identification of these PDUs at the port level to allow for port
      level processing of these PDUs in both LERs and LSRs.
      
      The basic idea is to transport Timing messages inside dedicated MPLS
      LSPs.  These LSPs only carry Timing messages and possibly Control and
      Management packets, but they do not carry customer traffic.
      
      Two methods for transporting Timing messages over MPLS are defined.
      The first method is to transport Timing messages directly over the
      dedicated MPLS LSP via UDP/IP encapsulation, which is suitable for
      MPLS networks.  The second method is to transport Timing messages
      inside a PW via Ethernet encapsulation.

  "Precision Time Protocol Version 2 (PTPv2) Management Information Base",
  Vinay Shankarkumar, Laurent Montini, Tim Frost, Greg Dowd, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-tictoc-ptp-mib-05.txt,.pdf>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
      In particular, it defines objects for managing networks using
      Precision Time Protocol, specified in [IEEE 1588-2008].
      
      This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant
      to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
      definitions.

  "Security Requirements of Time Protocols in Packet Switched Networks",
  Tal Mizrahi, 2013-04-25,
  <draft-ietf-tictoc-security-requirements-05.txt>

      As time and frequency distribution protocols are becoming
      increasingly common and widely deployed, concern about their exposure
      to various security threats is increasing. This document defines a
      set of security requirements for time protocols, focusing on the
      Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
      This document also discusses the security impacts of time protocol
      practices, the performance implications of external security
      practices on time protocols and the dependencies between other
      security services and time synchronization.

  "Enterprise Profile for the Precision Time Protocol With Mixed Multicast
  and Unicast Messages", Doug Arnold, Heiko Gerstung, 2013-07-07,
  <draft-ietf-tictoc-ptp-enterprise-profile-00.txt>

      This document describes a profile for the use of the Precision
      Time Protocol in an IPV4 or IPv6 Enterprise information system
      environment.  The profile uses the End to End Delay Measurement
      Mechanism, allows both multicast and unicast Delay Request and Delay
      Response Messages.

Transport Layer Security (tls)
------------------------------

  "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Cached Information Extension", Stefan
  Santesson, Hannes Tschofenig, 2013-03-28,
  <draft-ietf-tls-cached-info-14.txt>

      Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshakes often include fairly static
      information, such as the server certificate and a list of trusted
      Certification Authorities (CAs).  This information can be of
      considerable size, particularly if the server certificate is bundled
      with a complete certificate path (including all intermediary
      certificates up to the trust anchor public key).
      
      This document defines an extension that omits the exchange of already
      available information.  The TLS client informs a server of cached
      information, for example from a previous TLS handshake, allowing the
      server to omit the already available information.

  "Out-of-Band Public Key Validation for Transport Layer Security (TLS)",
  Paul Wouters, Hannes Tschofenig, John Gilmore, Samuel Weiler, Tero
  Kivinen, 2013-07-30, <draft-ietf-tls-oob-pubkey-09.txt>

      This document specifies a new certificate type and two TLS
      extensions, one for the client and one for the server, for exchanging
      raw public keys in Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram
      Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for use with out-of-band public key
      validation.

  "Secure Password Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)", Dan
  Harkins, Dave Halasz, 2013-02-15, <draft-ietf-tls-pwd-00.txt>

      This memo defines several new ciphersuites for the Transport Layer
      Security (TLS) protocol to support certificate-less, secure
      authentication using only a simple, low-entropy, password.  The
      ciphersuites are all based on an authentication and key exchange
      protocol that is resistant to off-line dictionary attack.

  "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Application Layer Protocol Negotiation
  Extension", Stephan Friedl, Andrey Popov, Adam Langley, Stephan Emile,
  2013-04-25, <draft-ietf-tls-applayerprotoneg-01.txt>

      This document describes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension
      for application layer protocol negotiation within the TLS handshake.
      For instances in which the TLS connection is established over a well
      known TCP/IP port not associated with the desired application layer
      protocol, this extension allows the application layer to negotiate
      which protocol will be used within the TLS session.

Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (trill)
----------------------------------------------------

  "TRILL: Campus Label and Priority Regions", Radia Perlman, Anil
  Rijhsinghani, Donald Eastlake, Ayan Banerjee, Dinesh Dutt, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-vlan-mapping-09.txt>

      Within a TRILL campus, the data label (VLAN or Fine Grained Label)
      and priority of TRILL encapsulated frames is preserved. However, in
      some cases it may be desired that data label and/or priority be
      mapped at the boundary between regions of such a campus. This
      document describes an optional TRILL switch feature to provide this
      function.

  "TRILL: RBridge Channel Support", Donald Eastlake, Vishwas Manral, Li
  Yizhou, Sam Aldrin, David Ward, 2012-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-channel-08.txt>

      This document specifies a general channel mechanism for sending
      messages, such as BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) messages,
      between RBridges (Routing Bridges) and between RBridges and end
      stations in an RBridge campus through extensions to the TRILL
      (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol.

  "TRILL (Transparent Interconnetion of Lots of Links): Bidirectional
  Forwarding Detection (BFD) Support", Vishwas Manral, Donald Eastlake,
  David Ward, Ayan Banerjee, 2012-07-16,
  <draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-bfd-07.txt>

      This document specifies use of the BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding
      Detection) protocol in RBridge campuses based on the Rbridge Channel
      extension to the the TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of
      Links) protocol.
      
      BFD is a widely deployed OAM (Operations, Administration, and
      Maintenance) mechanism in IP and MPLS (Multi Protocol Label
      Switching) networks, using UDP and ACH (Associated Channel Header)
      encapsulation respectively.  This document specifies the BFD
      encapsulation over TRILL.

  "TRILL: Header Extension", Donald Eastlake, Anoop Ghanwani, Vishwas
  Manral, Li Yizhou, Caitlin Bestler, 2012-06-20,
  <draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-extension-05.txt>

      The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) base
      protocol specifies minimal hooks to safely support TRILL Header
      extensions. This document specifies an initial extension providing
      additional flag bits and specifies some of those bits. It updates RFC
      6325.

  "TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links): Fine-Grained
  Labeling", Donald Eastlake, Mingui Zhang, Puneet Agarwal, Radia Perlman,
  Dinesh Dutt, 2013-05-17, <draft-ietf-trill-fine-labeling-07.txt>

      The IETF has standardized TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots
      of Links), a protocol for least cost transparent frame routing in
      multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and link technologies,
      using link-state routing and a hop count. The TRILL base protocol
      standard supports labeling of TRILL data with up to 4K IDs. However,
      there are applications that require a larger number of labels
      providing configurable isolation of data. This document updates RFC
      6325 by specifying optional extensions to the TRILL base protocol to
      safely accomplish this. These extensions, called fine grained
      labeling, are primarily intended for use in large Data Centers, those
      with >4K users requiring configurable data isolation from each other.

  "TRILL: Clarifications, Corrections, and Updates", Donald Eastlake,
  Mingui Zhang, Anoop Ghanwani, Vishwas Manral, Ayan Banerjee, 2012-07-30,
  <draft-ietf-trill-clear-correct-06.txt>

      The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
      protocol provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without
      configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology and link
      technology, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops,
      and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic.
      TRILL accomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate System to
      Intermediate System) link state routing and by encapsulating traffic
      using a header that includes a hop count. Since the TRILL base
      protocol was approved in March 2010, active development of TRILL has
      revealed errata in the original RFC 6325 and some cases that could
      use clarifications or updates.
      
      RFC 6327 and RFC 6439 provide clarifications and updates with respect
      to Adjacency and Appointed Forwarders. This document provides other
      known clarifications, corrections, and updates to RFC 6325, RFC 6327,
      and RFC 6439.

  "TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links): ESADI (End
  Station Address Distribution Information) Protocol", ZTE Corporation,
  fangwei hu, Radia Perlman, Donald Eastlake, Olen Stokes, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-trill-esadi-03.txt>

      The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
      protocol provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without
      configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and
      link technologies.  TRILL supports multi-pathing of both unicast and
      multicast traffic.  Devices that implement the TRILL protocol are
      called TRILL Switches or RBridges (Routing Bridges).
      
      ESADI (End Station Address Distribution Information) is an optional
      protocol by which a TRILL switch can communicate, in a Data Label
      (VLAN or Fine Grained Label) scoped way, end station addresses and
      other information to TRILL switches participating in ESADI for the
      relevant Data Label.  This document updates RFC 6325, specifically
      the documentation of the ESADI protocol.

  "TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links): Edge Directory
  Assistance Framework", Linda Dunbar, Donald Eastlake, Radia Perlman,
  Igor Gashinsky, 2013-08-11,
  <draft-ietf-trill-directory-framework-07.txt>

      Edge TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) switches
      currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses and their egress
      TRILL switch by observing the data packets they ingress or egress or
      by the TRILL ESADI (End Station Address Distribution Information)
      protocol. When an ingress TRILL switch receives a data frame whose
      destination address (MAC&Label) that switch does not know, the data
      frame is flooded within the frame's Data Label across the TRILL
      campus.
      
      This document describes the framework for using directory services to
      assist edge TRILL switches in reducing multi-destination frames,
      particularly unknown unicast frames flooding, and ARP/ND, thus
      improving TRILL network scalability and security.

  "TRILL OAM Framework", Samer Salam, Tissa Senevirathne, Sam Aldrin,
  Donald Eastlake, 2013-05-23, <draft-ietf-trill-oam-framework-02.txt>

      This document specifies a reference framework for Operations,
      Administration and Maintenance (OAM) in TRILL networks. The focus of
      the document is on the fault and performance management aspects of
      TRILL OAM.

  "TRILL: Adjacency", Donald Eastlake, Radia Perlman, Anoop Ghanwani,
  Howard Yang, Vishwas Manral, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-trill-rfc6327bis-01.txt>

      The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
      protocol supports arbitrary link technologies between TRILL switches
      including point-to-point links and multi-access LAN (Local Area
      Network) links that can have multiple TRILL switches and end stations
      attached. TRILL uses IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate
      System) routing. This document specifies the establishment,
      reporting, and termination of IS-IS adjacency between TRILL switches,
      also known as RBridges. It also concerns four other link-local
      aspects of TRILL: Designated RBridge (DRB) selection, MTU (Maximum
      Transmission Unit) testing, pseudonode creation, and BFD (Bi-
      Directional Forwarding Detection) session bootstrapping in connection
      with adjacency. State diagrams are included where appropriate.  This
      document obsoletes RFC 6327 and updates RFC 6325.

  "TRILL Fault Management", Tissa Senevirathne, Norman Finn, Samer Salam,
  Deepak Kumar, Donald Eastlake, Sam Aldrin, Li Yizhou, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-ietf-trill-oam-fm-00.txt>

      This document specifies TRILL OAM Fault Management. Methods in
      this document follow the IEEE 802.1 CFM framework and reuse OAM
      tools where possible. Additional messages and TLVs are defined
      for TRILL specific applications or where a different set of
      information is required other than IEEE 802.1 CFM.

Transport Area Working Group (tsvwg)
------------------------------------

  "Byte and Packet Congestion Notification", Bob Briscoe, Jukka Manner,
  2013-08-01, <draft-ietf-tsvwg-byte-pkt-congest-11.txt>

      This document provides recommendations of best current practice for
      dropping or marking packets using any active queue management (AQM)
      algorithm, including random early detection (RED), BLUE, pre-
      congestion notification (PCN) and newer schemes such as CoDel and
      PIE.  We give three strong recommendations: (1) packet size should be
      taken into account when transports detect and respond to congestion
      indications, (2) packet size should not be taken into account when
      network equipment creates congestion signals (marking, dropping), and
      therefore (3) in the specific case of RED, the byte-mode packet drop
      variant that drops fewer small packets should not be used.  This memo
      updates RFC 2309 to deprecate deliberate preferential treatment of
      small packets in AQM algorithms.

  "Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Network Address Translation
  Support", Randall Stewart, Michael Tuexen, Irene Ruengeler, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-natsupp-05.txt>

      Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable
      communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to
      TCP [RFC0793].  With the widespread deployment of Network Address
      Translators (NAT), specialized code has been added to NAT for TCP
      that allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT and yet use only a
      single globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts (behind a
      NAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection.  This
      additional code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port
      Translation (NAPT).  To date, specialized code for SCTP has not yet
      been added to most NATs so that only pure NAT is available.  The end
      result of this is that only one SCTP capable host can be behind a
      NAT.
      
      This document describes the protocol extensions required for the SCTP
      endpoints to help NATs provide similar features of NAPT in the
      single-point and multi-point traversal scenario.

  "Integrated Services (IntServ) Extension to Allow Signaling of Multiple
  Traffic Specifications and Multiple Flow Specifications in RSVPv1",
  James Polk, Subha Dhesikan, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-intserv-multiple-tspec-02.txt>

      This document defines extensions to Integrated Services (IntServ)
      allowing  multiple traffic specifications and multiple flow
      specifications to be conveyed in the same Resource Reservation
      Protocol (RSVPv1) reservation message exchange. This ability helps
      optimize an agreeable bandwidth through a network between endpoints
      in a single round trip.

  "Generic Aggregation of Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) for IPv4
  And IPv6 Reservations over PCN domains", Georgios Karagiannis, Anurag
  Bhargava, 2013-07-29, <draft-ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-pcn-06.txt>

      This document specifies extensions to Generic Aggregated RSVP
      [RFC4860] for support of the PCN Controlled Load (CL) and Single
      Marking (SM) edge behaviors over a Diffserv cloud using Pre-
      Congestion Notification.

  "Recommendations for Transport Port Uses", Joseph Touch, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-port-use-02.txt>

      This document provides recommendations to application and service
      designers on how to use the transport protocol port number space to
      help in its preservation.

  "Quick Failover Algorithm in SCTP", Yoshifumi Nishida, Preethi
  Natarajan, Armando Caro, Paul Amer, 2013-06-18,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-failover-01.txt>

      One of the major advantages in SCTP is supporting multi-homing
      communication.  If a multi-homed end-point has redundant network
      connections, SCTP sessions can have a good chance to survive from
      network failures by migrating inactive network to active one.
      However, if we follow the SCTP standard, there can be significant
      delay for the network migration.  During this migration period, SCTP
      cannot transmit much data to the destination.  This issue drastically
      impairs the usability of SCTP in some situations.  This memo
      describes the issue of SCTP failover mechanism and discuss its
      solutions which require minimal modification to the current standard.

  "DTLS Encapsulation of SCTP Packets", Randell Jesup, Salvatore Loreto,
  Randall Stewart, Michael Tuexen, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps-01.txt>

      The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport
      protocol originally defined to run on top of the network protocols
      IPv4 or IPv6.  This document specifies how SCTP can be used on top of
      the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol.

  "SACK-IMMEDIATELY Extension for the Stream Control Transmission
  Protocol", Michael Tuexen, Irene Ruengeler, Randall Stewart, 2013-04-08,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-sack-immediately-03.txt>

      This document updates RFC 4960 by defining a method for the sender of
      a DATA chunk to indicate that the corresponding SACK chunk should be
      sent back immediately and not be delayed.  It is done by specifying a
      bit in the DATA chunk header, called the I-bit, which can get set
      either by the SCTP implementation or by the application using an SCTP
      stack.  Since unknown flags in chunk headers are ignored by SCTP
      implementations, this extension does not introduce any
      interoperability problems.

  "Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Application-ID Profiles for Voice
  and Video Streams", James Polk, Subha Dhesikan, 2013-02-19,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-app-id-vv-profiles-00.txt>

      RFC 2872 defines an Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) object for
      application identifiers.  This document uses that App-ID and gives
      implementers specific guidelines for differing voice and video
      stream identifications to nodes along a reservation path, creating
      specific profiles for voice and video session identification.

Uniform Resource Names, Revised (urnbis)
----------------------------------------

  "Uniform Resource Name (URN) Syntax", Peter Saint-Andre, 2013-08-02,
  <draft-ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn-06.txt>

      A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
      that is intended to serve as a persistent, location-independent
      resource identifier.  This document defines the canonical syntax for
      URIs under the "urn" scheme, guidelines for URN namespaces,
      requirements for URN presentation and transmission, and methods for
      determining URN equivalence.  This document obsoletes RFC 2141.

  "Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace Definition Mechanisms", Peter
  Saint-Andre, Leslie Daigle, Dirk-Willem van Gulik, Renato Iannella,
  Patrick Faltstrom, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-ietf-urnbis-rfc3406bis-urn-ns-reg-06.txt>

      This document supplements the Uniform Resource Name (URN) syntax
      specification by defining the concept of a URN namespace, as well as
      mechanisms for defining and registering such namespaces.  This
      document obsoletes RFC 3406.

IPv6 Operations (v6ops)
-----------------------

  "IPv6 Multihoming without Network Address Translation", Ole Troan, David
  Miles, Satoru Matsushima, Tadahisa Okimoto, Dan Wing, 2013-03-18,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv6-multihoming-without-ipv6nat-05.txt>

      Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) works well for conserving
      global addresses and addressing multihoming requirements, because an
      IPv4 NAPT router implements three functions: source address
      selection, next-hop resolution and optionally DNS resolution.  For
      IPv6 hosts one approach could be the use of NPTv6.  However, NAT
      should be avoided, if at all possible, to permit transparent end-to-
      end connectivity.  In this document, we analyze the use cases of
      multihoming.  We also describe functional requirements and possible
      solutions for multihoming without the use of NAT in IPv6 for hosts
      and small IPv6 networks that would otherwise be unable to meet
      minimum IPv6 allocation criteria.  We conclude that DHCPv6 based
      solutions are suitable to solve the multihoming issues, described in
      this document, while NPTv6 may be required as an intermediate
      solution.

  "Basic Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers", Hemant Singh, Wes
  Beebee, Chris Donley, Barbara Stark, 2012-10-30,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-6204bis-12.txt>

      This document specifies requirements for an IPv6 Customer Edge (CE)
      router.  Specifically, the current version of this document focuses
      on the basic provisioning of an IPv6 CE router and the provisioning
      of IPv6 hosts attached to it.  The document also covers IP transition
      technologies.  Two transition technologies in RFC 5969's 6rd and RFC
      6333's DS-Lite are covered in the document.  The document obsoletes
      RFC 6204, if approved.

  "Implementation Advice for IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard)",
  Fernando Gont, 2012-11-14,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-ra-guard-implementation-07.txt>

      The IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) mechanism is commonly
      employed to mitigate attack vectors based on forged ICMPv6 Router
      Advertisement messages.  Many existing IPv6 deployments rely on RA-
      Guard as the first line of defense against the aforementioned attack
      vectors.  However, some implementations of RA-Guard have been found
      to be prone to circumvention by employing IPv6 Extension Headers.
      This document describes the evasion techniques that affect the
      aforementioned implementations, and formally updates RFC 6105, such
      that the aforementioned RA-Guard evasion vectors are eliminated.

  "Enterprise IPv6 Deployment Guidelines", KK Chittimaneni, Tim Chown, Lee
  Howard, Victor Kuarsingh, Yanick Pouffary, Eric Vyncke, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-enterprise-incremental-ipv6-03.txt>

      Enterprise network administrators worldwide are in various stages of
      preparing for or deploying IPv6 into their networks.  The
      administrators face different challenges than operators of Internet
      access providers, and have reasons for different priorities.  The
      overall problem for many administrators will be to offer Internet-
      facing services over IPv6, while continuing to support IPv4, and
      while introducing IPv6 access within the enterprise IT network.  The
      overall transition will take most networks from an IPv4-only
      environment to a dual stack network environment and potentially an
      IPv6-only operating mode.  This document helps provide a framework
      for enterprise network architects or administrators who may be faced
      with many of these challenges as they consider their IPv6 support
      strategies.

  "NAT64 Operational Experiences", Gang Chen, Zhen Cao, Chongfeng Xie,
  David Binet, 2013-07-08, <draft-ietf-v6ops-nat64-experience-02.txt>

      This document summarizes NAT64 function deployment scenarios and
      operational experience.  Both NAT64-CGN (NAT64 Carrier Grade NATs)
      and NAT64-FE (NAT64 server Front End) are considered in this
      document.

  "IPv6 for 3GPP Cellular Hosts", Jouni Korhonen, Jari Arkko, Teemu

      As the deployment of third and fourth generation cellular networks
      progresses, a large number of cellular hosts are being connected to
      the Internet.  Standardization organizations have made Internet
      Protocol version 6 (IPv6) mandatory in their specifications.
      However, the concept of IPv6 covers many aspects and numerous
      specifications.  In addition, the characteristics of cellular links
      in terms of bandwidth, cost and delay put special requirements on how
      IPv6 is used.  This document considers IPv6 for cellular hosts that
      attach to the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Universal Mobile
      Telecommunications System (UMTS), or Evolved Packet System (EPS)
      networks (Hereafter collectively referred to as 3GPP networks).  This
      document also lists out specific IPv6 functionalities that need to be
      implemented in addition what is already prescribed in the IPv6 Node
      Requirements document.  It also discusses some issues related to the
      use of these components when operating in these networks.  This
      document obsoletes RFC 3316.

  "Design Choices for IPv6 Networks", Philip Matthews, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-design-choices-00.txt>

      This document presents advice on the design choices that arise when
      designing IPv6 networks (both dual-stack and IPv6-only).  The
      intended audience is someone designing an IPv6 network who is
      knowledgeable about best current practices around IPv4 network
      design, and wishes to learn the corresponding practices for IPv6.

  "Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Profile for 3GPP Mobile Devices",
  David Binet, Mohamed Boucadair, Vizdal Ales, Cameron Byrne, Gang Chen,
  2013-06-11, <draft-ietf-v6ops-mobile-device-profile-04.txt>

      This document specifies an IPv6 profile for 3GPP mobile devices.  It
      lists the set of features a 3GPP mobile device is to be compliant
      with to connect to an IPv6-only or dual-stack wireless network
      (including 3GPP cellular network and IEEE 802.11 network).
      
      This document defines a different profile than the one for general
      connection to IPv6 cellular networks defined in
      [I-D.ietf-v6ops-rfc3316bis].  In particular, this document identifies
      also features to deliver IPv4 connectivity service over an IPv6-only
      transport.
      
      Both hosts and devices with capability to share their WAN (Wide Area
      Network) connectivity are in scope.

  "Public Key Pinning Extension for HTTP", Chris Evans, Chris Palmer, Ryan
  Sleevi, 2013-07-11, <draft-ietf-websec-key-pinning-08.txt>

      This memo describes an extension to the HTTP protocol allowing web
      host operators to instruct user agents (UAs) to remember ("pin") the
      hosts' cryptographic identities for a given period of time.  During
      that time, UAs will require that the host present a certificate chain
      including at least one Subject Public Key Info structure whose
      fingerprint matches one of the pinned fingerprints for that host.  By
      effectively reducing the number of authorities who can authenticate
      the domain during the lifetime of the pin, pinning may reduce the
      incidence of man-in-the-middle attacks due to compromised
      Certification Authorities.

  "HTTP Header Field X-Frame-Options", David Ross, Tobias Gondrom,

      To improve the protection of web applications against Clickjacking,
      this definition describes the X-Frame-Options HTTP response header
      field that declares a policy communicated from the server to the
      client browser on whether the browser may display the transmitted
      content in frames that are part of other web pages.  This
      informational document serves to document the existing use and
      specification of this X-Frame-Options HTTP response header field.

  "Web Security Framework: Problem Statement and Requirements", Jeff
  Hodges, 2013-02-18, <draft-ietf-websec-framework-reqs-00.txt>

      Web-based malware and attacks are proliferating rapidly on the
      Internet.  New web security mechanisms are also rapidly growing in
      number, although in an incoherent fashion.  This document provides a
      brief overview of the present situation and the various seemingly
      piece-wise approaches being taken to mitigate the threats.  It then
      provides an overview of requirements as presently being expressed by
      the community in various online and face-to-face discussions.

  "Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) Session Continuation: Problem
  Statement", Nico Williams, 2013-07-07,
  <draft-ietf-websec-session-continue-prob-00.txt>

      One of the most often talked about problems in web security is
      "cookies".  Web cookies are a method of associating requests with
      "sessions" that may have been authenticated somehow.  Cookies are a
      form of bearer token that leave much to be desired.  This document
      describes the session "continuation" problem for the HyperText
      Transport Protocol (HTTP).

  "Redirection Service for Registration Data Access Protocol", Carlos
  Martinez, Arturo Servin, Linlin Zhou, Dario Gomez, Gerardo Rada,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-weirds-redirects-02.txt>

      The traditional WHOIS protocol has several important shortcomings,
      and over the past few years several approaches to a better
      Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) have been discussed and
      proposed.
      
      It is worth noting that the term WHOIS is sometimes used
      interchangeably to mean either (a) the registration data itself or
      (b) the protocol used to access registration data
      
      Among these shortcomings, different registries operate different
      WHOIS services.  For users this means that several WHOIS queries to
      different registries may be necessary in order to obtain data for a
      given resource.
      
      This document describes a redirection service for RDAP queries.  This
      service allows clients to query a single RDAP service and expect
      either an authoritative answer or a redirection hint pointing to
      another, possibly authoritative, RDAP server.
      
      The solution implemented proposed here applies to Regional Internet
      Registries(RIRs) and Domain Name Registries(DNRs).
