IPv6 over Low power WPAN (6lowpan)
----------------------------------

  "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over BLUETOOTH Low Energy", Johanna
  Nieminen, Teemu Savolainen, Markus Isomaki, Basavaraj Patil, Zach
  Shelby, Carles Gomez, 2013-02-12, <draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle-12.txt>

      BLUETOOTH Low Energy is a low power air interface technology defined
      by the BLUETOOTH Special Interest Group (BT-SIG).  The standard
      BLUETOOTH radio has been widely implemented and available in mobile
      phones, notebook computers, audio headsets and many other devices.
      The low power version of BLUETOOTH is a new specification that
      enables the use of this air interface with devices such as sensors,
      smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low power variant of BLUETOOTH is
      currently specified in the revision 4.0 of the BLUETOOTH
      specifications (BLUETOOTH 4.0).  This document describes how IPv6 is
      transported over BLUETOOTH Low Energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

IPv6 Maintenance (6man)
-----------------------

  "Considerations for IPv6 Address Selection Policy Changes", Tim Chown,
  Arifumi Matsumoto, 2013-04-01,
  <draft-ietf-6man-addr-select-considerations-05.txt>

      This ducument is intended to capture the address selection design
      team's considerations about the address selection issues mainly
      raised in [RFC5220].  This considerations led to the revision of RFC
      3484 [RFC6724], and Address Selection DHCP option.  Although it does
      not perfectly match the current state, this document captures the
      past discussion and considerations for the historical record.

  "Distributing Address Selection Policy using DHCPv6", Arifumi Matsumoto,
  Tomohiro Fujisaki, Tim Chown, 2013-04-29,
  <draft-ietf-6man-addr-select-opt-10.txt>

      RFC 6724 defines default address selection mechanisms for IPv6 that
      allow nodes to select an appropriate address when faced with multiple
      source and/or destination addresses to choose between.  The RFC 6724
      allowed for the future definition of methods to administratively
      configure the address selection policy information.  This document
      defines a new DHCPv6 option for such configuration, allowing a site
      administrator to distribute address selection policy overriding the
      default address selection parameters and policy table, and thus
      control the address selection behavior of nodes in their site.

  "Neighbor Unreachability Detection is too impatient", Erik Nordmark,
  Igor Gashinsky, 2013-04-24, <draft-ietf-6man-impatient-nud-06.txt>

      IPv6 Neighbor Discovery includes Neighbor Unreachability Detection.
      That function is very useful when a host has an alternative neighbor,
      for instance when there are multiple default routers, since it allows
      the host to switch to the alternative neighbor in short time.  This
      time is 3 seconds after the node starts probing by default.  However,
      if there are no alternative neighbors, this is far too impatient.
      This document specifies relaxed rules for Neighbor Discovery
      retransmissions that allow an implementation to choose different
      timeout behavior based on whether or not there are alternative
      neighbors.  This document updates RFC 4861.

  "Enhanced Duplicate Address Detection", Rajiv Asati, Hemant Singh, Wes
  Beebee, Eli Dart, Wesley George, Carlos Pignataro, 2013-05-24,
  <draft-ietf-6man-enhanced-dad-03.txt>

      Appendix A of the IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) document in
      RFC 4862 discusses Loopback Suppression and DAD.  However, RFC 4862
      does not settle on one specific automated means to detect loopback of
      Neighbor Discovery (ND of RFC 4861) messages used by DAD.  Several
      service provider communities have expressed a need for automated
      detection of looped backed ND messages used by DAD.  This document
      includes mitigation techniques and then outlines the Enhanced DAD
      algorithm to automate detection of looped back IPv6 ND messages used
      by DAD.  For network loopback tests, the Enhanced DAD algorithm
      allows IPv6 to self-heal after a loopback is placed and removed.
      Further, for certain access networks the document automates resolving
      a specific duplicate address conflict.

  "A method for Generating Stable Privacy-Enhanced Addresses with IPv6
  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)", Fernando Gont, 2013-06-12,
  <draft-ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses-10.txt>

      This document specifies a method for generating IPv6 Interface
      Identifiers to be used with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
      (SLAAC), such that addresses configured using this method are stable
      within each subnet, but the Interface Identifier changes when hosts
      move from one network to another.  This method is meant to be an
      alternative to generating Interface Identifiers based on hardware
      address (e.g., using IEEE identifiers), such that the benefits of
      stable addresses can be achieved without sacrificing the privacy of
      users.  The method specified in this document applies to all prefixes
      a host may be employing, including link-local, global, and unique-
      local addresses.

  "Security Implications of IPv6 Fragmentation with IPv6 Neighbor
  Discovery", Fernando Gont, 2013-06-02,
  <draft-ietf-6man-nd-extension-headers-05.txt>

      This document analyzes the security implications of employing IPv6
      fragmentation with Neighbor Discovery (ND) messages.  It updates RFC
      4861 such that use of the IPv6 Fragmentation Header is forbidden in
      all Neighbor Discovery messages, thus allowing for simple and
      effective counter-measures for Neighbor Discovery attacks.  Finally,
      it discusses the security implications of using IPv6 fragmentation
      with SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND), and formally updates RFC 3971
      to provide advice regarding how the aforementioned security
      implications can be prevented.

  "Implications of Oversized IPv6 Header Chains", Fernando Gont, Vishwas
  Manral, Ron Bonica, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-6man-oversized-header-chain-03.txt>

      The IPv6 specification allows IPv6 header chains of an arbitrary
      size.  The specification also allows options which can in turn extend
      each of the headers.  In those scenarios in which the IPv6 header
      chain or options are unusually long and packets are fragmented, or
      scenarios in which the fragment size is very small, the first
      fragment of a packet may fail to include the entire IPv6 header
      chain.  This document discusses the interoperability and security
      problems of such traffic, and updates RFC 2460 such that the first
      fragment of a packet is required to contain the entire IPv6 header
      chain.

  "Packet loss resiliency for Router Solicitations", Suresh Krishnan,
  Dmitry Anipko, Dave Thaler, 2013-05-06,
  <draft-ietf-6man-resilient-rs-01.txt>

      When an interface on a host is initialized, the host transmits Router
      Solicitations in order to minimize the amount of time it needs to
      wait until the next unsolicited multicast Router Advertisement is
      received.  In certain scenarios, these router solicitations
      transmitted by the host might be lost.  This document specifies a
      mechanism for hosts to cope with the loss of the initial Router
      Solicitations.  Furthermore, on some links, unsolicited multicast
      Router Advertisements are never sent and the mechanism in this
      document is intended to work even in such scenarios.

  "Security Implications of Predictable Fragment Identification Values",
  Fernando Gont, 2013-03-22,
  <draft-ietf-6man-predictable-fragment-id-00.txt>

      IPv6 specifies the Fragment Header, which is employed for the
      fragmentation and reassembly mechanisms.  The Fragment Header
      contains an "Identification" field which, together with the IPv6
      Source Address and the IPv6 Destination Address of the packet,
      identifies fragments that correspond to the same original datagram,
      such that they can be reassembled together at the receiving host.
      The only requirement for setting the "Identification" value is that
      it must be different than that of any other fragmented packet sent
      recently with the same Source Address and Destination Address.  Some
      implementations simply use a global counter for setting the Fragment
      Identification field, thus leading to predictable values.  This
      document analyzes the security implications of predictable
      Identification values, and updates RFC 2460 specifying additional
      requirements for setting the Fragment Identification, such that the
      aforementioned security implications are mitigated.

  "Significance of IPv6 Interface Identifiers", Brian Carpenter, Sheng
  Jiang, 2013-05-24, <draft-ietf-6man-ug-01.txt>

      The IPv6 addressing architecture includes a unicast interface
      identifier that is used in the creation of many IPv6 addresses.
      Interface identifiers are formed by a variety of methods.  This
      document clarifies that the bits in an interface identifier have no
      generic meaning and that the identifier should be treated as an
      opaque value.  In particular, RFC 4291 defines a method by which the
      Universal and Group bits of an IEEE link-layer address are mapped
      into an IPv6 unicast interface identifier.  This document clarifies
      that those bits apply only to interface identifiers that are derived
      from an IEEE link-layer address.  It updates RFC 4291 accordingly.

  "Transmission of IPv6 Extension Headers", Brian Carpenter, Sheng Jiang,
  2013-05-29, <draft-ietf-6man-ext-transmit-01.txt>

      Various IPv6 extension headers have been standardised since the IPv6
      standard was first published.  This document updates RFC 2460 to
      clarify how intermediate nodes should deal with such extension
      headers and with any that are defined in future.  It also specifies
      how extension headers should be registered by IANA, with a
      corresponding minor update to RFC 2780.

  "Updates to the IPv6 Multicast Addressing Architecture", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Stig Venaas, 2013-05-23,
  <draft-ietf-6man-multicast-addr-arch-update-01.txt>

      This document updates the IPv6 multicast addressing architecture by
      defining the 17-20 reserved bits as generic flag bits.  The document
      provides also some clarifications related to the use of these flag
      bits.
      
      This document updates RFC 3956, RFC 3306, RFC 4607 and RFC 4291.

IPv6 Site Renumbering (6renum)
------------------------------

  "IPv6 Site Renumbering Gap Analysis", Bing Liu, Sheng Jiang, Brian
  Carpenter, Stig Venaas, Wesley George, 2013-06-09,
  <draft-ietf-6renum-gap-analysis-08.txt>

      This document briefly introduces the existing mechanisms that could
      be utilized for IPv6 site renumbering and tries to cover most of the
      explicit issues and requirements of IPv6 renumbering. Its main
      content is a gap analysis that provides a basis for future works to
      identify and develop solutions or to stimulate such development as
      appropriate. The gap analysis is organized by the main steps of a
      renumbering process.

Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond web (abfab)
------------------------------------------------------------

  "A GSS-API Mechanism for the Extensible Authentication Protocol", Sam
  Hartman, Josh Howlett, 2012-08-13, <draft-ietf-abfab-gss-eap-09.txt>

      This document defines protocols, procedures, and conventions to be
      employed by peers implementing the Generic Security Service
      Application Program Interface (GSS-API) when using the Extensible
      Authentication Protocol mechanism.  Through the GS2 family of
      mechanisms defined in RFC 5801, these protocols also define how
      Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL, RFC 4422)
      applications use the Extensible Authentication Protocol.

  "Name Attributes for the GSS-API EAP mechanism", Sam Hartman, Josh
  Howlett, 2012-11-14, <draft-ietf-abfab-gss-eap-naming-07.txt>

      The naming extensions to the Generic Security Services Application
      Programming interface provide a mechanism for applications to
      discover authorization and personalization information associated
      with GSS-API names.  The Extensible Authentication Protocol GSS-API
      mechanism allows an Authentication/Authorization/Accounting peer to
      provide authorization attributes along side an authentication
      response.  It also provides mechanisms to process Security Assertion
      Markup Language (SAML) messages provided in the AAA response.  This
      document describes the necessary information to use the naming
      extensions API to access that information.

  "A RADIUS Attribute, Binding, Profiles, Name Identifier Format, and
  Confirmation Methods for SAML", Josh Howlett, Sam Hartman, 2013-07-03,
  <draft-ietf-abfab-aaa-saml-06.txt>

      This document specifies a RADIUS attribute, a binding, a name
      identifier format, two profiles, and two confirmation methods for the
      Security Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML).  The attribute provides
      RADIUS encapsulation of SAML protocol messages, and the binding
      describes the use of this attribute, and the SAML protocol messages
      within, with RADIUS transport.  The two profiles describe the
      application of this binding for ABFAB authentication and assertion
      query/request respectively.  The name identifier format allows a
      subject to be named using an NAI, and the subject confirmation
      methods allow queries to be issued for a principal without needing to
      explicitly name the intended subject within the request.  These
      artifacts have been defined to permit application in scenarios other
      than ABFAB, such as network access.

  "Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond web (ABFAB) Use
  Cases", Rhys Smith, 2012-09-25, <draft-ietf-abfab-usecases-05.txt>

      Federated identity is typically associated with Web-based services at
      present, but there is growing interest in its application in non Web-
      based contexts.  The goal of this document is to document a selection
      of the wide variety of these contexts whose user experience could be
      improved through the use of technologies based on the ABFAB
      architecture and specifications.

  "Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond Web (ABFAB)
  Architecture", Josh Howlett, Sam Hartman, Hannes Tschofenig, Eliot Lear,
  Jim Schaad, 2013-07-30, <draft-ietf-abfab-arch-07.txt>

      Over the last decade a substantial amount of work has occurred in the
      space of federated access management.  Most of this effort has
      focused on two use cases: network access and web-based access.
      However, the solutions to these use cases that have been proposed and
      deployed tend to have few common building blocks in common.
      
      This memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions to
      the commonly used security mechanisms for both federated and non-
      federated access management, including the Remote Authentication Dial
      In User Service (RADIUS) and the Diameter protocol, the Generic
      Security Service (GSS), the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
      and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).  The architecture
      addresses the problem of federated access management to primarily
      non-web-based services, in a manner that will scale to large numbers
      of identity providers, relying parties, and federations.

  "Update to the EAP Applicability Statement for ABFAB", Stefan Winter,
  Joseph Salowey, 2013-07-08, <draft-ietf-abfab-eapapplicability-05.txt>

      This document updates the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
      applicability statement from RFC3748 to reflect recent usage of the
      EAP protocol in the Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond
      web (ABFAB) architecture.

ADSL MIB (adslmib)
------------------

  "Definitions of Managed Objects for Very High Speed Digital Subscriber
  Line 2 (VDSL2)", Scott Baillie, Markus Freudenberger, Moti Morgenstern,
  2013-08-01, <draft-ietf-adslmib-xdsl-vop-02.txt>

      This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for
      use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
      particular, it describes objects used for managing parameters of the
      "Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Line 2 (VDSL2)" interface type,
      which are also applicable for managing Asymmetric Digital Subscriber
      Line (ADSL), ADSL2, and ADSL2+ interfaces.

Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (alto)
---------------------------------------------

  "ALTO Protocol", Richard Alimi, Reinaldo Penno, Yang Yang, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-alto-protocol-17.txt>

      Applications using the Internet already have access to some topology
      information of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks.  For
      example, views to Internet routing tables at looking glass servers
      are available and can be practically downloaded to many application
      clients.  What is missing is knowledge of the underlying network
      topologies from the point of view of ISPs.  In other words, what an
      ISP prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and a way to
      distribute it.
      
      The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service provides
      network information (e.g., basic network location structure and
      preferences of network paths) with the goal of modifying network
      resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving
      application performance.  The basic information of ALTO is based on
      abstract maps of a network.  These maps provide a simplified view,
      yet enough information about a network for applications to
      effectively utilize them.  Additional services are built on top of
      the maps.
      
      This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO Service.
      Although the ALTO Service would primarily be provided by ISPs, other
      entities such as content service providers could also operate an ALTO
      service.  Applications that could use this service are those that
      have a choice to which end points to connect.  Examples of such
      applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.

  "ALTO Deployment Considerations", Martin Stiemerling, Sebastian Kiesel,
  Stefano Previdi, Michael Scharf, 2013-07-16,
  <draft-ietf-alto-deployments-07.txt>

      Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as
      pieces of information or server processes, which are available in
      several equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but
      is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal
      of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
      guidance to these applications, which have to select one or several
      hosts from a set of candidates that are able to provide a desired
      resource.  This memo discusses deployment related issues of ALTO.  It
      addresses different use cases of ALTO such as peer-to-peer file
      sharing and CDNs, security considerations, recommendations for
      network administrators, and also guidance for application designers
      using ALTO.

  "ALTO Server Discovery", Sebastian Kiesel, Martin Stiemerling, Nico
  Schwan, Michael Scharf, Song Yongchao, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-alto-server-discovery-09.txt>

      The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
      provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several
      hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired
      resource.  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an
      ALTO client can ask for guidance it needs to discover one or more
      ALTO servers.
      
      This document specifies a procedure for resource consumer initiated
      ALTO server discovery, which can be used if the ALTO client is
      embedded in the resource consumer.

Access Node Control Protocol (ancp)
-----------------------------------

  "Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) MIB module for Access Nodes",
  Stefaan De Cnodder, Moti Morgenstern, 2013-06-24,
  <draft-ietf-ancp-mib-an-11.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
      objects for managing access nodes that are using the Access Node
      Control Protocol (ANCP).

  "Multicast Control Extensions for ANCP", Francois Le Faucheur, Roberta
  Maglione, Tom Taylor, 2013-02-24, <draft-ietf-ancp-mc-extensions-09.txt>

      This document specifies the extensions to the Access Node Control
      Protocol required for support of the multicast use cases defined in
      the Access Node Control Protocol framework document and one
      additional use case described in this document.  These use cases are
      organized into the following ANCP capabilities:
      
      o  NAS-initiated multicast replication;
      
      o  conditional access with white and black lists;
      
      o  conditional access with grey lists;
      
      o  bandwidth delegation;
      
      o  committed bandwidth reporting.
      
      These capabilities may be combined according to the rules given in
      this specification.

Applications Area (app)
-----------------------

  "Prefer Header for HTTP", James Snell, 2013-01-07,
  <draft-snell-http-prefer-18.txt>

      This specification defines an HTTP header field that can be used by a
      client to request that certain behaviors be employed by a server
      while processing a request.

  "Internet Calendar Scheduling Protocol (iSchedule)", Cyrus Daboo,
  Bernard Desruisseaux, 2013-05-03, <draft-desruisseaux-ischedule-05.txt>

      This document defines the Internet Calendar Scheduling Protocol
      (iSchedule), which is a binding from the iCalendar Transport-
      independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) to the Hypertext
      Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to enable interoperability between
      calendaring and scheduling systems over the Internet.

  "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Status Code 308 (Permanent
  Redirect)", Julian Reschke, 2012-03-26,
  <draft-reschke-http-status-308-07.txt>

      This document specifies the additional HyperText Transfer Protocol
      (HTTP) Status Code 308 (Permanent Redirect).

  "File Transfer Protocol HOST Command for Virtual Hosts", Paul Hethmon,
  Robert McMurray, 2013-05-16,
  <draft-hethmon-mcmurray-ftpext-ftp-hosts-02.txt>

      The File Transfer Protocol, as defined in RFC 959, does not provide a
      way for FTP clients and servers to differentiate between multiple DNS
      names that are registered for a single IP address.  This document
      defines a new FTP command that provides a mechanism for FTP clients
      and servers to identify individual virtual hosts on an FTP server.

  "A Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace for IANA Registries", Peter
  Saint-Andre, Michelle Cotton, 2013-02-13,
  <draft-saintandre-iana-urn-01.txt>

      This document defines a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for
      uniquely identifying information contained in registries maintained
      by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

  "Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)", Carsten Bormann, Paul
  Hoffman, 2013-07-14, <draft-bormann-cbor-04.txt>

      The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format
      whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code
      size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need
      for version negotiation.  These design goals make it different from
      earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack.

Applications Area Working Group (appsawg)
-----------------------------------------

  "Advice for Safe Handling of Malformed Messages", Murray Kucherawy,
  Gregory Shapiro, Ned Freed, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-ietf-appsawg-malformed-mail-07.txt>

      Although Internet mail formats have been precisely defined since the
      1970s, authoring and handling software often show only mild
      conformance to the specifications.  The distributed and non-
      interactive nature of email has often prompted adjustments to
      receiving software, to handle these variations, rather than trying to
      gain better conformance by senders, since the receiving operator is
      primarily driven by complaining recipient users and has no authority
      over the sending side of the system.  Processing with such
      flexibility comes at some cost, since mail software is faced with
      decisions about whether or not to permit non-conforming messages to
      continue toward their destinations unaltered, adjust them to conform
      (possibly at the cost of losing some of the original message), or
      outright rejecting them.
      
      A core requirement for interoperability is that both sides of an
      exchange work from the same details and semantics.  By having
      receivers be flexible, beyond the specifications, there can be -- and
      often has been -- a good chance that a message will not be fully
      interoperable.  Worse, a well-established pattern of tolerance for
      variations can sometimes be used as an attack vector.
      
      This document includes a collection of the best advice available
      regarding a variety of common malformed mail situations, to be used
      as implementation guidance.  It must be emphasized, however, that the
      intent of this document is not to standardize malformations or
      otherwise encourage their proliferation.  The messages are manifestly
      malformed, and the code and culture that generates them needs to be
      fixed.  Therefore, these messages should be rejected outright if at
      all possible.  Nevertheless, many malformed messages from otherwise
      legitimate senders are in circulation and will be for some time, and,
      unfortunately, commercial reality shows that we cannot always simply
      reject or discard them.  Accordingly, this document presents
      alternatives for dealing with them in ways that seem to do the least
      additional harm until the infrastructure is tightened up to match the
      standards.

  "Spam reporting using IMAP: SREP", Zoltan Ordogh, 2013-03-11,
  <draft-ordogh-spam-reporting-using-imap-04.txt>

      This document defines an IMAP extension which allows a client to
      report spam by reference and allows an IMAP server to perform any
      action on the reported messages, including leaving the action at the
      client's discretion.
      
      In addition, this document discusses how an IMAP server can tap into

  "Forwarded HTTP Extension", Andreas Petersson, Martin Nilsson,
  2012-10-09, <draft-ietf-appsawg-http-forwarded-10.txt>

      This document defines an HTTP extension header field that allows
      proxy components to disclose information lost in the proxying
      process, for example, the originating IP address of a request or IP
      address of the proxy on the user-agent-facing interface.  In a path
      of proxying components, this makes it possible to arrange it so that
      each subsequent component will have access to, for example, all IP
      addresses used in the chain of proxied HTTP requests.
      
      This document also specifies guidelines for a proxy administrator to
      anonymize the origin of a request.

  "WebFinger", Paul Jones, Gonzalo Salgueiro, Joseph Smarr, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-appsawg-webfinger-16.txt>

      This specification defines the WebFinger protocol, which can be used
      to discover information about people or other entities on the
      Internet using standard HTTP methods.  WebFinger discovers
      information for a URI that might not be usable as a locator
      otherwise, such as account or email URIs.

  "The 'acct' URI Scheme", Peter Saint-Andre, 2013-07-02,
  <draft-ietf-appsawg-acct-uri-06.txt>

      This document defines the 'acct' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
      scheme as a way to identify a user's account at a service provider,
      irrespective of the particular protocols that can be used to interact
      with the account.

  "XML Media Types", Chris Lilley, Murata Makoto, Alexey Melnikov, Henry
  Thompson, 2013-07-08, <draft-ietf-appsawg-xml-mediatypes-02.txt>

      This specification standardizes three media types -- application/xml,
      application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd --
      for use in exchanging network entities that are related to the
      Extensible Markup Language (XML) while defining text/xml and text/
      xml-external-parsed-entity as aliases for the respective application/
      types.  This specification also standardizes a convention (using the
      suffix '+xml') for naming media types outside of these five types
      when those media types represent XML MIME entities.
      
      Major differences from [RFC3023] are alignment of charset handling
      for text/xml and text/xml-external-parsed-entity with application/
      xml, the addition of XPointer and XML Base as fragment identifiers
      and base URIs, respectively, mention of the XPointer Registry, and
      updating of many references.

  "Message Header Field for Indicating Message Authentication Status",
  Murray Kucherawy, 2013-07-11, <draft-ietf-appsawg-rfc5451bis-10.txt>

      This document specifies a message header field called Authentication-
      Results for use with electronic mail messages to indicate the results
      of message authentication efforts.  Any receiver-side software, such
      as mail filters or Mail User Agents (MUAs), can use this header field
      to relay that information in a convenient and meaningful way to
      users, or make sorting and filtering decisions.

  "The application/json-merge-patch Media Type", James Snell, 2013-05-20,
  <draft-ietf-appsawg-json-merge-patch-00.txt>

      This specification defines the application/json-merge-patch media
      type and it's intended use with the HTTP PATCH method defined by RFC
      5789.

  "Sieve Email Filtering: Detecting Duplicate Deliveries", Stephan Bosch,
  2013-05-22, <draft-ietf-appsawg-sieve-duplicate-00.txt>

      This document defines a new test command "duplicate" for the "Sieve"
      email filtering language.  This test adds the ability to detect
      duplicate message deliveries.  The main application for this new test
      is handling duplicate deliveries commonly caused by mailing list
      subscriptions or redirected mail addresses.  The detection is
      normally performed by matching the message ID to an internal list of
      message IDs from previously delivered messages.  For more complex
      applications, the "duplicate" test can also use the content of a
      specific header or other parts of the message.

  "The Require-Recipient-Valid-Since Header Field", William Mills, Murray
  Kucherawy, 2013-08-02, <draft-wmills-rrvs-header-field-01.txt>

      This document defines an email header field, Require-Recipient-Valid-
      Since, to provide a method for senders to indicate to receivers the
      time when the sender last confirmed the ownership of the target
      mailbox.  This can be used to detect changes of mailbox ownership,
      and thus prevent mail from being delivered to the wrong party.
      
      The intended use of this header field is on automatically generated
      messages that might contain sensitive information.

  "Securing the RTP Protocol Framework: Why RTP Does Not Mandate a Single
  Media Security Solution", Colin Perkins, Magnus Westerlund, 2013-05-07,
  <draft-ietf-avt-srtp-not-mandatory-13.txt>

      This memo discusses the problem of securing real-time multimedia
      sessions, and explains why the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP),
      and the associated RTP control protocol (RTCP), do not mandate a
      single media security mechanism.  Guidelines for designers and
      reviewers of future RTP extensions are provided, to ensure that
      appropriate security mechanisms are mandated, and that any such
      mechanisms are specified in a manner that conforms with the RTP
      architecture.

  "Inter-destination Media Synchronization using the RTP Control Protocol
  (RTCP)", Ray van Brandenburg, Hans Stokking, Oskar van Deventer,
  Fernando Boronat, Mario Montagud, Kevin Gross, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-idms-12.txt>

      This document defines a new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Packet Type
      and an RTCP Extended Report (XR) Block Type to be used for achieving
      Inter-Destination Media Synchronization (IDMS).  IDMS is the process
      of synchronizing playout across multiple geographically distributed
      media receivers.  Using the RTCP XR IDMS Report Block defined in this
      document, media playout information from participants in a
      synchronization group can be collected.  Based on the collected
      information, an RTCP IDMS Settings Packet can then be sent to
      distribute a common target playout point to which all the distributed
      receivers, sharing a media experience, can synchronize.
      
      Typical use cases in which IDMS is useful are social TV, shared
      service control (i.e. applications where two or more geographically
      separated users are watching a media stream together), distance
      learning, networked video walls, networked loudspeakers, etc.

  "AES-GCM and AES-CCM Authenticated Encryption in Secure RTP (SRTP)",
  David McGrew, Kevin Igoe, 2013-07-03,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-srtp-aes-gcm-07.txt>

      This document defines how AES-GCM and AES-CCM Authenticated
      Encryption with Associated Data algorithms can be used to provide
      confidentiality and data authentication in the SRTP protocol.

  "The ARIA Algorithm and Its Use with the Secure Real-time Transport
  Protocol(SRTP)", Woo-Hwan Kim, Jungkeun Lee, Dong-Chan Kim, Je-Hong
  Park, Daesung Kwon, 2013-06-26,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-aria-srtp-03.txt,.pdf>

      This document describes the use of the ARIA block cipher algorithm
      within the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for providing
      confidentiality for the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) traffic
      and for the control traffic for RTP, the Real-time Transport Control
      Protocol (RTCP).  It details three modes of operation (CTR, CCM, GCM)
      and a SRTP Key Derivation Function for ARIA.

  "RTP and Leap Seconds", Kevin Gross, Ray van Brandenburg, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-leap-second-03.txt>

      This document discusses issues that arise when RTP sessions span
      Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) leap seconds.  It updates RFC 3550
      to describe how RTP senders and receivers should behave in the
      presence of leap seconds.

  "RTP Clock Source Signalling", Aidan Williams, Kevin Gross, Ray van
  Brandenburg, Hans Stokking, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-clksrc-05.txt>

      NTP format timestamps are used by several RTP protocols for
      synchronisation and statistical measurements.  This memo specifies
      SDP signalling identifying timestamp reference clock sources and SDP
      signalling identifying the media clock sources in a multimedia
      session.

  "Options for Securing RTP Sessions", Magnus Westerlund, Colin Perkins,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-security-options-04.txt>

      The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in a large number of
      different application domains and environments.  This heterogeneity
      implies that different security mechanisms are needed to provide
      services such as confidentiality, integrity and source authentication
      of RTP/RTCP packets suitable for the various environments.  The range
      of solutions makes it difficult for RTP-based application developers
      to pick the most suitable mechanism.  This document provides an
      overview of a number of security solutions for RTP, and gives
      guidance for developers on how to choose the appropriate security
      mechanism.

  "Sending Multiple Types of Media in a Single RTP Session", Magnus
  Westerlund, Colin Perkins, Jonathan Lennox, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-multi-media-rtp-session-03.txt>

      This document specifies how an RTP session can contain media streams
      with media from multiple media types such as audio, video, and text.
      This has been restricted by the RTP Specification, and thus this
      document updates RFC 3550 and RFC 3551 to enable this behaviour for
      applications that satisfy the applicability for using multiple media
      types in a single RTP session.

  "Multimedia Congestion Control: Circuit Breakers for Unicast RTP
  Sessions", Colin Perkins, Varun Singh, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers-03.txt>

      The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony,
      video conferencing, and telepresence applications.  Such applications
      are often run on best-effort UDP/IP networks.  If congestion control
      is not implemented in the applications, then network congestion will
      deteriorate the user's multimedia experience.  This document does not
      propose a congestion control algorithm; instead, it defines a minimal
      set of RTP "circuit-breakers".  Circuit-breakers are conditions under
      which an RTP sender needs to stop transmitting media data in order to
      protect the network from excessive congestion.  It is expected that,
      in the absence of severe congestion, all RTP applications running on
      best-effort IP networks will be able to run without triggering these
      circuit breakers.  Any future RTP congestion control specification
      will be expected to operate within the constraints defined by these
      circuit breakers.

  "Guidelines for Choosing RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Names
  (CNAMEs)", Ali Begen, Colin Perkins, Dan Wing, Eric Rescorla,
  2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-avtcore-6222bis-06.txt>

      The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Name (CNAME) is a
      persistent transport-level identifier for an RTP endpoint.  While the
      Synchronization Source (SSRC) identifier of an RTP endpoint may
      change if a collision is detected or when the RTP application is
      restarted, its RTCP CNAME is meant to stay unchanged, so that RTP
      endpoints can be uniquely identified and associated with their RTP
      media streams.
      
      For proper functionality, RTCP CNAMEs should be unique within the
      participants of an RTP session.  However, the existing guidelines for
      choosing the RTCP CNAME provided in the RTP standard are insufficient
      to achieve this uniqueness.  RFC 6222 was published to update those
      guidelines to allow endpoints to choose unique RTCP CNAMEs.
      Unfortunately, later investigations showed that some parts of the new
      algorithms were unnecessarily complicated and/or ineffective.  This
      document addresses these concerns and replaces RFC 6222.

  "Update to Remove DVI4 from the Recommended Codecs for the RTP Profile
  for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control (RTP/AVP)", Timothy
  Terriberry, 2013-07-02, <draft-ietf-avtcore-avp-codecs-03.txt>

      The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control
      (RTP/AVP) is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure
      Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for
      Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/
      AVPF), and the Extended Secure RTP Profile for RTCP-Based Feedback
      (RTP/SAVPF).  This document updates RFC 3551, the RTP/AVP profile
      (and by extension, the profiles that build upon it) to reflect
      changes in audio codec usage since the document was originally
      published.

  "RTP Topologies", Magnus Westerlund, Stephan Wenger, 2013-04-22,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-topologies-update-00.txt>

      This document discusses point to point and multi-endpoint topologies
      used in Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)-based environments.  In
      particular, centralized topologies commonly employed in the video
      conferencing industry are mapped to the RTP terminology.
      
      This document is updated with additional topologies and are intended
      to replace RFC 5117.

  "Guidelines for using the Multiplexing Features of RTP to Support
  Multiple Media Streams", Magnus Westerlund, BoB, Colin Perkins, Harald
  Alvestrand, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-avtcore-multiplex-guidelines-01.txt>

      The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a flexible protocol that
      can be used in a wide range of applications, networks, and system
      topologies.  That flexibility makes for wide applicability, but can
      complicate the application design process.  One particular design
      question that has received much attention is how to support multiple
      media streams in RTP.  This memo discusses the available options and
      design trade-offs, and provides guidelines on how to use the
      multiplexing features of RTP to support multiple media streams.

  "Sending Multiple Media Streams in a Single RTP Session", Jonathan
  Lennox, Magnus Westerlund, Wenson Wu, Colin Perkins, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-01.txt>

      This document expands and clarifies the behavior of the Real-Time
      Transport Protocol (RTP) endpoints when they are sending multiple
      media streams in a single RTP session.  In particular, issues
      involving Real-Time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) messages are
      described.
      
      This document updates RFC 3550 in regards to handling of multiple
      SSRCs per endpoint in RTP sessions.

  "Sending Multiple Media Streams in a Single RTP Session: Grouping RTCP
  Reception Statistics and Other Feedback", Jonathan Lennox, Magnus
  Westerlund, Wenson Wu, Colin Perkins, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-optimisation-00.txt>

      RTP allows multiple media streams to be sent in a single session, but
      requires each Synchronisation Source (SSRC) to send RTCP reception
      quality reports for every other SSRC visible in the session.  This
      causes the number of RTCP reception reports to grow with the number
      of SSRCs, rather than the number of endpoints.  In many cases most of
      these RTCP reception reports are unnecessary, since all SSRCs of an
      endpoint are co-located and see the same reception quality.  This
      memo defines a Reporting Group extension to RTCP to reduce the
      reporting overhead in such scenarios.

Audio/Video Transport Extensions (avtext)
-----------------------------------------

  "Support for Multiple Clock Rates in an RTP Session", Marc
  Petit-Huguenin, Glen Zorn, 2013-04-21,
  <draft-ietf-avtext-multiple-clock-rates-09.txt>

      This document clarifies the RTP specification when different clock
      rates are used in an RTP session.  It also provides guidance on how
      to interoperate with legacy RTP implementations that use multiple
      clock rates.

  "Duplicating RTP Streams", Ali Begen, Colin Perkins, 2013-03-21,
  <draft-ietf-avtext-rtp-duplication-02.txt>

      Packet loss is undesirable for real-time multimedia sessions, but can
      occur due to congestion, or other unplanned network outages.  This is
      especially true for IP multicast networks, where packet loss patterns
      can vary greatly between receivers.  One technique that can be used
      to recover from packet loss without incurring unbounded delay for all
      the receivers is to duplicate the packets and send them in separate
      redundant streams.  This document explains how Real-time Transport
      Protocol (RTP) streams can be duplicated without breaking RTP or RTP
      Control Protocol (RTCP) rules.

Behavior Engineering for Hindrance Avoidance (behave)
-----------------------------------------------------

  "Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Network Address
  Translation", Randall Stewart, Michael Tuexen, Irene Ruengeler,
  2013-02-25, <draft-ietf-behave-sctpnat-08.txt>

      Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable
      communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to
      TCP [RFC0793].  With the widespread deployment of Network Address
      Translators (NAT), specialized code has been added to NAT for TCP
      that allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT and yet use only a
      single globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts (behind a
      NAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection.  This
      additional code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port
      Translation or NAPT.  To date, specialized code for SCTP has NOT yet
      been added to most NATs so that only pure NAT is available.  The end
      result of this is that only one SCTP capable host can be behind a
      NAT.
      
      This document describes an SCTP specific variant of NAT which
      provides similar features of NAPT in the single point and multi-point
      traversal scenario.

  "Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis", Teemu
  Savolainen, Jouni Korhonen, Dan Wing, 2013-04-04,
  <draft-ietf-behave-nat64-discovery-heuristic-17.txt>

      This document describes a method for detecting the presence of DNS64
      and for learning the IPv6 prefix used for protocol translation on an
      access network.  The method depends on the existence of a well-known
      IPv4-only fully qualified domain name "ipv4only.arpa".  The
      information learned enables nodes to perform local IPv6 address
      synthesis and to potentially avoid NAT64 on dual-stack and multi-
      interface deployments.

  "Analysis of solution proposals for hosts to learn NAT64 prefix", Jouni
  Korhonen, Teemu Savolainen, 2012-03-08,
  <draft-ietf-behave-nat64-learn-analysis-03.txt>

      Hosts and applications may benefit from the knowledge if an IPv6
      address is synthesized, which would mean a NAT64 is used to reach the
      IPv4 network or Internet.  This document analyses a number of
      proposed solutions for communicating whether the synthesis is taking
      place, used address format, and the IPv6 prefix used by the NAT64 and
      DNS64.  The solutions enable both NAT64 avoidance and intentional
      utilization by allowing local IPv6 address synthesis.  The document
      concludes by recommending selection of heuristic discovery based
      solution.

  "Additional Managed Objects for Network Address Translators (NAT)",
  Simon Perreault, Tina Tsou, Senthil Sivakumar, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-behave-nat-mib-07.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for devices implementing Network Address Translator (NAT) function.
      This MIB module may be used for monitoring of a device capable of NAT
      function.

  "Syslog Format for NAT Logging", Zhonghua Chen, Cathy Zhou, Tina Tsou,
  Tom Taylor, 2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-behave-syslog-nat-logging-02.txt>

      With the wide deployment of Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) devices, the
      logging of NAT-related events has become very important for various
      operational purposes.  The logs may be required for troubleshooting,
      to identify a host that was used to launch malicious attacks, and/or
      for accounting purposes.  This document identifies the events that
      need to be logged and the parameters that are required in the logs
      depending on the context in which the NAT is being used.  It goes on
      to standardize formats for reporting these events and parameters
      using SYSLOG (RFC 5424).  A companion document specifies formats for
      reporting the same events and parameters using IPFIX (RFC 5101).
      Applicability statements are provided in this document and its
      companion to guide operators and implementors in their choice of
      which technology to use for logging.

  "IPFIX Information Elements for logging NAT Events", Senthil Sivakumar,
  Reinaldo Penno, 2013-03-19, <draft-ietf-behave-ipfix-nat-logging-00.txt>

      NAT devices are required to log events like creation and deletion of
      translations and information about the resources it is managing.
      With the wide deployment of Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) devices, the
      logging of events have become very important for legal purposes.  The
      logs are required in many cases to identify an attacker or a host
      that was used to launch malicious attacks and/or for various other
      purposes of accounting.  Since there is no standard way of logging
      this information, different NAT devices behave differently and hence
      it is difficult to expect a consistent behavior.  The lack of a
      consistent way makes it difficult to write the collector applications
      that would receive this data and process it to present useful
      information.  This document describes the information that is
      required to be logged by the NAT devices.

  "Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements Updates",
  Reinaldo Penno, Simon Perreault, Mohamed Boucadair, Kengo Naito,
  2013-06-03, <draft-ietf-behave-requirements-update-00.txt>

      This document clarifies and updates several requirements of RFC4787,
      RFC5382 and RFC5508 based on operational and development experience.
      The focus of this document is NAPT44.

Binary Floor Control Protocol Bis  (bfcpbis)
--------------------------------------------

  "The Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP)", Gonzalo Camarillo, Keith
  Drage, Tom Kristensen, Joerg Ott, Charles Eckel, 2013-04-26,
  <draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis-09.txt>

      Floor control is a means to manage joint or exclusive access to
      shared resources in a (multiparty) conferencing environment.
      Thereby, floor control complements other functions -- such as
      conference and media session setup, conference policy manipulation,
      and media control -- that are realized by other protocols.
      
      This document specifies the Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP).
      BFCP is used between floor participants and floor control servers,
      and between floor chairs (i.e., moderators) and floor control
      servers.
      
      This document obsoletes RFC 4582.  Changes from RFC 4582 are
      summarized in Section 16.

  "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Format for Binary Floor Control
  Protocol (BFCP) Streams", Gonzalo Camarillo, Tom Kristensen, 2013-04-26,
  <draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4583bis-07.txt>

      This document specifies how to describe Binary Floor Control Protocol
      (BFCP) streams in Session Description Protocol (SDP) descriptions.
      User agents using the offer/answer model to establish BFCP streams
      use this format in their offers and answers.
      
      This document obsoletes RFC 4583.  Changes from RFC 4583 are
      summarized in Section 12.

Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (bfd)
----------------------------------------

  "BFD Management Information Base", Thomas Nadeau, Zafar Ali, Nobo Akiya,
  2013-06-26, <draft-ietf-bfd-mib-14.txt,.pdf>

      This draft defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
      In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling
      Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol.

  "Definitions of Textual Conventions (TCs) for Bidirectional Forwarding
  Detection (BFD) Management", Thomas Nadeau, Zafar Ali, Nobo Akiya,
  2013-06-19, <draft-ietf-bfd-tc-mib-02.txt,.pdf>

      This draft defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module which
      contains Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Bidirectional
      Forwarding Detection (BFD) management information.  The intent is
      that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in BFD
      related MIB modules that would otherwise define their own
      representations.

  "BFD Generic Cryptographic Authentication", Manav Bhatia, Vishwas
  Manral, Dacheng Zhang, 2013-04-18,
  <draft-ietf-bfd-generic-crypto-auth-04.txt>

      This document proposes an extension to Bidirectional Forwarding
      Detection (BFD) to allow the use of arbitary cryptographic
      authentication algorithms in addition to the already-documented
      authentication schemes described in the base specification.  This
      document adds the basic infrastructure that is required for
      supporting algorithm and key agility for BFD.

  "BFD for Multipoint Networks", Dave Katz, David Ward, 2013-05-17,
  <draft-ietf-bfd-multipoint-02.txt>

      This document describes extensions to the Bidirectional Forwarding
      Detection (BFD) protocol for its use in multipoint and multicast
      networks.  Comments on this draft should be directed to

  "Authenticating BFD using HMAC-SHA-2 procedures", Dacheng Zhang, Manav
  Bhatia, Vishwas Manral, 2013-04-18, <draft-ietf-bfd-hmac-sha-03.txt>

      This document describes the mechanism to authenticate Bidirectional
      Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol packets using Hashed Message
      Authentication Mode (HMAC) with the SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512
      algorithms.  The described mechanism uses the Generic Cryptographic
      Authentication and Generic Meticulous Cryptographic Authentication
      sections to carry the authentication data.  This document updates,
      but does not supercede, the cryptographic authentication mechanism
      specified in RFC 5880.

  "BFD Management Information Base (MIB) extensions for MPLS and MPLS-TP
  Networks", Sam Aldrin, Venkatesan Mahalingam, Kannan Sampath, Thomas
  Nadeau, 2013-06-27, <draft-ietf-bfd-mpls-mib-02.txt>

      This draft defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
      In particular, it extends the BFD Management Information Base BFD-
      STD-MIB and describes the managed objects for modeling Bidirectional
      Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol for MPLS and MPLS-TP networks.

  "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) on Link Aggregation Group
  (LAG) Interfaces", Manav Bhatia, Mach Chen, Sami Boutros, Marc
  Binderberger, Jeffrey Haas, 2013-06-13, <draft-ietf-bfd-on-lags-01.txt>

      This document proposes a mechanism to run BFD on Link Aggregation
      Group (LAG) interfaces.  It does so by running an independent
      Asynchronous mode BFD session on every LAG member link.
      
      This mechanism allows the verification of member link continuity,
      either in combination with, or in absence of, LACP.  It provides a
      shorter detection time than what LACP offers.  The continuity check
      can also cover elements of layer 3 bidirectional forwarding.
      
      This mechanism utilizes a well-known UDP port distinct from that of
      single-hop BFD over IP.  This new UDP port removes the ambiguity of
      BFD over LAG packets from BFD over single-hop IP.

Basic Level of Interoperability for SIP Services (bliss)

  "Shared Appearances of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Address of
  Record (AOR)", Alan Johnston, Mohsen Soroushnejad, Venkatesh
  Venkataramanan, 2013-01-16, <draft-ietf-bliss-shared-appearances-15.txt>

      This document describes the requirements and implementation of a
      group telephony feature commonly known as Bridged Line Appearance
      (BLA) or Multiple Line Appearance (MLA), or Shared Call/Line
      Appearance (SCA).  When implemented using the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP), it is referred to as shared appearances of an Address
      of Record (AOR) since SIP does not have the concept of lines.  This
      feature is commonly offered in IP Centrex services and IP-PBX
      offerings and is likely to be implemented on SIP IP telephones and
      SIP feature servers used in a business environment.  This feature
      allows several user agents (UAs) to share a common AOR, learn about
      calls placed and received by other UAs in the group, and pick up or
      join calls within the group.  This document discusses use cases,
      lists requirements and defines extensions to implement this feature.
      This specification updates RFC3261 and RFC4235.

Benchmarking Methodology (bmwg)
-------------------------------

  "Benchmarking Methodology for Content-Aware Network Devices", Mike
  Hamilton, Sarah Banks, 2013-02-06,
  <draft-ietf-bmwg-ca-bench-meth-04.txt>

      This document defines a set of test scenarios and metrics that can be
      used to benchmark content-aware network devices.  The scenarios in
      the following document are intended to more accurately predict the
      performance of these devices when subjected to dynamic traffic
      patterns.  This document will operate within the constraints of the
      Benchmarking Working Group charter, namely black box characterization
      in a laboratory environment.

  "Basic BGP Convergence Benchmarking Methodology for Data Plane
  Convergence", Rajiv Papneja, Bhavani Parise, Susan Hares, Dean Lee, Ilya
  Varlashkin, 2013-07-02, <draft-ietf-bmwg-bgp-basic-convergence-00.txt>

      BGP is widely deployed and used by several service providers as the
      default Inter AS routing protocol.  It is of utmost importance to
      ensure that when a BGP peer or a downstream link of a BGP peer fails,
      the alternate paths are rapidly used and routes via these alternate
      paths are installed.  This document provides the basic BGP
      Benchmarking Methodology using existing BGP Convergence Terminology,
      RFC 4098.

  "Routing and Wavelength Assignment Information Model for Wavelength
  Switched Optical Networks", Young Lee, Greg Bernstein, Dan Li, Wataru
  Imajuku, 2013-05-13, <draft-ietf-ccamp-rwa-info-18.txt>

      This document provides a model of information needed by the routing
      and wavelength assignment (RWA) process in wavelength switched
      optical networks (WSONs).  The purpose of the information described
      in this model is to facilitate constrained lightpath computation in
      WSONs. This model takes into account compatibility constraints
      between WSON signal attributes and network elements but does not
      include constraints due to optical impairments. Aspects of this
      information that may be of use to other technologies utilizing a
      GMPLS control plane are discussed.

  "Routing and Wavelength Assignment Information Encoding for Wavelength
  Switched Optical Networks", Greg Bernstein, Young Lee, Dan Li, Wataru
  Imajuku, 2013-03-15, <draft-ietf-ccamp-rwa-wson-encode-20.txt>

      A wavelength switched optical network (WSON) requires that certain
      key information elements are made available to facilitate path
      computation and the establishment of label switching paths (LSPs).
      The information model described in "Routing and Wavelength
      Assignment Information for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks"
      shows what information is required at specific points in the WSON.
      Part of the WSON information model contains aspects that may be of
      general applicability to other technologies, while other parts are
      fairly specific to WSONs.
      
      This document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for
      the WSON specific information elements. It is intended that
      protocol-specific documents will reference this memo to describe how
      information is carried for specific uses. Such encodings can be used
      to extend GMPLS signaling and routing protocols. In addition these
      encodings could be used by other mechanisms to convey this same
      information to a path computation element (PCE).

  "GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for Ethernet OAM Configuration", Attila
  Takacs, Balazs Gero, Hao Long, 2013-06-15,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-eth-oam-ext-10.txt>

      The GMPLS controlled Ethernet Label Switching (GELS) work extended
      GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the establishment of Ethernet LSPs.  IEEE
      Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) specifies an adjunct OAM
      flow to check connectivity in Ethernet networks.  CFM can be also
      used with Ethernet LSPs for fault detection and triggering recovery
      mechanisms.  The ITU-T Y.1731 specification builds on CFM and
      specifies additional OAM mechanisms, including Performance
      Monitoring, for Ethernet networks.  This document specifies
      extensions of GMPLS RSVP-TE protocol to support the setup of the
      associated Ethernet OAM entities of Ethernet LSPs, and defines the
      Ethernet technology specific TLVs based on [OAM-CONF-FWK].  This
      document supports, but does not modify, the IEEE and ITU-T OAM
      mechanisms.

  "GMPLS RSVP-TE extensions for OAM Configuration", Attila Takacs, Don
  Fedyk, He Jia, 2013-06-15,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-oam-configuration-fwk-10.txt>

      OAM is an integral part of transport connections, hence it is
      required that OAM functions are activated/deactivated in sync with
      connection commissioning/decommissioning; avoiding spurious alarms
      and ensuring consistent operation.  In certain technologies, OAM
      entities are inherently established once the connection is set up,
      while other technologies require extra configuration to establish and
      configure OAM entities.  This document specifies extensions to
      RSVP-TE to support the establishment and configuration of OAM
      entities along with LSP signaling.

  "GMPLS OSPF Enhancement for Signal and Network Element Compatibility for
  Wavelength Switched Optical Networks", Young Lee, Greg Bernstein,
  2013-02-06, <draft-ietf-ccamp-wson-signal-compatibility-ospf-11.txt>

      This document provides GMPLS OSPF routing enhancements to support
      signal compatibility constraints associated with WSON network
      elements. These routing enhancements are required in common optical
      or hybrid electro-optical networks where not all of the optical
      signals in the network are compatible with all network elements
      participating in the network.
      
      This compatibility constraint model is applicable to common optical
      or hybrid electro optical systems such as OEO switches,
      regenerators, and wavelength converters since such systems can be
      limited to processing only certain types of WSON signals.

  "General Network Element Constraint Encoding for GMPLS Controlled
  Networks", Greg Bernstein, Young Lee, Dan Li, Wataru Imajuku,
  2013-05-06, <draft-ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode-11.txt>

      Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching can be used to control a
      wide variety of technologies. In some of these technologies network
      elements and links may impose additional routing constraints such as
      asymmetric switch connectivity, non-local label assignment, and
      label range limitations on links.
      
      This document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for
      general information elements representing connectivity and label
      constraints as well as label availability. It is intended that
      protocol-specific documents will reference this memo to describe how
      information is carried for specific uses.

  "Configuration of Pro-Active Operations, Administration, and Maintenance

  2013-06-20, <draft-ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-mpls-tp-oam-ext-12.txt>

      This specification describes the configuration of pro-active MPLS-TP
      (MPLS-Transport Profile) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
      (OAM) Functions for a given LSP using a set of TLVs that are carried
      by the GMPLS RSVP-TE protocol based on [OAM-CONF-FWK].
      
      This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
      Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
      Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
      capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

  "Framework for GMPLS and PCE Control of G.709 Optical Transport
  Networks", Fatai Zhang, Dan Li, Han Li, Sergio Belotti, Daniele
  Ceccarelli, 2013-08-02, <draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-g709-framework-14.txt>

      This document provides a framework to allow the development of
      protocol extensions to support Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
      Switching (GMPLS) and Path Computation Element (PCE) control of
      Optical Transport Networks (OTN) as specified in ITU-T Recommendation
      G.709 as published in 2012.

  "Signaling Extensions for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks", Greg
  Bernstein, Sugang Xu, Young Lee, Giovanni Martinelli, Hiroaki Harai,
  2013-07-05, <draft-ietf-ccamp-wson-signaling-06.txt>

      This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
      Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched
      optical networks (WSON).  Such extensions are necessary in WSONs
      under a number of conditions including: (a) when optional
      processing, such as regeneration, must be configured to occur at
      specific nodes along a path, (b) where equipment must be configured
      to accept an optical signal with specific attributes, or (c) where
      equipment must be configured to output an optical signal with
      specific attributes. In addition this memo provides mechanisms to
      support distributed wavelength assignment with bidirectional LSPs,
      and choice in distributed wavelength assignment algorithms. These
      extensions build on previous work for the control of lambda and
      G.709 based networks.

  "OSPF-TE Extensions for General Network Element Constraints", Fatai
  Zhang, Young Lee, Jianrui Han, Greg Bernstein, Yunbin Xu, 2013-06-26,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-general-constraints-ospf-te-05.txt>

      Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching can be used to control a
      wide variety of technologies including packet switching (e.g., MPLS),
      time-division (e.g., SONET/SDH, OTN), wavelength (lambdas), and
      spatial switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port or
      fiber). In some of these technologies network elements and links may
      impose additional routing constraints such as asymmetric switch
      connectivity, non-local label assignment, and label range
      limitations on links. This document describes OSPF routing protocol
      extensions to support these kinds of constraints under the control
      of Generalized MPLS (GMPLS).

  "RSVP-TE Extensions for Associated Bidirectional LSPs", Fei Zhang,
  Ruiquan Jing, Rakesh Gandhi, 2013-03-18,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-rsvpte-ext-associated-lsp-06.txt>

      The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) requirements document [RFC5654],
      describes that MPLS-TP MUST support associated bidirectional point-
      to-point LSPs.
      
      This document provides a method to bind two unidirectional Label
      Switched Paths (LSPs) into an associated bidirectional LSP.  The
      association is achieved by defining the new Association Types in the
      Extended ASSOCIATION object.

  Guoying Zhang, Sergio Belotti, Daniele Ceccarelli, Khuzema Pithewan,
  2013-07-02, <draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3-11.txt>

      ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G709-2012] has introduced new Optical
      channel Data Unit (ODU) containers (ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex)
      and enhanced Optical Transport Networking (OTN) flexibility.
      
      This document updates the ODU-related portions of RFC4328 to

      collection of Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) Information for the TE
      link formed by a LSP.

  "Revised Definition of The GMPLS Switching Capability and Type Fields",
  Lou Berger, Julien Meuric, 2013-04-17,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-swcaps-update-01.txt>

      GMPLS provides control for multiple switching technologies, and
      hierarchical switching within a technology.  GMPLS routing and
      signaling use common values to indicate switching technology type.
      These values are carried in routing in the Switching Capability
      field, and in signaling in the Switching Type field. While the
      values used in these fields are the primary indicators of the
      technology and hierarchy level being controlled, the values are
      not consistently defined and used across the different
      technologies supported by GMPLS.  This document is intended to
      resolve the inconsistent definition and use of the Switching
      Capability and Type fields by narrowly scoping the meaning and use
      of the fields.  This document updates any document that uses the
      GMPLS Switching Capability and Types fields, in particular RFC
      3471, RFC 4202, RFC 4203, and RFC 5307.

  <draft-ietf-ccamp-lsp-attribute-ro-02.txt>

      LSP attributes can be specified or recorded for whole path, but they
      cannot be targeted to a specific hop.  This document proposes
      alternative ways to extend the semantic for RSVP ERO object to target
      LSP attributes to a specific hop.

  "Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Path

  Ruediger Kunze, Julien Meuric, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-ccamp-lsp-diversity-02.txt>

      RFC 4874 specifies methods by which route exclusions may be
      communicated during RSVP-TE signaling in networks where precise
      explicit paths are not computed by the LSP source node. This
      document specifies signaling for additional route exclusions based
      on Paths currently existing or expected to exist within the network.

  "Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) extension

Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (cdni)
------------------------------------------------

  "Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) Requirements", Kent
  Leung, Yiu Lee, 2013-07-01, <draft-ietf-cdni-requirements-09.txt>

      Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are frequently used for content
      delivery.  As a result of significant growth in content delivered
      over IP networks, existing CDN providers are scaling up their
      infrastructure.  Many Network Service Providers and Enterprise
      Service Providers are also deploying their own CDNs.  To deliver
      contents from the Content Service Protect (CSP) to end users, the
      contents may traverse across multiple CDNs.  This creates a need for
      interconnecting (previously) standalone CDNs so that they can
      collectively act as a single delivery platform from the CSP to the
      end users.
      
      The goal of the present document is to outline the requirements for
      the solution and interfaces to be specified by the CDNI working
      group.

  "Framework for CDN Interconnection", Larry Peterson, Bruce Davie,
  2013-02-18, <draft-ietf-cdni-framework-03.txt,.pdf>

      This document presents a framework for Content Distribution Network
      Interconnection (CDNI).  The purpose of the framework is to provide
      an overall picture of the problem space of CDNI and to describe the
      relationships among the various components necessary to interconnect
      CDNs.  CDN Interconnection requires the specification of several
      interfaces and mechanisms to address issues such as request routing,
      distribution metadata exchange, and logging information exchange
      across CDNs.  The intent of this document is to outline what each
      interface needs to accomplish, and to describe how these interfaces
      and mechanisms fit together, while leaving their detailed
      specification to other documents.  It obsoletes RFC 3466.

  "CDN Interconnect Metadata", Ben Niven-Jenkins, Rob Murray, Grant
  Watson, Matt Caulfield, Kent Leung, Kevin Ma, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-cdni-metadata-02.txt>

      The CDNI Metadata Interface enables interconnected CDNs to exchange
      content distribution metadata in order to enable content acquisition
      and delivery.  The CDNI metadata associated with a piece of content
      provides a downstream CDN with sufficient information for the
      downstream CDN to service content requests on behalf of an upstream
      CDN.  This document describes both the core set of CDNI metadata and
      the protocol for exchanging that metadata.

  "CDNI Logging Interface", Francois Le Faucheur, Gilles Bertrand, Iuniana
  Oprescu, Roy Peterkofsky, 2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-cdni-logging-05.txt>

      This memo specifies the Logging interface between a downstream CDN
      (dCDN) and an upstream CDN (uCDN) that are interconnected as per the
      CDN Interconnection (CDNI) framework.  First, it describes a
      reference model for CDNI logging.  Then, it specifies the CDNI
      Logging File format and the actual protocol for exchange of CDNI
      Logging Files.

  "CDNI Control Interface / Triggers", Rob Murray, Ben Niven-Jenkins,
  2013-04-08, <draft-ietf-cdni-control-triggers-00.txt>

      This document describes the part of the CDN Interconnect Control
      Interface that allows a CDN to trigger activity in an interconnected
      CDN that is configured to deliver content on its behalf.  The
      upstream CDN can use this mechanism to request that the downstream
      CDN pre-positions metadata or content, or that it re-validate or
      purge metadata or content.  The upstream CDN can monitor the status
      of activity that it has triggered in the downstream CDN.

  "Request Routing Redirection Interface for CDN Interconnection", Wang
  Danhua, Ben Niven-Jenkins, Xiaoyan He, Ge Chen, Wei Ni, 2013-04-15,
  <draft-ietf-cdni-redirection-00.txt>

      The Request Routing Interface comprises of (1) the asynchronous
      advertisement of footprint and capabilities by a downstream CDN that
      allows a upstream CDN to decide whether to redirect particular user
      requests to that downstream CDN; and (2) the synchronous operation of
      an upstream CDN requesting whether a downstream CDN is prepared to
      accept a user request and of a downstream CDN responding with how to
      actually redirect the user request.  This document describes an
      interface for the latter part, i.e.  the CDNI request routing/
      Redirection Interface.

  "CDNI Request Routing: Footprint and Capabilities Semantics", Jan
  Seedorf, Jon Peterson, Stefano Previdi, Ray van Brandenburg, Kevin Ma,
  2013-07-17, <draft-ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics-00.txt>

      This document tries to capture the semantics of the "Footprint and
      Capabilities Advertisement" part of the CDNI Request Routing
      interface, i.e. the desired meaning and what "Footprint and
      Capabilities Advertisement" is expected to offer within CDNI.  The
      discussion in this document has the goal to facilitate the choosing
      of one or more suitable protocols for "Footprint and Capabilities
      Advertisement" within CDNI Request Routing.

      ordinary elliptic curves. The ZSS Short Signature Scheme uses general
      cryptographic hash functions such as SHA-1 or SHA-2 and is efficient
      in terms of pairing operations.

  "ZSS Short Signature Scheme", Laura Hitt, 2013-03-14,
  <draft-irtf-cfrg-zss-00.txt>

      This document describes the ZSS Short Signature Scheme for
      implementation from bilinear pairings on supersingular elliptic
      curves. The ZSS Short Signature Scheme uses general cryptographic
      hash functions such as SHA-1 or SHA-2 and is efficient in terms of
      pairing operations.

ControLling mUltiple streams for tElepresence (clue)
----------------------------------------------------

  "Use Cases for Telepresence Multi-streams", Allyn Romanow, Stephen
  Botzko, Mark Duckworth, Roni Even, 2013-04-06,
  <draft-ietf-clue-telepresence-use-cases-05.txt>

      Telepresence conferencing systems seek to create the sense of really
      being present for the participants.  A number of techniques for
      handling audio and video streams are used to create this experience.
      When these techniques are not similar, interoperability between
      different systems is difficult at best, and often not possible.
      Conveying information about the relationships between multiple
      streams of media would allow senders and receivers to make choices to
      allow telepresence systems to interwork.  This memo describes the
      most typical and important use cases for sending multiple streams in
      a telepresence conference.

  "Requirements for Telepresence Multi-Streams", Allyn Romanow, Stephen
  Botzko, Mary Barnes, 2013-07-16,
  <draft-ietf-clue-telepresence-requirements-04.txt>

      This memo discusses the requirements for a specification that enables
      telepresence interoperability, by describing the relationship between
      multiple RTP streams.  In addition, the problem statement and
      definitions are also covered herein.

  "Framework for Telepresence Multi-Streams", Mark Duckworth, Andrew
  Pepperell, Stephan Wenger, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-clue-framework-11.txt>

      This document offers a framework for a protocol that enables
      devices in a telepresence conference to interoperate by specifying
      the relationships between multiple media streams.

  "Mapping RTP streams to CLUE media captures", Roni Even, Jonathan
  Lennox, 2013-02-17, <draft-ietf-clue-rtp-mapping-00.txt>

      This document describes mechanisms and recommended practice for
      mapping RTP media streams defined in SDP to CLUE media captures.

  "An XML Schema for the CLUE data model", Roberta Presta, Simon Romano,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-clue-data-model-schema-00.txt>

      This document provides an XML schema file for the definition of CLUE
      data model types.

Internet Wideband Audio Codec (codec)
-------------------------------------

  "Summary of Opus listening test results", Christian Hoene, Jean-Marc
  Valin, Koen Vos, Jan Skoglund, 2013-05-17,
  <draft-ietf-codec-results-03.txt>

      This document describes and examines listening test results obtained
      for the Opus codec and how they relate to the requirements.

  "Ogg Encapsulation for the Opus Audio Codec", Timothy Terriberry, Ron
  Lee, Ralph Giles, 2013-05-24, <draft-ietf-codec-oggopus-01.txt>

      This document defines the Ogg encapsulation for the Opus interactive
      speech and audio codec.  This allows data encoded in the Opus format
      to be stored in an Ogg logical bitstream.  Ogg encapsulation provides
      Opus with a long-term storage format supporting all of the essential
      features, including metadata, fast and accurate seeking, corruption
      detection, recapture after errors, low overhead, and the ability to
      multiplex Opus with other codecs (including video) with minimal
      buffering.  It also provides a live streamable format, capable of
      delivery over a reliable stream-oriented transport, without requiring
      all the data, or even the total length of the data, up-front, in a
      form that is identical to the on-disk storage format.

Congestion Exposure (conex)
---------------------------

  "Congestion Exposure (ConEx) Concepts and Abstract Mechanism", Matt
  Mathis, Bob Briscoe, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-07.txt>

      This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders inform
      the network about the congestion encountered by packets earlier in
      the same flow.  Today, network elements at any layer may signal
      congestion to the receiver by dropping packets or by ECN markings,
      and the receiver passes this information back to the sender in
      transport-layer feedback.  The mechanism described here enables the
      sender to also relay this congestion information back into the
      network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total amount of
      congestion from all elements on the path is revealed to all IP
      elements along the path, where it could, for example, be used to
      provide input to traffic management.  This mechanism is called
      congestion exposure or ConEx.  The companion document "ConEx Concepts
      and Use Cases" provides the entry-point to the set of ConEx
      documentation.

  "IPv6 Destination Option for ConEx", Suresh Krishnan, Mirja Kuehlewind,
  Carlos Ucendo, 2013-03-28, <draft-ietf-conex-destopt-04.txt>

      ConEx is a mechanism by which senders inform the network about the
      congestion encountered by packets earlier in the same flow.  This
      document specifies an IPv6 destination option that is capable of
      carrying ConEx markings in IPv6 datagrams.

  "TCP modifications for Congestion Exposure", Mirja Kuehlewind, Richard
  Scheffenegger, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-conex-tcp-modifications-04.txt>

      Congestion Exposure (ConEx) is a mechanism by which senders inform
      the network about the congestion encountered by previous packets on
      the same flow.  This document describes the necessary modifications
      to use ConEx with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

  "Mobile Communication Congestion Exposure Scenario", Dirk Kutscher,
  Faisal Mir, Rolf Winter, Suresh Krishnan, Ying Zhang, Carlos Bernardos,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-conex-mobile-02.txt>

      This memo describes a mobile communications use case for congestion
      exposure (CONEX) with a particular focus on mobile communication
      networks such as the 3GPP Evolved Packet System (EPS).  The draft
      provides a brief overview of the architecture of these networks (both
      access and core networks), current QoS mechanisms and then discusses
      how congestion exposure concepts could be applied.  Based on this,
      this memo suggests a set of requirements for CONEX mechanisms that
      particularly apply to mobile networks.

Constrained RESTful Environments (core)
---------------------------------------

  "Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)", Zach Shelby, Klaus Hartke,
  Carsten Bormann, 2013-06-28, <draft-ietf-core-coap-18.txt>

      The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web
      transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained
      (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks.  The nodes often have 8-bit
      microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained
      networks such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error rates and a
      typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s.  The protocol is designed for
      machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and
      building automation.
      
      CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between
      application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and
      resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and
      Internet media types.  CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP
      for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements
      such as multicast support, very low overhead and simplicity for
      constrained environments.

  "Blockwise transfers in CoAP", Carsten Bormann, Zach Shelby, 2013-06-27,
  <draft-ietf-core-block-12.txt>

      CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and
      networks.  Basic CoAP messages work well for the small payloads we
      expect from temperature sensors, light switches, and similar
      building-automation devices.  Occasionally, however, applications
      will need to transfer larger payloads -- for instance, for firmware
      updates.  With HTTP, TCP does the grunt work of slicing large
      payloads up into multiple packets and ensuring that they all arrive
      and are handled in the right order.
      
      CoAP is based on datagram transports such as UDP or DTLS, which
      limits the maximum size of resource representations that can be
      transferred without too much fragmentation.  Although UDP supports
      larger payloads through IP fragmentation, it is limited to 64 KiB
      and, more importantly, doesn't really work well for constrained
      applications and networks.
      
      Instead of relying on IP fragmentation, this specification extends
      basic CoAP with a pair of "Block" options, for transferring multiple
      blocks of information from a resource representation in multiple
      request-response pairs.  In many important cases, the Block options
      enable a server to be truly stateless: the server can handle each
      block transfer separately, with no need for a connection setup or
      other server-side memory of previous block transfers.
      
      In summary, the Block options provide a minimal way to transfer
      larger representations in a block-wise fashion.
      
      The present revision -11 fixes one example and adds the text and
      examples about the Block/Observe interaction, taken from -observe.
      It also adds a couple of formatting bugs from the new xml2rfc.  The
      "grand rewrite" is next.

  "Observing Resources in CoAP", Klaus Hartke, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-core-observe-09.txt>

      CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and
      networks.  The state of a resource on a CoAP server can change over
      time.  This document specifies a simple protocol extension for CoAP
      that enables CoAP clients to "observe" resources, i.e., to retrieve
      a representation of a resource and keep this representation updated
      by the server over a period of time.  The protocol follows a best-
      effort approach for sending new representations to clients, and
      provides eventual consistency between the state observed by each
      client and the actual resource state at the server.

  "Group Communication for CoAP", Akbar Rahman, Esko Dijk, 2013-07-30,
  <draft-ietf-core-groupcomm-12.txt>

      CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained devices and
      constrained networks.  It is anticipated that constrained devices
      will often naturally operate in groups (e.g., in a building
      automation scenario all lights in a given room may need to be
      switched on/off as a group).  This document provides guidance for how
      the CoAP protocol should be used in a group communication context.
      An approach for using CoAP on top of IP multicast is detailed.  Also,
      various use cases and corresponding protocol flows are provided to
      illustrate important concepts.  Finally, guidance is provided for
      deployment in various network topologies.

  "Representing CoRE Link Collections in JSON", Carsten Bormann,
  2013-06-02, <draft-ietf-core-links-json-00.txt>

      Web Linking (RFC5988) provides a way to represent links between Web
      resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes
      of such a link.  In constrained networks, a collection of Web links
      can be exchanged in the CoRE link format (RFC6690).  Outside of
      constrained environments, it may be useful to represent these
      collections of Web links in JSON format (RFC4627).
      
      This specification defines a common format for representing Web links
      in JSON format.

  "CoRE Resource Directory", Zach Shelby, Srdjan Krco, Carsten Bormann,
  2013-06-03, <draft-ietf-core-resource-directory-00.txt>

      In many M2M applications, direct discovery of resources is not
      practical due to sleeping nodes, disperse networks, or networks where
      multicast traffic is inefficient.  These problems can be solved by
      employing an entity called a Resource Directory (RD), which hosts
      descriptions of resources held on other servers, allowing lookups to
      be performed for those resources.  This document specifies the web
      interfaces that a Resource Directory supports in order for web
      servers to discover the RD and to register, maintain, lookup and
      remove resources descriptions.  Furthermore, new link attributes
      useful in conjunction with an RD are defined.

  "CoRE Interfaces", Zach Shelby, Matthieu Vial, 2013-06-03,
  <draft-ietf-core-interfaces-00.txt>

      This document defines well-known REST interface descriptions for
      Batch, Sensor, Parameter and Actuator types for use in contrained web
      servers using the CoRE Link Format.  A short reference is provided
      for each type that can be efficiently included in the interface
      description attribute of the CoRE Link Format.  These descriptions
      are intended to be for general use in resource designs or for
      inclusion in more specific interface profiles.  In addition, this
      document defines the concepts of Function Set and Binding.  The
      former is the basis element to create RESTful profiles and the latter
      helps the configuration of links between resources located on one or
      more endpoints.

  "Best Practices for HTTP-CoAP Mapping Implementation", Angelo
  Castellani, Salvatore Loreto, Akbar Rahman, Thomas Fossati, Esko Dijk,
  2013-07-03, <draft-ietf-core-http-mapping-01.txt>

      This draft provides reference information for HTTP-CoAP protocol
      translation proxy implementors, focusing primarily on the reverse
      proxy case.  It details deployment options, discusses possible
      approaches for URI mapping, and provides a set of guidelines and
      considerations related to protocol translation.

Call Control UUI Service for SIP (cuss)
---------------------------------------

  "A Mechanism for Transporting User to User Call Control Information in
  SIP", Alan Johnston, James Rafferty, 2013-04-09,
  <draft-ietf-cuss-sip-uui-10.txt>

      There is a class of applications which benefit from using SIP to
      exchange User to User Information (UUI) data during session
      establishment.  This information, known as call control UUI data, is
      a small piece of data inserted by an application initiating the
      session, and utilized by an application accepting the session.  The
      rules which apply for a specific application are defined by a UUI
      package.  This UUI data is opaque to SIP and its function is
      unrelated to any basic SIP function.  This document defines a new SIP
      header field, User-to-User, to transport UUI data, along with an
      extension mechanism.

DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (dane)
-------------------------------------------------

  "Using Secure DNS to Associate Certificates with Domain Names For
  S/MIME", Paul Hoffman, Jakob Schlyter, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-ietf-dane-smime-02.txt>

      This document describes how to use secure DNS to associate an S/MIME
      user's certificate with the intended domain name, similar to the way
      that DANE (RFC 6698) does for TLS.

  "Secure SMTP using DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)
  TLSA records.", Tony Finch, 2013-02-25, <draft-ietf-dane-smtp-01.txt>

      SMTP has a STARTTLS extension, but (especially in the case of inter-
      domain mail transfer) it only provides very limited security because
      it does not specify how to authenticate the server's certificate.
      This memo specifies how TLSA records in the DNS can be used for
      proper SMTP server authentication.

  "Using DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) TLSA records
  with SRV and MX records.", Tony Finch, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-dane-srv-02.txt>

      The DANE specification [RFC6698] describes how to use TLSA resource
      records in the DNS to associate a server's host name with its TLS
      certificate.  The association is secured with DNSSEC.  Some
      application protocols can use SRV records [RFC2782] to indirectly
      name the server hosts for a service domain.  (SMTP uses MX records
      for the same purpose.)  This specification gives generic instructions
      for how these application protocols locate and use TLSA records.
      Separate documents give the details that are specific to particular
      application protocols.

Dynamic Host Configuration (dhc)
--------------------------------

  "Guidelines for Creating New DHCPv6 Options", David Hankins, Tomek
  Mrugalski, Marcin Siodelski, Sheng Jiang, Suresh Krishnan, 2013-07-30,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-option-guidelines-13.txt>

      This document provides guidance to prospective DHCPv6 Option
      developers to help them creating option formats that are easily
      adoptable by existing DHCPv6 software.  This document updates
      RFC3315.

  "Container Option for Server Configuration", Ralph Droms, Reinaldo
  Penno, 2013-04-08, <draft-ietf-dhc-container-opt-07.txt>

      In some DHCP service deployments, it is desirable for a DHCP server
      in one administrative domain to pass configuration options to a DHCP
      server in a different administrative domain.  This DHCP option
      carries a set of DHCP options that can be used by another DHCP
      server.

  "Prefix Assignment in DHCPv6", Sheng Jiang, Frank Xia, Behcet Sarikaya,
  2013-02-25, <draft-ietf-dhc-host-gen-id-05.txt>

      This document introduces a generic host-oriented prefix assignment
      mechanism using DHCPv6.  In this new address configuration procedure,
      the prefix is assigned from a DHCPv6 server to hosts through DHCPv6
      message exchanging while the interface identifiers are independently
      generated by the hosts.  It enables both integral address assignment
      and self-generated addresses in one single mechanism, DHCPv6.  It
      also enables stateless address configuration without RA attendance.
      The technique described in this document can be used in networks
      which assign IPv6 addresses using DHCPv6, e.g.  WiMAX.

  "DHCPv6 Failover Requirements", Tomek Mrugalski, Kim Kinnear,
  2013-07-19, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-requirements-07.txt>

      The DHCPv6 protocol, defined in [RFC3315] allows for multiple servers
      to operate on a single network, however it does not define any way
      the servers could share information about currently active clients
      and their leases.  Some sites are interested in running multiple
      servers in such a way as to provide increased availability in case of
      server failure.  In order for this to work reliably, the cooperating
      primary and secondary servers must maintain a consistent database of
      the lease information.  [RFC3315] allows for but does not define any
      redundancy or failover mechanisms.  This document outlines
      requirements for DHCPv6 failover, enumerates related problems, and
      discusses the proposed scope of work to be conducted.  This document
      does not define a DHCPv6 failover protocol.

  "DHCPv4 over IPv6 Transport", Yong Cui, Peng Wu, Jianping Wu, Ted Lemon,
  2013-03-20, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6-06.txt>

      In IPv6 networks, there remains a need to provide IPv4 service for
      some residual devices.  This document describes a mechanism for
      allocating IPv4 addresses to such devices, using DHCPv4 with an IPv6
      transport.  It is done by putting a special relay agent function
      (Client Relay Agent) on the client side, as well as extending the
      behavior of the server; in the case where DHCP server only supports
      IPv4 transport, a relay agent is extended to support IPv6 transport
      (IPv6-Transport Relay Agent) and relay DHCP traffic for the server,
      with a new Relay Agent Information sub-option added to carry the IPv6
      address of the Client Relay Agent.

  "RADIUS Option for DHCPv6 Relay Agent",  leaf.yeh.sdo@gmail.com, Mohamed
  Boucadair, 2013-07-29, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-radius-opt-14.txt>

      The DHCPv6 RADIUS option provides a mechanism to exchange
      authorization and identification information between DHCPv6 relay
      agent and DHCPv6 server.  This architecture assumes that the Network
      Access Server(NAS) acts as both DHCPv6 relay agent and RADIUS client.
      When receiving messages from the DHCPv6 clients, the NAS consults the
      RADIUS server and adds the RADIUS response when forwarding the DHCPv6
      client's messages to the DHCPv6 server.  The DHCPv6 server then uses
      that additional information to generate appropriate response to the
      DHCPv6 client's requests.

  "Issues with multiple stateful DHCPv6 options", Ole Troan, Bernie Volz,
  2013-05-13, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-stateful-issues-04.txt>

      Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) was not written
      with the expectation that additional stateful DHCPv6 options would be
      developed.  IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration
      Protocol (DHCP) version 6 shoe-horned the new options for Prefix
      Delegation into DHCPv6.  Implementation experience of the CPE model
      described in [RFC6204] has shown multiple issues with the DHCPv6
      protocol in supporting multiple stateful options.

  "A Generic IPv6 Addresses Registration Solution Using DHCPv6", Sheng
  Jiang, Gang Chen, Suresh Krishnan, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-addr-registration-02.txt>

      In networks that are centrally managed, self-generated addresses
      cause traceability issues due to their decentralized nature.  To
      minimize the issues due to lack of traceability, these self-generated
      addresses can be registered with the network for allowing centralized
      address administration.  This document defines a generic address
      registration solution using DHCPv6, using a new ND option and a new
      DHCPv6 option in order to communicate the use of self-generated
      addresses.  A new Addr-registration-request message type is defined
      for initiate the address registration request, among with two new
      Status codes to indicate registration errors on the server side.

  "DHCPv6 Failover Design", Tomek Mrugalski, Kim Kinnear, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-design-03.txt>

      DHCPv6 defined in [RFC3315] does not offer server redundancy.  This
      document defines a design for DHCPv6 failover, a mechanism for
      running two servers on the same network with capability for either
      server to take over clients' leases in case of server failure or
      network partition.  This is a DHCPv6 Failover design document, it is
      not protocol specification document.  It is a second document in a
      planned series of three documents.  DHCPv6 failover requirements are
      specified in [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-requirements].  A protocol
      specification document is planned to follow this document.

  "Prefix Pool Option for DHCPv6 Relay Agent on the Provider Edge
  Routers",  leaf.yeh.sdo@gmail.com, Ted Lemon, Mohamed Boucadair,
  2013-04-25, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-prefix-pool-opt-03.txt>

      The DHCPv6 Prefix Pool option provides a mechanism for DHCPv6 Prefix
      Delegation (DHCPv6-PD), allowing the DHCPv6 server to notify a DHCPv6
      relay agent implemented on a Provider Edge (PE) router about active
      prefix pools allocated by the DHCPv6 server to the PE router.  The
      information of active prefix pools can be used to enforce IPv6 route
      aggregation on the PE router through adding or removing aggregation
      routes according to the status of the prefix pools.  The advertising
      of the aggregation routes in the routing protocol enabled on the
      network-facing interface of PE routers will dramatically decreases
      the number of the routing table entries in the ISP network.

  "Modification to Default Values of SOL_MAX_RT and INF_MAX_RT", Ralph
  Droms, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-solmaxrt-update-02.txt>

      This document updates RFC 3315 by redefining the default values for
      SOL_MAX_RT and INF_MAX_RT, and defining options through which a
      DHCPv6 server can override the client's default value for SOL_MAX_RT
      and INF_MAX_RT with a new value.

  "Populating the DNS Reverse Tree for DHCP Delegated Prefixes", Ted
  Lemon, 2013-03-11, <draft-ietf-dhc-dns-pd-00.txt>

      This document describes three alternatives for populating the DNS
      reverse tree for prefixes delegated using DHCP, and provides
      mechanisms for implementing each alternative.

  "Customizing DHCP Configuration on the Basis of Network Topology", Ted
  Lemon, 2013-04-13, <draft-lemon-dhc-topo-conf-01.txt>

      DHCP servers have evolved over the years to provide significant
      functionality beyond that which is described in the DHCP base
      specifications.  One aspect of this functionality is support for
      context-specific configuration information.  This memo describes some
      such features and makes recommendations as to how they can be used.

  "Handling Unknown DHCPv6 Messages", Yong Cui, Qi Sun, Ted Lemon,
  2013-06-26, <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-unknown-msg-01.txt>

      Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) isn't specific
      about handling messages with unknown types.  This memo describes the
      problems and defines how a DHCPv6 function node should behave in this
      case.  This document updates RFC3315.

  "DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Transport", Qi Sun, Yong Cui, Marcin Siodelski,
  Suresh Krishnan, Ian Farrer, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6-01.txt>

      This document describes a mechanism for obtaining IPv4 address and
      other parameters in IPv6 networks by carrying DHCPv4 messages over
      DHCPv6 transport.

  "Provisioning IPv4 Configuration Over IPv6 Only Networks", Branimir
  Rajtar, Ian Farrer, 2013-05-28, <draft-ietf-dhc-v4configuration-01.txt>

      As IPv6 becomes more widely adopted, some service providers are
      taking the approach of deploying IPv6 only networks, without dual-
      stack functionality for IPv4.  However, access to IPv4 based services
      is still an ongoing requirement and approaches such as IPv4-in-IPv6
      softwire tunnels are being developed to meet this need.
      
      In order to provision end-user's hosts with the necessary IPv4
      configuration, a number of different mechanisms have been proposed.
      This memo discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each, with the aim
      of recommending a single approach as the basis for future work.

  "Access-Network-Identifier Option in DHCP", Cisco Systems, Sri
  Gundavelli, Jouni Korhonen, Mark Grayson, 2013-05-14,
  <draft-ietf-dhc-access-network-identifier-00.txt>

      This document specifies the format and mechanism that is to be used
      for encoding access network identifiers in DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 messages
      by defining new access network identifier options and sub-options.

Diameter Maintenance and Extensions (dime)
------------------------------------------

  "Diameter Applications Design Guidelines", Lionel Morand, Victor
  Fajardo, Hannes Tschofenig, 2013-06-26,
  <draft-ietf-dime-app-design-guide-19.txt>

      The Diameter base protocol provides facilities for protocol
      extensibility enabling to define new Diameter applications or modify
      existing applications.  This document is a companion document to the
      Diameter Base protocol that further explains and clarifies the rules
      to extend Diameter.  It is meant as a guidelines document and
      therefore as informative in nature.

  "Realm-Based Redirection In Diameter", Tina Tsou, Ruibing Hao, Tom
  Taylor, 2013-07-29, <draft-ietf-dime-realm-based-redirect-10.txt>

      The Diameter protocol allows a Diameter redirect agent to return to
      the message sender one or more individual hosts as destinations of
      the redirected message.  However, in some circumstances an operator
      may wish to redirect messages to an alternate domain without
      specifying individual hosts.  This document specifies a mechanism by
      which this can be achieved.  New applications may incorporate this
      capability by reference to the present document.
      
      This memo updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of RFC6733 with respect to
      the usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time
      AVPs.

  "Diameter Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6 Localized Routing", Glen Zorn,
  Wenson Wu, Jouni Korhonen, 2012-08-01, <draft-ietf-dime-pmip6-lr-18.txt>

      In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the
      Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically
      tunneled to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing.  The term
      "localized routing" refers to a method by which packets are routed
      directly between an MN's MAG and the MAG of its Correspondent Node
      (CN) without involving any LMA.  In a Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployment,
      it may be desirable to control the establishment of localized routing
      sessions between two MAGs in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain by requiring
      that the session be authorized.  This document specifies how to
      accomplish this using the Diameter protocol.

  "Diameter Network Access Server Application", Glen Zorn, 2013-05-13,
  <draft-ietf-dime-rfc4005bis-13.txt>

      This document describes the Diameter protocol application used for
      Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) services in the
      Network Access Server (NAS) environment; it obsoletes RFC 4005.  When
      combined with the Diameter Base protocol, Transport Profile, and
      Extensible Authentication Protocol specifications, this application
      specification satisfies typical network access services requirements.

  "Diameter Group Signaling", Mark Jones, Marco Liebsch, Lionel Morand,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-dime-group-signaling-01.txt>

      In large network deployments, a single Diameter peer can support over
      a million concurrent Diameter sessions.  Recent use cases have
      revealed the need for Diameter peers to apply the same operation to a
      large group of Diameter sessions concurrently.  The Diameter base
      protocol commands operate on a single session so these use cases
      could result in many thousands of command exchanges to enforce the
      same operation on each session in the group.  In order to reduce
      signaling, it would be desirable to enable bulk operations on all (or
      part of) the sessions managed by a Diameter peer using a single or a
      few command exchanges.  This document specifies the Diameter protocol
      extensions to achieve this signaling optimization.

  "Diameter Overload Control Requirements", Eric McMurry, Ben Campbell,
  2013-07-28, <draft-ietf-dime-overload-reqs-10.txt>

      When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be
      able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to
      reduce sending traffic for some period of time.  Otherwise, it must
      continue to expend resources parsing and responding to Diameter
      messages, possibly resulting in congestion collapse.  The existing
      Diameter mechanisms, listed in Section 4 are not sufficient for this
      purpose.  This document describes the limitations of the existing
      mechanisms in Section 5.  Requirements for new overload management
      mechanisms are provided in Section 7.

Distributed Mobility Management (dmm)
-------------------------------------

  "Requirements for Distributed Mobility Management", Anthony Chan, Dapeng
  Liu, Pierrick Seite, Hidetoshi Yokota, Jouni Korhonen, 2013-08-02,
  <draft-ietf-dmm-requirements-07.txt,.pdf>

      This document defines the requirements for Distributed Mobility
      Management (DMM) in IPv6 deployments.  The hierarchical structure in
      traditional wireless networks has led to deployment models which are
      in practice centralized.  Mobility management with logically
      centralized mobility anchoring in current mobile networks is prone to
      suboptimal routing and raises scalability issues.  Such centralized
      functions can lead to single points of failure and inevitably
      introduce longer delays and higher signaling loads for network
      operations related to mobility management.  The objective is to
      enhance mobility management in order to meet the primary goals in
      network evolution, i.e., improve scalability, avoid single points of
      failure, enable transparent mobility support to upper layers only
      when needed, and so on.  Distributed mobility management must be
      secure and may co-exist with existing network deployments and end
      hosts.

  "Distributed Mobility Management: Current practices and gap analysis",
  Dapeng Liu, Juan Zuniga, Pierrick Seite, Anthony Chan, Carlos Bernardos,
  2013-06-17, <draft-ietf-dmm-best-practices-gap-analysis-01.txt>

      The present document analyses deplyment practices of existing
      mobility protocols in a distributed mobility management environment.
      It also identifies some limitations compared to the expected
      functionality of a fully distributed mobility management system.  The
      comparison is made taking into account the identified DMM
      requirements.

Domain Name System Operations (dnsop)
-------------------------------------

  "Initializing a DNS Resolver with Priming Queries", Peter Koch, Matt
  Larson, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-dnsop-resolver-priming-03.txt>

      This document describes the initial queries a DNS resolver is
      supposed to emit to initialize its cache with a current NS RRSet for
      the root zone as well as the necessary address information.

Data for Reachability of Inter/tra-NetworK SIP (drinks)
-------------------------------------------------------

  "Session Peering Provisioning (SPP) Protocol over SOAP", Kenneth
  Cartwright, Vikas Bhatia, Jean-Francois Mule, Alexander Mayrhofer,
  2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-drinks-spp-protocol-over-soap-04.txt>

      The Session Peering Provisioning Framework (SPPF) specifies the data
      model and the overall structure to provision session establishment
      data into Session Data Registries and SIP Service Provider data
      stores.  To utilize this framework one needs a transport protocol.
      Given that Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is currently widely
      used for messaging between elements of such provisioning systems,
      this document specifies the usage of SOAP (via HTTPS) as the
      transport protocol for SPPF.  The benefits include leveraging
      prevalent expertise, and a higher probability that existing
      provisioning systems will be able to easily migrate to using an SPPF
      based protocol.

  "Session Peering Provisioning Framework (SPPF)", Kenneth Cartwright,
  Vikas Bhatia, Syed Ali, David Schwartz, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-drinks-spp-framework-05.txt>

      This document specifies the data model and the overall structure for
      a framework to provision session establishment data into Session Data
      Registries and SIP Service Provider data stores.  The framework is
      called the Session Peering Provisioning Framework (SPPF).  The
      provisioned data is typically used by network elements for session
      establishment.

Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group (dtnrg)
------------------------------------------------

  "Delay Tolerant Networking TCP Convergence Layer Protocol", Michael
  Demmer, Joerg Ott, Simon Perreault, 2013-05-17,
  <draft-irtf-dtnrg-tcp-clayer-06.txt>

      This document describes the protocol for the TCP-based Convergence
      Layer for Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN).

  "Bundle Protocol Extended Class Of Service (ECOS)", Scott Burleigh,
  2013-07-01, <draft-irtf-dtnrg-ecos-05.txt>

      This document describes an extension to the Delay-Tolerant Networking
      (DTN) Bundle Protocol (BP) that marks bundles with class-of-service
      designators beyond those defined for the BP primary block.  The
      extended class-of-service designators are an "ordinal" number that
      provides fine-grained prioritization of bundles, a "critical" flag,
      flags that explicitly request "timely" or "assured" convergence-layer
      transmission (or both), and an optional flow label.

  "Datagram Convergence Layers for the DTN Bundle and LTP Protocols", Hans
  Kruse, Samuel Jero, Shawn Ostermann, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-irtf-dtnrg-dgram-clayer-04.txt>

      This document is a product of the Delay- and Distruption-Tolerant
      Networking Research Group (DTNRG), and represents the consensus of
      the DTNRG.  It specifies the preferred method for transporting Delay-
      and Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocol data over the
      Internet using datagrams.  The specification covers convergence
      layers for the Bundle Protocol (RFC 5050) as well as the
      transportation of Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) (RFC 5326)
      segments.  UDP and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)
      are the candidate datagram protocols discussed.  UDP can only be used
      on a local network, or in cases where the DTN node implements
      explicit congestion control.  DCCP addresses the congestion control
      problem, and its use is recommended whenever possible.

  "Streamlined Bundle Security Protocol Specification", Edward Birrane,
  2013-07-14, <draft-irtf-dtnrg-sbsp-00.txt>

      This document defines a streamlined bundle security protocol, which
      provides data authentication, integrity, and confidentiality services
      for the Bundle Protocol.  Capabilities are provided to protect the
      bundle payload, and additional data that may be included within the
      bundle, along a single path through a network.

Emergency Context Resolution with Internet Technologies (ecrit)
---------------------------------------------------------------

  "Trustworthy Location", Hannes Tschofenig, Henning Schulzrinne, Bernard
  Aboba, 2013-07-30, <draft-ietf-ecrit-trustworthy-location-07.txt>

      For some location-based applications, such as emergency calling or
      roadside assistance, the trustworthiness of location information is
      critically important.
      
      This document describes how to convey location in a manner that is
      inherently secure and reliable.  It also provides guidelines for
      assessing the trustworthiness of location information.

  "Extensions to the Emergency Services Architecture for dealing with
  Unauthenticated and Unauthorized Devices", Henning Schulzrinne, Stephen
  McCann, Gabor Bajko, Hannes Tschofenig, Dirk Kroeselberg, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-ietf-ecrit-unauthenticated-access-07.txt>

      The IETF emergency services architecture assumes that the calling
      device has acquired rights to use the access network or that no
      authentication is required for the access network, such as for public
      wireless access points.  Subsequent protocol interactions, such as
      obtaining location information, learning the address of the Public
      Safety Answering Point (PSAP) and the emergency call itself are
      largely decoupled from the underlying network access procedures.
      
      In some cases, however, the device does not have these credentials
      for network access, does not have a VoIP service provider, or the
      credentials have become invalid, e.g., because the user has exhausted
      their prepaid balance or the account has expired.
      
      This document provides a problem statement, introduces terminology
      and describes an extension for the base IETF emergency services
      architecture to address these scenarios.

  "Data-Only Emergency Calls", Brian Rosen, Henning Schulzrinne, Hannes
  Tschofenig, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-ecrit-data-only-ea-06.txt>

      RFC 6443 'Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia'
      describes how devices use the Internet to place emergency calls and
      how Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) can handle Internet
      multimedia emergency calls natively.  The exchange of multimedia
      traffic typically involves a SIP session establishment starting with
      a SIP INVITE that negotiates various parameters for that session.
      
      In some cases, however, the transmission of application data is
      everything that is needed.  Examples of such environments include a
      temperature sensors issuing alerts, or vehicles sending crash data.
      Often these alerts are conveyed as one-shot data transmissions.
      These type of interactions are called 'data-only emergency calls'.
      This document describes a container for the data based on the Common
      Alerting Protocol (CAP) and its transmission using the SIP MESSAGE
      transaction.

  "Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) Callback", Henning Schulzrinne,
  Hannes Tschofenig, Christer Holmberg, Milan Patel, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-ietf-ecrit-psap-callback-10.txt>

      After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated
      by the emergency caller or normally by the call taker) it is possible
      that the call taker feels the need for further communication.  For
      example, the call may have been dropped by accident without the call
      taker having sufficient information about the current situation of a
      wounded person.  A call taker may trigger a callback towards the
      emergency caller using the contact information provided with the
      initial emergency call.  This callback could, under certain
      circumstances, be treated like any other call and as a consequence it
      may get blocked by authorization policies or may get forwarded to an
      answering machine.
      
      The IETF emergency services architecture specification already offers
      a solution approach for allowing PSAP callbacks to bypass
      authorization policies to reach the caller without unnecessary
      delays.  Unfortunately, the specified mechanism only supports limited
      scenarios.  This document discusses shortcomings of the current
      mechanisms and illustrates additional scenarios where better-than-
      normal call treatment behavior would be desirable.  A solution based
      on a new header field value, called "psap-callback", for the SIP
      Priority header field is specified to accomplish the PSAP callback
      marking.

  "Additional Data related to an Emergency Call", Brian Rosen, Hannes
  Tschofenig, Roger Marshall, Randy, James Winterbottom, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-ietf-ecrit-additional-data-11.txt>

      When an emergency call is sent to a Public Safety Answering Point
      (PSAP), the device that sends it, as well as any application service
      provider in the path of the call, or access network provider through
      which the call originated may have information about the call, the
      caller or the location which the PSAP may be able to use.  This
      document describes data structures and a mechanism to convey such
      data to the PSAP.  The mechanism uses a Uniform Resource Identifier
      (URI), which may point to either an external resource or an object in
      the body of the SIP message.  The mechanism thus allows the data to
      be passed by reference (when the URI points to an external resource)
      or by value (when it points into the body of the message).  This
      follows the tradition of prior emergency services standardization
      work where data can be conveyed by value within the call signaling
      (i.e., in body of the SIP message) and also by reference.

  "Policy for defining new service-identifying lables", Andrea Forte,
  Henning Schulzrinne, 2013-06-20,
  <draft-ietf-ecrit-service-urn-policy-02.txt>

      In order to provide location-based services, descriptive terms for
      services need to be defined.  This document updates the policy for
      defining new service-identifying labels.

  "URN For Country Specific Emergency Services", Christer Holmberg, Ivo
  Sedlacek, 2013-04-29, <draft-ietf-ecrit-country-emg-urn-00.txt>

      This document updates section 4.2 of RFC 5031, in order to allow the
      registration of service URNs with the 'sos' service type for
      emergency services that, at the time of registration, are offered in
      one country only.

Energy Management (eman)
------------------------

  "Requirements for Energy Management", Juergen Quittek, Mouli
  Chandramouli, Rolf Winter, Thomas Dietz, Benoit Claise, 2013-05-02,
  <draft-ietf-eman-requirements-14.txt>

      This document defines requirements for standards specifications for
      energy management.  The requirements defined in this document concern
      monitoring functions as well as control functions.  Monitoring
      functions include identification of energy-managed devices and their
      components, monitoring of their power states, power inlets, power
      outlets, actual power (the instantaneous power, as opposed to the
      demand, which is an averaged power), power attributes, received
      energy, provided energy, and contained batteries.  Control functions
      serve for controlling power supply and power state of energy-managed
      devices and their components.
      This document does not specify the features that must be implemented
      by compliant implementations but rather features that must be
      supported by standards for energy management.

  "Energy Management Framework", Benoit Claise, John Parello, Brad
  Schoening, Juergen Quittek, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-ietf-eman-framework-08.txt>

      This document defines a framework for providing Energy
      Management for devices and device components within or
      connected to communication networks.  The framework defines an
      Energy Management Domain as a set of Energy Objects. Each
      Energy Object is identified, classified and given context.
      Energy Objects can be monitored and controlled with respect to
      Power, Power State, Energy, Demand, Power Attributes, and
      Battery.  Additionally the framework models relationships and
      capabilities between Energy Objects.

  "Energy Object Context MIB", John Parello, Benoit Claise, Mouli
  Chandramouli, 2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-eman-energy-aware-mib-09.txt>

      This document defines a subset of a Management Information Base
      (MIB) for energy management of devices. The module addresses
      device identification, context information, and the
      relationships between reporting devices, remote devices, and
      monitoring devices.

  "Definition of Managed Objects for Battery Monitoring", Juergen Quittek,
  Rolf Winter, Thomas Dietz, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-eman-battery-mib-09.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
      In particular, it defines managed objects that provide information on
      the status of batteries in managed devices.

  "Power and Energy Monitoring MIB", Mouli Chandramouli, Brad Schoening,
  Juergen Quittek, Thomas Dietz, Benoit Claise, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-eman-energy-monitoring-mib-06.txt>

      This document defines a subset of the Management Information
      Base (MIB) for power and energy monitoring of devices.

  "Energy Management (EMAN) Applicability Statement", Brad Schoening,
  Mouli Chandramouli, Bruce Nordman, 2013-04-18,
  <draft-ietf-eman-applicability-statement-03.txt>

      The objective of Energy Management (EMAN) is to provide an
      energy management framework for networked devices.  This
      document presents the applicability of the EMAN framework to a
      variety of scenarios.  This document lists use cases and target
      devices that can potentially implement the EMAN framework and
      associated SNMP MIB modules.  These use cases are useful for
      identifying requirements for the framework and MIBs.  Further,
      we describe the relationship of the EMAN framework to relevant
      other energy monitoring standards and architectures.

EAP Method Update (emu)
-----------------------

  "Tunnel EAP Method (TEAP) Version 1", Hao Zhou, Nancy Cam-Winget, Joseph
  Salowey, Stephen Hanna, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-emu-eap-tunnel-method-07.txt>

      This document defines the Tunnel Extensible Authentication Protocol
      (TEAP) version 1.  TEAP is a tunnel based EAP method that enables
      secure communication between a peer and a server by using the
      Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to establish a mutually
      authenticated tunnel.  Within the tunnel, Type-Length-Value (TLV)
      objects are used to convey authentication related data between the
      EAP peer and the EAP server.

  "EAP Mutual Cryptographic Binding", Sam Hartman, Margaret Wasserman,
  Dacheng Zhang, 2013-07-10, <draft-ietf-emu-crypto-bind-04.txt>

      As the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) evolves, EAP peers
      rely increasingly on information received from the EAP server.  EAP
      extensions such as channel binding or network posture information are
      often carried in tunnel methods; peers are likely to rely on this
      information.  RFC 3748 is a facility that protects tunnel methods
      against man-in-the-middle attacks.  However, cryptographic binding
      focuses on protecting the server rather than the peer.  This memo
      explores attacks possible when the peer is not protected from man-in-
      the-middle attacks and recommends mutual cryptographic binding, a new
      form of cryptographic binding that protects both peer and server
      along with other mitigations.

Forwarding and Control Element Separation (forces)
--------------------------------------------------

  "ForCES Intra-NE High Availability", Kentaro Ogawa, Weiming Wang,
  Evangelos Haleplidis, Jamal Hadi Salim, 2013-05-08,
  <draft-ietf-forces-ceha-07.txt>

      This document discusses Control Element High Availability within a
      ForCES Network Element.

  "Interoperability Report for Forwarding and Control Element Separation
  (ForCES)", Weiming Wang, Kentaro Ogawa, Evangelos Haleplidis, Ming Gao,
  Jamal Hadi Salim, 2013-06-02, <draft-ietf-forces-interop-09.txt>

      This document captures results of the second Forwarding and Control
      Element Separation (ForCES) interoperability test which took place on
      February 24-25, 2011 in the Internet Technology Lab (ITL) of Zhejiang
      Gongshang University, China.  RFC 6053 reported the results of the
      first ForCES interoperability test, and this document updates RFC
      6053 by providing further interoperability results.

General Area (gen)
------------------

  "Experiences from Cross-Area Work at the IETF", Jari Arkko, 2013-02-06,
  <draft-arkko-iesg-crossarea-03.txt>

      This memo discusses the reasons for IETF work on topics that cross
      area boundaries.  Such cross-area work presents challenges for the
      organization of the IETF as well as on how interested parties can
      participate the work.  The memo also provides some suggestions on
      managing these challenges.

  "IMAP Access to IETF Email List Archives", Robert Sparks, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-sparks-genarea-imaparch-08.txt>

      The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work.  This
      often involves accessing the archived history of those email lists.
      Participants would like to have the ability to browse and search
      those archives using standard IMAP clients.  This memo captures the
      requirements for providing a service that would allow such browsing
      and searching, and it is intended as input to a later activity for
      the design and development of such a service.

  "Process Experiment: Document Shepherding Throughout a Document's
  Lifecycle", Barry Leiba, 2013-07-10,
  <draft-leiba-extended-doc-shepherd-02.txt>

      RFC 4858 talks about "Document Shepherding from Working Group Last
      Call to Publication".  There's a significant part of a document's
      life that happens before working group last call, starting, really,
      at the time a working group begins discussing a version of the idea
      that's been posted as an individual draft.  It seems reasonable and
      helpful in many situations to begin shepherding when there's a call
      for adoption as a working group document.  This document extends RFC
      4858, describing how that extended shepherding function might work
      and what tasks might be involved throughout the document's lifecycle,
      and suggesting how Working Group Chairs might choose to implement
      extended shepherding.

  "The Internet Numbers Registry System", Russ Housley, John Curran, Geoff
  Huston, David Conrad, 2013-07-01, <draft-housley-rfc2050bis-02.txt>

      This document provides information about the current Internet Numbers
      Registry System used in the distribution of globally unique Internet
      Protocol (IP) address space and autonomous system (AS) numbers.
      
      This document also provides information about the processes for
      further evolution of the Internet Numbers Registry System.
      
      This document replaces RFC 2050.
      
      This document does not propose any changes to the current Internet
      Numbers Registry System.  Rather it documents the Internet Numbers
      Registry System as it works today.

  "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) IPv4 and IPv6 Option for a
  Location Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)", James Polk, 2013-02-24,
  <draft-ietf-geopriv-dhcp-lbyr-uri-option-19.txt>

      This document creates a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
      Option for transmitting a client's geolocation Uniform Resource
      Identifier (URI). This Location URI can then be dereferenced in a
      separate transaction by the client or sent to another entity and
      dereferenced to learn physically where the client is located, but
      only while valid.

  "Relative Location Representation", Martin Thomson, Brian Rosen, Dorothy
  Stanley, Gabor Bajko, Allan Thomson, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-geopriv-relative-location-06.txt>

      This document defines an extension to PIDF-LO (RFC4119) for the
      expression of location information that is defined relative to a
      reference point.  The reference point may be expressed as a geodetic
      or civic location, and the relative offset may be one of several
      shapes.  An alternative binary representation is described.
      
      Optionally, a reference to a secondary document (such as a map image)
      can be included, along with the relationship of the map coordinate
      system to the reference/offset coordinate system to allow display of
      the map with the reference point and the relative offset.

  "Using Device-provided Location-Related Measurements in Location
  Configuration Protocols", Martin Thomson, James Winterbottom,
  2013-06-24, <draft-ietf-geopriv-held-measurements-08.txt>

      This document describes a protocol for a Device to provide location-
      related measurement data to a Location Information Server (LIS)
      within a request for location information.  Location-related
      measurement information are observations concerning properties
      related to the position of a Device, which could be data about
      network attachment or about the physical environment.  A LIS is able
      to use the location-related measurement data to improve the accuracy
      of the location estimate it provides to the Device.  A basic set of
      location-related measurements are defined, including common modes of
      network attachment as well as assisted Global Navigation Satellite
      System (GNSS) parameters.

  "Location Configuration Extensions for Policy Management", Richard
  Barnes, Martin Thomson, James Winterbottom, Hannes Tschofenig,
  2012-10-04, <draft-ietf-geopriv-policy-uri-07.txt>

      Current location configuration protocols are capable of provisioning
      an Internet host with a location URI that refers to the host's
      location.  These protocols lack a mechanism for the target host to
      inspect or set the privacy rules that are applied to the URIs they
      distribute.  This document extends the current location configuration
      protocols to provide hosts with a reference to the rules that are
      applied to a URI, so that the host can view or set these rules.

  "Location Information Server (LIS) Discovery using IP address and
  Reverse DNS", Martin Thomson, Ray Bellis, 2013-04-05,
  <draft-ietf-geopriv-res-gw-lis-discovery-05.txt>

      The residential gateway is a device that has become an integral part
      of home networking equipment.  Discovering a Location Information
      Server (LIS) is a necessary part of acquiring location information
      for location-based services.  However, discovering a LIS when a
      residential gateway is present poses a configuration challenge,
      requiring a method that is able to work around the obstacle presented
      by the gateway.
      
      This document describes a solution to this problem.  The solution
      provides alternative domain names as input to the LIS discovery
      process based on the network addresses assigned to a Device.

Global Routing Operations (grow)
--------------------------------

  "Route-Leaks & MITM Attacks Against BGPSEC", Danny McPherson, Shane
  Amante, Eric Osterweil, Dave Mitchell, 2013-08-01,
  <draft-ietf-grow-simple-leak-attack-bgpsec-no-help-02.txt>

      This document describes a very simple attack vector that illustrates
      how RPKI-enabled BGPSEC machinery as currently defined can be easily
      circumvented in order to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack via
      BGP.  It is meant to serve as input to the IETF's Global Routing
      Operations Working group (GROW) during routing security requirements
      discussions and subsequent specification.

  "IRR & Routing Policy Configuration Considerations", Danny McPherson,
  Shane Amante, Eric Osterweil, Larry Blunk, Dave Mitchell, 2013-05-10,
  <draft-ietf-grow-irr-routing-policy-considerations-01.txt>

      The purpose of this document is to catalog past issues influencing
      the efficacy of Internet Routing Registries (IRR) for inter-domain
      routing policy specification and application in the global routing
      system over the past two decades.  Additionally, it provides a
      discussion regarding which of these issues are still problematic in
      practice, and which are simply artifacts that are no longer
      applicable but continue to stifle inter-provider policy-based
      filtering adoption and IRR utility to this day.

Host Identity Protocol (hip)
----------------------------

  "Host Identity Protocol-Based Overlay Networking Environment (HIP BONE)
  Instance Specification for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD)",
  Ari Keranen, Gonzalo Camarillo, Jouni Maenpaa, 2013-06-10,
  <draft-ietf-hip-reload-instance-08.txt>

      This document is the Host Identity Protocol-Based Overlay Networking
      Environment (HIP BONE) instance specification for the REsource
      LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) protocol.  The document provides the
      details needed to build a RELOAD-based overlay that uses HIP.

  "An IPv6 Prefix for Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers
  Version 2 (ORCHIDv2)", Julien Laganier, Francis Dupont, 2013-05-06,
  <draft-ietf-hip-rfc4843-bis-04.txt>

      This document specifies an updated Overlay Routable Cryptographic
      Hash Identifiers format that obsoletes the earlier format defined in
      [RFC4843].  These identifiers are intended to be used as endpoint
      identifiers at applications and Application Programming Interfaces
      (API) and not as identifiers for network location at the IP layer,
      i.e., locators.  They are designed to appear as application layer
      entities and at the existing IPv6 APIs, but they should not appear in
      actual IPv6 headers.  To make them more like regular IPv6 addresses,
      they are expected to be routable at an overlay level.  Consequently,
      while they are considered non-routable addresses from the IPv6 layer
      point-of-view, all existing IPv6 applications are expected to be able
      to use them in a manner compatible with current IPv6 addresses.
      
      The Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers originally
      defined in [RFC4843] lacked a mechanism for cryptographic algorithm
      agility.  The updated ORCHID format specified in this document
      removes this limitation by encoding in the identifier itself an index
      to the suite of cryptographic algorithms in use.

  "Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2)", Robert Moskowitz, Tobias
  Heer, Petri Jokela, Tom Henderson, 2013-06-30,
  <draft-ietf-hip-rfc5201-bis-12.txt>

      This document specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol
      (HIP).  HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and
      maintain shared IP-layer state, allowing separation of the identifier
      and locator roles of IP addresses, thereby enabling continuity of
      communications across IP address changes.  HIP is based on a SIGMA-
      compliant Diffie-Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers
      from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication.
      The protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS)
      and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  When used together with
      another suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulated Security
      Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional
      encryption for upper-layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.
      
      This document obsoletes RFC 5201 and addresses the concerns raised by
      the IESG, particularly that of crypto agility.  It also incorporates
      lessons learned from the implementations of RFC 5201.

  "Host Mobility with the Host Identity Protocol", Tom Henderson,
  Christian Vogt, Jari Arkko, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-hip-rfc5206-bis-06.txt>

      This document defines mobility extensions to the Host Identity
      Protocol (HIP).  Specifically, this document defines a general
      "LOCATOR_SET" parameter for HIP messages that allows for a HIP host
      to notify peers about alternate addresses at which it may be reached.
      This document also defines elements of procedure for mobility of a
      HIP host -- the process by which a host dynamically changes the
      primary locator that it uses to receive packets.  While the same
      LOCATOR_SET parameter can also be used to support end-host
      multihoming, detailed procedures are out of scope for this document.
      This document obsoletes RFC 5206.

  "Native NAT Traversal Mode for the Host Identity Protocol", Ari Keranen,
  Jan Melen, 2013-06-14, <draft-ietf-hip-native-nat-traversal-05.txt>

      This document specifies a new Network Address Translator (NAT)
      traversal mode for the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  The new mode is
      based on the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) methodology
      and UDP encapsulation of data and signaling traffic.  The main
      difference from the previously specified modes is the use of HIP
      messages for all NAT traversal procedures.

  "Using the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) Transport Format with
  the Host Identity Protocol (HIP)", Petri Jokela, Robert Moskowitz, Jan
  Melen, 2013-07-10, <draft-ietf-hip-rfc5202-bis-03.txt>

      This memo specifies an Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) based
      mechanism for transmission of user data packets, to be used with the
      Host Identity Protocol (HIP).

  "Host Multihoming with the Host Identity Protocol", Tom Henderson,
  Christian Vogt, Jari Arkko, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-hip-multihoming-03.txt>

      This document defines host multihoming extensions to the Host
      Identity Protocol (HIP), by leveraging protocol components defined
      for host mobility.

  "Host Identity Protocol Certificates", Tobias Heer, Samu Varjonen,
  2013-04-01, <draft-ietf-hip-rfc6253-bis-00.txt>

      The CERT parameter is a container for digital certificates.  It is
      used for carrying these certificates in Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
      control packets.  This document specifies the certificate parameter
      and the error signaling in case of a failed verification.
      Additionally, this document specifies the representations of Host
      Identity Tags in X.509 version 3 (v3) and SPKI certificates.
      
      The concrete use of certificates including how certificates are
      obtained, requested, and which actions are taken upon successful or
      failed verification are specific to the scenario in which the
      certificates are used.  Hence, the definition of these scenario-
      specific aspects are left to the documents that use the CERT
      parameter.
      
      This document updates RFC 5201.

Host Identity Protocol (hiprg)
------------------------------

  "HIP support for RFIDs", Pascal Urien, Gyu Lee, Guy Pujolle, 2013-04-23,
  <draft-irtf-hiprg-rfid-07.txt>

      This document describes an architecture based on the Host Identity
      Protocol (HIP), for active RFIDs, i.e. Radio Frequency Identifiers
      including tamper resistant computing resources, as specified for
      example in the ISO 14443 or 15693 standards. HIP-RFIDs never expose
      their identity in clear text, but hide this value (typically an EPC-
      Code) by a particular equation that can be only solved by a dedicated
      entity, referred as the portal. HIP exchanges occur between HIP-RFIDs
      and portals; they are transported by IP packets, through the Internet
      cloud.

Home Networking (homenet)
-------------------------

  "Home Networking Architecture for IPv6", Tim Chown, Jari Arkko, Anders
  Brandt, Ole Troan, Jason Weil, 2013-08-01,
  <draft-ietf-homenet-arch-10.txt>

      This text describes evolving networking technology within
      increasingly large residential home networks.  The goal of this
      document is to define a general architecture for IPv6-based home
      networking, describing the associated principles, considerations and
      requirements.  The text briefly highlights specific implications of
      the introduction of IPv6 for home networking, discusses the elements
      of the architecture, and suggests how standard IPv6 mechanisms and
      addressing can be employed in home networking.  The architecture
      describes the need for specific protocol extensions for certain
      additional functionality.  It is assumed that the IPv6 home network
      is not actively managed, and runs as an IPv6-only or dual-stack
      network.  There are no recommendations in this text for the IPv4 part
      of the network.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Authentication (httpauth)
-----------------------------------------------------

  "HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA)", Stephen Farrell, Paul
  Hoffman, Michael Thomas, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-httpauth-hoba-01.txt>

      HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a design for an HTTP
      authentication method with credentials that are not vulnerable to
      phishing attacks, and that does not require a server-side password
      database.  The design can also be used in Javascript-based
      authentication embedded in HTML.  HOBA is an alternative to HTTP
      authentication schemes that require passwords with all the negative
      attributes that come with password-based systems.

  "An Encoding Parameter for HTTP Basic Authentication", Julian Reschke,
  2013-06-30, <draft-ietf-httpauth-basicauth-enc-01.txt>

      The "Basic" authentication scheme defined in RFC 2617 does not
      properly define how to treat non-ASCII characters.  This has led to a
      situation where user agent implementations disagree, and servers make
      different assumptions based on the locales they are running in.
      There is little interoperability for the non-ASCII characters in the
      ISO-8859-1 character repertoire, and even less interoperability for
      any characters beyond that.
      
      This document defines a backwards-compatible extension to "Basic",
      specifying the server's character encoding scheme expectation, using
      a new authentication scheme parameter.

  "HTTP Digest Update", Rifaat Shekh-Yusef, David Ahrens, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-ietf-httpauth-digest-update-04.txt>

      This documents specifies extensions to the HTTP Digest Authentication
      mechanism to add support for new digest algorithms to the HTTP Digest
      Access Authentication scheme.

  "Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP", Yutaka Oiwa, Hajime Watanabe,
  Hiromitsu Takagi, Boku Kihara, Tatsuya Hayashi, Yuichi Ioku, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-ietf-httpauth-mutual-00.txt,.ps,.pdf>

      This document specifies a mutual authentication method for the Hyper-
      text Transport Protocol (HTTP).  This method provides a true mutual
      authentication between an HTTP client and an HTTP server using
      password-based authentication.  Unlike the Basic and Digest
      authentication methods, the Mutual authentication method specified in
      this document assures the user that the server truly knows the user's
      encrypted password.  This prevents common phishing attacks: a
      phishing attacker controlling a fake website cannot convince a user
      that he authenticated to the genuine website.  Furthermore, even when
      a user authenticates to an illegitimate server, the server cannot
      gain any information about the user's password.  The Mutual
      authentication method is designed as an extension to the HTTP
      protocol, and is intended to replace the existing authentication
      methods used in HTTP (the Basic method, Digest method, and
      authentication using HTML forms).

  "HTTP Authentication Extensions for Interactive Clients", Yutaka Oiwa,
  Hajime Watanabe, Hiromitsu Takagi, Boku Kihara, Tatsuya Hayashi, Yuichi
  Ioku, 2013-07-01, <draft-ietf-httpauth-extension-00.txt,.ps,.pdf>

      This document specifies a few extensions of HTTP authentication
      framework for interactive clients.  Recently, fundamental features of
      HTTP-level authentication is not enough for complex requirements of
      various Web-based applications.  This makes these applications to
      implement their own authentication frameworks using HTML Forms and
      other means, which becomes one of the hurdles against introducing
      secure authentication mechanisms handled jointly by servers and user-
      agent clients.  The extended framework fills gaps between Web
      application requirements and HTTP authentication provisions to solve
      the above problems, while maintaining compatibility against existing
      Web and non-Web uses of HTTP authentications.

  "Salted Challenge Response (SCRAM) HTTP Authentication Mechanism",
  Alexey Melnikov, 2013-07-01, <draft-ietf-httpauth-scram-auth-00.txt>

      The secure authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used by
      Internet application protocols is the transmission of clear-text
      passwords over a channel protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS).
      There are some significant security concerns with that mechanism,
      which could be addressed by the use of a challenge response
      authentication mechanism protected by TLS.  Unfortunately, the HTTP
      Digest challenge response mechanism presently on the standards track
      failed widespread deployment, and have had success only in limited
      use.
      
      This specification describes a family of HTTP authentication
      mechanisms called the Salted Challenge Response Authentication
      Mechanism (SCRAM), which addresses the security concerns and meets
      the deployability requirements.  When used in combination with TLS or
      an equivalent security layer, a mechanism from this family could
      improve the status-quo for application protocol authentication.

  "An Encoding Mechanism for HTTP Digest Authentication", Rifaat
  Shekh-Yusef, 2013-07-07, <draft-ietf-httpauth-digest-encoding-02.txt>

      RFC2617 does not define how to treat Unicode characters [UNICODE]
      outside the ASCII range [RFC20] with the "Digest" scheme.  This
      document defines an extension to the "Digest" scheme, and a mechanism
      that enables the client and server to negotiate their support for the
      UTF-8 [RFC3629] character encoding scheme.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Bis (httpbis)
-----------------------------------------

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Authentication", Roy Fielding,
  Julian Reschke, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-httpbis-p7-auth-23.txt>

      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
      protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
      systems.  This document defines the HTTP Authentication framework.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests", Roy
  Fielding, Julian Reschke, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-p4-conditional-23.txt>

      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
      protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
      systems.  This document defines HTTP/1.1 conditional requests,
      including metadata header fields for indicating state changes,
      request header fields for making preconditions on such state, and
      rules for constructing the responses to a conditional request when
      one or more preconditions evaluate to false.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing",
  Roy Fielding, Julian Reschke, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging-23.txt>

      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
      protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
      systems.  HTTP has been in use by the World Wide Web global
      information initiative since 1990.  This document provides an
      overview of HTTP architecture and its associated terminology, defines
      the "http" and "https" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes,
      defines the HTTP/1.1 message syntax and parsing requirements, and
      describes general security concerns for implementations.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching", Roy Fielding, Mark
  Nottingham, Julian Reschke, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-p6-cache-23.txt>

      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
      protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
      systems.  This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the
      associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate
      cacheable response messages.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content", Roy
  Fielding, Julian Reschke, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics-23.txt>

      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
      protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
      systems.  This document defines the semantics of HTTP/1.1 messages,
      as expressed by request methods, request header fields, response
      status codes, and response header fields, along with the payload of
      messages (metadata and body content) and mechanisms for content
      negotiation.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests", Roy Fielding,
  Yves Lafon, Julian Reschke, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-p5-range-23.txt>

      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
      protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
      systems.  This document defines range requests and the rules for
      constructing and combining responses to those requests.

  "Initial Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Method Registrations",
  Julian Reschke, 2013-02-23,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-method-registrations-11.txt>

      This document registers those Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
      methods which have been defined in standards-track RFCs before the
      IANA HTTP Method Registry was established.

  "Initial Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Scheme
  Registrations", Julian Reschke, 2013-02-23,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-authscheme-registrations-06.txt>

      This document registers Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
      authentication schemes which have been defined in standards-track
      RFCs before the IANA HTTP Authentication Scheme Registry was
      established.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2.0", Mike Belshe, Roberto Peon,
  Martin Thomson, Alexey Melnikov, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-04.txt>

      This specification describes an optimized expression of the syntax of
      the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  The HTTP/2.0 encapsulation
      enables more efficient use of network resources and reduced
      perception of latency by allowing header field compression and
      multiple concurrent messages on the same connection.  It also
      introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to
      clients.
      
      This document is an alternative to, but does not obsolete the
      HTTP/1.1 message format or protocol.  HTTP's existing semantics
      remain unchanged.
      
      This version of the draft has been marked for implementation.
      Interoperability testing will occur in the HTTP/2.0 interim in
      Hamburg, DE, starting 2013-08-05.

  "HTTP/2.0 Header Compression", Roberto Peon, Herve Ruellan, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-ietf-httpbis-header-compression-01.txt>

      This document describes a format adapted to efficiently represent
      HTTP headers in the context of HTTP/2.0.

BiDirectional or Server-Initiated HTTP (hybi)
---------------------------------------------

  "A Multiplexing Extension for WebSockets", John Tamplin, Takeshi
  Yoshino, 2013-07-02, <draft-ietf-hybi-websocket-multiplexing-11.txt>

      The WebSocket Protocol [RFC6455] requires a new transport connection
      for every WebSocket connection.  This presents a scalability problem
      when many clients connect to the same server, and is made worse by
      having multiple clients running in different tabs of the same user
      agent.  This extension provides a way for separate logical WebSocket
      connections to share an underlying transport connection.
      
      Please send feedback to the hybi@ietf.org mailing list.

  "Compression Extensions for WebSocket", Takeshi Yoshino, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-hybi-permessage-compression-12.txt>

      This document specifies a framework for creating WebSocket extensions
      that add compression functionality to the WebSocket Protocol.  An
      extension based on this framework compresses the payload data portion
      of non-control WebSocket messages on a per-message basis using
      parameters negotiated during the opening handshake.  This framework
      provides a general method to apply a compression algorithm to the
      contents of WebSocket messages.  For each compression algorithm, an
      extension is defined by specifying parameter negotiation and
      compression algorithm in detail.  This document also specifies one
      specific compression extension using the DEFLATE algorithm.
      
      Please send feedback to the hybi@ietf.org mailing list.

Interface to the Routing System (i2rs)
--------------------------------------

  "Interface to the Routing System Problem Statement", Alia Atlas, Thomas
  Nadeau, David Ward, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-atlas-i2rs-problem-statement-01.txt>

      As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, the need for rapid
      and dynamic control increases.  With scale, the need to automate even
      the simplest operations is important, but even more critical is the
      ability to quickly interact with more complex operations such as
      policy-based controls.
      
      In order to enable applications to have access to and control over
      information in the Internet's routing system, we need a publicly
      documented interface specification.  The interface needs to support
      real-time, asynchronous interactions using data models and encodings
      that are efficient and potentially different from those available
      today.  Furthermore, the interface must be tailored to support a
      variety of use cases.
      
      This document expands upon these statements of requirements to
      provide a detailed problem statement for an Interface to the Internet
      Routing System (I2RS).

  "Use Cases for an Interface to BGP Protocol", Keyur Patel, Rex Fernando,
  Hannes Gredler, Shane Amante, 2013-03-11,
  <draft-keyupate-i2rs-bgp-usecases-00.txt>

      A network routing protocol like BGP is typically configured and
      results of its operation are analyzed through some form of Command
      Line Interface (CLI) or NETCONF.  These interactions to control BGP
      and diagnose its operation encompass: configuration of protocol
      parameters, display of protocol data, setting of certain protocol
      state and debugging of the protocol.
      
      Interface to the Routing System's (I2RS) Programmatic interfaces, as
      defined in [I-D.ward-i2rs-framework], provides an alternate way to
      control the configuration and diagnose the operation of the BGP
      protocol.  I2RS may be used for the configuration, manipulation,
      polling or analyzing protocol data.  This document describes set of
      use cases for which I2RS can be used for BGP protocol.  It is
      intended to provide a base for the solution draft describing a set of
      interfaces to the BGP protocol.

  "Routing Information Base Info Model", Nitin Bahadur, Ron Folkes,
  Sriganesh Kini, Jan Medved, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-nitinb-i2rs-rib-info-model-01.txt>

      Routing and routing functions in enterprise and carrier networks are
      typically performed by network devices (routers and switches) using a
      routing information base (RIB).  Protocols and configuration push
      data into the RIB and the RIB manager install state into the
      hardware; for packet forwarding.  This draft specifies an information
      model for the RIB to enable defining a standardized data model.  Such
      a data model can be used to define an interface to the RIB from an
      entity that may even be external to the network device.  This
      interface can be used to support new use-cases being defined by the
      IETF I2RS WG.

  "An Architecture for the Interface to the Routing System", Alia Atlas,
  Joel Halpern, Susan Hares, David Ward, Thomas Nadeau, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-atlas-i2rs-architecture-01.txt>

      This document describes an architecture for a standard, programmatic
      interface for state transfer in and out of the Internet's routing
      system.  It describes the basic architecture, the components, and
      their interfaces with particular focus on those to be standardized as
      part of I2RS.

  "Architectural Considerations of IP Anycast", Danny McPherson, David
  Oran, Dave Thaler, Eric Osterweil, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-iab-anycast-arch-implications-10.txt>

      This memo discusses architectural implications of IP anycast, and
      provides some historical analysis of anycast use by various IETF
      protocols.

  "Architectural Considerations on Application Features in the DNS", Jon
  Peterson, Olaf Kolkman, Hannes Tschofenig, Bernard Aboba, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-iab-dns-applications-07.txt>

      A number of Internet applications rely on the Domain Name System
      (DNS) to support their operations.  Many applications use the DNS to
      locate services for a domain; some for example transform identifiers
      other than domain names into formats that the DNS can process, and
      then fetch application data or service location data from the DNS.
      Proposals incorporating sophisticated application behavior using DNS
      as a substrate have raised questions about the role of the DNS as an
      application platform.  This document explores the architectural
      consequences of using the DNS to implement certain application
      features, and provides guidance to future application designers as to
      the limitations of the DNS as a substrate and the situations in which
      alternative designs should be considered.

  "Technical Considerations for Internet Service Blocking and Filtering",
  Richard Barnes, Alissa Cooper, Olaf Kolkman, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-iab-filtering-considerations-03.txt>

      The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This
      openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but
      it can also allow communications that may be viewed as undesirable by
      certain parties.  Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms
      to limit the extent and impact of abusive or objectionable
      communications.  Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on
      "blocking" and "filtering," the active prevention of such
      communications.  This document examines several technical approaches
      to Internet blocking and filtering in terms of their alignment with
      the overall Internet architecture.  In general, the approach to
      blocking and filtering that is most coherent with the Internet
      architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially undesirable
      services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or
      objectionable communications.

  "Architectural Considerations in Smart Object Networking", Hannes
  Tschofenig, Jari Arkko, Dave Thaler, Danny McPherson, 2013-03-20,
  <draft-iab-smart-object-architecture-02.txt>

      Following the theme "Everything that can be connected will be
      connected", engineers and researchers designing smart object networks
      need to decide how to achieve this in practice.  How can different
      forms of embedded and constrained devices be interconnected?  How can
      they employ and interact with the currently deployed Internet?  This
      memo discusses smart objects and some of the architectural choices
      involved in designing smart object networks and protocols that they
      use.

  "The IEEE 802 / IETF Relationship", Spencer Dawkins, Patricia Thaler,
  Dan Romascanu, 2013-05-05, <draft-iab-rfc4441rev-04.txt>

      This document describes the standardization collaboration between
      Project 802 of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers
      (IEEE) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  This document
      obsoletes RFC 4441.

  "Reflections On Host Firewalls", Dave Thaler, 2013-06-21,
  <draft-iab-host-firewalls-00.txt>

      In today's Internet, the need for firewalls is generally accepted in
      the industry and indeed firewalls are widely deployed in practice.
      Often the result is that software may be running and potentially
      consuming resources, but then communication is blocked by a firewall.
      It's taken for granted that this end state is either desirable or the
      best that can be achieved in practice, rather than (for example) an
      end state where the relevant software is not running or is running in
      a way that would not result in unwanted communication.  In this
      document, we explore the issues behind these assumptions and provide
      suggestions on improving the architecture going forward.

  "DNS Root Name Service Protocol and Deployment Requirements", Marc
  Blanchet, Lars-Johan Liman, 2013-07-10, <draft-iab-2870bis-00.txt>

      The DNS Root Name service are a critical part of the Internet
      architecture.  The protocol and deployment requirements expected to
      be implemented for the DNS root name services are defined in this
      document.  Operational requirements are out of scope.  This document
      obsoletes and reclassifies RFC2870 as Historic.

  "Definitions of Managed Objects for the Fourth Version of Border Gateway
  Protocol (BGP-4), Second Version", Jeffrey Haas, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp4-mibv2-14.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
      objects for managing the Border Gateway Protocol, Version 4.

  "Definitions of Textual Conventions for the Management of the Fourth
  Version of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-4)", Jeffrey Haas, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp4-mibv2-tc-mib-04.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      which defines Textual Conventions for the management of BGP-4.  The
      intent is that these textual conventions will be used in BGP-related
      MIB modules that would otherwise define their own representations.

  "The Accumulated IGP Metric Attribute for BGP", Prodosh Mohapatra, Rex
  Fernando, Eric Rosen, Jim Uttaro, 2013-05-23,
  <draft-ietf-idr-aigp-10.txt>

      Routing protocols that have been designed to run within a single
      administrative domain ("IGPs") generally do so by assigning a metric
      to each link, and then choosing as the installed path between two
      nodes the path for which the total distance (sum of the metric of
      each link along the path) is minimized.  BGP, designed to provide
      routing over a large number of independent administrative domains
      ("autonomous systems"), does not make its path selection decisions
      through the use of a metric.  It is generally recognized that any
      attempt to do so would incur significant scalability problems, as
      well as inter-administration coordination problems.  However, there
      are deployments in which a single administration runs several
      contiguous BGP networks.  In such cases, it can be desirable, within
      that single administrative domain, for BGP to select paths based on a
      metric, just as an IGP would do.  The purpose of this document is to
      provide a specification for doing so.

  "BGP Bestpath Selection Criteria Enhancement", Rajiv Asati, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp-bestpath-selection-criteria-06.txt>

      BGP specification [RFC4271] prescribes 'BGP next-hop reachability'
      as one of the key 'Route Resolvability Condition' that must be
      satisfied before the BGP bestpath candidate selection. This
      condition, however, may not be sufficient (as explained in the
      Appendix section) and desire further granularity.
      
      This document defines enhances the "Route Resolvability Condition"
      to facilitate the next-hop to be resolved in the chosen data plane.

  "Best Practices for Advertisement of Multiple Paths in IBGP", Jim
  Uttaro, Pierre Francois, Roberto Fragassi, Adam Simpson, Keyur Patel,
  2013-06-24, <draft-ietf-idr-add-paths-guidelines-05.txt>

      Add-Paths is a BGP enhancement that allows a BGP router to advertise
      multiple distinct paths for the same prefix/NLRI. This provides a
      number of potential benefits, including reduced routing churn, faster
      convergence and better loadsharing.
      
      This document provides recommendations to implementers of Add-Paths
      so that network operators have the tools needed to address their
      specific applications and to manage the scalability impact of Add-
      Paths. A router implementing Add-Paths may learn many paths for a
      prefix and must decide which of these to advertise to peers. This
      document analyses different algorithms for making this selection and
      provides recommendations based on the target application.

  "Assigned BGP extended communities", Bruno Decraene, Pierre Francois,
  2013-05-21, <draft-ietf-idr-reserved-extended-communities-05.txt>

      This document defines an IANA registry in order to assign non-
      transitive extended communities from.  These are similar to the
      existing well-known BGP communities defined in RFC 1997 but provide a
      control over inter-AS community advertisement as, per RFC RFC 4360,
      they are not transitive across Autonomous System boundaries.
      
      For that purpose, this document defines the use of the reserved
      Autonomous System number 0.65535 in the non-transitive generic four-
      octet AS specific extended community type.

  "Enhanced Route Refresh Capability for BGP-4", Keyur Patel, Enke Chen,
  Balaji Venkatachalapathy, 2013-06-24,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp-enhanced-route-refresh-04.txt>

      In this document we enhance the existing BGP route refresh mechanisms
      to provide for the demarcation of the beginning and the ending of a
      route refresh.  The enhancement can be used to facilitate on-line,
      non-disruptive consistency validations of BGP routing updates.

  "BGP Optimal Route Reflection (BGP-ORR)", Robert Raszuk, Christian
  Cassar, Erik Aman, Bruno Decraene, Stephane Litkowski, 2013-06-04,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp-optimal-route-reflection-05.txt>

      [RFC4456] asserts that, because the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
      cost to a given point in the network will vary across routers, "the
      route reflection approach may not yield the same route selection
      result as that of the full IBGP mesh approach."  One practical
      implication of this assertion is that the deployment of route
      reflection may thwart the ability to achieve hot potato routing.  Hot
      potato routing attempts to direct traffic to the closest AS egress
      point in cases where no higher priority policy dictates otherwise.
      As a consequence of the route reflection method, the choice of exit
      point for a route reflector and its clients will be the egress point
      closest to the route reflector - and not necessarily closest to the
      RR clients.
      
      Section 11 of [RFC4456] describes a deployment approach and a set of
      constraints which, if satsified, would result in the deployment of
      route reflection yielding the same results as the iBGP full mesh
      approach.  Such a deployment approach would make route reflection
      compatible with the application of hot potato routing policy.
      
      As networks evolved to accommodate architectural requirements of new
      services, tunneled (LSP/IP tunneling) networks with centralized route
      reflectors became commonplace.  This is one type of common deployment
      where it would be impractical to satisfy the constraints described in
      Section 11 of [RFC4456].  Yet, in such an environment, hot potato
      routing policy remains desirable.
      
      This document proposes two new solutions which can be deployed to
      facilitate the application of closest exit point policy centralized
      route reflection deployments.

  "Revised Error Handling for BGP UPDATE Messages", John Scudder, Enke
  Chen, Prodosh Mohapatra, Keyur Patel, 2013-06-24,
  <draft-ietf-idr-error-handling-04.txt>

      According to the base BGP specification, a BGP speaker that receives
      an UPDATE message containing a malformed attribute is required to
      reset the session over which the offending attribute was received.
      This behavior is undesirable as a session reset would impact not only
      routes with the offending attribute, but also other valid routes
      exchanged over the session.  This document partially revises the
      error handling for UPDATE messages, and provides guidelines for the
      authors of documents defining new attributes.  Finally, it revises
      the error handling procedures for a number of existing attributes.

  "BGP Custom Decision Process", Alvaro Retana, Russ White, 2013-05-20,
  <draft-ietf-idr-custom-decision-03.txt>

      The BGP specification defines a Decision Process for installation of
      routes into the Loc-RIB.  This process takes into account an
      extensive series of path attributes, which can be manipulated to
      indicate preference for specific paths.  It is cumbersome (if at all
      possible) for the end user to define policies that will select, after
      partial comparison, a path based on subjective local (domain and/or
      node) criteria.
      
      This document defines a new Extended Community, called the Cost
      Community, which may be used in tie breaking during the best path
      selection process.  The end result is a local custom decision
      process.

  "Codification of AS 0 processing.", Warren Kumari, Randy Bush, Heather
  Schiller, Keyur Patel, 2012-08-26, <draft-ietf-idr-as0-06.txt>

      This document updates RFC 4271 and proscribes the use of Autonomous
      System (AS) 0 in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) OPEN and AS_PATH /
      AS4_PATH BGP attribute.

  "Accelerated Routing Convergence for BGP Graceful Restart", Keyur Patel,
  Enke Chen, Rex Fernando, John Scudder, 2013-06-24,
  <draft-ietf-idr-enhanced-gr-03.txt>

      In this document we specify extensions to BGP graceful restart in
      order to avoid unnecessary transmission of the routing information
      preserved across a session restart, thus accelerating the routing
      convergence.

  "Notification Message support for BGP Graceful Restart", Keyur Patel,
  Rex Fernando, John Scudder, Jeffrey Haas, 2013-04-25,
  <draft-ietf-idr-bgp-gr-notification-01.txt>

      The current BGP Graceful Restart mechanism limits the usage of BGP
      Graceful Restart to BGP protocol messages other than a BGP
      NOTIFICATION message.  This document defines an extension to the BGP
      Graceful Restart that permits the Graceful Restart procedures to be
      performed when the BGP speaker receives a BGP NOTIFICATION Message.
      This document also defines a new BGP NOTIFICATION Cease Error subcode
      to prevent BGP speakers supporting the extension defined in this
      document from performing a Graceful Restart.

  "Automatic Route Target Filtering for legacy PEs", Pradosh Mohapatra,
  Arjun Sreekantiah, Keyur Patel, Burjiz Pithawala, Alton Lo, 2013-03-13,
  <draft-ietf-idr-legacy-rtc-01.txt>

      This document describes a simple procedure that allows "legacy" BGP
      speakers to exchange route target membership information in BGP
      without using mechanisms specified in [RFC4684].  The intention of
      the proposed technique is to help in partial deployment scenarios and
      is not meant to replace [RFC4684].

  "Internet Exchange Route Server", Elisa Jasinska, Nick Hilliard, Robert
  Raszuk, Niels Bakker, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server-02.txt>

      This document outlines a specification for multilateral
      interconnections at Internet exchange points (IXPs).  Multilateral
      interconnection is a method of exchanging routing information between
      three or more exterior BGP speakers using a single intermediate
      broker system, referred to as a route server.  Route servers are
      typically used on shared access media networks, such as Internet
      exchange points (IXPs), to facilitate simplified interconnection
      between multiple Internet routers.

  "Making Route Flap Damping Usable", Cristel Pelsser, Randy Bush, Keyur
  Patel, Pradosh Mohapatra, Olaf Maennel, 2013-03-11,
  <draft-ietf-idr-rfd-usable-02.txt>

      Route Flap Damping (RFD) was first proposed to reduce BGP churn in
      routers.  Unfortunately, RFD was found to severely penalize sites for
      being well-connected because topological richness amplifies the
      number of update messages exchanged.  Many operators have turned RFD
      off.  Based on experimental measurement, this document recommends
      adjusting a few RFD algorithmic constants and limits, to reduce the
      high risks with RFD, with the result being damping a non-trivial
      amount of long term churn without penalizing well-behaved prefixes'
      normal convergence process.

  "North-Bound Distribution of Link-State and TE Information using BGP",
  Hannes Gredler, Jan Medved, Stefano Previdi, Adrian Farrel, Saikat Ray,
  2013-05-21, <draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution-03.txt>

      In a number of environments, a component external to a network is
      called upon to perform computations based on the network topology and
      current state of the connections within the network, including
      traffic engineering information.  This is information typically
      distributed by IGP routing protocols within the network
      
      This document describes a mechanism by which links state and traffic
      engineering information can be collected from networks and shared
      with external components using the BGP routing protocol.  This is
      achieved using a new BGP Network Layer Reachability Information
      (NLRI) encoding format.  The mechanism is applicable to physical and
      virtual IGP links.  The mechanism described is subject to policy
      control.
      
      Applications of this technique include Application Layer Traffic
      Optimization (ALTO) servers, and Path Computation Elements (PCEs).

  "Inter-domain SLA Exchange", Shitanshu Shah, Keyur Patel, Sandeep Bajaj,
  Luis Tomotaki, Mohamed Boucadair, 2013-06-27,
  <draft-ietf-idr-sla-exchange-01.txt>

      Network administrators typically provision QoS (Quality of Service)
      policies for their application traffic (such as voice, video) based
      on SLAs (Service Level Agreements) negotiated with their providers,
      and translate those SLAs to vendor specific configuration language.
      Both learning of SLA, either thru SLA documents or via some other
      out-of-band method, and translating them to vendor specific
      configuration language is a complex, many times manual, process and
      prone to errors.  This document proposes an in-band method of SLA
      signaling which can help to simplify some of the complexities.
      
      This document defines an operational transitive attribute to signal
      SLA details in-band, across administrative boundaries (considered as
      Autonomous Systems (AS)), thus simplify and speed-up some of the
      complex provisioning tasks.
      
      Though the use case with the proposed attribute is explicitly defined
      in this document, purpose of this attribute is not limited to this
      use case only.

  "BGP Flow-Spec Extended Community for Traffic Redirect to IP Next Hop",
  Jim Uttaro, Matthieu Texier, David Smith, Wim Henderickx, Adam Simpson,
  2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-idr-flowspec-redirect-ip-00.txt>

      Flow-spec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination
      of traffic flow specification rules. This has many possible
      applications but the primary one for many network operators is the
      distribution of traffic filtering actions for DDoS mitigation. The
      flow-spec standard [RFC 5575] defines a redirect-to-VRF action for
      policy-based forwarding but this mechanism can be difficult to use,
      particularly in networks without L3 VPNs.
      
      This draft proposes a new redirect-to-IP flow-spec action that
      provides a simpler method of policy-based forwarding. This action is
      indicated by the presence of a new BGP extended community in the
      flow-spec route. Many routers already support a redirect-to-IP
      filter action and, in this case, the only new functionality implied
      by this draft is the ability to signal the action using flow-spec.

  "Reservation of Last Autonomous System (AS) Numbers", Jeffrey Haas, Jon
  Mitchell, 2013-07-17, <draft-ietf-idr-last-as-reservation-00.txt>

      This document reserves two Autonomous System numbers (ASNs) at the
      end of the 16 bit and 32 bit ranges, described in this document as
      "Last ASNs" and provides guidance to implementers and operators on
      their use.

  Multimedia Communication Networks", Paul Jones, Gonzalo Salgueiro, James
  Polk, Laura Liess, Hadriel Kaplan, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-insipid-session-id-reqts-08.txt>

      This document specifies the requirements for an end-to-end session
      identifier in IP-based multimedia communication networks.  This
      identifier would enable endpoints, intermediate devices, and
      management and monitoring systems to identify a session end-to-end
      across multiple SIP devices, hops, and administrative domains.

      This document describes an end-to-end Session Identifier for use in
      IP-based Multimedia Communication systems that enables endpoints,
      intermediate devices, and management systems to identify a session
      end-to-end, associate multiple endpoints with a given multipoint
      conference, track communication sessions when they are redirected,
      and associate one or more media flows with a given communication
      session.

-------------------

  "Mesh Link Establishment", Richard Kelsey, 2013-02-21,
  <draft-kelsey-intarea-mesh-link-establishment-05.txt>

      This document defines the mesh link establishment (MLE) protocol for
      establishing and configuring secure radio links in IEEE 802.15.4
      radio mesh networks.  MLE extends IEEE 802.15.4 for use in multihop
      mesh networks by adding three capabilities: 1) dynamically
      configuring and securing radio links, 2) enabling network-wide
      changes to radio parameters, and 3) detecting neighboring devices.
      MLE operates below the routing layer, insulating it from the details
      of configuring, securing, and maintaining individual radio links
      within a larger mesh network.

  "Flow Selection Techniques", Salvatore D'Antonio, Tanja Zseby, Christian
  Henke, Lorenzo Peluso, 2013-05-30,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-flow-selection-tech-18.txt>

      Intermediate Flow Selection Process is the process of selecting a
      subset of Flows from all observed Flows.  The Intermediate Flow
      Selection Process may be located at an IPFIX Exporter, Collector, or
      within an IPFIX Mediator.  It reduces the effort of post-processing
      Flow data and transferring Flow Records.  This document describes
      motivations for using the Intermediate Flow Selection process and
      presents Intermediate Flow Selection techniques.  It provides an
      information model for configuring Intermediate Flow Selection Process
      techniques and discusses what information about an Intermediate Flow
      Selection Process should be exported.

  <draft-ietf-ipfix-ie-doctors-07.txt>

      This document provides guidelines for how to write definitions of new
      Information Elements for the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
      protocol.  It provides instructions on using the proper conventions
      for Information Elements to be registered in the IANA IPFIX

  "Flow Aggregation for the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol",
  Brian Trammell, Arno Wagner, Benoit Claise, 2012-11-19,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-a9n-08.txt>

      This document provides a common implementation-independent basis for
      the interoperable application of the IP Flow Information Export
      (IPFIX) Protocol to the handling of Aggregated Flows, which are IPFIX
      Flows representing packets from multiple Original Flows sharing some
      set of common properties.  It does this through a detailed
      terminology and a descriptive Intermediate Aggregation Process
      architecture, including a specification of methods for Original Flow
      counting and counter distribution across intervals.

  "Specification of the IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX) Protocol for
  the Exchange of Flow Information", Benoit Claise, Brian Trammell,
  2013-07-11, <draft-ietf-ipfix-protocol-rfc5101bis-10.txt>

      This document specifies the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
      protocol that serves for transmitting Traffic Flow information over
      the network. In order to transmit Traffic Flow information from an
      Exporting Process to a Collecting Process, a common representation of
      flow data and a standard means of communicating them is required.
      This document describes how the IPFIX Data and Template Records are
      carried over a number of transport protocols from an IPFIX Exporting
      Process to an IPFIX Collecting Process. This document obsoletes RFC
      5101.

  "Operation of the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol on IPFIX
  Mediators", Benoit Claise, Atsushi Kobayashi, Brian Trammell,
  2013-07-29, <draft-ietf-ipfix-mediation-protocol-06.txt>

      This document specifies the operation of the IP Flow Information
      Export (IPFIX) protocol specific to IPFIX Mediators, including
      Template and Observation Point management, timing considerations, and
      other Mediator-specific concerns.

  "Information Model for IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX)", Benoit
  Claise, Brian Trammell, 2013-02-12,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-information-model-rfc5102bis-10.txt>

      This document defines the datatypes and management policy for the
      information model for the IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX)
      protocol. This information model is maintained as the IANA IPFIX
      Information Element Registry, the initial contents of which were
      defined by RFC 5102. This information model is used by the IPFIX
      Protocol for encoding measured traffic information and information
      related to the traffic Observation Point, the traffic Metering
      Process, and the Exporting Process. Although developed for the IPFIX
      Protocol, the model is defined in an open way that easily allows
      using it in other protocols, interfaces, and applications. This
      document obsoletes RFC 5102.

  "Exporting MIB Variables using the IPFIX Protocol", Benoit Claise, Paul
  Aitken, Jürgen Schönwälder, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-mib-variable-export-02.txt>

      This document specifies a way to complement IPFIX Flow Records with
      Management Information Base (MIB) objects, avoiding the need to
      define new IPFIX Information Elements for existing Management
      Information Base objects that are already fully specified.
      
      This method requires an extension to the current IPFIX protocol.  New
      Template Set and Options Template Sets are specified to allow the
      export of Extended Field Specifiers, which may represent IPFIX
      Information Elements and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
      MIB Objects.

  "Information Elements for Data Link Layer Traffic Measurement", Shingo
  Kashima, Atsushi Kobayashi, Paul Aitken, 2013-07-02,
  <draft-ietf-ipfix-data-link-layer-monitoring-03.txt>

      This document describes Information Elements related to data link
      layer.  They are used by the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
      protocol for encoding measured data link layer traffic information.

IP Performance Metrics (ippm)
-----------------------------

  "Rate Measurement Test Protocol Problem Statement", Al Morton,
  2013-04-23, <draft-ietf-ippm-rate-problem-03.txt>

      This memo presents an access rate-measurement problem statement for
      test protocols to measure IP Performance Metrics.  The rate
      measurement scenario has wide-spread attention of Internet access
      subscribers and seemingly all industry players, including regulators.
      Key test protocol aspects require the ability to control packet size
      on the tested path and enable asymmetrical packet size testing in a
      controller-responder architecture.

  "Test Plan and Results for Advancing RFC 2680 on the Standards Track",
  Len Ciavattone, Ruediger Geib, Al Morton, Matthias Wieser, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-ietf-ippm-testplan-rfc2680-03.txt>

      This memo proposes to advance a performance metric RFC along the
      standards track, specifically RFC 2680 on One-way Loss Metrics.
      Observing that the metric definitions themselves should be the
      primary focus rather than the implementations of metrics, this memo
      describes the test procedures to evaluate specific metric requirement
      clauses to determine if the requirement has been interpreted and
      implemented as intended.  Two completely independent implementations
      have been tested against the key specifications of RFC 2680.

  "Model Based Bulk Performance Metrics", Matt Mathis, Al Morton,
  2013-06-21, <draft-ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics-00.txt>

      We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to determine
      if a long path can meet predefined end-to-end application performance
      targets.  This is done by subpath at a time testing -- by applying a
      suite of single property tests to successive subpaths of a long path.
      In many cases these single property tests are based on existing IPPM
      metrics, with the addition of success and validity criteria.  The
      subpath at a time tests are designed to facilitate IP providers
      eliminating all known conditions that might prevent the full end-to-
      end path from meeting the users target performance.
      
      This approach makes it possible to to determine the IP performance
      requirements needed to support the desired end-to-end TCP
      performance.  The IP metrics are based on traffic patterns that mimic
      TCP but are precomputed independently of the actual behavior of TCP
      over the subpath under test.  This makes the measurements open loop,
      eliminating nearly all of the difficulties encountered by traditional
      bulk transport metrics, which rely on congestion control equilibrium
      behavior.
      
      A natural consequence of this methodology is verifiable network
      measurement: measurements from any given vantage point are repeatable
      from other vantage points.

  "Network Performance Measurement for IPsec", Kostas Pentikousis, Yang
  Cui, Emma Zhang, 2013-07-05, <draft-ietf-ippm-ipsec-00.txt>

      IPsec is a mature technology with several interoperable
      implementations.  Indeed, the use of IPsec tunnels is increasingly
      gaining popularity in several deployment scenarios, not the least in
      what used to be solely areas of traditional telecommunication
      protocols.  Wider deployment calls for mechanisms and methods that
      enable tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure one-way and
      two-way network performance.  Unfortunately, however, standard IP
      performance measurement security mechanisms cannot be readily used
      with IPsec.  This document makes the case for employing IPsec to
      protect the One-way and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocols (O/
      TWAMP) and proposes a method which combines IKEv2 and O/TWAMP as
      defined in RFC 4656 and RFC 5357, respectively.  This specification
      aims, on the one hand, to ensure that O/TWAMP can be secured with the
      best mechanisms we have at our disposal today while, on the other
      hand, it facilitates the applicability of O/TWAMP to networks that
      have already deployed IPsec.

  "A Reference Path and Measurement Points for LMAP", Marcelo Bagnulo,
  Trevor Burbridge, Sam Crawford, Philip Eardley, Al Morton, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-ietf-ippm-lmap-path-00.txt>

      This document defines a reference path for Large-scale Measurement of
      Broadband Access Performance (LMAP) and measurement points for
      commonly used performance metrics.

  "Advanced Stream and Sampling Framework for IPPM", Joachim Fabini, Al
  Morton, 2013-07-11, <draft-ietf-ippm-2330-update-00.txt>

      To obtain repeatable results in modern networks, test descriptions
      need an expanded stream parameter framework that also augments
      aspects specified as Type-P for test packets.  This memo proposes to
      update the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework with advanced
      considerations for measurement methodology and testing.  The existing
      framework mostly assumes deterministic connectivity, and that a
      single test stream will represent the characteristics of the path
      when it is aggregated with other flows.  Networks have evolved and
      test stream descriptions must evolve with them, otherwise unexpected
      network features may dominate the measured performance.  This memo
      describes new stream parameters for both network characterization and
      support of application design using IPPM metrics.

IP Security Maintenance and Extensions (ipsecme)
------------------------------------------------

  "Auto Discovery VPN Problem Statement and Requirements", Vishwas Manral,
  Stephen Hanna, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-ipsecme-ad-vpn-problem-09.txt>

      This document describes the problem of enabling a large number of
      systems to communicate directly using IPsec to protect the traffic
      between them.  It then expands on the requirements, for such a
      solution.
      
      Manual configuration of all possible tunnels is too cumbersome in
      many such cases.  In other cases the IP address of endpoints change
      or the endpoints may be behind NAT gateways, making static
      configuration impossible.  The Auto Discovery VPN solution will
      address these requirements.

  "Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance
  for Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header
  (AH)", David McGrew, Wajdi Feghali, 2013-03-12,
  <draft-ietf-ipsecme-esp-ah-reqts-00.txt>

      This Internet Draft is standards track proposal to update to the
      Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for ESP and AH;
      it also adds usage guidance to help in the selection of these
      algorithms.
      
      The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header
      (AH) protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms to
      provide confidentiality and/or data origin authentication to
      protected data communications in the IP Security (IPsec)
      architecture.  To ensure interoperability between disparate
      implementations, the IPsec standard specifies a set of mandatory-to-
      implement algorithms.  This document specifies the current set of
      mandatory-to-implement algorithms for ESP and AH, specifies
      algorithms that should be implemented because they may be promoted to
      mandatory at some future time, and also recommends against the
      implementation of some obsolete algorithms.  Usage guidance is also
      provided to help the user of ESP and AH best achieve their security
      goals through appropriate choices of cryptographic algorithms.

  "More Raw Public Keys for IKEv2", Tero Kivinen, Paul Wouters, Hannes
  Tschofenig, 2013-04-08, <draft-ietf-ipsecme-oob-pubkey-00.txt>

      The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol currently only
      supports raw RSA keys.  In some environments it is useful to make use
      of other types of public keys, such as those based on Elliptic Curve
      Cryptography.  This documents adds support for other types of raw
      public keys to IKEv2 and obsoletes the old raw RSA key format.

  "IKEv2 Fragmentation", Valery Smyslov, 2013-07-02,
  <draft-ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-fragmentation-00.txt>

      This document describes the way to avoid IP fragmentation of large
      IKEv2 messages.  This allows IKEv2 messages to traverse network
      devices that don't allow IP fragments to pass through.

IS-IS for IP Internets (isis)
-----------------------------

  "IS-IS Operational Enhancements for Network Maintenance Events", Naiming
  Shen, Tony Li, Shane Amante, Mikael Abrahamsson, 2013-02-14,
  <draft-ietf-isis-oper-enhance-03.txt>

      This document describes an improved IS-IS neighbor management scheme
      which can be used to enhance operational experience in terms of
      convergence speed and finer control of neighbor cost over a LAN.

  "IS-IS Reverse Metric TLV for Network Maintenance Events", Naiming Shen,
  Tony Li, Shane Amante, Mikael Abrahamsson, 2013-02-14,
  <draft-ietf-isis-reverse-metric-03.txt>

      This document describes an improved IS-IS neighbor management scheme
      which can be used to enhance network performance by allowing
      operators to quickly and accurately shift traffic away from a point-
      to-point or multi-access LAN interface by allowing one IS-IS router
      to signal to a second, adjacent IS-IS neighbor to adjust its IS-IS
      metric that should be used to temporarily reach the first IS-IS
      router during network maintenance events.

  "Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Use of IS-IS",
  Donald Eastlake, Tissa Senevirathne, Anoop Ghanwani, Dinesh Dutt, Ayan
  Banerjee, 2013-04-09, <draft-ietf-isis-rfc6326bis-01.txt>

      The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
      protocol provides optimal pair-wise data frame forwarding without
      configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology and link
      technology, and support for multipathing of both unicast and
      multicast traffic. This document specifies the data formats and code
      points for the IS-IS extensions to support TRILL. These data formats
      and code points may also be used by technologies other than TRILL.
      This document obsoletes RFC 6326.

  "IS-IS Extended Sequence number TLV", Uma Chunduri, Wenhu Lu, Albert
  Tian, Naiming Shen, 2013-06-10,
  <draft-ietf-isis-extended-sequence-no-tlv-00.txt>

      This document defines Extended Sequence number TLV to protect
      Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) PDUs from replay
      attacks.

  "IS-IS Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions", Stefano Previdi,
  Spencer Giacalone, David Ward, John Drake, Alia Atlas, Clarence
  Filsfils, 2013-06-17, <draft-ietf-isis-te-metric-extensions-00.txt>

      In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
      information networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network
      performance criteria (e.g. latency) are becoming as critical to data
      path selection as other metrics.
      
      This document describes extensions to IS-IS TE [RFC5305] such that
      network performance information can be distributed and collected in a
      scalable fashion.  The information distributed using ISIS TE Metric
      Extensions can then be used to make path selection decisions based on
      network performance.
      
      Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which network
      performance information is distributed.  The mechanisms for measuring
      network performance or acting on that information, once distributed,
      are outside the scope of this document.

  "JSON Web Encryption (JWE)", Michael Jones, Eric Rescorla, Joe
  Hildebrand, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-jose-json-web-encryption-14.txt,.pdf>

      JSON Web Encryption (JWE) is a means of representing encrypted
      content using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) based data
      structures.  Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with
      this specification are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms
      (JWA) specification.  Related digital signature and MAC capabilities
      are described in the separate JSON Web Signature (JWS) specification.

  "JSON Web Key (JWK)", Michael Jones, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-jose-json-web-key-14.txt,.pdf>

      A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data
      structure that represents a cryptographic key.  This specification
      also defines a JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) JSON data structure for
      representing a set of JWKs.  Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers
      for use with this specification are described in the separate JSON
      Web Algorithms (JWA) specification.

  "JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)", Michael Jones, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-jose-json-web-algorithms-14.txt,.pdf>

      The JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) specification enumerates cryptographic
      algorithms and identifiers to be used with the JSON Web Signature
      (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), and JSON Web Key (JWK)
      specifications.

  "JSON Web Signature (JWS)", Michael Jones, John Bradley, Nat Sakimura,
  2013-07-29, <draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-14.txt,.pdf>

      JSON Web Signature (JWS) is a means of representing content secured
      with digital signatures or Message Authentication Codes (MACs) using
      JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) based data structures.
      Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with this
      specification are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)
      specification.  Related encryption capabilities are described in the
      separate JSON Web Encryption (JWE) specification.

  "Use Cases and Requirements for JSON Object Signing and Encryption
  (JOSE)", Richard Barnes, 2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-jose-use-cases-03.txt>

      Many Internet applications have a need for object-based security
      mechanisms in addition to security mechanisms at the network layer or
      transport layer.  In the past, the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
      has provided a binary secure object format based on ASN.1.  Over
      time, the use of binary object encodings such as ASN.1 has been
      overtaken by text-based encodings, for example JavaScript Object
      Notation.  This document defines a set of use cases and requirements
      for a secure object format encoded using JavaScript Object Notation
      (JSON), drawn from a variety of application security mechanisms
      currently in development.

JavaScript Object Notation (json)
---------------------------------

  "The application/json Media Type for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)",
  Douglas Crockford, 2013-06-06, <draft-ietf-json-rfc4627bis-02.txt>

      JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, text-based,
      language-independent data interchange format.  It was derived from
      the ECMAScript Programming Language Standard.  JSON defines a small
      set of formatting rules for the portable representation of structured
      data.

Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols (karp)
------------------------------------------------------

  "Database of Long-Lived Symmetric Cryptographic Keys", Russ Housley, Tim
  Polk, Sam Hartman, Dacheng Zhang, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-karp-crypto-key-table-08.txt>

      This document specifies the information contained in a conceptual
      database of long-lived cryptographic keys used by many different
      security protocols.  The database is designed to support both manual
      and automated key management.  In addition to describing the schema
      for the database, this document describes the operations that can be
      performed on the database as well as the requirements for the
      security protocols that wish to use the database.  In many typical
      scenarios, the security protocols do not directly use the long-lived
      key, but rather a key derivation function is used to derive a short-
      lived key from a long-lived key.

  "Operations Model for Router Keying", Sam Hartman, Dacheng Zhang,
  2013-07-05, <draft-ietf-karp-ops-model-07.txt>

      Developing an operational and management model for routing protocol
      security that works with all the routing protocols will be critical
      to the success of routing protocol security efforts.  This document
      discusses issues and begins to consider development of these models.

  "KARP IS-IS security analysis", Uma Chunduri, Albert Tian, Wenhu Lu,

Common Authentication Technology Next Generation (kitten)
---------------------------------------------------------

  "SAML Enhanced Client SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms", Scott Cantor, Simon
  Josefsson, 2013-05-13, <draft-ietf-kitten-sasl-saml-ec-09.txt>

      Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 is a generalized
      framework for the exchange of security-related information between
      asserting and relying parties.  Simple Authentication and Security
      Layer (SASL) and the Generic Security Service Application Program
      Interface (GSS-API) are application frameworks to facilitate an
      extensible authentication model.  This document specifies a SASL and
      GSS-API mechanism for SAML 2.0 that leverages the capabilities of a
      SAML-aware "enhanced client" to address significant barriers to
      federated authentication in a manner that encourages reuse of
      existing SAML bindings and profiles designed for non-browser
      scenarios.

  "A set of SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms for OAuth", William Mills, Tim
  Showalter, Hannes Tschofenig, 2013-02-24,
  <draft-ietf-kitten-sasl-oauth-10.txt>

      OAuth enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to a
      protected resource, either on behalf of a resource owner by
      orchestrating an approval interaction, or by allowing the third-party
      application to obtain access on its own behalf.
      
      This document defines how an application client uses credentials
      obtained via OAuth over the Simple Authentication and Security Layer
      (SASL) or the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface
      (GSS-API) to access a protected resource at a resource serve.
      Thereby, it enables schemes defined within the OAuth framework for
      non-HTTP-based application protocols.
      
      Clients typically store the user's long-term credential.  This does,
      however, lead to significant security vulnerabilities, for example,
      when such a credential leaks.  A significant benefit of OAuth for
      usage in those clients is that the password is replaced by a token.
      Tokens typically provided limited access rights and can be managed
      and revoked separately from the user's long-term credential
      (password).

  "Kerberos Authorization Data Container Authenticated by Multiple MACs",
  Simo Sorce, Tom Yu, Thomas Hardjono, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-krb-wg-cammac-05.txt>

      Abstract: This document specifies a Kerberos Authorization Data
      container that supersedes AD-KDC-ISSUED.  It allows for multiple
      Message Authentication Codes (MACs) or signatures to authenticate the
      contained Authorization Data elements.

  "Move Kerberos protocol parameter registries to IANA", Tom Yu,
  2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-kitten-kerberos-iana-registries-02.txt>

      The Keberos 5 network authentication protocol has several numeric
      protocol parameters.  Most of these parameters are not currently
      under IANA maintenance.  This document requests that IANA take over
      the maintenance of the remainder of these Kerberos parameters.

  "Initial and Pass Through Authentication Using Kerberos V5 and the GSS-
  API (IAKERB)", Jim Schaad, Larry Zhu, Jeffrey Altman, 2013-04-10,
  <draft-ietf-kitten-iakerb-00.txt>

      This document defines extensions to the Kerberos protocol and the
      GSS-API Kerberos mechanism that enable a GSS-API Kerberos client to
      exchange messages with the KDC using the GSS-API acceptor as the
      proxy, by encapsulating the Kerberos messages inside GSS-API tokens.
      With these extensions a client can obtain Kerberos tickets for
      services where the KDC is not accessible to the client, but is
      accessible to the application server.

  "AES Encryption with HMAC-SHA2 for Kerberos 5", Kelley Burgin, Michael
  Peck, 2013-06-28, <draft-ietf-kitten-aes-cts-hmac-sha2-01.txt>

      This document specifies two encryption types and two corresponding
      checksum types for Kerberos 5.  The new types use AES in CTS mode
      (CBC mode with ciphertext stealing) for confidentiality and HMAC with
      a SHA-2 hash for integrity.

  "Channel Binding Signalling for the Generic Security Services
  Application Programming Interface", Nico Williams, 2013-07-07,
  <draft-ietf-kitten-channel-bound-flag-00.txt>

      Channel binding is a technique that allows applications to use a
      secure channel at a lower layer without having to use authentication
      at that lower layer.  The concept of channel binding comes from the
      Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-
      API).  It turns out that the semantics commonly implemented are
      different that those specified in the base GSS-API RFC (RFC2743), and
      that that specification has a serious bug.  This document addresses
      both, the inconsistency as-implemented and the specification bug.
      
      This Internet-Draft proposes the addition of a "channel bound" return
      flag for the GSS_Init_sec_context() and GSS_Accept_sec_context()
      functions.  Two behaviors are specified: a default, safe behavior
      reflecting existing implementation deployments, and a behavior that
      is only safe when the application specifically tells the GSS-API that
      it (the application) supports the new behavior.  Additional API
      elements related to this are also added, including a new security
      context establishment API.

Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (l2vpn)
----------------------------------------

  "IP-Only LAN Service (IPLS)", Himanshu Shah, Eric Rosen, Francois Le
  Faucheur, Giles Heron, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-ipls-12.txt>

      A Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [VPLS] is used to interconnect
      systems across a wide-area or metropolitan-area network, making it
      appear that they are on a private LAN.  The systems which are
      interconnected may themselves be LAN switches.  If, however, they
      are IP hosts or IP routers, certain simplifications to the operation
      of the VPLS are possible.  We call this simplified type of VPLS an
      "IP-only LAN Service" (IPLS).  In an IPLS, as in a VPLS, LAN
      interfaces are run in promiscuous mode, and frames are forwarded
      based on their destination MAC addresses.  However, the maintenance
      of the MAC forwarding tables is done via signaling, rather than via
      the MAC address learning procedures specified in [IEEE 802.1D].
      This draft specifies the protocol extensions and procedures for
      support of the IPLS service.

  "Multicast in VPLS", Rahul Aggarwal, Yakov Rekhter, Yuji Kamite, Luyuan
  Fang, 2013-07-02, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast-14.txt>

      [RFC4761] and [RFC4762] describe a solution for Virtual Private LAN
      Service (VPLS) multicast that relies on the use of point-to-point or
      multipoint-to-point unicast Label Switched Paths (LSPs) for carrying
      multicast traffic. This solution has certain limitations for certain
      VPLS multicast traffic profiles. For example, it may result in highly
      non-optimal bandwidth utilization when large amount of multicast
      traffic is to be transported.
      
      This document describes a solution for overcoming a subset of the
      limitations of existing VPLS multicast solution. It describes
      procedures for VPLS multicast that utilize multicast trees in the
      service provider (SP) network. The solution described in this
      document allows sharing of one such multicast tree among multiple
      VPLS instances. Furthermore, the solution described in this document
      allows a single multicast tree in the SP network to carry traffic
      belonging only to a specified set of one or more IP multicast streams
      from one or more VPLS instances.

  "PIM Snooping over VPLS", Olivier Dornon, Jayant Kotalwar, Venu Hemige,
  Ray Qiu, Jeffrey Zhang, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-pim-snooping-04.txt>

      This document describes the procedures and recommendations for VPLS
      PEs to facilitate replication of multicast traffic to only certain
      ports (behind which there are interested PIM routers and/or IGMP
      hosts) via PIM Snooping and PIM Proxy.
      
      With PIM Snooping, PEs passively listen to certain PIM control
      messages to build control and forwarding states while transparently
      flooding those messages.  With PIM Proxy, PEs do not flood PIM Join/
      Prune messages but only generate their own and send out of certain
      ports, based on the control states built from downstream Join/Prune
      messages.  PIM Proxy is required when PIM Join suppression is enabled
      on the CE devices and useful to reduce PIM control traffic in a VPLS
      domain.
      
      The document also describes PIM Relay, which can be viewed as light-
      weight proxy, where all downstream Join/Prune messages are simply
      forwarded out of certain ports but not flooded to avoid triggering
      PIM Join suppression on CE devices.

  Thomas Nadeau, Kiran Koushik, Rohit Mediratta, 2013-06-14,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mib-10.txt>

      This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
      Information Base for use with network management protocols in the
      Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects for
      modeling of Virtual Private LAN services. It needs to be used in
      conjunction with Pseudowire (PW) Management Information Base
      [RFC5601].

  "LDP Extensions for Optimized MAC Address Withdrawal in H-VPLS", Pranjal
  Dutta, Florin Balus, Olen Stokes, Geraldine Calvignac, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-ldp-mac-opt-08.txt>

      [RFC4762] describes a mechanism to remove or unlearn MAC addresses
      that have been dynamically learned in a VPLS Instance for faster
      convergence on topology change.  The procedure also removes MAC
      addresses in the VPLS that do not require relearning due to such
      topology change.  This document defines an enhancement to the MAC
      Address Withdrawal procedure with empty MAC List [RFC4762], which
      enables a Provider Edge(PE) device to remove only the MAC addresses
      that need to be relearned.  Additional extensions to [RFC4762] MAC
      Withdrawal procedures are specified to provide optimized MAC flushing
      for the PBB-VPLS specified in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-pbb-vpls-pe-model] .

  "Extensions to VPLS PE model for Provider Backbone Bridging", Florin
  Balus, Ali Sajassi, Nabil Bitar, 2013-06-13,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-pbb-vpls-pe-model-07.txt>

      IEEE 802.1 Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB) [IEEE.802.1Q-2011] defines
      an architecture and bridge protocols for interconnection of multiple
      Provider Bridge Networks (PBNs). PBB was defined in IEEE as a
      connectionless technology based on multipoint VLAN tunnels.  PBB can
      be used to attain better scalability in terms of number of customer
      MAC addresses and number of service instances that can be supported.
      
      Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [RFC4664] provides a framework for
      extending Ethernet LAN services, using MPLS tunneling capabilities,
      through a routed MPLS backbone without running RSTP or MSTP across
      the backbone. As a result, VPLS has been deployed on a large scale in
      service provider networks.
      
      This draft discusses extensions to the VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model
      required to incorporate desirable PBB components while maintaining
      the Service Provider fit of the initial model.

  "BGP based Multi-homing in Virtual Private LAN Service", Bhupesh
  Kothari, Kireeti Kompella, Wim Henderickx, Florin Balus, Jim Uttaro,
  Senad Palislamovic, Wen Lin, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-multihoming-06.txt>

      Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a Layer 2 Virtual Private
      Network (VPN) that gives its customers the appearance that their
      sites are connected via a Local Area Network (LAN).  It is often
      required for the Service Provider (SP) to give the customer redundant
      connectivity to some sites, often called "multi-homing".  This memo
      shows how BGP-based multi-homing can be offered in the context of LDP
      and BGP VPLS solutions.

  "VPLS Interoperability with Provider Backbone Bridges", Ali Sajassi,
  Samer Salam, Nabil Bitar, Florin Balus, 2013-07-10,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-pbb-vpls-interop-05.txt>

      The scalability of H-VPLS with Ethernet access networks can be
      improved by incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge functionality in
      the VPLS access. Provider Backbone Bridging has been standardized as
      IEEE 802.1ah-2008, and aims to improve the scalability of MAC
      addresses and service instances in Provider Ethernet networks. This
      document describes different interoperability scenarios where
      Provider Backbone Bridge functionality is used in H-VPLS with
      Ethernet or MPLS access network to attain better scalability in terms
      of number of customer MAC addresses and number of service instances.
      The document also describes the scenarios and the mechanisms for
      incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge functionality within H-VPLS
      with existing Ethernet access and interoperability among them.
      Furthermore, the document discusses the migration mechanisms and
      scenarios by which Provider Backbone Bridge functionality can be
      incorporated into H-VPLS with existing MPLS access.

  "MAC Flush Loop Detection in VPLS", Paul Kwok, Pranjal Dutta,
  2013-03-31, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-macflush-ld-03.txt>

      MAC Address Withdrawal is a mechanism described in [RFC4762] to
      remove or unlearn MAC addresses that have been dynamically learned in
      a VPLS instance, for faster convergence on topology change.  Failure
      of mechanisms that control loop free connectivity among VPLS PE-rs
      nodes may cause MAC Address Withdrawal messages looping among those
      nodes, leading to Denial of Service (DoS) or complete failure of
      control plane in the PE-rs nodes.  This document describes a
      mechanism to detect and prevent loops of MAC Address Withdrawal
      messages in a VPLS PE-rs node on such failures.

  "Extension to LDP-VPLS for Ethernet Broadcast and Multicast", Frederic

  Lizhong Jin, 2013-02-22,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-ldp-vpls-broadcast-exten-05.txt>

      This document proposes a simple extension to LDP-VPLS to improve
      bandwidth efficiency for Ethernet broadcast/multicast traffic
      within a carrier's network. It makes use of unidirectional
      point-to-multipoint PseudoWires to minimise payload frame duplication
      on physical links.

  Support in L2VPN", Simon DeLord, Frederic JOUNAY, Lu Huang, Zhihua Liu,
  Manuel Paul, 2013-07-29, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-etree-reqt-05.txt>

      This document provides functional requirements for Metro Ethernet
      Forum (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) support in multipoint L2VPN
      solutions (referred to as simply L2VPN). It is intended that
      potential solutions will use these requirements as guidelines.

  "A Framework for E-Tree Service over MPLS Network", Simon DeLord,
  Frederic JOUNAY, Lucy Yong, Lizhong Jin, Yuji Kamite, Wim Henderickx,
  2013-02-22, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-etree-frwk-02.txt>

      This document proposes a solution framework for supporting Metro
      Ethernet Forum (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) services over a
      Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network. The objective is to
      provide a simple and effective approach to emulate E-Tree services
      in addition to Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) services on an existing MPLS
      network.

  Isaac, Lizhong Jin, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-pbb-evpn-05.txt>

      This document discusses how Ethernet Provider Backbone Bridging
      [802.1ah] can be combined with EVPN in order to reduce the number of
      BGP MAC advertisement routes by aggregating Customer/Client MAC (C-
      MAC) addresses via Provider Backbone MAC address (B-MAC), provide
      client MAC address mobility using C-MAC aggregation and B-MAC sub-
      netting, confine the scope of C-MAC learning to only active flows,
      offer per site policies and avoid C-MAC address flushing on topology
      changes. The combined solution is referred to as PBB-EVPN.

  "Requirements for Ethernet VPN (EVPN)", Ali Sajassi, Rahul Aggarwal,
  Nabil Bitar, Aldrin Isaac, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-evpn-req-04.txt>

      The widespread adoption of Ethernet L2VPN services and the advent of
      new applications for the technology (e.g., data center interconnect)
      have culminated in a new set of requirements that are not readily
      addressable by the current Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)
      solution. In particular, multi-homing with all-active forwarding is
      not supported and there's no existing solution to leverage
      Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs for optimizing the delivery of
      multi-destination frames. Furthermore, the provisioning of VPLS, even
      in the context of BGP-based auto-discovery, requires network
      operators to specify various network parameters on top of the access
      configuration. This document specifies the requirements for an
      Ethernet VPN (EVPN) solution which addresses the above issues.

  "VPLS PE Model for E-Tree Support", Yuanlong Jiang, Lucy Yong, Manuel
  Paul, Frederic JOUNAY, Florin Balus, Wim Henderickx, Ali Sajassi,
  2013-02-06, <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-pe-etree-01.txt>

      A generic VPLS solution for E-Tree services is proposed which uses
      VLANs to indicate root/leaf traffic. A VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model
      is illustrated as an example for the solution. In the solution, E-
      Tree VPLS PEs are interconnected by PWs which carry the VLAN
      indicating the E-Tree attribute, the MAC address based Ethernet
      forwarding engine and the PW work in the same way as before. A
      signaling mechanism for E-Tree capability and VLAN mapping
      negotiation is further described.

  Jin, Ran Chen, Dennis Cai, Samer Salam, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-inter-domain-redundancy-02.txt>

      In many VPLS deployments based on [RFC4762], inter-domain
      connectivity has been deployed without node redundancy, or with node
      redundancy in a single domain.  This document describes a solution
      for inter-domain VPLS based on RFC4762 with node and link redundancy
      in both domains.

Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (l3vpn)
----------------------------------------

  "MVPN: Using Bidirectional P-Tunnels", Eric Rosen, IJsbrand Wijnands,
  Yiqun Cai, Arjen Boers, 2013-04-10, <draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-bidir-05.txt>

      A set of prior RFCs specify procedures for supporting multicast in
      BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  These procedures allow customer multicast data to
      travel across a service provider's backbone network through a set of
      multicast tunnels.  The tunnels are advertised in certain BGP "auto-
      discovery" routes, by means of a BGP attribute known as the "Provider
      Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) Tunnel attribute".  Encodings have
      been defined that allow the PMSI Tunnel attribute to identify
      bidirectional (multipoint-to-multipoint) multicast distribution
      trees.  However, the prior RFCs do not provide all the necessary
      procedures for using bidirectional tunnels to support multicast VPNs.
      This document updates RFCs 6513 and 6625 by specifying those
      procedures.  In particular, it specifies the procedures for assigning
      customer multicast flows (unidirectional or bidirectional) to
      specific bidirectional tunnels in the provider backbone, for
      advertising such assignments, and for determining which flows have
      been assigned to which tunnels.

  "Virtual Hub-and-Spoke in BGP/MPLS VPNs", Huajin Jeng, Jim Uttaro, Luay
  Jalil, Bruno Decraene, Yakov Rekhter, Rahul Aggarwal, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-ietf-l3vpn-virtual-hub-08.txt>

      With BGP/MPLS VPNs, providing any-to-any connectivity among sites of
      a given Virtual Private Network would require each Provider Edge
      router that has one or more of these sites connected to it to hold
      all the routes of that Virtual Private Network. The approach
      described in this document allows the VPN service provider to reduce
      the number of Provider Edge routers that have to maintain all these
      routes by requiring only a subset of these routers to maintain all
      these routes.
      
      Furthermore, when Provider Edge routers use ingress replication to
      carry multicast traffic of VPN customers, the approach described in
      this document may under certain circumstances allow to reduce
      bandwidth inefficiency associated with ingress replication, and to
      redistribute the replication load among Provider Edge routers.

      This memo defines an portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
      
      In particular, it describes managed objects to configure and/or

      This document describes a solution in which the control plane
      protocol specified in BGP/MPLS IP VPNs [RFC4364] is used to provide a
      Virtual Network service to end-systems.  These end-systems may be
      used to provide network services or may directly host end-to-end

  Wijnands, Eric Rosen, Uwe Joorde, 2013-05-15,
  <draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-mldp-nlri-01.txt>

      Many service providers offer "BGP/MPLS IP VPN" service to their
      customers.  Existing IETF standards specify the procedures and
      protocols that a service provider uses in order to offer this service
      to customers who have IP unicast and IP multicast traffic in their
      VPNs.  It is also desirable to be able to support customers who have
      MPLS multicast traffic in their VPNs.  This document specifies the
      procedures and protocol extensions that are needed to support
      customers who use the Multicast Extensions to Label Distribution
      Protocol (mLDP) as the control protocol for their MPLS multicast
      traffic.  Existing standards do provide some support for customers
      who use mLDP, but only under a restrictive set of circumstances.
      This document generalizes the existing support to include all cases
      where the customer uses mLDP, without any restrictions.

  "Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol In-Band Signaling in a VRF
  Context", IJsbrand Wijnands, Paul Hitchen, Nicolai Leymann, Wim
  Henderickx,  arkadiy.gulko@thomsonreuters.com, 2013-06-21,
  <draft-ietf-l3vpn-mldp-vrf-in-band-signaling-01.txt>

      Sometimes an IP multicast distribution tree (MDT) traverses both
      MPLS-enabled and non-MPLS-enabled regions of a network.  Typically
      the MDT begins and ends in non-MPLS regions, but travels through an
      MPLS region.  In such cases, it can be useful to begin building the
      MDT as a pure IP MDT, then convert it to an MPLS Multipoint LSP
      (Label Switched Path) when it enters an MPLS-enabled region, and then
      convert it back to a pure IP MDT when it enters a non-MPLS-enabled
      region.  Other documents specify the procedures for building such a
      hybrid MDT, using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) in the non-
      MPLS region of the network, and using Multipoint Extensions to Label
      Distribution Protocol (mLDP) in the MPLS region.  This document
      extends those procedures to handle the case where the link connecting
      the two regions is a "Virtual Routing and Forwarding Table" (VRF)
      link, as defined in the "BGP IP/MPLS VPN" specifications.  However,
      this document is primarily aimed at particular use cases where VRFs
      are used to support multicast applications other than Multicast VPN.

  "Extranet Multicast in BGP/IP MPLS VPNs", Yakov Rekhter, Eric Rosen,

  Ray Qiu, IJsbrand Wijnands, 2013-02-08,
  <draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-extranet-01.txt>

      Previous RFCs specify the procedures necessary to allow IP multicast
      traffic to travel from one site to another within a BGP/MPLS IP VPN
      (Virtual Private Network).  However, it is sometimes desirable to
      allow multicast traffic whose source is in one VPN to be received by
      systems that are in another VPN.  This is known as a "Multicast VPN
      (MVPN) extranet".  This document updates RFCs 6513, 6514, and 6625 by
      specifying the procedures that are necessary in order to provide MVPN
      extranet service.

      the Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) if deployed in the
      Internet.  This document proposes a set of recommendations to
      mitigate the identified security risks and keep a security level
      equivalent to what is observed in the Internet today (i.e., without

  "LISP Delegated Database Tree", Vince Fuller, Darrel Lewis, Vina
  Ermagan, Amit Jain, 2013-03-28, <draft-ietf-lisp-ddt-01.txt>

      This draft describes the LISP Delegated Database Tree (LISP-DDT), a
      hierarchical, distributed database which embodies the delegation of
      authority to provide mappings from LISP Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs)
      to Routing Locators (RLOCs).  It is a statically-defined distribution
      of the EID namespace among a set of LISP-speaking servers, called DDT
      nodes.  Each DDT node is configured as "authoritative" for one or
      more EID-prefixes, along with the set of RLOCs for Map Servers or
      "child" DDT nodes to which more-specific EID-prefixes are delegated.

  "An Architecural Introduction to the LISP Location-Identity Separation
  System", J. Chiappa, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-lisp-introduction-01.txt>

      LISP is an upgrade to the architecture of the IPvN internetworking
      system, one which separates location and identity (currently
      intermingled in IPvN addresses).  This is a change which has been
      identified by the IRTF as a critically necessary evolutionary
      architectural step for the Internet.  In LISP, nodes have both a
      'locator' (a name which says _where_ in the network's connectivity
      structure the node is) and an 'identifier' (a name which serves only
      to provide a persistent handle for the node).  A node may have more
      than one locator, or its locator may change over time (e.g. if the
      node is mobile), but it keeps the same identifier.
      
      One of the chief novelties of LISP, compared to other proposals for
      the separation of location and identity, is its approach to deploying
      this upgrade.  (In general, it is comparatively easy to conceive of
      new network designs, but much harder to devise approaches which will
      actually get deployed throughout the global network.)  LISP aims to
      achieve the near-ubiquitous deployment necessary for maximum
      exploitation of an architectural upgrade by i) minimizing the amount
      of change needed (existing hosts and routers can operate unmodified);
      and ii) by providing significant benefits to early adopters.
      
      This document is an introduction to the entire LISP system, for those
      who are unfamiliar with it.

  "An Architectural Perspective on the LISP Location-Identity Separation
  System", J. Chiappa, 2013-02-18, <draft-ietf-lisp-perspective-00.txt>

      LISP upgrades the architecture of the IPvN internetworking system by
      separating location and identity, current intermingled in IPvN
      addresses.  This is a change which has been identified by the IRTF as
      a critically necessary evolutionary architectural step for the
      Internet.  In LISP, nodes have both a 'locator' (a name which says
      _where_ in the network's connectivity structure the node is) and an
      'identifier' (a name which serves only to provide a persistent handle
      for the node).  A node may have more than one locator, or its locator
      may change over time (e.g. if the node is mobile), but it keeps the
      same identifier.
      
      This document gives additional architectural insight into LISP, and
      considers a number of aspects of LISP from a high-level standpoint.
      
      [NOTE: This is still a somewhat rough draft version; a few sections
      at the end are just rough frameworks, but almost all the key
      sections, and all the front part of the document, are here, and in
      something like reasonably complete form.]

Light-Weight Implementation Guidance (lwig)
-------------------------------------------

  "Guidance for Light-Weight Implementations of the Internet Protocol
  Suite", Carsten Bormann, 2013-02-25, <draft-ietf-lwig-guidance-03.txt>

      Implementation of Internet protocols on small devices benefits from
      light-weight implementation techniques, which are often not
      documented in an accessible way.
      
      This document provides a first outline of and some initial content
      for the Light-Weight Implementation Guidance document planned by the
      IETF working group LWIG.

  "Terminology for Constrained Node Networks", Carsten Bormann, Mehmet
  Ersue, Ari Keranen, 2013-07-09, <draft-ietf-lwig-terminology-05.txt>

      The Internet Protocol Suite is increasingly used on small devices
      with severe constraints, creating constrained node networks.  This
      document provides a number of basic terms that have turned out to be
      useful in the standardization work for constrained environments.

  "Minimal IKEv2", Tero Kivinen, 2013-04-11,
  <draft-ietf-lwig-ikev2-minimal-00.txt>

      This document describes minimal version of the Internet Key Exchange
      version 2 (IKEv2) protocol.  IKEv2 is a component of IPsec used for
      performing mutual authentication and establishing and maintaining
      Security Associations (SAs).  IKEv2 includes several optional
      features, which are not needed in minimal implementations.  This
      document describes what is required from the minimal implementation,
      and also describes various optimizations which can be done.  The
      protocol described here is compliant with full IKEv2 with exception
      that this document only describes shared secret authentication (IKEv2
      requires support for certificate authentication in addition to shared
      secret authentication).
      
      This document does not update or modify RFC 5996, but provides more
      compact description of the minimal version of the protocol.  If this
      document and RFC 5996 conflicts then RFC 5996 is the authoritative
      description.

Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (manet)
------------------------------

  "The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2", Thomas Clausen,
  Christopher Dearlove, Philippe Jacquet, Ulrich Herberg, 2013-03-23,
  <draft-ietf-manet-olsrv2-19.txt>

      This specification describes version 2 of the Optimized Link State
      Routing (OLSRv2) protocol for Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs).

  "Definition of Managed Objects for the Manet Simplified Multicast
  Framework Relay Set Process", Robert Cole, Joseph Macker, Brian Adamson,
  2013-03-21, <draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-07.txt,.pdf>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
      In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of the
      Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) process for Mobile Ad-Hoc
      Networks (MANETs).  The SMF-MIB also reports state information,
      performance metrics, and notifications.  In addition to
      configuration, the additional state and performance information is
      useful to operators troubleshooting multicast forwarding problems.

  "Definition of Managed Objects for the Optimized Link State Routing
  Protocol version 2", Ulrich Herberg, Robert Cole, Thomas Clausen,
  2013-06-24, <draft-ietf-manet-olsrv2-mib-12.txt>

      This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module
      for configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing
      protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).  The OLSRv2-MIB module is structured
      into configuration information, state information, performance
      information, and notifications.  This additional state and
      performance information is useful to troubleshoot problems and
      performance issues of the routing protocol.  Two levels of compliance
      allow this MIB module to be deployed on constrained routers.

  "Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP)", Stan Ratliff, Cisco Cisco, Greg
  Harrison, Darryl Satterwhite, Shawn Jury, 2013-03-25,
  <draft-ietf-manet-dlep-04.txt>

      When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over
      wireless links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the
      characteristics of the link (speed, state, etc.) in order to make
      forwarding decisions. In mobile or other environments where these
      characteristics change frequently, manual configurations or the
      inference of state through routing or transport protocols does not
      allow the router to make the best decisions. A bidirectional, event-
      driven communication channel between the router and the modem is
      necessary.

  "Security Threats for NHDP", Jiazi Yi, Ulrich Herberg, Thomas Clausen,
  2013-06-17, <draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-sec-threats-06.txt>

      This document analyzes common security threats of the Neighborhood
      Discovery Protocol (NHDP), and describes their potential impacts on
      MANET routing protocols using NHDP.  This document is not intended to
      propose solutions to the threats described.

  "Link Metrics for the Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Routing Protocol
  OLSRv2 - Rationale", Christopher Dearlove, Thomas Clausen, Philippe
  Jacquet, 2013-05-01, <draft-ietf-manet-olsrv2-metrics-rationale-04.txt>

      OLSRv2 includes the ability to assign metrics to links and to use
      those metrics to allow routing by other than minimum hop count
      routes.  This document provides a historic record of the rationale
      for, and design considerations behind, how link metrics were included
      in OLSRv2.

  "Dynamic MANET On-demand (AODVv2) Routing", Charles Perkins, Stan
  Ratliff, John Dowdell, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-manet-aodvv2-02.txt>

      The revised Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODVv2) routing
      protocol is intended for use by mobile routers in wireless, multihop
      networks.  AODVv2 determines unicast routes among AODVv2 routers
      within the network in an on-demand fashion, offering on-demand
      convergence in dynamic topologies.

  "Integrity Check Value and Timestamp TLV Definitions for Mobile Ad Hoc
  Networks (MANETs)", Ulrich Herberg, Thomas Clausen, Christopher
  Dearlove, 2013-07-30, <draft-ietf-manet-rfc6622-bis-04.txt>

      This document revises, extends and replaces RFC 6622.  It describes
      general and flexible TLVs for representing cryptographic Integrity
      Check Values (ICVs) and timestamps, using the generalized Mobile Ad
      Hoc Network (MANET) packet/message format defined in RFC 5444.  It
      defines two Packet TLVs, two Message TLVs, and two Address Block TLVs
      for affixing ICVs and timestamps to a packet, a message, and one or
      more addresses, respectively.

  "Integrity Protection for Control Messages in NHDP and OLSRv2", Ulrich
  Herberg, Christopher Dearlove, Thomas Clausen, 2013-07-02,
  <draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-olsrv2-sec-03.txt>

      This document specifies integrity and replay protection for the MANET
      Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) and the Optimized Link State
      Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).  This protection is achieved by
      using an HMAC-SHA-256 Integrity Check Value (ICV) TLV and a timestamp
      TLV based on POSIX time.
      
      The mechanism in this specification can also be used for other
      protocols that use the generalized packet/message format described in
      RFC 5444.
      
      This document updates RFC 6130 and RFC xxxx by mandating the
      implementation of this integrity and replay protection in NHDP and
      OLSRv2.

MBONE Deployment (mboned)
-------------------------

  "Automatic Multicast Tunneling", Gregory Bumgardner, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-mboned-auto-multicast-15.txt>

      This document describes Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT), a
      protocol for delivering multicast traffic from sources in a
      multicast-enabled network to receivers that lack multicast
      connectivity to the source network.  The protocol uses UDP
      encapsulation and unicast replication to provide this functionality.
      
      The AMT protocol is specifically designed to support rapid deployment
      by requiring minimal changes to existing network infrastructure.

  "Mtrace Version 2: Traceroute Facility for IP Multicast", Hitoshi
  Asaeda, Weesan Lee, 2013-07-08, <draft-ietf-mboned-mtrace-v2-10.txt>

      This document describes the IP multicast traceroute facility, named
      Mtrace version 2 (Mtrace2).  Unlike unicast traceroute, Mtrace2
      requires special implementations on the part of routers.  This
      specification describes the required functionality in multicast
      routers, as well as how an Mtrace2 client invokes a query and
      receives a reply.

  "IPv6 Multicast Address With Embedded IPv4 Multicast Address", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Jacni Qin, Yiu Lee, Stig Venaas, Xing Li, Mingwei Xu,
  2013-04-18, <draft-ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format-05.txt>

      This document reserves one bit (M-bit) of the unicast prefix-based
      multicast IPv6 address for ASM and an IPv6 multicast prefix for SSM
      mode to be used in the context of IPv4-IPv6 interconnection.
      
      The document specifies an algorithmic translation of an IPv6
      multicast address to a corresponding IPv4 multicast address, and vice
      versa.  This algorithmic translation can be used in both IPv4-IPv6
      translation or encapsulation schemes.

  "IPv4-IPv6 Multicast: Problem Statement and Use Cases", Christian
  Jacquenet, Mohamed Boucadair, Yiu Lee, Jacni Qin, Tina Tsou, Qiong Sun,
  2013-06-05, <draft-ietf-mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps-03.txt>

      This document discusses issues and requirements raised by IPv4-IPv6
      multicast interconnection and co-existence scenarios.  It also
      discusses various multicast use cases which may occur during IPv6
      transitioning.

  "Address Acquisition For Multicast Content When Source and Receiver
  Support Differing IP Versions", Tina Tsou, Axel Clauberg, Mohamed
  Boucadair, Stig Venaas, Qiong Sun, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-ietf-mboned-multrans-addr-acquisition-02.txt>

      Each IPTV operator has their own arrangements for pre-provisioning
      program information including addresses of the multicast groups
      corresponding to broadcast programs on the subscriber receiver.
      During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, scenarios can occur where
      the IP version supported by the receiver differs from that supported
      by the source.  This memo examines what has to be done to allow the
      receiver to acquire multicast address information in the version it
      supports in such scenarios.

  "Multicast in the Data Center Overview", Mike McBride, 2013-02-19,
  <draft-ietf-mboned-dc-deploy-00.txt>

      There has been much interest in issues surrounding massive amounts of
      hosts in the data center.  These issues include the prevalent use of
      IP Multicast within the Data Center.  Its important to understand how
      IP Multicast is being deployed in the Data Center to be able to
      understand the surrounding issues with doing so.  This document
      provides a quick survey of uses of multicast in the data center and
      should serve as an aid to further discussion of issues related to
      large amounts of multicast in the data center.

Media Server Control (mediactrl)
--------------------------------

  "Media Control Channel Framework (CFW) Call Flow Examples", Alessandro
  Amirante, Tobia Castaldi, Lorenzo Miniero, Simon Romano, 2013-05-23,
  <draft-ietf-mediactrl-call-flows-13.txt>

      This document provides a list of typical Media Control Channel
      Framework call flows.  It aims at being a simple guide to the use of
      the interface between Application Servers and MEDIACTRL-based Media
      Servers, as well as a base reference documentation for both
      implementors and protocol researchers.

Multiple Interfaces (mif)
-------------------------

  "Happy Eyeballs Extension for Multiple Interfaces", Gang Chen, Carl
  Williams, Dan Wing, Andrew Yourtchenko, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-mif-happy-eyeballs-extension-02.txt>

      Currently the interface selection in multi-interface environment is
      exclusive - only one interface can be used at the time, frequently
      needing manual intervention.  Happy Eyeballs in MIF would make the
      selection process smoother by using the connectivity checks over a
      pre-filtered interfaces according to defined policy.  This would
      choose "best" interface with an automatic fallback.

Managed Incident Lightweight Exchange (mile)
--------------------------------------------

  "IODEF-extension for structured cybersecurity information", Takeshi
  Takahashi, Kent Landfield, Tom Millar, Youki Kadobayashi, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-ietf-mile-sci-08.txt,.pdf>

      This document extends the Incident Object Description Exchange Format
      (IODEF) defined in RFC 5070 [RFC5070] to exchange enriched
      cybersecurity information among cybersecurity entities and facilitate
      their operations.  It provides the capability of embedding structured
      information, such as identifier- and XML-based information.

  "IODEF Usage Guidance", Panos Kampanakis, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-mile-iodef-guidance-01.txt>

      The Incident Object Description Exchange Format [RFC5070] defines a
      data representation that provides a framework for sharing information
      commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams
      (CSIRTs) about computer security incidents.  Since the IODEF model
      includes a wealth of available options that can be used to describe a
      security incident or issue, it can be challenging for implementers to
      develop tools that can Leverage IODEF for incident sharing.  This
      document provides guidelines for IODEF implementers.  It will also
      address how common security indicators can be represented in IODEF.
      The goal of this document is to make IODEF's adoption by vendors
      easier and encourage faster and wider adoption of the model by
      Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) around the world.

  "The Incident Object Description Exchange Format", Roman Danyliw, Paul
  Stoecker, 2013-05-05, <draft-ietf-mile-rfc5070-bis-00.txt>

      The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a
      data representation that provides a framework for sharing information
      commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams
      (CSIRTs) about computer security incidents.  This document describes
      the information model for the IODEF and provides an associated data
      model specified with XML Schema.

  "IODEF Enumeration Reference Format", Adam Montville, David Black,
  2013-07-30, <draft-ietf-mile-enum-reference-format-01.txt>

      The Incident Object Description Exchange Format [IODEF] provides a
      Reference class used to reference external entities (such as
      enumeration identifiers).  However, the method of external entity
      identification has been left unstructured.  This document describes a
      method to provide structure for referencing external entities for the
      [IODEF] Reference class.

Mobility for IPv4 (mip4)
------------------------

  "Flow Binding Support for Mobile IPv4", Sri Gundavelli, Kent Leung,
  George Tsirtsis, Hesham Soliman, Alexandru Petrescu, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-mip4-multiple-tunnel-support-06.txt>

      This specification defines extensions to Mobile IPv4 protocol for
      allowing a mobile node with multiple interfaces to register a care-of
      address for each of its network interfaces and to simultaneously
      establish multiple Mobile IP tunnels with its home agent.  This
      essentially allows the mobile node to utilize all the available
      network interfaces and build an higher aggregated data pipe with the
      home agent for its home address traffic.  Furthermore, these
      extensions also allow the mobile node and the home agent to negotiate
      flow policies for binding individual traffic flows with the
      registered care-of addresses.

Multiparty Multimedia Session Control (mmusic)
----------------------------------------------

  "Real Time Streaming Protocol 2.0 (RTSP)", Henning Schulzrinne, Anup
  Rao, Rob Lanphier, Magnus Westerlund, Martin Stiemerling, 2013-04-04,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis-34.txt>

      This memorandum defines RTSP version 2.0 which obsoletes RTSP version
      1.0 defined in RFC 2326.
      
      The Real Time Streaming Protocol, or RTSP, is an application-level
      protocol for setup and control of the delivery of data with real-time
      properties.  RTSP provides an extensible framework to enable
      controlled, on-demand delivery of real-time data, such as audio and
      video.  Sources of data can include both live data feeds and stored
      clips.  This protocol is intended to control multiple data delivery
      sessions, provide a means for choosing delivery channels such as UDP,
      multicast UDP and TCP, and provide a means for choosing delivery
      mechanisms based upon RTP (RFC 3550).

  "A Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal mechanism for media
  controlled by Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)", Jeff Goldberg,
  Magnus Westerlund, Thomas Zeng, 2013-05-27,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-rtsp-nat-16.txt>

      This document defines a solution for Network Address Translation
      (NAT) traversal for datagram based media streams setup and controlled
      with Real-time Streaming Protocol version 2 (RTSP 2.0).  It uses
      Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) adapted to use RTSP as a
      signalling channel, defining the necessary extra RTSP extensions and
      procedures.

  "The Evaluation of Different Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal
  Techniques for Media Controlled by Real-time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)",
  Magnus Westerlund, Thomas Zeng, 2013-05-29,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-rtsp-nat-evaluation-09.txt>

      This document describes several Network Address Translator (NAT)
      traversal techniques that were considered to be used for establishing
      the RTP media flows controlled by the Real-time Streaming Protocol
      (RTSP).  Each technique includes a description on how it would be
      used, the security implications of using it and any other deployment
      considerations it has.  There are also discussions on how NAT
      traversal techniques relates to firewalls and how each technique can
      be applied in different use cases.  These findings where used when
      selecting the NAT traversal for RTSP 2.0.

  "SDP: Session Description Protocol", Mark Handley, Van Jacobson, Colin
  Perkins, Ali Begen, 2013-03-11, <draft-ietf-mmusic-rfc4566bis-08.txt>

      This memo defines the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  SDP is
      intended for describing multimedia sessions for the purposes of
      session announcement, session invitation, and other forms of
      multimedia session initiation.  This document obsoletes RFC 4566.

  "Analysis of Middlebox Interactions for Signaling Protocol Communication
  along the Media Path", Brian Stucker, Hannes Tschofenig, Gonzalo
  Salgueiro, 2013-05-30, <draft-ietf-mmusic-media-path-middleboxes-07.txt>

      Middleboxes are defined as any intermediary box performing functions
      apart from normal, standard functions of an IP router on the data
      path between a source host and destination host.  Two such functions
      are network address translation and firewalling.
      
      When Application Layer Gateways, such as SIP entities, interact with
      NATs and firewalls, as described in the MIDCOM architecture, then
      problems may occur in the transport of media traffic when signaling
      protocol interaction takes place along the media path, as it is the
      case for recent key exchange proposals (such as DTLS-SRTP).  This
      document highlights problems that may arise.  Unfortunately, it is
      difficult for the end points to detect or predict problematic
      behavior and to determine whether the media path is reliably
      available for packet exchange.
      
      This document aims to summarize the various sources and effects of
      NAT and firewall control, the reasons that they exist, and possible
      means of improving their behavior to allow protocols that rely upon
      signaling along the media path to operate effectively.

  "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Extension For Setting Audio and
  Video Media Streams Over Circuit-Switched Bearers In The Public Switched
  Telephone Network (PSTN)", Miguel Garcia, Simo Veikkolainen, 2013-06-26,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-cs-21.txt>

      This memo describes use cases, requirements, and protocol extensions
      for using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer model
      for establishing audio and video media streams over circuit-switched
      bearers in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).

  "Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)-Based Media Transport in
  the Session Description Protocol (SDP)", Salvatore Loreto, Gonzalo
  Camarillo, 2013-06-30, <draft-ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp-04.txt>

      SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) is a transport protocol
      used to establish associations between two endpoints.  This document
      describes how to express media transport over SCTP in SDP (Session
      Description Protocol).  This document defines the 'SCTP', 'SCTP/DTLS'
      and 'DTLS/SCTP' protocol identifiers for SDP.

  "The Session Description Protocol (SDP) 'trafficclass' Attribute", James
  Polk, Subha Dhesikan, Paul Jones, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-traffic-class-for-sdp-04.txt>

      This document proposes a new Session Description Protocol (SDP)
      attribute to identify the traffic class a session is requesting
      in its offer/answer exchange.

  "Multiplexing Negotiation Using Session Description Protocol (SDP) Port
  Numbers", Christer Holmberg, Harald Alvestrand, Cullen Jennings,
  2013-06-14, <draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation-04.txt>

      This specification defines a new SDP Grouping Framework extension,
      "BUNDLE", that can be used with the Session Description Protocol
      (SDP) Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of bundled media,
      which refers to the usage of a single 5-tuple for media associated
      with multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" lines).

  "Miscellaneous Capabilities Negotiation in the Session Description
  Protocol (SDP)", Miguel Garcia, Simo Veikkolainen, Robert Gilman,
  2013-07-10, <draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-miscellaneous-caps-07.txt>

      SDP has been extended with a capability negotiation mechanism
      framework that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport protocols
      and attributes.  This framework has been extended with a media
      capabilities negotiation mechanism that allows endpoints to negotiate
      additional media-related capabilities.  This negotiation is embedded
      into the widely-used SDP offer/answer procedures.
      
      This memo extends the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow
      endpoints to negotiate three additional SDP capabilities.  In
      particular, this memo provides a mechanism to negotiate bandwidth
      ('b=' line), connection data ('c=' line), and session or media titles
      ('i=' line for each session or media).

  "Duplication Grouping Semantics in the Session Description Protocol",
  Ali Begen, Yiqun Cai, Heidi Ou, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-duplication-grouping-03.txt>

      Packet loss is undesirable for real-time multimedia sessions, but can
      occur due to congestion, or other unplanned network outages.  This is
      especially true for IP multicast networks, where packet loss patterns
      can vary greatly between receivers.  One technique that can be used
      to recover from packet loss without incurring unbounded delay for all
      the receivers is to duplicate the packets and send them in separate
      redundant streams.  This document defines the semantics for grouping
      redundant streams in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  The
      semantics defined in this document are to be used with the SDP
      Grouping Framework.  SSRC-level (Synchronization Source) grouping
      semantics are also defined in this document for RTP streams using
      SSRC multiplexing.

  "Delayed Duplication Attribute in the Session Description Protocol", Ali
  Begen, Yiqun Cai, Heidi Ou, 2013-05-27,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-delayed-duplication-02.txt>

      A straightforward approach to provide protection against packet
      losses due to network outages with a longest duration of T time units
      is to simply duplicate the original packets and send each copy
      separated in time by at least T time units.  This approach is
      commonly referred to as Time-shifted Redundancy, Temporal Redundancy
      or simply Delayed Duplication.  This document defines an attribute to
      indicate the presence of temporally redundant media streams and the
      duplication delay in the Session Description Protocol.

  "Latching: Hosted NAT Traversal (HNT) for Media in Real-Time
  Communication", Emil Ivov, Hadriel Kaplan, Dan Wing, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-latching-03.txt>

      This document describes behavior of signalling intermediaries in
      Real-Time Communication (RTC) deployments, sometimes referred to as
      Session Border Controllers (SBCs), when performing Hosted NAT
      Traversal (HNT).  HNT is a set of mechanisms, such as media relaying
      and latching, that such intermediaries use to enable other RTC
      devices behind NATs to communicate with each other.  This document is
      non-normative, and is only written to explain HNT in order to provide
      a reference to the IETF community, as well as an informative
      description to manufacturers, and users.

  "Offer/Answer Considerations for G723 Annex A and G729 Annex B", Muthu
  Perumal, Parthasarathi Ravindran, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-g723-g729-04.txt>

      RFC4856 describes the annexa parameter for G723 and the annexb
      parameter for G729, G729D and G729E. However, the specification does
      not describe the offerer and answerer behavior when the value of the
      annexa or annexb parameter does not match in the Session Description
      protocol(SDP) offer and answer.  This document provides the offer/
      answer considerations for these parameters and updates RFC4856.

  "Cross Session Stream Identification in the Session Description
  Protocol", Harald Alvestrand, 2013-02-10,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-msid-00.txt>

      This document specifies a grouping mechanism for RTP media streams
      that can be used to specify relations between media streams within
      different RTP sessions as well as within a single RTP session, and
      independently of whether these media streams are described within one
      SDP m-line or in multiple m-lines.
      
      This mechanism is used to signal the association between the RTP
      concept of SSRC and the WebRTC concept of "MediaStream" /
      "MediaStreamTrack" using SDP signaling.

  "Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network
  Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols", Ari
  Keranen, Jonathan Rosenberg, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-mmusic-rfc5245bis-00.txt>

      This document describes a protocol for Network Address Translator
      (NAT) traversal for UDP-based multimedia sessions established with
      the offer/answer model.  This protocol is called Interactive
      Connectivity Establishment (ICE).  ICE makes use of the Session
      Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol and its extension,
      Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN).  ICE can be used by any protocol
      utilizing the offer/answer model, such as the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP).
      
      This document obsoletes RFC 5245.

Multiprotocol Label Switching (mpls)
------------------------------------

  "A Thesaurus for the Terminology used in Multiprotocol Label Switching
  Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) drafts/RFCs and ITU-T's Transport Network
  Recommendations.", Huub van Helvoort, Loa Andersson, Nurit Sprecher,
  2013-07-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-rosetta-stone-11.txt>

      MPLS-TP is based on a profile of the MPLS and PW procedures as
      specified in the MPLS-TE and (MS-)PW architectures developed by the
      IETF.  The ITU-T has specified a Transport Network architecture.
      
      This document provides a thesaurus for the interpretation of MPLS-TP
      terminology within the context of the ITU-T Transport Network
      recommendations.
      
      It is important to note that MPLS-TP is applicable in a wider set of
      contexts than just Transport Networks.  The definitions presented in
      this document do not provide exclusive nor complete interpretations
      of MPLS-TP concepts.  This document simply allows the MPLS-TP terms
      to be applied within the Transport Network context.

  "Return Path Specified LSP Ping", Mach Chen, Wei Cao, So Ning, Frederic
  JOUNAY, Simon DeLord, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-return-path-specified-lsp-ping-12.txt>

      This document defines extensions to the failure-detection protocol
      for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
      known as "LSP Ping" that allow selection of the LSP to use for the
      echo reply return path.  Enforcing a specific return path can be used
      to verify bidirectional connectivity and also increase LSP ping
      robustness.  It may also be used by Bidirectional Forwarding
      Detection (BFD) for MPLS bootstrap signaling thereby making BFD for
      MPLS more robust.

      The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) specification defines
      procedures to exchange label bindings over either IPv4, or IPv6 or
      both networks. This document corrects and clarifies the LDP behavior
      when IPv6 network is used (with or without IPv4). This document

  "Seamless MPLS Architecture", Nicolai Leymann, Bruno Decraene, Clarence
  Filsfils, Maciek Konstantynowicz, Dirk Steinberg, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls-04.txt>

      This documents describes an architecture which can be used to extend
      MPLS networks to integrate access and aggregation networks into a
      single MPLS domain ("Seamless MPLS").  The Seamless MPLS approach is
      based on existing and well known protocols.  It provides a highly
      flexible and a scalable architecture and the possibility to integrate
      100.000 of nodes.  The separation of the service and transport plane
      is one of the key elements; Seamless MPLS provides end to end service
      independent transport.  Therefore it removes the need for service
      specific configurations in network transport nodes (without end to
      end transport MPLS, some additional services nodes/configurations
      would be required to glue each transport domain).  This draft defines
      a routing architecture using existing standardized protocols.  It
      does not invent any new protocols or defines extensions to existing
      protocols.

  "Inter-Area P2MP Segmented LSPs", Yakov Rekhter, Rahul Aggarwal,
  2013-05-14, <draft-ietf-mpls-seamless-mcast-07.txt>

      This document describes procedures for building inter-area point-to-
      multipoint (P2MP) segmented service LSPs by partitioning such LSPs
      into intra-area segments and using BGP as the inter-area routing and
      label distribution protocol. Within each IGP area the intra-area
      segments are either carried over intra-area P2MP LSPs, using P2MP LSP
      hierarchy, or instantiated using ingress replication.  The intra-area
      P2MP LSPs may be signaled using P2MP RSVP-TE or P2MP mLDP. If ingress
      replication is used within an IGP area, then MP2P LDP LSPs or P2P
      RSVP-TE LSPs may be used in the IGP area. The applications/services
      that use such inter-area service LSPs may be BGP MVPN, VPLS
      multicast, or global table multicast over MPLS.

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
      In particular, it describes managed objects of Tunnels, Identifiers,
      Label Switch Router and Textual conventions for Multiprotocol Label

  "Disabling IPoMPLS and P2P PW LDP Application's State Advertisement",
  Kamran Raza, Sami Boutros, 2013-06-20,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-ip-pw-capability-06.txt>

      Currently, no LDP capability is exchanged for LDP applications like
      IP Label Switching and L2VPN P2P PW signaling. When an LDP session
      comes up, an LDP speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state
      for such LDP applications even when the peer session is established
      for some other applications like mLDP or ICCP. This document defines
      a solution by which an LDP speaker announces to its peer its
      disinterest in such non-negotiated applications. This, in turn,
      disables the advertisement of corresponding application state, which
      would have otherwise be advertised by default, over the established
      LDP session.

  "Definition of Time-to-Live TLV for LSP-Ping Mechanisms", Sami Boutros,
  Siva Sivabalan, George Swallow, Shaleen Saxena, Vishwas Manral, Sam
  Aldrin, 2013-04-20, <draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-ttl-tlv-05.txt>

      LSP-Ping is a widely deployed Operation, Administration, and
      Maintenance (OAM) mechanism in MPLS networks. However, in the present
      form, this mechanism is inadequate to verify connectivity of a
      segment of a Multi-Segment PseudoWire (MS-PW) from any node on the
      path of the MS-PW. This document defines a TLV to address this
      shortcoming.

  "LDP Extensions for Multi Topology Routing", Quintin Zhao, Luyuan Fang,
  Chao Zhou, Lianyuan Li, Kamran Raza, 2013-05-13,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology-08.txt>

      Multi-Topology (MT) routing is supported in IP networks with the use
      of MT aware IGP protocols.  In order to provide MT routing within
      Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Distribution Protocol
      (LDP) networks new extensions are required.  This document updates
      RFC4379.
      
      This document describes the LDP protocol extensions required to
      support MT routing in an MPLS environment.

  "Performance-based Path Selection for Explicitly Routed LSPs using TE
  Metric Extensions", Alia Atlas, John Drake, Spencer Giacalone, David
  Ward, Stefano Previdi, Clarence Filsfils, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-atlas-mpls-te-express-path-03.txt>

      In certain networks, it is critical to consider network performance
      criteria when selecting the path for an explicitly routed RSVP-TE
      LSP.  Such performance criteria can include latency, jitter, and loss
      or other indications such as the conformance to link performance
      objectives and non-RSVP TE traffic load.  This specification uses
      network performance data, such as is advertised via the OSPF and ISIS
      TE metric extensions (defined outside the scope of this document) to
      perform such path selections.

      This document specifies the procedures and protocol extensions for
      the protection of mLDP nodes within Multi-Protocol Label Switching
      (MPLS) networks using P2MP backup LSPs.

  "Per-Interface MIP Addressing Requirements and Design Considerations",
  Adrian Farrel, Hideki Endo, Rolf Winter, Yoshinori Koike, Manuel Paul,
  2013-07-31, <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mip-mep-map-08.txt>

      The Framework for Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)
      within the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) describes how Maintenance
      Entity Group Intermediate Points (MIPs) may be situated within
      network nodes at the incoming and outgoing interfaces.
      
      This document elaborates on important considerations for internal MIP
      addressing.  More precisely it describes important restrictions for
      any mechanism that specifies a way of forming OAM messages so that
      they can be targeted at MIPs on incoming or MIPs on outgoing
      interfaces and forwarded correctly through the forwarding engine.
      Furthermore, the document includes considerations for node
      implementations where there is no distinction between the incoming
      and outgoing MIP.

  "LDP Downstream-on-Demand in Seamless MPLS", Thomas Beckhaus, Bruno
  Decraene, Kishore Tiruveedhula, Maciek Konstantynowicz, Luca Martini,
  2013-07-13, <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-dod-09.txt>

      Seamless MPLS design enables a single IP/MPLS network to scale over
      core, metro and access parts of a large packet network infrastructure
      using standardized IP/MPLS protocols.  One of the key goals of
      Seamless MPLS is to meet requirements specific to access, including
      high number of devices, their position in network topology and their
      compute and memory constraints that limit the amount of state access
      devices can hold.This can be achieved with LDP Downstream-on-Demand
      (LDP DoD) label advertisement.  This document describes LDP DoD use
      cases and lists required LDP DoD procedures in the context of
      Seamless MPLS design.
      
      In addition, a new optional TLV type in the LDP Label Request message
      is defined for fast-up convergence.

  "MPLS-TP Next-Hop Ethernet Addressing", Dan Frost, Stewart Bryant,

  <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing-08.txt>

      The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
      is the set of MPLS protocol functions applicable to the construction
      and operation of packet-switched transport networks.  This document
      presents considerations for link-layer addressing of Ethernet frames
      carrying MPLS-TP packets.

  "MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) Advertisement Protocol", Dan
  Frost, Stewart Bryant, Matthew Bocci, 2013-06-07,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-gach-adv-08.txt>

      The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) provides an auxiliary
      logical data channel associated with a Label Switched Path (LSP), a
      pseudowire, or a section (link) over which a variety of protocols may
      flow.  These protocols are commonly used to provide Operations,
      Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms associated with the
      primary data channel.  This document specifies simple procedures by
      which an endpoint of an LSP, pseudowire, or section may inform the
      other endpoints of its capabilities and configuration parameters, or
      other application-specific information.  This information may then be
      used by the receiver to validate or adjust its local configuration,
      and by the network operator for diagnostic purposes.

  "mLDP Node Protection", IJsbrand Wijnands, Eric Rosen, Kamran Raza, Jeff
  Tantsura, Alia Atlas, Quintin Zhao, 2013-06-23,
  <draft-wijnands-mpls-mldp-node-protection-04.txt>

      This document describes procedures to support node protection for
      Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths
      (MP LSPs) built by LDP ("Label Distribution Protocol"), or simply
      mLDP.  In order to protect a node N, the Point of Local Repair (PLR)
      LSR of N must learn the Merge Point (MPT) LSR(s) of node N such that
      traffic can be redirected to them in case node N fails.  Redirecting
      the traffic around the failed node N depends on existing P2P LSPs
      originated from the PLR LSR to the MPT LSRs while bypassing LSR node
      N.

  "Temporal and hitless path segment monitoring", Alessandro D'Alessandro,
  Manuel Paul, Satoshi Ueno, Yoshinori Koike, 2013-05-07,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-temporal-hitless-psm-03.txt>

      The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized to enable
      carrier-grade packet transport and complement converged packet
      network deployments. Among the most attractive features of MPLS-TP
      are OAM functions, which enable network operators or service
      providers to provide various maintenance characteristics, such as
      fault location, survivability, performance monitoring, and
      preliminary or in-service measurements.
      
      One of the most important mechanisms which is common for transport
      network operation is fault location. A segment monitoring function of
      a transport path is effective in terms of extension of the
      maintenance work and indispensable particularly when the OAM function
      is effective only between end points. However, the current approach
      defined for MPLS-TP for the segment monitoring (SPME) has some fatal
      drawbacks. This document elaborates on the problem statement for the
      Sub-path Maintenance Elements (SPMEs) which provides monitoring of a
      portion of a set of transport paths (LSPs or MS-PWs). Based on the
      problems, this document specifies new requirements to consider a new
      improved mechanism of hitless transport path segment monitoring.
      
      This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
      Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
      Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
      capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

  "Using LDP Multipoint Extensions on Targeted LDP Sessions", Maria
  Napierala, Eric Rosen, 2013-06-24,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-targeted-mldp-02.txt>

      As specified in RFC 6388, Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be
      used to set up Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-
      Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths.  However, RFC 6388
      presupposes that the two endpoints of an LDP session are directly
      connected.  The LDP base specification (RFC 5036) allows for the case
      where the two endpoints of an LDP session are not directly connected;
      such a session is known as a "Targeted LDP" session.  This document
      provides the specification for using the LDP P2MP/MP2MP extensions
      over a Targeted LDP session.

  "MPLS-TP 1toN Protection", Eric Osborne, Fei Zhang, Yaacov Weingarten,
  2013-02-04, <draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1ton-protection-01.txt>

      As part of the Transport Profile for Multiprotocol Label Switching
      (MPLS-TP) there is a requirement to support 1:n linear protection for
      transport paths.  This requirement is further elaborated in RFC6372
      [SurvivFwk].  The basic protocol for linear protection, specified in
      RFC6378 [LinProt], is limited to 1+1 and 1:1 protection.  This
      document extends that protocol to address the additional
      functionality necessary to support scenarios where a single
      protection path is preconfigured to provide protection of multiple
      transport paths between two joint endpoints.
      
      This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
      Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
      Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
      capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
      defined by the ITU-T.

  "Applicability of LDP Label Advertisement Mode", Kamran Raza, Sami
  Boutros, Luca Martini, Nicolai Leymann, 2013-02-14,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-applicability-label-adv-01.txt>

      An LDP speaker negotiates the label advertisement mode with its LDP
      peer at the time of session establishment. Although different
      applications sharing the same LDP session may need different modes
      of label distribution and advertisement, there is only one type of
      label advertisement mode that is negotiated and used per LDP
      session. This document clarifies the use and the applicability of
      session's negotiated label advertisement mode, and categorizes LDP
      applications into two broad categories of negotiated mode-bound and
      mode-independent applications. The document updates RFC5036 and
      RFC4447 to remove any ambiguity and conflict in the area of using
      correct label advertisement mode for a given application.

  "LDP Extensions for Hub & Spoke Multipoint Label Switched Path", Lizhong
  Jin, Frederic JOUNAY, IJsbrand Wijnands, Nicolai Leymann, 2013-04-19,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-mldp-hsmp-01.txt>

      This draft introduces a hub & spoke multipoint LSP (short for HSMP
      LSP), which allows traffic both from root to leaf through P2MP LSP
      and also leaf to root along the co-routed reverse path.  That means
      traffic entering the HSMP LSP from application/customer at the root
      node travels downstream, exactly as if it was traveling downstream
      along a P2MP LSP to each leaf node, and traffic entering the HSMP LSP
      at any leaf node travels upstream along the tree to the root as if it
      is unicast to the root, except that it follows the path of the tree
      rather than ordinary unicast to the root.

  "Signaling RSVP-TE P2MP LSPs in an Inter-domain Environment", Zafar Ali,
  Rakesh Gandhi, Cisco Systems, Robert Venator, Yuji Kamite, 2013-04-12,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-inter-domain-p2mp-rsvp-te-lsp-01.txt>

      Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
      Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
      LSPs) are established using signaling procedures defined in
      [RFC4875]. However, [RFC4875] does not address several issues that
      arise when a P2MP-TE LSP is signaled in inter-domain networks. One
      such issue is the computation of a loosely routed inter-domain P2MP-
      TE LSP paths that are re-merge free. Another issue is the
      reoptimization of the inter-domain P2MP-TE LSP tree vs. an individual
      destination(s), since the loosely routing domain ingress border node
      is not aware of the reoptimization scope. This document defines the
      required protocol extensions needed for establishing and reoptimizing
      P2MP MPLS and GMPLS TE LSPs in inter-domain networks.

  "Encapsulating MPLS in UDP", KuiKe Building, Nischal Sheth, Lucy Yong,
  Carlos Pignataro, Fan Yongbing, 2013-06-08,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-in-udp-02.txt>

      Existing technologies to encapsulate Multi-Protocol Label Switching
      (MPLS) over IP are not adequate for efficient load balancing of MPLS
      application traffic, such as MPLS-based Layer2 Virtual Private
      Network (L2VPN) or Layer3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN) traffic
      across IP networks. This document specifies additional IP-based
      encapsulation technology, referred to as MPLS-in-User Datagram
      Protocol (UDP), which can facilitate the load balancing of MPLS
      application traffic across IP networks.

  Tom Petch, 2013-05-01,
  <draft-pac-mpls-lsp-ping-tlvs-and-sub-tlvs-registry-02.txt>

      This document addresses issues with the structure, allocation
      policies and clarity in the use of the "TLVs and sub-TLVs" of the
      "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
      Ping Parameters" in the "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture
      (MPLS)" name space.
      
      This document does not change any existing allocations and the new
      structure is backwards compatible with the existing registries.
      
      The policy for the allocation of TLVs is unchanged but future
      allocations of sub-TLVs will come from a single namespace, common to
      all TLVs of LSP Ping Parameters.

  "Use of Multipath with MPLS-TP and MPLS", Curtis Villamizar, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-multipath-use-00.txt>

      Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques and
      many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in
      very high bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core
      networks.  MPLS-TP has strongly discouraged the use of multipath
      techniques.  Some degradation of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot be
      avoided when operating over many types of multipath implementations.
      
      Using MPLS Entropy label, MPLS LSPs can be carried over multipath
      links while also providing a fully MPLS-TP compliant server layer for
      MPLS-TP LSPs.  This document describes the means of supporting MPLS
      as a server layer for MPLS-TP.  The use of MPLS-TP LSPs as a server
      layer for MPLS LSPs is also discussed.

  "Relayed Echo Reply mechanism for LSP Ping", Zhi Zheng, Lizhong Jin,
  Thomas Nadeau, George Swallow, 2013-03-10,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-relay-reply-00.txt>

      In some inter-AS and inter-area deployment scenarios for LSP Ping and
      Traceroute, a replying LSR may not have the available route to the
      initiator, and the Echo Reply message sent to the initiator would be
      discarded resulting in false negatives or complete failure of
      operation of LSP Ping and Traceroute.  This document describes
      extensions to LSP Ping mechanism to enable the replying LSR to have
      the capability to relay the echo response by a set of routable
      intermediate nodes to the initiator during the traceroute process in
      inter-AS and inter-area scenarios.

  "Requirements for MPLS Shared Mesh Protection", Yaacov Weingarten, Sam
  Aldrin, Ping Pan, Jeong-dong Ryoo, Greg Mirsky, 2013-03-26,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-smp-requirements-00.txt>

      This document presents the basic network objectives for the behavior
      of shared mesh protection (SMP) not based on control-plane support.
      This is an expansion of the basic requirements presented in the MPLS
      Transport Profile Requirements (RFC5654) and MPLS Transport Profile
      Survivability Framework (RFC6372) documents.  This document should be
      used as a basis for the definition of the mechanism that would be
      used to implement SMP for MPLS-TP data paths, in networks that do not
      employ a control plane for their operation.

  "MPLS Forwarding Compliance and Performance Requirements", Curtis
  Villamizar, Kireeti Kompella, Shane Amante, Andrew Malis, Carlos
  Pignataro, 2013-04-16, <draft-ietf-mpls-forwarding-00.txt>

      This document provides guidelines for implementors regarding MPLS
      forwarding and a basis for evaluations of forwarding implementations.
      Guidelines cover many aspects of MPLS forwarding.  Topics are
      highlighted where implementors might potentially overlook practical
      requirements which are unstated or underemphasized or are optional
      for conformance to RFCs.

  "Retiring TLVs from the Associated Channel Header of the MPLS Generic
  Associated Channel", Adrian Farrel, Stewart Bryant, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-retire-ach-tlv-03.txt>

      The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) is a generalization of
      the applicability of the Pseudowire (PW) Associated Channel Header
      (ACH).  RFC 5586 defines the concept of TLV constructs that can be
      carried in messages on the G-ACh by placing them in the ACH between
      the fixed header fields and the G-ACh message.  These TLVs are called
      ACH TLVs
      
      No Associated Channel Type yet defined uses an ACH TLV.  Furthermore,
      it is believed that handling TLVs in hardware introduces significant
      problems to the fast-path, and since G-ACh messages are intended to
      be processed substantially in hardware, the use of ACH TLVs is
      undesirable.
      
      This document updates RFC 5586 by retiring ACH TLVs and removing the
      associated registry.

  "Hub and Spoke Multipoint Label Switched Path Tunnels", Lizhong Jin,
  Frederic JOUNAY, Manav Bhatia, Sriganesh Kini, 2013-06-03,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-rsvp-te-hsmp-lsp-00.txt>

      There are applications that require bi-directional, co-routed and
      guaranteed communication from a root node to several leaf nodes in a
      hub and spoke fashion.  To meet such application requirements in a
      Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network this draft defines a
      Hub and Spoke Multipoint Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (HSMP
      TE LSP) with resource reservations for guaranteed communication.
      This draft also defines a protocol to setup such LSPs by re-using and
      extending P2MP RSVP-TE.

  "Allocating and Retiring Special Purpose MPLS Labels", Kireeti Kompella,
  Loa Andersson, Adrian Farrel, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-ietf-mpls-special-purpose-labels-03.txt>

      Some MPLS labels have been allocated for specific purposes.  A block
      of labels (0-15) has been set aside to this end, and are commonly
      called "reserved labels".  They will be called "special purpose
      labels" in this document.  As there are only 16 of these labels,
      caution is needed in the allocation of new special purpose labels,
      yet at the same time allow forward progress when one is called for.
      This memo defines some procedures to follow in the allocation and
      retirement of special purpose labels, as well as a method to extend
      the special purpose label space.  Finally, this memo renames the IANA
      registry for these labels to "Special Purpose MPLS Label Values", and
      creates a new one called the "Extended Special Purpose MPLS Label
      Values" registry.

  "Proxy MPLS Echo Request", George Swallow, Vanson Lim, Sam Aldrin,
  2013-07-05, <draft-ietf-mpls-proxy-lsp-ping-00.txt>

      This document defines a means of remotely initiating Multiprotocol
      Label Switched Protocol Pings on Label Switched Paths.  A proxy ping
      request is sent to any Label Switching Routers along a Label Switched
      Path.  The primary motivations for this facility are first to limit
      the number of messages and related processing when using LSP Ping in
      large Point-to-Multipoint LSPs, and second to enable leaf to leaf/
      root tracing.

Multicast Mobility (multimob)
-----------------------------

  "Mobile Multicast Sender Support in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) Domains",
  Thomas Schmidt, Shuai Gao, Hong-Ke Zhang, Matthias Waehlisch,
  2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-multimob-pmipv6-source-04.txt>

      Multicast communication can be enabled in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains
      via the Local Mobility Anchors by deploying MLD Proxy functions at
      Mobile Access Gateways, via a direct traffic distribution within an
      ISP's access network, or by selective route optimization schemes.
      This document describes the support of mobile multicast senders in
      Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains for all three scenarios.  Protocol
      optimizations for synchronizing PMIPv6 with PIM, as well as a peering
      function for MLD Proxies defined.  Mobile sources always remain
      agnostic of multicast mobility operations.

  "Multicast Mobility Routing Optimizations for Proxy Mobile IPv6", Juan
  Zuniga, Luis Contreras, Carlos Bernardos, Seil Jeon, Younghan Kim,
  2013-07-03, <draft-ietf-multimob-pmipv6-ropt-07.txt>

      A base solution to support IP multicasting in a PMIPv6 domain is
      specified in [RFC6224].  In this document, some enhancements to the
      base solution are described.  These enhancements include the use of a
      multicast tree mobility anchor as the topological anchor point for
      multicast traffic, as well as a direct routing option where the MAG
      can provide access to multicast content in the local network.  These
      enhancements provide benefits such as reducing multicast traffic
      replication and supporting different PMIPv6 deployment scenarios.

  "PMIPv6 multicast handover optimization by the Subscription Information
  Acquisition through the LMA (SIAL)", Luis Contreras, Carlos Bernardos,
  Ignacio Soto, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-ietf-multimob-handover-optimization-03.txt>

      This document specifies a multicast handover optimization mechanism
      for Proxy Mobile IPv6 to accelerate the delivery of multicast traffic
      to mobile nodes after handovers.  The mechanism is based on speeding
      up the acquisition of mobile nodes' multicast context by the mobile
      access gateways.  To do that, extensions to the current Proxy Mobile
      IPv6 protocol are proposed.  These extensions are not only applicable
      to the base solution for multicast support in Proxy Mobile IPv6, but
      they can also be applied to other solutions developed to avoid the
      tunnel convergence problem.  Furthermore, the extensions are also
      independent of the role played by the mobile access gateway within
      the multicast network (either acting as multicast listener discovery
      proxy or multicast router).

  "Multicast Listener Extensions for MIPv6 and PMIPv6 Fast Handovers",
  Thomas Schmidt, Matthias Waehlisch, Rajeev Koodli, Gorry Fairhurst,
  Dapeng Liu, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-multimob-fmipv6-pfmipv6-multicast-01.txt>

      Fast handover protocols for MIPv6 and PMIPv6 define mobility
      management procedures that support unicast communication at reduced
      handover latency.  Fast handover base operations do not affect
      multicast communication, and hence do not accelerate handover
      management for native multicast listeners.  Many multicast
      applications like IPTV or conferencing, though, are comprised of
      delay-sensitive real-time traffic and will benefit from fast handover
      execution.  This document specifies extension of the Mobile IPv6 Fast
      Handovers (FMIPv6) and the Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6
      (PFMIPv6) protocols to include multicast traffic management in fast
      handover operations.  This multicast support is provided first at the
      control plane by a management of rapid context transfer between
      access routers, second at the data plane by an optional fast traffic
      forwarding that may include buffering.

Network Complexity Research Group (ncrg)
----------------------------------------

  "A Framework for Defining Network Complexity", Michael Behringer, Geoff
  Huston, 2013-02-17, <draft-irtf-ncrg-complexity-framework-00.txt>

      Complexity is a widely used parameter in network design, yet there is
      no generally accepted definition of the term.  Complexity metrics
      exist in a wide range of research papers, but most of these address
      only a particular aspect of a network, for example the complexity of
      a graph or software.  There is a desire to define the complexity of a
      network as a whole, as deployed today to provide Internet services.
      This document provides a framework to guide research on the topic of
      network complexity.

Network Endpoint Assessment (nea)
---------------------------------

  "PT-EAP: Posture Transport (PT) Protocol For EAP Tunnel Methods", Nancy
  Cam-Winget, Paul Sangster, 2013-03-28, <draft-ietf-nea-pt-eap-09.txt>

      This document specifies PT-EAP, an Extensible Authentication Protocol
      (EAP) based Posture Transport (PT) protocol designed to be used only
      inside a TLS protected EAP tunnel method.  The document also
      describes the intended applicability of PT-EAP.

  Mohamad Badra, Alan Luchuk, Jürgen Schönwälder, 2013-05-10,
  <draft-ietf-netconf-rfc5539bis-03.txt>

      The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to
      install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices.
      This document describes how to use the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
      protocol to secure the exchange of NETCONF messages.  This document
      obsoletes RFC 5539.

  "Reverse Secure Shell (Reverse SSH)", Kent Watsen, 2013-06-21,
  <draft-ietf-netconf-reverse-ssh-01.txt>

      This memo presents a technique for a NETCONF server to initiate a SSH
      connection to a NETCONF client.  This is accomplished by the NETCONF
      client listening on IANA-assigned TCP port YYYY and starting the SSH
      client protocol immediately after accepting a TCP connection on it.
      This role-reversal is necessary as the NETCONF server must also be
      the SSH Server, in order for the NETCONF client to open the IANA-
      assigned SSH subsystem "netconf".

Network-Based Mobility Extensions (netext)
------------------------------------------

  "Logical Interface Support for multi-mode IP Hosts", Telemaco Melia, Sri
  Gundavelli, 2013-04-24,
  <draft-ietf-netext-logical-interface-support-07.txt>

      A Logical Interface is a software semantic internal to the host
      operating system.  This semantic is available in all popular
      operating systems and is used in various protocol implementations.
      The Logical Interface support is required on the mobile node
      operating in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, for leveraging various
      network-based mobility management features such as inter-technology
      handoffs, multihoming and flow mobility support.  This document
      explains the operational details of Logical Interface construct and
      the specifics on how the link-layer implementations hide the physical
      interfaces from the IP stack and from the network nodes on the
      attached access networks.  Furthermore, this document identifies the
      applicability of this approach to various link-layer technologies and
      analyzes the issues around it when used in context with various
      mobility management features.

  "Prefix Delegation Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6", Xingyue Zhou, Jouni
  Korhonen, Carl Williams, Sri Gundavelli, Carlos Bernardos, 2013-06-18,
  <draft-ietf-netext-pd-pmip-09.txt>

      This specification defines extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol
      for allowing a mobile router in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to obtain
      delegated IP prefixes for its attached mobile networks.  The mobility
      entities in the network will provide network-based mobility
      management support for those delegated IP prefixes just as how IP
      mobility support is provided for the mobile node's home address.
      Even as the mobile router performs a handoff and changes its network
      point of attachment, mobility support is ensured for all the
      delegated IP prefixes and for all the IP nodes in the mobile network
      that use IP address configuration from those delegated IP prefixes.

  "Proxy Mobile IPv6 Extensions to Support Flow Mobility", Carlos
  Bernardos, 2013-02-25, <draft-ietf-netext-pmipv6-flowmob-06.txt>

      Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node to connect to the same Proxy
      Mobile IPv6 domain through different interfaces.  However, the
      ability of movement of selected flows from one access technology to
      another is missing in the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol.  This
      document describes extensions to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol that
      are required to support network based flow mobility over multiple
      physical interfaces.
      
      The extensions required consist on the operations performed by the
      local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway to manage the
      prefixes assigned to the different interfaces of the mobile node, as
      well as how the forwarding policies are handled by the network to
      ensure consistent flow mobility management.

  "EAP Attributes for WiFi - EPC Integration", Ravi Valmikam, Rajeev
  Koodli, 2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-netext-wifi-epc-eap-attributes-03.txt>

      With WiFi beginning to establishing itself as a trusted access
      network for service providers, it has become important to provide
      functions commonly available in 3G and 4G networks in WiFi access
      networks.  Such functions include Access Point Name (APN) Selection,
      multiple Packet Data Network (PDN) connections and seamless mobility
      between WiFi and 3G/4G networks.
      
      EAP/AKA (and EAP/AKA') is standardized by 3GPP as the access
      authentication protocol for trusted access networks.  This IETF
      specification is required for mobile devices to access the 3GPP
      Evolved Packet Core (EPC) networks.  This document defines a few new
      EAP attributes and procedures to provide the above-mentioned
      functions in trusted WiFi access networks.

  "Quality of Service Option for Proxy Mobile IPv6", Marco Liebsch,
  Pierrick Seite, Hidetoshi Yokota, Jouni Korhonen, Sri Gundavelli,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-netext-pmip6-qos-03.txt>

      This specification defines a new mobility option that can be used by
      the mobility entities in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to exchange
      Quality of Service parameters associated with a subscriber's IP
      flows.  Using the QoS option, the local mobility anchor and the
      mobile access gateway can exchange available QoS attributes and
      associated values.  This enables QoS policing and labeling of packets
      to enforce QoS differentiation on the path between the local mobility
      anchor and the mobile access gateway.  Furthermore, making QoS
      parameters available on the MAG enables mapping these parameters to
      QoS rules being specific to the access technology which operates
      below the mobile access gateway.  After such mapping, QoS rules can
      be enforced on the access technology components, such as an IEEE
      802.11e Wireless LAN controller.

  "Update Notifications for Proxy Mobile IPv6", Suresh Krishnan, Sri
  Gundavelli, Marco Liebsch, Hidetoshi Yokota, Jouni Korhonen, 2013-06-17,
  <draft-ietf-netext-update-notifications-05.txt>

      This document specifies protocol enhancements for allowing the local
      mobility anchor in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to asynchronously
      notify the mobile access gateway about changes related to a mobility
      session.  These update notification messages are exchanged using a
      new Mobility Header message type specifically designed for this
      purpose.

  2013-07-04, <draft-ietf-netmod-interfaces-cfg-12.txt>

      This document defines a YANG data model for the management of network
      interfaces.  It is expected that interface type specific data models
      augment the generic interfaces data model defined in this document.
      The data model includes configuration data, state data and counters

  "A YANG Data Model for Routing Management", Ladislav Lhotka, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-ietf-netmod-routing-cfg-10.txt>

      This document contains a specification of three YANG modules.
      Together they form the core routing data model which serves as a
      framework for configuring and managing a routing subsystem.  It is
      expected that these modules will be augmented by additional YANG
      modules defining data models for individual routing protocols and
      other related functions.  The core routing data model provides common
      building blocks for such extensions - router instances, routes,
      routing tables, routing protocols and route filters.

      This document describes a filesystem federation protocol that enables
      file access and namespace traversal across collections of
      independently administered fileservers.  The protocol specifies a set
      of interfaces by which fileservers with different administrators can
      form a fileserver federation that provides a namespace composed of
      the filesystems physically hosted on and exported by the constituent
      fileservers.

  "Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Protocol", Tom, David Noveck,
  2013-05-08, <draft-ietf-nfsv4-rfc3530bis-26.txt>

      The Network File System (NFS) version 4 is a distributed filesystem
      protocol which owes heritage to NFS protocol version 2, RFC 1094, and
      version 3, RFC 1813.  Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4
      protocol supports traditional file access while integrating support
      for file locking and the mount protocol.  In addition, support for
      strong security (and its negotiation), compound operations, client
      caching, and internationalization have been added.  Of course,
      attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an
      Internet environment.
      
      This document, together with the companion XDR description document,
      RFCNFSv4XDR, obsoletes RFC 3530 as the definition of the NFS version
      4 protocol.

  David Noveck, Piyush Shivam, Chuck Lever, Bill Baker, 2013-03-21,
  <draft-ietf-nfsv4-migration-issues-03.txt>

      The migration feature of NFSv4 provides for moving responsibility for
      a single filesystem from one server to another, without disruption to
      clients.  Recent implementation experience has shown problems in the
      existing specification for this feature.  This document discusses the
      issues which have arisen, explores the options available for curing
      the issues, and explains the choices made in updating the NFSv4.0 and
      NFSv4.1 specifications, to address migration.

  "NFSv4.0 migration: Specification Update", David Noveck, Piyush Shivam,
  Chuck Lever, Bill Baker, 2013-02-15,
  <draft-ietf-nfsv4-rfc3530-migration-update-01.txt>

      The migration feature of NFSv4 allows for responsibility for a single
      filesystem to move from one server to another, without disruption to
      clients.  Recent implementation experience has shown problems in the
      existing specification for this feature in NFSv4.0.  This document
      clarifies and corrects the NFSv4.0 specification (RFC3530 and
      possible successors) to address these problems.

  "The ARK Identifier Scheme", John Kunze, R. Rodgers, 2013-04-05,
  <draft-kunze-ark-18.txt>

      The ARK (Archival Resource Key) naming scheme is designed to
      facilitate the high-quality and persistent identification of
      information objects.  A founding principle of the ARK is that
      persistence is purely a matter of service and is neither inherent in
      an object nor conferred on it by a particular naming syntax.  The
      best that an identifier can do is to lead users to the services that
      support robust reference.  The term ARK itself refers both to the
      scheme and to any single identifier that conforms to it.  An ARK has
      five components:
      
      [http://NMAH/]ark:/NAAN/Name[Qualifier]
      
      an optional and mutable Name Mapping Authority Hostport (usually a
      hostname), the "ark:" label, the Name Assigning Authority Number
      (NAAN), the assigned Name, and an optional and possibly mutable
      Qualifier supported by the NMA.  The NAAN and Name together form the
      immutable persistent identifier for the object independent of the URL
      hostname.  An ARK is a special kind of URL that connects users to
      three things: the named object, its metadata, and the provider's
      promise about its persistence.  When entered into the location field
      of a Web browser, the ARK leads the user to the named object.  That
      same ARK, inflected by appending a single question mark (`?'),
      returns a brief metadata record that is both human- and machine-
      readable.  When the ARK is inflected by appending dual question marks
      (`??'), the returned metadata contains a commitment statement from
      the current provider.  Tools exist for minting, binding, and
      resolving ARKs.

  "An IPv4 Flowlabel Option", Thomas Dreibholz, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-dreibholz-ipv4-flowlabel-18.txt>

      This draft defines an IPv4 option containing a flowlabel that is
      compatible to IPv6.  It is required for simplified usage of IntServ
      and interoperability with IPv6.

      ISO7816 standard, to EAP methods, fully and securely executed in
      smart cards. This class of tamper resistant device may deliver
      client or server services; it can compute Root Keys from an Extended
      Master Session Key (EMSK).

  "Reliable Server Pooling Applicability for IP Flow Information
  Exchange", Thomas Dreibholz, Lode Coene, Phillip Conrad, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-coene-rserpool-applic-ipfix-16.txt>

      This document describes the applicability of the Reliable Server
      Pooling architecture to the IP Flow Information Exchange using the
      Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP) functionality of RSerPool
      only.  Data exchange in IPFIX between the router and the data
      collector can be provided by a limited retransmission protocol.

  "Prepaid Extensions to Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
  (RADIUS)", Avi Lior, Parviz Yegani, Kuntal Chowdhury, Hannes Tschofenig,
  Andreas Pashalidis, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-lior-radius-prepaid-extensions-22.txt>

      This document specifies an extension to the Remote Authentication
      Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol that enables service providers
      to charge for prepaid services.  The supported charging models
      supported are volume-based, duration-based, and based on one-time
      events.

  "Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Packet Drop Reporting",
  Randall Stewart, Peter Lei, Michael Tuexen, 2013-04-17,
  <draft-stewart-sctp-pktdrprep-15.txt>

      This document describes a new chunk type for SCTP.  This new chunk
      type can be used by both endhosts and routers to report the loss of
      SCTP datagrams due to errors in transmission or other drops not due
      to congestion.

  "A NULL MX Resource Record for Domains that Accept No Mail", John
  Levine, Mark Delany, 2013-07-02, <draft-delany-nullmx-01.txt>

      When the 5321.MailFrom domain in an e-mail message has a DNS MX
      Resource Record (RR), it is making an explicit statement that it is
      willing to accept email.  However, when the domain has just a DNS A
      or AAAA RR, there mail clients cannot easily tell whether the domain
      accepts mail, as many hosts on the Internet advertise an A or AAAA RR
      regardless of whether they want to accept email.
      
      The NULL MX RR formalizes the existing mechanism by which a domain
      announces that it accepts no mail.

  "Applicability of Reliable Server Pooling for Real-Time Distributed
  Computing", Thomas Dreibholz, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-dreibholz-rserpool-applic-distcomp-15.txt>

      This document describes the applicability of the Reliable Server
      Pooling architecture to manage real-time distributed computing pools
      and access the resources of such pools.

  "Secure SCTP", Carsten Hohendorf, Esbold Unurkhaan, Thomas Dreibholz,
  2013-07-04, <draft-hohendorf-secure-sctp-16.txt>

      This document explains the reason for the integration of security
      functionality into SCTP, and gives a short description of S-SCTP and
      its services.  S-SCTP is fully compatible with SCTP defined in
      RFC4960, it is designed to integrate cryptographic functions into
      SCTP.

  "Operational Reliability for EDIINT AS2", John Duker, Dale Moberg,
  2013-04-17, <draft-duker-as2-reliability-13.txt>

      One goal of this document is to define approaches to achieve a "once
      and only once" delivery of messages. The EDIINT AS2 protocol [AS2] is
      implemented by a number of software tools on a variety of platforms
      with varying capabilities and with varying network service quality.
      Although the AS2 protocol defines a unique "Message-ID", current
      implementations of AS2 do not provide a standard method to prevent
      the same message (re-transmitted by the initial sender) from reaching
      back-end business applications at the initial receiver.
      
      A second goal is to reduce retransmissions and failures when AS2 is used
      in a synchronous mode for transmitting MDNs.  There can be a large
      latency between receipt of the POSTed entity body and the MDN response
      caused by the operations of decompressing, decrypting, and signature
      checks. Uncoordinated timeout policies and intermediate devices dropping
      connections have interfered with reliable data exchange. The use of an
      HTTP 102(Processing) status code is described to mitigate these
      difficulties. Use of these reliability features is indicated by
      presence of the "AS2-Reliability" value in the EDIINT-Features header.
      
      Intended Status
      
      The intent of this document is to be placed on the RFC track as an
      Informational RFC.

  "Private Header (P-Header) Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP) for the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)", Keith Drage,
  Christer Holmberg, Roland Jesske, 2013-03-15,
  <draft-drage-sipping-rfc3455bis-08.txt>

      This document describes a set of private Session Initiation Protocol
      (SIP) header fields (P-headers) used by the 3rd-Generation
      Partnership Project (3GPP), along with their applicability, which is
      limited to particular environments.  The P-header fields are for a
      variety of purposes within the networks that the partners use,
      including charging and information about the networks a call
      traverses.

  "Applicability of Reliable Server Pooling for SCTP-Based Endpoint
  Mobility", Thomas Dreibholz, Jobin Pulinthanath, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-dreibholz-rserpool-applic-mobility-14.txt>

      This document describes a novel mobility concept based on a
      combination of SCTP with Dynamic Address Reconfiguration extension
      and Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool).

  "Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) Bakeoff Scoring", Thomas Dreibholz,
  Michael Tuexen, 2013-07-04, <draft-dreibholz-rserpool-score-13.txt>

      This memo describes some of the scoring to be used in the testing of
      Reliable Server Pooling protocols ASAP and ENRP at upcoming bakeoffs.

  "Distributed DNS Implementation in IpV6", Lican Huang, 2013-01-30,
  <draft-licanhuang-dnsop-distributeddns-13.txt>

      This file is a proposal for P2P based Domain Name query strategy in 
      IpV6.  The DNS servers construct n-tuple overlay virtual hierarchical 
      overlay network.  With cached addresses of DNS servers, the overload of 
      traffic in tree structure can be avoided and more security can be  
      enhanced due to the random lookup paths. This strategy may use for 
      Domain Name query and reverse Domain Name query in IpV6 for a large 
      number of domain names.

  "Using Saratoga with a Bundle Agent as a Convergence Layer for Delay-
  Tolerant Networking", Lloyd Wood, Jim McKim, Wesley Eddy, Will Ivancic,
  Chris Jackson, 2013-04-21, <draft-wood-dtnrg-saratoga-12.txt>

      Saratoga is a simple, lightweight, UDP-based transfer protocol.  This
      describes how to use Saratoga as a Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN)
      "convergence layer" with the Bundle Protocol and its Bundle Agents,
      building on the Saratoga specification in draft-wood-tsvwg-saratoga.

  "Handle Resolution Option for ASAP", Thomas Dreibholz, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-dreibholz-rserpool-asap-hropt-13.txt>

      This document describes the Handle Resolution option for the ASAP
      protocol.

  "Definition of a Delay Measurement Infrastructure and Delay-Sensitive
  Least-Used Policy for Reliable Server Pooling", Thomas Dreibholz, Xing
  Zhou, 2013-07-04, <draft-dreibholz-rserpool-delay-12.txt>

      This document contains the definition of a delay measurement
      infrastructure and a delay-sensitive Least-Used policy for Reliable
      Server Pooling.

  "The Lightweight Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Support
  Protocol (LGSP)", Carlo Kopp, Mike Tyson, 2007-12-21,
  <draft-tyson-lgsp-01.txt>

      This document presents the Lightweight GNSS (Global Navigation
      Satellite System) Support Protocol (LGSP).  The Lightweight GNSS
      Support Protocol (LGSP) is being developed in order to provide a
      comprehensive solution which solves the problems inherent in
      traditional radio-based Differential GPS (DGPS) protocols.  LGSP will
      also provide additional support for GNSS user equipment, such as a
      GPS almanac retrieval method, allowing compatible units to perform
      faster almanac acquisition, thus resulting in less time until an
      initial position measurement can be established.  Other supporting
      features include alternative distribution of GPS navigation messages
      and differential correction messages, a hierarchical mirroring
      architecture, redundant backup operation and load balancing
      functions.

  "Saratoga: A Scalable Data Transfer Protocol", Lloyd Wood, Wesley Eddy,
  Charles Smith, Will Ivancic, Chris Jackson, 2013-04-21,
  <draft-wood-tsvwg-saratoga-13.txt>

      This document specifies the Saratoga transfer protocol.  Saratoga was
      originally developed to transfer remote-sensing imagery efficiently
      from a low-Earth-orbiting satellite constellation, but is useful for
      many other scenarios, including ad-hoc peer-to-peer communications,
      delay-tolerant networking, and grid computing.  Saratoga is a simple,
      lightweight, content dissemination protocol that builds on UDP, and
      optionally uses UDP-Lite.  Saratoga is intended for use when moving
      files or streaming data between peers which may have permanent,
      sporadic or intermittent connectivity, and is capable of transferring
      very large amounts of data reliably under adverse conditions.  The
      Saratoga protocol is designed to cope with highly asymmetric link or
      path capacity between peers, and can support fully-unidirectional
      data transfer if required.  Saratoga can also cope with very large
      files for exascale computing.  In scenarios with dedicated links,
      Saratoga focuses on high link utilization to make the most of limited
      connectivity times, while standard congestion control mechanisms can
      be implemented for operation over shared links.  Loss recovery is
      implemented via a simple negative-ack ARQ mechanism.  The protocol
      specified in this document is considered to be appropriate for
      experimental use on private IP networks.

  "Session Initiation Protocol Service Example -- Music on Hold", Dale
  Worley, 2013-06-25, <draft-worley-service-example-13.txt>

      The "music on hold" feature is one of the most desired features of
      telephone systems in the business environment.  "Music on hold" is
      where, when one party to a call has the call "on hold", that party's
      telephone provides an audio stream (often music) to be heard by the
      other party.  Architectural features of SIP make it difficult to
      implement music-on-hold in a way that is fully compliant with the
      standards.  The implementation of music-on-hold described in this
      document is fully effective and standards-compliant, and has a number
      of advantages over the methods previously documented.  In particular,
      it is less likely to produce peculiar user interface effects and more
      likely to work in systems which perform authentication than the
      music-on-hold method described in section 2.3 of RFC 5359.

  "The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) DNS Resource Record", Patrik
  Fältström, Olaf Kolkman, 2013-07-05, <draft-faltstrom-uri-08.txt>

      This document defines a new DNS resource record, called the Uniform
      Resource Identifier (URI) RR, for publishing mappings from hostnames
      to URIs.
      
      This document updates RFC 3958 and RFC 3404.

  "6LoWPAN Backbone Router", Pascal Thubert, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-thubert-6lowpan-backbone-router-03.txt>

      Some LLN subnets are expected to scale up to the thousands of nodes
      and hundreds of routers.  This paper proposes an IPv6 version of the
      Backbone Router concept that enables such a degree of scalability
      using a high speed network as a backbone to the subnet.

  "The BagIt File Packaging Format (V0.97)", Andy Boyko, John Kunze,
  Justin Littman, Liz Madden, Brian Vargas, 2013-04-05,
  <draft-kunze-bagit-09.txt>

      This document specifies BagIt, a hierarchical file packaging format
      for storage and transfer of arbitrary digital content.  A "bag" has
      just enough structure to enclose descriptive "tags" and a "payload"
      but does not require knowledge of the payload's internal semantics.
      This BagIt format should be suitable for disk-based or network-based
      storage and transfer.

  "PCEP extensions for a BGP/MPLS IP-VPN", Kenji Kumaki, Tomoki Murai,
  Dhruv Dhody, PENG JIANG, 2013-04-26,
  <draft-kumaki-murai-pce-pcep-extension-l3vpn-11.txt>

      IP Virtual Private Networks (IP-VPNs) allow Service Providers to
      offer customers connectivity between sites across an IP Backbone.
      These VPNs can be supported using BGP/MPLS and the connections can be
      created by using MPLS Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switched Paths
      (LSPs). The paths of these LSPs must be computed to provide the
      connectivity between customer sites. Path selection may be dependent
      on a variety of factors including traffic engineering constraints
      and bandwidth requirements.
      
      It is highly desirable for VPN customers to be able to dynamically
      establish their MPLS TE LSPs for interconnectivity between BGP/MPLS
      IP-VPN sites. The Path Computation Element (PCE) can determine the
      optimal paths of TE LSPs within an MPLS network. This document
      defines how to extend the PCEP to support the dynamic creation of
      MPLS TE LSPs between BGP/MPLS IP-VPN sites.

  "Labels for Common Location-Based Services", Andrea Forte, Henning
  Schulzrinne, 2010-01-15,
  <draft-forte-ecrit-service-classification-03.txt>

      This document creates a registry for describing the types of services
      available at a specific location.  The registry is expected to be
      referenced by other protocols that need a common set of service terms
      as protocol constants.  In particular, we define location-based
      service
      as either a point at a specific geographic location (e.g.,
      bus stop) or
      a service covering a specific region (e.g., pizza
      delivery).

  "BGP Extended Community for QoS Marking", Thomas Knoll, 2013-07-10,
  <draft-knoll-idr-qos-attribute-12.txt>

      This document specifies a simple signalling mechanism for inter-
      domain QoS marking using several instances of a new BGP Extended
      Community.  Class based packet marking and forwarding is currently
      performed independently within ASes.  The new QoS marking community
      makes the targeted Per Hop Behaviour within the IP prefix advertising
      AS and the currently applied marking at the interconnection point
      known to all access and transit ASes.  This enables individual
      (re-)marking and possibly forwarding treatment adaptation to the
      original QoS class setup of the respective originating AS.  The
      extended community provides the means to signal QoS markings on
      different layers, which are linked together in QoS Class Sets.  It
      provides inter-domain and cross-layer insight into the QoS class
      mapping of the source AS with minimal signalling traffic.

  "Internet Protocol-based In-Vehicle Emergency Call", Brian Rosen, Hannes
  Tschofenig, Randy, 2013-07-14, <draft-rosen-ecrit-ecall-10.txt>

      This document describes how to re-use the emergency services
      mechanisms specified for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to
      accomplishing emergency calling support in vehicles.  Profiling and
      simplifications are possible due to the nature of the functionality
      that is going to be provided in vehicles with the usage of Global
      Positioning System (GPS).

  "BGP Class of Service Interconnection", Thomas Knoll, 2013-05-11,
  <draft-knoll-idr-cos-interconnect-10.txt>

      This document focuses on Class of Service Interconnection at inter-
      domain interconnection points.  It specifies two new transitive
      attributes, which enable adjacent peers to signal Class of Service
      Capabilities and certain Class of Service admission control
      Parameters.  The new "CoS Capability" is deliberately kept simple and
      denotes the general EF, AF Group BE and LE forwarding support across
      the advertising AS.  The second "CoS Parameter Attribute" is of
      variable length and contains a more detailed description of available
      forwarding behaviours using the PHB id Code encoding.  Each PHB id
      Code is associated with rate and size based traffic parameters, which
      will be applied in the ingress AS Border Router for admission control
      purposes to a given forwarding behaviour.

  "RSVP-TE Recovery Extension for data plane initiated reversion,
  protection timer and SNC options signalling", Attila Takacs, Francesco
  Fondelli, Benoit Tremblay, Zafar Ali, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-takacs-ccamp-revertive-ps-08.txt>

      RSVP-TE recovery extensions are specified in [RFC4872] and
      [RFC4873].  Currently recovery signalling does not support the
      request for revertive protection, recovery timers values, and
      sub-network connection (SNC) protection options. This document
      extends the PROTECTION Object format allowing sub-TLVs, and
      defines three sub-TLVs to carry wait-to-restore and hold-off
      intervals and SNC protection options.

  "Definitions of Textual Conventions (TCs) for Multiprotocol Label
  Switching (MPLS) Management", Vishwas Manral, Tina Tsou, Will Liu,
  Francesco Fondelli, 2013-06-27, <draft-manral-mpls-rfc3811bis-03.txt>

      This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module which
      contains Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Multiprotocol
      Label Switching (MPLS) management information.  The intent is that
      these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in MPLS
      related MIB modules that would otherwise define their own
      representations.
      
      This document obsoletes RFC3811 as it addresses the need to support
      IPv6 extended TunnelID's by defining a new TC-
      MplsNewExtendedTunnelID which suggests using IPv4 address of the
      ingress or egress LSR for the tunnel for an IPv6 network.  Changes
      from RFC3811 and the effect of the new TC to other related documents
      are summarized in Section 4 and 5, respectively.

  "Information Model for Impaired Optical Path Validation", Young Lee,
  Greg Bernstein, Xian Zhang, 2013-02-20,
  <draft-bernstein-wson-impairment-info-06.txt>

      This document provides an information model for the optical
      impairment characteristics of optical network elements for use in
      GMPLS/PCE control plane protocols and mechanisms. This information
      model supports Impairment Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment
      (IA-RWA) in optical networks in which path computation and optical
      path validation are essential components. This is not a general
      network management information model.
      
      This model is based on ITU-T defined optical network element
      characteristics as given in ITU-T recommendation G.680 and related
      specifications. This model is intentionally compatible with a
      previous impairment free optical information model used in optical
      path computations and wavelength assignment.

  "Healthy Food and Special Dietary Requirements for IETF meetings", Mary
  Barnes, 2013-07-16, <draft-barnes-healthy-food-07.txt>

      This document describes the basic requirements for food for folks
      that attend IETF meetings require special diets, as well as those
      that prefer to eat healthy.  While, the variety of special diets is
      quite broad, the most general categories are described.  There can be
      controversy as to what constitutes healthy eating, but there are some
      common, generally available foods that comprise the basis for healthy
      eating and special diets.  This document provides some
      recommendations to meeting planners, as well as participants, in
      handling these requirements.

  "Extreme Networks' Ethernet Automatic Protection Switching (EAPS),
  Version 1.3", Arnel Lim, Steven Blake, Sunil Shah, 2011-07-05,
  <draft-shah-extreme-rfc3619bis-02.txt>

      This document describes version 1.3 of the Ethernet Automatic
      Protection Switching (EAPS) (TM) technology invented by Extreme
      Networks to increase the availability and robustness of Ethernet
      rings.  An Ethernet ring built using EAPS can have resilience
      comparable to that provided by SONET rings, at lower cost and without
      some of the constraints (e.g. ring size) of SONET.

  "Takeover Suggestion Flag for the ENRP Handle Update Message", Thomas
  Dreibholz, Xing Zhou, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-dreibholz-rserpool-enrp-takeover-10.txt>

      This document describes the Takeover Suggestion Flag for the
      ENRP_HANDLE_UPDATE message of the ENRP protocol.

  "Information Encoding for Impaired Optical Path Validation", Greg
  Bernstein, Young Lee, Xian Zhang, 2013-02-21,
  <draft-bernstein-wson-impairment-encode-02.txt>

      This document provides an information encoding for the optical
      impairment characteristics of optical network elements for use in
      path computation and optical path impairment validation. This
      encoding is based on ITU-T defined optical network element
      characteristics as given in ITU-T recommendation G.680 and related
      specifications. This encoding is intentionally compatible with a
      previous impairment free optical information encoding used in

  "The Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL)", Fred
  Templin, 2013-08-02, <draft-templin-intarea-seal-61.txt>

      This document specifies a Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation
      Layer (SEAL).  SEAL operates over virtual topologies configured over
      connected IP network routing regions bounded by encapsulating border
      nodes.  These virtual topologies are manifested by tunnels that may
      span multiple IP and/or sub-IP layer forwarding hops, where they may
      incur packet duplication, packet reordering, source address spoofing
      and traversal of links with diverse Maximum Transmission Units
      (MTUs).  SEAL addresses these issues through the encapsulation and
      messaging mechanisms specified in this document.

  "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Communication
  Diversion Information in support of the Communication Diversion (CDIV)
  Notification (CDIVN) CDIV service", John-Luc Bakker, Ranjit Avasarala,
  2013-07-12, <draft-avasarala-dispatch-comm-div-notification-12.txt>

      3GPP and TISPAN are defining the protocol specification for the
      Communication Diversion (CDIV) service using IP Multimedia (IM) Core
      Network (CN) subsystem (IMS) supplementary service.  As part of CDIV,
      a SIP based event package is used for notifying users about
      diversions (re-directions or forwarding) of requests for
      communication sessions targetting the user.  This document defines
      the SIP event package to support subscription and notification of
      diversions.  The proposed event package is applicable to the CDIV
      supplementary service in IMS and may not be applicable to the general
      internet.

  "Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET)", Fred Templin, 2013-05-03,
  <draft-templin-intarea-vet-40.txt>

      Enterprise networks connect hosts and routers over various link
      types, and often also connect to the global Internet either directly
      or via a provider network.  Enterprise network nodes require a means
      to automatically provision addresses/prefixes and support
      internetworking operation in a wide variety of use cases including
      Small Office / Home Office (SOHO) networks, Mobile Ad hoc Networks
      (MANETs), ISP networks, multi-organizational corporate networks and
      the interdomain core of the global Internet itself.  This document
      specifies a Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET) abstraction for
      autoconfiguration and operation of nodes in dynamic enterprise
      networks.

      functionality can be used to provide seamless mobility to a mobile
      node.  The LISP Mobile Node design described in this document uses
      standard LISP functionality to provide scalable mobility for LISP
      mobile nodes.

  "Reverse DNS in IPv6 for Internet Service Providers", Lee Howard,
  2013-03-26, <draft-howard-isp-ip6rdns-06.txt>

      In IPv4, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) commonly provide IN-
      ADDR.ARPA. information for their customers by prepopulating the zone
      with one PTR record for every available address.  This practice does
      not scale in IPv6.  This document analyzes different approaches for
      ISPs to manage the ip6.arpa zone for IPv6 address space assigned to
      many customers.

  "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) P-Private-Network-Indication
  Private-Header (P-Header)", Hans van Elburg, Keith Drage, Mayumi Ohsugi,
  Shida Schubert, Kenjiro Arai, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-vanelburg-dispatch-private-network-ind-02.txt>

      This document specifies the SIP P-Private-Network-Indication P-header
      used by the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).  The use of
      this private network indication extension is only applicable inside
      an administrative domain with previously agreed-upon policies for
      generation, transport and usage of such information.  A private
      network indication allows nodes in such a domain to treat private
      network traffic according to a different set of rules than the set
      applicable to public network traffic.  The indication also
      distinguishes traffic from one private network from another private
      network.

  "The atypes media feature tag for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)",
  Mohamed Boucadair, Andrew Allen, 2013-06-11,
  <draft-boucadair-dispatch-ipv6-atypes-01.txt>

      This specification defines a new media feature tag called atypes.
      This new media feature tag indicates the IP address type capabilities
      of the UA (User Agent) and can aid the routing process and ease the
      invocation of required functions when heterogeneous (i.e., IPv4 and
      IPv6) parties are involved in a given SIP session.
      
      This specification solves a problem raised in 3GPP TS 24.229
      [TS.24229].

  "PIM-SM DR Priority Auto-Adjustment", Xiaohu Xu, Temple Steps, Rajiv

      This document defines some mechanisms for automatically adjusting the
      Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Designed Router (DR) priority
      according to the status of the tracked interface. This approach can
      be used to realize DR auto-switchover in case the DR loses the route
      to multicast source or Rendezvous Point (RP).

  "dIVI: Dual-Stateless IPv4/IPv6 Translation", Congxiao Bao, Xing Li, Yu
  Zhai, Wentao Shang, 2013-06-18, <draft-xli-behave-divi-05.txt>

      This document presents the concepts and the implementations of
      address-sharing dual-stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation (dIVI).
      
      The dIVI is an extension of 1:1 stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation with
      features of IPv4 address sharing and dual translation.  The major
      benefits of those extensions are using public IPv4 addresses more
      effectively and removing the requirements of DNS64 and ALG, without
      loosing the stateless, end-to-end address transparency and
      bidirectional-initiated communications.

  "DNS46 for the IPv4/IPv6 Stateless Translator", Xing Li, Congxiao Bao,
  2013-07-11, <draft-xli-behave-dns46-for-stateless-04.txt>

      The stateless translator can support IPv6-initiated communications as
      well as IPv4-initiated communications for IPv6 hosts using IPv4-
      translatable addresses.  DNS support for the IPv6-initiated
      communication is defined in the DNS64 specification.  This document
      defines the DNS46 function for the stateless translator.

  "Mesh Structured Hierarchical Networking and IPv6", Shyam Bandyopadhyay,
  2013-05-19, <draft-shyam-mshn-ipv6-15.txt>

      This document tries to address an approach for reorganization of
      entire network in a large address space. It describes how a three-
      tier mesh structured hierarchy can be established based on
      fragmenting the entire space into some regions and sub regions inside
      each of them. It addresses issues which could be relevant to this
      architecture in the context of IPv6. This document also tries to come
      out with an approach how IP switch based network can perform as good
      as ATM network for the processing of real time traffic.

  "JSON Schema: core definitions and terminology", Francis Galiegue, Kris
  Zyp, Gary Court, 2013-01-31, <draft-zyp-json-schema-04.txt>

      JSON Schema defines the media type "application/schema+json", a JSON
      based format for defining the structure of JSON data.  JSON Schema
      provides a contract for what JSON data is required for a given
      application and how to interact with it.  JSON Schema is intended to
      define validation, documentation, hyperlink navigation, and
      interaction control of JSON data.

      specific elements of rxgk.

  "Stateless Automatic IPv4 over IPv6 Encapsulation / Decapsulation
  Technology: Global SA46T Address Format", Naoki Matsuhira, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-matsuhira-sa46t-gaddr-07.txt>

      This document proposes Stateless Automatic IPv4 over IPv6
      Encapsulation / Decapsulation Technology (SA46T) Global Address
      Format.
      
      SA46T can apply to organization's network individually, but if
      coordination between the organizations made, the total number of
      times of encapsulations and decapusulations can be reduced.  That
      coordination is achieved by using same SA46T address format, that is
      Global address.  This document proposes SA46T Global address format.
      
      SA46T is a gateway technology, not protocol.  But SA46T Global
      Address needs IANA assignment, so this document should be categorized
      standard track or experimental.

  "Xon/Xoff State Control for Telnet Com Port Control Option", Grant
  Edwards, 2010-03-23,
  <draft-edwards-telnet-xon-xoff-state-control-00.txt,.pdf>

      This document defines new values for use with the telnet com port
      control option's SET-CONTROL sub-command defined in RFC2217.  These
      new values provide a mechanism for the telnet client to control and
      query the outbound Xon/Xoff flow control state of the telnet server's
      physical serial port.  This capability is exposed in the serial port
      API on some operating systems and is needed by telnet clients that
      implement a port-redirector service which provides applications local
      to the redirector/telnet-client with transparent access to the remote
      serial port on the telnet server.

  "Linear Protection Switching in MPLS-TP", Huub van Helvoort, Jeong-dong
  Ryoo, Zhang Haiyan, Feng Huang, Han Li, Alessandro D'Alessandro,

  "Overlay Transport Virtualization", Hasmit Grover, Dhananjaya Rao, Dino
  Farinacci, Victor Moreno, 2013-02-23, <draft-hasmit-otv-04.txt>

      In today's networking environment most enterprise networks span
      multiple physical sites.  Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV)
      provides a scalable solution for L2/L3 connectivity across different
      sites using the currently deployed service provider and enterprise
      networks.  It is a very cost-effective and simple solution requiring
      deployment of a one or more OTV functional device at each of the
      enterprise sites.  This solution is agnostic to the technology used
      in the service provider network and connectivity between the
      enterprise and the service provider network.  This document provides
      an overview of this technology.

  "Advanced Groupware Access Protocol", Iulian Radu, 2013-05-08,
  <draft-iulian-advanced-groupware-access-protocol-07.txt>

      The Advanced Groupware Access Protocol, (AGAP) allows a client to
      access and store electronic mail messages, contacts, events, files,
      and configurations on a server.  The electronic mail messages can be
      grouped in folders.  AGAP also provides the capability for an offline
      client to resynchronize with the server.
      
      AGAP does not specify a means of posting electronic mail messages;
      this function is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as SMTP
      [RFC2821] .  It also does not specify a means for exchanging messages
      with contacts that are reported as being online; this function is
      handled by an instant messaging protocol such as XMPP [RFC3921] .
      
      AGAP includes the following operations for electronic mail messages:
      creating, deleting, renaming, moving and coping mail folders;
      checking for new messages; permanently removing messages; moving and
      coping messages between folders; fetching information about a
      message; setting and clearing tags for messages; searching in
      messages; retrieving only a part of a message; marking messages as
      SPAM; deleting attachments from a message.
      
      AGAP includes the following operations to manipulate the contacts:
      creating, deleting, moving, coping, tagging, and searching contacts;
      checking if a contact is online; fetching information about a
      contact.
      
      AGAP includes the following operations related to the use of the
      events: creating, deleting, moving, coping and tagging events in
      calendar; fetching events details; searching for events.
      
      All entries are read and written in format XML encoded UTF-8
      [RFC3629] and each entry is identified by a unique alphanumeric
      identifier.
      
      AGAP is designed to support access only to a single server per
      connection.  It is also designed to balance the volume of text
      exchanged between the server and clients and its readability by
      humans for debugging.

  "Benchmarking Power usage of networking devices", Vishwas Manral, Puneet
  Sharma, Sujata Banerjee, Yang Ping, 2013-03-12,
  <draft-manral-bmwg-power-usage-04.txt>

      With the rapid growth of networks around the globe there is an ever
      increasing need to improve the energy efficiency of network devices.
      Operators are begining to seek more information of power consumption
      in the network, have no standard mechanism to measure, report and
      compare power usage of different networking equipment under different
      network configuration and conditions.
      
      This document provides suggestions for measuring power usage of live
      networks under different traffic loads and various switch router
      configuration settings.  It provides a benchmarking suite which can
      be employed for any networking device .

  "Implications of Full-Duplex HTTP", Wenbo Zhu, Mike Jennings,
  2013-05-15, <draft-zhu-http-fullduplex-07.txt>

      Full-duplex HTTP follows the basic HTTP request-response semantics
      but also allows the server to send response body to the client at the
      same time when the client is transmitting request body to the server.
      Requirements for full-duplex HTTP are under-specified in the existing
      HTTP specification [RFC2616], and this memo intends to clarify the
      requirements of full-duplex HTTP on top of the basic HTTP protocol
      semantics.

  "Protocol for Stage Illumination", Marcus Ertl, 2013-05-24,

      This memo describes a protocol that builds upon UDP/IP to transport
      illumination and control data for stage, architectural and other
      illumination requirements.
      
      It may be understood as a spiritual successor of the traditional DMX
      (Digital MultipleX) specification series, removing it's limitations
      and adding flexibility and usability enhancements like auto-discovery
      and metadata, among other useful features.

      the proposals are not all fleshed out at this point in time.

  "Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Scheme for Digital Video Broadcasting
  (DVB) Programme Resources", Mo McRoberts, Alexander Adolf, 2013-03-26,
  <draft-mcroberts-uri-dvb-10.txt>

      Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes for broadcasting programme
      resources transmitted over MPEG-2 Transport Streams [MPEG-Systems]
      have been devised in their process of creating standards by the
      Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB), the Association of Radio
      Industries and Businesses in Japan (ARIB) and the OpenCable
      Application Platform (OCAP) to acquire current and future scheduled
      publications of broadcast media content from multimedia applications
      such as HTTP, MHP [DVB-MHP], OCAP [OCAP1.0] or other XML based
      metadata.
      
      These URI are used to locate the actual digital TV, Radio or other
      multimedia broadcast programme services (i.e., channels or events)
      and also the audio-visual components related to that programme, for
      example an HTTP-based programme guide on the Web or other XML-based
      electronic programme guides in digital broadcast receivers.
      
      This document defines the "dvb" URI scheme for the benefit of the
      Internet community, given its definition as part of the Digital Video
      Broadcasting (DVB) suite of ETSI standards.

  "Load Sharing for the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)", Paul
  Amer, Martin Becke, Thomas Dreibholz, Nasif Ekiz, Jana, Preethi
  Natarajan, Randall Stewart, Michael Tuexen, 2013-03-26,
  <draft-tuexen-tsvwg-sctp-multipath-06.txt>

      The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) supports multi-homing
      for providing network fault tolerance.  However, mainly one path is
      used for data transmission.  Only timer-based retransmissions are
      carried over other paths as well.
      
      This document describes how multiple paths can be used simultaneously
      for transmitting user messages.

  "ISIS Protocol Extensions for Boundary Node Discovery (BND)", Dhruv
  Dhody, Udayasree Palle, 2013-02-21,
  <draft-dhody-pce-bn-discovery-isis-06.txt>

      The Path Computation Element (PCE) may be used for computing multi-
      domain (Area or AS) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
      Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switch Path
      (LSP).
      
      In this circumstance, it is highly desirable to be able to
      dynamically and automatically discover a set of Boundary Nodes (BN)

  "Registry Data Escrow Specification", Francisco Arias, Gustavo Lozano,
  Shoji Noguchi, 2013-04-04,
  <draft-arias-noguchi-registry-data-escrow-06.txt>

      This document specifies the format and contents of data escrow
      deposits targeted primarily for domain name registries.  However, the
      specification was designed to be independent of the underlying
      objects that are being escrowed, therefore it could be used for
      purposes other than domain name registries.

  "Port Management To Reduce Logging In Large-Scale NATs", Tina Tsou,
  Weibo Li, Tom Taylor, Jing Huang, 2013-07-02,
  <draft-tsou-behave-natx4-log-reduction-04.txt>

      Various IPv6 transition strategies require the introduction of large-
      scale NATs (e.g. AFTR, NAT64) to share the limited supply of IPv4
      addresses available in the network until transition is complete.
      There has recently been debate over how to manage the sharing of
      ports between different subscribers sharing the same IPv4 address.
      One factor in the discussion is the operational requirement to log
      the assignment of transport addresses to subscribers.  It has been
      argued that dynamic assignment of individual ports between
      subscribers requires the generation of an excessive volume of logs.
      This document suggests a way to achieve dynamic port sharing while
      keeping log volumes low.

  "Media Resource Broker (MRB) Location Function (MLF)", Chris Boulton,
  John Dally, 2013-07-30,
  <draft-boulton-mediactrl-mrb-location-function-05.txt>

      The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF has produced a complete
      architecture for controlling media server resources in Internet
      Protocol (IP) based networks.  An important function in the MediaCtrl
      architecture is the Media Resource Broker entity which monitors and
      allocates media resources to requesting applications.  This document
      introduces a Media Resource Broker (MRB) Location Function (MLF)
      which works in partnership with MRB's in large deployments providing
      a light weight scaling and failover mechanism.

  "Hosts with Any Network Connectivity Using "Bump-in-the-API"(BIA)", Ala
  Hamarsheh, 2011-01-19, <draft-hamarsheh-behave-biav2-05.txt>

      This document specifies a mechanism for hosts with any network
      connectivity (IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or dual IPv4/IPv6 
      connectivity) to run applications of any capability 
      (IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or dual IPv4/IPv6) without any 
      modification to those applications. It is a generalisation 
      of a previous experimental protocol called "Bump-in-the-API"
      (BIA) [RFC3338]. New mechanism of BIA allows a changeover between
      the application layer and the IP communication layers from IPv4 
      to IPv6 and vice versa or IPv6 to IPv4 and vice versa, without 
      requiring those applications to be converted in addressing 
      capabilities, effectively shielding the application layer from
      IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity. This is considered by the authors to
      be one of the essential conditions for the transition to IPv6
      in the Internet to be successful.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Authentication Using GSM 2G
  Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA)", Lionel Morand, 2013-01-21,
  <draft-morand-http-digest-2g-aka-03.txt>

      This memo specifies a one-time password generation mechanism for
      Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest access authentication based
      on Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) authentication and
      key generation functions A3 and A8, also known as GSM AKA or 2G AKA.
      The HTTP Authentication Framework includes two authentication
      schemes: Basic and Digest.  Both schemes employ a shared secret based
      mechanism for access authentication.  The GSM AKA mechanism performs
      user authentication and session key distribution in GSM and Universal
      Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks.  GSM AKA is a
      challenge-response based mechanism that uses symmetric cryptography.

  Chris Donley, Lee Howard, Victor Kuarsingh, John Berg, University
  Colorado, 2013-04-05, <draft-donley-nat444-impacts-06.txt>

      NAT444 is an IPv4 extension technology being considered by Service
      Providers to continue offering IPv4 service to customers while
      transitioning to IPv6.  This technology adds an extra Carrier-Grade
      NAT ("CGN") in the Service Provider network, often resulting in two
      NATs.  CableLabs, Time Warner Cable, and Rogers Communications
      independently tested the impacts of NAT444 on many popular Internet
      services using a variety of test scenarios, network topologies, and
      vendor equipment.  This document identifies areas where adding a
      second layer of NAT disrupts the communication channel for common
      Internet applications.  This document was updated to also include
      Dual-Stack Lite impacts.

  "HTTP framework for time-based access to resource states -- Memento",
  Herbert Van de Sompel, Michael Nelson, Robert Sanderson, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-vandesompel-memento-08.txt>

      The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web. It
      facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given
      resource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps.  Datetime
      negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the
      given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime.  TimeMaps
      are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior
      states of the given resource.  The framework also facilitates
      recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of
      another resource.

  "Applicability of Proxy Mobile IPv6 Protocol for WLAN Access Networks",
  Sri Gundavelli, 2013-04-23,
  <draft-gundavelli-netext-pmipv6-wlan-applicability-05.txt>

      Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility management protocol.
      The protocol is designed for providing mobility management support to
      a mobile node, without requiring its participation in any IP mobility
      related signaling.  The base protocol is defined in an access
      technology independent manner, it identifies the general requirements
      from the link-layer for supporting the protocol operation.  However,
      it does not provide any specific details on how it can be supported
      on a specific access technology.  This specification identifies the
      key considerations for supporting Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol on the
      widely deployed wireless LAN access architectures, based on IEEE
      802.11 standards.  It explores the current dominant wireless LAN
      deployment models and provides the needed interworking details.

  "Mobile Ad-hoc On-Demand Data Delivery Protocol (MAODDP)", Humayun
  Bakht, 2011-07-28, <draft-bakht-maoddp-01.txt>

      Routing in mobile ad-hoc network is achieved through the mutual
      cooperation of mobile devices that form routes in between two mobile
      nodes.It is one of the challenging issues in mobile ad-hoc network [1].
      The current protocols for an ad-hoc network can generally be categorized
      into two groups i.e. pro-active and re-active[15,16,17,18]. 
      Pro-active
      protocols by continuously evaluating the known and attempting 
      to
      discover new routes. 
      These protocols try to maintain the most up-to-
      date view of the 
      network[2]. This allows them to efficiently forward
      packets as the route 
      is known in advanced [14]. In contrast reactive
      protocols determine the 
      route only when require [3, 5, 6].
      Mobile Ad-
      hoc On Demand Data Delivery protocol (MAODDP) establishes 
      route on
      demand and delivers the data at the same time one after the 
      other
      [22].MAODDP support both unicast and multicast routing. 
      It is designed
      to minimize reaction to topological changes. 
      In order to ensure the
      freshness of route MAODDP uses combination 
      of sequence numbers and
      broadcast ID. MAODDP is loop-free,
      self-starting protocol whic can
      scales to different size of networks. 
      MAODDP offers quick adaptation to
      the dynamic link 
      conditions and determines routes to the destinations
      on demand.

  "Commentary on the Design of the Authenticated-Enveloped-Data Content
  Type", Jim Schaad, 2011-04-06, <draft-schaad-smime-aed-rant-02.txt>

      The Authenticated-Enveloped-Data Content Type allows for the use of
      Authenticated-Enveloped modes with block cipher algorithms.  At the
      time of the original design there was discussion about the relative
      location of the authenticated attributes and the encrypted content in
      the ASN.1 structure.  With the benefits of implementation experience
      I revisit the discussion made at the time and re-evaluate the
      decision made.

  Meng Yu, 2013-07-02, <draft-khasnabish-cloud-reference-framework-05.txt>

      This document presents a cloud reference framework that intends to
      provide a basis for designing interoperable cloud services and their
      integration into existing open Internet and enterprise IT
      infrastructures.
      
      In general, a cloud-based system utilizes virtualized computing /
      communications / storage resources and applications, and allows their
      combined provisioning as complex infrastructure services.  In the
      emerging cloud-based virtualized infrastructures and services are
      provisioned on on-demand basis, and configured for specific customer
      needs or tasks.
      
      The reference framework is based on the survey of the SDOs and WGs
      that are focusing on cloud-based systems and services (Cloud SDO,
      I-D.Khasnabish-cloud-sdo-survey), on-going standardisation activities
      and other research and developments in the cloud computing technology
      area.  Both intra-cloud and inter-cloud reference frameworks are
      presented and the requirements to the general functional layers and
      components are discussed.

  "Encoding the graphemes of the SignWriting Script with the x-ISWA-2010",
  Stephen Slevinski, Valerie Sutton, 2011-01-03,
  <draft-slevinski-iswa-2010-00.txt>

      For concreteness, because the universal character set is not yet
      universal, because an undocumented and unlabeled coded character set
      hampers information interchange, a 12-bit coded character set has
      been created that encodes the graphemes of the SignWriting script as
      described in the open standard of the International SignWriting
      Alphabet 2010.  The x-ISWA-2010 coded character set is defined with
      hexadecimal characters and described with Unicode characters, either
      proposed characters on plane 1 or interchange characters on plane 15.
      
      This memo defines a standard coded character set for the Internet
      community.  It is published for reference, examination,
      implementation, and evaluation.  Distribution of this memo is
      unlimited.

  Boucadair, Reinaldo Penno, 2013-05-16,
  <draft-boucadair-pcp-failure-06.txt>

      This document identifies and analyzes several PCP failure scenarios.
      Identifying these failure scenarios is useful to assess the
      efficiency of the protocol and also to decide whether new PCP
      extensions are needed.

  "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO package for Private Wire",
  Richard Beauchamp, Finlay Fraser, Chris Boulton, 2013-07-30,
  <draft-beauchamp-private-wire-07.txt>

      Application level data exchanged using the SIP INFO method are
      supported and documented in specifications known as 'INFO Packages'.
      This document defines functionality associated with Session
      Initiation Protocol (SIP) Private Wire functionality and creates an
      'INFO Package' for carrying such application level data.

  "A Simple Method for Segmenting Multicast Tunnels for Multicast VPNs",
  Maria Napierala, Eric Rosen, 2013-04-10,
  <draft-rosen-l3vpn-mvpn-segments-05.txt>

      To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) Service, Service Providers (SPs) need
      to instantiate multicast tunnels (known as "P-tunnels") that enable
      the Provider Edge (PE) routers of a given VPN to transmit multicast
      packets to each other.  Some SPs organize their networks in a
      hierarchical manner, with the PE routers in "edge areas", and the
      edge areas connected to each other via a "core area". A P-tunnel that
      connects PE routers in different edge areas can be thought of as
      having three segments: a segment through one edge area, a segment
      through the core area, and a segment through the second edge area.
      It is desirable to preserve the independence of the core area by
      allowing it to use a different tunneling technology than that used in
      the edge areas.  However, it is not desirable for the core area
      Border Routers (BRs) to participate in the MVPN-specific signaling,
      or even to have any knowledge of which MVPNs are in the edge areas
      that attach to it.  This document specifies a simple method for
      segmenting MVPN P-tunnels at the BRs, subject to these constraints.

  "Client Subnet in DNS Requests", Carlo Contavalli, Wilmer van der Gaast,
  Sean Leach, Edward Lewis, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-vandergaast-edns-client-subnet-02.txt>

      This draft defines an EDNS0 extension to carry information about the
      network that originated a DNS query, and the network for which the
      subsequent reply can be cached.

  "A Uniform Resource Name Namespace for the Device Identity and the
  Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID)", Roozbeh Atarius, 2013-02-21,
  <draft-atarius-dispatch-meid-urn-03.txt>

      The specification fulfills the requirement from Third Generation
      Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) by registering a Uniform Resource Name
      (URN) namespace for the device identity and a sub namespace for the
      Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID).  The structure of the MEID is 15
      hexadecimal encoded digits long and is defined in 3GPP2 to uniquely
      identify a mobile equipment.

  "Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar", Mike Douglass, 2013-06-05,
  <draft-douglass-calendar-extension-03.txt,.pdf>

      This specification introduces a number of new iCalendar properties
      which are of particular use for event publishers and in social
      networking.

  "PCEP Extension for WSON Routing and Wavelength Assignment", Young Lee,
  Ramon Casellas, 2013-02-06, <draft-lee-pce-wson-rwa-ext-05.txt>

      This draft provides the Path Computation Element communication
      Protocol (PCEP) extensions for the support of Routing and Wavelength
      Assignment (RWA) in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON).
      Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a routing and wavelength
      assignment (RWA) process.  From a path computation perspective,
      wavelength assignment is the process of determining which wavelength
      can be used on each hop of a path and forms an additional routing
      constraint to optical light path computation.

  "Recommendations for Efficient Implementation of RPL", Omprakash
  Gnawali, P Levis, 2013-03-14,
  <draft-gnawali-roll-rpl-recommendations-05.txt>

      RPL is a flexible routing protocol applicable to a wide range of Low
      Power and Lossy Networks.  To enable this wide applicability, RPL
      provides many configuration options and gives implementers choices on
      how to implement various components of RPL.  Drawing on our
      experiences, we distill the design choices and configuration
      parameters that lead to efficient RPL implementations and operations.

  "Multipath RTP (MPRTP)", Varun Singh, Teemu Karkkainen, Joerg Ott, Saba
  Ahsan, Lars Eggert, 2013-07-14, <draft-singh-avtcore-mprtp-07.txt>

      The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to deliver real-time
      content and, along with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), forms the
      control channel between the sender and receiver.  However, RTP and
      RTCP assume a single delivery path between the sender and receiver
      and make decisions based on the measured characteristics of this
      single path.  Increasingly, endpoints are becoming multi-homed, which
      means that they are connected via multiple Internet paths.  Network
      utilization can be improved when endpoints use multiple parallel
      paths for communication.  The resulting increase in reliability and
      throughput can also enhance the user experience.  This document
      extends the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) so that a single
      session can take advantage of the availability of multiple paths
      between two endpoints.

  "MPLS-TP Ring Protection Switching (MRPS)", Huub van Helvoort,
  Jeong-dong Ryoo, 2013-04-13,
  <draft-helvoort-mpls-tp-ring-protection-switching-04.txt>

      This document describes a mechanism to address the requirements for
      protection of the Multi-Protocol Label Switching Transport Profile
      (MPLS-TP) Label Switched Paths (LSP) in a ring topology.  The
      mechanism defined herein is designed to support point-to-point as
      well as point-to-multipoint LSPs.
      
      The MPLS-TP section layer OAM is used to monitor the connectivity
      between each two adjacent nodes using the mechanisms defined in the
      [RFC6371].
      
      The Automatic Protection Switching (APS) protocol is used for
      coordination of protection switching actions between the ring nodes.

  "Diverse Path Implementation Report", Jeff Tantsura, Selma Yilmaz, Keyur
  Patel, Satish Mynam, Robert Raszuk, 2013-05-07,
  <draft-mynam-grow-diverse-path-impl-01.txt>

      This document provides an implementation report for Diverse Path as
      defined in RFC6774.  The editor did not verify the accuracy of the
      information provided by respondents or by any alternative means.  The
      respondents are experts with the implementations they reported on,
      and their responses are considered authoritative for the
      implementations for which their responses represent.

  "Guidelines for Adding Congestion Notification to Protocols that
  Encapsulate IP", Bob Briscoe, John Kaippallimalil, Patricia Thaler,
  2013-02-25, <draft-briscoe-tsvwg-ecn-encap-guidelines-02.txt>

      The purpose of this document is to guide the design of congestion
      notification in any lower layer or tunnelling protocol that
      encapsulates IP.  The aim is for explicit congestion signals to
      propagate consistently from lower layer protocols into IP.  Then the
      IP internetwork layer can act as a portability layer to carry
      congestion notification from non-IP-aware congested nodes up to the
      transport layer (L4).  Following these guidelines should assure
      interworking between new lower layer congestion notification
      mechanisms, whether specified by the IETF or other standards bodies.

  "DECADE Protocol", Richard Alimi, Akbar Rahman, Dirk Kutscher, Yang
  Yang, Haibin Song, Kostas Pentikousis, 2013-02-07,
  <draft-ietf-decade-arch-10.txt>

      Content Distribution Applications (e.g., P2P applications) are widely
      used on the Internet and make up a large portion of the traffic in
      many networks.  One technique to improve the network efficiency of
      these applications is to introduce storage capabilities within the
      networks; this is the capability provided by a DECADE (DECoupled
      Application Data Enroute) compatible system.  This document presents
      an architecture, discusses the underlying principles, and identifies
      key functionalities in the architecture for introducing a DECADE in-
      network storage system.  In addition, some examples are given to
      illustrate these concepts.

  "Management Information Base for MPLS LDP Multi Topology", Chen Li,
  Lianyuan Li, Lu Huang, Tao Chou, Quintin Zhao, Emily Chen, 2013-07-07,
  <draft-li-mpls-ldp-mt-mib-04.txt>

      This memo defines an portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
      In particular, it describes a MIB module for Multi-Topology Networks
      over Multi-protocol Label Switching(MPLS) Label Switching
      Routers(LSRs).

  "Applicability of Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
  User-Network Interface (UNI)", Fatai Zhang, Oscar de Dios, Adrian
  Farrel, Xian Zhang, Daniele Ceccarelli, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-uni-app-04.txt>

      Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) defines a set of
      protocols for the creation of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in various
      switching technologies. The GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) was
      developed in RFC4208 in order to be applied to an overlay network
      architectural model.
      
      This document examines a number of GMPLS UNI application scenarios.
      It shows how techniques developed after the GMPLS UNI can be applied
      to automate or enable critical processes for these applications. This
      document also suggests simple extensions that could be made to
      existing technologies to further enable the UNI and points out some
      unresolved issues.

  "Multipath TCP Support for Single-homed End-systems", Rolf Winter,
  Michael Faath, Andreas Ripke, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-wr-mptcp-single-homed-05.txt>

      Multipath TCP relies on the existence of multiple paths at the end-
      systems typically provided through different IP addresses obtained by
      different ISPs.  While this scenario is certainly becoming
      increasingly a reality (e.g.  mobile devices), currently most end-
      systems are single-homed (e.g.  desktop PCs in an enterprise). It
      seems also likely that a lot of network sites will insist on having
      all traffic pass a single network element (e.g.  for security
      reasons) before traffic is split across multiple paths.  This memo
      therefore describes mechanisms to make multiple paths available to
      multipath TCP-capable end-systems that are not available directly at
      the end-systems but somewhere within the network.

  "A packet based method for passive performance monitoring", Alessandro
  Capello, Mauro Cociglio, Luca Castaldelli, Alberto Bonda, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-tempia-opsawg-p3m-03.txt>

      This document describes a passive method to perform packet loss,
      delay and jitter measurements on live traffic.  Implementation and
      deployment details are also explained in order to clarify how the
      tools and features currently available on existing routing platforms
      can be used to implement the method.  This method has been invented
      and engineered in Telecom Italia and it's currently being used in
      Telecom Italia's network.

  "Flexible Multilevel TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of
  Links)", Radia Perlman, Donald Eastlake, Anoop Ghanwani, ZTE
  Corporation, 2013-07-04, <draft-perlman-trill-rbridge-multilevel-06.txt>

      Extending TRILL to multiple levels has one challenge that is not
      addressed by the already-existing capability of IS-IS to have
      multiple levels. The issue is with RBridge nicknames. There have been
      two proposed approaches.  One approach, which we refer to as the
      "unique nickname" approach, gives unique nicknames to all the
      RBridges in the multilevel campus, either by having the
      level-1/level-2 border RBridges advertise which nicknames are not
      available for assignment in the area, or by partitioning the 16-bit
      nickname into an "area" field and a "nickname inside the area" field.
      The other approach, which we refer to as the "aggregated nickname"
      approach, involves assigning nicknames to the areas, and allowing
      nicknames to be reused in different areas, by having the border
      RBridges rewrite the nickname fields when entering or leaving an
      area. Each of those approaches has advantages and disadvantages. The
      design in this document allows a choice of approach in each area,
      allowing the simplicity of the unique nickname approach in
      installations in which there is no danger of running out of
      nicknames, and allowing nickname rewriting to be phased into larger
      installations on a per-area basis.

  "The FNV Non-Cryptographic Hash Algorithm", Glenn Fowler, Landon Noll,
  Kiem-Phong Vo, Donald Eastlake, 2013-04-06, <draft-eastlake-fnv-05.txt>

      FNV (Fowler/Noll/Vo) is a fast, non-cryptographic hash algorithm with
      good dispersion. The purpose of this document is to make information
      on FNV and open source code performing FNV conveniently available to
      the Internet community.

  "Reusing the IPv4 Identification Field in Atomic Packets", Bob Briscoe,
  2013-07-15, <draft-briscoe-intarea-ipv4-id-reuse-03.txt>

      This specification takes a new approach to extensibility that is both
      principled and a hack.  It builds on recent moves to formalise the
      increasingly common practice where fragmentation in IPv4 more closely
      matches that of IPv6.  The large majority of IPv4 packets are now
      'atomic', meaning indivisible.  In such packets, the 16 bits of the
      IPv4 Identification (IPv4 ID) field are redundant and could be freed
      up for the Internet community to put to other uses, at least within
      the constraints imposed by their original use for reassembly.  This
      specification defines the process for redefining the semantics of
      these bits.  It uses the previously reserved control flag in the IPv4
      header to indicate that these 16 bits have new semantics.  Great care
      is taken throughout to ease incremental deployment, even in the
      presence of middleboxes that incorrectly discard or normalise packets
      that have the reserved control flag set.

  "6LoWPAN Roadmap and Implementation Guide", Carsten Bormann, 2013-04-13,
  <draft-bormann-6lowpan-roadmap-04.txt>

      6LoWPAN is defined in RFC 4944 in conjunction with a number of
      specifications that are currently nearing completion.  The entirety
      of these specifications may be hard to understand, pose specific
      implementation problems, or be simply inconsistent.
      
      The present guide aims to provide a roadmap to these documents as
      well as provide specific advice how to use these specifications in
      combination.  In certain cases, it may provide clarifications or even
      corrections to the specifications referenced.
      
      This guide is intended as a continued work-in-progress, i.e.  a long-
      lived Internet-Draft, to be updated whenever new information becomes
      available and new consensus on how to handle issues is formed.
      Similar to the ROHC implementation guide, RFC 4815, it might be
      published as an RFC at some future time later in the maintenance
      curve of the specifications.
      
      This document does not describe a new protocol or attempt to set a
      new standard of any kind - it mostly describes good practice in using
      the existing specifications, but it may also document emerging
      consensus where a correction needs to be made.

  "Port Control Protocol (PCP) Extension for Port Set Allocation", Qiong
  Sun, Mohamed Boucadair, Senthil Sivakumar, Cathy Zhou, Tina Tsou, Simon
  Perreault, 2013-02-25, <draft-tsou-pcp-natcoord-10.txt>

      This document defines an extension to PCP allowing clients to
      manipulate sets of ports as a whole.  This is accomplished by a new
      MAP option: PORT_SET.

  "A Forward-Search P2P TE LSP Inter-Domain Path Computation", Huaimo
  Chen, Dhruv Dhody, 2013-04-29,
  <draft-chen-pce-forward-search-p2p-path-computation-06.txt>

      This document presents a forward search procedure for computing paths
      for Point-to-Point (P2P) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched
      Paths (LSPs) crossing a number of domains using multiple Path
      Computation Elements (PCEs).  In addition, extensions to the Path
      Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) for supporting the
      forward search procedure are described.

  "Changing DNS Operators for DNSSEC signed Zones", Peter Koch, Marcos
  Sanz, Antoin Verschuren, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-koch-dnsop-dnssec-operator-change-05.txt>

      Changing the DNS delegation for a DNS zone is quite involved if done
      by the books, but most often handled pragmatically in today's
      operational practice at the top level with registries and registrars.
      This document describes a delegation change procedure that maintains
      consistency and validation under DNSSEC.

  "Adaptive VLAN Assignment for Data Center RBridges", Mingui Zhang,
  Dacheng Zhang, 2013-04-23, <draft-zhang-trill-vlan-assign-05.txt>

      If RBridges are casually assigned as Appointed Forwarders for VLANs
      without considering the number of MAC addresses and traffic load of
      these VLANs, it may overload some of the RBridges while leave other
      RBridges lightly loaded, which reduces the scalability of a RBridge
      network and undermines its performance.
      
      A new mechanism is designed in this document to support the adaptive
      VLAN assignment (or Appointed Forwarder selection) based on the
      forwarders' reporting of their usage of MAC tables and available
      bandwidth.

  "Security Considerations in the IP-based Internet of Things", Oscar
  Garcia-Morchon, Sye Keoh, Sandeep Kumar, Rene Hummen, Rene Struik,
  2013-03-11, <draft-garcia-core-security-05.txt>

      A direct interpretation of the Internet of Things concept refers to
      the usage of standard Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing
      or thing-to-thing communication.  Although the security needs are
      well-recognized, it is still not fully clear how existing IP-based
      security protocols can be applied to this new setting.  This
      Internet-Draft first provides an overview of security architecture,
      its deployment model and general security needs in the context of the
      lifecycle of a thing.  Then, it presents challenges and requirements
      for the successful roll-out of new applications and usage of standard
      IP-based security protocols when applied to get a functional Internet
      of Things.

  "Data Center Mobility based on E-VPN, BGP/MPLS IP VPN, IP Routing and
  NHRP", Rahul Aggarwal, Yakov Rekhter, Wim Henderickx, Ravi Shekhar,
  Luyuan Fang, Ali Sajassi, 2013-06-10,
  <draft-raggarwa-data-center-mobility-05.txt>

      This document describes a set of network-based solutions for seamless
      Virtual Machine mobility in the data center. These solutions provide
      a toolkit which is based on IP routing, E-VPNs, BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, and
      NHRP.

  "A LoST extension to support return of complete and similar location
  info", Roger Marshall, Jeff Martin, Brian Rosen, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-marshall-ecrit-similar-location-02.txt>

      This document introduces a new way to provide returned location
      information in LoST responses that is either of a completed or
      similar form to the original input civic location, based on whether a
      valid or invalid location is returned within the findServiceResponse
      message.  This document defines a new extension to the
      findServiceResponse message within the LoST protocol [RFC5222] that
      enables the LoST protocol to return a completed civic location
      element set for a valid response, and one or more suggested sets of
      civic location information for invalid LoST responses.  These two
      types of civic addresses are referred to as either "complete" or
      "similar" locations, and are included as compilation of ca type xml
      elements within the existing response message structure.

  "On demand IPv4 address provisioning in Dual-Stack PPP deployment
  scenarios", Karsten Fleischhauer, Olaf Bonness, 2013-03-12,
  <draft-fleischhauer-ipv4-addr-saving-04.txt>

      Today the Dual-Stack approach is the most straightforward and the
      most common way for introducing IPv6 into existing systems and
      networks.  However a typical drawback of implementing Dual-Stack is
      that each node will still require at least one IPv4 address.  Hence,
      solely deploying Dual-Stack does not provide a sufficient solution to
      the IPv4 address exhaustion problem.  Assuming a situation where most
      of the IP communication (e.g.  always-on, VoIP etc.)  can be provided
      via IPv6, the usage of public IPv4 addresses can significantly be
      reduced and the unused public IPv4 addresses can under certain
      circumstances be returned to the public IPv4 address pool of the
      service provider.  New Dual-Stack enabled services can be introduced
      without increasing the public IPv4 address demand, whereas IPv6 will
      be the preferred network layer protocol.  This document describes
      such a solution in a Dual-Stack PPP session network scenario and
      explains the protocol mechanisms which are used.

  "Route Flap Damping Deployment Status Survey", Shishio Tsuchiya, Seiichi
  Kawamura, Randy Bush, Cristel Pelsser, 2012-06-21,
  <draft-shishio-grow-isp-rfd-implement-survey-05.txt>

      BGP Route Flap Damping [RFC2439] is a mechanism that targets route
      stability.  It penalyzes routes that flap with the aim of reducing
      CPU load on the routers.
      
      But it has side-effects.  Thus, in 2006, RIPE recommended not to use
      Route Flap Damping (see [RIPE-378]).
      
      Now, some researchers propose to turn RFD, with less aggressive
      parameters, back on [draft-ymbk-rfd-usable].
      
      This document describes results of a survey conducted among service
      provider on their use of BGP Route Flap Damping.

  "A Forward-Search P2MP TE LSP Inter-Domain Path Computation", Huaimo
  Chen, Dhruv Dhody, 2013-04-29,
  <draft-chen-pce-forward-search-p2mp-path-05.txt>

      This document presents a forward search procedure for computing a
      path for a Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label
      Switched Path (LSP) crossing a number of domains through using
      multiple Path Computation Elements (PCEs).  In addition, extensions
      to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) for
      supporting the forward search procedure are described.

  Andras Csaszar, Gabor Envedi, Jeff Tantsura, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-lu-fn-transport-04.txt>

      This document specifies mechanisms for fast and light-weight
      dissemination of event notifications.  The purpose is to enable
      dataplane dissemination of Fast Notifications (FNs).  The draft
      discusses the design goals, the message container and options for
      delivering the notifications to all routers within a routing area.

  "Bundle Protocol MIB", Zack Sims, Hans Kruse, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-sims-dtnrg-bpmib-03.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
      objects for managing information about a Bundle Node - or simply a
      'Node' within the scope of this document.  More specifically, the
      managed objects for such a Node include: Node-specific information,
      registered Endpoint-Specific information, and generic CLA-Specific
      (Convergence Layer Adapter) information.

  "Deterministic Usage of DSA and ECDSA Digital Signature Algorithms",
  Thomas Pornin, 2013-05-30, <draft-pornin-deterministic-dsa-02.txt>

      This document defines a deterministic digital signature generation
      procedure.  Such signatures are compatible with standard DSA and
      ECDSA digital signatures, and can be processed with unmodified
      verifiers, which need not be aware of the procedure described
      therein.  Deterministic signatures retain the cryptographic security
      features associated with digital signatures, but can be more easily
      implemented in various environments since they do not need access to
      a source of high quality randomness.

  "IP protocol suite extensions to support CONET Information Centric
  Networking", Andrea Detti, Stefano Salsano, Nicola Blefari-Melazzi,
  2013-06-20, <draft-detti-conet-ip-option-05.txt>

      The Information Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm shifts the focus of
      networking from providing connections between hosts to efficiently
      providing content to the users.  The work on ICN has traditionally
      been performed looking at "clean-slate" solutions which aims to
      replace IP with a new paradigm.  On the other hand, in this memo we
      propose an "integration" approach to Information Centric Networking,
      i.e. we extend the IP protocol suite by defining a new IP Protocol
      type (CONET).  Then we propose two ways of carring ICN related
      information in IP packets, one uses a new IP Option (both for IPv4
      and IPv6), the other one only relies on the IP payload.  The ICN
      related information is used by network nodes and end nodes to support
      networking based on content rather than (or better in addition to)
      end-point addresses.

  "A Description of KCipher-2 Encryption Algorithm", Shinsaku Kiyomoto,
  Wook Shin, 2013-06-17, <draft-kiyomoto-kcipher2-09.txt>

      This document describes the KCipher-2 encryption algorithm. KCipher-2
      is a stream cipher with a 128-bit key and a 128-bit initialization
      vector. Since the algorithm for KCipher-2 was published in 2007,
      security and efficiency have been rigorously evaluated through
      academic and industrial studies. No security vulnerability has been
      found as of the time this document was written. KCipher-2 offers fast
      encryption and decryption by means of simple operations that enable
      efficient implementation. KCipher-2 has been used for industrial
      applications, especially for mobile health monitoring and diagnostic
      services in Japan.

  "Verification Involving PSTN Reachability: Requirements and Architecture
  Overview", Mary Barnes, Cullen Jennings, Jonathan Rosenberg, Marc
  Petit-Huguenin, 2013-02-25, <draft-jennings-vipr-overview-04.txt>

      The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has seen widespread deployment
      within individual domains, typically supporting voice and video
      communications.  Though it was designed from the outset to support
      inter-domain federation over the public Internet, such federation has
      not materialized.  The primary reasons for this are the complexities
      of inter-domain phone number routing and concerns over security.
      This document reviews this problem space, outlines requirements, and
      then describes a new model and technique for inter-domain federation
      with SIP involving the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN),
      called Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (VIPR).  VIPR
      addresses the problems that have prevented inter-domain federation
      over the Internet.  It provides fully distributed inter-domain
      routing for phone numbers, authorized mappings from phone numbers to
      domains, a new technique for automated SIP anti-spam, and privacy of
      number ownership, all while preserving the trapezoidal model of SIP.

  "A SAVI solution for WLAN", Jun Bi, Jianping Wu, You Wang, Tao Lin,
  2013-02-05, <draft-bi-savi-wlan-03.txt>

      This document describes a source address validation solution for WLAN
      enabling 802.11i or other security mechanisms. This mechanism snoops
      NDP and DHCP to bind IP address with MAC address, and relies on the
      security of MAC address guaranteed by 802.11i or other mechanisms to
      filter IP spoofing packets. It can work in the special situations
      described in the charter of SAVI workgroup, such as multiple MAC
      addresses on one interface. This document describes three different
      deployment scenarios, with solutions for migration of binding entries
      when hosts move from one access point to another.

  "Suite B Profile for Datagram Transport Layer Security / Secure
  Real-time Transport Protocol (DTLS-SRTP)", Michael Peck, Kevin Igoe,
  2013-06-21, <draft-peck-suiteb-dtls-srtp-03.txt>

      The United States government has published guidelines for "NSA Suite
      B Cryptography", which defines cryptographic algorithm policy for
      national security applications.  This document describes the use of
      Suite B cryptography with the Datagram Transport Layer Security
      (DTLS) protocol, the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP), and
      the Secure Real-Time Transport Control Protocol (SRTCP) to provide a
      robust architecture for securing real-time data.

  "Launch Phase Mapping for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)",
  James Gould, Wil Tan, Gavin Brown, 2013-05-17,
  <draft-tan-epp-launchphase-11.txt>

      This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
      extension mapping for the provisioning and management of domain name
      registrations and applications during the launch of a domain name
      registry.

  "Extensions to Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
  for Hierarchical Path Computation Elements (PCE)", Fatai Zhang, Quintin
  Zhao, Oscar de Dios, Ramon Casellas, Daniel King, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-zhang-pce-hierarchy-extensions-04.txt>

      The Hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE) architecture,
      defined in the companion framework document [RFC6805], provides a
      mechanism to allow the optimum sequence of domains to be selected,
      and the optimum end-to-end path to be derived through the use of a
      hierarchical relationship between domains.
      
      This document defines the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)
      extensions for the purpose of implementing Hierarchical PCE
      procedures which are described in the aforementioned document. These
      extensions are experimental and published for examination,
      discussion, implementation, and evaluation.

  "Standardised ECC Cipher Suites for TLS", Peter Gutmann, 2013-06-28,
  <draft-gutmann-tls-eccsuites-05.txt>

      This document describes a set of standard ECC cipher suites for TLS
      that simplify the complex selection procedure described in the
      existing ECC RFC, simplifying implementation and easing
      interoperability problems.

  "URI Fragment Identifiers for the text/csv Media Type", Michael
  Hausenblas, Erik Wilde, Jeni Tennison, 2013-07-02,
  <draft-hausenblas-csv-fragment-04.txt>

      This memo defines URI fragment identifiers for text/csv MIME
      entities.  These fragment identifiers make it possible to refer to
      parts of a text/csv MIME entity, identified by row, column, or cell.
      Fragment identification can use single items, or ranges.

  "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over DECT Ultra Low Energy", Peter
  Mariager, Jens Petersen, Zach Shelby, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-mariager-6lowpan-v6over-dect-ule-03.txt,.pdf>

      DECT Ultra Low Energy is a low power air interface technology that is
      defined by the DECT Forum and specified by ETSI.
      
      The DECT air interface technology has been used world-wide in
      communication devices for more than 15 years, primarily carrying
      voice for cordless telephony but has also been deployed for data
      centric services.
      
      The DECT Ultra Low Energy is a recent addition to the DECT interface
      primarily intended for low-bandwidth, low-power applications such as
      sensor devices, smart meters, home automation etc.  As the DECT Ultra
      Low Energy interface inherits many of the capabilities from DECT, it
      benefits from long range, interference free operation, world wide
      reserved frequency band, low silicon prices and maturity.  There is
      an added value in the ability to communicate with IPv6 over DECT ULE
      such as for Internet of Things applications.
      
      This document describes how IPv6 is transported over DECT ULE using
      6LoWPAN techniques.

  "IPv6 Multicast in a 6rd Deployment", Behcet Sarikaya, Tina Tsou, Hui
  Ji, Cathy Zhou, 2013-03-13,
  <draft-sarikaya-softwire-6rdmulticast-05.txt>

      This memo specifies 6rd's multicast component so that IPv6 hosts can
      receive multicast data from IPv6 servers.  In the 6rd encapsulation
      solution, multicast communication is completely integrated into the
      6rd tunnel.  In the 6rd translation solution, the protocol is based
      on proxying MLD at the 6rd Customer Edge router interworking the MLD
      messages to IGMP messages and sending them upstream through a network
      which supports IPv4 multicast.  The 6rd Border Relay is a multicast
      router and interworks the IGMP to MLD for onward propasgation toward
      the IPv6 multicast source.  IPv6 Multicast data received at 6rd
      Border Relay is translated into IPv4 multicast data and and delivered
      through the IPv4 multicast tree downstream to the 6rd Customer Edge.
      The latter translates it back to IPv6 multicast data then delivers it
      to the hosts.

  "RADIUS Extensions for Port Set Configuration and Reporting", Dean
  Cheng, Jouni Korhonen, Mohamed Boucadair, Senthil Sivakumar, 2013-05-21,
  <draft-cheng-behave-cgn-cfg-radius-ext-05.txt>

      This document defines new RADIUS attributes that can be used by a
      device implementing port ranges to communicate with a RADIUS server
      to configure and/or report TCP/UDP port sets and ICMP identifiers
      mapping behavior for specific hosts.  This mechanism can be used in
      various deployment scenarios such as CGN, NAT64, Provider WiFi
      Gateway, etc.
      
      This document does not make any assumption about the deployment
      context.

  "A Taxonomy on Private Use Fields in Protocols", Chris Lonvick,
  2013-03-23, <draft-lonvick-private-tax-07.txt>

      This document attempts to provide some clarification for the way that
      private use fields have been used in protocols developed in the IETF.
      It is strictly a taxonomy of what has been published and offers a
      minimal amount of advice about how to design or use private use
      options.

  "Multi-Segment Pseudowire Signaling with Availability Information", Hao
  Long, Min Ye, 2013-02-18, <draft-long-pwe3-ms-pw-availability-01.txt>

      This document describes a signaling mechanism for setting up a
      multi-segment pseudowire between different domains in case that at
      least one domain has the feature that bandwidth capacity is variable
      for different availability values. The signaling mechanism is an
      extension on the multi-segment pseudowire signaling [DYN-MS-PW].

  "HTTP Origin and Hop Hints", Mark Nottingham, 2013-02-11,
  <draft-nottingham-http-browser-hints-05.txt>

      Over time, HTTP clients -- especially Web browsers -- have adapted
      how they use the protocol based upon common server configurations and
      behaviours.  While this is necessary in the common case, it can be
      detrimental for performance and interoperability.
      
      This document establishes a mechanism whereby both origin servers and
      intermediaries can make hints available to clients about their
      preferences and capabilities, without imposing undue overhead on
      their interactions or requiring support for them.
      
      This is intended to allow clients to safely optimise connections to
      servers.

  "Inter-Carrier OAM Requirements", Michael Georgiades, Filippo Cugini,
  David Berechya, Oscar de Dios, 2013-05-30,
  <draft-georgiades-opsawg-intercar-oam-req-04.txt>

      This draft specifies requirements for inter-carrier OAM supporting
      end-to-end OAM functionality and mechanisms development in a multi-
      operator environment. It reviews the already proposed OAM
      requirements addressed in IETF [RFC5706, RFC5860], ITU-T [Y.1730],MEF
      [MEFOAM] and IEEE [IEEE1, IEEE2] which were mainly proposed on a per
      transport technology basis, but aims to differentiate and focus on
      the requirements and additional requirements resulting from inter-
      operator considerations only.

  "File Transfer Protocol LOCK Command for Using a Single Port", Anthony
  Bryan, Daniel Stenberg, Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa, 2013-02-01,
  <draft-bryan-ftp-lock-02.txt>

      One of the biggest hurdles for FTP in real life usage is its use of
      two connections.  First, it uses a primary connection to send control
      commands on, and when it sends or receives data, it opens a second
      TCP stream for that purpose.  This document specifies a new FTP LOCK
      command to be used by clients to request the server to use the
      control connection for data transfers, using a single port instead of
      two.

  "RTP Payload Format for G.711.0", Michael Ramalho, Paul Jones, Noboru
  Harada, Muthu Perumal, Miao Lei, 2013-03-28,
  <draft-ramalho-payload-g7110-03.txt,.pdf>

      This document specifies the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)
      payload format for ITU-T Recommendation G.711.0.  ITU-T Rec.  G.711.0
      defines a lossless and stateless compression for G.711 packet
      payloads typically used in IP networks.  This document also defines a
      storage mode format for G.711.0 and a media type registration for the
      G.711.0 RTP payload format.

  "Home Agent Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6", Hidetoshi Yokota,
  Dae-Sun Kim, Behcet Sarikaya, Frank Xia, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-yokota-mext-ha-init-flow-binding-06.txt>

      There are scenarios in which the home agent needs to trigger flow
      binding operations towards the mobile node such as moving a flow from
      one access network to another based on the network resource
      availability.  In order for the home agent to be able to initiate
      interactions for flow bindings with the mobile node, this document
      defines new signaling messages and sub-options for Mobile IPv6.  Home
      agent initiated flow bindings are supported for both IPv4 and IPv6
      enabled mobile nodes.

  "Requirements of GMPLS Extensions for Energy Efficient Traffic
  Engineering", Satoru Okamoto, 2013-03-14,
  <draft-okamoto-ccamp-midori-gmpls-extension-reqs-02.txt>

      This document discusses some of extensions required in existing GMPLS
      OSPF routing protocol, RSVP signaling protocol, and LMP to support
      the energy efficient traffic engineering technology.

  "CoRE Resource Directory", Zach Shelby, Srdjan Krco, Carsten Bormann,
  2013-02-25, <draft-shelby-core-resource-directory-05.txt>

      In many M2M applications, direct discovery of resources is not
      practical due to sleeping nodes, disperse networks, or networks where
      multicast traffic is inefficient.  These problems can be solved by
      employing an entity called a Resource Directory (RD), which hosts
      descriptions of resources held on other servers, allowing lookups to
      be performed for those resources.  This document specifies the web
      interfaces that a Resource Directory supports in order for web
      servers to discover the RD and to register, maintain, lookup and
      remove resources descriptions.  Furthermore, new link attributes
      useful in conjunction with an RD are defined.

  "Supporting explicit inclusion or exclusion of abstract nodes for a
  subset of P2MP destinations in Path Computation Element Communication
  Protocol (PCEP).", Dhruv Dhody, Udayasree Palle, Venugopal Kondreddy,
  2013-04-15, <draft-dhody-pce-pcep-p2mp-per-destination-04.txt>

      The ability to determine paths of point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
      Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
      Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) is one the key
      requirements for Path Computation Element (PCE).  [RFC6006] and
      [PCE-P2MP-PROCEDURES] describes these mechanisms for intra and inter
      domain path computation via PCE.
      
      This document describes the motivation and PCE communication Protocol
      (PCEP) extension for explicitly specifying abstract nodes for
      inclusion or exclusion for a subset of destinations during the Point
      to Multipoint (P2MP) path computation via PCE.

  "Encoding of Data Structure (DS) in the Path Computation Element
  Communication Protocol (PCEP)", Dhruv Dhody, Udayasree Palle,
  2013-02-21, <draft-dhody-pce-pcep-ds-03.txt>

      The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label
      Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
      Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been
      identified as a key requirement for point-to-point (P2P) and point-
      to-multipoint (P2MP) scenarios.  Backward-Recursive Path Computation
      (BRPC) [RFC5441] defines Virtual Shortest Path Tree (VSPT) as a
      default de-facto data structure for path reply message in inter-
      domain scenarios.
      
      As Path Computation Element (PCE) will get used in newer scenarios
      like inter-domain, protection, P2MP etc.  As well as PCE is being
      explored to be used in Cross Stratrum Optimization (CSO) environment
      (see [CSO-PCE]) as well as in [ABNO].  Limiting PCE communication
      Protocol (PCEP) to just one data structure limits the usage of PCEP.
      Its important to keep PCEP generic enough to use differnt data
      structure and apply different algorithms.
      
      This document defines extensions to the PCEP to allow multiple data
      structures.  Extensions are defined for PCE to indicate the set of
      Data Structure (DS) it supports; also Path Computation Client (PCC)
      or PCE can indicate in a path computation request the required DS,
      and a PCE can report in a path computation reply the Data Structure
      that was used in the path reply message.

  "Security Framework for Virtualized Data Center Services", Suren
  Karavettil, Bhumip Khasnabish, So Ning, Wei Dong, 2012-12-26,
  <draft-karavettil-vdcs-security-framework-05.txt>

      This document discusses the requirements and technology gaps related
      to security in the virtualized data center services (VDCS).  The
      objective is to ensure end-to-end security for various types of
      carrier services built on virtualized infrastructure.  The issues
      covered in this draft are focused on confidentiality and integrity of
      the services in the virtualized environment; including but not
      limited to infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and application
      (SaaS) services.  This draft also takes into account transient nature
      of identity, resources and connectivity in the virtualized
      environment.

  "One Hop Lookups Algorithm Plugin for RELOAD", Jin Peng, Yu Qing, Yuan
  Li, 2013-02-18, <draft-peng-p2psip-one-hop-plugin-03.txt>

      This document defines a specific Topology Plugin using a ramification
      of the basic One Hop Lookups based DHT algorithm which is called ONE-
      HOP-RELOAD. In the One Hop Lookups algorithm, each peer maintains a
      full routing table containing information about every node on the
      overlay in order to route RELOAD message in one hop. Compared with
      CHORD-RELOAD algorithm, ONE-HOP-RELOAD improves the routing
      efficiency, and can maintain complete membership information with
      reasonable bandwidth requirements. This algorithm is able to handle
      frequent membership changes by superimposing a well-defined hierarchy
      on the system that guarantees topology disturbance events
      notification reach every peer in the overlay within a specified
      amount of time. Currently some typical peer-to-peer storages systems
      have stringent latency requirements, such as Amazon's Dynamo which is
      built for latency sensitive applications uses One-Hop algorithm, so
      that each node maintains enough routing information locally to route
      a request to the appropriate node directly.

  "Proposals for RELOAD to support Promotion and Demotion for User-owned
  Nodes", Jin Peng, Deng Lingli, Lifeng Le, Gang Li, Xiao Ma, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-peng-p2psip-promotion-02.txt>

      This document proposes extensions to RELOAD to support flexible
      client promotion and demotion modes.  RELOAD aims at providing a
      uniform protocol for both overlay clients and peers, where promotion
      of a client to peer is triggered and completed at the client's
      pleasure.  It is proposed that RELOAD provide a more restrictive
      framework to enable passive promotion and demotion, where decisions
      are made by the network rather than individual user-owned nodes.

  "Cisco Specific Information Elements reused in IPFIX", Andrew
  Yourtchenko, Paul Aitken, Benoit Claise, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-yourtchenko-cisco-ies-05.txt>

      This document describes some additional Information Elements of Cisco
      Systems, Inc. that are not listed in RFC3954.

  "In-Band Authentication Extension for Protocol Independent Multicast",
  Manav Bhatia, Dacheng Zhang, Bharat Joshi, 2013-03-27,
  <draft-bhatia-zhang-pim-auth-extension-03.txt>

      Existing security mechanisms for the Protocol Independent Multicast -
      Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) routing protocol mandates the use of IPsec to
      provide message authenticity and integrity.  This draft proposes an
      embedded authentication mechanism to facilitate data origin
      authentication and integrity verification for PIM packets in the
      cases where IPsec cannot be applied.

  "User-Managed Access (UMA) Profile of OAuth 2.0", Thomas Hardjono,
  2013-06-29, <draft-hardjono-oauth-umacore-07.txt>

      User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0.  UMA defines how
      resource owners can control protected-resource access by clients
      operated by arbitrary requesting parties, where the resources reside
      on any number of resource servers, and where a centralized
      authorization server governs access based on resource owner policy.

  "Context Transfer Protocol Extension for Multicast", DH, Hitoshi Asaeda,
  2013-02-12, <draft-vonhugo-multimob-cxtp-extension-03.txt>

      This document describes an extension of the Context Transfer Protocol
      (CXTP) to support seamless IP multicast services with Proxy Mobile
      IPv6 (PMIPv6).

  "RO Extensions for PMIPv6-LR (ROEXT)", Michael Boc, Christophe
  Janneteau, Alexandru Petrescu, 2013-04-22,
  <draft-boc-netext-lr-roext-05.txt>

      The communication path between two Hosts within a Proxy Mobile IPv6
      domain is artificially long - it involves the LMA, even if straight
      paths exist (under same MAG, or MAG-to-MAG).  Localized Routing
      PMIPv6-LR concepts developped by NETEXT WG make use of LRI/LRA
      messages to achieve optimized MAG-to-MAG straight paths.  This may
      prove inconvenient for the network operator, in that it may loose
      ability to control traffic (LMA control point is skipped).
      
      In this draft we present a middle-ground solution.  It employs new
      Intermediary Anchors (IAs) in the paths between MAGs and offers
      points of control of traffic useful for QoS and lawful interception.

  "Best Practices for HTTP-CoAP Mapping Implementation", Angelo
  Castellani, Salvatore Loreto, Akbar Rahman, Thomas Fossati, Esko Dijk,
  2013-02-25, <draft-castellani-core-http-mapping-07.txt>

      This draft provides reference information for HTTP-CoAP protocol
      translation proxy implementors, focusing primarily on the reverse
      proxy case.  It details deployment options, discusses possible
      approaches for URI mapping, and provides a set of guidelines and
      considerations related to protocol translation.

  "BGPSEC Design Choices and Summary of Supporting Discussions",
  Kotikalapudi Sriram, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-sriram-bgpsec-design-choices-04.txt>

      This document has been written to capture the design rationale for
      the individual draft-00 version of BGPSEC protocol specification (I-D
      .lepinski-bgpsec-protocol-00).  It lists the decisions that were made
      in favor of or against each design choice, and presents brief
      summaries of the arguments that aided the decision process.  A
      similar document can be published in the future as the BGPSEC design
      discussions make further progress and additional design
      considerations are discussed and finalized.

  "RBridge: Pseudo-Nickname", ZTE Corporation, Tissa Senevirathne, Radia
  Perlman, Donald Eastlake, Mingui Zhang, fangwei hu, 2013-06-28,
  <draft-hu-trill-pseudonode-nickname-05.txt>

      RBridges provide provide end-station services to their attached end
      stations.  To avoid potential frame duplication and loops, the rule
      that only one edge RBridge is allowed to be the frame forwarder of a
      VLAN on a shared LAN segment is employed by base TRILL protocol, even
      though there are multiple RBridges attached to that segment.
      However, in some application scenarios, for example an end station is
      multi-homed to multiple RBridges, there is a need to improve the
      resiliency and increase the available network bandwidth of the
      connection.  This means all those RBriges attached to the end station
      can act as the frame forwarders of a specific VLAN.  This kind of
      active-active connection violates the above rule.  The violation may
      bring some additional problems, such as the flip-flopping of the
      nickname-MAC correspondences for such end stations in remote
      RBridges' forwarding tables, frame dropping because of failure of
      Reverse Path Forwarding Check(RPF Check) on RBridges, etc.  The RPF
      Check problem has been addressed in [CMT].  This document proposes
      the concept of Virtual RBridge, along with the pseudo-nickname
      configuration for this Virtual RBridge, to address the above problems
      in accompany with [CMT].

  "Mediated RSA cryptography specification for additive private key
  splitting (mRSAA)", Miroslaw Kutylowski, Przemyslaw Kubiak, Michal
  Tabor, Daniel Wachnik, 2012-11-05,
  <draft-kutylowski-mrsa-algorithm-03.txt>

      This document describes recommendations for the implementation of
      public key cryptography based on the mediated RSA algorithm. The
      Mediated RSA algorithm bases on fragmentation of a private key. As a
      result the signature process consists from multiple stages. The
      verification process is the same as in the case of RSA algorithm
      [RFC3447].

  "The Universal Voting Markup Language (UVML)", Erin Phillips,
  2013-07-15, <draft-phillips-uvml-04.txt>

      This document describes the Universal Voting Markup Language (UVML),
      a syntax for the structured representation of opinion in free text.
      Using UVML, opinions can be encoded in text, image, or video, and
      reliably interpreted by either human readers or automated-agents.
      UVML supports both rating and ranking semantics.  Ratings may be
      scored using symbols associated with the five most commonly used
      opinion dimensions: quality(*), importance(!), outlook($), support-
      opposition(+), and likelihood(%).  In addition, UVML defines a syntax
      for optionally including a demographic signature by which voters can

  "PW Endpoint Fast Failure Protection", Yimin Shen, Rahul Aggarwal, Wim
  Henderickx, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-shen-pwe3-endpoint-fast-protection-04.txt>

      This document specifies a fast mechanism for protecting pseudowires
      (PWs) against egress endpoint failures, including egress attachment
      circuit failure, egress PE failure, multi-segment PW terminating PE
      failure, and multi-segment PW switching PE failure.  Designed on the
      basis of multi-homed CE, PW redundancy, upstream label assignment and
      context specific label switching, the mechanism enables local repair
      to be performed by a router upstream adjacent to a failure.  In
      particular, the router can restore PW traffic in the order of tens of
      milliseconds, by transmitting the traffic to a protector through a
      pre-established bypass tunnel.  Therefore, the mechanism can reduce
      traffic loss before global repair reacts to the failure and the
      network converges on the topology changes due to the failure.

  "Generalized Label for Super-Channel Assignment on Flexible Grid",
  Iftekhar Hussain, Zhong Pan, Marco Sosa, Andrew Malis, Abinder Dhillon,
  2013-04-13, <draft-hussain-ccamp-super-channel-label-05.txt>

      To enable scaling of existing transport systems to ultra high data
      rates of 1 Tbps and beyond, next generation systems providing super-
      channel switching capability are currently being developed. To allow
      efficient allocation of optical spectral bandwidth for such high bit
      rate systems, International Telecommunication Union
      Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is extending the
      G.694.1 grid standard (termed "Fixed-Grid") to include flexible grid
      (termed "Flex-Grid") support (draft revised ITU-T G.694.1, revision
      1.4, Oct 2011). This necessitates definition of new label format for
      the Flex-Grid. This document defines a super-channel label as a
      Super-Channel Identifier and an associated list of 12.5 GHz slices
      representing the optical spectrum of the super-channel. The label
      information can be encoded using a fixed length or variable length
      format. This label format can be used in GMPLS signaling and routing
      protocol to establish super-channel based optical label switched
      paths (LSPs).

  "The Interior Routing Overlay Network (IRON)", Fred Templin, 2013-05-03,
  <draft-templin-ironbis-15.txt>

      Since large-scale Internetworks such as the public Internet must
      continue to support escalating growth due to increasing demand, it is
      clear that Autonomous Systems (ASes) must avoid injecting excessive
      de-aggregated prefixes into the interdomain routing system and
      instead mitigate de-aggregation internally.  This document describes
      an Interior Routing Overlay Network (IRON) architecture that supports
      sustainable growth within AS-interior routing domains while requiring
      no changes to end systems and no changes to the exterior routing
      system.  In addition to routing scaling, IRON further addresses other
      important issues including mobility management, mobile networks,
      multihoming, traffic engineering, NAT traversal and security.  While
      business considerations are an important determining factor for
      widespread adoption, they are out of scope for this document.

  "Security Labels in Internet Email", Kurt Zeilenga, Alexey Melnikov,
  2013-04-04, <draft-zeilenga-email-seclabel-05.txt>

      This document describes a header field, SIO-Label, for use in
      Internet Mail to convey the sensitivity of the message.  This header
      field which may carry a textual representation (a display marking)
      and/or a structural representation (a security label) of the
      sensitivity of the message.  This document also describes a header
      field, SIO-Label-History, for recording changes in the message's
      label.

  "An Extension Language for the DNS", John Levine, Paul Vixie,
  2013-06-30, <draft-levine-dnsextlang-06.txt>

      Adding new RRTYPEs to the DNS requires that DNS servers and
      provisioning software be upgraded to support each new RRTYPE in
      Master files.  This document defines a DNS extension language
      intended to allow most new RRTYPEs to be supported by adding entries
      to configuration data read by the DNS software, with no software
      changes needed for each RRTYPE.

  "VXLAN: A Framework for Overlaying Virtualized Layer 2 Networks over

      provider and enterprise data center networks.

  "The proposal of A Uniform Resource Name (URN) Formal Namespace for the
  Local Government ICT Platform Project in Japan", Kazuaki Ohara,
  2013-06-07, <draft-kanazawa-applic-urn-02.txt>

      This document describes the Namespace Idendifier (NID) 'applic' for
      Uniform Resource Name (URN) which is used to identify resources
      released by the Association for Promotion of Public Local Information
      and Communication (APPLIC).  APPLIC publishes and manages
      specifications that define unique and persistent resources which make
      use of the namespace.
      (APPLIC is a nonprofit organization which consists of local
      governments, private companies and academic experts in Japan.)

  "Extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
  (PCEP) to compute service aware Label Switched Path (LSP).", Dhruv
  Dhody, Vishwas Manral, Zafar Ali, George Swallow, Kenji Kumaki,
  2013-02-25, <draft-dhody-pce-pcep-service-aware-05.txt>

      In certain networks like financial information network (stock/
      commodity trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications,
      Latency (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet loss is
      becoming a key requirement for path computation along with other
      constraints and metrics.  Latency, Latency-Variation and Packet Loss
      is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between
      customers and service providers.
      
      [MPLS-DELAY-FWK] describes MPLS architecture to allow Latency
      (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet loss as properties.
      [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS] describes mechanisms with
      which network performance information is distributed via OSPF and
      ISIS respectively.  This document describes the extension to PCEP to
      carry Latency, Latency-Variation and Loss as constraints for end to
      end path computation.

  "NVGRE: Network Virtualization using Generic Routing Encapsulation",
  Murari Sridharan, Albert Greenberg, Narasimhan Venkataramaiah, Yu-Shun
  Wang, Kenneth Duda, Ilango Ganga, Geng Lin, Mark Pearson, Patricia
  Thaler, Chait Tumuluri, 2013-02-24,
  <draft-sridharan-virtualization-nvgre-02.txt>

      This document describes the usage of Generic Routing Encapsulation
      (GRE) header for Network Virtualization (NVGRE) in multi-tenant
      datacenters. Network Virtualization decouples virtual networks and
      addresses from physical network infrastructure, providing isolation
      and concurrency between multiple virtual networks on the same
      physical network infrastructure. This document also introduces a
      Network Virtualization framework to illustrate the use cases, but
      the focus is on specifying the data plane aspect of NVGRE.

  "SA46T Multicast Support", Naoki Matsuhira, 2013-03-30,

      This document describe Stateless Automatic IPv4 over IPv6
      Encapsulation / Decapsutation Technology (SA46T) multicast support.
      IPv4 multicast is supported by SA46T with same manner with IPv4
      unicast.  SA46T multicast address prefix is defined.

  "TFRC-based Congestion Control for Saratoga", Wesley Eddy, Lloyd Wood,
  Will Ivancic, 2013-04-21, <draft-eddy-tsvwg-saratoga-tfrc-03.txt>

      This document specifies the use of TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC)
      with the Saratoga data transfer protocol.  The necessary conventions
      that a Saratoga sender and receiver implementation must follow if
      they wish to enable the use of TFRC are described.

  "Deterministic Address Mapping to Reduce Logging in Carrier Grade NAT
  Deployments", Chris Donley, Chris Grundemann, Vikas Sarawat, Karthik
  Sundaresan, Olivier Vautrin, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-donley-behave-deterministic-cgn-06.txt>

      In some instances, Service Providers have a legal logging requirement
      to be able to map a subscriber's inside address with the address used
      on the public Internet (e.g. for abuse response).  Unfortunately,
      many Carrier Grade NAT logging solutions require active logging of
      dynamic translations.  Carrier Grade NAT port assignments are often
      per-connection, but could optionally use port ranges.  Research
      indicates that per-connection logging is not scalable in many
      residential broadband services.  This document suggests a way to
      manage Carrier Grade NAT translations in such a way as to
      significantly reduce the amount of logging required while providing
      traceability for abuse response.  While the authors acknowledge that
      IPv6 is a preferred solution, Carrier Grade NAT is a reality in many
      networks, and is needed in situations where either customer equipment
      or Internet content only supports IPv4; this approach should in no
      way slow the deployment of IPv6.

  "Congestion control for the Saratoga protocol", Lloyd Wood, Wesley Eddy,
  Will Ivancic, 2013-04-21,
  <draft-wood-tsvwg-saratoga-congestion-control-03.txt>

      Saratoga is a data transfer protocol designed to carry potentially
      large volumes of data over difficult network paths, often including
      only a single high-rate link and only one application flow.  As the
      requirements for use vary across deployment environments, the base
      Saratoga specification only assumes that an implementation will be
      able to clock packets out at a configurable rate, and beyond this
      specifies no inherent or particular congestion-control behaviour.
      The design of Saratoga deliberately supports the integration of
      congestion-control algorithms without modification to the base
      protocol.  This document describes how congestion control can be
      supported in the Saratoga transfer protocol.  Saratoga is intended
      for use in private networks, where its use is engineered as a single
      flow to fill a link.  However, as Saratoga is implemented over UDP,
      it can be multiplexed, and can be run across the public Internet, in
      which case congestion control in accordance with the UDP Guidelines
      becomes necessary.

  "DHCP Options for 3GPP Service", Guoyan Liu, Yangwei Tu, Chunhui Zhu,
  Wim Henderickx, Daniel Derksen, Laurent Thiebaut, 2013-03-12,
  <draft-liu-dhc-3gpp-option-03.txt>

      This document defines a new option that can be used by DHCP clients
      in their signaling sent to DHCP servers, when those clients need to
      associate a request for an IP address or IPv6 prefix with a given
      3GPP packet service.It is intended for scenarios of interworking
      between a non-3GPP access and a 3GPP network.

  "HO from 3GPP to a trusted non-3GPP access", Guoyan Liu, Yangwei Tu,
  Chunhui Zhu, 2013-02-15, <draft-liu-dhc-ho-03.txt>

      This document adds DHCP client and server behavior description in a
      scenario for handover from 3GPP to a trusted non-3GPP access.

  "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Schema for Printer
  Services", Pat Fleming, Ira McDonald, 2013-05-17,
  <draft-mcdonald-ldap-printer-schema-04.txt>

      This document defines a schema, object classes and attributes, for
      Printers and Print Services, for use with directories that support
      Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (RFC 4510).  This document is
      based on the Printer attributes listed in Appendix E of Internet
      Printing Protocol/1.1 (IPP) (RFC 2911).  Additional Printer
      attributes are based on definitions in the Printer MIB v2 (RFC 3805),
      IEEE-ISTO PWG Command Set for IEEE 1284 Device ID (PWG 5107.2),
      IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 (PWG 5100.13),
      and IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP Everywhere (PWG 5100.14).
      
      This document is published by the IETF on behalf of the Internet
      Printing Protocol Working Group of the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working
      Group.
      
      This document updates RFC 3712.

  "IPv6 Prefix Assignment in Small Networks", Fred Baker, Ralph Droms,
  2012-03-07, <draft-baker-homenet-prefix-assignment-01.txt>

      It is necessary to allocate prefixes in small networks, which include
      residential and Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) networks in a manner
      that minimizes or eliminates manual configuration.  This note
      suggests an approach.

  "IANA Allocated DNS RRtype Codes Without Documentation", Edward Lewis,
  2011-10-13, <draft-lewis-dns-undocumented-types-01.txt>

      In the IANA registry of Resource Record (RR) TYPEs, as of October 1,
      2011, there are 10 type code values allocated with references that
      are individual email boxes and not stable documents.  Some of the
      registrations represent works in progress and such a reference is
      viable.  Some registrations are dormant or dead efforts.  In all
      cases it would be helpful to have some reference to material
      describing the type.

  "LDP Bindings Refresh", Andre Pelletier, Kamran Raza, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-pelletier-mpls-ldp-bindings-refresh-02.txt>

      There are situations when there is a need for performing consistency
      checks for LDP binding state (address/label bindings) exchanged
      between LDP speakers. For instance, a state refresh may be required
      to detect and purge stale bindings received by an LDP speaker, which
      have resulted from an in-service software upgrade. This document
      specifies mechanics that allow a sender LDP speaker to enclose the
      initial binding advertisements (or re-advertisements) between
      explicit START and END of binding markers, thus helping the
      receiving LDP speaker to detect and purge any extra/stale binding
      state previously learnt from the sender. In addition to the
      definition of new LDP Notification message status codes for bindings
      refresh, this document also extends LDP base specification by
      introducing the concept of "Wildcard Address" and a new "Wildcard
      Address Request" message.

  "Generalized Labels for the Flexi-Grid in Lambda Switch Capable (LSC)
  Label Switching Routers", Daniel King, Adrian Farrel, Yao Li,
  2013-04-09, <draft-farrkingel-ccamp-flexigrid-lambda-label-06.txt>

      GMPLS supports the description of optical switching by identifying
      entries in fixed lists of switchable wavelengths (called grids)
      through the encoding of lambda labels.  Work within the ITU-T Study
      Group 15 has defined a finer granularity grid, and the facility to
      flexibly select different widths of spectrum from the grid.  This
      document defines a new GMPLS lambda label format to support this
      flexi-grid.
      
      This document updates RFC 3471 and RFC 6205 by introducing a new
      label format.

  "IS-IS Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions", Stefano Previdi,
  Spencer Giacalone, David Ward, John Drake, Alia Atlas, Clarence
  Filsfils, 2013-02-25, <draft-previdi-isis-te-metric-extensions-03.txt>

      In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
      information networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network
      performance criteria (e.g. latency) are becoming as critical to data
      path selection as other metrics.
      
      This document describes extensions to IS-IS TE [RFC5305] such that
      network performance information can be distributed and collected in a
      scalable fashion.  The information distributed using ISIS TE Metric
      Extensions can then be used to make path selection decisions based on
      network performance.
      
      Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which network
      performance information is distributed.  The mechanisms for measuring
      network performance or acting on that information, once distributed,
      are outside the scope of this document.

  "Multiple RTP Sessions on a Single Lower-Layer Transport", Magnus
  Westerlund, Colin Perkins, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-westerlund-avtcore-transport-multiplexing-05.txt>

      This memo defines a mechanism to allow multiple RTP sessions to be
      multiplexed onto a single lower-layer transport flow (e.g., onto a
      single UDP 5-tuple).  Requirements for multiplexing RTP sessions are
      discussed, along with the trade-off between the different options.  A
      shim-based multiplexing layer is proposed, along with associated
      signalling.

  "Securing Header Fields with S/MIME", Laurent Cailleux, Chris Bonatti,
  2013-07-30, <draft-cailleux-secure-headers-03.txt>

      This document describes how the S/MIME protocol can be
      extended in order to secure message header fields. This
      technology provides security services such as data integrity,
      non-repudiation and confidentiality. This extension is
      referred to as 'Secure Headers'.

  "RSVP-TE Signaling Extensions in support of Flexible Grid", Fatai Zhang,
  Xian Zhang, Adrian Farrel, Oscar de Dios, Daniele Ceccarelli,
  2013-06-24, <draft-zhang-ccamp-flexible-grid-rsvp-te-ext-02.txt>

      This memo describes the extensions to RSVP-TE signaling to support
      Label Switched Paths in a GMPLS-controlled network that includes
      devices using the new flexible optical grid.

  "Multicast Support for MAP-E", Behcet Sarikaya, 2013-02-19,
  <draft-sarikaya-softwire-4rdmulticast-06.txt>

      This memo specifies MAP-E (together with MAP-T and 4rd)'s multicast
      component so that IPv4 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4
      servers over an IPv6 network.  In the encapsulation solution for
      encapsulation variant of Mapping of Address and Port (MAP), MAP-E,
      IGMP Proxy at the MAP-E Customer Edge router uses IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel
      established by MAP-E to exchange IGMP messages to establish multicast
      state at MAP-E Border Relay so that MAP-E Border Relay can tunnel
      IPv4 multicast data to IPv4 hosts connected to MAP-E Customer Edge
      device.  In the Translation Multicast solution for the translation
      variant of MAP, MAP-T and 4rd, IGMP messages are translated into MLD
      messages at the CE router which is IGMP/MLD Proxy and sent to the
      network in IPv6.  MAP-T/4rd Border Relay does the reverse translation
      and joins IPv4 multicast group for MAP-T/4rd hosts.  Border Relay as
      multicast router receives IPv4 multicast data and translates the
      packet into IPv6 multicast data and sends downstream on the multicast
      tree.  Member CEs receive multicast data, translate it back to IPv4
      and transmit to the hosts.

  "Negotiation for Keying Pairwise Routing Protocols in IKEv2", Mahesh
  Jethanandani, Brian Weis, Keyur Patel, Dacheng Zhang, Sam Hartman, Uma
  Chunduri, Albert Tian, Joseph Touch, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-mahesh-karp-rkmp-04.txt>

      This document describes a mechanism to secure the routing protocols
      which use unicast to transport their signaling messages.  Most of
      such routing protocols are TCP-based (e.g., BGP and LDP), and the TCP
      Authentication Option (TCP-AO) is primarily employed for securing the
      signaling messages of these routing protocols.  There are also two
      exceptions: BFD which is over UDP or MPLS, and RSVP-TE which is over
      IP (but employs an integrated approach to protecting the signaling
      messages instead of using IPsec).  The proposed mechanism secures
      pairwise TCP-based Routing Protocol (RP) associations, BFD
      associations and RSVP-TE associations using the IKEv2 Key Management
      Protocol (KMP) integrated with TCP-AO, BFD, and RSVP-TE respectively.
      Included are extensions to IKEv2 and its Security Associations to
      enable its key negotiation to support TCP-AO, BFD, and RSVP-TE.

  "PIM flooding mechanism and source discovery", IJsbrand Wijnands, Stig
  Venaas, Michael Brig, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-wijnands-pim-source-discovery-bsr-03.txt>

      PIM Sparse-Mode uses a Rendezvous Point (RP) and shared trees to
      forward multicast packets to Last Hop Routers (LHR).  After the first
      packet is received by the LHR, the source of the multicast stream is
      learned and the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) can be joined.  This draft
      proposes a solution to support PIM Sparse Mode (SM) without the need
      for PIM registers, RPs or shared trees.  Multicast source information
      is flooded throughout the multicast domain using a new generic PIM
      flooding mechanism.  This mechanism is defined in this document, and
      is modeled after the PIM Bootstrap Router protocol.  By removing the
      need for RPs and shared trees, the PIM-SM procedures are simplified,
      improving router operations, management and making the protocol more
      robust.

  "Support for Long-lived BGP Graceful Restart", Jim Uttaro, Enke Chen,
  Bruno Decraene, John Scudder, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-uttaro-idr-bgp-persistence-02.txt>

      In this document we introduce a new BGP capability termed "Long-lived
      Graceful Restart Capability" so that stale routes can be retained for
      a longer time upon session failure.  In addition a new BGP community
      "LLGR_STALE" is introduced for marking stale routes retained for a
      longer time.  We also specify that such long-lived stale routes be
      treated as the least-preferred, and their advertisements be limited
      to BGP speakers that have advertised the new capability.  Use of this
      extension is not advisable in all cases, and we provide guidelines to
      help determine if it is.

  "Reactions to Signaling from ECN Support for RTP/RTCP", Ken Carlberg,
  Piers O'Hanlon, 2013-03-08, <draft-carlberg-tsvwg-ecn-reactions-04.txt>

      This document presents an examination of various responses to Congestion
      Experience (CE) notifications by real time applications that have
      negotiated end-to-end support of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).
      This document is a follow-on effort of [rfc6679], which specifies the
      signaling used to provide ECN support for RTP/RTCP flows.

      delegation and address allocation using the meta data for selection
      of prefixes and addresses.

  "OSPF Topology-Transparent Zone", Huaimo Chen, Renwei Li, Gregory
  Cauchie, Alvaro Retana, So Ning, Mehmet Toy, Lei Liu, 2013-07-17,
  <draft-chen-ospf-ttz-06.txt>

      This document presents a topology-transparent zone in a domain.  A
      topology-transparent zone comprises a group of routers and a number
      of links connecting these routers.  Any router outside of the zone is
      not aware of the zone.  The information about the links and routers
      inside the zone is not distributed to any router outside of the zone.
      Any link state change such as a link down inside the zone is not seen
      by any router outside of the zone.

  "Extended IPv6 Addressing for Encoding Port Range", Congxiao Bao, Xing
  Li, 2013-06-24, <draft-bcx-behave-address-fmt-extension-04.txt>

      This document discusses an extension of the algorithmic translation
      between IPv4 and IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.  The extended
      address format contains transport-layer port set identification
      (PSID) which allows several IPv6 nodes to share a single IPv4 address
      with each node managing a different range of ports.  This address
      format extension can be used for IPv4/IPv6 translation, as well as
      IPv4 over IPv6 tunneling.

  Jasinska, Robert Raszuk, Niels Bakker, 2013-06-07,
  <draft-hilliard-ix-bgp-route-server-operations-03.txt>

      The popularity of Internet exchange points (IXPs) brings new
      challenges to interconnecting networks.  While bilateral eBGP
      sessions between exchange participants were historically the most
      common means of exchanging reachability information over an IXP, the
      overhead associated with this interconnection method causes serious
      operational and administrative scaling problems for IXP participants.
      
      Multilateral interconnection using Internet route servers can
      dramatically reduce the administrative and operational overhead of
      IXP participation and these systems used by many IXP participants as
      a preferred means of exchanging routing information.
      
      This document describes operational considerations for multilateral
      interconnections at IXPs.

  "Prefix Assignment in a Home Network", Jari Arkko, Acee Lindem, Benjamin
  Paterson, 2013-05-23, <draft-arkko-homenet-prefix-assignment-04.txt>

      This memo describes a prefix assignment mechanism for home networks.
      It is expected that home gateway routers are allocated an IPv6 prefix
      through DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (PD) or that a prefix is made
      available through other means.  This prefix needs to be divided among
      the multiple subnets in a home network.  This memo describes a
      mechanism for such division, or assignment, via OSPFv3.  This is an
      alternative design to also using DHCPv6 PD for the assignment.  The
      memo is input to the working group so that it can make a decision on
      which type of design to pursue.  It is expected that a routing-
      protocol based assignment uses a minimal amount of prefixes.

  "Cross Stratum Optimization Architecture for Optical as a Service", Hui
  Yang, Yongli Zhao, Jie Zhang, Young Lee, Yi Lin, Fatai Zhang,
  2013-06-27, <draft-yangh-cso-oaas-04.txt>

      Data centers based applications provide a wide variety of services
      such as cloud computing, video gaming, grid application and others.
      Currently application decisions are made with little information
      concerning underlying network used to deliver those services so that
      such decisions cannot be the most optimal from both network and
      application resource utilization and quality of service objectives.
      
      This document presents a novel architecture of Cross Stratum
      Optimization for application and network resource in dynamic optical
      networks.  Several global load balancing strategies are proposed and
      demonstrated by experiments in Optical as a Service experimental
      environment.

  Protocol", Margaret Wasserman, Sam Hartman, Josh Howlett, 2013-02-27,
  <draft-mrw-abfab-trust-router-02.txt>

      A Trust Router is an infrastucture element used to construct multihop
      Application Bridging for Federated Authentication Beyond the Web
      (ABFAB) federations.  This document defines both the Trust Router
      Protocol and the Temporary Identity Protocol, which can be used
      together to enable multihop ABFAB federations without requiring a
      centralized Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

  "Algorithms for computing Maximally Redundant Trees for IP/LDP Fast-
  Reroute", Gabor Envedi, Andras Csaszar, Alia Atlas, 
  cbowers@juniper.net, Abishek Gopalan, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-enyedi-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm-03.txt>

      A complete solution for IP and LDP Fast-Reroute using Maximally
      Redundant Trees is presented in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-
      architecture].  This document defines the associated MRT Lowpoint
      algorithm that is used in the default MRT profile to compute both the
      necessary Maximally Redundant Trees with their associated next-hops
      and the alternates to select for MRT-FRR.

  "Using Simulcast in RTP Sessions", Magnus Westerlund, BoB, Morgan
  Lindqvist, Fredrik Jansson, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-westerlund-avtcore-rtp-simulcast-02.txt>

      In some applications it may be necessary to send multiple media
      encodings derived from the same media source in independent RTP media
      streams.  This is called Simulcast.  This document discusses the best
      way of accomplishing this in RTP and how to signal it in SDP.  It is
      concluded that a solution where the different simulcast versions are
      based on separate SDP media descriptions provides best support for
      simulcast.  A solution is defined by making two extensions to SDP.
      The first extension consists of two new attributes in SDP that
      express capability to send or receive simulcast streams,
      respectively.  The second extension describes how to group media
      descriptions belonging to the same simulcast source by using the
      grouping framework.

  "2547 egress PE Fast Failure Protection", Jeyananth Jeganathan, Hannes
  Gredler, Bruno Decraene, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-minto-2547-egress-node-fast-protection-02.txt>

      This document specifies a fast-protection mechanism for protecting
      [RFC2547] based VPN service against egress node failure.  This
      mechanism enables local repair to be performed immediately upon a
      egress node failure.  In particular, the routers upstream to egress
      node could redirect VPN traffic to a protector (a new role) to repair
      in the order of tens of milliseconds, achieving fast protection that
      is comparable to MPLS fast reroute.

  "Transport of CoAP over SMS, USSD and GPRS", Markus Becker, Kepeng Li,
  Koojana Kuladinithi, Thomas Poetsch, 2013-02-04,
  <draft-becker-core-coap-sms-gprs-03.txt>

      The Short Message Service (SMS) and Unstructured Supplementary
      Service Data (USSD) of mobile cellular networks is frequently used in
      Machine-To-Machine (M2M) communications, such as for telematic
      devices.  The service offers small packet sizes and high delays just
      as other typical low-power and lossy networks (LLNs), i.e. 6LoWPANs.
      The design of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), that took
      the limitations of LLNs into account, is thus also applicable to
      telematic M2M devices.  The adaptation of CoAP to the SMS or USSD
      transport mechanisms and the combination with IP transported over
      cellular networks is described in this document.

  "MPLS-TP protection for interconnected rings", Guoman Liu, Masahiro
  Daikoku, Takeshi Maruyama, 2013-04-22,
  <draft-liu-mpls-tp-interconnected-ring-protection-04.txt>

      The requirements for MPLS Transport Profile include a requirement
      (R93) that requires MPLS-TP must support recovery mechanisms for a
      network constructed from interconnected rings that protect user data
      that traverses more than one ring.  In particular, This includes
      protecting against cases of failure at the ring-interconnect nodes
      and links.  This document presents different scenario of
      interconnected rings and special mechanism to address recovery of the
      failure of ring-interconnect nodes and links.  .
      
      This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
      Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
      Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include
      an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
      to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
      network as defined by the ITU-T.

  "Problem Statement: TRILL Active/Active Edge", Mingui Zhang, Donald
  Eastlake, 2013-02-17, <draft-zhang-trill-aggregation-03.txt>

      This document specifies TRILL active/active edge which allows
      multiple RBridges concurrently forward data frames of the same VLAN
      on links bundled by Link Aggregation. With this kind of connection,
      end nodes may increase the bandwidth and reliability of the access at
      the edge of TRILL campuses. It's required that no loop or duplication
      is caused by this new connection type. Besides this basic
      requirement, this document outlines other potential issues associated
      with TRILL active/active edge and investigates how these issues may
      be addressed.

  "mLDP Extensions for Multi Topology Routing", IJsbrand Wijnands, Kamran
  Raza, 2013-06-20, <draft-iwijnand-mpls-mldp-multi-topology-03.txt>

      The Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) enables service differentiation
      through class-based forwarding. IGP protocols (OSPF and IS-IS) have
      already been extended to setup MTR. In order to deploy mLDP in an
      MTR network, mLDP is also required to become topology-aware. This
      document specifies extensions to mLDP to support Multi-Topology
      Routing.

  "Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP), Compressed Bundle Header
  Encoding (CBHE), and Bundle Protocol IANA Registries", Keith Scott, Marc
  Blanchet, 2013-05-10, <draft-dtnrg-ltp-cbhe-registries-05.txt>

      The DTNRG research group has defined the experimental Licklider
      Transmission Protocol (LTP) [RFC5326] and the Compressed Bundle
      Header Encoding (CBHE) [RFC6260] mechanism for the 'ipn' URI scheme.
      Finally, RFC5050 [RFC5050] defines values for the Bundle
      Administrative Record Type.  All of these describe fields that are
      subject to a registry.  For the purpose of its research work, the
      group has created ad-hoc registries.  As the specifications are
      stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the group
      would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official custody.
      This document describes the actions needed to be executed by IANA.

  "A General Framework of Source Address Validation and Traceback for
  IPv4/IPv6 Transition Scenarios", Hui Deng, Guangwu Hu, Jun Bi, Mingwei
  Xu, Fan Shi, 2013-05-07, <draft-xu-savi-transition-03.txt>

      IP spoofing always is bothering us along with the Internet invention.
      With the rapid development of IPv6 next generation Internet, this
      issue is more prominent. Though many studies have made their
      contributions to the prevention of IP-spoofing, the most excellent
      one is the SAVI (Source Address Validation Improvement) proposal
      advocated by IETF, since it can prevent IP-spoofing from happening by
      automatically binding the key properties of hosts in layer2 access
      subnet. Nevertheless, till now, SAVI only focuses on the IPv6 stack
      and simple network access scenarios. To the best of our knowledge,
      there is no solution even has paid attention to IPv4/IPv6 transition
      scenarios. Given the fact that IPv4/IPv6 transition will continue to
      be adopted for a long period of time, this issue is becoming
      increasingly urgent. However, since transition schemes are plenty and
      diverse, hardly can an ordinary solution satisfy all the requirements
      of various transition scenarios. In this document, we present an
      improved general SAVI-based framework of IP source address validation
      and traceback for IPv4/IPv6 transition scenarios. To achieve this
      goal, we extract essential and mutual properties from these
      transition schemes, and create sub-solutions for each property.
      Naturally, if one transition scheme is proposed by combining some
      properties, the corresponding sub-solutions would be included into
      its IP source address validation and traceback solution. Therefore,
      the advantage of this framework is its capability to adapt to all the
      transition schemes.

  "SAVI Requirements and Solutions for ISP IPv6 Access Network", Fan Shi,
  Hui Deng, Liang Zhu, Guangwu Hu, 2013-05-07,
  <draft-shi-savi-access-03.txt>

      Internet is always confronted with many security threats based on IP
      address spoofing which can enable impersonation and malicious traffic
      redirection. Unfortunately, the Internet architecture fails to
      provide the defense mechanism. Source Address Validation Improvement
      (SAVI) was developed to prevent IP source address spoofing.
      Especially, the mechanism is essential for ISPs. However, due to the
      diversity of address assignment methods, SAVI solution is also
      different accordingly. This document describes five scenarios of
      ISPs'IPv6 access network, and moreover, states its SAVI requirements
      and tentative solutions accordingly.

  "Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless Communication", Emmanuel Baccelli, Charles
  Perkins, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-baccelli-manet-multihop-communication-02.txt>

      This document describes characteristics of communication between
      nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network, that protocol engineers
      and system analysts should be aware of when designing solutions for
      ad hoc networks at the IP layer.

  "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) on Link Aggregation Group
  (LAG) Interfaces", Manav Bhatia, Mach Chen, Sami Boutros, Marc
  Binderberger, Jeffrey Haas, 2013-04-12, <draft-mmm-bfd-on-lags-07.txt>

      This document proposes a mechanism to run BFD on Link Aggregation
      Group (LAG) interfaces.  It does so by running an independent
      Asynchronous mode BFD session on every LAG member link.
      
      This mechanism allows the verification of member link continuity,
      either in combination with, or in absence of, LACP.  It provides a
      shorter detection time than what LACP offers.  The continuity check
      can also cover elements of layer 3 bidirectional forwarding.
      
      This mechanism utilizes a well-known UDP port distinct from that of
      single-hop BFD over IP.  This new UDP port removes the ambiguity of
      BFD over LAG packets from BFD over single-hop IP.

  "Security Implications of IPv6 Options of Type 10xxxxxx", Fernando Gont,
  Will Liu, 2013-03-20, <draft-gont-6man-ipv6-smurf-amplifier-03.txt>

      When an IPv6 node processing an IPv6 packet does not support an IPv6
      option whose two-highest-order bits of the Option Type are '10', it
      is required to respond with an ICMPv6 Parameter Problem error
      message, even if the Destination Address of the packet was a
      multicast address.  This feature provides an amplification vector,
      opening the door to an IPv6 version of the 'Smurf' Denial-of-Service
      (DoS) attack found in IPv4 networks.  This document discusses the
      security implications of the aforementioned options, and formally
      updates RFC 2460 and RFC 4443 such that this attack vector is
      eliminated.  Additionally, it describes a number of operational
      mitigations that could be deployed against this attack vector.

  "More Accurate ECN Feedback in TCP", Mirja Kuehlewind, Richard
  Scheffenegger, 2013-06-20, <draft-kuehlewind-tcpm-accurate-ecn-02.txt>

      Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an IP/TCP mechanism where
      network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to
      indicate congestion to the end-points.  ECN-capable receivers will
      feedback this information to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP in
      such a way that only one feedback signal can be transmitted per
      Round-Trip Time (RTT).  Recently, new TCP mechanisms like ConEx or
      DCTCP need more accurate ECN feedback information in the case where
      more than one marking is received in one RTT.  This document
      specifies a different scheme for the ECN feedback in the TCP header
      to provide more than one feedback signal per RTT.  Furthermore this
      document specifies a re-use of the Urgent Pointer in the TCP header
      if the URG flag is not set to increase the robustness of the proposed
      ECN feedback scheme.

  "p2mp pw protection for MPLS-TP network", Guoman Liu, 2013-06-09,
  <draft-liu-pwe3-mpls-tp-p2mp-pw-protection-03.txt>

      The requirements of MPLS-TP in RFC 5654 include a requirement(R63)
      that requires MPLS-TP MUST be possible to provide protection for
      MPLS-TP data plane without any IP forwarding capability and control
      plane.If applying 1:1 protection mechanism for the p2mp traffic in
      rfc6718 , it must have a return path to coordinate switch state to
      select the same path to receive and send traffic packet.For the above
      problem,this document describes a kind of protection solution to
      recovery and protect the p2mp traffic under the failure condition.
      
      
      This document is a product of a joint Internet Task Force(IETF) /
      International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
      Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
      Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the

  "CoRE Interfaces", Zach Shelby, Matthieu Vial, 2013-03-16,
  <draft-shelby-core-interfaces-05.txt>

      This document defines well-known REST interface descriptions for
      Batch, Sensor, Parameter and Actuator types for use in contrained web
      servers using the CoRE Link Format.  A short reference is provided
      for each type that can be efficiently included in the interface
      description attribute of the CoRE Link Format.  These descriptions
      are intended to be for general use in resource designs or for
      inclusion in more specific interface profiles.  In addition, this
      document defines the concepts of Function Set and Binding.  The
      former is the basis element to create RESTful profiles and the latter
      helps the configuration of links between resources located on one or
      more endpoints.

  "Support of fragmentation of RADIUS packets", Alejandro Perez-Mendez,
  Rafael Lopez, Fernando Pereniguez-Garcia, Gabriel Lopez-Millan, Diego
  Lopez, Alan DeKok, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-perez-radext-radius-fragmentation-06.txt>

      The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol is
      limited to a total packet size of 4096 octets.  Provisions exist for
      fragmenting large amounts of authentication data across multiple
      packets, via Access-Challenge.  No similar provisions exist for
      fragmenting large amounts of authorization data.  This document
      specifies how existing RADIUS mechanisms can be leveraged to provide
      that functionality.  These mechanisms are largely compatible with
      existing implementations, and are designed to be invisible to
      proxies, and "fail-safe" to legacy clients and servers.

  "Overlay Path Option for IP and TCP", Brandon Williams, 2013-06-19,
  <draft-williams-overlaypath-ip-tcp-rfc-04.txt>

      Data transport through overlay networks often uses either connection
      termination or network address translation (NAT) in such a way that
      the public IP addresses of the true endpoint machines involved in the
      data transport are invisible to each other.  This document describes
      IPv4, IPv6, and TCP options for communicating this information from
      the overlay network to the endpoint machines.

  "A PMIPv6-based solution for Distributed Mobility Management", Carlos
  Bernardos, Antonio de la Oliva, Fabio Giust, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-bernardos-dmm-pmip-02.txt>

      The number of mobile users and their traffic demand is expected to be
      ever-increasing in future years, and this growth can represent a
      limitation for deploying current mobility management schemes that are
      intrinsically centralized, e.g., Mobile IPv6 and Proxy Mobile IPv6.
      For this reason it has been waved a need for distributed and dynamic
      mobility management approaches, with the objective of reducing
      operators' burdens, evolving to a cheaper and more efficient
      architecture.
      
      This draft describes multiple solutions for network-based distributed
      mobility management inspired by the well known Proxy Mobile IPv6.

  "Problem Statement of SAVI Beyond the First Hop", Jun Bi, Bingyang Liu,
  2013-05-27, <draft-bi-savi-problem-05.txt>

      IETF Source Address Validation Improvements (SAVI) working group is
      chartered for source address validation within the first hop from the
      end hosts, i.e. preventing a node from spoofing the IP source address
      of another node in the same IP link.  However, since SAVI requires
      the edge routers or switches to be upgraded, the deployment of SAVI
      will need a long time.  During this transition period, some source
      address validation techniques beyond the first hop (SAVI-BF) may be
      needed to complement SAVI and protect the networks from spoofing
      based attacks.  In this document, we first propose three desired
      features of the SAVI-BF techniques.  Then we analyze the problems of
      the current SAVI-BF technique, ingress filtering.  Finally, we
      discuss the directions that we can explore to improve SAVI-BF.

  "Observations of RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy
  Networks", Thomas Clausen, Axel Verdiere, Jiazi Yi, Ulrich Herberg,
  Yuichi Igarashi, 2013-02-25, <draft-clausen-lln-rpl-experiences-06.txt>

      With RPL - the "IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-power Lossy Networks" -
      having been published as a Proposed Standard after a ~2-year
      development cycle, this document presents an evaluation of the
      resulting protocol, of its applicability, and of its limits.  The
      documents presents a selection of observations of the protocol
      characteristics, exposes experiences acquired when producing various
      prototype implementations of RPL, and presents results obtained from
      testing this protocol - by way of network simulations, in network
      testbeds and in deployments.  The document aims at providing a better
      understanding of possible limits of RPL, notably the possible
      directions that further protocol developments should explore, in
      order to address these.

  2013-06-13, <draft-kreeger-nvo3-overlay-cp-04.txt>

      The document "Problem Statement: Overlays for Network Virtualization"
      discusses the needs for network virtualization using overlay networks
      in highly virtualized data centers.  The problem statement outlines a
      need for control protocols to facilitate running these overlay
      networks.  This document outlines the high level requirements to be
      fulfilled by the control protocols related to building and managing
      the mapping tables and other state information used by the Network
      Virtualization Edge to transmit encapsulated packets across the
      underlying network.

      When IP multicast trees created by PIM-SM in ASM mode need to pass
      through an MPLS domain, it may be desirable to map such trees to
      Point-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths. This document describes how
      to accomplish this in the case where such Point-to-Multipoint Label
      Switches Paths are established using mLDP.

  "Content De-duplication for CDNi Optimization", WeiYi Jin, Mian Li,
  Bhumip Khasnabish, 2013-03-28,
  <draft-jin-cdni-content-deduplication-optimization-04.txt>

      Recent explosive growth of content delivery/distribution networks
      (CDNs) and their interconnection are causing unintended repetition of
      content storage in the same dCDN.  This can be avoided by using a
      suitable de-duplication mechanism.  This document explores the
      scenarios which create the problem, and then discusses the approaches
      to eliminate the duplicated transmission of the same content from
      uCDN(s) to dCDN in CDNi networks.  To implement the optimization,
      some enhancement to the CDNi metadata model and interface is
      required.
      
      We realize that for business-specific purposes the same content may
      be encrypted/packaged with different keys for different providers.
      The impact of DRM (Digital Rights Management) technology on de-
      duplication will be discussed in a future version of this draft.

  "Reducing Power Consumption using BGP", Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat,
  Gaurav Raina, 2013-04-27, <draft-mjsraman-rtgwg-inter-as-psp-06.txt>

      In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
      consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between
      Autonomous Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS
      and then use Traffic Engineering (TE) techniques to route the packets
      along the paths. Such low-power paths can be identified by using the
      consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth (PWR) ratio as an additional
      constraint in the Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm.
      For re-routing the data traffic through these low-power paths, the
      Inter-AS Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans
      multiple AS can be used. Extensions to the Border Gateway Protocol
      (BGP) can be used to disseminate the PWR ratio metric among the AS
      thereby creating a collaborative approach to reduce the power
      consumption. Since calculating the low-power paths can be
      computationally intensive, a graph-labeling heuristic is also
      proposed. This heuristic reduces the computational complexity but may
      provide a sub-optimal low-power path. The feasibility of our
      approaches is illustrated by applying our algorithm to a subset of
      the Internet. The techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-AS
      power reduction require minimal modifications to the existing
      features of the Internet. The proposed techniques can be extended to
      other levels of Internet hierarchy, such as Intra-AS paths, through
      suitable modifications.

  Lennox, 2013-02-01, <draft-even-clue-rtp-mapping-05.txt>

      This document describes mechanisms and recommended practice for
      mapping RTP media streams defined in SDP to CLUE media captures.

  "Cross Stratum Optimization enabled Path Computation", Dhruv Dhody,
  Young Lee, Nicola Ciulli, Luis Contreras, Oscar de Dios, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-dhody-pce-cso-enabled-path-computation-03.txt>

      Applications like cloud computing, video gaming, HD Video streaming,
      Live Concerts, Remote Medical Surgery, etc are offered by Data
      Centers.  These data centers are geographically distributed and
      connected via a network.  Many decisions are made in the Application
      space without any concern of the underlying network.  Cross stratum
      application/network optimization focus on the challenges and
      opportunities presented by data center based applications and
      carriers networks together [CSO-DATACNTR].
      
      Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block for
      traffic engineering systems such as Multiprotocol Label Switching
      (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
      networks.  [RFC4655] explains the architecture for a Path Computation
      Element (PCE)-based model to address this problem space.
      
      This document explains the architecture for CSO enabled Path
      Computation.

  "Request Routing Redirection Interface for CDN Interconnection", Wang
  Danhua, Ben Niven-Jenkins, Xiaoyan He, Ge Chen, Wei Ni, 2013-03-31,
  <draft-he-cdni-routing-request-redirection-05.txt>

      The Request Routing Interface comprises of (1) the asynchronous
      advertisement of footprint and capabilities by a downstream CDN that
      allows a upstream CDN to decide whether to redirect particular user
      requests to that downstream CDN; and (2) the synchronous operation of
      an upstream CDN requesting whether a downstream CDN is prepared to
      accept a user request and of a downstream CDN responding with how to
      actually redirect the user request.  This document describes an
      interface for the latter part, i.e.  the CDNI request routing/
      Redirection Interface.

  "Conditional observe in CoAP", Shitao Li, Jeroen Hoebeke, Floris Van den
  Abeele, Antonio Jara, 2013-06-23,
  <draft-li-core-conditional-observe-04.txt>

      CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and
      networks.  Through the Observe option, clients can observe changes in
      the state of resources and obtain a current representation of the
      last resource state.  This document defines a new mechanism in CoAP
      Observe so that a CoAP client can conditionally observe a resource on
      a CoAP server, only being informed about state changes meeting a
      specific condition or set of conditions.  This offers possibilities
      to extend network intelligence, enhance scalability, and optimize the
      lifetime and performance in order to address the requirements from
      the Constrained Nodes and Networks.

  "Tunneling Compressed Multiplexed Traffic Flows (TCM-TF)", Jose Saldana,
  Dan Wing, Julian Navajas, Muthu Perumal, Fernando Blanco, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-saldana-tsvwg-tcmtf-05.txt,.pdf>

      Tunneling Compressed and Multiplexed Traffic Flows (TCM-TF) is a
      method for improving the bandwidth utilization of network segments
      that carry multiple flows in parallel sharing a common path.  The
      method combines standard protocols for header compression,
      multiplexing, and tunneling over a network path for the purpose of
      reducing the bandwidth used when multiple flows are carried over that
      path.  The amount of packets per second can also be reduced.
      
      This document describes the TCM-TF framework and the different
      options which can be used for each layer (header compression,
      multiplexing and tunneling).

  "Reverse DNS Naming Convention for CIDR Address Blocks", Joe Gersch, Dan
  Massey, Eric Osterweil, Cathie Olschanowsky, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-gersch-dnsop-revdns-cidr-04.txt>

      This draft proposes a naming convention for encoding CIDR address
      blocks into the reverse DNS namespace.  The reverse DNS naming method
      is commonly used to specify a complete IP address.  This document
      describes how to encode an IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR address block such as
      129.82.128.0/17.  By defining a common naming convention, one can
      associate information with a prefix.  The convention builds on past
      work in RFC 1101 that associates network names with prefixes.
      However, this previous work pre-dated the introduction of CIDR and
      has several critical ambiguities.  This convention corrects the
      ambiguities and enables new applications ranging from routing
      information to geolocation.

  "SNMPD to use cache and shared database based on MIB Classification",
  Haresh Khandelwal, 2012-03-29,
  <draft-haresh-sushrut-mib-classification-01.txt>

      This memo defines classification of SNMP MIBs to either use SNMP
      cache database and shared database (SDB) mechanism to reduce high CPU
      usage while SNMP GET REQUEST, GETNEXT REQUEST, GETBULK REQUEST are
      continuously performed from network management system (NMS)/SNMP
      manager/SNMP MIB browser to managed device.

  "Default Nickname Based Approach for Multilevel TRILL", Tissa
  Senevirathne, Les Ginsberg, Sam Aldrin, Ayan Banerjee, 2013-05-28,
  <draft-tissa-trill-multilevel-02.txt>

      Multilevel TRILL allows the interconnection of multiple TRILL
      networks to form a larger TRILL network without proportionally
      increasing the size of the IS-IS LSP DB. In this document, an
      approach based on default route concept is presented. Also,
      presented in the document is a novel method of constructing multi-
      destination trees using partial nickname space. Methods presented in
      this document are compatible with the RFC6325 specified data plane
      operations.

  "A Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Usage for REsource LOcation
  And Discovery (RELOAD)", Jaime Jimenez, Jose Lopez-Vega, Jouni Maenpaa,
  Gonzalo Camarillo, 2013-02-17, <draft-jimenez-p2psip-coap-reload-03.txt>

      This document defines a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Usage
      for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD).  The CoAP Usage
      provides the functionality to federate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
      in a peer-to-peer fashion.  The CoAP Usage also provides a rendezvous
      service for CoAP Nodes and caching of sensor information.  The RELOAD
      AppAttach method is used to establish a direct connection between
      nodes through which CoAP messages are exchanged.

  "Pro-active connectivity monitoring for TRILL", Rohit Watve, Tissa
  Senevirathne, Chandan Mishra, Gayatri Ramachandran, 2013-02-04,
  <draft-rohit-trill-proactive-oam-02.txt>

      Pro-active fault monitoring for TRILL monitors all the paths between
      any two given RBridges in the network. Number of paths to be
      monitored can be of exponential order based on the distance between
      two RBridges. In this document novel fault monitoring mechanism
      based on a distributed approach is presented.

  "RTP Payload Format for High Efficiency Video Coding", Thomas Schierl,
  Stephan Wenger, Ye-Kui Wang, Miska Hannuksela, Yago Sanchez, 2013-06-11,
  <draft-schierl-payload-rtp-h265-03.txt>

      This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding
      standard  ITU-T  Recommendation  H.265  and  ISO/IEC  International
      Standard 23008-2, both also known as High Efficiency Video Coding
      (HEVC) [HEVC], developed by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video
      Coding (JCT-VC).  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of
      one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet
      payload, as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP
      packets.  Furthermore, it supports transmission of an HEVC stream
      over a single as well as multiple RTP flows.  The payload format has
      wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming,
      and high bit-rate entertainment-quality video, among others.

  "CoAP Option Extension: Patience", Kepeng Li, Bert Greevenbosch, Esko
  Dijk, Salvatore Loreto, 2013-04-23,
  <draft-li-core-coap-patience-option-02.txt>

      CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and
      networks.  This specification provides a simple extension for CoAP,
      the Patience option.  This option informs a recipient of the
      preferred time frame for a request or response depending on usage
      context.  In a unicast request, it indicates the patience a client
      has in waiting for a response.  The CoAP server tries to return the
      response within the specified time frame.  In a multicast request, it
      indicates the patience a server should have in sending its response.
      The recipient would then try to randomly delay its response within
      the time frame that the requester indicated or computed by the
      recipient itself.  In a CoAP observe notification, it indicates the
      patience an observer should have in both waiting for a subsequent
      notification and in re-establishing an observation relation.

  "DNS Resource Records for Authorized Routing Information", Joe Gersch,
  Dan Massey, Cathie Olschanowsky, Lixia Zhang, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-gersch-grow-revdns-bgp-02.txt>

      This draft discusses the use of two DNS record types for storing BGP
      routing information in the reverse DNS.  The RLOCK record allows
      prefix owners to indicate whether the DNS is being used to publish
      routing data.  The SRO record allows operators to indicate whether an
      IPv4 or IPv6 prefix ought to appear in global routing tables and
      identifies authorized origin Autonomous System Number(s) for that
      prefix.  The resulting published data can be used in a variety of
      contexts from routing security to address ownership.

  "OSPF extensions for support spectrum sub-band allocation", Qilei Wang,
  Xihua Fu, 2013-02-26,

      This document addresses the requirements and routing protocol
      extension of spectrum sub-band allocation in order to help reduce
      non-linear effect and raise spectrum utilization rate in the scenario
      of indiscriminately positioning of various channels with different
      bit rates.

  "PCP Server Discovery with IPv4 traffic offload for Proxy Mobile IPv6",
  Tirumaleswar Reddy, Prashanth Patil, Ravikumar Chandrasekaran, Dan Wing,
  2013-02-11, <draft-rpcw-pcp-pmipv6-serv-discovery-02.txt>

      This document proposes a solution to PCP Server Discovery problems in
      Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) networks when both home network traffic
      and traffic off-loaded to local access network require traversing a
      gateway implementing NAT and/or Firewall.  This draft proposes
      enhancements to DHCPv4 Relay Agent by introducing a new sub-option
      under DHCPv4 Relay Option and to PMIPv6 signaling through additional
      options to Proxy Binding Update/Acknowledgement messages.

  "End-to-End Object Encryption and Signatures for the Extensible
  Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)", Matthew Miller, 2013-06-13,
  <draft-miller-xmpp-e2e-06.txt>

      This document defines two methods for securing objects (often
      referred to as stanzas) for the Extensible Messaging and Presence
      Protocol (XMPP), which allows for efficient asynchronous
      communication between two entities, each with might have multiple
      devices operating simultaneously.  One is a method to encrypt stanzas
      to provide confidentiality protection; another is a method to sign
      stanzas to provide authentication and integrity protection.  This
      document also defines a related protocol for entities to request the
      ephemeral session keys in use.

  "Constructing power optimal P2MP TE-LSPs within an AS", Shankar Raman,
  Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-mjsraman-pce-power-replic-02.txt>

      Power consumption in multicast replication operations is an area of
      concern and choosing suitable replication points that can decrease
      power consumption overall assumes importance. Multicast replication
      capacity is an attribute of every line card of major routers and
      multi-layer switches that support multicast in the core of an
      Internet Service Provider (ISP) or an enterprise network.
      
      Currently multicast replication points on Point-to-Multipoint Traffic
      Engineering Label-Switched-Paths (P2MP TE-LSPs) consume power while
      delivering multiple output streams of data from a given input stream.
      The multicast distribution trees are constructed without any regard
      for a proper placement of the replication points and consequent
      optimal power consumption at these points.
      
      This results in overloading certain routers while under-utilizing
      others. An optimal usage of these replication resources could
      substantially reduce power consumption on these routers. In this
      paper, we propose a mechanism by which P2MP TE-LSPs are constructed
      for carrying multicast traffic across multiple areas within a given
      AS. We propose that these LSPs be built by using the advertisements
      of the power-replication capacity ratio advertised by fine grained
      components such as multicast capable line-cards of routers and multi-
      layer switches deployed within an AS.

  "A Stateless Transport Tunneling Protocol for Network Virtualization
  (STT)", Bruce Davie, Jesse Gross, 2013-03-12, <draft-davie-stt-03.txt>

      Network Virtualization places unique requirements on tunneling
      protocols.  This draft describes STT (Stateless Transport Tunneling),
      a tunnel encapsulation that enables overlay networks to be built in
      virtualized networks.  STT is particularly useful when some tunnel
      endpoints are in end-systems, as it utilizes the capabilities of the
      network interface card to improve performance.

  "CDNI Control Interface / Triggers", Rob Murray, Ben Niven-Jenkins,
  2013-04-03, <draft-murray-cdni-triggers-03.txt>

      This document describes the part of the CDN Interconnect Control
      Interface that allows a CDN to trigger activity in an interconnected
      CDN that is configured to deliver content on its behalf.  The
      upstream CDN can use this mechanism to request that the downstream
      CDN pre-positions metadata or content, or that it re-validate or
      purge metadata or content.  The upstream CDN can monitor the status
      of activity that it has triggered in the downstream CDN.

  "Representing Label Generation Rulesets using XML", Kim Davies, Asmus
  Freytag, 2013-07-09, <draft-davies-idntables-03.txt>

      This memo describes a method of representing the domain name
      registration policy for a zone administrator using Extensible Markup
      Language (XML).  These policies, known as "Label Generation Rulesets"
      (LGRs), are particularly used for the implementation of
      Internationalised Domain Names (IDNs).  The rulesets are used to
      implement and share policy on which specific Unicode codepoints are
      permitted for registrations, which alternative codepoints are
      considered variants, and what actions may be performed on those
      variants.

  "New IP address structure", C.V. Sreeraj, 2013-02-24,

  "Formal Specification Framework for Software-Defined Networks (SDN)",
  Myung-Ki Shin, Ki-Hyuk Nam, Miyoung Kang, Jin-Young Choi, 2013-02-13,
  <draft-shin-sdn-formal-specification-03.txt>

      This document discusses formally verifiable networking framework for
      software-defined networks (SDN). In SDN, incomplete or malicious
      programmable entities could cause break-down of underlying networks
      shared by heterogeneous devices and stake-holders. Formally
      verifiable networking can provide a logic-based framework to unify
      the design, specification, verification, and implementation of SDN.
      This framework describes formal specification and verification
      process for SDN. In addition, we present two examples of formal
      specification for a part of SDN using a process algebra called
      Algebra of Communicating Shard Resources (ACSR) and Z specification
      languages.

      This memo analyzes some port set definition algorithms used for
      stateless IPv4 to IPv6 transition technologies.  The transition
      technologies using port set algorithms can be divided into two
      categories: fully stateless approach and binding approach.  Some
      algorithms can work for both approaches.

  "PMIPv6-based Distributed Mobility Management", Jaehwoon Lee,
  2013-06-11, <draft-jaehwoon-dmm-pmipv6-01.txt>

      Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is the network-based mobility management
      protocol where access network supports the mobility of a mobile node
      on behalf of the MN. In PMIPv6, the location information of the MN
      should be registered to Localized Mobility Anchor and communication
      must be established via the LMA. Therefore, the performance can be
      degraded due to traffic concentration and congestion possibility.
      One method to overcome the above problems is to exploit the
      distributed mobility management (DMM) mechanism to distribute the
      LMA function to all access routers within the PMIPv6 domain. This
      letter proposes the fully distributed mobility management mechanism
      in PMIPv6-based network. In this mechanism, there is no need for
      the location management function to register the location of the MN.
      Therefore, the performance is not degraded due to the overhead to
      query the location of the MN.

  "Scaling the Address Resolution Protocol for Large Data Centers (SARP)",
  Youval Nachum, Linda Dunbar, Ilan Yerushalmi, Tal Mizrahi, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-nachum-sarp-06.txt>

      This document introduces SARP, an architecture that uses proxy
      gateways to scale large data center networks. SARP is based on
      fast proxies that significantly reduce switches' FDB (MAC table)
      sizes and ARP/ND impact on network elements in an environment
      where hosts within one subnet (or VLAN) can spread over various
      locations. SARP is targeted for massive data centers with a
      significant number of VMs that can move across various physical
      locations.

  "Local Prefix Lifetime Management for Proxy Mobile IPv6", Jouni
  Korhonen, Teemu Savolainen, Sri Gundavelli, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-korhonen-dmm-local-prefix-01.txt>

      This specification defines a protocol extension to Proxy Mobile IPv6
      that enables prefix lifetime management for locally assigned prefixes
      within a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  A locally assigned prefix is
      managed by a Mobile Access Gateway and is always topologically
      anchored to the Mobile Access Gateway within the Proxy Mobile IPv6
      domain.

  "STUN Usage for Consent Freshness", Muthu Perumal, Dan Wing, Ram R,
  Tirumaleswar Reddy, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-muthu-behave-consent-freshness-04.txt>

      Verification of peer consent before sending traffic is necessary in
      WebRTC deployments to ensure that a malicious JavaScript cannot use
      the browser as a platform for launching attacks.  A related problem
      is session liveness.  WebRTC application may want to detect
      connection failure and take appropriate action.
      
      This document describes how a WebRTC browser can verify peer consent
      to continue sending traffic and detect connection failure.

  "PMIP Based DMM Approaches", Wen Luo, Juan Liu, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-luo-dmm-pmip-based-dmm-approach-02.txt>

      Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply mobility
      management for mobile nodes (MN).  For supporting Distributed
      Mobility Management based on current PMIP standard, enhanced Proxy
      Mobile IPv6 (ePMIP) with two new logic functions is introduced. (1)
      Location Management Function (LMF), (2) Distributed Anchoring
      Function (DAF), including Distributed Routing sub-Function (DRF) and
      Distributed Mobility sub-Function (DMF).  Basic signalling procedures
      and considerations are also described in this document.

  "Applicability of Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE)", Xian Zhang,
  Ina Minei, 2013-05-25, <draft-zhang-pce-stateful-pce-app-04.txt>

      A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information about
      Label Switched Path (LSP) characteristics and resource usage within a
      network in order to provide traffic engineering calculations for its
      associated Path Computation Clients (PCCs).  This document describes
      general considerations for a stateful PCE deployment and examines its
      applicability and benefits through a number of use cases.  Path
      Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) extensions required for stateful
      PCE usage are covered in separate documents.

  "Multicast transition path optimization in IPv4 and IPv6 networks",
  Qiong Sun, Cathy Zhou, 2013-02-21,
  <draft-zhou-mboned-multrans-path-optimization-03.txt>

      This document describes a mechanism to optimize the path between the
      multicast router and multicast source in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
      The basic idea is that when a multicast translation router has an
      IPv4 path and an IPv6 path to the same multicast data source, and
      both IPv4 and IPv6 joins are received, only one path is used.  One
      path is pruned, instead of the same traffic flowing over both v4 and
      v6 paths.  By adding a metric to the IPv4 path, the multicast
      translation router can determine which path to receive multicast
      data: IPv4 path, IPv6 path or both.  Therefore, an optimization path
      will typically be chosen when an identical v4/v6 traffic flow exists.

  "Analysis of Port Control Protocol in Mobile Network", Gang Chen, Zhen
  Cao, Mohamed Boucadair, Vizdal Ales, Laurent Thiebaut, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-chen-pcp-mobile-deployment-04.txt>

      This memo provides a motivation description for the Port Control
      Protocol (PCP) deployment in a 3GPP mobile network environment.  The
      document focuses on a mobile network specific issues (e.g. cell phone
      battery power consumption, keep-alive traffic reduction), PCP
      applicability to these issues is further studied and analyzed.

  "PMIPv6-based distributed anchoring", Carlos Bernardos, Juan Zuniga,
  2013-04-08, <draft-bernardos-dmm-distributed-anchoring-02.txt>

      Distributed Mobility Management solutions allow for setting up
      networks so that traffic is distributed in an optimal way and does
      not rely on centralized deployed anchors to provide IP mobility
      support.
      
      There are many different approaches to address Distributed Mobility
      Management, as for example extending network-based mobility protocols
      (like Proxy Mobile IPv6), or client-based mobility protocols (as
      Mobile IPv6), among others.  This document follows the former
      approach, and proposes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 in which
      mobility sessions are anchored at the last IP hop router (called
      distributed gateway).  The distributed gateway is an enhanced access
      router which is also able to operate as local mobility anchor or
      mobility access gateway, on a per prefix basis.  The draft focuses on
      the required extensions to effectively support simultaneously
      anchoring several flows at different distributed gateways.
      
      This draft introduces the concept of distributed logical interface
      (at the distributed gateway), which is a software construct that
      allows to easily hide the change of anchor from the mobile node.
      Additionally, the draft describes how to provide session continuity
      in inter-domain scenarios in which dynamic tunneling or signaling
      between distributed gateways from different operators is not allowed.

  "Building power shortest inter-Area TE LSPs using pre-computed paths",
  Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, 2013-05-04,
  <draft-mjsraman-rtgwg-intra-as-psp-te-leak-03.txt>

      In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
      consumption of an Autonomous System (AS) using a collaborative
      approach between areas within an AS. We identify the low-power paths
      within non-backbone areas and then use Traffic Engineering (TE)
      techniques to route the packets along the stitched paths from non-
      backbone areas / backbone area to other non-backbone areas. Such low-
      power paths can be identified by using the power-to-available-
      bandwidth (PWR) ratio as an additional constraint in the Constrained
      Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm. For routing the data traffic
      through these low-power paths, the Inter-Area Traffic Engineered
      Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans multiple areas can be used.
      Extensions to the Interior Gateway Protocols like OSPF and IS-IS that
      support TE extensions can be used to disseminate information about
      low-power paths in the respective areas (backbone or non-backbone)
      that minimize the PWR ratio metric on the links within the areas and
      between the areas thereby creating a collaborative approach to reduce
      the power consumption.
      
      The feasibility of our approaches is illustrated by applying our
      algorithm to an AS with a backbone area and several non-backbone
      areas. The techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-Area power
      reduced paths require a few modifications to the existing features of
      the IGPs supporting TE extensions. The proposed techniques can be
      extended to other levels of Internet hierarchy, such as Inter-AS
      paths, through suitable modifications as in [11].
      
      When link state routing protocols like OSPF or ISIS are used to
      discover TE topology, there is the limitation that traffic engineered
      paths can be set up only when the head and tail end of the label
      switched path are in the same area. There are solutions to overcome
      this limitation either using offline Path Computation Engine (PCE)
      that attach to multiple areas and know the topology of all areas.
      This document proposes an alternative approach that does not require
      any centralized PCE and uses selective leaking of low-power TE path
      information from one area into other areas.

  "More Raw Public Keys for IKEv2", Tero Kivinen, Paul Wouters, Hannes
  Tschofenig, 2013-07-30, <draft-kivinen-ipsecme-oob-pubkey-04.txt>

      The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol currently only
      supports raw RSA keys.  In some environments it is useful to make use
      of other types of public keys, such as those based on Elliptic Curve
      Cryptography.  This documents adds support for other types of raw
      public keys to IKEv2 and obsoletes the old raw RSA key format.

  "Context Transfer for Multicast support in Distributed Mobility
  Management (DMM)", DH, Hitoshi Asaeda, Pierrick Seite, 2013-03-19,
  <draft-vonhugo-multimob-dmm-context-02.txt>

      This document describes a context transfer based concept to support
      overarching IP multicast services applicable to various existing
      approaches for Distributed Mobility Management.

  "Accessing Cloud Services", Yaakov Stein, Yuri Gittik, Daniel Kofman,
  Konstantinos Katsaros, Monique Morrow, Luyuan Fang, Wim Henderickx,
  2013-07-04, <draft-stein-cloud-access-03.txt>

      Cloud services are revolutionizing the way computational resources
      are provided, but at the expense of requiring an even more
      revolutionary overhaul of the networking infrastructure needed to
      deliver them.  Much recent work has focused on intra- and inter-
      datacenter connectivity requirements and architectures, while the
      "access segment" connecting the cloud services user to the datacenter
      still needs to be addressed.  In this draft we consider tighter
      integration between the network and the datacenter, in order to
      improve end-to-end Quality of Experience, while minimizing both
      networking and computational resource costs.

  "An Architecture for Multicast Protection Using Maximally Redundant
  Trees", Alia Atlas, Robert Kebler, IJsbrand Wijnands, Andras Csaszar,
  Gabor Envedi, 2013-07-12, <draft-atlas-rtgwg-mrt-mc-arch-02.txt>

      Failure protection is desirable for multicast traffic, whether
      signaled via PIM or mLDP.  Different mechanisms are suitable for
      different use-cases and deployment scenarios.  This document
      describes the architecture for global protection (aka multicast live-
      live) and for local protection (aka fast-reroute).
      
      The general methods for global protection and local protection using
      alternate-trees are dependent upon the use of Maximally Redundant
      Trees.  Local protection can also tunnel traffic in unicast tunnels
      to take advantage of the routing and fast-reroute mechanisms
      available for IP/LDP unicast destinations.
      
      The failures protected against are single link or node failures.
      While the basic architecture might support protection against shared
      risk group failures, algorithms to dynamically compute MRTs
      supporting this are for future study.

  "CDNI Request Routing: Footprint and Capabilities Semantics", Jan
  Seedorf, Jon Peterson, Stefano Previdi, Ray van Brandenburg, Kevin Ma,
  2013-02-25, <draft-spp-cdni-rr-foot-cap-semantics-04.txt>

      This document tries to capture the semantics of the "Footprint and
      Capabilities Advertisement" part of the CDNI Request Routing
      interface, i.e. the desired meaning and what "Footprint and
      Capabilities Advertisement" is expected to offer within CDNI.  The
      discussion in this document has the goal to facilitate the choosing
      of one or more suitable protocols for "Footprint and Capabilities
      Advertisement" within CDNI Request Routing.

  "Receiver-Driven Multicast Traffic-Engineered Label-Switched Paths",
  Renwei Li, Quintin Zhao, Christian Jacquenet, Eduard Metz, Telus
  Communications, 2013-06-30,
  <draft-lzj-mpls-receiver-driven-multicast-rsvp-te-03.txt>

      This document describes extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol -
      Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for the setup of Receiver-Driven
      Traffic-Engineered point-to-multipoint (P2MP) and multipoint-to-
      multipoint (MP2MP)Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multi-Protocol Label
      Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)networks.

  "The Applicability of the PCE to Computing Protection and Recovery Paths
  for Single Domain and Multi-Domain Networks.", Huaimo Chen, Dhruv Dhody,
  2013-04-29, <draft-chen-pce-protection-applicability-03.txt>

      The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation
      functions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label
      Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.
      
      A link or node failure can significantly impact network services in
      large-scale networks.  Therefore it is important to ensure the
      survivability of large scale networks which consist of various
      connections provided over multiple interconnected networks with
      varying technologies.
      
      This document examines the applicability of the PCE architecture,
      protocols, and procedures for computing protection paths and
      restoration services, for single and multi-domain networks.
      
      This document also explains the mechanism of Fast Re-Route (FRR)
      where a point of local repair (PLR) needs to find the appropriate
      merge point (MP) to do bypass path computation using PCE.

  "RSVP Setup Protection", Yimin Shen, Yuji Kamite, Eric Osborne,
  2013-06-28, <draft-shen-mpls-rsvp-setup-protection-03.txt>

      RFC 4090 specifies an RSVP facility-backup fast reroute mechanism for
      protecting LSPs against link and node failures.  This document
      extends the mechanism to provide so-called "setup protection" for
      LSPs during their initial Path message signaling time.  In
      particular, it enables a router to reroute an LSP via an existing
      bypass LSP, when there is a failure of the immediate downstream link
      or node along the desired path.  Therefore, it can be used to avoid
      LSP signaling failure and reduce setup time in such kind of
      situation, and allow an LSP to be established temporarily over a
      bypass LSP when an alternative path can only be resolved at a much
      later time.

  "Deployment Considerations for Lightweight 4over6", Qiong Sun, Chongfeng
  Xie, Yiu Lee, Maoke Chen, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-sun-softwire-lightweigh-4over6-deployment-04.txt>

      Lightweight 4over6 is a mechanism which moves the translation
      function from tunnel lwAFTR (AFTR) to lwB4s (B4s), and hence reduces
      the mapping scale on the lwAFTR to per-customer level.  This document
      discusses various deployment models of Lightweight 4over6.  It also
      describes the deployment considerations and applicability of the
      Lightweight 4over6 architecture.

  "Path Computation Element (PCE) Database Requirements", Olivier Dugeon,
  Julien Meuric, Richard Douville, Ramon Casellas, Oscar de Dios,
  2013-07-15, <draft-dugeon-pce-ted-reqs-02.txt>

      The Path Computation Element (PCE) working group (WG) has produced a
      set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path Computation
      Element as a tool to help MPLS-TE and GMPLS LSP tunnels placement.
      In the PCE architecture, a main assumption has been done concerning
      the information that the PCE needs to perform its computation.  In a
      fist approach, the PCE embeds a Traffic Engineering Database (TED)
      containing all pertinent and suitable information regarding the
      network that is in the scope of a PCE.  Nevertheless, the TED
      requirements as well as the TED information have not yet been
      formalized.  In addition, some recent RFC (like the Backward
      Recursive Path Computation procedure or PCE Hierarchy) or WG draft
      (like draft-ietf-pce-stateful-pce ...) suffer from a lack of
      information in the TED, leading to a non optimal result or to some
      difficulties to deploy them.  This memo tries to identify some
      Database, at large, requirements for the PCE.  It is split in two
      main sections: the identification of the specific information to be
      stored in the PCE Database and how it may be populated.

  "Mobility API Extension for Distributed Mobility Management", Dapeng
  Liu, Hui Deng, 2013-07-07, <draft-liu-dmm-mobility-api-01.txt>

      [RFC5014] specifies extension to socket API to allow application to
      specify the preference among multiple source addresses.
      [I-D.draft-korhonen-6man-prfix-properties] and
      [I-D.draft-bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix-04] propose to extend
      router advertisment to carry the prefix property and class
      information.  The mobile node can learn the prefix property and class
      information from the router advertisment message.  This document
      proposes an extension to [RFC5014] to enable the application to
      select the distributed mobility management related prefixes.

  "Requirements for Message Access Control", Trevor Freeman, Jim Schaad,
  Patrick Patterson, 2013-06-12,
  <draft-freeman-plasma-requirements-06.txt>

      There are many situations where organizations want to protect
      information with robust access control, either for implementation of
      intellectual property right protections, enforcement of contractual
      confidentiality agreements or because of legal regulations.  The
      Enhanced Security Services (ESS) for S/MIME defines an access control
      mechanism for email which is enforced by the recipient's client after
      decryption of the message. The ESS mechanism therefore is dependent
      on the correct access policy configuration of every recipient's
      client. This mechanism also provides full access to the data to all
      recipients prior to the access control check, this is considered to
      be inadequate due to the difficulty in demonstrating policy
      compliance.
      
      This document lays out the deficiencies of the current ESS security
      label, and presents requirements for a new model for providing access
      control to messages where the access check is performed prior to
      message content decryption. This new model also does not require
      policy configuration on the client to simplify deployment and
      compliance verification.
      
      The proposed model additionally provides a method where non-X.509
      certificate credentials can be used for encryption/decryption of
      S/MIME messages.

  "Diameter AVP Level Security: Keyed Message Digests, Digital Signatures,
  and Encryption", Jouni Korhonen, Hannes Tschofenig, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-korhonen-dime-e2e-security-02.txt>

      This document defines an extension for end to end authentication,
      integrity and confidentiality protection of Diameter Attribute Value
      Pairs.  The solutions focuses on protecting Diameter Attribute Value
      Pairs and leaves the key distribution solution to a separate
      specification.  The integrity protection can be introduced in a
      backward compatible manner to existing application.  The
      confidentiality protection requires an explicit support from an
      application, thus is applicable only for newly defined applications.

  "CUSAX: Combined Use of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
  Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)", Emil Ivov, Peter
  Saint-Andre, Enrico Marocco, 2013-06-05, <draft-ivov-xmpp-cusax-06.txt>

      This document describes suggested practices for combined use of the
      Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and
      Presence Protocol (XMPP).  Such practices aim to provide a single
      fully featured real-time communication service by using complementary
      subsets of features from each of the protocols.  Typically such
      subsets would include telephony capabilities from SIP and instant
      messaging and presence capabilities from XMPP.  This specification
      does not define any new protocols or syntax for either SIP or XMPP.
      However, implementing the practices outlined in this document may
      require modifying or at least reconfiguring existing client and
      server-side software.  Also, it is not the purpose of this document
      to make recommendations as to whether or not such combined use should
      be preferred to the mechanisms provided natively by each protocol
      (for example, SIP's SIMPLE or XMPP's Jingle).  It merely aims to
      provide guidance to those who are interested in such a combined use.

  "A Framework and Information Model for Queries about Telephone-Related
  Queries (TeRQ)", Jon Peterson, 2013-02-25, <draft-peterson-terq-03.txt>

      As telephone services migrate to the Internet, Internet applications
      require access to diverse information about telephone numbers.  ENUM,
      for example, applied the DNS to the problem of finding URIs for
      telephone services on the Internet.  The intrinsic limitations in the
      query/response semantics of the DNS, however, have often been
      strained by the requirements for accessing information about
      telephone numbers.  This document therefore proposes a protocol-
      independent framework and information model for querying and
      responding to requests concerning telephone numbers and call routing
      that allows a richer expression of both questions and answers.

  "Include Routes - Extension to Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic
  Engineering (RSVP-TE)", Zafar Ali, George Swallow, Clarence Filsfils,
  Matt Hartley, Ori Gerstel, Kenji Kumaki, Ruediger Kunze, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ali-ccamp-rsvp-te-include-route-04.txt>

      There are scenarios that require two or more LSPs or segments of
      LSPs to follow same route in the network. This document specifies
      methods to communicate route inclusions along the loose hops during
      path setup using the Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic
      Engineering (RSVP-TE) protocol.

  "Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) extension
  for signaling Objective Function and Metric Bound", Zafar Ali, George
  Swallow, Clarence Filsfils, Luyuan Fang, Kenji Kumaki, Ruediger Kunze,
  Daniele Ceccarelli, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ali-ccamp-rc-objective-function-metric-bound-03.txt>

      In particular networks such as those used by financial
      institutions, network performance criteria such as latency are
      becoming as critical to data path selection.  However cost is still
      an important consideration.  This leads to a situation where path
      calculation involves multiple metrics and more complex objective
      functions.
      
      When using GMPLS control plane, there are many scenarios in which a
      node may need to request a remote node to perform path computation
      or expansion, like for example multi-domain LSP setup, Generalized
      Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User-Network Interface (UNI)
      or simply the utilization of a loose ERO in intra domain signaling.
      In such cases, the node requesting for the setup of an LSP needs to
      convey the required objective function to the remote node, to
      enable it to perform route computation in the desired fashion.
      Similarly, there are cases the ingress needs to indicate a TE
      metric bound for a loose segment that is expanded by a remote node.
      
      This document defines extensions to the RSVP-TE Protocol to allow
      an ingress node to request the required objective function for the
      route computation, as well as a metric bound to influence route
      computation decisions at a remote node(s).

  "WebRTC Data Channel Protocol", Randell Jesup, Salvatore Loreto, Michael
  Tuexen, 2013-02-26, <draft-jesup-rtcweb-data-protocol-04.txt>

      The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) working group is charged to
      provide protocols to support for direct interactive rich
      communication using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-
      browsers.  This document specifies an actual (minor) protocol for how
      the JS-layer DataChannel objects provide the data channels between
      the peers.

  "Service Distribution using OSPF", Padma Pillay-Esnault, Burjiz
  Pithawala, Derek Yeung, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-pillay-esnault-ospf-service-distribution-02.txt>

      The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol is used to carry data on
      behalf of other services using the Opaque Link State Advertisements.
      The protocol's flooding mechanism is well suited to cover the data
      propagation requirements of services such as Traffic Engineering.
      The current mechanism cannot scale for a large number of services nor
      satisfy some of their new set of requirements.  This document
      describes a new mechanism in OSPF to support service and data
      distribution for a large number of services, computation of preferred
      service access points and a controlled service data exchange.

  "Service Provider Wi-Fi Services Over Residential Architectures", Sri
  Gundavelli, Mark Grayson, Pierrick Seite, Yiu Lee, 2013-04-23,
  <draft-gundavelli-v6ops-community-wifi-svcs-06.txt>

      The tremendous growth in Wi-Fi technology adoption over the last
      decade has met the ultimate possible goal of 100% adoption rate.  All
      most every new mobile device is now equipped with IEEE 802.11-based
      wireless interface and with pre-configured policy to prefer Wi-Fi to
      cellular access.  Matching this evolution is every service provider's
      desire to offer Wi-Fi based broadband services; a new business
      opportunity even for fixed line operators.  Operators are exploring
      options to monetize their existing networks, most with nation-wide
      footprint, to build a high-speed Wi-Fi service that can be the basis
      for offering new wireless broadband services.  This document
      identifies the requirements for supporting these new Wi-Fi community
      services and the mobility tools which have been standardized in IETF
      that can be used for enabling these architectures.

  "NAT traversal for LISP", Vina Ermagan, Dino Farinacci, Darrel Lewis,
  Jesper Skriver, Fabio Maino, Chris White, 2013-03-29,
  <draft-ermagan-lisp-nat-traversal-03.txt>

      This document describes a mechanism for IPv4 NAT traversal for LISP
      tunnel routers (xTR) and LISP Mobile Nodes (LISP-MN) behind a NAT
      device.  A LISP device both detects the NAT and initializes its
      state.  Forwarding to the LISP device through a NAT is enabled by a
      new network element, the LISP Re-encapsulating Tunnel Router (RTR),
      which acts as an anchor point in the data plane, forwarding traffic
      from unmodified LISP devices through the NAT.

  "Standard Configuration of DiffServ Service Classes", James Polk,
  2013-03-05, <draft-polk-tsvwg-rfc4594-update-03.txt>

      This document describes service classes configured with DiffServ and
      identifies how they are used and how to construct them using 
      Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), traffic conditioners, 
      Per-Hop Behaviors (PHBs), and Active Queue Management (AQM) 
      mechanisms.  There is no intrinsic requirement that particular 
      DSCPs, traffic conditioners, PHBs, and AQM be used for a certain 
      service class, but for consistent behavior under the same network 
      conditions, configuring networks as described here is appropriate.

  "New Differentiated Services Code Point Assignments for Rich Media
  Traffic", James Polk, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-polk-tsvwg-new-dscp-assignments-02.txt>

      This document requests five new Differentiated Services Code Point
      (DSCP) values (DSCP) from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
      (IANA) for new classes of rich media traffic and one additional DSCP
      value for the signaling of multimedia sessions.

  "IPv6 Operational Guidelines for Datacenters", Diego Lopez, Zhonghua
  Chen, Tina Tsou, Cathy Zhou, Arturo Servin, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-lopez-v6ops-dc-ipv6-05.txt>

      This document is intended to provide operational guidelines for
      datacenter operators planning to deploy IPv6 in their
      infrastructures.  It aims to offer a reference framework for
      evaluating different products and architectures, and therefore it is
      also addressed to manufacturers and solution providers, so they can
      use it to gauge their solutions.  We believe this will translate in a
      smoother and faster IPv6 transition for datacenters of these
      infrastuctures.
      
      The document focuses on the DC infrastructure itself, its operation,
      and the aspects related to DC interconnection through IPv6.  It does
      not consider the particular mechanisms for making Internet services
      provided by applications hosted in the DC available through IPv6
      beyond the specific aspects related to how their deployment on the
      Data Center (DC) infrastructure.
      
      Apart from facilitating the transition to IPv6, the mechanisms
      outlined here are intended to make this transition as transparent as
      possible (if not completely transparent) to applications and services
      running on the DC infrastructure, as well as to take advantage of
      IPv6 features to simplify DC operations, internally and across the

  "ALTO session for CDN Interconnection", Stephan Emile, Selim Ellouze,
  2013-04-16, <draft-stephan-cdni-alto-session-ext-03.txt>

      The selection of a downstream CDN by an upstream CDN is based on
      multi-dimensional criteria.  Various protocols, such as BGP or ALTO,
      may be used by a downstream CDN to expose content routing information
      and interconnection preferences to an upstream CDN.  The selection of
      such a protocol is premature as the WG, and especially the Footprint/
      Capabilities Design Team, is currently working on this topic.  So
      this draft does not promote the usage of the ALTO protocol for CDN
      interconnection.  It presents the limitations of the current ALTO
      protocol in the case it would be selected for CDN interconnection.
      It specifies the mechanism for controlling the session initialization
      and for limiting the information exchanged.  Then it discusses the
      need of incremental update and proposes to study the usage of Netconf
      /Yang to provide ALTO server with notifications.

  "DS-Lite Failure Detection and Failover", Tina Tsou, Brandon Li, Cathy
  Zhou, Jürgen Schönwälder, Reinaldo Penno, Mohamed Boucadair, 2013-06-16,
  <draft-tsou-softwire-bfd-ds-lite-05.txt>

      In DS-Lite, the tunnel is stateless, not associated with any state
      information, and the CGN function at the AFTR is stateful.
      Currently, there is no failure detection and failover mechanism for
      both stateless tunnel and stateful CGN function, which makes it
      difficult to manage and diagnose if there is a problem.  This draft
      analyzes the applicability of some of the possible solutions.

  Gustavo Lozano, Shoji Noguchi, James Gould, Chethan Thippeswamy,
  2013-07-31, <draft-arias-noguchi-dnrd-objects-mapping-04.txt>

      This document specifies the format, contents and semantics of Domain

      Registry.

  "Trust Requirements in a Federated World", Josh Howlett, Rhys Smith,
  Margaret Wasserman, 2013-03-11,
  <draft-howlett-abfab-trust-router-ps-03.txt>

      TODO: This document outlines the requirements for trust in a
      federated environment, and enumerates the requirements for a trust
      infrastructure.  It also examines existing trust infrastructures
      given these requirements and concludes that none fulfil all of the
      requirements, and suggests that maybe a new one is required that
      does.

  "TRILL: Directory Assistance Mechanisms", Linda Dunbar, Donald Eastlake,
  Radia Perlman, Igor Gashinsky, Li Yizhou, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-dunbar-trill-scheme-for-directory-assist-05.txt>

      This document describes mechanisms for using directory server(s) to
      assist TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) edge
      switches in reducing multi-destination traffic, particularly ARP/ND
      and unknown unicast flooding.

  "TFTP Windowsize Option", Patrick Masotta, 2013-05-15,
  <draft-masotta-tftpexts-windowsize-opt-07.txt>

      The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, file
      transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a
      remote host.  One of its primary uses is the early stages of nodes 
      booting from a Local Area Network. TFTP has been always used because
      it is very simple to implement. However, the choice of a lock-step
      schema is not the most efficient for use on a LAN.
      
      This document describes a TFTP option which allows the client and
      server to negotiate a windowsize of consecutive blocks to send 
      as an alternative for replacing the single block lock-step schema. 
      The TFTP Option Extension mechanism is described in [2].

  "Plasma Service Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Processing", Jim
  Schaad, 2013-03-18, <draft-schaad-plasma-cms-04.txt>

      Secure MIME (S/MIME) defined a method of placing security labels on a
      Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) object.  These labels are placed
      as part of the data signed and validated by the parties.  This means
      that the message content is visible to the recipient prior to the
      label enforcement.  A new model for enforcement of policy using a
      third party is described in RFC TBD
      [I.D-draft-freeman-plasma-requirements].  This is the Policy
      Augmented S/MIME (PLASMA) system.  This document provides the details
      needed to implement the new Plasma model in the CMS infrastructure.
      
      An additional benefit of using the Plasma module is that the server,
      based on policy, manages who has access to the message and how the
      keys are protected.
      
      The document details how the client encryption and decryption
      processes are performed, defines how to construct the CMS recipient
      info structure, a new content to hold the data required for the
      Plasma server to store the keys and policy information.  The document
      does not cover the protocol between the client and the Plasma policy
      enforcement server.  One example of the client/server protocol can be
      found in RFC TBD [plasma-token].

  "LISP Traffic Engineering Use-Cases", Dino Farinacci, Parantap Lahiri,
  Michael Kowal, 2013-07-11, <draft-farinacci-lisp-te-03.txt>

      This document describes how LISP reencapsulating tunnels can be used
      for Traffic Engineering purposes.  The mechanisms described in this
      document require no LISP protocol changes but do introduce a new
      locator (RLOC) encoding.  The Traffic Engineering features provided
      by these LISP mechanisms can span intra-domain, inter-domain, or
      combination of both.

  "Securing Model-C Inter-Provider VPNs with Label Hopping and TicToc",
  Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, 2013-04-08,
  <draft-mjsraman-l3vpn-tictoc-label-hop-03.txt>

      In certain models of inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label Switching
      (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) spoofing attack against
      VPN sites is a key concern. For example, MPLS-based VPN inter-
      provider model "C" is not favoured, owing to security concerns in the
      dataplane, even though it can scale with respect to maintenance of
      routing state. Since the inner labels associated with VPN sites are
      not encrypted during transmission, a man-in-themiddle attacker can
      spoof packets to a specific VPN site. In this paper, we propose a
      label-hopping technique which uses a set of randomized labels and a
      method for hopping amongst these labels using the time instant the
      packet leaves the port from a sending Provider Edge Router. To
      prevent the attacker from identifying the labels in polynomial time,
      we also use an additional label. The proposed technique can be
      applied to other variants of inter-provider MPLS based VPNs where
      Multi-Protocol exterior-BGP (MP-eBGP) multi-hop is used. As we
      address a key security concern, we can make a case for the deployment
      of MPLS based VPN inter-provider model "C". Specifically we use the
      TicToc based Precision Time Protocol LSP to provide the timing for
      determining the time instant at which the packet is sent from the
      remote end Provider Edge Router and hence calculating when it must
      have left that peer at the Provider Edge Router in the near /
      receiving end.
      
      This version of the document suggests a better method for gaining
      more finely granular time slices. This is done by running the PTP LSP
      between the ASBRs in the ASes that are providing the inter-AS L3VPN
      service.

  "Power Based Topologies and TE-Shortest Power Paths in OSPF", Shankar
  Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Vasan Srini, 2013-04-27,
  <draft-mjsraman-rtgwg-ospf-power-topo-02.txt>

      In a Interior Gateway Protocol like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
      the computation of the Constrained shortest path to destinations is
      computed for an area say a backbone or a non-backbone area using the
      TE-metrics advertised in the area. With importance given to the
      reduction of power within a network it becomes important to provide a
      solution that reduces the power consumed amongst routers and links
      that make up the network (in this case an area or a collection of
      areas including the backbone and non-backbone areas). This proposal
      aims at providing such a solution by producing a power topology of
      the area / areas. This power topology is constructed by assigning
      metrics to links based on the power consumed by the linecards (and
      hence their respective ports in an indirect way) of adjacent routers
      that are interconnected by each such link.

  "Definition and Use of DNSSEC Negative Trust Anchors", Jason Livingood,
  Chris Griffiths, 2013-02-22,
  <draft-livingood-negative-trust-anchors-06.txt>

      DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is now entering widespread
      deployment.  However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet
      as mature and reliable as is the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain
      administration tools and processes.  One potential technique to
      mitigate this is to use a Negative Trust Anchor, which is defined in
      this document.
      
      This document discusses Trust Anchors for DNSSEC and defines a
      Negative Trust Anchor, which is potentially useful during the
      transition to ubiquitous DNSSEC deployment.  These are configured
      locally on a particular instance of a validating DNS recursive
      resolver and can shield end users of such a resolver from the DNSSEC-
      related authoritative name server operational errors that appear to
      be somewhat typical during the transition to ubiquitous DNSSEC
      deployment.  Negative Trust Anchors are intended to be temporary, and
      should not be distributed by IANA or any other organization outside
      of the administrative boundary of the organization locally
      implementing a Negative Trust Anchor.  Finally, Negative Trust
      Anchors pertain only to DNSSEC and not to Public Key Infrastructures
      (PKI) such ad X.509.

  "CoRE Roadmap and Implementation Guide", Carsten Bormann, 2013-05-01,
  <draft-bormann-core-roadmap-04.txt>

      The CoRE set of protocols, in particular the CoAP protocol, is
      defined in draft-ietf-core-coap in conjunction with a number of
      specifications that are currently nearing completion.  There are also
      several dozen more individual Internet-Drafts in various states of
      development, with various levels of WG review and interest.
      
      Today, this is simply a bewildering array of documents.  Beyond the
      main four documents, it is hard to find relevant information and
      assess the status of proposals.  At the level of Internet-Drafts, the
      IETF has only adoption as a WG document to assign status - too crude
      an instrument to assess the level of development and standing for
      anyone who does not follow the daily proceedings of the WG.
      
      With a more long-term perspective, as additional drafts mature and
      existing specifications enter various levels of spec maintenance, the
      entirety of these specifications may become harder to understand,
      pose specific implementation problems, or be simply inconsistent.
      
      The present guide aims to provide a roadmap to these documents as
      well as provide specific advice how to use these specifications in
      combination.  In certain cases, it may provide clarifications or even
      corrections to the specifications referenced.
      
      This guide is intended as a continued work-in-progress, i.e.  a long-
      lived Internet-Draft, to be updated whenever new information becomes
      available and new consensus on how to handle issues is formed.
      Similar to the ROHC implementation guide, RFC 4815, it might be
      published as an RFC at some future time later in the acceptance curve
      of the specifications.
      
      This document does not describe a new protocol or attempt to set a
      new standard of any kind - it mostly describes good practice in using
      the existing specifications, but it may also document emerging
      consensus where a correction needs to be made.

  "Reducing Power Consumption using BGP path selection", Shankar Raman,
  Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Vasan Srini, 2013-04-27,
  <draft-mjsraman-rtgwg-bgp-power-path-04.txt>

      In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
      consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between
      Autonomous Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS
      and then use suitable modifications to the BGP path selection
      algorithm to route the packets along the paths. Such low-power paths
      can be identified by using the consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth
      (PWR) ratio as an additional parameter in the BGP Path Selection
      Algorithm. For re-routing the data traffic through these low-power
      paths, the power based best path is selected and advertised as per
      the modified algorithm proposed in this document. Extensions to the
      Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) can be used to disseminate the PWR
      ratio metric among the AS thereby creating a collaborative approach
      to reduce the power consumption. The feasibility of our approaches is
      illustrated by applying our algorithm to a subset of the Internet.
      The techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-AS power
      reduction require minimal modifications to the existing features of
      the Internet. The proposed techniques can be extended to other levels
      of Internet hierarchy, such as Intra-AS paths, through suitable
      modifications. A recent addition is the use of this method in AIGP
      domains and also the use of power source data in the calculation of
      low power paths using the BGP path selection algorithm.

  "LLN Fragment Forwarding and Recovery", Pascal Thubert, Jonathan Hui,
  2013-02-25, <draft-thubert-roll-forwarding-frags-01.txt>

      In order to be routed, a fragmented packet must be reassembled at
      every hop of a multihop link where lower layer fragmentation occurs.
      Considering that the IPv6 minimum MTU is 1280 bytes and that an an
      802.15.4 frame can have a payload limited to 74 bytes in the worst
      case, a packet might end up fragmented into as many as 18 fragments
      at the 6LoWPAN shim layer.  If a single one of those fragments is
      lost in transmission, all fragments must be resent, further
      contributing to the congestion that might have caused the initial
      packet loss.  This draft introduces a simple protocol to forward and
      recover individual fragments that might be lost over multiple hops
      between 6LoWPAN endpoints.

  "Fundamental Architecture of Services Provider's network Transitioning
  to IPv6 (FAST6)", GuoLiang Yang, Yangchun Li, Cancan Huang, Jinhua Tan,
  Youming Wu, 2013-04-01, <draft-yang-v6ops-fast6-02.txt>

      The IANA free pool of IPv4 addresses was depleted, IPv6 migration has
      become the most imperative task.  There are many transition
      mechanisms designed for different scenarios, however, some problems
      arosed in the practice.  FAST6, specified in this draft, is based on
      the ideas of native dual stack and address sharing.  It can solves
      the mixed route problem and simplify the planning of private IPv4
      address space by using tunnel technology.  FAST6 is an economical and
      stable technology for smooth network transition.

  "An M-party, N-state Game of Rochambeau", Dan Harkins, Paul Lambert,
  2013-04-01, <draft-harkins-rochambeau-02.txt>

      A protocol for the fair selection and random distribution of a single
      winner in a game with an arbitrary number of players is described.

  "File Transfer Protocol HASH Command for Cryptographic Hashes", Anthony
  Bryan, Tim Kosse, Daniel Stenberg, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-bryan-ftpext-hash-02.txt>

      The File Transfer Protocol does not offer any method to verify the
      integrity of a transferred file, nor can two files be compared
      against each other without actually transferring them first.
      Cryptographic hashes are a possible solution to this problem.  In the
      past, several attempts have been made to add commands to obtain
      checksums and hashes, however none have been formally specified,
      leading to non-interoperability and confusion.  To solve these
      issues, this document specifies a new FTP command to be used by
      clients to request cryptographic hashes of files.

  "vCard representation of resources", Ciny Joy, Cyrus Daboo, Mike

  Michal Kutzner, Adrian Dymek, Szymon Kwiatkowski, Marcin Langa,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ruminski-homenet-galop-proto-07.txt>

      This informational memo specifies a Grazed and Lightweight Open
      Protocol (GaLOP), designed to exchange information within the
      Hackney project [HACKNEY]. The document describes messages'
      structures, defined message types used in the communication and
      standard connection scenarios.

  "Re-ECN: Adding Accountability for Causing Congestion to TCP/IP", Bob
  Briscoe, Arnaud Jacquet, Toby Moncaster, Alan Smith, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-briscoe-conex-re-ecn-tcp-02.txt>

      This document introduces re-ECN (re-inserted explicit congestion
      notification), which is intended to make a simple but far-reaching
      change to the Internet architecture.  The sender uses the IP header
      to reveal the congestion that it expects on the end-to-end path.  The
      protocol works by arranging an extended ECN field in each packet so
      that, as it crosses any interface in an internetwork, it will carry a
      truthful prediction of congestion on the remainder of its path.  It
      can be deployed incrementally around unmodified routers.  The purpose
      of this document is to specify the re-ECN protocol at the IP layer
      and to give guidelines on any consequent changes required to
      transport protocols.  It includes the changes required to TCP both as
      an example and as a specification.  It briefly gives examples of
      mechanisms that can use the protocol to ensure data sources respond
      sufficiently to congestion, but these are described more fully in a
      companion document.
      
      Note concerning Intended Status: If this draft were ever published as
      an RFC it would probably have historic status.  There is limited
      space in the IP header, so re-ECN had to compromise by requiring the
      receiver to be ECN-enabled otherwise the sender could not use re-ECN.
      Re-ECN was a precursor to chartering of the IETF's Congestion
      Exposure (ConEx) working group, but during chartering there were
      still too few ECN receivers enabled, therefore it was decided to
      pursue other compromises in order to fit a similar capability into
      the IP header.

  "Re-ECN: A Framework for adding Congestion Accountability to TCP/IP",
  Bob Briscoe, Arnaud Jacquet, Toby Moncaster, Alan Smith, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-briscoe-conex-re-ecn-motiv-02.txt>

      This document describes a framework for using a new protocol called
      re-ECN (re-inserted explicit congestion notification), which can be
      deployed incrementally around unmodified routers.  Re-ECN allows
      accurate congestion monitoring throughout the network thus enabling
      the upstream party at any trust boundary in the internetwork to be
      held responsible for the congestion they cause, or allow to be
      caused.  So, networks can introduce straightforward accountability
      for congestion and policing mechanisms for incoming traffic from end-
      customers or from neighbouring network domains.  As well as giving
      the motivation for re-ECN this document also gives examples of
      mechanisms that can use the protocol to ensure data sources respond
      correctly to congestion.  And it describes example mechanisms that
      ensure the dominant selfish strategy of both network domains and end-
      points will be to use the protocol honestly.
      
      Note concerning Intended Status: If this draft were ever published as
      an RFC it would probably have historic status.  There is limited
      space in the IP header, so re-ECN had to compromise by requiring the
      receiver to be ECN-enabled otherwise the sender could not use re-ECN.
      Re-ECN was a precursor to chartering of the IETF's Congestion
      Exposure (ConEx) working group, but during chartering there were
      still too few ECN receivers enabled, therefore it was decided to
      pursue other compromises in order to fit a similar capability into
      the IP header.

  "IPv6 RA Options for Multiple Interface Next Hop Routes", Behcet
  Sarikaya, 2013-02-25, <draft-sarikaya-mif-6man-ra-route-02.txt>

      This draft defines new Router Advertisement options for configuring
      next hop routes on the mobile or fixed nodes.  Using these options,
      an operator can easily configure nodes with multiple interfaces (or
      otherwise multi-homed) to enable them to select the routes to a
      destination.  Each option is defined together with definitions of
      host and router behaviors.

  "Adaptation Layer Fragmentation Indication", Carsten Bormann,
  2013-03-10, <draft-bormann-intarea-alfi-03.txt>

      IPv6 defines a minimum MTU of 1280 bytes.  Many link layers are more
      limited in the maximum size of packets they can communicate.  In
      order to enable the transport of IP packets that are too large for
      these link layers, typically their IP adaptation layers define a
      segmentation or fragmentation scheme to transport an IP packet in a
      sequence of multiple link layer packets.
      
      Often, adaption layer fragmentation schemes reduce some performance
      metric, such as the packet delivery probability.  Application or
      transport protocols may be able to reduce the maximum size of packets
      they send, e.g.  by transport layer segmentation or choice of
      application layer data object size, which may have less of a
      performance impact.  It would therefore be desirable for them to know
      about any adaptation layer fragmentation that is going on, so they
      can choose packet sizes that minimize adaptation layer fragmentation.
      
      At the IP layer, fragmentation can be detected using a number of
      mechanisms used in Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery [RFC4821].
      However, adaptation layer fragmentation schemes are often designed to
      be "transparent", i.e.  there is no way at higher layers to find out
      whether they had to be employed (except maybe by elaborate
      measurement schemes targeting one of the impacted performance
      metrics; this approach does not appear to be viable) [WEI].
      
      The present specification defines a mechanism for IPv6 adaptation
      layers to indicate the presence of adaptation layer fragmentation on
      one or more hops on the path from an IP sender to an IP receiver, and
      to provide an indication of preferred (smaller) packet sizes on these
      hops.
      
      The main objective of this version of the draft is to present a
      complete design in order to be able to gauge the complexity of the
      approach against the gains to be expected from implementing it.
      
      Comments are appreciated and should go to the intarea@ietf.org

  "Supercharged Codes", Erik Stauffer, BZ Shen, Soumen Chakraborty,
  Djordje Tujkovic, Jing Huang, Shiv Shet, Kamlesh Rath, 2013-03-29,
  <draft-stauffer-rmt-bb-fec-supercharged-02.txt>

      This document describes a fully-specified FEC scheme for the
      Supercharged forward error correction code.  Supercharged codes are
      designed for use on the erasure channel.  Coding for the erasure
      channel commonly arises for data transmission over the internet, where
      lower layers either successfully deliver packets or fail to deliver
      them.  Coding is required to insure that data is not lost, even if
      packets are lost at the lower layers.  Error free reception is
      important for multimedia applications, such as streaming, where it may
      not be possible to correct an error in time by any other means.  Coding
      insures that lost packets can be recovered.

  "Operational Considerations for Tunnel Fragmentation and Reassembly",
  Fred Templin, 2013-03-27, <draft-generic-v6ops-tunmtu-13.txt>

      The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for popular IP-in-IP tunnels is
      currently recommended to be set to 1500 (or less) minus the length of
      the encapsulation headers when static MTU determination is used.
      This requires the tunnel ingress to either fragment any IP packet
      larger than the MTU or drop the packet and return an ICMP Packet Too
      Big (PTB) message.  Concerns for operational issues with Path MTU
      Discovery (PMTUD) point to the possibility of MTU-related black holes
      when a packet is dropped due to an MTU restriction.  The current
      "Internet cell size" is effectively 1500 bytes (i.e., the minimum MTU
      configured by the vast majority of links in the Internet) and should
      therefore also be the minimum MTU assigned to tunnels, but this has
      proven to be problematic in common operational practice.  This
      document therefore discusses operational considerations for tunnel
      fragmentation and reassembly necessary to accommodate this Internet
      cell size.

  "BGP Remote-Next-Hop", Gunter Van de Velde, Keyur Patel, Dhananjaya Rao,
  Robert Raszuk, Randy Bush, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-vandevelde-idr-remote-next-hop-04.txt>

      The BGP Remote-Next-Hop is a new optional transitive attribute
      intended to facilitate automatic tunneling across an AS on a per
      address family basis.  The attribute carries one or more tunnel end-
      points for a NLRI.  Additionally, tunnel encapsulation information is
      communicated to successfully setup these tunnels.

  "Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) OpenFlow Model
  Library", Evangelos Haleplidis, Omar Cherkaoui, Susan Hares, Weiming
  Wang, 2013-04-25, <draft-haleplidis-forces-openflow-lib-03.txt>

      This document describes the OpenFlow switch in Logical Function
      Blocks (LFBs) used in the Forwarding and Control Element Separation
      (ForCES).  The LFB classes are defined according to the ForCES
      Forwading Element (FE) model and ForCES protocol specifications.  The
      library includes the descriptions of the OpenFlow LFBs and the XML
      definitions.

  "Conference Focus Indicating CCMP Support", Rifaat Shekh-Yusef, Mary
  Barnes, 2013-05-10, <draft-yusef-dispatch-ccmp-indication-04.txt>

      The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol document defines a
      way for a client to discover a conference control server that
      supports CCMP. However, it does not define a way for a client
      involved in a conference to determine if the conference focus
      supports CCMP. This information would allow a CCMP-enabled client
      that joins a conference using SIP to also register for the XCON
      conference event package RFC 4575 [RFC4575] and take advantage of
      CCMP operations on the conference.
      
      This document describes a few options to address the above limitation
      with the pros and cons for each approach, and recommends two to be
      used depending on the need of the UA. The first approach uses the
      Call-Info header and as a result this document updates RFC 3261
      [RFC3261]. The second approach defines a new value for the 'purpose'
      parameter in the 'service-uris' element in the SIP conferencing event
      package, and as a result this document updates RFC 4575 [RFC4575].

  "ICTP - Information Centric Transport Protocol for CONET ICN", Stefano
  Salsano, Andrea Detti, Nicola Blefari-Melazzi, Matteo Cancellieri,
  2013-06-20, <draft-salsano-ictp-02.txt>

      Let us consider an Information Centric Networking (ICN) solution, in
      which an End Node requests for a content sending "content requests"
      (or "interest packets").  The content is provided back to the
      requestor by the "origin" node or by an intermediate node that had
      cached the content.  The content is usually divided into "chunks"
      that can be individually requested, sent back to the requester,
      cached into intermediate nodes.  The sending rate of content requests
      can be adjusted in order to perform congestion control, implementing
      a receiver driven transport protocol.  As it can be useful to have
      large chunks (significantly larger than the Maximum Tranfer Unit
      across the network), the transport protocol should also be used to
      further segment the chunks rather than relying to IP fragmentation.
      In this memo we define ICTP (Information Centric Transport Protocol),
      a receiver driven transport protocol for ICN, which relies on the
      CONET ICN solution described in a companion draft.

  "Omniscient AS112 Servers", Warren Kumari, William Sotomayor, Joe Abley,
  Ray Bellis, 2013-06-20, <draft-wkumari-dnsop-omniscient-as112-03.txt>

      The AS112 Project loosely coordinates Domain Name System (DNS)
      servers to which DNS zones corresponding to private use addresses are
      delegated.  Queries for names within those zones have no useful
      responses in a global context.  The purpose of this project is to
      reduce the load of such junk queries on the authoritative name
      servers that would otherwise receive them, and instead direct the
      load to name servers operated within the AS112 project.
      
      Due to the loosely-coordinated nature of the project, adding and
      dropping zones from the AS112 servers is difficult.  This document
      proposes a mechanism by which AS112 name servers could answer
      authoritatively for all possible zones.  This eliminates the add/drop
      problem, changing it to a matter of delegation within the DNS and
      requiring no operational changes on the servers themselves.
      
      This document updates RFC 6304.

  "Using DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and DNS-based Authentication of
  Named Entities (DANE) as a Prooftype for XMPP Domain Name Associations",
  Matthew Miller, Peter Saint-Andre, 2013-02-22,
  <draft-miller-xmpp-dnssec-prooftype-04.txt>

      This document defines a prooftype that uses DNS-based Authentication
      of Named Entities (DANE) for associating a domain name with an XML
      stream in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  It
      also defines a method that uses DNS Security (DNSSEC) for securely
      delegating a source domain to a derived domain in XMPP.

  "JSON Hypertext Application Language", Mike Kelly, 2013-02-12,
  <draft-kelly-json-hal-05.txt>

      This document proposes a media type for representing resources and
      their relations with hyperlinks.

  "Indoor Signal Position Conveyance", Kipp Jones, Christopher Steger,
  2013-05-08, <draft-jones-geopriv-sigpos-survey-02.txt>

      Location Information Servers rely on signal surveys to create a
      signal map allowing for subsequent device location determination.
      This document describes a method by which a Survey Device is able to
      provide indoor location related measurement data to a LIS for
      positioning purposes.  Location related measurement information
      comprises observations concerning properties related to the position
      of a Survey Device and the radio, electromagnetic, and other
      observable environmental measures as perceived by the Survey Device.
      These measurements could be data about Wi-Fi signals, Bluetooth
      signals, barometric pressure, or any other environmental measurement
      which could sent to a LIS for subsequent processing to help determine
      the location of devices that later enter the venue.  A basic set of
      location-related measurements, data rights disclosure and location
      types are defined.

  "Definition of Managed Objects for the Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc
  Distance-vector Routing Protocol - Next Generation (LOADng)", Ulrich
  Herberg, Robert Cole, Thomas Clausen, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-herberg-lln-loadng-mib-03.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
      In particular, it describes objects for configuring parameters of the
      Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol - Next
      Generation (LOADng) process on a router.  The MIB module defined in
      this memo, denoted LOADng-MIB, also reports state.  While LOADng is
      layer agnostic and can be run with different address families (e.g.,
      on L2 using MAC addreses, or on L3 using IP addresss), this MIB
      module assumes that LOADng is used on L3, and uses only IPv4/IPv6
      addresses.

  "Authenticated Encryption with AES-CBC and HMAC-SHA", David McGrew, John
  Foley, Kenny Paterson, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2-02.txt>

      This document specifies algorithms for authenticated encryption with
      associated data (AEAD) that are based on the composition of the
      Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
      mode of operation for encryption, and the HMAC-SHA message
      authentication code (MAC).
      
      These are randomized encryption algorithms, and thus are suitable for
      use with applications that cannot provide distinct nonces to each
      invocation of the AEAD encrypt operation.

  "CoAP Profile Description Format", Bert Greevenbosch, Jeroen Hoebeke,
  Isam Ishaq, Floris Van den Abeele, 2013-06-20,
  <draft-greevenbosch-core-profile-description-02.txt>

      This document provides a profile description format, that can be used
      to express capabilities of a CoAP server.
      
      Note
      
      Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should
      be sent to core@ietf.org.

  "An HTTP Status Code to Report Legal Obstacles", Tim Bray, 2013-07-10,
  <draft-tbray-http-legally-restricted-status-03.txt>

      This document specifies an additional Hypertext Transfer Protocol
      (HTTP) status code for use when resource access is denied due to
      legal demands.

  "Link relation Type Registrations for OAuth 2", William Mills,
  2013-02-04, <draft-wmills-oauth-lrdd-07.txt>

      Defines link relation type registrations for the OAuth 2
      authentication framework and OAuth 1.0a.

  "DNS Extension for Autonomous Internet(AIP)", Yuping Diao, Diao
  Yongping, Ming Liao, 2013-06-23, <draft-diao-aip-dns-03.txt>

      With the reality of Internet, Autonomous Internet technology
      in this article constructs independent autonomous extensible domain
      name architecture and domain name hierarchy through current domain
      name architecture, provides independent root DNS server, inner/outer
      DNS resolution mechanism for each autonomous internet network system,
      and provides reformation and transition solution from current
      Internet to realize autonomy even in unilateral action.

  "NVO3 Operational Requirements", Peter Ashwood-Smith, Ranga Iyengar,
  Tina Tsou, Ali Sajassi, Mohamed Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet, Masahiro
  Daikoku, 2013-07-14, <draft-ashwood-nvo3-operational-requirement-03.txt>

      This document provides framework and requirements for Network
      Virtualization over Layer 3 (NVO3) Operations, Administration, and
      Maintenance (OAM).  This document for the most part gathers
      requirements from existing IETF drafts and RFCs which have already
      extensively studied this subject for different data planes and
      layering.  As a result this draft is high level and broad.  We begin
      to ask which are truly required for NVO3 and expect the list to be
      narrowed by the working group as subsequent versions of this draft
      are created.

  "IP Fast Re-Route with Fast Notification", Andras Csaszar, Gabor Envedi,
  Jeff Tantsura, Sriganesh Kini, John Sucec, Subir Das, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-csaszar-rtgwg-ipfrr-fn-01.txt>

      This document describes the benefits and main applications of sending
      explicit fast notification (FN) packets to routers in an area. FN
      packets are generated and processed in the dataplane, and a single FN
      service can substitute existing OAM methods for remote failure
      detection, such as a full mesh of multi-hop BFD session. The FN
      service, therefore, decreases network overhead considerable. The main
      application is fast reroute in pure IP and in IP/LDP-MPLS networks
      called IPFRR-FN. The detour paths used when IPFRR-FN is active are in
      most cases identical to those used after Interior Gateway Protocol
      (IGP) convergence. The proposed mechanism can address all single
      link, node, and SRLG failures in an area; moreover it is an efficient
      solution to protect against BGP ASBR failures as well as VPN PE
      router failures. IPFRR-FN can be a supplemental tool to provide FRR
      when LFA cannot repair a failure case, while it can be a replacement
      of existing ASBR/PE protection mechanisms by overcoming their
      scalability and complexity issues.

  "An FTP Application Layer Gateway (ALG) for IPv4-to-IPv6 Translation",
  Tina Tsou, Simon Perreault, Jing Huang, 2012-06-15,
  <draft-tsou-behave-ftp46-00.txt>

      An FTP ALG for NAT64 was defined in RFC 6384.  Its scope was limited
      to an IPv6 client connecting to an IPv4 server.  This memo updates
      RFC 6384 with the case of an IPv4 client connecting to an IPv6
      server.

  "Stateless IPv4 Network Address Translation", Tina Tsou, Will Liu, Simon
  Perreault, Reinaldo Penno, Maoke Chen, 2012-10-22,
  <draft-tsou-stateless-nat44-02.txt>

      This memo describes a protocol for decentralizing IPv4 NAT to the
      customer-premises equipment (CPE) such that no state information is
      kept on the central NAT device.  The CPE uses a restricted source
      port set that is encoded in its provisioned IPv4 WAN address.  The
      NAT device performs only strictly stateless address (not port)
      translation.

  "Indication of support for reverse keep-alive", Christer Holmberg, Oscar
  Gallego, 2013-06-17, <draft-holmberg-sipcore-rkeep-02.txt>

      This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
      Via header field parameter, "rkeep".  The "rkeep" parameter allows a
      SIP entity to indicate willingness to receive keep-alives from its
      adjacent downstream SIP entity, the adjacent downstream SIP entity to
      indicate willingness to send keep-alives, and for SIP entities
      willing to send keep-alives to inform the receiver about the keep-
      alive interval.

  "An SNMP MIB extension to RFC3591 to manage optical interface parameters
  of DWDM applications", Ruediger Kunze, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-galikunze-ccamp-g-698-2-snmp-mib-03.txt>

      This memo defines a module of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in TCP/IP- based
      internet.  In particular, it defines objects for managing Optical
      parameters associated with Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
      (DWDM) interfaces.  This is an extension of the RFC3591 to support
      the optical parameters described in ITU-T G.698.2.  [ITU.G698.2]
      
      The MIB module defined in this memo can be used for Optical
      Parameters monitoring and/or configuration of the endpoints of Black
      Links.

  "OmniBroker Protocol", Phillip Hallam-Baker, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-hallambaker-omnibroker-06.txt,.pdf>

      An Omnibroker is an agent chosen and trusted by an Internet user to
      provide information such as name and certificate status information
      that are in general trusted even if they are not trustworthy.  Rather
      than acting as a mere conduit for information provided by existing
      services, an Omnibroker is responsible for curating those sources to
      protect the user.
      
      The Omnibroker Protocol (OBP) provides an aggregated interface to
      trusted Internet services including DNS, OCSP and various forms of
      authentication service.  Multiple transport bindings are supported to
      permit efficient access in virtually every common deployment scenario
      and ensure access in any deployment scenario in which access is not
      being purposely denied.

  "Using PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH) as a Prooftype for XMPP Domain Name
  Associations", Matthew Miller, Peter Saint-Andre, 2013-02-22,
  <draft-miller-xmpp-posh-prooftype-03.txt>

      This document defines a prooftype involving PKIX over Secure HTTP
      (POSH) for associating a domain name with an XML stream in the
      Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  It also defines a
      method involving HTTPS redirects (appropriate for use with the POSH
      prooftype) for securely delegating a source domain to a derived
      domain in XMPP.

  "Domain Name Associations (DNA) in the Extensible Messaging and Presence
  Protocol (XMPP)", Peter Saint-Andre, Matthew Miller, 2013-04-15,
  <draft-saintandre-xmpp-dna-02.txt>

      This document improves the security of the Extensible Messaging and
      Presence Protocol (XMPP) in two ways.  First, it specifies how
      "prooftypes" can establish a strong association between a domain name
      and an XML stream.  Second, it describes how to securely delegate a
      source domain to a derived domain, which is especially important in
      virtual hosting environments.

  "Request Routing and Content Acquisition", Ge Chen, Mian Li, Hongfei
  Xia, Changle Zou, Jie Liang, 2013-06-27,
  <draft-chen-cdni-rr-content-acquisition-02.txt>

      This document illustrates the details of an alternative method that
      can be used to provide request routing and content acquisition
      services.

  "CDNI Request Routing with SDN", Myung-Ki Shin, Seungik Lee, Dukhyun
  Chang, Ted Kwon, 2013-02-13,
  <draft-shin-cdni-request-routing-sdn-01.txt>

      Software-defined networking (SDN) is emerging and intensively
      discussed as one of the most promising technologies to provide
      centralized, programmable control planes for network service
      providers (NSPs). In this sense, SDN could be also considered as one
      of candidates to facilitate CDNI Request Routing. This document
      discusses how SDN can be used for downstream CDN selection within
      CDNI request routing.

  "Emergency Services Support in WebRTC", Bernard Aboba, Martin Thomson,
  2013-06-13, <draft-aboba-rtcweb-ecrit-01.txt>

      The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) framework supports
      interactive communication between web-browsers, including support for
      audio, video and text.  This document describes how emergency
      services functionality can be implemented within the WebRTC
      framework, including support for location and call routing as well as
      interoperability with Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs)
      supporting next generation emergency services.

  "TMPP for Both Two MPTCP-unaware Hosts", Kaiping Xue, Jing Guo, Peilin
  Hong, Lei Zhu, 2013-06-20, <draft-xue-mptcp-tmpp-unware-hosts-02.txt>

      Transparent MPTCP Proxy(TMPP) is an introduced network-based
      function, which is under MPTCP architecture.  It can help two MPTCP-
      unaware hosts enjoy multipath support, and can be extensively used
      both in the access networks and operators' networks.  Meanwhile, in
      MPTCP architecture with TMPP, TMPP needs to modify the received
      packets and transmit them again(just like gateway in NAT
      environment).  In this document, we also discuss the guarantee for
      data transfer on TMPP's side.  The consideration of data transfer can
      be expanded to the MPTCP architecture with proxy.

  "Flow Mobility In Multi-LMA Environment", Kaiping Xue, Dan Ni, Peilin
  Hong, Anthony Chan, 2013-06-20,
  <draft-xue-netext-flowmo-multilma-02.txt>

      PMIPv6 allows multiple Local Mobility Anchors(LMA) to exist in a
      PMIPv6 domain, it MAY cause that different interfaces of a mobile
      node(MN) are anchored in different LMAs.  This document proposes the
      extensions of Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol to support flow mobility in
      multi-LMA environment.  Among all the scenarios discussed here, the
      scenario in which different interfaces with different MAGs in multi-
      LMA environment cannot use traditional ways to realize flow mobility
      to an existing interface.

  "Routing optimization in DMM", Kaiping Xue, Lin Li, Peilin Hong, Pete
  McCann, 2013-06-20, <draft-xue-dmm-routing-optimization-02.txt>

      This draft proposes a PMIP-based routing optimization method in
      distributed anchor architecture.  The anchor of the mobile node is
      able to communicate with the anchor of corresponding node directly
      using optimized routing.  In this draft, there are two modes for the
      setup of routing optimization: the direct mode and the relay mode.
      The difference between them lies in that whether the routing
      optimization is set up directly or under the assistance of a third
      anchor.  The situation that Communication Node(CN) is a fixed
      terminal or a content server is also considered and 3 solutions are
      provided correspondingly.  The method proposed in this draft can
      reduce the delay and save signaling overhead in the current scheme.

  "VPWS support in E-VPN", Sami Boutros, Ali Sajassi, Samer Salam, John
  Drake, Jeff Tantsura, 2013-02-25, <draft-boutros-l2vpn-evpn-vpws-01.txt>

      This document describes how E-VPN can be used to support virtual
      private wire service (VPWS) in MPLS/IP networks. E-VPN enables the
      following characteristics for VPWS: active/standby as well as
      active/active multi-homing with flow-based load-balancing, eliminates
      the need for single-segment and multi-segment PW signaling, and
      provides fast protection using data-plane prefix independent
      convergence upon node or link failure.

  "A Roadmap for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Specification
  Documents", Martin Duke, Robert Braden, Wesley Eddy, Ethan Blanton,
  Alexander Zimmermann, 2013-05-21,
  <draft-zimmermann-tcpm-tcp-rfc4614bis-02.txt,.pdf>

      This document contains a "roadmap" to the Requests for Comments (RFC)
      documents relating to the Internet's Transmission Control Protocol
      (TCP).  This roadmap provides a brief summary of the documents
      defining TCP and various TCP extensions that have accumulated in the
      RFC series.  This serves as a guide and quick reference for both TCP
      implementers and other parties who desire information contained in
      the TCP-related RFCs.

  "LISP ITR Graceful Restart", Damien Saucez, Olivier Bonaventure, Luigi
  Iannone, Clarence Filsfils, 2013-06-24,
  <draft-saucez-lisp-itr-graceful-02.txt>

      The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) is a map-and-encap
      mechanism to enable communications between hosts identified with
      their Endpoint IDentifier (EID) over the Internet where EIDs are not
      routable.  To do so, packets toward EIDs are encapsulated in packets
      with routing locators (RLOCs) to form dynamic tunnels.  An Ingress
      Tunnel Router (ITR) that encapsulates EID packets determines tunnel
      endpoints via mappings that associate EIDs to RLOCs.  Before
      encapsulating a packet, the ITR queries the mapping system to obtain
      the mapping associated to the EID of the packet it must encapsulate.
      Such mapping is cached by the ITR in its local EID-to-RLOC Cache for
      any subsequent encapsulation for the same EID.  LISP is scalable
      because EID-to-RLOC mappings are cached on ITRs.  Initially, the
      cache is empty and is populated progressively according to the
      traffic traversing the ITR.  However, after an ITR is restarted,
      e.g., for maintenance reason, its cache is empty which means that all
      packets that are re-routed to the freshly restarted ITR will cause
      cache misses and a potentially high loss rate.  In this draft, we
      present mechanisms to reduce the negative impact on traffic caused by
      the restart of an ITR in a LISP network.

  "Loop Free RPL", Jianlin Guo, Philip Orlik, 2013-06-26,
  <draft-guo-roll-loop-free-rpl-02.txt>

      The IETF has developed the IPv6 based standards for Low-power and
      Lossy Networks (LLNs) to meet requirements of constrained
      applications, such as field monitoring, inventory control and so on.
      The IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) was published as [RFC6550]
      in March 2012. Based on routing metrics and constraints [RFC6551],
      RPL builds Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology to establish
      bidirectional routes for LLNs for traffic types of multipoint-to-
      point, point-to-multipoint, and point-to-point. RPL routes are
      optimized for traffic to or from one or more roots that act as sinks.
      As a result, a DAG is partitioned into one or more Destination
      Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), one DODAG per sink. RPL is widely considered
      as a feasible routing protocol for LLNs. However, DODAG loops and
      lack of a loop free DODAG local repair mechanism are two open issues
      to be addressed. This draft introduces an alternative rank and an
      Objective Function to eliminate DODAG loops in RPL. Based on the
      proposed rank and Objective Function, this draft introduces a loop
      free RPL.

  "Fragmentation Revisited", Fred Templin, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-generic-6man-tunfrag-09.txt>

      IP fragmentation has long been subject for scrutiny since the
      publication of "Fragmentation Considered Harmful" in 1987.  This work
      cast fragmentation in a negative light that has persisted to the
      present day.  However, the tone of the work failed to honor two
      principles of creative thinking: never say "always" and never say
      "never".  This document discusses uses for fragmentation that apply
      both to the present day and moving forward into the future.

  "Connecting Disparate TRILL-based Data Center/PBB/Campus sites using

      There is a need to connect (a) TRILL based data centers or (b) TRILL
      based networks which provide Provider Backbone like functionalities
      or (c) Campus TRILL based networks over the WAN using one or more
      ISPs that provide regular IP+GRE or IP+MPLS transport. Some of the
      solutions proposed as in [DRAFT-EVPN] have not dealt with the
      scalable methods in their details as to how these services could be
      provided such that multiple TRILL sites can be inter-connected with
      issues like nick-name collisions for unicast and multicast being
      taken care of. It has been found that with extensions to BGP and a
      scalable method on Provider edge devices the problem statement which
      we will define below can be handled. Specifically the division of the
      nick-name into site-id and Rbridge-ID is one that can limit the
      number of sites that can be interconnected and the number of Rbridges
      within each such site that can be provisioned. The draft proposed
      herein deals / overcomes these issues by not limiting the number of
      sites and Rbridges within a TRILL site interconnect. Only the maximum
      space for a nick-name which happens to be 16 bits is the actual
      limit. MAC moves across TRILL sites and within TRILL sites can also
      be realized. This document / proposal envisions the use of BGP-MAC-
      VPN vrfs at the ISP cloud PE devices. We deal in depth with the
      control plane and data plane particulars for unicast and multicast in
      this scheme. Additionally Provider Backbone like functionality is
      also covered.

  "Problem Details for HTTP APIs", Mark Nottingham, Erik Wilde,
  2013-06-03, <draft-nottingham-http-problem-04.txt>

      This document defines a "problem detail" as a way to carry machine-
      readable details of errors in a HTTP response, to avoid the need to
      invent new error response formats for HTTP APIs.
      
      Note to Readers
      
      This draft should be discussed on the apps-discuss mailing list [1].

  "TRILL Resilient Distribution Trees", Mingui Zhang, Tissa Senevirathne,
  Janardhanan Pathangi, Ayan Banerjee, Anoop Ghanwani, 2013-04-23,
  <draft-zhang-trill-resilient-trees-02.txt>

      TRILL protocol provides layer 2 multicast data forwarding using IS-IS
      link state routing. Distribution trees are computed based on the link
      state information through Shortest Path First calculation and shared
      among VLANs across the campus. When a link on the distribution tree
      fails, a campus-wide recovergence of this distribution tree will take
      place, which can be time consuming and may cause considerable
      disruption to the ongoing multicast service.
      
      This document proposes to build the backup distribution tree to
      protect links on the primary distribution tree. Since the backup
      distribution tree is built up ahead of the link failure, when a link
      on the primary distribution tree fails, the pre-installed backup
      forwarding table will be utilized to deliver multicast packets
      without waiting for the campus-wide recovergence, which minimizes the
      service disruption.

  "Implications of Blocking Outgoing Ports Except Ports 80 and 443", Marc
  Blanchet, 2013-07-31, <draft-blanchet-iab-internetoverport443-02.txt>

      Users are often connected to Internet with very few outgoing ports
      available, such as only port 80 and 443 over TCP.  This situation has
      many implications on designing, deploying and using IETF protocols,
      such as encaspulating protocols within HTTP, difficulty to do traffic
      engineering, quality of service, peer-to-peer, multi-channel
      protocols or deploying new transport protocols.  This document
      describes the situation and its implications.

  "MSML Package for the Media Control Channel Framework", Adnan Saleem,
  Steve Dunn, 2013-07-02, <draft-saleem-mediactrl-msml-package-02.txt>

      The Media Server Markup Language [RFC5707] is used to control and
      invoke many different types of services on IP media servers. MSML can
      be used, for example, to control media server conferencing features
      such as video layout and audio mixing, create sidebar conferences or
      personal mixes, and set the properties of media streams.  As well,
      clients can use MSML to define media processing dialogs, which may be
      used as parts of application interactions with users or conferences.
      This document describes the use of MSML [RFC5707] language used
      within the context of Media Control Channel Framework [RFC6230]. The
      use of MSML [RFC5707] is described here as a standalone package for
      use within and compliant with the Media Control Channel Framework
      [RFC6230].

  "Framework and Requirements for GMPLS based control of Flexi-grid DWDM
  networks", Oscar de Dios, Ramon Casellas, Fatai Zhang, Xihua Fu, Daniele
  Ceccarelli, Iftekhar Hussain, 2013-06-05,
  <draft-ogrcetal-ccamp-flexi-grid-fwk-03.txt>

      This document defines a framework and the associated control plane
      requirements for the GMPLS based control of flexi-grid DWDM networks.
      To allow efficient allocation of optical spectral bandwidth for high
      bit-rate systems, the International Telecommunication Union
      Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has extended the
      recommendations [G.694.1] and [G.872] to include the concept of
      flexible grid.  A new DWDM grid has been developed within the ITU-T
      Study Group 15 by defining a set of nominal central frequencies,
      channel spacings and the concept of "frequency slot".  In such
      environment, a data plane connection is switched based on allocated,
      variable-sized frequency ranges within the optical spectrum.

  "Enhanced Sleepy Node Support for CoAP", Akbar Rahman, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-rahman-core-sleepy-03.txt>

      CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained devices.
      These devices typically have some combination of limited battery
      power, small memory footprint and low throughput links.  It is
      expected that in CoAP networks there will be a certain portion of
      devices that are "sleepy" and which may occasionally go into a sleep
      mode (i.e. go into a low power state to conserve power) and
      temporarily suspend CoAP protocol communication.  This document
      proposes a minimal and efficient mechanism building on the Resource
      Directory concept to enhance sleepy node support in CoAP networks.

  "Using PCP to update dynamic DNS", Xiaohong Deng, Mohamed Boucadair, Qin
  Zhao, Jing Huang, 2013-07-15, <draft-deng-pcp-ddns-03.txt>

      This document focuses on the problems encountered when using dynamic
      DNS in address sharing contexts (e.g., DS-Lite, NAT64, A+P)during
      IPv6 transition. Issues, possible solutions and preliminary
      implementation and validation of one of the solutions are documented
      in this memo.

  "Transitive BGP Graceful Restart", Haifeng Zhang, Alvaro Retana,
  2013-03-25, <draft-zhang-idr-transitive-gr-02.txt>

      This document defines an extension to BGP Graceful Restart that
      reduces the negative impact of multiple inter-connected routers
      restarting.  The proposed mechanism does not require any changes to
      the BGP protocol.

  "Deprecation of AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET in BGP", Warren Kumari,
  Kotikalapudi Sriram, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-kumari-deprecate-as-set-confed-set-02.txt>

      RFC 6472 (i.e., BCP 172) recommends not using AS_SET and
      AS_CONFED_SET in BGP.  This document updates RFC 4271 and proscribes
      the use of the AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET types of the AS_PATH in
      BGPv4.  This is done to simplify the design and implementation of BGP
      and to make the semantics of the originator of a route more clear.
      This will also simplify the design, implementation, and deployment of
      ongoing work in the Secure Inter-Domain Routing Working Group.

  "Provisioning Message Authentication Key for PCP using PANA

      This document specifies a mechanism for provisioning PCP (Port
      Control Protocol) message authentication key using PANA (Protocol for
      carrying Authentication for Network Access).

  "Securing Model-C Inter-Provider L2 VPNs with Label Hopping and TicToc",
  Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Bhargav Bhikkaji,
  2013-04-08, <draft-mjsraman-l2vpn-vpls-tictoc-label-hop-03.txt>

      In certain models of inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label Switching
      (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) spoofing attack against
      VPN sites is a key concern. For example, MPLS-based VPN inter-
      provider model "C" for VPLS, or any L2 VPN purpose is not favoured,
      owing to security concerns in the dataplane, even though it can scale
      with respect to maintenance of routing state. Since the inner labels
      associated with VPN sites are not encrypted during transmission, a
      man-in-the-middle attacker can spoof packets to a specific L2 VPN
      site. In this paper, we propose a label-hopping technique which uses
      a set of randomized labels and a method for hopping amongst these
      labels using the time instant the packet leaves the port from a
      sending Provider Edge Router. To prevent the attacker from
      identifying the labels in polynomial time, we also use an additional
      label. The proposed technique can be applied to other variants of
      inter-provider MPLS based VPNs where Multi-Protocol exterior-BGP (MP-
      eBGP) multi-hop is used. As we address a key security concern, we can
      make a case for the deployment of MPLS based L2 VPN inter-provider
      model "C". Specifically we use the TicToc based Precision Time
      Protocol LSP to provide the timing for determining the time instant
      at which the packet is sent from the remote end Provider Edge Router
      and hence calculating when it must have left that peer at the
      Provider Edge Router in the near / receiving end.
      
      This version of the document suggests a better method for gaining
      more finely granular time slices. This is done by running the PTP LSP
      between the ASBRs in the ASes that are providing the inter-AS L2VPN
      service.

  "Opportunistic Routing based on Users Daily Life Routine", Waldir
  Moreira, Paulo Mendes, Ronedo Ferreira, Douglas Cirqueira, Eduardo
  Cerqueira, 2013-04-25, <draft-moreira-dlife-02.txt>

      This document is written in the context of the Delay Tolerant
      Networking Research Group and will be presented for reviewing by that
      group. This document defines dLife, an opportunistic routing protocol
      that takes advantage of time-evolving social structures. dLife
      belongs to the family of social-aware opportunistic routing protocols
      for intermittently connected networks. dLife operates based on a
      representation of the dynamics of social structures as a weighted
      contact graph, where the weights (i.e., social strengths) express how
      long a pair of nodes is in contact over different period of times. It
      considers two complementary utility functions: Time-Evolving Contact
      Duration (TECD) that captures the evolution of social interaction
      among pairs of users in the same daily period of time, over
      consecutive days; and TECD Importance (TECDi) that captures the
      evolution of user's importance, based on its node degree and the
      social strength towards its neighbors, in different periods of time.
      It is intended for use in wireless networks where there is no
      guarantee that a fully connected path between any source -
      destination pair exists at any time, a scenario where traditional
      routing protocols are unable to deliver bundles. Such networks can be
      sparse mesh, in which case intermittent connectivity is due to lack
      of physical connections, or dense mesh, in which case intermittent
      connectivity may be due to high interference or shadowing. In any
      case, intermittent connectivity can also be due to the availability
      of devices (e.g., unavailable due to power saving rules). The
      document presents an architectural overview followed by the protocol
      specification.

  "Multi layer implications in GMPLS controlled networks", Daniele
  Ceccarelli, Francesco Fondelli, Sergio Belotti, Dimitri Papadimitriou,
  2013-02-25, <draft-bcg-ccamp-gmpls-ml-implications-04.txt>

      This document describes requirements for MRN application to multiple
      hierarchies of technologies (e.g.  OTN, SDH, ETH).  For this purpose,
      after summarizing MRN definitions, rationales and currently supported
      applications, a problem statement is introduced together with its
      implications on GMPLS routing and signaling.  New functional
      requirements are derived and MRN extensions required to address them
      are identified.

  "Mapping PMIP Quality of Service in WiFi Network", John Kaippallimalil,
  2013-04-21, <draft-kaippallimalil-netext-pmip-qos-wifi-02.txt>

      This document proposes a model for configuring and mapping PMIP QoS
      parameters of a mobile network session to the corresponding
      connection at a WiFi Access Point. In congested network conditions,
      it is useful for an MN's flows to be policed and shaped at the WLC
      and WiFi AP to match  bandwidth constraints or service priority of
      the user's subscription. Applying similar QoS management at the WiFi
      AP and WLC allows optimal use of network resources. Currently, the
      WiFi AP does not have information on the MNs subscribed bandwidth, or
      relative priority of its flows or services for per user QoS handling
      at the WiFi AP. This document provides a model for mapping PMIP QoS
      to corresponding 802.11e QoS parameters.

  "PPSP Tracker Protocol--Extended Protocol", Rachel Huang, Ning Zong, Rui
  Cruz, Mario Nunes, Joao Taveira, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-huang-ppsp-extended-tracker-protocol-04.txt>

      This document specifies an extended Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol -
      Tracker Protocol, which is a new extension protocol complementing the
      basic core messages and usages specified in the base tracker protocol
      for the exchange of meta information between trackers and peers, such as
      initial offer/request of participation in multimedia content streaming,
      content information, peer lists and reports of activity and status. It
      extends the base tracker protocol to include new optional messages
      providing new usages in the communications between peer and tracker. The
      extension protocol is retro-compatible with the base tracker protocol.

  "Path Computation Element (PCE) Protocol Extension for Stateful PCE
  Usage in GMPLS Networks", Xian Zhang, Young Lee, Fatai Zhang, Ramon
  Casellas, Oscar de Dios, 2013-02-21,
  <draft-zhang-pce-pcep-stateful-pce-gmpls-02.txt>

      The Path Computation Element (PCE) facilitates Traffic Engineering
      (TE) based path calculation in large, multi-domain, multi-region, or
      multi-layer networks. [Stateful-PCE] provides the fundamental PCEP
      extensions needed to support stateful PCE functions, without
      specifying the technology-specific extensions. This memo provides
      extensions required for PCE communication protocol (PCEP) so as to
      enable the usage of a stateful PCE capability in GMPLS networks.

  "Aware Spanning Tree Topology Change on RBridges", Li Yizhou, Hao
  Weiguo, Jon Hudson, Naveen Nimmu, Anoop Ghanwani, 2013-05-02,
  <draft-yizhou-trill-tc-awareness-02.txt>

      When a local LAN running spanning tree protocol connecting to TRILL
      campus via more than one RBridge, there are several ways to perform
      loop avoidance. One of them illustrated by RFC6325 [RFC6325] A.3 was
      to make relevant ports on edge RBridges involving in spanning tree
      calculation. When edge RBridges are emulated as a single highest
      priority root, the local bridged LAN will be naturally partitioned
      after running spanning tree protocol. This approach achieves better
      link utilization and intra-VLAN load balancing in some scenarios.
      This document describes how the edge RBridges react to topology
      change occurring in bridged LAN in order to make the abovementioned
      spanning tree approach function correct.

  "ALTO Extensions for Collecting Data Center Resource Information", Young
  Lee, Greg Bernstein, Dhruv Dhody, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-lee-alto-ext-dc-resource-02.txt>

      In a networked application environment where resources (e.g.,
      computing, storage, etc.) are geographically distributed in Data
      Centers, a key decision is to allocate the application request to an
      "optimal" Data Center location in which to host the application
      request. Key constraints in this decision include resource
      availability, network cost, infrastructure constraints (e.g., power)
      and others. This draft proposes an ALTO extension to support data
      center resource information model and its related protocol
      extensions.

  Nakamura, Satoru Izumi, Hiroshi Tsunoda, Masahiro Matsuda, Kohei Ohta,
  2013-07-11, <draft-suganuma-greenmib-02.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB),
      the GreenUsage MIB, for use with network management protocols
      in the Internet community.  In particular, the GreenUsage MIB
      can be used to monitor the power-on/power-off status of electrical
      devices.

  "Analysis of Semantic Embedded IPv6 Address Schemas", Sheng Jiang, Qiong
  Sun, Ian Farrer, Yang Bo, Tianle Yang, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-jiang-semantic-prefix-06.txt>

      This informational document discusses the use of embedded semantics
      within IPv6 address schemas.  Network operators who have large IPv6
      address space may choose to embed some semantics into their IPv6
      addressing by assigning additional significance to specific bits
      within the prefix.  By embedding semantics into IPv6 prefixes, the
      semantics of packets can be easily inspected.  This can simplify the
      packet differentiation process.  However, semantic embedded IPv6
      address schemas have their own operational cost and even potential
      pitfalls.  Some complex semantic embedded IPv6 address schemas may
      also require new technologies in addition to existing Internet
      protocols.
      
      The document aims to understand the usage of semantic embedded IPv6
      address schemas, and neutrally analyze on the associated advantages,
      drawbacks and technical gaps for more complex address schemas.

  "LISP Single-Hop DHT Mapping Overlay", Li Cheng, Jun Wang, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-cheng-lisp-shdht-04.txt>

      This draft specifies the LISP Single-Hop Distributed Hash Table
      Mapping Database (LISP-SHDHT), a distributed mapping database which
      consists of a set of SHDHT Nodes to provide mappings from LISP
      Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) to Routing Locators (RLOCs).  EID
      namespace is dynamically distributed among SHDHT Nodes based on DHT
      Hash algorithm.  Each SHDHT Node is configured with one or more hash
      spaces which contain multiple EID-prefixes along with RLOCs of
      corresponding Map Servers.

  "MAP Interoperability Testing Results", Xing Li, Congxiao Bao, Guoliang
  Han, Wojciech Dec, 2013-07-05, <draft-xli-softwire-map-testing-02.txt>

      This document presents the testing results of a unified code
      accommodating encapsulation and translation modes of Mapping of
      Address and Port (MAP).  Experiments show that the unified MAP CE is
      not only supporting MAP-E and MAP-T modes, but also backward
      compatible with AFTR of dual-stack lite and stateless/stateful NAT64.

  "Extensions to OSPF facilitating the deployment of non-backward-
  compatible changes.", Mike Dubrovsky, Rashmi Shrivastava, Dean Cheng,
  2013-02-16, <draft-ospf-non-compatible-01.txt>

      This document specifies a generic mechanism that facilitates the
      deployment of non-backward-compatible changes in OSPF protocol.  This
      mechanism allows the OSPF routers to advertise the capability of non-
      backward-compatible functionality and to make the functionality
      operational only when supported by all participating routers.
      Depending on the functionality scope, capability advertisements must
      be propagated across a link, area or autonomous system (AS).  For
      link and area scope functionality, Router Information Link State
      Advertisement (LSA) is utilized to propagate the capability
      information.  For the cases when compatibility must be maintained
      across the whole OSPF autonomous system, new Area Information (AI)
      LSA is introduced.  The AI LSA is a TLV-based analog of Indication-
      LSA that is used for demand circuit functionality and described in
      RFC1793.

  "A SNMP MIB to manage GMPLS with General Constraints support", Gabriele
  Galimberti, Giovanni Martinelli, Dharini Hiremagalur, Gert Grammel,
  2013-07-14, <draft-gmggm-ccamp-gencons-snmp-mib-02.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for GMPLS based
      networks.
      
      In particular in the context Wavelength Switching Optical Network
      (WSON) two sets of information were defined: a general constrains set
      (reusable by other technologies) and a WSON specific set.  This
      document defines a MIB module for supporting general constrain
      information.

  "RADIUS Attribute for 4rd", Sheng Jiang, Yu Fu, Bing Liu, 2013-08-02,
  <draft-jiang-softwire-4rd-radius-03.txt>

      IPv4 Residual Deployment via IPv6 (4rd) is a stateless mechanism for
      running IPv4 over IPv6-only infrastructure. It provides both IPv4 and
      IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-
      existing period. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
      (DHCPv6) 4rd options has been defined to configure 4rd Customer Edge
      (CE). However, in many networks, the configuration information may be
      stored in Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers
      while user configuration is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway
      (BNG) through DHCPv6 protocol. This document defines a Remote
      Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries
      4rd configuration information from AAA server to BNG. The 4rd RADIUS
      attribute are designed following the simplify principle. It provides
      just enough information to form the correspondent DHCPv6 4rd option.

  Prefixes", Qian Wang, Wei Meng, Cui Wang, Mohamed Boucadair, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-hu-softwire-multicast-radius-ext-03.txt>

      This document specifies a new Remote Authentication Dial-In User
      Service (RADIUS) attribute to carry the Multicast-Prefixes-64
      information, aiming to delivery the Multicast and Unicast IPv6
      Prefixes to be used to build multicast and unicast IPv4-Embedded IPv6
      addresses. this RADIUS attribute is defined based on the equivalent
      DHCPv6 OPTION_PREFIX64 option.

  "Filtering of Overlapping Routes", Russ White, Alvaro Retana, Susan
  Hares, 2013-02-25, <draft-white-grow-overlapping-routes-01.txt>

      This document proposes a mechanism to remove a prefix when it
      overlaps with a functionally equivalent shorter prefix.  The proposed
      mechanism does not require any changes to the BGP protocol.

  "The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Holder-of-the-Key Token Usage",

  <draft-tschofenig-oauth-hotk-02.txt>

      OAuth 2.0 deployments currently rely on bearer tokens for securing
      access to protected resources.  Bearer tokens require Transport Layer
      Security to be used between an OAuth client and the resource server
      when presenting the access token.  The security model is based on
      proof-of-possession: access token storage and transfer has to be done
      with care to prevent leakage.
      
      There are, however, use cases that require a more active involvement
      of the OAuth client for an increased level of security, particularly
      to secure against token leakage.  This document specifies an OAuth
      security framework using the holder-of-the-key concept, which
      requires the OAuth client when presenting an OAuth access token to
      also demonstrate knowledge of keying material that is bound to the
      token.

  "Third-Party ALTO Server Discovery (3pdisc)", Sebastian Kiesel, Kilian
  Krause, Martin Stiemerling, 2013-07-15, <draft-kist-alto-3pdisc-04.txt>

      The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
      provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several
      hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired
      resource.  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an
      ALTO client can ask for guidance it needs to discover one or more
      ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance.
      
      This document specifies a procedure for third-party ALTO server
      discovery, which can be used if the ALTO client is not co-located
      with the actual resource consumer, but instead embedded in a third
      party such as a peer-to-peer tracker.
      
      Technically, the algorithm specified in this document takes one
      IP address and a U-NAPTR Service Parameter (i.e., "ALTO:http" or
      "ALTO:https") as parameters.  It performs several DNS lookups (for
      U-NAPTR and SOA resource records) and returns one or more URI(s) of
      information resources related to that IP address.

  "A Framework and Requirements for Energy Aware Control Planes", Alvaro
  Retana, Russ White, Manuel Paul, 2013-02-13,
  <draft-retana-rtgwg-eacp-01.txt>

      There has been, for several years, a rising concern over the energy
      usage of large scale networks.  This concern is strongly focused on
      campus, data center, and other highly concentrated deployments of
      network infrastructure.  Given the steadily increasing demand for
      higher network speeds, always-on service models, and ubiquitous
      network coverage, it is also of growing importance for
      telecommunication networks both local and wide area in scope.  One of
      the issues in moving forward to reduce energy usage is to ensure that
      the network can still meet the performance specifications required to
      support the applications running over it.
      
      This document provides an overview of the various areas of concern in
      the interaction between network performance and efforts at energy
      aware control planes, as a guide for those working on modifying
      current control planes or designing new control planes to improve the
      energy efficiency of high density, highly complex, network
      deployments.

  <draft-wing-mmusic-ice-mobility-04.txt>

      This specification describes how endpoint mobility can be achieved
      using ICE.  Two mechanisms are shown, one where both endpoints
      support ICE and another where only one endpoint supports ICE.

  "<Performance Issues with MPTCP>", Ramin Khalili, Nicolas Gast, Miroslav
  Popovic, Jean-Yves Le Boudec, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-khalili-mptcp-performance-issues-03.txt,.pdf>

      We show, by measurements over a testbed and by mathematical analysis,
      that the current MPTCP suffers from two problems: (P1) Upgrading some
      TCP users to MPTCP can reduce the throughput of others without any
      benefit to the upgraded users; and (P2) MPTCP users can be
      excessively aggressive towards TCP users. We attribute these problems
      to the "Linked Increases" Algorithm (LIA) of MPTCP [4], and more
      specifically, to an excessive amount of traffic transmitted over
      congested paths. Our results show that these problems are important
      and can be mitigated. We believe that the design of the congestion
      control of MPTCP should be improved.

  "ALTO Extensions to Support Application and Network Resource Information

      L1VPNs provide customer services and connectivity at layer 1 over
      layer 1 networks. The operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic
      Mode and the Enhanced Mode, where the Enhanced Mode of operation may
      also include exchange of routing information between the layer 1
      network and the customer domain.

  "Multipath RTP (MPRTP) attribute in Session Description Protocol", Varun
  Singh, Joerg Ott, Teemu Karkkainen, Ralf Globisch, Thomas Schierl,

      Multipath RTP (MPRTP) is an extension to the Real-time Transport
      Protocol (RTP) that allows multi-homed endpoints to take advantage of
      the availability of multiple Internet paths between endpoints to send
      /receive media packets.  This document describes how to express the
      interface advertisement and negotiation during session setup in SDP
      (Session Description Protocol).

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Recording Call Flows", Ram R,
  Parthasarathi Ravindran, Paul Kyzivat, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ram-siprec-callflows-03.txt>

      Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
      environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
      these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
      compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
      is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
      recording device.  This document lists call flows that has snapshot
      of metadata sent from SRC to SRS, the metadata format for which is
      described in [I-D.ietf-siprec-metadata] .  This is purely an
      informational document that is written to support the model defined
      in the metadata draft.

  "An Acceptable Use Policy for New ICMP Types and Codes", Melinda Shore,
  Carlos Pignataro, 2013-03-26, <draft-shore-icmp-aup-03.txt>

      Concerns about lack of clarity concerning when to add new Internet
      Control Message Protocol (ICMP) types and/or codes have highlighted a
      need to describe policies for when adding new features to ICMP is
      desirable and when it is not.  In this document we provide a basic
      description of ICMP's role in the IP stack and some guidelines for
      the future.

  "Use of BGP for routing in large-scale data centers", Petr Lapukhov,
  Ariff Premji, Jon Mitchell, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-lapukhov-bgp-routing-large-dc-05.txt>

      Some network operators build and operate data centers that support
      over one hundred thousand servers.  In this document, such data
      centers are referred to as "large-scale" to differentiate them from
      smaller infrastructures.  Environments of this scale have a unique
      set of network requirements with an emphasis on operational
      simplicity and network stability.  This document summarizes
      operational experience in designing and operating large-scale data
      centers using BGP as the only routing protocol.  The intent is to
      report on a proven and stable routing design that could be leveraged
      by others in the industry.

  "Shared Memory Communications over RDMA", Mike Fox, Constantinos
  Kassimis, Jerry Stevens, 2013-05-31,
  <draft-fox-tcpm-shared-memory-rdma-02.txt>

      This document describes the Shared Memory Communications over RDMA
      (SMC-R) protocol.  This protocol provides RDMA communications to TCP
      endpoints in a manner that is transparent to socket applications.  It
      further provides for dynamic discovery of partner RDMA capabilities
      and dynamic setup of RDMA connections, transparent high availability
      and load balancing when redundant RDMA network paths are available,
      and it maintains many of the traditional TCP/IP qualities of service
      such as filtering that enterprise users demand, as well as TCP socket
      semantics such as urgent data.

  "Framework for Point-to-Multipoint MPLS-TP OAM", Yoshinori Koike,
  Takafumi Hamano, Masatoshi Namiki, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-hmk-mpls-tp-p2mp-oam-framework-02.txt>

      The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized to enable
      carrier-grade packet transport.
      
      This document discusses and specifies the P2MP framework primarily
      related to OAM and related management in MPLS-TP networks. This
      document mainly refers to RFC5654 and RFC6371. The main focus is on
      the details that are not covered or not clarified in relevant RFCs
      such as RFC5654, RFC5860, RFC5921, RFC5951, RFC6371, and draft-mpls-
      tp-p2mp-framework.
      
      Note: This I-D was made and updated including the discussions in ITU-
      T SG15, which were described in Liaison Statements such as
      (https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1235/)
      
      This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
      Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
      Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
      capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

  "LISP Control-Plane Multicast Signaling", Dino Farinacci, Maria
  Napierala, 2013-07-11, <draft-farinacci-lisp-mr-signaling-02.txt>

      This document describes an alternate method to signal multicast tree
      building among xTRs in multicast capable LISP sites.  This approach
      avoids the need to run a multicast routing protocol on the LISP
      overlay.

  "Network Performance Isolation in Data Centres using Congestion
  Policing", Bob Briscoe, Murari Sridharan, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-briscoe-conex-data-centre-01.txt>

      This document describes how a multi-tenant (or multi-department) data
      centre operator can isolate tenants from network performance
      degradation due to each other's usage, but without losing the
      multiplexing benefits of a LAN-style network where anyone can use any
      amount of any resource.  Zero per-tenant configuration and no
      implementation change is required on network equipment.  Instead the
      solution is implemented with a simple change to the hypervisor (or
      container) beneath the tenant's virtual machines on every physical
      server connected to the network.  These collectively enforce a very
      simple distributed contract - a single network allowance that each
      tenant can allocate among their virtual machines, even if distributed
      around the network.  The solution uses layer-3 switches that support
      explicit congestion notification (ECN).  It is best if the sending
      operating system supports congestion exposure (ConEx).  Nonetheless,
      the operator can unilaterally deploy a complete solution while
      operating systems are being incrementally upgraded to support ConEx
      and ECN.

  "Automatic Key and Adjacency Management for Routing Protocols", 
  william.atwood@concordia.ca, Revathi Somanatha, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-atwood-karp-akam-rp-03.txt>

      When tightening the security of the core routing infrastructure, two
      steps are necessary.  The first is to secure the routing protocols'
      packets on the wire.  The second is to ensure that the keying
      material for the routing protocol exchanges is distributed only to
      the appropriate routers.  This document specifies requirements on
      that distribution and proposes the use of a set of protocols to
      achieve those requirements.

  "Using Security Posture Assessment to Grant Access to Enterprise Network
  Resources", David Waltermire, Adam Montville, David Harrington,
  2013-07-15, <draft-waltermire-sacm-use-cases-05.txt>

      This memo documents a sampling of use cases for securely aggregating
      configuration and operational data and assessing that data to
      determine an organization's security posture.  From these operational
      use cases, we can derive common functional capabilities and
      requirements to guide development of vendor-neutral, interoperable
      standards for aggregating and assessing data relevant to security
      posture.

  "Transparent SDH/SONET over Packet", Gert Manhoudt, Stephan Roullot, Kin
  Wong, 2013-02-08, <draft-manhoudt-pwe3-tsop-02.txt>

      This document describes the Transparent SDH/SONET over Packet (TSoP)
      mechanism to encapsulate Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) or
      Synchronous Optical NETwork (SONET) bit-streams in a packet format,
      suitable for Pseudowire (PW) transport over a packet switched network
      (PSN).  The key property of the TSoP  method is that it transports
      the SDH/SONET client signal in its entirety through the PW, i.e., no
      use is made of any specific characteristic of the SONET/SDH signal
      format, other than its bit rate.  The TSoP transparency includes
      transporting the timing properties of the SDH/SONET client signal.
      This ensures a maximum of transparency and a minimum of complexity,
      both in implementation and during operation.

  "Tail Loss Probe (TLP): An Algorithm for Fast Recovery of Tail Losses",
  Nandita Dukkipati, Neal Cardwell, Yuchung Cheng, Matt Mathis,
  2013-02-25, <draft-dukkipati-tcpm-tcp-loss-probe-01.txt>

      Retransmission timeouts are detrimental to application latency,
      especially for short transfers such as Web transactions where
      timeouts can often take longer than all of the rest of a transaction.
      The primary cause of retransmission timeouts are lost segments at the
      tail of transactions.  This document describes an experimental
      algorithm for TCP to quickly recover lost segments at the end of
      transactions or when an entire window of data or acknowledgments are
      lost.  Tail Loss Probe (TLP) is a sender-only algorithm that allows
      the transport to recover tail losses through fast recovery as opposed
      to lengthy retransmission timeouts.  If a connection is not receiving
      any acknowledgments for a certain period of time, TLP transmits the
      last unacknowledged segment (loss probe).  In the event of a tail
      loss in the original transmissions, the acknowledgment from the loss
      probe triggers SACK/FACK based fast recovery.  TLP effectively avoids
      long timeouts and thereby improves TCP performance.

  "Congestion control algorithm for lower latency and lower loss media
  transport", Piers O'Hanlon, Ken Carlberg, 2013-04-24,
  <draft-ohanlon-rmcat-dflow-02.txt>

      This memo provides a design for a congestion control algorithm, for
      media transport, which aims to provide for lower delay and lower loss
      communications.

  "Signaling Virtual Machine Activity to the Network Virtualization Edge",
  Kireeti Kompella, Yakov Rekhter, Thomas Morin, David Black, 2013-04-29,
  <draft-kompella-nvo3-server2nve-02.txt>

      This document proposes a simplified approach for provisioning network
      parameters related to Virtual Machine creation, migration and
      termination on servers.  The idea is to provision the server, then
      have the server signal the requisite parameters to the relevant
      network device(s).  Such an approach reduces the workload on the
      provisioning system and simplifies the data model that the
      provisioning system needs to maintain.  It is also more resilient to
      topology changes in server-network connectivity, for example,
      reconnecting a server to a different network port or switch.

  "MPLS PIM Inter-working", Bisong Tao, 2013-03-13,
  <draft-tao-mpls-pim-interworking-01.txt>

      This document describes a framework for the inter-working between
      Protocol Independent Multicast [PIM] and a leaf-driven P2MP tunnel
      signaling protocol so that multiple PIM sites around an MPLS network
      can form a single PIM domain without compromising PIM's features,
      scalability, and performance.

  "Stateful Observation in CoAP", Changsha Ma, Peilin Hong, Kaiping Xue,
  2013-06-24, <draft-ma-core-stateful-observe-02.txt>

      The Observe Option allows a CoAP client to observe changes in the
      state of resources and obtain a current representation of the last
      resource state.  To be an observer of an origin server's resources,
      the client is required to register its interest with the server.  A
      successful registration will make the client added into the server's
      observation list, while a failed one MAY drive the client to re-
      register.
      
      However, repeated and frequent re-registrations cannot guarantee the
      client to eventually become an observer of the target server.  In the
      case that the server is unable or unwilling to accept an observer,
      the time-intensive re-registrations will just bring redundant
      messages in the constrained network and considerable energy
      consumption on both the client and the server.
      
      This memo defines a new CoAP option, State, for providing stateful
      observation on the resources of CoAP servers.  By observing the state
      of the server in terms of the Observe Option, a client can explicitly
      learn when the server will not actively reject an observation
      registration, and then can wisely performs the re-registration.  This
      avoids the potential registration flooding that causes considerable
      network overhead and energy consumption on the constrained nodes.

  "KARP KMP: Simplified Peer Authentication", Uma Chunduri, Albert Tian,
  Ari Keranen, Tero Kivinen, 2013-03-11,
  <draft-chunduri-karp-kmp-router-fingerprints-03.txt>

      This document describes the usage of Router Fingerprint
      Authentication (RFA) with public keys as a potential peer
      authentication method with KARP pair wise and group Key Management
      Protocols (KMPs).  The advantage of RFA is, it neither requires out-
      of-band, mutually agreeable symmetric keys nor a full PKI based
      system (trust anchor or CA certificates) for mutual authentication of
      peers with KARP KMP deployments.  Usage of Router Fingerprints give a
      significant operational improvement from symmetric key based systems
      and yet provide a secure authentication technique.

  "Label-based Provider-Provisioned Lawful Intercept for L3 VPNs", Shankar
  Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Vasan Srini, Bhargav Bhikkaji,
  2013-02-18, <draft-balaji-mpls-lawful-intercept-thru-label-dis-03.txt>

      In models of Single-AS and inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label
      Switching (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) Lawful
      Intercept is a key requirement. For example, MPLS-based Layer 3 VPN
      models do not have any provider provisioned methods of lawful
      intercept that are comprehensive, quick and easy to provision from
      one single point. More particularly the auto-provisioning of lawful
      intercept for all sets of streams travelling between VPN sites and
      consequent re-direction of these streams to the appropriate
      government network has not been covered without multiple instances of
      having to configure the intercept at various points in the network
      both in the Single-AS case and the Inter-Provider VPN case.
      
      In this paper, we propose a technique which uses a set of pre-defined
      labels called Lawful Intercept labels and a method for provisioning
      lawful intercept amongst the various PE devices using these labels
      both in the Single-AS and the inter-provider VPN cases. A single
      point of action is the key to this idea. The intercepted traffic is
      mirrored on a PE or a whole set of PEs or on all the PEs
      participating in the VPN. A technique called the Domino-effect
      provisioning of these Label-based Provider Provisioned Lawful
      Intercept mechanism is also outlined.

  "A Larger Loopback Prefix for IPv6", Mark Smith, 2013-02-20,
  <draft-smith-v6ops-larger-ipv6-loopback-prefix-04.txt>

      During the development and testing of a network application, it can
      be useful to run multiple instances of the application using the same
      transport layer protocol port on the same development host, while
      also having network access to the application instances limited to
      the local host.  Under IPv4, this has commonly been possible by using
      different loopback addresses within 127/8.  It is not possible under
      IPv6, as the loopback prefix of ::1/128 only provides a single
      loopback address.  This memo proposes a new larger loopback prefix
      that will provide many IPv6 loopback addresses.  The processing rules
      for this new larger loopback prefix also allow sending or forwarding
      of packets containing these addresses beyond the originating router
      under certain circumstances.

  "Information Model for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs) with
  Impairments Validation", Giovanni Martinelli, Xian Zhang, Gabriele
  Galimberti, Andrea Zanardi, Domenico Siracusa, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-martinelli-ccamp-wson-iv-info-02.txt>

      This document defines an information model to support Impairment-
      Aware (IA) Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) function.  This
      operation might be required in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks
      (WSON) that already support RWA and the information model defined
      here goes in addition and it is fully compatible with the already
      defined information model for impairment-free RWA process in WSON.
      
      This information model shall support all control plane architectural
      options defined for WSON with impairment validation.

  "Information Encoding for WSON with Impairments Validation", Giovanni
  Martinelli, Andrea Zanardi, Xian Zhang, Gabriele Galimberti, Domenico
  Siracusa, 2013-07-13, <draft-martinelli-ccamp-wson-iv-encode-02.txt>

      Impairment-Aware (IA) Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA)
      function might be required in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks
      (WSON) that already support RWA.  This document defines proper
      encoding to support this operation.  It goes in addition to the
      available impairment-free WSON encoding and it is fully compatible
      with it.
      
      As the information model, the encoding is independent from control
      plane architectures and protocol implementations.  Its definitions
      can be used in related protocol extensions.

  "IPv6 Home Network Naming Delegation", Daniel Migault, Wouter Cloetens,
  Chris Griffiths, Ralf Weber, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation-02.txt,.pdf>

      CPEs are designed to provide IP connectivity to home networks.  Most
      CPEs assigns IP addresses to the nodes of the home network which
      makes it a good candidate for hosting the naming service.  With IPv6,
      the naming service makes nodes reachable from the home network as
      well as from the Internet.
      
      However, CPEs have not been designed to host such a naming service.
      More specifically, CPE have been designed neither to host a service
      exposed on the Internet, nor to support heavy operations like zone
      signing.  Both MAY expose the CPEs to resource exhaustion which would
      make the home network unreachable, and most probably would also
      affect the home network inner communications.
      
      In addition, DNSSEC management and configuration may not be well
      understood or mastered by regular end users.  Misconfiguration MAY
      also results in naming service disruption, thus these end users MAY
      prefer to rely on third party naming providers.
      
      This document describes a homenet naming architecture where the CPEs
      manage the DNS zone associates to its home network, and outsource
      both DNSSEC management and naming service on the Internet to a third
      party designated as the Public Authoritative Servers.

  "A Media-based Traceroute Function for the Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP)", Hadriel Kaplan, 2013-06-15,
  <draft-kaplan-straw-sip-traceroute-01.txt>

      SIP already provides the ability to perform hop-by-hop traceroute
      for SIP messages using the Max-Forwards header field, in order to
      determine the reachability path of requests to a target.  A
      mechanism for media-loopback calls has also been defined separately,
      which enables test calls to be generated which result in media being
      looped back to the originator.  This document describes a means of
      performing hop-by-hop traceroute-style test calls using the media-
      loopback mechanism, in order to test the media path when SIP
      sessions go through media-relaying B2BUAs.

  "Loop Detection Mechanisms for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
  Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs)", Hadriel Kaplan, Victor Pascual,
  2013-02-25, <draft-kaplan-straw-b2bua-loop-detection-01.txt>

      SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) can cause unending SIP request
      routing loops because, as User Agent Clients, they can generate SIP
      requests with new Max-Forwards values.  This document discusses the
      difficulties associated with loop detection for B2BUAs, and
      requirements for them to prevent infinite loops.

  "Network Time Protocol: autokey Version 2 Specification", Dieter Sibold,
  Stephen Roettger, 2013-02-24, <draft-sibold-autokey-02.txt>

      This document describes a security protocol that enables
      authenticated time synchronization using Network Time Protocol (NTP).
      Autokey Version 2 obsoletes NTP autokey protocol RFC 5906 [RFC5906]
      which suffers from various security vulnerabilities.  Its design
      considers the special requirements that are related to the task of
      precise timekeeping.

  "Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs",
  Michelle Cotton, Barry Leiba, Thomas Narten, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-leiba-cotton-iana-5226bis-03.txt>

      Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants
      to identify various protocol parameters.  To ensure that the values
      used in these fields do not have conflicting uses, and to promote
      interoperability, their allocation is often coordinated by a central
      authority.  For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet
      Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
      
      To make assignments in a given namespace prudently, IANA needs
      guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be
      assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values
      can be made.  This document defines a framework for the documentation
      of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that
      the guidance given to IANA is clear and addresses the various issues
      that are likely in the operation of a registry.
      
      This is the third edition, and obsoletes RFC 5226.

  "ALTO Caching", Sreekanth Madhavan, Nandiraju Ravishankar, 2013-02-03,
  <draft-madhavan-alto-caching-01.txt>

      The specification of the ALTO protocol uses map based approaches
      assuming that the information provided is static for a longer period
      of time.  The purpose of this memo is to provide a mechanism where
      ALTO clients cache the map information and the servers provide the
      expiration time for invalidation.

  "ALTO Subscription", Sreekanth Madhavan, Nandiraju Ravishankar,
  2013-02-03, <draft-madhavan-alto-subscription-01.txt>

      The specification of the ALTO protocol uses map based approaches
      assuming that the information provided is static for a longer period
      of time.  But in some cases network operators reallocate IP subnets
      from time to time which in turn changes the mapping partitions[I-
      D.ietf-alto-deployments].  Since the ALTO clients are unaware of the
      map information changes, clients need to query the servers for every
      service request and many such requests are redundant because the
      information was not changed.  The purpose of this memo is to propose
      a mechanism where ALTO clients can subscribe for event notifications
      from the server

  "Request For Action to Establish an Enhanced Cooperation Task Force and
  a Preparatory Working-Group", Norbert Bollow, 2013-02-13,
  <draft-bollow-ectf-06.txt>

      This memo calls for the creation of a new governance forum named
      "Enhanced Cooperation Task Force" (ECTF).  The main purpose of the
      ECTF is to facilitate consensus-seeking discussions regarding
      information society governance actions that will be taken by national
      governments and international organizations.

  "Authenticated Denial of Existence in the DNS", R. Gieben, Matthijs
  Mekking, 2013-01-07, <draft-gieben-auth-denial-of-existence-dns-02.txt>

      Authenticated denial of existence allows a resolver to validate that
      a certain domain name does not exist.  It is also used to signal that
      a domain name exists, but does not have the specific RR type you were
      asking for.  When returning a negative DNSSEC response, a name server
      usually includes up to two NSEC records.  With NSEC3 this amount is
      three.  This document provides additional background commentary and
      some context for the NSEC and NSEC3 mechanisms used by DNSSEC to
      provide authenticated denial of existence responses

  "HTTP/2.0 Discussion: Stored Header Encoding", James Snell, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-snell-httpbis-bohe-11.txt>

      This memo describes a proposed alternative encoding for headers that
      combines the best concepts from the proposed Delta and HeaderDiff
      options with the typed value codecs introduced by previous versions
      of this draft.

  "Web Cache Communication Protocol V2, Revision 1", Douglas McLaggan,
  2012-08-02, <draft-mclaggan-wccp-v2rev1-00.txt>

      This document describes version 2 of the Web Cache Communication
      Protocol (WCCP).  The WCCP V2 protocol specifies interactions between
      one or more routers and one or more web-caches.  The interaction may
      take place within an IPv4 or IPv6 network.  The purpose of the
      interaction is to establish and maintain the transparent redirection
      of selected types of traffic flowing through a group of routers (or
      similar devices).  The selected traffic is redirected to a group of
      web-caches (or other traffic optimisation devices) with the aim of
      optimising resource usage and lowering response times.
      
      The protocol does not specify any interaction between the web-caches
      within a group or between a web-cache and a web-server.

  "Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) Capabilities
  Interface", Kevin Ma, 2013-02-04, <draft-ma-cdni-capabilities-01.txt>

      The interconnection of Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) is
      predicated on the ability of downstream CDNs (dCDNs) to handle end-
      user requests in a functionally equivalent manner to the upstream CDN
      (uCDN).  The uCDN must be able to assess the ability of the dCDN to
      handle individual requests.  A CDN interconnection (CDNI) interface
      is needed to facilitate the advertisement of capabilities by the dCDN
      to the uCDN.  This document describes an approach to implementing a
      CDNI capabilities advertisement interface.

  "LLCPS", Pascal Urien, 2013-07-12, <draft-urien-tls-llcp-02.txt>

      This document describes the implementation, named LLCPS, of the TLS
      protocol over the NFC (Near Field Communication) LLCP (Logical Link
      Control Protocol) layer. The NFC peer to peer (P2P) protocol may be
      used by any application that needs communication between two devices
      at very small distances (a few centimeters). LLCPS enforces a strong
      security in NFC P2P exchanges, and may be deployed for many
      services, in the Internet Of Things (IoT) ecosystem, such as
      payments, access control or ticketing operations. Applications
      secured by LLCPS are identified by the service name
      "urn:nfc:sn:tls:x" where x is the application name.

  "RPL Routing Pathology In a Network With a Mix of Nodes Operating in
  Storing and Non-Storing Modes", JeongGil Ko, Jongsoo Jeong, Jongjun
  Park, Jong Jun, Naesoo Kim, Omprakash Gnawali, 2013-02-16,
  <draft-ko-roll-mix-network-pathology-02.txt>

      The RPL specification allows nodes running with storing or non-
      storing modes to operate in the same network.  We describe how such a
      mix can result in network partitioning even when there are plenty of
      physical links available in the network.  The partitioning affects
      both upwards (nodes to root) and downwards (root to leaf) traffic.
      This routing pathology stems from a recommendation made in the RPL
      specification forcing nodes with different modes of operation to join
      the RPL network as leaf nodes only.  We propose a solution that
      modifies RPL by mandating that all the nodes parse and interpret
      source routing headers and storing mode nodes to sometimes act like a
      non-storing mode root by attaching source routing headers.

  "An Architecture for splicing TE-LSPs in Hierarchical CsC scenarios",
  Bhargav Bhikkaji, Balaji Venkataswami, Shankar Raman, Gaurav Raina,
  2013-02-25, <draft-balaji-mpls-csc-te-lsp-splice-02.txt>

      Hierarchical Carrier Supporting Carrier deployments involve a Carrier
      Core which hereinafter is called the Tier-1 provider and two or more
      VPN sites that are carriers themselves hereinafter called Tier-2
      providers that offer MPLS VPN services to their own customers. In
      such cases normally LDP is used to distribute labels amongst the
      routers (P and PE devices) in the Tier-2 provider's sites. When RSVP
      based TE-LSPs are constructed to explicitly route traffic for Tier-2
      ISP's customers from the Tier-2 PEs to the CE of the Tier-1 provider
      and such TE-LSPs exist on multiple sites of the Tier-2 provider, the
      Tier-2 ISP may require splicing together through an "auto-match-and-
      splice-together" facility such that traffic flows from the PE of the
      Tier-2 ISP through the TE-LSP onto the CE of the Tier-1 ISP and then
      onto the other site and takes a path through a specific TE-LSP from
      the CE of the other site to the destination Tier-2 PE and then onto
      the final customer.
      
      This solution offers a lot of advantages such as providing adequate
      assurance that the bandwidth for the traffic flowing through these
      spliced TE-LSPs is met. It also provides a explicit routing of the
      traffic rather than through the regular LDP (which follows IGP)
      scenarios. Such explicitly routed TE-LSPs would have been constructed
      taking into account factors such as using under-utilized links for
      example. Splicing together these TE-LSPs in various sites and doing
      the splicing on an auto-match based on bandwidth or delay metrics
      would be a good service to offer to the Tier-2 ISPs customers.
      
      This draft outlines a scheme that offers such a feature and service
      to the Tier-2 ISPs through the addition of certain additional label
      exchanges and some additional labels such as the RSVP-stitch label
      and the RSVP-splicing-LDP label in the label stack which can be used
      to splice together these tunnels. In case of re-optimization of the
      LSP end-to-end there is a wide variety of choices for the near-end PE
      to hook up with a suitable far-end tunnel in the other Tier-2 site.
      
      Explicit tunnel setup can be obviated by merely choosing from a set
      of already constructed tunnels based on criterion that may involve
      various parameters. Also fast-reroute in case of remote tunnel
      failure is taken care of.

  "SNMP based Provider-Provisioned label for Lawful Intercept in L3 VPNs",
  Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Vasan Srini, Bhargav
  Bhikkaji, 2013-02-18, <draft-balaji-mpls-li-thru-label-dis-snmp-01.txt>

      In models of Single-AS and inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label
      Switching (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) Lawful
      Intercept is a key requirement. For example, MPLS-based Layer 3 VPN

      both in the Single-AS case and the Inter-Provider VPN case.
      
      In this paper, we propose a technique which uses a set of pre-defined
      labels called Lawful Intercept labels and a method for provisioning
      lawful intercept amongst the various PE devices using these labels
      both in the Single-AS and the inter-provider VPN cases. A single
      point of action is the key to this idea. The intercepted traffic is
      mirrored on a PE or a whole set of PEs or on all the PEs
      participating in the VPN. A technique called the Domino-effect
      provisioning of these Label-based Provider Provisioned Lawful
      Intercept mechanism is also outlined. This differs from [1] in that
      there is explicit use of a secure SNMP mechanism to provision the
      labels for Lawful Intercept at the various PEs instead of a MP-BGP
      update.

  "Babel HMAC Cryptographic Authentication", Denis Ovsienko, 2013-04-18,
  <draft-ovsienko-babel-hmac-authentication-03.txt,.pdf>

      This document describes a cryptographic authentication mechanism for
      Babel routing protocol, updating, but not superceding RFC 6126.  The
      mechanism allocates two new TLV types for the authentication data,
      uses HMAC and is both optional and backward compatible.

  "The Open vSwitch Database Management Protocol", Ben Pfaff, Bruce Davie,
  2013-03-15, <draft-pfaff-ovsdb-proto-02.txt>

      Open vSwitch is an open source software switch designed to be used as
      a vswitch (virtual switch) in virtualized server environments.  A
      vswitch forwards traffic between different virtual machines (VMs) on
      the same physical host and also forwards traffic between VMs and the
      physical network.  Open vSwitch is open to programmatic extension and
      control using OpenFlow and the OVSDB (Open vSwitch Database)
      management protocol.  This document defines the OVSDB management
      protocol.

  "IMAP Extension for Incremental Threading (INCTHREAD)", Jan Kundrat,
  2013-02-25, <draft-kundrat-incthread-01.txt>

      This document describes the INCTHREAD IMAP extension which enables
      clients to retrieve incremental updates of the mailbox threading.
      The extension repurposes the ESEARCH response for passing along the
      threading information and builds on top of Arnt Gulbrandsen's work on
      the INTHREAD search key.  The UID THREAD command is also extended to
      allow activating this extension.  Together, these changes make it
      possible for clients not to fetch the complete mailbox threading each
      time a new message arrives.

  "Resolution Constraints in Web Real Time Communications", Harald

  "Resource-Oriented Lightweight Indicator Exchange", John Field,
  2013-02-15, <draft-field-mile-rolie-01.txt>

      This document defines a resource-oriented approach to cyber security
      information sharing.  Using this approach, a CSIRT or other
      stakeholder may share and exchange representations of cyber security
      incidents, indicators, and other related information as Web-
      addressable resources.  The transport protocol binding is specified
      as HTTP(S) with a MIME media type of Atom+XML.  An appropriate set of
      link relation types specific to cyber security information sharing is
      defined.  The resource representations leverage the existing IODEF
      [RFC5070] and RID [RFC6545] specifications as appropriate.
      Coexistence with deployments that conform to existing specifications
      including RID [RFC6545] and Transport of Real-time Inter-network
      Defense (RID) Messages over HTTP/TLS [RFC6546] is supported via
      appropriate use of HTTP status codes.

      later.

  "RRCP A Receiver-Driven and Router-Feedback Congestion Control Protocol
  for ICN", Mingwei Xu, Chunmei Xia, 2013-03-14, <draft-xu-rrcp-01.txt>

      Network requirements have evolved from data communications between
      two hosts to large-scale information access through networks. The
      current Internet employs an address-centric network communication
      model, which is efficient for communications between hosts, but not
      efficient for communications between a host and a network. Given
      this fact, Information-centric Networking (ICN) has become a hot
      spot to meet the new requirement.  In ICN there exists a congestion
      problem which hasn't been well solved. We provide a new congestion
      control protocol, RRCP, since the congestion control protocols in IP
      networks are not suitable for ICN transport.  RRCP, with XCP and ICN
      transport characteristics, advances a receiver-driven and router-
      feedback mechanism.  RRCP can stay efficient, fair and stable via
      the validation of simulation.

  "Applicability of MPLS-TP Linear protection for p2mp", Guoman Liu,
  2013-03-13, <draft-liu-mpls-tp-p2mp-linear-protection-01.txt>

      In MPLS-TP requirement document(rfc5654), there is a requirement to
      support 1+1 and 1:n protection for p2mp connectivity.  The
      requirement was described in MPLS-TP Survivability Framework
      document(RFC 6372) and draft-ietf-mpls-tp-p2mp-framework.  The basic
      protocol for linear protection was specified in the MPLS-TP Linear
      Protection document [RFC 6378] but is limited to 1+1 and 1:1
      protection for p2p connectivity.  in addtion, The 1:N protection in
      which all of working transport paths and the protection path have the
      same end points was specified in MPLS-TP 1:N protection document
      (draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection).This document applies the
      existing PSC(RFC 6378) and extensive PSC protocol(draft-ietf-mpls-tp-
      1toN-protection) to support scenarios of protecting the p2mp path by
      extending the existing p2p linear protection mechanism.  .
      
      
      This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
      Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
      Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include
      an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
      to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
      network as defined by the ITU-T.

  "ENUM Service Registration for acct URI", Laurent Goix, Kepeng Li,
  2013-05-06, <draft-goix-appsawg-enum-acct-uri-02.txt>

      This document registers a Telephone Number Mapping (ENUM) service for
      'acct:' URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).

  "The Key HTTP Response Header Field", Roy Fielding, Mark Nottingham,
  2013-02-18, <draft-fielding-http-key-02.txt>

      The 'Key' header field for HTTP responses allows an origin server to
      describe the cache key for a negotiated response: a short algorithm
      that can be used upon later requests to determine if the same
      response is reusable.
      
      Key has the advantage of avoiding an additional round trip for
      validation whenever a new request differs slightly, but not
      significantly, from prior requests.
      
      Key also informs user agents of the request characteristics that
      might result in different content, which can be useful if the user
      agent is not sending Accept* fields in order to reduce the risk of
      fingerprinting.

  "SCIM and vCard mapping", Bert Greevenbosch, 2013-02-24,

  "Experience from MAP-T Testing", Edwin Cordeiro, Rodrigo Carnier,
  Antonio Moreiras, 2013-03-26,
  <draft-cordeiro-softwire-experience-mapt-01.txt>

      This document describes the testing result of a network using MAP-T
      dual translation solution, by providing an overview of user
      applications' behavior with a shared IPv4 address.
      
      The MAP-T software is from CERNET Center and the test environment is
      on NIC.br network with real and virtualized machines.

  "Retrieving the Capabilities of a PCP-controlled Device", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Tirumaleswar Reddy, 2013-05-30,
  <draft-boucadair-pcp-capability-02.txt>

      This document extends Port Control Protocol (PCP) with the ability to
      retrieve the capabilities of PCP-controlled device: CAPABILITY
      Option.

  "IP/MPLS Connectivity Provisioning Profile", Mohamed Boucadair,
  Christian Jacquenet, Ning Wang, 2012-09-25,
  <draft-boucadair-connectivity-provisioning-profile-02.txt>

      This document describes the Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP)
      and proposes a CPP Template to capture IP connectivity requirements
      to be met in the context of delivery of services (e.g.  Voice over IP
      or IP TV) which are to be plugged upon an IP/MPLS infrastructure.
      The CPP defines the set of IP transfer parameters to be supported by
      the underlying IP/MPLS transport network together with a reachability
      scope and bandwidth/capacity needs.  Appropriate performance metrics
      such as one-way delay, one-way delay variation are used to
      characterize an IP transfer service.  Both global and restricted
      reachability scopes can be captured in the CPP.
      
      Having the generic CPP template allows for (1) automating the process
      of service negotiation and activation, thus accelerating service
      provisioning, (2) setting the (traffic) objectives of Traffic
      Engineering functions and service management functions and (3)
      enriching service and network management systems with 'decision-
      making' capabilities based on negotiated/offered CPPs.

  "MIF API for Connection Management", Pierrick Seite, Juan Zuniga,
  2013-02-22, <draft-seite-mif-cm-01.txt>

      There is currently a need to present a coherent connection management
      behaviour for different terminal platforms (e.g. mobile phones, PCs,
      tablets, etc.).  This document discusses how a connection manager can
      use the MIF API to provide this coherent behaviour and enhance the
      end user's experience when a terminal is able to connect to multiple
      interfaces.  The goal of this document is not to define a connection
      manager specification, but to focus on the interaction with the MIF
      API and suggest relevant generic messages for the interface.
      
      This document is for discussion and its intention is to help
      clarifying the utilization of the MIF API in a connection management
      context and propose some relevant considerations.

  "Design Discussion and Comparison of Replay-Attack Protection Mechanisms
  for BGPSEC", Kotikalapudi Sriram, Doug Montgomery, 2013-03-24,
  <draft-sriram-replay-protection-design-discussion-01.txt>

      The BGPSEC protocol requires a method for protection from replay
      attacks, at least to control the window of exposure.  In the context
      of BGPSEC, a replay attack occurs when an adversary suppresses a
      prefix withdrawal (implicit or explicit) or replays a previously
      received BGPSEC announcement for a prefix that has since been
      withdrawn.  This informational document provides design discussion
      and comparison of multiple alternative replay-attack protection
      mechanisms weighing their pros and cons.  It is meant to be a
      companion document to the standards track I-D.-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-
      rollover that will specify a method to be used with BGPSEC for
      replay-attack protection.

  "Autonomous System (AS) Migration Features and Their Effects on the BGP
  AS_PATH Attribute", Wesley George, Shane Amante, 2013-07-10,
  <draft-ga-idr-as-migration-02.txt>

      This draft discusses common methods of managing an ASN migration
      using some BGP feaures that while commonly-used are not formally part
      of the BGP4 protocol specification and may be vendor-specific in
      exact implementation.  It is necessary to document these de facto
      standards to ensure that they are properly supported in BGPSec.

  "Mechanisms for Optimal LAG/ECMP Component Link Utilization in
  Networks", ramki, Sanjay Khanna, Lucy Yong, Anoop Ghanwani, So Ning,
  Bhumip Khasnabish, 2013-04-24,
  <draft-krishnan-opsawg-large-flow-load-balancing-08.txt>

      Demands on networking infrastructure are growing exponentially; the
      drivers are bandwidth hungry rich media applications, inter-data
      center communications, etc. In this context, it is important to
      optimally use the bandwidth in wired networks that extensively use
      LAG/ECMP techniques for bandwidth scaling. This draft explores some
      of the mechanisms useful for achieving this.

  "CoAP Minimum Request Interval", Bert Greevenbosch, 2013-04-26,
  <draft-greevenbosch-core-minimum-request-interval-01.txt>

      This document defines an "Minimum-Request-Interval" option for CoAP,
      which can be used to negotiate the minimum time between two
      subsequent requests within a single client and server pair.  It can
      be used for flow and congestion control, reducing the consumption of
      server and network resources when needed.
      
      Note
      
      Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should
      be sent to core@ietf.org.

  "Multihoming in Homenet", Wassim Haddad, Damien Saucez, 2013-03-29,
  <draft-haddad-homenet-multihomed-01.txt>

      So far, multihoming in Homenet must be supported by the hosts as
      there is no mean to use simultaneously the different ISPs of the
      Homenet without risking flow disruption.  In this memo, we propose to
      revise the way multihoming is conceived in Homenet by relying on the
      infrastructure instead of the hosts.  We also propose a high level
      solution that answers this particular problem.

  "Making BGP filtering a habit: Impact on policies", Camilo Cardona,
  Pierre Francois, 2013-07-09, <draft-cardona-filtering-threats-02.txt>

      Network operators define their BGP policies based on the business
      relationships that they maintain with their peers.  By limiting the
      propagation of BGP prefixes, an autonomous system avoids the
      existence of flows between BGP peers that do not provide any
      economical gain.  This draft describes how undesired flows can emerge
      in autonomous systems due to the filtering of overlapping BGP
      prefixes by neighboring domains.

  "Multiple Synchronization Sources (SSRC) in SDP Media Descriptions",
  Christer Holmberg, Magnus Westerlund, BoB, Fredrik Jansson, 2013-03-27,
  <draft-westerlund-mmusic-max-ssrc-01.txt>

      This document describes use-cases where endpoints, for a given media
      type, use multiple media sources.  It also describes how endpoints
      normally support media sources, and limitations associated with the
      support of multiple sources.
      
      This document also defines two new SDP attributes, "max-send-ssrc"
      and "max-recv-ssrc".  The attributes allows an entity to, for a given
      media description, indicate sending and receiving capabilities of
      multiple media sources, based on codec usage .

  "NFSv4 Multi-Domain FedFS Requirements", Andy Adamson, Nico Williams,
  2013-04-17, <draft-adamson-nfsv4-multi-domain-federated-fs-reqs-02.txt>

      This document describes constraints to the NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1
      protocols as well as the use of multi-domain capable file systems,
      name resolution services, and security services required to fully
      enable a multi-domain NFSv4 federated file system.

  "An XML Schema for the CLUE data model", Roberta Presta, Simon Romano,

      This document provides an XML schema file for the definition of CLUE
      data model types.

  "Use of the Prefer Header Field in Web Distributed Authoring and
  Versioning (WebDAV)", Kenneth Murchison, 2013-05-17,
  <draft-murchison-webdav-prefer-03.txt>

      This specification defines how the HTTP Prefer header can be used by
      a WebDAV client to request that certain behaviors be employed by a
      server while constructing a response to a successful request.

  "Abstract", Ahmed Bashandy, Clarence Filsfils, Prodosh Mohapatra,
  2013-03-29, <draft-rtgwg-bgp-pic-01.txt>

      In the network comprising thousands of iBGP peers exchanging millions
      of routes, many routes are reachable via more than one path. Given
      the large scaling targets, it is desirable to restore traffic after
      failure in a time period that does not depend on the number of BGP
      prefixes. In this document we proposed a technique by which traffic
      can be re-routed to ECMP or pre-calculated backup paths in a
      timeframe that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. The
      objective is achieved through organizing the forwarding chains in a
      hierarchical manner and sharing forwarding elements among the maximum
      possible number of routes. The proposed technique achieves prefix
      independent convergence while ensuring incremental deployment,
      complete transparency and automation, and zero management and
      provisioning effort

  "Loop Free DODAG Local Repair", Jianlin Guo, Philip Orlik, Ghulam
  Bhatti, 2013-04-02, <draft-guo-roll-loop-free-dodag-repair-01.txt>

      IETF has been developing IPv6 based standards for Low-power and Lossy
      Networks (LLNs) to meet requirements of constrained applications,
      such as field monitoring, inventory control and so on. IPv6 Routing
      Protocol for LLNs (RPL) has been published in [RFC6550]. Based on
      routing metrics and constraints [RFC6551], RPL builds Directed
      Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology to establish bidirectional routes for
      LLNs for traffic types of multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint,
      and point-to-point. RPL routes are optimized for traffic to or from
      one or more roots that act as sinks. As a result, a DAG is
      partitioned into one or more Destination Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), one
      DODAG per sink. RPL is widely considered as a feasible routing
      protocol for LLNs. However, DODAG loops caused by local DODAG repair
      mechanism is an issues to be addressed. This draft introduces a loop
      free local DODAG repair mechanism. This draft also introduces a
      piggybacked data option for transferring delay sensitive data during
      route repair process. The piggybacked data can be included in DODAG
      Repair Request (DRQ) message or DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS)
      message.

  "ForCES Model Extension", Evangelos Haleplidis, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-haleplidis-forces-model-extension-04.txt>

      Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an
      architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize
      information exchange between the control plane and the forwarding
      plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES NE).  RFC5812 has defined
      the ForCES Model provides a formal way to represent the capabilities,
      state, and configuration of forwarding elements within the context of
      the ForCES protocol, so that control elements (CEs) can control the
      FEs accordingly.  More specifically, the model describes the logical
      functions that are present in an FE, what capabilities these
      functions support, and how these functions are or can be
      interconnected.
      
      RFC5812 has been around for two years and experience in its use has
      shown room for small extensions without a need to alter the protocol
      while retaining backward compatibility with older xml libraries.
      This document extends the model to allow complex datatypes for
      metadata, optional default values for datatypes and optional access
      types for structures.  The document also introduces three new
      features, bitmap as a new datatype, a new event condition
      BecomesEqualTo and LFB properties.

  "A Mechanism for Diameter Overload Control", Adam Roach, Eric McMurry,
  2013-05-17, <draft-roach-dime-overload-ctrl-03.txt>

      When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be
      able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to
      reduce or stop sending traffic for some period of time.  Otherwise,
      it must continue to expend resources parsing and responding to
      Diameter messages.
      
      This document proposes a concrete, application-independent mechanism
      to address the challenge of communicating load and overload state
      among Diameter peers, and specifies an algorithm for load abatement
      to address such overload conditions as they occur.  The load
      abatement algorithm is extensible, allowing for future documents to
      define additional load abatement approaches.

  "Use cases for MAP-T", Roberta Maglione, Wojciech Dec, Victor Kuarsingh,
  Edwin Mallette, 2013-06-27,
  <draft-maglione-softwire-map-t-scenarios-02.txt>

      The Softwire working group is currently discussing both encapsulation
      and translation based stateless IPv4/IPv6 solutions in order to be
      able to provide IPv4 connectivity to customers in an IPv6-Only
      environment.
      
      The purpose of this document is to describe some operational use
      cases that would benefit from a translation based approach and
      highlights the operational benefits that a translation based solution
      would allow.

  "The Diameter Overload Control Application (DOCA)", Jouni Korhonen,
  Hannes Tschofenig, 2013-02-25, <draft-korhonen-dime-ovl-01.txt>

      This specification documents a Diameter Overload Control Application
      (DOCA), which uses the normal Diameter application approach for the
      capability negotiation, propagation and management of Diameter
      overload control information between Diameter nodes.

  "Domain Subobjects for Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic
  Engineering (RSVP-TE)", Dhruv Dhody, Udayasree Palle, Venugopal
  Kondreddy, Ramon Casellas, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-dhody-ccamp-rsvp-te-domain-subobjects-02.txt>

      The Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
      specification [RFC3209] and the Generalized Multiprotocol Label
      Switching (GMPLS) extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3473] allow abstract
      nodes and resources to be explicitly included in a path setup.
      Further Exclude Routes extensions [RFC4874] allow abstract nodes and
      resources to be explicitly excluded in a path setup.
      
      This document specifies new subobjects to include or exclude domains
      during path setup where domain is a collection of network elements
      within a common sphere of address management or path computational
      responsibility (such as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an
      Autonomous System (AS)).  Note that the use of AS as an abstract node
      representing domain is already defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC4874],
      albeit with a 2-Byte AS number.

  "Happy Eyeballs Extension for ICE", Tirumaleswar Reddy, Prashanth Patil,
  Dan Wing, 2013-07-11, <draft-reddy-mmusic-ice-happy-eyeballs-01.txt>

      This document specifies requirements for algorithms that make ICE
      connectivity checks more responsive by reducing delays in dual-stack
      host ICE connectivity checks when there is a path failure for the
      address family preferred by the application or by the operating
      system.  As IPv6 is usually preferred, the procedures in this
      document helps avoid user-noticeable delays when the IPv6 path is
      broken or excessively slow.

  "The NetInf Protocol", Dirk Kutscher, Stephen Farrell, Elwyn Davies,
  2013-02-10, <draft-kutscher-icnrg-netinf-proto-01.txt>

      This document defines a conceptual protocol and corresponding node
      requirements for NetInf nodes in a NetInf network.  A NetInf network
      offers an information-centric paradigm that supports the creation,
      location, exchange and storage of Named Data Objects (NDOs).  NetInf
      nodes can provide different services to other NetInf nodes, e.g.,
      forwarding requests for information objects, delivering corresponding
      response messages, name resolution services etc.  This (abstract)
      protocol is intended to be run over some "convergence layer" that
      handles transport issues.  Two "wire" formats are defined, one that
      uses HTTP for message transfer and one layered on UDP.

  "Add 100.64.0.0/10 prefixes to IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zones Registry.",
  Mark Andrews, 2013-04-01, <draft-andrews-dnsop-rfc6598-rfc6303-02.txt>

      RFC6598 specified that: "Reverse DNS queries for Shared Address Space
      addresses [100.64.0.0/10] MUST NOT be forwarded to the global DNS
      infrastructure."
      
      This document formally directs IANA to add the associated zones to
      the "IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zones Registry" to prevent such queries
      accidently leaking to the global DNS infrastructure.

  "Modeling JSON Text with YANG", Ladislav Lhotka, 2013-04-02,
  <draft-lhotka-netmod-yang-json-01.txt>

      This document defines rules for mapping data models expressed in YANG
      to configuration and operational state data encoded as JSON text.  It
      does so by specifying a procedure for translating the subset of YANG-
      compatible XML documents to JSON text, and vice versa.

  "Parallel NFS (pNFS) Lustre Layout Operations", Sorin Faibish, Peng Tao,
  2013-05-05, <draft-faibish-nfsv4-pnfs-lustre-layout-05.txt>

      Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends Network File System version 4.1(NFSv4.1)
      to allow clients to directly access file data on the storage used by
      the NFSv4.1 server. This ability to bypass the server for data
      access can increase both performance and parallelism, but requires
      additional client functionality for data access, some of which is
      dependent on the class of storage used, a.k.a. the Layout Type. The
      main pNFS operations and data types in NFSv4 Minor version 1 specify
      a layout-type-independent layer; layout-type-specific information is
      conveyed using opaque data structures whose internal structure is
      further defined by the particular layout type specification. This
      document specifies the NFSv4.1 Lustre pNFS Layout Type as a
      companion to the main NFSv4 Minor version 1 specification.

  "IMAP4 Extensions for Quick Mailbox Resynchronization", Alexey Melnikov,
  Dave Cridland, 2013-02-13, <draft-melnikov-5162bis-01.txt>

      This document defines an IMAP4 extension, which gives an IMAP client
      the ability to quickly resynchronize any previously opened mailbox as
      part of the SELECT command, without the need for server-side state or
      additional client round-trips.  This extension also introduces a new
      response that allows for a more compact representation of a list of
      expunged messages (and always includes the Unique Identifiers (UIDs)
      expunged).

  "Mitigating IPv6 Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack Using Stateless Neighbor
  Presence Discovery", Mark Smith, 2013-02-20,
  <draft-smith-6man-mitigate-nd-cache-dos-slnd-06.txt>

      One of the functions of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery is to discover
      whether a specified neighbor is present.  During the neighbor
      presence discovery process state is created.  A node's capacity for
      this state can be intentionally exhausted to perform a denial of
      service attack, known as the "Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack".  This
      memo proposes a stateless form of neighbor presence discovery to
      prevent this Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack.

  "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Option for Port Set
  Assignment", Qiong Sun, Yiu Lee, Qi Sun, Gabor Bajko, Mohamed Boucadair,
  2013-04-10, <draft-sun-dhc-port-set-option-01.txt>

      Because of the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space, several
      techniques have been proposed to share the same IPv4 address among
      several uses.  As an alternative to introducing a level of NAT in the

  "CoRE Mirror Server", Matthieu Vial, 2013-04-10,
  <draft-vial-core-mirror-server-01.txt>

      The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) working group aims at
      realizing the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) architecture in
      a suitable form for the most constrained nodes.  Thanks to the
      Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), REST is now applicable to
      constrained networks.  However the most energy-constrained devices
      may enter sleep mode and disconnect their network link during several
      minutes to save energy, hence preventing them from acting as
      traditional web servers.  This document describes how a sleeping
      device can store resource representations in an entity called Mirror
      Server and participate in a constrained RESTful environment.

  "Advanced Stream and Sampling Framework for IPPM", Joachim Fabini, Al
  Morton, 2013-02-22, <draft-morton-ippm-2330-update-01.txt>

      To obtain repeatable results in modern networks, test descriptions
      need an expanded stream parameter framework that also augments
      aspects specified as Type-P for test packets.  This memo proposes to
      update the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework with advanced
      considerations for measurement methodology and testing.  The existing
      framework mostly assumes deterministic connectivity, and that a
      single test stream will represent the characteristics of the path
      when it is aggregated with other flows.  Networks have evolved and
      test stream descriptions must evolve with them, otherwise unexpected
      network features may dominate the measured performance.  This memo
      describes new stream parameters for both network characterization and
      support of application design using IPPM metrics.

  "ForCES Packet Parallelization", Evangelos Haleplidis, Joel Halpern,
  2013-02-23, <draft-haleplidis-forces-packet-parallelization-02.txt>

      Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an
      architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize
      information exchange between the control plane and the forwarding
      plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES NE).  RFC5812 has defined
      the ForCES Model provides a formal way to represent the capabilities,
      state, and configuration of forwarding elements within the context of
      the ForCES protocol, so that control elements (CEs) can control the
      FEs accordingly.  More specifically, the model describes the logical
      functions that are present in an FE, what capabilities these
      functions support, and how these functions are or can be
      interconnected.
      
      Many network devices support parallel packet processing.  This
      document describes how ForCES can model a network device's
      parallelization datapath.

  "PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP Setup in a Stateful PCE Model",
  Edward Crabbe, Ina Minei, Siva Sivabalan, Robert Varga, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp-02.txt>

      The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
      mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
      computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
      
      The extensions described in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] provide
      stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic
      Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP) via PCEP, for a model where
      the PCC delegates control over one or more locally configured LSPs to

  "ForCES Inter-FE LFB", DJ, Jamal Hadi Salim, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-joachimpillai-forces-interfelfb-02.txt>

      Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an
      architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize
      information exchange between the control plane and the forwarding
      plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES NE).  RFC5812 has defined
      the ForCES Model which provides a formal way to represent the
      capabilities, state, and configuration of forwarding elements(FEs)
      within the context of the ForCES protocol.  More specifically, the
      model describes the logical functions that are present in an FE, what
      capabilities these functions support, and how these functions are or
      can be interconnected.  The control elements (CEs) can control the
      FEs using the ForCES model definition.
      
      The ForCES WG charter has been extended to allow the LFB topology to
      be across FEs.  This documents describes a non-intrusive way to
      extend the LFB topology across FEs.

  "The BinaryPack1pre2 JSON-like representation format", Carsten Bormann,
  2013-02-25, <draft-bormann-apparea-bpack-01.txt>

      JSON (RFC 4627) is an extremely successful format for the
      representation of structured information, supporting Boolean values,
      numbers, strings, arrays, and tables.  Recently, a number of
      applications have started to look for binary representation formats
      that solve a similar problem.  In particular, constrained node
      networks can benefit from such a binary representation format.
      
      A very successful binary representation that is otherwise comparable
      to JSON is MessagePack.  Recently, a number of implementations have
      modified or extended MessagePack such that it allows for
      distinguishing UTF-8 strings from binary data.  Further discussion on
      the MessagePack repository has resulted in proposals how to integrate
      such an addition back into the MessagePack community.
      
      This draft, as an independent effort, documents one such format,
      tentatively calling it BinaryPack1pre2 while the MessagePack
      extension proposals make their way through the MessagePack community.
      
      The current version -01 of this document is a snapshot that
      demonstrates a general direction.  The details may change in future
      versions based on the development of the MessagePack specification.

  "Efficiency aware IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Optimizations", Samita
  Chakrabarti, Erik Nordmark, Pascal Thubert, Margaret Wasserman,
  2013-07-15, <draft-chakrabarti-nordmark-6man-efficient-nd-02.txt>

      IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) protocol has been designed for
      neighbor's address resolution, unreachability detection, address
      autoconfiguration, router advertisement and solicitation.  With the
      progress of Internet adoption on various industries including home,
      wireless, M2M and cellular networks there is a desire for optimizing
      the legacy IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol.  This document describes
      a method of optimization by reducing multicast messages and
      introducing an IPv6 address Registration mechanism.  Efficient IPv6
      Neighbor Discovery protocol is useful for energy-efficient and low-
      power IPv6 networks and as well as Data Center and Home Networks.
      The solution is capable of handling existing legacy IPv6 nodes in the
      network with local mobility.

  "Requirements for DNS-SD/mDNS Extensions", Kerry Lynn, Stuart Cheshire,
  2013-07-15, <draft-lynn-mdnsext-requirements-02.txt>

      DNS-SD/mDNS is widely used today for discovery and resolution of
      services and names on a local link, but there are use cases to extend
      DNS-SD/mDNS to enable service discovery beyond the local link.  This
      document provides a problem statement and a list of requirements.

  "Network Virtualization Overlay Architecture", Roland Schott, Wenson Wu,
  2013-02-18, <draft-fw-nvo3-server2vcenter-01.txt>

      Multiple virtual machines (VMs) created in a single physical platform
      Or vServer greatly improve the efficiency of data centers by enabling
      more work from less hardware.  Multiple vServer and associated
      virtual machines work together as one cluster make good use of
      resources of each vServer that are scattered into different data
      centers or vServers.  VMs have their lifecycles from VM creation, VM
      Power on to VM Power off and VM deletion.  The VMs may also move
      across the participating virtualization hosts (e.g., the
      virtualization server, hypervisor).  This document discusses how VMs,
      vServers and overlay network are managed by leveraging control plane
      function and management plane function and desired signaling
      functionalities for Network Virtualization Overlay.

  "Industrial Deterministic Routing Extension for Low-Power and Lossy
  Networks", Min Wei, Heng Wang, Ping Wang, Chao Zhou, 2013-04-15,
  <draft-wei-roll-scheduling-routing-02.txt>

      Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have unique characteristics
      compared with traditional wired and ad-hoc networks. Deterministic
      networks is specified in IEEE 802.15.4e which is for deterministic
      applications in the industrial environment. Some routing metrics
      and constraints has been described in [RFC6551],[RFC5867] [RFC5826],
      [RFC5673], and [RFC5548]. There are several special characteristics
      and requirements in the industrial environment. This document
      defines a new Link Metric/Constraint Object-Scheduling Waiting
      Time to make RPL support deterministic scheduling mechanism, which
      could improve the determinacy and reliability of the LLNs in
      industrial environment.

  "EXI Messaging Requirements", Yusuke Doi, 2013-02-24,
  <draft-doi-exi-messaging-requirements-01.txt>

      EXI (Efficient XML Interchange) is a specification on efficient
      encoding of XML.  EXI is useful if an application requires XML based
      message exchange but no sufficient resource is available.  However,
      schema-informed mode of EXI needs some out-of-band coordination
      between communicating nodes.  This document discusses requirement on
      use of schema-informed EXI as a message exchange format on the
      Internet systems.

  "The (Real) Internet Key Exchange", Dan Harkins, 2013-04-12,

      memo defines a new version (v3) of the Internet Key Exchange that
      attempts to do so.

  "Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol For Fast Reroute of
  Bidirectional Co-routed Traffic Engineering LSPs", Mike Taillon, Cisco
  Systems, Rakesh Gandhi, Zafar Ali, Manav Bhatia, Lizhong Jin, Frederic
  JOUNAY, 2013-04-26,
  <draft-tsaad-ccamp-rsvpte-bidir-lsp-fastreroute-01.txt>

      This document defines RSVP-TE signaling extensions to support Fast
      Reroute (FRR) of bidirectional co-routed Traffic Engineering (TE)
      LSPs. These extensions enable the re-direction of bi-directional
      traffic and signaling onto bypass tunnels that ensure co-routedness
      of data and signaling paths in the forward and reverse directions
      after FRR. In addition, the RSVP-TE signaling extensions allow the
      coordination of bypass tunnel assignment protecting a common facility
      in both forward and reverse directions prior to or post failure
      occurrence.

  "Router Key PDU for RPKI-Router Protocol", Randy Bush, Keyur Patel, Sean
  Turner, 2013-04-08, <draft-ymbk-rpki-rtr-keys-01.txt>

      The RPKI/Router Protocol v0 is specified to carry the PDUs necessary
      for RPKI-based Origin Validation.  For BGPsec Path Validation, the
      routers also need data extracted from BGPsec Router Certificates.
      This document adds a PDU to the RPKI/Router Protocol to carry those
      data.

  "Header Delta-Compression for HTTP/2.0", Roberto Peon, 2013-03-18,

      This document describes a mechanism for compressing streams of groups
      of key-value pairs, often known as Headers in an HTTP session.  See
      RFC 2616 [RFC2616] or successors for more information about headers.

  "URI Signing for CDN Interconnection (CDNI)", Kent Leung, Francois Le
  Faucheur, Bill Downey, Ray van Brandenburg, Scott Leibrand, 2013-05-31,
  <draft-leung-cdni-uri-signing-02.txt>

      This document describes how the concept of URI signing supports the
      content access control requirements of CDNI and proposes a candidate
      URI signing scheme.
      
      The proposed URI signing method specifies the information needed to
      be included in the URI and the algorithm used to authorize and to
      validate access request for the content referenced by the URI.  Some
      of the information may be accessed by the CDN via configuration or
      CDNI metadata.

  "Encoding of Time Intervals for the TCP Timestamp Option", Richard
  Scheffenegger, Mirja Kuehlewind, Brian Trammell, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-trammell-tcpm-timestamp-interval-01.txt>

      The TCP Timestamp option would be useful for additional measurements
      if it could be assumed that the interval between ticks of the
      timestamp clock are regular, and if that interval were known.  In
      practice, many implementations do use a timestamp clock source that
      has a regular interval.  This draft specifies a compact encoding for
      exposing the timestamp interval to a receiver, and discusses
      applications therefor.

  "P-Charge-Info - A Private Header (P-Header) Extension to the Session
  Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Dan York, Tolga Asveren, 2013-03-15,
  <draft-york-dispatch-p-charge-info-01.txt>

      This text documents 'P-Charge-Info', an existing private Session
      Initiation Protocol (SIP) header (P-header) used to convey billing
      information about the party to be charged.  This P-Header is
      currently in production usage by a number of equipment vendors and
      carriers and this document is submitted to request the registration
      of this header with IANA. This P-Header may also be used in some
      situations to carry the ISUP Charge Number parameter for PSTN
      interconnection.
      
      NOTE: This document has been in development since 2008 under the name
      draft-york-sipping-p-charge-info.  This -01 document is identical to
      draft-york-sipping-p-charge-info-15 except for edits to the text to
      indicate this is now for the DISPATCH working group as the SIPPING
      working group no longer exists.

  "Network Performance Measurement for IPsec", Yang Cui, Emily Bi, Kostas
  Pentikousis, 2013-02-25, <draft-bi-ippm-ipsec-01.txt>

      IPsec is a mature technology with several interoperable
      implementations.  Indeed, the use of IPsec tunnels is increasingly
      gaining popularity in several deployment scenarios, not the least in
      what used to be solely areas of traditional telecommunication
      protocols.  Wider deployment calls for mechanisms and methods that
      enable tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure one-way and
      two-way network performance.  Unfortunately, however, standard IP
      performance measurement security mechanisms cannot be readily used
      with IPsec.  This document makes the case for employing IPsec to
      protect O/TWAMP and proposes a method which combines IKEv2 and
      O/TWAMP as defined in RFC 4656 and RFC 5357, respectively.  This
      specification aims, on the one hand, to ensure that O/TWAMP can be
      secured, while on the other hand, it extends the applicability of
      O/TWAMP to networks that have already deployed IPsec.

  "Use Cases for an Interface to BGP Protocol", Keyur Patel, Rex Fernando,
  Hannes Gredler, Shane Amante, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-keyupate-irs-bgp-usecases-02.txt>

      A network routing protocol like BGP is typically configured and
      results of its operation are analyzed through some form of Command
      Line Interface (CLI) or NETCONF.  These interactions to control BGP
      and diagnose its operation encompass: configuration of protocol
      parameters, display of protocol data, setting of certain protocol
      state and debugging of the protocol.
      
      Interface to the Routing System's (IRS) Programmatic interfaces, as
      defined in [I-D.ward-irs-framework], provides an alternate way to
      control the configuration and diagnose the operation of the BGP
      protocol.  IRS may be used for the configuration, manipulation,
      polling or analyzing protocol data.  This document describes set of
      use cases for which IRS can be used for BGP protocol.  It is intended
      to provide a base for the solution draft describing a set of
      interfaces to the BGP protocol.

  "Service Advertisement using BGP", Keyur Patel, Jan Medved, Burjiz
  Pithawala, 2013-04-26, <draft-keyupate-bgp-services-02.txt>

      A variety of services, such as NATs, firewalls, or caches, can be
      embedded in a service provider network or instantiated in data
      centers attached to the network.  This document proposes extensions
      to BGP that facilitate discovery of such service instances by
      interested clients and allows dissemination of service information,
      such as services capabilities or capacities, thoughtout the network
      domain.  The proposed extensions allow for optimal routing of
      requests to service instances that can optimally serve them.

  "Performance Monitoring Analysis for L3VPN", Lianshu Zheng, Zhenbin Li,
  Bhavani Parise, 2013-04-17, <draft-zheng-l3vpn-pm-analysis-01.txt>

      To perform the measurement of packet loss, delay and other metrics on
      a particular VPN flow, the egress PE need to tell to which specific
      ingress VRF a packet belongs to.  But for L3VPN, multipoint-to-point
      or multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) network model applies, flow
      identifying is a big challenge.  This document summarizes the current
      performance monitoring mechanisms for MPLS networks, and analyzes the
      challenge for L3VPN performance monitoring.  This document also
      discuss the key points need to be taken in consideration when
      designing L3VPN performance monitoring mechanisms.

  "A Framework for L3VPN Performance Monitoring", Jie Dong, Zhenbin Li,
  Bhavani Parise, 2013-04-17, <draft-dong-l3vpn-pm-framework-01.txt>

      The capability of BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (L3VPN)
      performance monitoring (PM) is important to meet the Service Level
      Agreement(SLA) for the service beared.  Since multipoint-to-point or
      multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) network model applies, flow
      identifying is a big challenge for L3VPN PM.  This document specifies
      the framework and mechanisms for the application of L3VPN PM.

  "Requirements for Power Aware Network", Jie Dong, Mingui Zhang, Beichuan
  Zhang, Mohamed Boucadair, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-dong-panet-requirement-01.txt>

      Energy consumption of networks is rising fast, which results in the
      increase of network operational costs.  There are emerging demands
      from operators for power-aware networking (PANET) which could
      adaptively reduce the network energy consumption when possible.  This
      document presents the requirements which should be considered in
      building a power aware network.

  "Use Cases for Power-Aware Networks", Mingui Zhang, Jie Dong, Beichuan
  Zhang, Bithika Khargharia, 2013-02-07,
  <draft-zhang-panet-use-cases-02.txt>

      Power Aware NETwork (PANET) has attracted strong interest from both
      carriers and vendors. Several use cases are investigated in this
      document to exhibit the potential usage of PANET in both backbone and
      data center networks.

  "VLAN Identifier option in DHCP", Chunhui Zhu, Yangwei Tu, 2013-04-17,
  <draft-zhu-dhc-vlan-id-option-01.txt>

      This document defines a new option for the Dynamic Host Configuration
      Protocol for IPv4 and IPv6.  This option can be used by the DHCP
      server to carry the VLAN identifier to the DHCP client to distinguish
      different connections in the access network.

  "STP Application of ICCP", Mingui Zhang, Huafeng Wen, 2013-05-01,
  <draft-zhang-iccp-stp-03.txt>

      Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol (ICCP) supports the inter-
      chassis redundancy mechanism which achieves high network
      availability.
      
      In this document, the PEs in a Redundant Group (RG) running ICCP are
      used to offer multi-homed connectivity to Spanning Tree Protocol
      (STP) networks. The ICCP TLVs for the STP application are defined,
      therefore PEs from the RG can make use of these TLVs to synchronize
      the state and configuration data.

  "Analysis of Semantic Embedded IPv6 Address Schemas", Sheng Jiang, Qiong
  Sun, Ian Farrer, Yang Bo, Tianle Yang, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-jiang-v6ops-semantic-prefix-04.txt>

      This informational document discusses the use of embedded semantics
      within IPv6 address schemas.  Network operators who have large IPv6
      address space may choose to embed some semantics into their IPv6
      addressing by assigning additional significance to specific bits
      within the prefix.  By embedding semantics into IPv6 prefixes, the
      semantics of packets can be easily inspected.  This can simplify the
      packet differentiation process.  However, semantic embedded IPv6
      address schemas have their own operational cost and even potential
      pitfalls.  Some complex semantic embedded IPv6 address schemas may
      also require new technologies in addition to existing Internet
      protocols.
      
      The document aims to understand the usage of semantic embedded IPv6
      address schemas, and neutrally analyze on the associated advantages,
      drawbacks and technical gaps for more complex address schemas.

  "Extension to LISP NAT Traversal Proposal", Li Cheng, Jun Wang,
  2013-07-15, <draft-cheng-lisp-nat-traversal-extension-01.txt>

      This draft specifies several special NAT traversal scenarios when two
      or more LISP Sites/MNs which locate behind the same NAT equipment
      communicate with each other.  When these LISP Sites/MNs communicate
      with each other, it may cause routing latency and will increase re-
      encapsulation load on Re-encapsulating Tunnel Routers(RTRs) based on
      existing LISP-NAT strategy.
      
      In this draft, we give detail descriptions of these scenarios.  Also
      we propose some suggestions to solve the problems.  According to our
      strategy, a new kind of message is used for RTRs to send relative
      information of Corresponding Sites/MNs to xTRs.

  "Report from the 'Smart Object Security Workshop', March 23, 2012,
  Paris, France", Johannes Gilger, Hannes Tschofenig, 2013-02-25,

      This document provides a summary of a workshop on 'Smart Object
      Security', which took place in Paris on March 23, 2012.  The main
      goal of the workshop was to allow participants to share their
      thoughts about the ability to utilize existing and widely deployed
      security mechanisms for smart objects.
      
      This report summarizes the discussions and lists the conclusions and
      recommendations to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
      community.

  "IPv6 Transition Technologies Selection using DHCP/DHCPv6", Tianle Yang,
  Qiongfang Ma, 2013-07-11, <draft-yang-v6ops-ipv6tran-select-01.txt>

      Nowadays, many IPv6 transition technologies has been proposed, such
      as Dual-Stack, DS-Lite, 6rd and so on.  An CPE may support some of
      them instead of only one.  But ISPs usually deploy just an unique
      transition technology in an area, for example, under a BRAS/SR or in
      a MAN.  So they must control all the CPEs to ues the exact transition
      tech through the CPEs' management system or configuring them before
      issuing to the customers.  Another question is that if subscriber buy
      a new CPE from supermarket to substitute the one received from the
      ISP, he may not access internet because of the wrong configuration.
      
      To solve these problems,this document defines a new DHCP/DHCPv6
      option named TRAN_TYPE which can control CPEs to select the
      appropriate IPv6 transition technology which ISP deployed instend of
      the CPEs' default configration.  This method can also solve the
      configurating problem when various CPEs work together without a
      uniform configuration in advance.

  "The eduroam architecture for network roaming", Klaas Wierenga, Stefan
  Winter, Tomasz Wolniewicz, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-wierenga-ietf-eduroam-01.txt,.pdf>

      This document describes the architecture of the eduroam service for
      federated (wireless) network access in academia.  The combination of
      802.1X, EAP and RADIUS that is used in eduroam provides a secure,
      scalable and deployable service for roaming network access.  The
      successful deployment of eduroam over the last decade in the
      educational sector may serve as an example for other sectors, hence
      this document.  In particular the initial architectural and standards
      choices and the changes that were prompted by operational experience
      are highlighted.

  "A Framework for Service-Driven Co-Routed MPLS Traffic Engineering
  LSPs", Zhenbin Li, Jie Dong, 2013-04-17,
  <draft-li-mpls-serv-driven-co-lsp-fmwk-01.txt>

      MPLS TE has been widely deployed to provide traffic engineering and
      traffic protection.  The complexity in configuration has much effect
      on the MPLS TE deployment in the large-scale network.  The document
      identifies the configuration issues for MPLS TE deployment and
      proposes a new mechanism, the service-driven mechanism, by which the
      setup of co-routed MPLS TE LSPs is triggered by the bidirectional
      service.  Then the document provides the framework for setting up
      service-driven co-routed MPLS Traffic-Engineered Label-Switched
      Paths(TE LSPs) for L2VPN and L3VPN.

  "Service Discovery in a Multiple Connection Environment: Problem
  Statement", Zehn Cao, Aaron Ding, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-cao-mif-srv-dis-ps-02.txt>

      This document analyzes the problems of service discovery in a
      multiple connection environment.  A multiple connection environment
      consists of multiple-interfaced nodes connecting to multiple networks
      or multiple provisioning domains.  Given a type of service a
      multiple-interfaced client is looking for, the discovery progress
      ought to return a correct pointer to the service instance that the
      client is able to access without trying every available channel.

  "Synchronization Layer: an Implementation Method for Energy Efficient
  Sensor Stack", Zehn Cao, Yuanchen Ma, Hui Tian, 2013-02-24,
  <draft-cao-lwig-syn-layer-01.txt>

      This document analyzes the problem of energy efficient protocol
      implementation, and proposes an energy efficient design of mulitiple
      protocols by utilizing a common shim layer to synchronize the packet
      receipt and transimission on a single node.

  Weiqiang Cheng, Lei Wang, Han Li, Kai Liu, He Jia, Fang Li, Yang Jian,
  Junfang Wang, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-cheng-mpls-tp-shared-ring-protection-01.txt>

      This document describes requirements and solutions for MPLS-TP Shared
      Ring Protection (MSRP) in the ring topology for point-to-point (P2P)
      services.  The mechanism of MSRP is illustrated and analyzed how it
      satisfies the requirements in RFC5654 for optimized ring protection.

  "Prefix Delegation extension to Neighbor Discovery protocol", Arnaud
  Kaiser, Sylvain Decremps, Nouha Oualha, Alexandru Petrescu, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-kaiser-nd-pd-01.txt,.pdf>

      This document describes an extension to the Neighbor Discovery
      protocol (ND).  The proposed extension enhances ND by providing it
      with a new option: the Prefix Delegation option (ND-PD).  ND-PD
      offers the possibility for routers on a same link to ask for or
      delegate IPv6 prefixes.

  "Use case of IPv6 prefix semantics for operators", Qiong Sun, Qiong Sun,
  Sheng Jiang, 2013-02-25, <draft-sun-semantic-usecase-02.txt>

      Embedding certain semantics into IPv6 addresses will bring a lot of
      benifits for operators to simplify network management and apply
      operations accordingly[I-D.jiang-semantic-prefix].  This memo
      illustrates the use case of semantic bits from operator's point of
      view, and provides considerations on how to design the semantic bits
      in IPv6 address.

  "Using NTP Extension Fields without Authentication", Tal Mizrahi, Danny
  Mayer, 2013-07-10, <draft-mizrahi-ntp-extension-field-02.txt>

      The Network Time Protocol Version 4 (NTPv4) defines the optional
      usage of extension fields. An extension field is an optional field
      that resides at the end of the NTP header, and can be used to add
      optional capabilities or additional information that is not conveyed
      in the standard NTP header. The current definition of extension
      fields in NTPv4 is somewhat ambiguous regarding the connection
      between extension fields and the presence of a Message Authentication
      Code (MAC). This draft clarifies the usage of extension fields in the
      presence and in the absence of a MAC, while maintaining
      interoperability with existing implementations.

  "Extension of the MLD proxy functionality to support multiple upstream
  interfaces", Luis Contreras, Carlos Bernardos, Juan Zuniga, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-contreras-multimob-multiple-upstreams-01.txt>

      This document presents different scenarios of applicability for an
      MLD proxy running more than one upstream interface. Since those
      scenarios impose different requirements on the MLD proxy with
      multiple upstream interfaces, it is important to ensure that the
      proxy functionality addresses all of them for compatibility.
      
      The purpose of this document is to define the requirements in an MLD
      proxy with multiple interfaces covering a variety of applicability
      scenarios, and to specify the proxy functionality to satisfy all of
      them.

  "Applicability of LDP Multi-Topology for Unicast Fast-reroute Using
  Maximally Redundant Trees", Zhenbin Li, Tao Chou, Quintin Zhao, Tianle
  Yang, 2013-04-26, <draft-li-rtgwg-ldp-mt-mrt-frr-02.txt>

      In this document, procedures' considerations on the applicability of
      LDP MT for unicast fast-reroute using MRT are provided.  The
      behaviors of label allocation and label forwarding entry setup with
      LDP Multi-Topology and MRT fast-reroute are described in details.
      Different application scenarios of the combining of the LDP multi-
      topology(MT) and unicast fast-reroute using Maximally Redundant
      Trees(MRT) are also analyzed.

  "A Hitchhiker's Guide to the (Datagram) Transport Layer Security
  Protocol for Smart Objects and Constrained Node Networks", Hannes
  Tschofenig, Sandeep Kumar, Sye Keoh, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-tschofenig-lwig-tls-minimal-03.txt>

      Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a widely used security protocol
      that offers communication security services at the transport layer.
      The initial design of TLS was focused on the protection of
      applications running on top of the Transmission Control Protocol
      (TCP), and was a good match for securing the Hypertext Transfer
      Protocol (HTTP).  Subsequent standardization efforts lead to the
      publication of the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol,
      which allows the re-use of the TLS security functionality and the
      payloads to be exchanged on top of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
      
      With the work on the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), as a
      specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and
      constrained networks, DTLS is a preferred communication security
      protocol.
      
      Smart objects are constrained in various ways (e.g., CPU, memory,
      power consumption) and these limitations may impose restrictions on
      the protocol stack such a device runs. This document only looks at
      the security part of that protocol stacks and the ability to
      customize TLS/DTLS. To offer input for implementers and system
      architects this document illustrates the costs and benefits of
      various TLS/DTLS features for use with smart objects and constraint
      node networks.

  "Multiple Upstream Interface Support for IGMP/MLD Proxy", Hitoshi
  Asaeda, Seil Jeon, 2013-02-25, <draft-asaeda-pim-mldproxy-multif-01.txt>

      This document describes the way of supporting multiple upstream
      interfaces for an IGMP/MLD proxy device.  The proposed extension
      enables that an IGMP/MLD proxy device receives multicast packets
      through multiple upstream interfaces.  The upstream interface is
      selected with manually configured supported address prefixes and
      interface priority value.  A take-over operation switching from an
      inactive upstream interface to an active upstream interface is also
      considered.

  "Multi-Path Time Synchronization", Alex Shpiner, Richard Tse, Craig
  Schelp, Tal Mizrahi, 2013-02-17,
  <draft-shpiner-multi-path-synchronization-01.txt>

      Clock synchronization protocols are very widely used in IP-based
      networks. The Network Time Protocol (NTP) has been commonly deployed
      for many years, and the last few years have seen an increasingly
      rapid deployment of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP). As time-
      sensitive applications evolve, clock accuracy requirements are
      becoming increasingly stringent, requiring the time synchronization
      protocols to provide high accuracy. Slave Diversity is a recently
      introduced approach, where the master and slave clocks (also known as
      server and client) are connected through multiple network paths, and
      the slave combines the information received through all paths to
      obtain a higher clock accuracy compared to the conventional one-path
      approach.  This document describes a multi-path approach to PTP and
      NTP over IP networks, allowing the protocols to run concurrently over
      multiple communication paths between the master and slave clocks. The
      multi-path approach can significantly contribute to clock accuracy,
      security and fault protection. The Multi-Path Precision Time Protocol
      (MPPTP) and Multi-Path Network Time Protocol (MPNTP) define an
      additional layer that extends the existing PTP and NTP without the
      need to modify these protocols. MPPTP and MPNTP also allow backward
      compatibility with nodes that do not support the multi-path
      extension.

  "VP8 as RTCWEB Mandatory to Implement", Harald Alvestrand, Adrian
  Grange, 2013-02-25, <draft-alvestrand-rtcweb-vp8-01.txt>

      This document recommends that the RTCWEB working group choose the VP8
      specification as a mandatory to implement video codec for RTCWEB
      implementations.
      
      This document is not intended for publication as an RFC.

  "An XCON Client Conference Control Package for the Media Control Channel
  Framework", Chris Boulton, Mary Barnes, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-boulton-dispatch-conference-control-package-01.txt>

      The Centralized Conferencing (XCON) framework defines a model whereby
      client initiated interactions are required for creation, deletion,
      manipulation and querying the state of a of conference.  This
      document defines a Media Control Channel Package for XCON
      conferencing client initiated Conference Control.  The Package is
      based on the Media Control Channel Framework, which is also used for
      media server control, thus optimizing the implementation for some
      entities participating in an XCON system.

  "Operational management of Loop Free Alternates", Stephane Litkowski,
  Bruno Decraene, Clarence Filsfils, Kamran Raza, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-litkowski-rtgwg-lfa-manageability-01.txt>

      Loop Free Alternates (LFA), as defined in RFC 5286 is an IP Fast
      ReRoute (IP FRR) mechanism enabling traffic protection for IP traffic
      (and MPLS LDP traffic by extension).  Following first deployment
      experiences, this document provides operational feedback on LFA,
      highlights some limitations, and proposes a set of refinements to
      address those limitations.  It also proposes required management
      specifications.
      
      This proposal is also applicable to remote LFA solution.

  "LISP Impact", Damien Saucez, Luigi Iannone, Florin Coras, 2013-02-20,
  <draft-saucez-lisp-impact-01.txt>

      The Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) aims at improving
      the Internet scalability properties leveraging on three simple
      principles: address role separation, encapsulation, and mapping.  In
      this document, based on implementation, deployment, and theoretical
      studies, we discuss the impact that deployment of LISP has on both
      the Internet in general and for the end-users in particular.

  "Cryptographic Security Characteristics of 802.11 Wireless LAN Access
  Systems", Stephen Orr, Anthony Grieco, Dan Harkins, 2012-10-15,
  <draft-orr-wlan-security-architectures-00.txt>

      This note identifies all of the places that cryptography is used in
      Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) architectures, to simplify the
      task of selecting the protocols, algorithms, and key sizes needed to
      achieve a consistent security level across the entire architecture.

  "VRRP PIM Interoperability", Wei Zhou, 2013-02-21,
  <draft-zhou-pim-vrrp-01.txt>

      This document introduces VRRP Aware PIM, a redundancy mechanism for
      the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) to interoperate with Virtual
      Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).  It allows PIM to track VRRP state
      and to preserve multicast traffic upon failover in a redundant
      network with virtual routing groups enabled.

  "Message Disposition Notification", Tony Hansen, Alexey Melnikov,
  2013-07-15, <draft-hansen-mdn-3798bis-01.txt>

      This memo defines a MIME content-type that may be used by a mail user
      agent (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of a
      message after it has been successfully delivered to a recipient.
      This content-type is intended to be machine-processable.  Additional
      message header fields are also defined to permit Message Disposition
      Notifications (MDNs) to be requested by the sender of a message.  The
      purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality often
      found in other messaging systems, such as X.400 and the proprietary
      "LAN-based" systems, and often referred to as "read receipts,"
      "acknowledgements", or "receipt notifications."  The intention is to
      do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often been
      expressed when such functions have been discussed in the past.
      
      Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other
      messaging systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary "LAN-based"
      systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-
      protocol messaging environment.  To this end, the protocol described
      in this memo provides for the carriage of "foreign" addresses, in
      addition to those normally used in Internet Mail.  Additional
      attributes may also be defined to support "tunneling" of foreign
      notifications through Internet Mail.

  "SDP for the WebRTC", Suhas Nandakumar, Cullen Jennings, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-nandakumar-rtcweb-sdp-02.txt,.pdf>

      The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) [WEBRTC] working group is
      charged to provide protocol support for direct interactive rich
      communication using audio,video and data between two peers' web
      browsers.  With in the WebRTC framework, Session Description protocol
      (SDP) [RFC4566] is used for negotiating session capabilities between
      the peers.  Such a negotiataion happens based on the SDP Offer/Answer
      exchange mechanism described in the RFC 3264 [RFC3264].
      
      This document serves a introductory purpose in describing the role of
      SDP for the most common WebRTC use-cases.
      
      This SDP examples provided in this document is still a work in
      progress, but aims to align closest to the evolving standards.

  "Flow Specification Extensions to OSPF Protocol", Rashmi Shrivastava,
  Mike Dubrovsky, Keyur Patel, Burjiz Pithawala, 2013-04-17,
  <draft-shrivastava-ospf-flow-spec-01.txt>

      This document describes the extensions to the OSPF protocol to
      distribute the traffic flow specification rules and associated
      actions.  The notion and principles of operation of the mechanism
      were initially introduced into the BGP protocol.  The IPv4 part of
      specification was published in RFC5575 and later the specification
      was enhanced for IPv6 via draft-raszuk-idr-flow-spec-v6.  The
      mechanism allows the routing protocol to distribute information about
      the traffic flows and associated actions such as packet filtering
      with it.

  "Tree Notification to Improve Multicast Fast Reroute", IJsbrand
  Wijnands, Luc De Ghein, Gabor Envedi, Andras Csaszar, Jeff Tantsura,
  2013-07-09, <draft-wijnands-rtgwg-mcast-frr-tn-01.txt>

      This draft proposes dataplane triggered Tree Notifications to support
      multicast fast reroute for PIM and mLDP.  These Tree Notifications
      are initiated by a node detecting the failure to a Repair Node
      downstream.  A Repair Node is a node that has a pre-built backup path
      that can circumvent the failure.  Using this mechanism, a Repair Node
      has the ability to learn about non-local failures quickly without
      having to wait for the IGP to convergence.  This draft also covers an
      optional method to avoid bandwidth usage on the pre-built backup
      path.

  "E-VPN Operations, Administration and Maintenance Requirements and
  Framework", Samer Salam, Ali Sajassi, Sam Aldrin, John Drake,
  2013-07-03, <draft-salam-l2vpn-evpn-oam-req-frmwk-01.txt>

      This document specifies the requirements and reference framework for
      Ethernet VPN (E-VPN) Operations, Administration and Maintenance
      (OAM). The requirements cover the OAM aspects of E-VPN, PBB-EVPN and
      TRILL-EVPN. The framework defines the layered OAM model encompassing
      the E-VPN service layer, network layer and underlying Packet Switched
      Network (PSN) transport layer.

  "Transaction SIGnature (TSIG) using CGA Algorithm in IPv6",  Hosnieh, 
  martin@v.loewis.de, Christoph Meinel, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-rafiee-intarea-cga-tsig-03.txt>

      The first step in the Transaction SIGnature (TSIG) (RFC 2845) process
      is the generation of a shared secret to be used between a DNS server
      and a host. The second step consists of modifying the DNS
      configuration so that the DNS server will know what key to use with
      which host, because this shared secret is only valid between a pair
      of hosts. This document, CGA-TSIG, proposes a possible way to
      eliminate the human intervention needed for the generation and
      exchange of keys between a DNS server and a host when SEcure Neighbor
      Discovery (SEND) (RFC 3971) is used. CGA-TSIG will facilitate the
      authentication process of a host with a DNS server and will reduce
      the time needed to accomplish DNS Updates. It will also provide a
      means for securing the authentication process between resolvers and
      clients. CGA-TSIG will be added, as an extension, to TSIG in order to
      provide data integrity and proof of IP address ownership. The current
      signature generation and verification process used in TSIG will be
      substituted with the use of the same parameters as are used in
      generating a secure address in IPv6 networks, i.e., Cryptographically
      Generated Addresses (CGA) (RFC 3972).

  "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Authorization Using DTCP Certificate",
  Darshak Thakore, 2013-07-13, <draft-dthakore-tls-authz-04.txt>

      This document specifies the use of Digital Transmission Content
      Protection (DTCP) certificates as an authorization data type in the
      authorization extension for the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
      Protocol.  This is in accordance with the guidelines for
      authorization extensions as specified in [RFC5878].  As with other
      TLS extensions, this authorization data can be included in the client
      and server Hello messages to confirm that both parties support the
      desired authorization data types.  If supported by both the client
      and the server, DTCP certificates are exchanged in the supplemental
      data TLS handshake message as specified in RFC4680.  This
      authorization data type extension is in support of devices containing
      DTCP certificates, issued by the Digital Transmission Licensing
      Administrator [DTLA].

  "Distributed Mobility Management - Framework & Analysis", Marco Liebsch,
  Pierrick Seite, Georgios Karagiannis, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-liebsch-dmm-framework-analysis-01.txt>

      Mobile operators consider the distribution of mobility anchors to
      enable offloading some traffic from their core network.  The
      Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) Working Group is investigating
      the impact of decentralized mobility management to existing protocol
      solutions, while taking into account well defined requirements, which
      are to be met by a future solution.  This document discusses DMM
      using a functional framework.  Functional Entities to support DMM as
      well as reference points between these Functional Entities are
      introduced and described.  The described functional framework allows
      distribution and co-location of Functional Entities and build a DMM
      architecture that matches the architecture of available protocols.
      Such methodology eases the analysis of best current practices with
      regard to functional and protocol gaps.

  "Vulnerability Data Model",  harold.booth@nist.gov, Karen Scarfone,
  2013-04-25, <draft-booth-sacm-vuln-model-02.txt>

      This Internet-Draft describes the Vulnerability Data Model (VDM)
      version 1.0, a vendor neutral data model for expressing data and
      metadata for individual vulnerabilities, and an XML format that can
      be used to exchange vulnerability data model information.  VDM
      provides standard fields, formats and vocabularies that can be used
      to transmit information about software vulnerabilities between
      entities in an interoperable manner.  VDM is suited for a wide
      variety of use cases, and provides extension points to facilitate
      additional use cases.

  "NADA: A Unified Congestion Control Scheme for Real-Time Media",
  Xiaoqing Zhu, Rong Pan, 2013-03-12, <draft-zhu-rmcat-nada-01.txt>

      This document describes a scheme named network-assisted dynamic
      adaptation (NADA), a novel congestion control approach for
      interactive real-time media applications, such as video conferencing.
      In the proposed scheme, the sender regulates its sending rate based
      on either implicit or explicit congestion signaling, in a unified
      approach. The scheme can benefit from explicit congestion
      notification (ECN) markings from network nodes. It also maintains
      consistent sender behavior in the absence of such markings, by
      reacting to queuing delays and packet losses instead.
      
      We present here the overall system architecture, recommended
      behaviors at the sender and the receiver, as well as expected network
      node operations. Results from extensive simulation studies of the
      proposed scheme are available upon request.

  "TRILL: Nickname and Label Properties", Donald Eastlake, Hao Weiguo,
  2013-04-17, <draft-eastlake-trill-nick-label-prop-01.txt>

      There are a number of current and prospective requirements to
      indicate properties of nicknames, labels, and blocks thereof, for use
      with the TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links, RFC
      6325) protocol. To meet that need, this document specifies IS-IS
      (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) sub-TLVs and some of
      their uses.

  "H.264 as Mandatory to Implement Video Codec for WebRTC", BoB, Markus
  Isomaki, Bernard Aboba, Gaelle Martin-Cocher, Giridhar Mandyam, Xavier
  Marjou, 2013-02-25, <draft-burman-rtcweb-h264-proposal-01.txt>

  "Session Peering Provisioning (SPP) Protocol over REST", Mickael
  Marrache, David Schwartz, Syed Ali, 2013-04-22,
  <draft-marrache-drinks-spp-protocol-rest-02.txt,.pdf>

      The Session Peering Provisioning Framework (SPPF) is a framework that
      exists to enable the provisioning of session establishment data into
      Session Data Registries or SIP Service Provider data stores.  This
      SPP Protocol implementation follows the REST architectural principles
      over HTTP to allow efficient provisioning of session establishment
      data.  The benefits include inter alia better performances under high
      loads through the use of HTTP caches and proxies and less coupling
      between clients and servers.  This document describes the
      specification of a protocol for transporting SPPF structures over
      HTTP(s) following REST architectural principles.

  "RSVP-TE LSP egress fast-protection", Jeyananth Jeganathan, Hannes
  Gredler, Yimin Shen, 2013-04-25,
  <draft-minto-rsvp-lsp-egress-fast-protection-02.txt>

      RFC4090 defines a fast reroute mechanism for locally repairing an
      RSVP-TE LSP in the order of 10s of milliseconds, in the event of a
      downstream link or node failure.  However, this mechanism does not
      provide node protection for LSP egress nodes, even when an alternate
      egress node (a backup egress) is available that could carry the
      traffic to its ultimate destination.  This document addresses this
      scenario and describes how to provide egress protection by
      establishing a bypass LSP from the penultimate-hop node of a LSP to
      the backup egress node.  The methods described in this document
      enable local repair in the order of 10s of milliseconds, in the event
      of the egress node failure.  These methods are only applicable if
      traffic carried by the LSP can be rerouted to its ultimate
      destination by the backup egress node.

  "RSVP-TE Extensions For Signaling GMPLS Restoration LSP", Rakesh Gandhi,
  Zafar Ali, Gabriele Galimberti, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-gandhi-ccamp-gmpls-restoration-lsp-01.txt>

      In transport networks, there are requirements where Generalized
      Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) recovery scheme need to employ
      restoration LSP while keeping resources for the working and/ or
      protecting LSPs reserved in the network. Existing GMPLS recovery
      procedures do not address these requirements. This document describes
      best common practice for using RSVP-TE for GMPLS recovery with
      restoration LSP.

  "Resource Reservation Protocol Multiple Instance Object", James Polk,
  Subha Dhesikan, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-polk-rsvp-multi-instance-object-01.txt>

      This document creates the framework for a new Resource Reservation
      Protocol version 1 (RSVP) object for instances in which there are
      multiple occurrences of existing RSVP objects is to be included
      within the same RSVP message. This document offers two instances for
      multiple versions of the same object will be valid in RSVP messages,
      for more than one traffic specification object (TSPEC), and more
      than one TSPEC priority object (PREEMPTION_PRI).

  "Power-Aware Networks (PANET): Problem Statement", Beichuan Zhang,
  Junxiao Shi, Jie Dong, Mingui Zhang, Mohamed Boucadair, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-zhang-panet-problem-statement-02.txt>

      Energy consumption of network infrastructures is growing fast due to
      exponential growth of data traffic and the deployment of increasingly
      powerful equipment.  There are emerging needs for power-aware routing
      and traffic engineering, which adapt routing paths to traffic load in
      order to reduce energy consumption network-wide.  This document
      outlines the design space and problem areas for potential IETF work.

  "Model Based Internet Performance Metrics", Matt Mathis, Al Morton,
  2013-02-25, <draft-mathis-ippm-model-based-metrics-01.txt>

      We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to determine
      if a long path can meet predefined end-to-end application performance
      targets.  This is done by section-by-section testing -- by applying a
      suite of single property tests to successive sections of a long path.
      In many cases these single property tests are based on existing IPPM
      metrics, with the addition of success and validity criteria.  The
      sub-path at a time tests are designed to facilitate IP providers
      eliminating all known conditions that might prevent the full end-to-
      end path from meeting the users target performance.
      
      This approach makes it possible to to determine the IP performance
      requirements needed to support the desired end-to-end TCP
      performance.  The IP metrics are based on traffic patterns that mimic
      TCP but are precomputed independently of the actual behavior of TCP
      over the sub-path under test.  This makes the measurements open loop,
      eliminating nearly all of the difficulties encountered by traditional
      bulk transport metrics, which rely on congestion control equilibrium
      behavior.
      
      A natural consequence of this methodology is verifiable network
      measurement: measurements from any given vantage point are repeatable
      from other vantage points.

  "Why Operators Filter Fragments and What It Implies", Joel Jaeggli,
  Lorenzo Colitti, Warren Kumari, Eric Vyncke, Merike Kaeo, Tom Taylor,
  2013-06-04, <draft-taylor-v6ops-fragdrop-01.txt>

      This memo was written to make application developers and network
      operators aware of the significant possibility that IPv6 packets
      containing fragmentation extension headers may fail to reach their
      destination.  Some protocol or application assumptions about the
      ability to use messages larger than a single packet may accordingly
      not be supportable in all networks or circumstances.
      
      This memo provides observational evidence for the dropping of IPv6
      fragments along a significant number of paths, explores the
      operational impact of fragmentation and the reasons and scenarios
      where drops occur, and considers the effect of fragment drops on
      applications where fragmentation is known to occur, particularly
      including DNS.

  "Using Extended Key Usage (EKU) for REsource LOcation And Discovery
  (RELOAD) X.509 Certificates", Marc Petit-Huguenin, 2013-04-29,
  <draft-petithuguenin-p2psip-reload-eku-01.txt>

      This document describes an Extended Key Usage (EKU) X.509 certificate
      extension for restricting the usage of a certificate to a REsource
      LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) overlay.

  "Layer-3 virtual network overlays based on BGP Layer-3 VPNs", Dhananjaya
  Rao, John Mullooly, Rex Fernando, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-drao-bgp-l3vpn-virtual-network-overlays-02.txt>

      Virtual network overlays are being designed and deployed in various
      types of networks, including data centers.  These network overlays
      address several requirements including flexible network
      virtualization and multi-tenancy, increased scale, and support for
      mobility of virtual machines.  Such overlay networks can be used to
      provide both Layer-2 and Layer-3 network services to hosts at the
      network edge.  New packet encapsulations are being defined and
      standardized to support these virtual networks.  These
      encapsulations, such as VXLAN and NVGRE, are primarily based on IP
      and are currently defined to support a Layer-2 forwarding service.
      
      BGP based Layer-3 VPNs, as specified in RFC 4364, provide an industry
      proven and well-defined solution for supporting Layer-3 virtual
      network services.  However, RFC 4364 procedures use MPLS labels to
      provide the network virtualization capability in the data plane.
      With the increasing support for IP overlay encapsulations in data
      center devices, there is a strong preference to utilize this support
      to deploy Layer-3 virtual networks using the familiarpolicy and
      operational primitives of Layer-3 VPNs.
      
      This document describes the use of BGP Layer-3 VPNs alongwith the new
      IP-based virtual network overlay encapsulations to provide a Layer-3
      virtualization solution for all IP traffic, and specifies mechanisms
      to use the new encapsulations while continuing to leverage the BGP
      Layer-3 VPN control plane techniques and extensions.  This mechanism
      provides an efficient incremental solution to support forwarding for
      IP traffic, irrespective of whether it is destined within or across
      an IP subnet boundary.

  Requirements", Lawrence Kreeger, Thomas Narten, David Black, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-kreeger-nvo3-hypervisor-nve-cp-01.txt>

      The document "Problem Statement: Overlays for Network Virtualization"
      discusses the needs for network virtualization using overlay networks
      in highly virtualized data centers.  The problem statement outlines a
      need for control protocols to facilitate running these overlay
      networks.  This document outlines the high level requirements related
      to the interaction between hypervisors and the Network Virtualization
      Edge device when the two entities are not co-located on the same
      physical device.

  "A One-Way Delay Metric for IPPM", Guy Almes, Sunil Kalidindi, Matthew
  Zekauskas, Al Morton, 2013-04-22, <draft-morton-ippm-2679-bis-02.txt>

      This memo (RFC 2679 bis) defines a metric for one-way delay of
      packets across Internet paths.  It builds on notions introduced and
      discussed in the IPPM Framework document, RFC 2330; the reader is
      assumed to be familiar with that document.

      This document discusses the security properties of the OpenFlow
      Switch Specification version 1.3.0 (OpenFlow), a Software-Defined
      Network (SDN) solution produced by the Open Networking Foundation
      (ONF).  It analyzes the suitability of OpenFlow for use in "the
      cloud" or on the open Internet.  It also makes some suggestions about
      how OpenFlow could be made more secure for use in those environments.

  "Stateful PCE extensions for MPLS-TE LSPs", Edward Crabbe, Jan Medved,
  Ina Minei, Robert Varga, 2013-05-10,
  <draft-crabbe-pce-stateful-pce-mpls-te-01.txt>

      The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
      mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
      computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
      
      [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to
      provide stateful control.  This document describes the objects and
      TLVs to be used with these PCEP extensions to control Multiprotocol
      Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
      LSP) via a stateful PCE.

  "A workaround for termination of IPv4 network services", Hiroaki
  Hazeyama, Atsushi Onoe, Osamu Nakamura, 2013-03-11,
  <draft-hiromi-sunset4-termination-ipv4-01.txt>

      After sun-setting of IPv4, many devices will be connected to IPv6
      single stack network. In this document we describe a workaround for
      IPv6 enabled network configuration. At this moment, the condition of
      IPv6 adoption on the consumer devices such as PC, tablet, mobile
      terminal and entertainment device are various. For example, some
      devices are fully support IPv6 client but some are not. It is very
      hard to provide IPv6 network service with these various conditioned
      devices. To solve this problem, we tried to verify some
      configurations to connect these devices into IPv6 enabled consumer
      network for termination of IPv4 network services.

  "I-PAKE: Identity-Based Password Authenticated Key Exchange", Taekyoung
  Kwon, Hyojin Yoon, Sang Kim, 2013-05-03,
  <draft-kwon-yoon-kim-ipake-01.txt>

      Although password authentication is the most widespread user
      authentication method today, cryptographic protocols for mutual
      authentication and key agreement, i.e., password authenticated key
      exchange (PAKE), in particular authenticated key exchange (AKE) based
      on a password only, are not actively used in the real world. This
      document introduces a quite novel form of PAKE protocols that employ
      a particular concept of ID-based encryption (IBE). The resulting
      cryptographic protocol is the ID-based password authenticated key
      exchange (I-PAKE) protocol which is a secure and efficient PAKE
      protocol in both soft- and hard-augmented models. I-PAKE achieves the
      security goals of AKE, PAKE, and hard-augmented PAKE. I-PAKE also
      achieves the great efficiency by allowing the whole pre-computation
      of the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman public keys by both server and
      client.

  "Reducing Power Consumption using BGP path selection", Shankar Raman,
  Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Vasan Srini, 2013-03-26,
  <draft-mjsraman-panet-bgp-power-path-02.txt>

      In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
      consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between
      Autonomous Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS
      and then use suitable modifications to the BGP path selection
      algorithm to route the packets along the paths. Such low-power paths
      can be identified by using the consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth
      (PWR) ratio as an additional parameter in the BGP Path Selection
      Algorithm. For re-routing the data traffic through these low-power
      paths, the power based best path is selected and advertised as per
      the modified algorithm proposed in this document. Extensions to the
      Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) can be used to disseminate the PWR
      ratio metric among the AS thereby creating a collaborative approach
      to reduce the power consumption. The feasibility of our approaches is
      illustrated by applying our algorithm to a subset of the Internet.
      The techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-AS power
      reduction require minimal modifications to the existing features of
      the Internet. The proposed techniques can be extended to other levels
      of Internet hierarchy, such as Intra-AS paths, through suitable
      modifications. A recent addition is the use of this method in AIGP
      domains and also the use of power source data in the calculation of
      low power paths using the BGP path selection algorithm.

  "Reducing Power Consumption using BGP", Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat,
  Gaurav Raina, 2013-03-26, <draft-mjsraman-panet-inter-as-psp-02.txt>

      In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
      consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between
      Autonomous Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS
      and then use Traffic Engineering (TE) techniques to route the packets
      along the paths. Such low-power paths can be identified by using the
      consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth (PWR) ratio as an additional
      constraint in the Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm.
      For re-routing the data traffic through these low-power paths, the
      Inter-AS Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans
      multiple AS can be used. Extensions to the Border Gateway Protocol
      (BGP) can be used to disseminate the PWR ratio metric among the AS
      thereby creating a collaborative approach to reduce the power
      consumption. Since calculating the low-power paths can be
      computationally intensive, a graph-labeling heuristic is also
      proposed. This heuristic reduces the computational complexity but may
      provide a sub-optimal low-power path. The feasibility of our
      approaches is illustrated by applying our algorithm to a subset of
      the Internet. The techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-AS
      power reduction require minimal modifications to the existing
      features of the Internet. The proposed techniques can be extended to
      other levels of Internet hierarchy, such as Intra-AS paths, through
      suitable modifications.

  "Building power shortest inter-Area TE LSPs using pre-computed paths",
  Shankar Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, 2013-05-03,
  <draft-mjsraman-panet-intra-as-psp-te-leak-01.txt>

      In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
      consumption of an Autonomous System (AS) using a collaborative
      approach between areas within an AS. We identify the low-power paths
      within non-backbone areas and then use Traffic Engineering (TE)
      techniques to route the packets along the stitched paths from non-
      backbone areas / backbone area to other non-backbone areas. Such low-
      power paths can be identified by using the power-to-available-
      bandwidth (PWR) ratio as an additional constraint in the Constrained
      Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm. For routing the data traffic
      through these low-power paths, the Inter-Area Traffic Engineered
      Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans multiple areas can be used.
      Extensions to the Interior Gateway Protocols like OSPF and IS-IS that
      support TE extensions can be used to disseminate information about
      low-power paths in the respective areas (backbone or non-backbone)
      that minimize the PWR ratio metric on the links within the areas and
      between the areas thereby creating a collaborative approach to reduce
      the power consumption.
      
      The feasibility of our approaches is illustrated by applying our
      algorithm to an AS with a backbone area and several non-backbone
      areas. The techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-Area power
      reduced paths require a few modifications to the existing features of
      the IGPs supporting TE extensions. The proposed techniques can be
      extended to other levels of Internet hierarchy, such as Inter-AS
      paths, through suitable modifications as in [11].
      
      When link state routing protocols like OSPF or ISIS are used to
      discover TE topology, there is the limitation that traffic engineered
      paths can be set up only when the head and tail end of the label
      switched path are in the same area. There are solutions to overcome
      this limitation either using offline Path Computation Engine (PCE)
      that attach to multiple areas and know the topology of all areas.
      This document proposes an alternative approach that does not require
      any centralized PCE and uses selective leaking of low-power TE path
      information from one area into other areas.

  "Power Based Topologies and TE-Shortest Power Paths in OSPF", Shankar
  Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Vasan Srini, 2013-03-27,
  <draft-mjsraman-panet-ospf-power-topo-02.txt>

      In a Interior Gateway Protocol like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
      the computation of the Constrained shortest path to destinations is
      computed for an area say a backbone or a non-backbone area using the
      TE-metrics advertised in the area. With importance given to the
      reduction of power within a network it becomes important to provide a
      solution that reduces the power consumed amongst routers and links
      that make up the network (in this case an area or a collection of
      areas including the backbone and non-backbone areas). This proposal
      aims at providing such a solution by producing a power topology of
      the area / areas. This power topology is constructed by assigning
      metrics to links based on the power consumed by the linecards (and
      hence their respective ports in an indirect way) of adjacent routers
      that are interconnected by each such link.

  "The SignPuddle Standard for SignWriting Text", Stephen Slevinski,
  2013-05-09, <draft-slevinski-signwriting-text-01.txt>

      For concreteness, because the universal character set is not yet
      universal, and because an international standard for the internet
      community should be documented and stable, this I-D has been released
      with the intention of producing an RFC to document the character use
      and naming conventions of the SignWriting community on the Internet.
      
      The SignWriting Script is an international standard for writing sign
      languages by hand or with computers.  From education to research,
      from entertainment to religion, SignWriting has proven useful because
      people are using it to write signed languages.  The SignWriting
      Script has two major families: Block Printing for the reader and
      Handwriting for the writer.  The script encoding model presented in
      this document evolved from the Block Printing half of the SignWriting
      Script.
      
      The SignWriting Text encoding model encompasses the Block Printing
      family of the SignWriting Script.  The plain text model for the
      mathematical names has been stable since January 12th, 2012.  The
      visual image can be SVG generated on the server or created with an
      experimental TrueType Font.  The coded character sets and character
      encoding forms are documented with regular expressions.
      
      The ad hoc graphemes of informal SignWriting were first created in
      1974.  Ad hoc graphemes are still used in the handwriting family.
      The standardized symbols of computerized Block Printing text began in
      1986.  After several generations of writers and standardized
      symbolsets, the ISWA 2010 has been optimized and refined as a 16-bit
      coded character set with several isomorphic encodings based on an
      ordered hierarchy with 6 degrees of significance.  The International
      SignWriting Alphabet 2010 is a mathematical symbolset that has been
      stable since its initial release on May 11th, 2010.
      
      The SignPuddle Standard for SignWriting Text is an open and freely
      available encoding model for sign language as text.  The licenses
      include the Open Font License for the fonts, Creative Commons by-sa
      (Attribution, Share Alike) for the documentation, and the GPL for the
      software implementation.  The technological infrastructure continues
      to expand and should be fully realized by the time this I-D has
      become an RFC.  SignPuddle Online contains almost 1 million examples
      of 2-dimensional signs written by the internet community.  Each
      logogram has a mathematical name which describes the freeform
      placement of the symbols.  These strings are the written record of
      the sign.  This standard and emerging infrastructure are used for the
      sign language Wikipedia project on Wikimedia Labs.  This standard is
      being integrated with the SignTyp linguistic coding system developed
      by Rachel Channon through an NSF grant.  This standard was the origin
      for the alternate Unicode proposals.
      
      For Unicode, the current use of the Private Use Area font characters
      is documented.  The state of the TrueType Font is explained.  A
      character proposal for plane 1 is included that is isomorphic with
      the characters that are currently used by the community.
      
      Three appendices discuss additional topics to the standard.  The
      first discusses the Modern SignWriting theory and example document,
      stable since January 12, 2012.  The second discusses the founding
      principles of Cartesian SignWriting: a script encoding model for
      SignWriting Block Printing.  The third discusses a common framework
      for written sign language grammar.
      
      This memo concretely defines a conceptual character encoding map for
      the Internet community.  It is published for reference, examination,
      implementation, and evaluation.  Distribution of this memo is
      unlimited.

  Balaji Venkat, Kamakoti Veezhinathan, Gaurav Raina, 2013-05-04,
  <draft-mjsraman-panet-tcam-power-efficiency-02.txt>

      This specification entails enabling power and performance management
      in Routers (multi-chassis and single chassis) with respect to TCAM
      and SRAM usage on intelligent router line cards  that implement
      Virtual Aggregation of routes.
      
      The version 00 of this document had several errata that have been
      addressed in this version. This scheme relates to unicast alone since
      multicast entries are programmed only after consultation with the
      unicast entries in the software plane in the Route processor. Hence
      this scheme does not apply to multicast.

      This document aims at establishing a common understanding about the
      evaluation of different information-centric networking (ICN)
      approaches so that they can be tested and compared against each other
      while showcasing their own advantages.  Towards this end, we review
      the ICN literature and document scenarios which have been considered
      in previous performance evaluation studies.  We discuss a variety of
      aspects that an ICN solution can address.  This includes general
      aspects, such as, network efficiency, reduced complexity, increased
      scalability and reliability, mobility support, multicast and caching
      performance, real-time communication efficacy, energy consumption
      frugality, and disruption and delay tolerance.  We detail ICN-
      specific aspects as well, such as information security and trust,
      persistence, availability, provenance, and location independence.  We
      then survey the evaluation tools currently available to researchers
      in this area and provide suggestions regarding methodology and
      metrics.  Finally, this document sheds some light on the impact of
      ICN on network security.

  "Attacks on Cryptographic Hashes in Internet Protocols", Paul Hoffman,
  Bruce Schneier, 2013-04-29, <draft-hoffman-schneier-4270bis-02.txt>

      Announcements in the past decade of better-than-expected collision
      attacks in popular hash algorithms have caused some people to
      question whether common Internet protocols need to be changed, and if
      so, how.  This document summarizes the use of hashes in many
      protocols, discusses how the collision attacks affect and do not
      affect the protocols, shows how to thwart known attacks on digital
      certificates, and discusses future directions for protocol designers.
      It also gives rationales for moving away from some hash algorithms
      altogether and for choosing when to start using newer, presumably
      better, hash algorithms in Internet protocols.
      
      This document obsoletes RFC 4270 and introduces significant new
      material that has been learned since the publication of that
      document.

  "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Channel IDs", Dirk Balfanz, Ryan
  Hamilton, 2013-06-29, <draft-balfanz-tls-channelid-01.txt>

      This document describes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension
      for identifying client machines at the TLS layer without using bearer
      tokens.

  "RPKI validation using a local cache", Tim Bruijnzeels, Carlos Martinez,
  Andrew Newton, 2013-02-24,
  <draft-tbruijnzeels-sidr-validation-local-cache-01.txt>

      This documents specifies validation of rpki using a local cache that
      is independent of any particular retrieval mechanism of the objects
      in this cache.  This is useful because it allows for agility in the
      RPKI to define alternative fetch algorithms and/or multiple
      publication points of RPKI data.

  "Interactions between LFA and RSVP-TE", Stephane Litkowski, Bruno
  Decraene, Clarence Filsfils, Kamran Raza, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-litkowski-rtgwg-lfa-rsvpte-cooperation-01.txt>

      This document defines the behavior of a node supporting Loopfree
      Alternates (LFA) when the node has established RSVP TE tunnels.  It
      first describes the decisions to be made by the LFA mechanism with
      respect to the use of TE tunnels as LFA candidates.  Second, it
      discusses the use of RSVP TE tunnels as a way to complement the LFA
      coverage, illustrating how these technologies can benefit from each
      other.

  "Internet International Bank Account Number (IIBAN)", Walter Stanish,
  2013-05-16, <draft-stanish-iiban-01.txt>

      An Internet IBAN (IIBAN) identifies an internet-based financial
      endpoint in a manner that is superset-compatible with the existing
      European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS) International Bank
      Account Number (IBAN) standard [ISO13616] and implementation
      recommendations [ECBS].  This document obsoletes draft-iiban-00.

  "Enhancing Location Based IP Services", Ammar Salih, 2013-05-17,
  <draft-add-location-to-ipv6-header-01.txt>

      This document describes IP-LOC, a proposed extension to IPv6 header
      which suggests adding optional geo-location field, in order to
      enhance existing geo-location based IP service as well as adding new
      ones.
      
      The current method of determining geo-location of IP traffic is
      through RIR (Regional Internet Registry) database, this information
      is not very accurate as it depends on how the ISP registers its IP
      subnets, that is normally done in a country/city format.
      
      It also assumes that in the future, GPS capability could be added to
      the router itself (just like smart phones) and packet marking and
      classification based on geo-location will be required.
      
      QoS, firewall and routing based on geo-location might also be
      required in the future when mobile routers move from one geo-location
      to another, which has a different policy.

  "NVGRE and VXLAN Encapsulation for L3VPN Extension", Lucy Yong, KuiKe
  Building, 2013-05-21, <draft-yong-l3vpn-nvgre-vxlan-encap-01.txt>

      This document specifies NVGRE and VXLAN encapsulation for L3VPN
      Extension. Both NVGRE and VXLAN are originally designed for L2
      overlay. The draft proposes the enhancement on both to allow L3
      overlay completely decoupled from the L2 overlay in terms of
      encoding schema and data processing.

  "RPKI Repository Delta Protocol", Tim Bruijnzeels, Oleg Muravskiy, Bryan
  Weber, 2013-02-11, <draft-tbruijnzeels-sidr-delta-protocol-01.txt>

      In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), certificate
      authorities publish certificates, including end entity certificates,
      and CRLs to repositories on publication servers.  Relying Parties
      (RP) retrieve the published information from the repository and MAY
      store it in a cache.  This document specifies a delta protocol which
      provides relying parties with a mechanism to query a repository for
      changes, thus enabling the RP to keep its state in sync with the
      repository.

  "OAuth Token Introspection", Justin Richer, 2013-05-01,
  <draft-richer-oauth-introspection-04.txt>

      This specification defines a method for a client or protected
      resource to query an OAuth authorization server to determine meta-
      information about an OAuth token.

  "Redundant BFD sessions", Marc Binderberger, Nobo Akiya, 2013-05-07,
  <draft-mbind-bfd-redundancy-01.txt>

      This document defines a second or "shadow" BFD session to an existing
      "primary" BFD session, providing resiliency against BFD failures that
      are not legitimate.
      
      Scenarios will be discussed on how presence of a shadow BFD session
      will be beneficial in the context of high availability.

  "DSCP and other packet markings for RTCWeb QoS", Subha Dhesikan, Dan
  Druta, Paul Jones, James Polk, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-dhesikan-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos-02.txt>

      Many networks, such as service provider and enterprise networks, can
      provide per packet treatments based on Differentiated Services Code
      Points (DSCP) on a per hop basis.  This document provides the
      recommended DSCP values for browsers to use for various classes of
      traffic.

  "Using PCP to Reveal a Host behind NAT", Mohamed Boucadair, Tirumaleswar
  Reddy, Prashanth Patil, Dan Wing, 2013-05-28,
  <draft-boucadair-pcp-nat-reveal-01.txt>

      This document describes how to use PCP to retrieve the identity of a
      host behind a NAT.  Two use cases are discussed and the PCP
      applicability is analyzed.  This document extends PCP with a new
      OpCode called QUERY Opcode.
      
      The proposed mechanism is valid for all NAT flavors including NAT44,
      NAT64 or NPTv6.

  "Enhanced Closed Swarm protocol", Dusan Gabrijelcic, 2013-06-01,
  <draft-ppsp-gabrijelcic-ecs-01.txt>

      The Enhanced Closed Swarm (ECS) protocol is a distributed access
      control mechanism suitable for usage in Peer-to-Peer content delivery
      systems.  The protocol provides coarse or fine grained authorization
      of peers participating in content distribution.  As a result, only
      authorized peers are allowed to communicate in a swarm.  The protocol
      also provides data confidentiality, integrity and origin
      authentication for application data exchanged among peers.  The
      protocol is simple but flexible enough to enable a range of usage
      scenarios.  In addition to the ECS protocol, this document also
      describes its application in the IETF PPSPP.

  "A PCE-based Architecture for Application-based Network Operations",
  Daniel King, Adrian Farrel, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-farrkingel-pce-abno-architecture-05.txt>

      Services such as content distribution, distributed databases, or
      inter-data center connectivity place a set of new requirements on the
      operation of networks.  They need on-demand and application-specific
      reservation of network connectivity, reliability, and resources (such
      as bandwidth) in a variety of network applications (such as point-to-
      point connectivity, network virtualization, or mobile back-haul) and
      in a range of network technologies from packet (IP/MPLS) down to
      optical.  An environment that operates to meet this type of
      requirement is said to have Application-Based Network Operations
      (ABNO).
      
      ABNO brings together many existing technologies for gathering
      information about the resources available in a network, for
      consideration of topologies and how those topologies map to
      underlying network resources, for requesting path computation, and
      for provisioning or reserving network resources.  Thus, ABNO may be
      seen as the use of a toolbox of existing components enhanced with a
      few new elements.  The key component within an ABNO is the Path
      Computation Element (PCE), which can be used for computing paths and
      is further extended to provide policy enforcement capabilities for
      ABNO.
      
      This document describes an architecture and framework for ABNO
      showing how these components fit together.  It provides a cookbook of
      existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and meet the needs
      of the applications.

  "Creating an IETF Working Group Draft", Adrian Farrel, Dave Crocker,
  2013-05-28, <draft-crocker-id-adoption-02.txt>

      The productive output of IETF working groups is documents, as
      mandated by the working group's charter.  When a working group is
      ready to develop a particular document it usually "adopts" it as a
      working group draft.  The document that a working group adopts and
      then develops further is based on initial input at varying levels of
      maturity.  An initial working group draft might be a document already
      in wide use, or it might be a blank sheet, wholly created by the
      working group, or it might represent any level of maturity in
      between.  This document discusses the process of creating formal
      working group drafts that are targeted for publication.

  "Architecture for MANET Clustering", Sanghyun Ahn, Hyogon Kim,
  2013-05-13, <draft-ahn-manet-clustering-architecture-01.txt>

      This document describes the architecture for clustering in the MANET
      which can be an efficient communication structure for the case
      when MANET nodes have the tendency of forming groups. In this type of
      MANET, each group of nodes forms a cluster which is represented by a
      cluster head. In this draft, we define the terminology for the MANET
      clustering and the related communication procedure.

  "AODV Extensions for MANET Clustering", Sanghyun Ahn, Seoul University,
  2013-05-13, <draft-ahn-manet-clustering-aodv-01.txt>

      This document describes an extention on AODV [1] so that clustering
      of MANET nodes can be allowed for the improvement of MANET
      scalability. MANET clustering requires some MANET nodes to become
      Cluster Heads (CHs) and each non-CH MANET nodes to belong to any one
      appropriate cluster which is represented by a CH node.In this draft,
      AODV control messages are extended for MANET clustering.

  "Signature Authentication in IKEv2", Tero Kivinen, 2013-04-16,
  <draft-kivinen-ipsecme-signature-auth-01.txt>

      The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has limited
      support for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
      The current version only includes support for three Elliptic Curve
      groups, and there is fixed hash algorithm tied to each curve.  This
      document generalizes the IKEv2 signature support so it can support
      any signature method supported by the PKIX and also adds signature
      hash algorithm negotiation.  This is generic mechanism, and is not
      limited to ECDSA, but can also be used with other signature
      algorithms.

  "remoteStorage", Michiel de Jong, F. Kooman, 2013-06-08,
  <draft-dejong-remotestorage-01.txt>

      This draft describes a protocol by which client-side applications,
      running inside a web browser, can communicate with a data storage
      server that is hosted on a different domain name. This way, the
      provider of a web application need not also play the role of data
      storage provider. The protocol supports storing, retrieving, and
      removing individual documents, as well as listing the contents of an
      individual directory, and access control is based on bearer tokens.

  "A DNS Resource Record for Service Descriptions", Eliot Lear,
  2013-02-21, <draft-lear-httpbis-svcinfo-rr-01.txt>

      Certain application protocols are highly transactional and require
      substantial care when dealing with latency.  Queries for versioning
      information are, in these circumstances, costly.  In addition, there
      is a desire to allow for a means to specify a lightweight means to
      alternative transport protocols, such as making use of SCTP instead
      of TCP.  This memo specifies a new DNS RR with an eye toward the
      least necessary roundtrips to determine various protocols, port
      numbers, and options for a given service instance.

  "Requirements for Marking SIP Messages to be Logged", Peter Dawes,
  2013-06-13, <draft-dawes-dispatch-logme-reqs-02.txt>

      SIP networks use signalling monitoring tools to diagnose user
      reported problem and for regression testing if network or client
      software is upgraded.  As networks grow and become interconnected,
      including connection via transit networks, it becomes impractical to
      predict the path that SIP signalling will take between clients, and
      therefore impractical to monitor SIP signalling end-to-end.
      
      This draft describes requirements for adding an indicator to the SIP
      protocol which can be used to mark signalling as of interest to
      logging.  Such marking will typically be applied as part of network
      testing controlled by the network operator and not used in regular
      client signalling.  However, such marking can be carried end-to-end
      including the SIP terminals, even if a session originates and
      terminates in different networks.

  "Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology", Scott Bradner, Jorge
  Contreras, 2013-06-12, <draft-bradner-rfc3979bis-05.txt>

      The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), such as
      patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are
      designed to ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as
      much information about any IPR constraints on a technical proposal as
      possible.  The policies are intended to benefit the Internet
      community and the public at large, while respecting the legitimate
      rights of IPR holders.  This memo details the IETF policies
      concerning IPR related to technology worked on within the IETF.  It
      also describes the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.
      This memo updates RFC 2026 and obsoletes RFC 3979 and RFC 4879.

  "Via header field parameter to indicate received realm", Christer
  Holmberg, Yi Jiang, 2013-06-14,
  <draft-holmberg-sipcore-received-realm-01.txt>

      This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
      Via header field parameter, "received-realm", which allows a SIP
      entity acting as an entry point to a transit network to indicate from
      which adjacent upstream network a SIP request is received, using a
      network realm value associated with the adjacent network.

  "Compact representation of an elliptic curve point", Andrey Jivsov,
  2013-06-04, <draft-jivsov-ecc-compact-02.txt,.pdf>

      This document defines a format for efficient storage representation
      of an elliptic curve point over prime fields, suitable for use with
      any IETF format or protocol.

  "JSON Metadata for OAuth Responses 1.0", Mike Kelly, Nat Sakimura,
  2013-02-12, <draft-sakimura-oauth-meta-02.txt>

      This specification defines an extensible metadata member that may be
      inserted into the OAuth 2.0 responses to assist the clients to
      process those responses.  It is expressed as a member called "_links"
      that is inserted as the top level member in the responses.  It will
      allow the client to learn where the members in the response could be
      used and how, etc.  Since it is just a member, any client that does
      not understand this extension should not break and work normally
      while supporting clients can utilize the metadata to its advantage.

  "Delay Limits and Multiplexing Policies to be employed with Tunneling
  Compressed Multiplexed Traffic Flows", Mirko Suznjevic, Jose Saldana,
  2013-06-14, <draft-suznjevic-tsvwg-mtd-tcmtf-01.txt,.pdf>

      This document contains recommendations to be taken into account when
      using methods which optimize bandwidth utilization through
      compression, multiplexing, and tunneling traffic flows (TCMTF) over a
      network path.  Different multiplexing policies and implementation
      issues which are service and link specific are discussed.
      Additionally, this document describes policies which can be used for
      detecting, classifying, and choosing the network flows suitable for
      optimization by using TCMTF.  Finally, recommendations of maximum
      tolerable delays to be added by optimization techniques are reported.
      Recommendations are presented only for network services for which
      such bandwidth optimization techniques are applicable (i.e., services
      with low payload to header size ratio, which will also be denoted as
      "small-packet flows").

  "Requirements for Automated (Configuration) Management", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet, 2013-06-10,
  <draft-boucadair-network-automation-requirements-01.txt>

      Given the ever-increasing complexity of the configuration tasks
      required for the dynamic provisioning of IP networks and services,
      this document aims at listing the requirements to drive the
      specification of an automated configuration management framework,
      including the requirements for a protocol to convey configuration
      information towards the managed entities.

  "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Auxiliary Object Class
  'mailboxRelatedObject'", Michael Stroeder, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-stroeder-mailboxrelatedobject-02.txt>

      This document defines the auxiliary object class
      'mailboxRelatedObject' that can be used to associate an arbitrary
      object with a RFC 2822 mail address.  Furthermore a attribute
      'intlMailAdr' is defined for internationalized email addresses.

  "Analysis of RSVP-TE Security According to KARP Design Guide", Mahesh
  Jethanandani, Dacheng Zhang, 2013-05-20,
  <draft-mahesh-karp-rsvp-te-analysis-01.txt>

      This document analyzes Resource reSerVation Protocol-Traffic
      Engineering (RSVP-TE) according to guidelines set forth in section
      4.2 of KARP Design Guidelines (RFC 6518).

  "The WebSocket Protocol as a Transport for the Message Session Relay
  Protocol (MSRP)", Peter Dunkley, Gavin Llewellyn, Victor Pascual,
  2013-05-10, <draft-pd-dispatch-msrp-websocket-02.txt>

      The WebSocket protocol enables two-way real-time communication
      between clients and servers.  This document specifies a new WebSocket
      sub-protocol as a reliable transport mechanism between MSRP (Message
      Session Relay Protocol) clients and relays to enable usage of MSRP in
      new scenarios.  This document normatively updates RFC 4975 and RFC
      4976.

  "ALTO Server Discovery based on well-known IP Address", Sebastian
  Kiesel, Reinaldo Penno, 2013-06-27,
  <draft-kiesel-alto-ip-based-srv-disc-02.txt>

      The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
      provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several
      hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired
      resource.  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.
      
      This document establishes a well-known IP address for the ALTO
      service and specifies how ALTO clients embedded in the resource
      consumer can use it to access the ALTO service.
      
      Terminology and Requirements Language
      
      This document makes use of the ALTO terminology defined in RFC 5693
      [RFC5693].

  "A ROA Status Attribute for RPSL Objects", Larry Blunk, 2013-06-14,
  <draft-blunk-rpsl-roa-01.txt>

      This document describes an attribute for Routing Policy Specification
      Language (RPSL) route and route6 objects that documents the presence
      and validity of a Route Origin Authorization (ROA) for the given
      prefix and origin values contained within the object.  It allows
      parties who employ Internet Routing Registries (IRR's) for routing
      policy configuration generation to easily ascertain whether a given
      object has a ROA covering the object.  The primary objective is to
      enable existing IRR tools to make use of the ROA information with
      minimal modifications.

  "Backup Path for Point-to-Point Routes in Low Power and Lossy Networks",
  Dinh-Sy Do, Ngoc-Thanh Dinh, Young-Han Kim, 2013-06-18,
  <draft-do-roll-p2p-backup-01.txt>

      In this draft, a backup path setup mechanism is proposed for the
      P2P-RPL protocol in Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). This
      mechanism allows sensor nodes to send packets over the backup path
      without rediscovering the p2p path in case of path failure, thus
      improving the reliability of p2p transmission.

  "Large-Scale Broadband Measurement Use Cases", Marc Linsner, Philip
  Eardley, Trevor Burbridge, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-linsner-lmap-use-cases-03.txt>

      Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important for
      network diagnostics by providers and users, as well for as public
      policy.  To conduct such measurements, user networks gather data,
      either on their own initiative or instructed by a measurement
      controller, and then upload the measurement results to a designated
      measurement server.  Understanding the various scenarios and users of
      measuring broadband performance is essential to development of the
      system requirements.  The details of the measurement metrics
      themselves are beyond the scope of this document.

  "OAuth 2.0 Resource Set Registration", Thomas Hardjono, 2013-06-29,
  <draft-hardjono-oauth-resource-reg-01.txt>

      This specification defines a resource set registration mechanism
      between an OAuth 2.0 authorization server and resource server.  The
      resource server registers information about the semantics and
      discovery properties of its resources with the authorization server.

  "Encapsulating IP in UDP", KuiKe Building, Lucy Yong, Yiu Lee, Fan
  Yongbing, Rajiv Asati, Iljitsch van Beijnum, 2013-06-30,
  <draft-xu-softwire-ip-in-udp-02.txt>

      Existing Softwire encapsulation technologies are not adequate for
      efficient load balancing of Softwire service traffic across IP
      networks. This document specifies additional Softwire encapsulation
      technology, referred to as IP-in-User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which
      can facilitate the load balancing of Softwire service traffic across
      IP networks.

  "OCSP-lite - Revocation of raw public keys", Bert Greevenbosch,
  2013-06-06, <draft-greevenbosch-tls-ocsp-lite-01.txt>

      This document provides an online mechanism for checking the
      revocation status of raw public keys.  The mechanism is based on its
      older brother for X.509 certificates, OCSP.
      
      Note
      
      Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should
      be sent to tls@ietf.org.

  "End-point based Multimedia QoE Management", Bhumip Khasnabish, Gerard
  Fernando, Lin Ya, 2013-07-07,
  <draft-khasnabish-dispatch-qoe-management-02.txt>

      This draft describes a method for improving the quality of experience
      (QoE) for real-time video and other multimedia services using
      features and functions of the end-point only, that is, without
      requiring any upgrade to the network transport infrastructure.  Any
      upgrade to the network transport infrastructure not only incurs
      significant costs, these are also time consuming and technology-
      dependent.  Therefore, these QoE improvement mechanisms are
      significantly more attractive to both network operators and service
      providers.

  "A Simple Secure Addressing Scheme for IPv6 AutoConfiguration (SSAS)", 
  Hosnieh, Christoph Meinel, 2013-07-15, <draft-rafiee-6man-ssas-05.txt>

      The default method for IPv6 address generation uses an
      Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) assigned by the IEEE
      Standards Association and an Extension Identifier assigned to the
      hardware manufacturer [1] (section 2.5.1 RFC-4291) [RFC4291]. This
      fact thus means that a node will always have the same Interface ID
      (IID) whenever it connects to a new network. Because the node's IP
      address does not change, the node will be vulnerable to privacy
      related attacks. Currently this problem is addressed by the use of
      two mechanisms that do not make use of the MAC address, or other
      unique values that can be used for ID generation, for randomizing the
      IID; Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] and
      Privacy Extension [RFC4941]. The problem with the former approach is
      the computational cost involved for the IID generation and in the
      verification process. The problem with the latter approach is that it
      lacks necessary security mechanisms and provides the node with only
      partial protection against privacy related attacks. This document
      proposes the use of a new algorithm for use in the generation of the
      IID while, at the same time, securing the node against some types of
      attack, like IP spoofing. These attacks are prevented by the addition
      of a signature to messages sent over the network and by finding a
      binding with the nodes' IP address and its public key. The use of
      theResource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), introduced in this
      document, is based on the centralized version explained in RFC 6494
      and RFC 6495.

  "Self-published IP Geolocation Data", Erik Kline, Krzysztof Duleba,
  Zoltan Szamonek, 2013-07-28,
  <draft-google-self-published-geofeeds-02.txt>

      This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish
      a mapping of IP address ranges to simplified geolocation information,
      colloquially termed a geolocation "feed".  Interested parties can
      poll and parse these feeds to update or merge with other geolocation
      data sources and procedures.
      
      Some technical organizations operating networks that move from one
      conference location to the next have already experimentally published
      small geolocation feeds.  At least one consumer (Google) has
      incorporated these ad hoc feeds into a geolocation data pipeline.

  "Update Attribute Flag Low Bits Clarification", Susan Hares, John
  Scudder, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-hares-idr-update-attrib-low-bits-fix-01.txt,.pdf>

      This draft provides an update to RFC 4721 to clarify the use of the
      lower-order four bits of the Attribute flag in the Update message.

  "Computing Power Saving Paths using TCAM Power Ratio", Shankar Raman,
  Balaji Venkat, Kamakoti Veezhinathan, 2013-02-02,
  <draft-mjsraman-panet-tcam-power-ratio-02.txt>

      A power saving scheme for switching of TCAM banks of fine granularity
      is discussed in [ID-TCAM-POWER-EFF]. This scheme switches of TCAM
      banks of fine granularity and their corresponding SRAM banks
      depending on the occupancy of routes and their rewrites within the
      TCAM of a intelligent router line card (where one or more such TCAM
      entities along with their SRAM banks may reside) by using an
      algorithm specified in [ID-TCAM-POWER-EFF]. This takes care of
      switching off TCAM and SRAM banks within a router's line card and
      correspondingly saves power when the traffic matrix is not large with
      respect to the routes the packets lookup where the occupancy of such
      routes is low in the line card. This is with reference to both single
      and multi-chassis devices. The algorithm specified therein tends to
      switch off banks which are not in use. The aim of this draft is to
      use the device level characteristic in the form of a TCAM Power Ratio
      and disseminate it as a metric within an area or an Autonomous system
      (where multiple such areas exist within an AS) to compute power
      saving paths through the set of routers where the TCAM-POWER-RATIO is
      low. The TCAM-POWER-RATIO is arrived at by dividing the number of
      bits in the TCAM banks that are switched off by the Total Available
      TCAM bank space in bits. This ratio is then subjected to the CSPF
      algorithm as an additional constraint or the only constraint as the
      case may be in a link state protocol like OSPF or IS-IS with Traffic
      Engineering Extensions with available utilization on the links also
      being a factor. This way those routers that have more TCAM banks
      switched off are avoided and those with higher power consumption but
      with available bandwidth are used hence not increasing the total
      power consumed within the area and hence within the AS. This could be
      achieved by using a PCE like entity that calculates the power
      shortest paths using this TCAM-POWER-RATIO.

  "List of Internet Official Protocol Standards: Replaced by an Online
  Database", Sandy Ginoza, 2013-02-13,
  <draft-rfced-rfcxx00-retired-01.txt>

      This document obsoletes RFC 5000 ("Internet Official Protocol
      Standards"), which contained a snapshot of the Standards Track
      documents as of May 2008, and moves RFC 5000 to Historic.  This
      document also retires the subseries identifier STD 1, which has
      previously been associated with publications of the "Internet

  "Traffic Management Benchmarking", Barry Constantine, Timothy Copley,
  Ram Krishnan, 2013-04-19,
  <draft-constantine-bmwg-traffic-management-01.txt>

      This framework describes a practical methodology for benchmarking the
      traffic management capabilities of networking devices (i.e. policing,
      shaping, etc.). The goal is to provide a repeatable test method that
      objectively compare performance of the device's traffic management
      capabilities and to specify the means to benchmark traffic management
      with representative application traffic.

  "TRILL: Parent Selection in Distribution Trees", Howard Yang, Ayan
  Banerjee, Donald Eastlake, Radia Perlman, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-yang-trill-parent-seletion-01.txt>

      This document describes a protocol extension in TRILL IS-IS and a
      parent selection tiebreak algorithm in the calculation of
      distribution trees in TRILL. The proposal is to modify the current
      algorithm to improve the stability of the distribution trees when
      multiple equal cost parents are present. It also offers the
      capabilities of pinning down multi-destination traffic and re-shaping
      the distribution trees to improve the traffic load balancing.

  "IMAP $Important Keyword and \Important Special-Use Attribute", Barry
  Leiba, Eric Iceman, 2013-04-15,
  <draft-iceman-imap-specialuse-important-02.txt>

      RFC 6154 created an IMAP Special-Use LIST extension and defined an
      initial set of attributes.  This document defines a new attribute,
      "\Important", and establishes a new IANA registry for IMAP folder
      attributes, registering the attributes defined in RFCs 3348, 3501,
      and 6154.  This document also defines a new IMAP keyword,
      "$Important", and registers it in the registry defined in RFC 5788.

  "Chatrooms within a Centralized Conferencing (XCON) System", Mary
  Barnes, Chris Boulton, Salvatore Loreto, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-boulton-dispatch-session-chat-01.txt>

      The document "A Framework for Centralized Conferencing" defines a
      centralized conference as both signaling and protocol agnostic.  The
      primary examples within this framework focus on audio and video as
      the media types for the session.  This document provides an overview
      of the mechanisms defined in the centralized conferencing framework
      that can be used to support multi-user chat.  In addition, the
      document describes additional functionality and requirements
      necessary to provide feature rich functionality.

  "The problem statement of RBridge edge group state synchronization", Hao
  Weiguo, Li Yizhou, ZTE Corporation, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-hao-trill-rb-syn-01.txt>

      In TRILL multi-homing scenario, the concept of virtual RBridge in
      [TRILLPN], was introduced to address the MAC flip-flopping problem at
      remote RBridges. Based on virtual RBridge mechanism, Coordinated
      Multicast Trees (CMT) solution in [CMT] was introduced to solve the
      related RPF issues. In this document, additional problems are
      described regarding virtual Bridges members' state synchronization in
      multi-homing scenario, including virtual RBridge membership auto
      discovery, pseudo-nickname static configuration consistency check,
      dynamic pseudo-nickname allocation, CMT configuration
      synchronization ,LACP configuration and state synchronization,
      node/link failure detection, and MAC table synchronization. To
      address these problems, a communication protocol among members of a
      virtual RBridge group should be provided. Requirements for this
      protocol is also discussed.

  "Autonomous Extensible Internet with Network Address Multiplexing(AEIP
  NAM)", Yuping Diao, Diao Yongping, Ming Liao, 2013-07-28,
  <draft-diao-aeip-nam-01.txt>

      The two key issues of today's Internet are autonomy and
      extensibility. Autonomous Internet(AIP) technology can provide
      extensible internet architecture, own independent root DNS servers
      and self management internet network; Furthermore, based on the
      Autonomous Internet, here provides a way with extensible address
      capacity to solve IP address deficiency and realize
      Autonomous Extensible Internet(AEIP) with global network address
      and multiplexing local network address. This AEIP with Network
      Address Multiplexing(AEIP NAM) can realize autonomy and extensibility
      with minimal cost.

  "Flow-state dependent packet selection techniques", ramki, So Ning,
  2013-06-18, <draft-krishnan-ipfix-flow-aware-packet-sampling-05.txt>

      The demands on the networking infrastructure and thus the
      switch/router bandwidths are growing exponentially; the drivers are
      bandwidth hungry rich media applications, inter data center
      communications etc. Using sampling techniques, for a given sampling
      rate, the amount of samples that need to be processed is increasing
      exponentially especially for applications like security threat
      detection. This draft elaborates on flow-state dependent packet
      selection techniques and the relevant information models. It
      describes how these techniques can be effectively used to reduce the
      number of samples for applications like security threat detection.

  "Coupled congestion control for RTP media", Michael Welzl, Safiqul
  Islam, Stein Gjessing, 2013-06-14, <draft-welzl-rmcat-coupled-cc-01.txt>

      When multiple congestion controlled RTP sessions traverse the same
      network bottleneck, it can be beneficial to combine their controls
      such that the total on-the-wire behavior is improved.  This document
      describes such a method for flows that have the same sender, in a way
      that is as flexible and simple as possible while minimizing the
      amount of changes needed to existing RTP applications.

  "Key Relay Mapping for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol", R. Gieben,
  M. Groeneweg, Rik Ribbers, Antoin Verschuren, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-gieben-epp-keyrelay-03.txt>

      This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
      extension mapping for the purpose of relaying DNSSEC key material
      from one DNS operator to another, by using the administrative
      registration channel through the registrant, registrar and registry.
      The mapping introduces "<keyrelay>" as a new command in EPP.
      
      This command will help facilitate changing the DNS operator of a
      domain while keeping the DNSSEC chain of trust intact.

  "Writing I-Ds and RFCs using Pandoc and a bit of XML", R. Gieben,
  2013-07-05, <draft-gieben-pandoc2rfc-02.txt>

      This document presents a technique for using a Markdown syntax
      variant, called Pandoc, and a (bit) of XML [RFC2629] as a source
      format for documents in the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and Request for
      Comments (RFC) series.
      
      The goal of this technique is to let an author of an I-D focus on the
      main body of text without being distracted too much by XML tags, it
      does however not alleviate the need to typeset some files in XML.

  "ZSS Short Signature Scheme for BN Curves", Laura Hitt, 2013-02-11,
  <draft-hitt-zssbn-01.txt>

      This document describes the ZSS Short Signature Scheme for
      implementation from bilinear pairings on Barreto-Naerhig (BN)
      ordinary elliptic curves. The ZSS Short Signature Scheme uses general
      cryptographic hash functions such as SHA-1 or SHA-2 and is efficient
      in terms of pairing operations.

  "Balanced Security for IPv6 CPE", Martin Gysi, Guillaume Leclanche, Eric
  Vyncke, Ragnar Anfinsen, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-v6ops-vyncke-balanced-ipv6-security-01.txt>

      This document describes how an IPv6 residential Customer Premise
      Equipment (CPE) can have a balanced security policy that allows for a
      mostly end-to-end connectivity while keeping the major threats
      outside of the home.  It is based on an actual IPv6 deployment by
      Swisscom and proposes to allow all packets inbound/outbound EXCEPT
      for some layer-4 ports where attacks and vulnerabilities (such as
      weak passwords) are well-known.

  "Registration Data Access Protocol Basic Search Processing", Scott
  Hollenbeck, Andrew Newton, 2013-06-18,
  <draft-hollenbeck-weirds-rdap-search-02.txt>

      This document describes path segments and query parameters needed to
      construct HTTP URLs that may be used to search for and retrieve
      registration information from registries (including both Regional
      Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs)) using
      "RESTful" web access patterns.  It also describes a method of
      encoding responses using Javascript Object Notation (JSON).

  "The Use of MPLS Special Purpose Labels for the Computation of Load
  Balancing", Carlos Pignataro, Loa Andersson, Kireeti Kompella,
  2013-02-16, <draft-pignataro-mpls-reserved-labels-lb-01.txt>

      In addition to being used for forwarding, an MPLS label stack may
      also be used as an entropy source to perform load balancing
      computation in various ways.  RFC 4928 and RFC 6790 describe this
      mechanism in great detail.  However, those two RFCs differ in the use
      of MPLS special purpose labels (previously referred to as "reserved
      labels") for computation of load balancing.  This document addresses
      this difference in specifications by providing a more comprehensive
      set of recommendations.
      
      This document updates RFC 4928 and RFC 6790.

  "Asymmetric OSPF Hold Timer", Madhukar Anand, Hasmit Grover, Abhay Roy,
  2013-06-16, <draft-madhukar-ospf-agr-asymmetric-01.txt>

      Current OSPF standard requires that the HELLO/Dead interval be
      symmetric on either side of the link in order to maintain adjacency.
      There are many scenarios in which this may not be desirable. This
      memo describes a technique to allow OSPF adjacency to be maintained
      with asymmetric values of the OSPF Dead interval.

  "Hybrid Unicast/Multicast DNS-Based Service Discovery", Stuart Cheshire,
  2013-07-11, <draft-cheshire-mdnsext-hybrid-02.txt>

      Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely Multicast DNS
      allows discovery only of services present on the local link.  Using a
      very large local link with thousands of hosts improves service
      discovery, but at the cost of large amounts of multicast traffic.
      
      Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely Unicast DNS is
      more efficient, but requires configuration of DNS Update keys on the
      devices offering the services, which can be onerous for simple
      devices like printers and network cameras.
      
      Hence a compromise is needed, that provides easy service discovery
      without requiring either large amounts of multicast traffic or
      onerous configuration.

  "Binding Obligations on User-Managed Access (UMA) Participants", Eve
  Maler, Thomas Hardjono, 2013-07-30, <draft-maler-oauth-umatrust-01.txt>

      User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0.  UMA defines how
      resource owners can control protected-resource access by clients
      operated by arbitrary requesting parties, where the resources reside
      on any number of resource servers, and where a centralized
      authorization server governs access based on resource owner policy.
      This document provides a contractual framework that defines the
      minimum obligations of parties that operate and use UMA-conforming
      software programs and services.  The goal of this framework is to
      support end-to-end legal enforceability of the terms and conditions
      of access sharing relationships between authorizing and requesting
      sides that use UMA.  The audience for this document includes
      technologists, legal professionals, and operators of UMA-conforming
      services.

  "Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive
  Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol", Emil Ivov, Eric Rescorla,
  Justin Uberti, 2013-03-11, <draft-ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice-01.txt>

      This document describes an extension to the Interactive Connectivity
      Establishment (ICE) protocol that allows ICE agents to send and
      receive candidates incrementally rather than exchanging complete
      lists.  With such incremental provisioning, ICE agents can begin
      connectivity checks while they are still gathering candidates and
      considerably shorten the time necessary for ICE processing to
      complete.
      
      The above mechanism is also referred to as "trickle ICE".

  "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Hashed Attribute values
  for 'userPassword'", Michael Stroeder, 2013-03-13,
  <draft-stroeder-hashed-userpassword-values-01.txt>

      This document describes the widely used syntax for storing hashed
      passwords in LDAP attribute 'userPassword'.  Furthermore it points
      out some of the deficiencies of the approach.  Its purpose is solely
      to document current practice, it does not define a new standard.

  "IGP Extensions for Stateful PCE Discovery", Siva Sivabalan, Jan Medved,
  Xian Zhang, 2013-07-12, <draft-sivabalan-pce-disco-stateful-02.txt>

      When a PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR) participating in the
      Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a server participating in
      IGP, its presence and path computation capabilities can be advertised
      using IGP flooding.  Such IGP extensions exist for OSPF and ISIS.
      This document specifies two new PCE capabilities advertised by IGP.

  "On Consensus and Humming in the IETF", Pete Resnick, 2013-03-18,
  <draft-resnick-on-consensus-02.txt>

      The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work through
      a consensus process, taking into account the different views among
      IETF participants and coming to (at least rough) consensus on
      technical matters.  In particular, the IETF is supposed not to be run
      by a "majority rules" philosophy.  This is why we engage in rituals
      like "humming" instead of voting.  However, more and more of our
      actions are now indistinguishable from voting, and quite often we are
      letting the majority win the day, without consideration of minority
      concerns.  This document is a collection of thoughts on what rough
      consensus is, how we have gotten away from it, and the things we can
      do in order to really achieve rough consensus.
      
      Note: This document contains the musings of an individual.  Right
      now, it is just some rough notes and has lots of holes that need
      to be filled in.  Even if those holes are filled, in its current
      form, it is not intended to be published as an RFC, let alone
      being a BCP for a change of IETF policy.  If it evolves into such
      a thing, great.  If it simply sparks discussion as an Internet
      Draft, that's a perfectly fine outcome.

  "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) usage for Trickle ICE", Emil Ivov,
  Enrico Marocco, Christer Holmberg, 2013-01-30,
  <draft-ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice-sip-00.txt>

      The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol describes a
      Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal for UDP-based multimedia
      sessions established with the offer/answer model.  The ICE extension
      for Incremental Provisioning of Candidates (Trickle ICE) defines a
      mechanism that allows ICE agents to shorten session establishment
      delays by making the candidate gathering and connectivity checking
      phases of ICE non-blocking.
      
      This document defines usage semantics for Trickle ICE with SIP.

  "The "action" Link Relation", Ioseb Dzmanashvili, 2013-01-31,
  <draft-ioseb-dzmanashvili-action-link-relation-00.txt>

      RFC 5988 [RFC5988] defined the way of indicating resources on the
      Web. This specification defines link relation type that may be used
      to express the relationships between a resource and associated
      actions that may be performed against context resource.

  "Forward Error Correction for WebRTC using FEC FRAME", Giridhar Mandyam,
  Mike Luby, Thomas Stockhammer, Christian Foisy, 2013-01-31,
  <draft-mandyam-rtcweb-fecframe-00.txt,.pdf>

      WebRTC provides a solution for peer-to-peer streaming between web
      applications by leveraging a Real-Time Protocol (RTP) stream between
      two clients.  This RTP stream is expected to be sent over an UDP
      (Universal Datagram Protocol) connection, which by definition has no
      built-in reliability.  Recently the FEC FRAME Working Group of the
      IETF has come up with a framework and technical recommendations for
      applying forward error correction (FEC) to unreliable streams.  This
      framework can be applied to WebRTC with minimal changes to the
      specification.

  "Data Types in the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service Protocol
  (RADIUS)", Alan DeKok, 2013-02-12, <draft-dekok-radext-datatypes-02.txt>

      RADIUS specifications have used data types for two decades, without
      rigorously defining them as managed entities.  During this time,
      RADIUS implementations have named the data types, and have used them
      to as managed entities in attribute definitions.  This document
      updates the specifications to match established prctice.  We do this
      by naming data types defined in [RFC6158], which have been used since
      at least [RFC2865].  We provide an IANA registry for the data types,
      and update the RADIUS Attribute Type registry to include a "data
      type" field for each attribute.  Finally, we recommend that authors
      of RADIUS specifications use these types in preference to existing
      practice.

  "Report from the IAB/IRTF Workshop on Congestion Control for Interactive
  Real-Time Communication", Hannes Tschofenig, Lars Eggert, Zaheduzzaman
  Sarker, 2013-04-02, <draft-iab-cc-workshop-report-01.txt>

      This document provides a summary of the IAB/IRTF Workshop on
      'Congestion Control for Interactive Real-Time Communication', which
      took place in Vancouver, Canada, on July 28, 2012.  The main goal of
      the workshop was to foster a discussion on congestion control
      mechanisms for interactive real-time communication.  This report
      summarizes the discussions and lists recommendations to the Internet
      Engineering Task Force (IETF) community.
      
      The views and positions in this report are those of the workshop
      participants and do not necessarily reflect the views and positions
      of the authors, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) or the Internet
      Research Task Force (IRTF).

  "CLUE Signaling", Paul Kyzivat, Lennard Xiao, Christian Groves, Robert
  Hansen, 2013-07-15, <draft-kyzivat-clue-signaling-04.txt>

      This document specifies how signaling is conducted in the course of
      CLUE sessions.  This includes how SIP/SDP signaling is applied to
      CLUE sessions as well as defining a CLUE-specific signaling protocol
      that complements SIP/SDP and supports negotiation of CLUE application
      level data.

  "Thoughts on syntax for representing multiple media streams", Adam
  Roach, 2013-01-31, <draft-roach-mmusic-mlines-00.txt>

      This document briefly explores the ramifications of combining
      multiple media streams into one SDP m= section versus expressing each
      in its own m= section.

  "A Reference Path and Measurement Points for LMAP", Marcelo Bagnulo,

      commonly used performance metrics.

  "JSON Hyper-Schema: Hypertext definitions for JSON Schema", Geraint
  Luff, Kris Zyp, Gary Court, 2013-01-31,
  <draft-luff-json-hyper-schema-00.txt>

      JSON Schema is a JSON based format for defining the structure of JSON
      data.  This document specifies hyperlink- and hypermedia-related
      keywords of JSON Schema.

  "JSON Schema: interactive and non interactive validation", Kris Zyp,
  Gary Court, 2013-01-31, <draft-fge-json-schema-validation-00.txt>

      JSON Schema (application/schema+json) has several purposes, one of
      which is instance validation.  The validation process may be
      interactive or non interactive.  For instance, applications may use
      JSON Schema to build a user interface enabling interactive content
      generation in addition to user input checking, or validate data
      retrieved from various sources.  This specification describes schema
      keywords dedicated to validation purposes.

  "Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for
  remote-initiated GMPLS LSP Setup", Zafar Ali, Siva Sivabalan, Clarence
  Filsfils, Robert Varga, Victor Lopez, Oscar de Dios, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ali-pce-remote-initiated-gmpls-lsp-01.txt,.pdf>

      PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP Setup in a Stateful PCE Model
      draft [I-D. draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] specifies
      procedures that can be used for creation and deletion of PCE-
      initiated LSPs under the active stateful PCE model. However, this
      specification is focused on MPLS networks, and does not cover
      remote instantiation of GMPLS paths.  This document complements
      PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP Setup in a Stateful PCE Model
      draft by addressing the extensions required for GMPLS applications,
      for example for OTN and WSON networks.
      
      When active stateful PCE is used for managing PCE-initiated LSP,
      PCC may not be aware of the intended usage of the LSP (e.g., in a
      multi-layer network). PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP Setup
      in a Stateful PCE Model draft does not address this requirement.
      This draft also addresses the requirement to specify on how PCC
      should use the PCEP initiated LSPs.

  "Multi-Media Concepts and Relations", BoB, Magnus Westerlund,
  2013-02-01, <draft-burman-rtcweb-mmusic-media-structure-00.txt>

      There are currently significant efforts ongoing in IETF regarding
      more advanced multi-media functionalities, such as the work related
      to RTCWEB and CLUE.  This work includes use cases for both multi-
      party communication and multiple media streams from an individual
      end-point.  The usage of scalable encoding or simulcast encoding as
      well as different types of transport mechanisms have created
      additional needs to correctly identify different types of resources
      and describe their relations to achieve intended functionalities.
      
      The different usages have both commonalities and differences in needs
      and behavior.  This document attempts to review some usages and
      identify commonalities and needs.  It then continues to highlight
      important aspects that need to be considered in the definition of
      these usages.

  "IPv6 IPID Needed", Nalini Elkins, Lawrence Kratzke, Michael Ackermann,
  Keven Haining, 2013-04-14, <draft-elkins-v6ops-ipv6-ipid-needed-01.txt>

      The IPv4 main header contained a 16-bit IP Identification (IPID) field
      used for fragmentation and reassembly.  In practice, this field
      was commonly used by network diagnosticians for tracking packets. In
      IPv6, the IPID has been moved to the Fragment header, and would only
      be used when fragmentation is required.  Thus, the IPID field in IPv6,
      is no longer able to be utilized in the valuable role it played in
      IPv4, relative to diagnostics and problem resolution.  This causes
      great concern in particular for end users and large enterprises, for
      whom Network/Application availability and performance can directly and
      profoundly affect bottom line financials. Several viable solutions to
      this situation exist.

  "IPv6 IPID Needed", Nalini Elkins, Lawrence Kratzke, Michael Ackermann,

      sections of this RFC, but the primary intention of this RFC is to
      initiate action by the IETF on this issue, perhaps in the form of a
      Working Group Subcommittee.

  "Using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Web Encryption (JWE) for
  Protecting JSON Web Key (JWK) Objects", Matthew Miller, 2013-06-13,
  <draft-miller-jose-jwe-protected-jwk-02.txt>

      This document specifies an approach to protecting a private key
      formatted as a JavaScript Syntax Object Notation (JSON) Web Key (JWK)
      object using JSON Web Encryption (JWE).  This document also specifies
      a set of algorithms for protecting such content using password-based

  "An argument for encoding multiple media sources per m= section of
  SDP.", Peter Thatcher, Justin Uberti, 2013-02-03,
  <draft-pthatcher-mmusic-many-sources-00.txt>

      This document explains why it is preferable to have multiple media
      sources encoded in SDP as one m= section rather than many m=
      sections, especially when there are a large number of video sources
      which change frequently and need dynamic resolution changes, such as
      in a video conferencing system.

  "Describing multiple RTP media streams in SDP", Roni Even, Jonathan
  Lennox, Qin Wu, 2013-02-17, <draft-even-mmusic-multiple-streams-02.txt>

      This document describes issues when describing multiple RTP streams
      in a single RTP session using SDP and considers the different RTP
      topologies that should be supported.  The document looks at current
      solutions and provides paths toward addressing the issues.

  "Operational Issues Associated With Long IPv6 Extension Header Chains",
  Warren Kumari, Joel Jaeggli, Ron Bonica, 2013-07-03,
  <draft-wkumari-long-headers-01.txt>

      This document explains why IPv6 header chain length affects the cost
      of ASIC-based packet forwarding.  It also explains why some network
      service providers discard packets with exceptionally long header
      chains.  Finally, it identifies a reasonable header chain length.
      While a network service provider can enforce any filtering policy
      that supports its security model, a network service provider should
      not discard IPv6 packets based solely upon header chain length if the
      header chain is not longer than the value specified herein.

      be sent to coman@ietf.org.

  "Hierarchical Join/Prune Attributes", Stig Venaas, Isidor Kouvelas,
  Jesus Arango, 2013-02-06, <draft-venaas-pim-hierarchicaljoinattr-00.txt>

      This document defines a hierachical method of encoding Join
      attributes, providing a more efficient encoding when the same
      attribute values need to be specified for multiple sources in a PIM
      Join/Prune message.

  "IPv4-IPv6 Multicast Address Dynamic Conversion", Yalin Cao, Cui Wang,
  Wei Meng, Bhumip Khasnabish, 2013-06-30,
  <draft-cao-sunset4-v4v6-mcast-addr-conversion-02.txt>

      This draft describes a mechanism for stateless conversion of IPv4
      multicast address to IPv6 multicast address and vice versa,using
      different rules.  These rules can be used in both IPv4-IPv6
      translation or encapsulation.  This solution can be used in any
      scenarios describe in [RFC6144].

  "Interconnecting IPv6 Multicast Islands over IPv4 Using IPv6 Multicast
  Provider Edge Routers", Cui Wang, Wei Meng, Bhumip Khasnabish, Jie Hu,
  2013-02-06, <draft-wang-mboned-glo-ipv6-mcast-reachability-00.txt>

      This draft presents a method to interconnect IPv6 multicast islands
      over an IPv4 cloud.  This method relies on IPv6 Multicast Provider
      Edge routers (6MPE), which support Dual-Stack in order to connect to
      IPv6 multicast islands and to the IPv4 core.  The 6MPE routers extend
      the Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol(MP-BGP), exchange the IPv6
      multicast reachability information transparently over the IPv4 core
      using the MP-BGP.

  "Length Hiding Padding for the Transport Layer Security Protocol",
  Alfredo Pironti, Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-pironti-tls-length-hiding-01.txt>

      This memo proposes length hiding methods of operation for the TLS
      protocol.  It defines a TLS extension to allow arbitrary amount of
      padding in any TLS ciphersuite, and it presents guidelines and a
      reference implementation of record fragmentation and padding so that
      the length of the exchanged messages is effectively concealed within
      a given range of lengths.  The latter guidelines also apply to the
      standard TLS padding allowed by the TLS block ciphers.

  "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) usage for Trickle ICE", Emil Ivov,
  Enrico Marocco, Christer Holmberg, 2013-02-07,
  <draft-ivov-dispatch-trickle-ice-sip-00.txt>

      The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol describes a
      Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal for UDP-based multimedia
      sessions established with the offer/answer model.  The ICE extension
      for Incremental Provisioning of Candidates (Trickle ICE) defines a
      mechanism that allows ICE agents to shorten session establishment
      delays by making the candidate gathering and connectivity checking
      phases of ICE non-blocking.
      
      This document defines usage semantics for Trickle ICE with SIP.

  "Early IANA Allocation of Standards Track Code Points", Michelle Cotton,
  2013-02-07, <draft-cotton-rfc4020bis-00.txt>

      This memo describes the process for early allocation of code points
      by IANA from registries for which "Specification Required", "RFC
      Required", "IETF Review", or "Standards Action" policies apply.  This
      process can be used to alleviate the problem where code point
      allocation is needed to facilitate desired or required implementation
      and deployment experience prior to publication of an RFC that would
      normally trigger code point allocation.
      
      This document obsoletes RFC 4020.

  "PCP Anycast Address", Stuart Cheshire, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-cheshire-pcp-anycast-02.txt>

      The Port Control Protocol Anycast Address enables PCP clients to
      transmit messages to their closest on-path NAT, Firewall, or other
      middlebox, without having to learn the IP address of that middlebox
      via some external channel.

  "Using IEEE802.15.4e TSCH in an LLN context: Overview, Problem Statement
  and Goals", Thomas Watteyne, Maria Palattella, Luigi Grieco, 2013-05-23,

      results from a Measurement Agent to a Collector, in the context of a
      large measurement platform.

  "Transmission of IPv6 packets over ITU-T G.9959 Networks", Anders
  Brandt, Jakob Buron, 2013-06-18, <draft-brandt-6man-lowpanz-02.txt,.pdf>

      This document describes the frame format for transmission of IPv6
      packets and a method of forming IPv6 link-local addresses and
      statelessly autoconfigured IPv6 addresses on ITU-T G.9959 networks.

  "Encrypt-then-MAC for TLS and DTLS", Peter Gutmann, 2013-06-28,
  <draft-gutmann-tls-encrypt-then-mac-03.txt>

      This document describes a means of negotiating the use of the
      encrypt-then-MAC security mechanism in place of TLS'/DTLS' existing
      MAC-then-encrypt one, which has been the subject of a number of
      security vulnerabilities over a period of many years.

  "Updates to PSC", Eric Osborne, 2013-02-08,
  <draft-osborne-psc-updates-00.txt>

      This document contains four updates to RFC6378, "MPLS Transport
      Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection".  Two of them correct existing
      behavior.  The third clears up a behavior which was not explained in
      the RFC, and the fourth adds rules around handling capabilities
      mismatches.

  "Plan to Establish a Wisdom Task Force", Norbert Bollow, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-bollow-wisdomtaskforce-07.txt>

      This memo calls for the creation of a new governance forum named
      "Wisdom Task Force" (WisdomTF).  The main purpose of the WisdomTF is
      to facilitate consensus-seeking strategy-oriented discussions
      regarding governance actions that may be decided by national
      parliaments.

  "TWAMP Flow-based Performance Measurement", Lishun Sun, Fang Yu,
  Xiangyang Gong, 2013-02-08, <draft-sun-ippm-twamp-flowbased-00.txt>

      This memo describes an extension to the Two-Way Active Measurement
      Protocol (TWAMP).  Through carrying the information of business flow,
      it can measure the online performance without bringing effect to
      application significantly.

  "Normalization Marker for AF PHB Group in DiffServ", Cheng-Jia Lai,
  Wenyi Wang, Stan Yang, Toerless Eckert, Fred Yip, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-lai-tsvwg-normalizer-02.txt>

      In DiffServ, preferential dropping of packets in AF PHB groups has
      long been considered beneficial, typically for video flows with
      discardable packets.  Unfortunately, the ecosystem of bandwidth
      contention at congestion is very likely to discourage those video
      endpoints from generating packets with lower precedence markings,
      i.e. they would lose more packets if doing so.  Thus, to offer an
      incentive for more collaborative and mutually beneficial behaviors of
      video endpoints in AF PHB groups, we propose a Normalization Marker
      (NM) for traffic conditioning at network edges.  Deployment of NM
      will encourage the video endpoints to generate finer layers of intra-
      flow precedence (IFP) with discardable packets in more balanced
      distributions.

  "A Generic Bundle Mechanism for the Session Description Protocol (SDP)",
  Dale Worley, 2013-03-15, <draft-worley-sdp-bundle-06.txt>

      This document defines a generic bundle mechanism for the Session
      Description Protocol (SDP) by which the media described by a number
      of media descriptions ("m= lines") are multiplexed and transmitted
      over a single transport association.  The single transport
      association is described by an additional media description, allowing
      SDP attributes to be applied to the aggregate, independently of
      attributes applied to the constituents.  In offer/answer usage, the
      bundle mechanism is backward compatible with SDP processors that do
      not understand the mechanism.  The mechanism is designed to be
      compatible with the limitations of the existing Internet
      infrastructure.

  "IS-IS Flooding Scope LSPs", Les Ginsberg, Stefano Previdi, Yi Yang,
  2013-06-16, <draft-ginsberg-isis-fs-lsp-01.txt>

      Intermediate System To Intermediate System (IS-IS) provides efficient
      and reliable flooding of information to its peers.  However the
      current flooding scopes are limited to either area wide scope or
      domain wide scope.  There are existing use cases where support of
      other flooding scopes are desirable.  This document defines new
      Protocol Data Units (PDUs) which provide support for new flooding
      scopes as well as additional space for advertising information
      targeted for the currently supported flooding scopes.
      
      The protocol extensions defined in this document are not backwards
      compatible with existing implementations and so must be deployed with
      care.

  "Recursive PCP", Stuart Cheshire, 2013-03-10,
  <draft-cheshire-recursive-pcp-02.txt>

      The Port Control Protocol (PCP) allows clients to request explicit
      dynamic inbound and outbound port mappings in their closest on-path
      NAT, firewall, or other middlebox.  However, in today's world, there
      may be more than one NAT on the path between a client and the public
      Internet.  This document describes how the closest on-path middlebox
      generates a corresponding upstream PCP request to the next closest
      on-path middlebox, to request an appropriate explicit dynamic port
      mapping in that middlebox too.  Applied recursively, this generates
      the necessary chain of port mappings in any number of middleboxes on
      the path between the client and the public Internet.

  "RADIUS Extended Request", Peter Deacon, 2013-05-01,
  <draft-deacon-radext-extended-request-01.txt>

      This document describes methods for RADIUS servers to communicate
      optional extended abilities to RADIUS clients. The abilities
      described provide for exchange of RADIUS packets where total packet
      length exceeds 4096 bytes.

  "ICN Research Challenges", Dirk Kutscher, Suyong Eum, Kostas
  Pentikousis, Ioannis Psaras, Daniel Corujo, Damien Saucez, Thomas
  Schmidt, Matthias Waehlisch, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-kutscher-icnrg-challenges-01.txt>

      This memo describes research challenges for Information-Centric
      Networking.  Information-centric networking is an approach to evolve
      the Internet infrastructure to directly support this use by
      introducing uniquely named data as a core Internet principle.  Data
      becomes independent from location, application, storage, and means of
      transportation, enabling in-network caching and replication.
      Challenges include naming, security, routing, system scalability,
      mobility management, wireless networking, transport services, in-
      network caching, and network management.

  "Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) Architecture",
  David Waltermire, 2013-02-10,
  <draft-waltermire-sacm-architecture-00.txt>

      This document identifies the architectural components, data flows,
      and the supporting standards needed to define an interoperable
      automation infrastructure required to support timely, accurate and
      actionable situational awareness over an organization's IT systems.
      This architecture is based on previous use case and requirements
      analysis.  Automation tools implementing the continuous monitoring
      approach described in this document will utilize this infrastructure
      together with existing and emerging event, incident and network
      management standards to provide visibility into the state of assets,
      user activities and network behavior.  Stakeholders will be able to
      use these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant security and
      operational data to understand the organizations security posture,
      quantify business risk, and make informed decisions that support
      organizational objectives while protecting critical information.
      Organizations will be able to use these tools to augment and automate
      information sharing activities to collaborate with partners to
      identify and mitigate threats.  Other automation tools will be able
      to integrate with these capabilities to enforce policies based on
      human decisions to harden systems, prevent misuse and reduce the
      overall attack surface.

  "Resource Priority Header (RPH) Registry Management Policy to IETF
  Review", Brian Rosen, 2013-02-11, <draft-rosen-rph-reg-policy-00.txt>

      RFC4412 defines "Resource-Priority Namespaces" and "Resource-Priority
      Priority-values" registries.  The management policy of these
      registries is "Standards Action".  This document changes the
      management policy of these registries to "IETF Review".

  "Updates to PSC", Eric Osborne, 2013-03-19,
  <draft-osborne-mpls-psc-updates-01.txt>

      This document contains four updates to RFC6378, "MPLS Transport
      Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection".  Two of them correct existing

  "User Defined Key Pair", Omar Omran, 2013-06-18,
  <draft-omar-tls-udkp-01.txt>

      In this document, I provide a high-level design for a new protocol in
      the application layer of the TCP/IP suite that will build a secure
      tunnel between the user's browser and the server without the
      involvement of any third party. My proposed protocol is called User-
      Defined Key Pair (UDKP), and its objective is to build a secure
      tunnel between the user's browser and the server using a
      public/private key pair generated for the user on the fly inside the
      user's browser based on the user credential information. This key
      pair will be used by the protocol instead of the server certificate
      as the starting point for creating the secure tunnel.

  "RPKI Repository Analysis and Requirements", Tim Bruijnzeels, Oleg
  Muravskiy, Bryan Weber, 2013-02-11,
  <draft-tbruijnzeels-sidr-repo-analysis-00.txt>

      The current RPKI Resource Certificate Repository Structure (RFC6480 &
      RFC6481) uses rsync as both a delta and transfer protocol.  Concerns
      have been raised about the scalability of this repository and the
      reliance on rsync.  This document provides an analysis of these
      concerns and formulates requirements for future work.

  "Channel Binding Signalling for the Generic Security Services
  Application Programming Interface", Nico Williams, 2013-02-22,
  <draft-williams-kitten-channel-bound-flag-02.txt>

      This Internet-Draft proposes the addition of a "channel bound" return
      flag for the GSS_Init_sec_context() and GSS_Accept_sec_context()
      functions.  Two behaviors are specified: a default, safe behavior,
      and a behavior that is only safe when the application specifically
      tells the Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface
      (GSS-API) that it (the applicaiton) supports the new behavior.

  "Authentication Context Certificate Extension", Stefan Santesson,
  2013-03-11, <draft-santesson-auth-context-extension-04.txt>

      This document defines an extension to certificates according to
      [RFC5280]. The extension defined in this document holds data about
      how the certificate subject was authenticated by the Certification
      Authority who issued the certificate where this extension appears.
      
      This document also defines one data structure for inclusion in this
      extension that designed to hold information when the subject is
      authenticated using a SAML assertion [SAML].

  "BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute for UDP", KuiKe Building, Zhenbin
  Li, Nischal Sheth, Yiu Lee, Fan Yongbing, Rajiv Asati, 2013-07-02,
  <draft-xu-softwire-encaps-udp-01.txt>

      This document specifies a new Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Tunnel
      Type of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) tunnels.

  "Generic UDP Encapsulation for IP Tunneling", Lucy Yong, KuiKe Building,
  2013-02-25, <draft-yong-tsvwg-udp-encap-4-ip-tunneling-01.txt>

      This document describes a method for encapsulating the layer
      protocols within UDP at an IP network edge such that the payload
      protocol can be identified from the destination port value. The
      mechanism also allows for the source port to be used as the entropy
      field for the purpose of load balancing in environments such as
      Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) in the underlying IP network.
      
      Application of this technique is focused on tunneling payload
      network flows across IP networks in environments where load-
      balancing is required. No changes to the underlying IP network or
      the payload networks are required.

  "Third-Party ALTO Server Discovery Prototype Implementation and
  Testbed", Sebastian Kiesel, 2013-02-12,
  <draft-kiesel-alto-3pdisc-impl-00.txt>

      This document contains a prototype implementation for the third-party

  <draft-bardalai-ccamp-overlay-path-comp-01.txt>

      This document discusses various path computations approaches which
      are applicable to overlay networks [framework doc ref]. It discusses
      how the customer edge nodes uses the information advertised by the
      provider network to compute a path between two customer edge nodes or
      how it can request the provider network to compute a path and setup
      an end-2-end LSP.

  "DECADE: DECoupled Application Data Enroute", Richard Alimi, Akbar
  Rahman, Dirk Kutscher, Yang Yang, Haibin Song, Kostas Pentikousis,
  2013-06-10, <draft-alimi-protocol-01.txt>

      Content distribution applications, such as those those employing
      peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies, are widely used on the Internet and
      make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks.  Often,
      however, content distribution applications use network resources in a
      counter-productive manner.  One way to improve efficiency is to
      introduce storage capabilities within the network and enable
      cooperation between end-host and in-network content distribution
      mechanisms.  This is the capability provided by a DECADE-compatible
      system, which is introduced in this document.  DECADE enables
      applications to take advantage of in-network storage when
      distributing data objects as opposed to using solely end-to-end
      resources.  This document presents the underlying principles and key
      functionalities of such a system and illustrates operation through a
      set of examples.

  "Topology API Use Cases", Shane Amante, Jan Medved, Stefano Previdi,
  Thomas Nadeau, 2013-02-14, <draft-amante-i2rs-topology-use-cases-00.txt>

      This document describes use cases for gathering routing, forwarding
      and policy information, (hereafter referred to as topology
      information), about the network.  It describes several applications
      that need to view the topology of the underlying physical or logical
      network.  This document further demonstrates a need for a "Topology
      Manager" and related functions that collects topology data from
      network elements and other data sources, coalesces the collected data
      into a coherent view of the overall network topology, and normalizes
      the network topology view for use by clients -- namely, applications
      that consume topology information.

  "The Virtual Private Network (VPN) Service in ALTO: Use Cases,
  Requirements and Extensions", Michael Scharf, Vijay Gurbani, Greg
  Soprovich, Volker Hilt, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-scharf-alto-vpn-service-01.txt>

      The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is
      designed to allow entities with knowledge about the network
      infrastructure to export such information to applications that need
      to choose one or more resources from a candidate set.  This document
      provides motivation for using ALTO in a Virtual Private Network (VPN)
      environment.  We discuss use cases, requirements, and possible
      extensions to the base ALTO protocol that will be needed to support
      VPN services.

  "IKEv2 Security Gateway Discovery", Daniel Migault, Kostas Pentikousis,
  2013-02-14, <draft-mglt-ipsecme-security-gateway-discovery-00.txt,.pdf>

      Modern Virtual Private Network (VPN) services are typically deployed
      using several security gateways and are frequently accessed over a
      wireless network.  There are several reasons for such a deployment
      ranging from enhancing system resilience to improving performance.
      
      For example, in order to handle traffic efficiently and reduce the
      burden in the core network, the VPN service may be implemented in a
      distributed manner using multiple Security Gateways.  A mobile VPN
      End User is attached to one of them using a WLAN interface and over
      time is likely to change its Security Gateway of attachment.  In this
      case, in order to optimize the overall user Quality of Experience
      (QoE), a VPN End User should select the next most appropriate
      Security Gateway based on the characteristics of the available
      Security Gateways.  This draft specifies how a VPN End User can
      securely collect information about Security Gateways in its network
      neighborhood in order to optimize its VPN experience.

  "IANA Guidance for Managing the ULE Registry", Gorry Fairhurst,
  2013-06-18, <draft-fairhurst-ipdvb-ule-iana-03.txt>

      This document proposes an update to RFC 4326 to clarify and update
      the allocation rules for the Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation
      (ULE) next header registry.  This registry is used by ULE and Generic
      Stream Encapsulation (GSE) to record the codepoints of extension
      headers and protocols supported by these encapsulation protocols.

  "Negotiation of Extra Round Trip for Kerberos V5 Generic Security
  Services Mechanism", Nico Williams, Roland Dowdeswell, 2013-02-15,

      This Internet-Draft proposes an extension to the Kerberos V5 security
      mechanism for the Generic Security Services Application Programming
      Interface (GSS-API) for using an extra pair of security context
      tokens in order to recover from certain errors.  Other benefits
      include: user2user authentication, authenticated errors (in some
      cases), and more.

  "A Comparison of IPv6 over IPv4 Tunnel Mechanisms", S.J.M. Steffann,
  Iljitsch van Beijnum, Rick van Rein, 2013-05-31,
  <draft-steffann-tunnels-04.txt>

      This document provides an overview of various ways to tunnel IPv6
      packets over IPv4 networks.  It covers mechanisms in current use,
      touches on several mechanisms that are now only of historic interest,
      and discusses some newer tunnel mechanisms that are not (yet) widely
      used at the time of publication.  The goal of the document is helping
      people with an IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling need to select the mechanisms
      that may apply to them.

  "Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) / Multicast Listener
  Discovery (MLD)-Based Multicast Translation ("IGMP/MLD Translation")",
  Simon Perreault, Tina Tsou, 2013-02-15,
  <draft-perreault-pim-igmp-mld-translation-00.txt>

      This document describes translation between IGMP and MLD.  This
      allows single-stack multicast nodes to participate in multicast
      groups from a different address family.  Both sending and receiving
      is supported by this translation mechanism.  Both any-source and
      source-specific multicast (ASM and SSM) are supported as well.

  "Microloop prevention by introducting a local convergence delay",
  Stephane Litkowski, Bruno Decraene, Pierre Francois, 2013-02-15,
  <draft-litkowski-rtgwg-uloop-delay-00.txt>

      This document describes a mechanism for link-state routing protocols
      to prevent a subset of transient loops during topology changes.  It
      introduces a two-step convergence by introducing a delay between the
      network wide convergence and the node advertising the failure.  As
      the network wide convergence is delayed in case of down events, this
      mechanism can be used for planned maintenance or for unplanned outage
      provided a fast reroute mechanism is used in conjunction to convert a
      failure into a less urgent topology change.
      
      Simulation using real network topologies and costs, with pathological
      convergence behaviour, have been performed.  While the proposed
      mechanism does not provide a complete solution, it is simple and it
      solves an interesting fraction of the transient loops in the analyzed
      SP topologies.

  "IKEv2 Alternate Outer IP Address Extension", Daniel Migault,
  2013-02-15, <draft-mglt-ipsecme-alternate-outer-address-00.txt,.pdf>

      Current IKEv2 protocol has been designed to establish VPNs with the
      same outer IP addresses as those used for the IKEv2 channel.  This
      describes the alternate outer IP address extension, and IKEv2
      extension that enables the VPN End User to negotiate a VPN on
      different interfaces as those used for the IKEv2 channel.
      
      Thus, this extension makes possible a VPN End User with multiple
      interfaces to set an IPsec tunnel on each interface with a Security
      Gateway by using a single IKEv2 channel instead of using an IKEv2
      channel per interface.  Similarly, for distributed Security Gateways,
      it also makes possible to split the IKEv2 and IPsec traffic on
      different interfaces.

  "The WebSocket Protocol as a Transport for the Binary Floor Control
  Protocol (BFCP)", Victor Pascual, Robert Welbourn, Stephane Cazeaux,
  2013-02-15, <draft-pascual-dispatch-bfcp-websocket-00.txt>

      The WebSocket protocol enables two-way realtime communication between
      clients and servers.  This document specifies a new WebSocket sub-
      protocol as a reliable transport mechanism between Binary Floor
      Control Protocol (BFCP) entities to enable usage of BFCP in new
      scenarios.  This document normatively updates
      [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis] and
      [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4583bis]

  "Reporting Equivalent IPFIX Information Elements", Paul Aitken,
  2013-02-15, <draft-aitken-ipfix-equivalent-ies-00.txt>

      This document proposes a method for IPFIX Exporting Processes
      to inform Collecting Processes of equivalent Information
      Elements, so that the Collecting Process can understand the
      equivalence and be enabled to process data across a change of
      Information Elements.

  "IS-IS Support for Unidirectional Links", Les Ginsberg, Sina Mirtorabi,
  Stefano Previdi, Abhay Roy, 2013-07-13, <draft-ginsberg-isis-udl-01.txt>

      This document defines support for the operation of IS-IS over
      Unidirectional Links without the use of tunnels or encapsulation of
      IS-IS Protocol Data Units.  Adjacency establishment when the return
      path from the router at the receive end of a unidirectional link to
      the router at the transmit end of the unidirectional link is via
      another unidirectional link is supported.  The extensions defined
      here are backwards compatible - only the routers directly connected
      to a unidirectional link need to be upgraded.

  "Ruoska Encoding", JPM, 2013-03-21, <draft-ruoska-encoding-04.txt>

      This document describes hierarchically structured binary encoding
      format called the Ruoska Encoding (RSK).  The main design goals are
      minimal resource usage, well defined structured with good selection
      of widely known data types, and still extendable for future usage.
      
      The main benefit when compared to non binary hierarchically
      structured formats like XML is simplicity and minimal resource
      demands.  Even basic XML parsing is time and memory consuming
      operation.
      
      When compared to other binary formats like encoding formats of ASN.1
      the main benefit is simplicity.  ASN.1 with different encondings is
      complex and even simple implementation needs a lot of effort.

  "PCP Server Discovery based on well-known IP Address", Sebastian Kiesel,
  Reinaldo Penno, 2013-02-16, <draft-kiesel-pcp-ip-based-srv-disc-00.txt>

      The Port Control Protocol (PCP) provides a mechanism to control how
      incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices such as Network
      Address Translator IPv6/IPv4 (NAT64), Network Address Translator
      IPv4/IPv4 (NAT44), IPv6 and IPv4 firewall devices, and a mechanism to
      reduce application keep alive traffic.
      
      This document establishes a well-known IP address for the PCP Server
      and documents how PCP clients embedded in endpoints can use it during
      the discovery and regular operation phases.

  "A YANG Data Model for LMAP Measurement Agents", Jürgen Schönwälder,
  2013-02-16, <draft-schoenw-lmap-yang-00.txt>

      This document sketches a data model for configuring and scheduling
      tests for large scale broadband access network measurements.  The
      data model is defined using the YANG data modeling language.

  "Considerations on using NETCONF with LMAP Measurement Agents", Jürgen
  Schönwälder, 2013-02-16, <draft-schoenw-lmap-netconf-00.txt>

      This document discusses how the NETCONF protocol can be used to
      configure LMAP measurement agents.

  "A Near Term Solution for Home IP Networking (HIPnet)", Chris
  Grundemann, Chris Donley, John Brzozowski, Lee Howard, Victor Kuarsingh,
  2013-02-25, <draft-grundemann-homenet-hipnet-01.txt>

      Home networks are becoming more complex.  With the launch of new
      services such as home security, IP video, Smart Grid, etc., many
      Service Providers are placing additional IPv4/IPv6 routers on the
      subscriber network.  This document describes a self-configuring home
      router that is capable of operating in such an environment, and that
      requires no user interaction to configure it.  Compliant with
      draft-ietf-homenet-arch, it uses existing protocols in new ways
      without the need for a routing protocol.

  "Negotiating Human Language Using SDP", Randy, 2013-02-24,
  <draft-gellens-negotiating-human-language-02.txt>

      Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities, and
      preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.  When
      establishing interactive communication "calls" there needs to be a
      way to communicate and ideally match (i.e., negotiate) the caller's
      language needs, abilities, and preferences with the capabilities of
      the called party.  This is especially important with emergency
      calling, where a call can be routed to a PSAP or call taker capable
      of communicating with the user, or a translator or relay operator can
      be bridged into the call during setup, but this applies to non-
      emergency calls as well (as an example, when calling an airline
      reservation desk).
      
      This document describes the need and expected use, and discusses the
      solution using either an existing or new SDP attribute.

  "On the Validation of TCP Sequence Numbers", Fernando Gont, David
  Borman, 2013-02-16, <draft-gont-tcpm-tcp-seq-validation-00.txt>

      When TCP receives packets that lie outside of the receive window, the
      corresponding packets are dropped and either an ACK, RST or no
      response is generated due to the out-of-window packet, with no
      further processing of the packet.  Most of the time, this works just
      fine and TCP remains stable, especially when a TCP connection has
      unidirectional data flow.  However, there are three scenarios in
      which packets that are outside of the receive window should still
      have their ACK field processed, or else a packet war will take place.
      The aforementioned issues have affected a number of popular TCP
      implementations, typically leading to connection failures, system
      crashes, or other undesirable behaviors.  This document describes the
      three scenarios in which the aforementioned issues might arise, and
      formally updates RFC 793 such that these potential problems are
      mitigated.

  "The Incident Object Description Exchange Format", Roman Danyliw, Paul
  Stoecker, 2013-02-16, <draft-stoecker-danyliw-rfc5070bis-00.txt>

      The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a
      data representation that provides a framework for sharing information
      commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams
      (CSIRTs) about computer security incidents.  This document describes
      the information model for the IODEF and provides an associated data
      model specified with XML Schema.

  "Integration Examples of DECADE System", Ning Zong, Xiaohui Chen,
  Zhigang Huang, Lijiang Chen, Hongqiang Liu, 2013-02-16,
  <draft-zong-integration-example-00.txt>

      Decoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) system is an in-network
      storage infrastructure which was discussed in IETF.  This document
      presents two detailed examples of how to integrate such in-network
      storage infrastructure into peer-to-peer (P2P) applications to
      achieve more efficient content distribution, and Application Layer
      Traffic Optimization (ALTO) system to build a content distribution
      platform for Content Providers (CPs).

  "Use case of IPv6 prefix semantics for operators", Qiong Sun, Qiong Sun,
  Sheng Jiang, 2013-02-25, <draft-sun-v6ops-semantic-usecase-01.txt>

      Embedding certain semantics into IPv6 addresses will bring a lot of
      benifits for operators to simplify network management and apply
      operations accordingly[I-D.jiang-semantic-prefix].  This memo
      illustrates the use case of semantic bits from operator's point of
      view, and provides considerations on how to design the semantic bits
      in IPv6 address.

  "Tenant system information discovery approaches Gap analysis", Liang
  Xia, Qin Wu, 2013-06-28, <draft-wu-nvo3-mac-learning-arp-03.txt>

      This document analyzes various protocol solutions for tenant system
      information (e.g.  MAC, IP, etc) discovery in the virtualization
      environment (e.g.,MAC in MAC, MAC in IP, IP in IP) and identifies the
      gap against NVO3 control plane and data plane requirements.

  "Load-balancing to Data Centers in a L3VPN environment based on Power",
  Balaji Venkataswami, Bhargav Bhikkaji, Shankar Raman, 2013-02-17,
  <draft-balaji-panet-dc-label-semantic-for-pwr-00.txt>

      Data Centers may be spread across different locations for a
      particular enterprise. Different locations may mean within the same
      country but across different geographical locations, or outside the
      country even in a different continent. These data centers may be
      serving the enterprise or multiple enterprises / tenants wherein the
      regular enterprise site may request data from a data center site
      which could be one of the data center sites proximal to the
      enterprise site. Proximity is usually calculated based on a metric
      that is bandwidth driven or in terms with regard to the number of
      hops to reach that data center site hence bringing into play delay
      characteristics. Assume a topology where the data center sites and
      the enterprise sites are MPLS based L3VPN sites that are being
      provided connectivity through a Service Provider deploying Layer 3
      VPNs. Given such a topology it is possible that replication of data
      happens across the data centers in a timely manner to keep the data
      active and refreshed across all data center sites. Suitable
      mechanisms for such replication will come into play for this purpose.
      Thus any of the data centers can cater to the request from a user
      site.
      
      It is possible that power consumption in each data center may vary
      according to the load on each data center. It would be prudent to
      introduce a scheme where the power metric coupled with other metrics
      such as bandwidth and delay be used by a Provider Edge router in a
      L3VPN scenario to direct the packets or requests from regular user
      sites to such data centers with the least such metric. This is in
      line with the follow-the-moon strategy of directing requests for data
      and compute to data centers which are power-wise more efficient
      during the night or during the day. This draft document lays out one
      such proposal.

  "SCTP Overlay link for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD)", Marc
  Petit-Huguenin, 2013-02-17,
  <draft-petithuguenin-p2psip-reload-sctp-00.txt>

      This document defines two new Overlay Link protocols to be used with
      REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), both using SCTP.  The
      Overlay Link protocol DTLS-SCTP-NO-ICE uses DTLS on top of native
      SCTP for overlays that do not require the use of ICE.  The Overlay
      Link protocol DTLS-SCTP-UDP uses DTLS on top of an UDP encapsulation
      of SCTP for overlays that require the use of ICE.

  "Additional Policies for the Partial Delivery Extension of the Stream
  Control Transmission Protocol", Salvatore Loreto, Robin Seggelmann,
  Randall Stewart, Michael Tuexen, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-tuexen-tsvwg-sctp-prpolicies-02.txt>

      This document defines policies for the Partial Reliability Extension
      of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (PR-SCTP) allowing to
      limit the number of retransmissions or to prioritize user messages
      for more efficient send buffer usage.

  "TRILL: Vendor Specific TRILL Channel Protocol", Donald Eastlake, Li
  Yizhou, Hao Weiguo, Ayan Banerjee, 2013-02-17,
  <draft-eastlake-trill-vendor-channel-00.txt>

      The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
      protocol is implemented by devices called TRILL switches or RBridges
      (Routing Bridges). TRILL includes a general mechanism, called RBridge
      Channel, for the transmission of typed messages between RBridges in
      the same campus and between RBridges and end stations on the same
      link. This document specifies how to send vendor specific messages
      over the RBridge Channel facility.

  "A One-Way Loss Metric for IPPM", Guy Almes, Sunil Kalidindi, Matthew
  Zekauskas, Al Morton, 2013-02-17, <draft-morton-ippm-2680-bis-00.txt>

      This memo (RFC 2680 bis) defines a metric for one-way loss of packets
      across Internet paths.  It builds on notions introduced and discussed
      in the IPPM Framework document, RFC 2330; the reader is assumed to be
      familiar with that document.

  "IPv6 Delegated Prefix Verification Tool", Shishio Tsuchiya, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-shishio-v6ops-dpvt-01.txt>

      IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6
      (DHCP-PD) and IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) are technology to provide
      IPv6 prefix, not IPv6 address themselves.
      
      Delegated Prefix are controlled by Customer Premise Equipment (CPE)
      and 6rd Customer Edge (6rd CE).  The service provider can not confirm
      utilization of delegated prefix on CE and CPE.
      
      This document describes mechanism of verification for delegated
      prefix on CPE and CE from service provider side.

  "OSPF Extensions for Automatic Computation of MPLS Traffic Engineering
  Path Using Traffic Engineering Layers and Areas", Zhenbin Li, Li Zhang,
  Yuanjiao Liu, 2013-02-17, <draft-li-ospf-auto-mbb-te-path-00.txt>

      As the network scale expands, especially in the mobile backhaul
      network, automatic computation of MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) path
      becomes very important.  But owing to requirements on the MPLS TE
      path, explicit path or affinity property has to be introduced for the
      path computation.  This causes the complexity of MPLS TE path design.
      The document proposes an architecture and corresponding OSPF
      extensions to improve automation on computation of MPLS TE path.
      MPLS TE networks are divided into different traffic engineering
      layers and areas according to the characteristics of the network
      topology.  MPLS TE path can compute automatically based on traffic
      engineering layers and areas to satisfy major requirements to bear
      mobile network services.

  "OSPF Extensions for MPLS Green Traffic Engineering", Gang Yan, Jianjun
  Yang, Zhenbin Li, 2013-02-17, <draft-li-ospf-ext-green-te-00.txt>

      The energy-saving is one important topic in the world, and now most
      of technology for energy-saving is related with the hardware design
      instead of that based on the whole network.  This document proposes
      OSPF extensions to synchronize the energy-saving parameter of each
      node in the network which will be considered when the LSP path is
      calculated.

  "Alternative Constraints for Point-to-Multipoint Traffic-Engineered MPLS
  Label Switched Paths(LSPs)", Zhenbin Li, Tieying Huang, 2013-02-17,
  <draft-li-mpls-p2mp-te-alt-path-00.txt>

      The document proposes a solution to be able to set up the alternative
      path for specific leaf nodes of a P2MP TE LSP.  Corresponding RSVP-TE
      protocol extension is also defined.  The solution is used to cope
      with the issue that in some scenarios traffic loss happens even if
      there exists possible path for the leaf nodes.

  "PAWS Database Discovery", Xinpeng Wei, Lei Zhu, 2013-05-21,

  "IPv6 Source/Destination Routing using OSPFv3", Fred Baker, 2013-05-02,
  <draft-baker-ipv6-ospf-dst-src-routing-02.txt>

      This note describes the changes necessary for OSPFv3 to route classes
      of IPv6 traffic that are defined by an IPv6 source prefix and a
      destination prefix.  This implies not simply routing "to a
      destination", but "traffic going to that destination AND coming from
      a specified source".  It may be combined with other qualifying
      attributes, such as "traffic going to that destination AND using a
      specified flow label AND from a specified source prefix".  The
      obvious application is egress routing, as required for a multihomed
      entity with a provider-allocated prefix from each of several upstream
      networks.  Traffic within the network could be source/destination
      routed as well, or could be routed from "any prefix", ::/0.  If
      traffic is routed from the relevant PA prefixes but in fact has a
      source address that is in none of them, the traffic in effect has no
      route.

  "Using OSPFv3 with Role-Based Access Control", Fred Baker, 2013-05-02,
  <draft-baker-ipv6-ospf-dst-flowlabel-routing-02.txt>

      This note describes the changes necessary for OSPFv3 to route classes
      of IPv6 traffic that are defined by an IPv6 Flow Label and a
      destination prefix.  This implies not simply routing "to a
      destination", but "traffic going to that destination AND using a
      specified flow label".  It may be combined with other qualifying
      attributes, such as "traffic going to that destination AND using a
      specified flow label AND from a specified source prefix".  The
      obvious application is data center inter-tenant routing using a form
      of role-based access control.  If the sender doesn't know the value
      to insert in the flow label (the receiver's tenant ID), it in effect
      has no route to that destination, thus providing an access list that
      is as changeable and scalable as routing.

  "Using IS-IS with Role-Based Access Control", Fred Baker, 2013-02-17,
  <draft-baker-ipv6-isis-dst-flowlabel-routing-00.txt>

      This note describes the changes necessary for IS-IS to route classes
      of IPv6 traffic that are defined by an IPv6 Flow Label and a
      destination prefix.  This implies not routing "to a destination", but
      "traffic matching a classification tuple".  The obvious application
      is data center inter-tenant routing using a form of role-based access
      control.  If the sender doesn't know the value to insert in the flow
      label (the receiver's tenant ID), he in effect has no route to that
      destination.

  "IPv6 Source/Destination Routing using IS-IS", Fred Baker, 2013-02-17,
  <draft-baker-ipv6-isis-dst-src-routing-00.txt>

      This note describes the changes necessary for IS-IS to route classes
      of IPv6 traffic that are defined by a source prefix and a destination
      prefix.  This implies not routing "to a destination", but "traffic
      matching a classification tuple".  The obvious application is egress
      routing - routing traffic using a given prefix to an upstream network
      that will not drop traffic using that prefix using BCP 38 filters.

  "Hybrid-MAC Model for CAPWAP", Chunju Shao, Hui Deng, Farooq Bari, Rong
  Zhang, Satoru Matsushima, 2013-02-17,
  <draft-shao-opsawg-capwap-hybridmac-00.txt>

      The CAPWAP protocol supports two modes of operation: Split and Local
      MAC (medium access control), which has been described in
      [RFC5415].There are many functions in IEEE 802l.11 MAC layer that
      have not yet been clearly defined whether they belong to either the
      AP (Access Point) or the AC (Access Controller)in the Split and Local
      modes.  Because different vendors have their own definition of these
      two models, depending upon the vendor many MAC layer functions
      continue to be mapped differently to either the AP or AC.  If there
      is no clear definition of split MAC and local MAC, then operators
      will not only need to perform vendor specific configurations in their
      network but will continue to experience difficulty in interoperating
      APs and ACs from different vendors.

  "Analysis of NAT64 Port Allocation Method", Gang Chen, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-chen-sunset4-cgn-port-allocation-02.txt>

      The document enumerates methods of port assignment in CGN contexts,
      more focusing on a NAT64 environment.  The analysis categorizes the
      different methods with several key features.  The uses of existing
      protocols are further described corresponding to those features.
      This memo also states the port-usage experiences, relevant findings,
      evaluations and workarounds.  It's expected the document could
      provide an informative base line to help operators choosing a proper
      method.

      the service provider networks and its associated engineering
      requirements.  The framework is referred to as the virtual network
      element framework (VNEF) in the document.

  "Using DMARC", Dave Crocker, 2013-04-29,
  <draft-crocker-dmarc-bcp-02.txt>

      Email abuse often relies on unauthorized use of a domain name, such
      as one belonging to a well-known company (brand).  SPF and DKIM
      provide basic domain name authentication methods for email.  A recent
      industry effort built an additional authentication-based layer,
      called Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance
      (DMARC).  It allows a sender to indicate that their emails are
      protected by SPF and/or DKIM, and tells a receiver what to do if
      neither of those authentication methods passes; it also provides a
      reporting mechanism, from receivers back to domain owners.  Such
      capabilities over the public Internet are unusual and their use is
      not yet well-understood.  This document formulates a set of best
      practices for the use of DMARC.

      architecture.

  "Extension to Purge Initiator Identification TLV for ISIS in TRILL",
  Gang Chen, 2013-07-15, <draft-chen-trill-isis-purge-01.txt>

      This memo specified an extension of ISIS TLV for identifying purge
      initiator in TRILL environments.  With the extension, it's beneficial
      for operators to nail down the root cause when there is a corrupted
      Link State Protocol (LSP) data unit spread within a layer-2 network.
      The defined TLV is expected to record Nickname and impacted VLAN
      information.  RBridge should propagate the TLV information without
      changes in order to flood the information.

  "PMIPv6 Multicast Routing Optimization with PIM-SM", Hitoshi Asaeda,
  Pierrick Seite, 2013-02-17,
  <draft-asaeda-multimob-pmip6-ropt-with-pim-00.txt>

      This document describes IP multicast routing optimization with PIM-SM
      in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) environment.  The Mobile Access Gateway
      (MAG) and the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) are the mobility entities

      provides background on the RAC as well as explaining the proposed
      restructuring and the rationale.

  "Differentiated Service Class Recommendations for LLN Traffic",
  Shitanshu Shah, Pascal Thubert, 2013-02-17,
  <draft-svshah-tsvwg-lln-diffserv-recommendations-00.txt>

      Differentiated services architecture is widely deployed in
      traditional networks.  There exist well defined recommendations for
      the use of appropriate differentiated service classes for different
      types of traffic (eg. audio, video) in these networks.  Per-Hop
      Behaviors are typically defined based on this recommendations.  With
      emerging Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), it is important to have
      similar defined differentiated services recommendations for LLN
      traffic.  Defined recommendations are for LLN class of traffic
      exiting out of LLNs towards high-speed backbones, converged campus
      network and for the traffic in the reverse direction.

  "Routing Extensions for Discovery of Role-based MPLS Label Switching
  Router (MPLS LSR) Traffic Engineering (TE) Mesh Membership", Zhenbin Li,
  Mach Chen, 2013-02-17, <draft-li-ccamp-role-based-automesh-00.txt>

      A Traffic Engnieering (TE) mesh-group is defined as a group of Label
      Switch Routers (LSRs) that are connected by a full mesh of TE LSPs.
      Routing (OSPF and IS-IS) extensions for discovery Multiprotocol Label
      Switching (MPLS) LSR TE mesh membership has been defined to automate
      the creation of mesh of TE LSPs.
      
      This document introduces a role-based TE mesh-group that applies to
      the scenarios where full mesh TE LSPs are not necessary and TE LSPs
      setup depends on the roles of LSRs in a TE mesh-group.  Interior
      Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing extensions for automatic discovery of
      role-based TE mesh membership are defined accordingly.

      addressed or mitigated.

  "Variant Label Resource Record", Yoshiro Yoneya, 2013-02-24,
  <draft-yoneya-dns-variant-label-rr-01.txt>

      Definition and operation of variant domain names are differ from zone
      administrators, and there is no generic rules, therefore, in general,
      it is hard to guess variant labels for end users and / or
      applications.  Meanwhile, zone administrators are understanding all
      variant labels list because they generate variant labels and activate
      them according to rules they defined.  Thus, if there is a mechanism
      that end users and / or applications can obtain variant labels list
      from zone administrators, then it would be useful.  The Variant
      Labels Resource Record (VL RR) provides such variant labels list for
      that purpose.

  "Coloring based IP Flow Performance Measurement Framework", Mach Chen,
  Hongming Liu, Yuanbin Yin, 2013-02-24,
  <draft-chen-coloring-based-ipfpm-framework-01.txt>

      By setting one unused bit of the IP header of packets to "color" the
      packets into different color blocks, it naturally gives a way to
      measure the real packet loss and delay without inserting any extra
      OAM packets.  This is called "coloring" based IP Flow Performance
      Measurement (IPFPM).  This document specifies a framework and
      protocol for this "coloring" based IPFPM.

  "RTP/RTCP extension for RTP Splicing Notification", Jinwei Xia, Rachel
  Huang, 2013-02-20, <draft-xia-avtext-splicing-notification-01.txt>

      Content splicing is a process that replaces the content of a main
      multimedia stream with other multimedia content, and delivers the
      substitutive multimedia content to the receivers for a period of
      time.  The RTP mixer is designed to handle RTP splicing in [RFC6828],
      but how the RTP mixer knows when to start and end the splicing is
      still unspecified.
      
      This memo defines two RTP/RTCP extensions to indicate the splicing
      related information to the RTP mixer: an RTP header extension that
      conveys the information in-band and an RTCP packet that conveys the
      information out-of-band.

  stateful PCE", Dhruv Dhody, Udayasree Palle, 2013-07-28,
  <draft-dhody-pce-stateful-pce-auto-bandwidth-02.txt>

      The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
      mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
      computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
      The extensions described in [STATEFUL-PCE] provide stateful control
      of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label

  "RADIUS Extensions for Key Management in WLAN network", Li Xue, Bo Gao,
  2013-07-11, <draft-xue-radext-key-management-01.txt>

      It is a general case in operators networks that Authenticator is
      deployed on Service Gateway (SGW) to avoid overload on the Access
      Controller (AC).  In this scenario, the encryption/decryption node
      can't obtain Pairwise Master Key (PMK) information during Extensible
      Authentication Protocol (EAP) procedure, it is not sufficent to
      achieve traffic encryption/decryption requirement in Wireless Local
      Area Network (WLAN) network.

      beneficially used.

  "Make-Before-Break MPLS-TE LSP restoration and reoptimization procedure
  using Stateful PCE", Yosuke Tanaka, Yuji Kamite, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-tanaka-pce-stateful-pce-mbb-01.txt>

      Stateful PCE (Path Computation Element) and its corresponding
      protocol extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do
      stateful control of MPLS Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
      LSP).  Stateful PCE supports manipulating the existing LSP's state
      and attributes (e.g., bandwidth and route) and also creating totally
      new LSPs in the network.
      
      In the current MPLS TE network using RSVP-TE, LSPs are often
      controlled by "make-before-break (M-B-B)" signaling by headend for
      the purpose of LSP restoration and reoptimization.  In most cases, it
      is an essential operation to reroute LSP traffic without any data
      disruption.
      
      This document specifies the procedure of applying stateful PCE's
      control to make-before-break RSVP-TE signaling.  In this document,
      two types of restoration/reoptimization procedures are defined,
      implicit mode and explicit mode.  This document also specifies the
      usage and handling of stateful PCEP (PCE Communication Protocol)
      messages, expected behavior of PCC as RSVP-TE headend and several
      extensions of additional PCEP objects.

  "Advertising MPLS labels in IGPs", Hannes Gredler, Shane Amante, Tom
  Scholl, Luay Jalil, 2013-05-15,
  <draft-gredler-rtgwg-igp-label-advertisement-05.txt>

      Historically MPLS label distribution was driven by session oriented
      protocols.  In order to obtain a particular routers label binding for
      a given destination FEC one needs to have first an established
      session with that node.
      
      This document describes a mechanism to distribute FEC/label mappings
      through flooding protocols.  Flooding protocols publish their objects
      for an unknown set of receivers, therefore one can efficiently scale
      label distribution for use cases where the receiver of label
      information is not directly connected.
      
      Application of this technique are found in the field of backup
      (Bypass, R-LFA) routing, Label switched path stitching, egress
      protection, explicit routing and egress ASBR link selection.

  "Large scale Measurement of Access network Performance (LMAP):
  Requirements and Issues from a Network Provider Perspective", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-boucadair-lmap-considerations-00.txt>

      This document raises several points related to the ongoing LMAP
      (Large scale Measurement of Access network Performance) effort.  The
      goal is to contribute to define a scope for LMAP and its expected
      contribution.

  "Simple VPN solution using Multi-point Security Association", Arifumi
  Yamaya, Ken Ueki, Tomoki Murai, Takafumi Ohya, Tomohiro Yamagata,
  2013-07-30, <draft-yamaya-ipsecme-mpsa-02.txt>

      This document describes the over-lay network solution by utilizing
      dynamically established IPsec multi-point Security Association (SA)
      without individual connection.
      
      Multi-point SA technology provides the simplified mechanism of the
      Auto Discovery and Configuration function.  This is applicable for
      any IPsec tunnels such as IPv4 over IPv4, IPv4 over IPv6, IPv6 over
      IPv4 and IPv6 over IPv6.

  "Priority Modification for the PSC Linear Protection", Jeong-dong Ryoo,
  Huub van Helvoort, Alessandro D'Alessandro, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-rhd-mpls-tp-psc-priority-00.txt>

      This document contains the modifications to the priorities of inputs
      in [RFC6378], "MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection" in
      an effort to satisfy the ITU-T's protection switching requirements
      and correcting the problems that have been identified.

  "Structured Access Token for Sharing Authorization Grant between a
  Resource Server and an Authorization Server", Nat Sakimura, Boku Kihara,
  Kazuki Shimizu, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-sakimura-oidc-structured-token-01.txt>

      This specification defines a format of structured access tokens that
      are issued by the authorization server and received by the resource
      server. By using this format, the authorization server and the
      resource server can be easily separated and the validation of the
      access token can be performed offline.

  "Access Token as per Client Password for Non-Web Protocols", Nat
  Sakimura, Boku Kihara, Kazuki Shimizu, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-sakimura-oidc-extension-nonweb-01.txt>

      This specification describes the usage of the access token as a per
      client "password" for non-web clients that utilizes password based
      authentication, and the mechanism to issue such access tokens. Since
      the access token is used as the password for the client, the existing
      client application can be used as-is without any change, which is a
      considerable advantage for the deployment.

  "Loss and Delay Measurement in Transparent Interconnection of Lots of
  Links (TRILL)", Tal Mizrahi, Tissa Senevirathne, Samer Salam, Deepak
  Kumar, Donald Eastlake, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-mizrahi-trill-loss-delay-01.txt>

      Performance Monitoring (PM) is a key aspect of Operations,
      Administration and Maintenance (OAM). It allows network operators to
      verify the Service Level Agreement (SLA) provided to customers, and
      to detect network anomalies. This document specifies mechanisms for
      Loss Measurement (LM) and Delay Measurement (DM) in TRILL networks.

  "ALTO for Querying LMAP Results", Jan Seedorf, Vijay Gurbani, Enrico
  Marocco, 2013-07-11, <draft-seedorf-lmap-alto-01.txt>

      In the context of Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance
      (LMAP), measurement results are currently made available to the
      public either at the finest granularity level (e.g. as a list of
      results of all individual tests), or in a very high level human-
      readable format (e.g. as PDF reports).
      
      This document argues that there is a need for an intermediate way to
      provide access to large-scale network measurement results, flexible
      enough to enable querying of specific and possibly aggregated data.
      The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol, defined
      with the goal to provide applications with network information, seems
      a good candidate to fulfill such a role.

  "A Google Congestion Control Algorithm for Real-Time Communication",
  Stefan Holmer, Harald Alvestrand, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-alvestrand-rmcat-congestion-00.txt>

      This document describes two methods of congestion control when using
      real-time communications on the World Wide Web (RTCWEB); one sender-
      based and one receiver-based.
      
      It is published as an input document to the RMCAT working group on
      congestion control for media streams.  The mailing list of that WG is
      rmcat@ietf.org.

  "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) Option for IPv4
  Configuration", Qi Sun, Yong Cui, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-sun-dhc-dhcpv6-opt-v4config-00.txt>

      This document defines a DHCPv6 option with two types of sub-options
      for IPv4 configurations in the case of IPv4/IPv6 transition.  One is
      used for the assignment of IPv4 address and port set, the other is
      used for configuring existing DHCPv4 options required by clients for
      IPv4-over-IPv6 communications.

  "IEEE 802.21 Overview", Juan Zuniga, Pierrick Seite, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-zuniga-mif-802-21-overview-00.txt>

      Some of the messages described in [I-D.ietf-mif-api-extension] may
      rely on functionalties provided by lower layers.  The IEEE 802.21
      specification defines an abstraction of lower layer functions that
      can be useful for the MIF-API.  This document provides an overview of
      the 802.21 specification and enumerates a subset of functions that
      can be used in the context of the MIF API to interact with lower
      layers.

  "<Opportunistic Linked-Increases Congestion Control Algorithm for
  MPTCP>", Ramin Khalili, Nicolas Gast, Miroslav Popovic, Jean-Yves Le
  Boudec, 2013-07-15, <draft-khalili-mptcp-congestion-control-01.txt>

      This document describes the mechanism of OLIA, the "opportunistic
      linked increases algorithm". OLIA is a congestion control algorithm
      for MPTCP. The current congestion control algorithm of MPTCP, LIA,
      forces a tradeoff between optimal congestion balancing and
      responsiveness. OLIA's design departs from this tradeoff and provide
      these properties simultaneously. Hence, it solves the identified
      performance problems with LIA while retaining non-flappiness and
      responsiveness behavior of LIA [5] and [9].

  "A New Data Chunk for Stream Control Transmission Protocol", Randall
  Stewart, Michael Tuexen, Salvatore Loreto, Robin Seggelmann, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-stewart-tsvwg-sctp-ndata-02.txt>

      The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a message oriented
      transport protocol supporting arbitrary large user messages.
      However, the sender can not interleave different user messages which
      which causes head of line blocking at the sender side.  To overcome
      this limitation, this document adds a new data chunk to SCTP.

  "Diameter Congestion and Filter Attributes", Brent Hirschman, Lyle
  Bertz, 2013-02-18, <draft-bertz-dime-congestion-flow-attributes-00.txt>

      This document defines ECN and filter related attributes that can be
      used for improved traffic identification, support of ECN and
      minimized filter administration within Diameter.
      
      RFC 5777 defines a Filter-Rule AVP that accommodates extensions for
      classification, conditions and actions. It does not support traffic
      identification for packets using Explicit Congestion Notification as
      defined in RFC 3168 and does not provide specific actions when the
      flow(s) described by the Filter-Rule are congested.
      
      A Filter-Rule can describe multiple flows but not the exact number of
      flows. Flow count and other associated data (e.g. packets) is not
      captured in Accounting applications, leaving administrators without
      useful information regarding the effectiveness or understanding of
      the filter definition.

  "WebRTC audio codecs for interoperability with legacy networks.", Xavier
  Marjou, Stephane Proust, Kalyani Bogineni, Roland Jesske, Miao Lei,
  Enrico Marocco, Espen Berger, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-marjou-rtcweb-audio-codecs-for-interop-01.txt>

      This document presents use-cases underlining why WebRTC needs AMR-WB,
      AMR and G.722 as additional relevant voice codecs to satisfactorily
      ensure interoperability with existing systems.  It also presents a
      way forward that takes into consideration the concerns expressed
      against the addition of codecs besides Opus and G.711.
      
      It is especially recognized that unjustified additional costs on
      browsers must be avoided.  Therefore, the proposed solution intends
      to fully rely on the codecs already supported on the devices
      implementing the browsers and for which license and implementation
      costs have been already paid.
      
      It is expected that this way forward will significantly limit the
      costs and technical impacts on browsers while greatly improving
      interoperability with legacy systems and overall quality.  It intents
      to be considered as a good compromise beneficial to all parties and
      to the whole industry: the user quality experience will be optimized
      as a whole at limited additional costs without incurring high costs
      for both networks to support transcoding and browsers to support
      additional codecs.

  "Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extension
  for Label Switched Path (LSP) Inquiry", Zafar Ali, George Swallow,
  Clarence Filsfils, Ori Gerstel, Matt Hartley, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-ali-ccamp-lsp-inquiry-00.txt>

      RSVP-TE reoptimization procedure for Packet Switch Capable (PSC)
      tunnels and non-PSC tunnels has some differences. This document
      highlights these differences, describes how existing procedures can
      be used for reoptimization of non-PSC tunnels and proposes some
      enhancements for reoptimization of non-PSC tunnels.

  "PIM Extensions for Protection Using Maximally Redundant Trees", Robert
  Kebler, Alia Atlas, Naiming Shen, Yiqun Cai, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-kebler-pim-mrt-protection-01.txt>

      This document specifies Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
      procedures for Failure Protection, as specified in the MRT Multicast
      architecture [I-D.atlas-rtwg-mrt-mc-arch].  This can be accomplished
      with Global Repair (aka Live-Live) or with Local Repair (aka Fast Re-
      route).  Maximally Redundant Trees (MRTs) provide the capability to
      PIM to provide alternate paths around any given failure.

  "Network Proxy Protocol", Sangjin Jeong, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-jeong-eman-network-proxy-protocol-01.txt>

      In the current Internet, it is implicitly assumed that a network node
      is always active so that it can receive the incoming packets at any
      time.  Current networking services and applications are commonly
      designed to be fully available at all times with minimal response
      times.  This assumption keeps network nodes from entering sleeping
      mode in order to reduce energy consumption.  Further, during sleeping
      mode, network nodes may not immediately respond to the incoming
      packets or even lose them.  If network nodes are allowed to go into a
      sleeping mode, they can effectively reduce energy consumption during
      idle period.  Network proxy allows to delegate network node's traffic
      processing to an external system within a network, so that the nodes
      maintain network presence during their sleep.  This document
      describes communication mechanism between network nodes and proxy in
      order to accelerate the wider deployment of network proxy mechanism.

  "Securing the IP-based Internet of Things with DTLS", Sye Keoh, Sandeep
  Kumar, Oscar Garcia-Morchon, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-keoh-lwig-dtls-iot-01.txt>

      The IP-based Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the pervasive
      interaction of smart devices and people enabling new applications by
      means of IP protocols. Traditional IP protocols will be further
      complemented by 6LoWPAN and CoAP to make the IoT feasible on small
      devices. Security and privacy are a must for such an environment. Due
      to mobility, limited bandwidth, resource constraints, and new
      communication topologies, existing security solutions need to be
      adapted. We propose a security architecture for the IoT in order to
      provide network access control to smart devices, the management of
      keys and securing unicast/multicast communication. Devices are
      authenticated and granted network access by means of a pre-shared key
      (PSK) based security handshake protocol. The solution is based on
      Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). Through the established
      secure channels, keying materials, operational and security
      parameters are distributed, enabling devices to derive session keys
      and group keys. The solution relies on the DTLS Record Layer for the
      protection of unicast and multicast data flows. We have prototyped
      and evaluated the security architecture. The DTLS architecture allows
      for easier interaction and interoperability with the Internet due to
      the extensive use of TLS. However, it exhibits performance issues
      constraining its deployment in some network topologies and hence
      would require further optimizations.

  "UDP Entropy Tunnel for Softwire", Carlos Pignataro, Nagendra Kumar,
  Pradosh Mohapatra, Clarence Filsfils, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-kumar-softwire-uet-00.txt>

      This document describes a method for encapsulatation of tunneled
      packets within UDP in order to provide per-flow entropy for load-
      balancing.  The method is targeted for use with softwire mesh
      deployments that include routers which have support for load-
      balancing based on UDP ports and not fields in L2TPv3 or GRE.

  "Integrity Check Value and Timestamp TLV Definitions for Mobile Ad Hoc
  Networks (MANETs)", Ulrich Herberg, Thomas Clausen, Christopher
  Dearlove, 2013-03-18, <draft-herberg-manet-rfc6622-bis-02.txt>

      This document extends and replaces RFC 6622.  It describes general
      and flexible TLVs for representing cryptographic Integrity Check
      Values (ICVs) (i.e., digital signatures or Message Authentication
      Codes (MACs)) as well as timestamps, using the generalized Mobile Ad
      Hoc Network (MANET) packet/message format defined in RFC 5444.  It
      defines two Packet TLVs, two Message TLVs, and two Address Block TLVs
      for affixing ICVs and timestamps to a packet, a message, and an
      address, respectively.

  "Integrity Protection for Control Messages in NHDP and OLSRv2", Ulrich
  Herberg, Christopher Dearlove, Thomas Clausen, 2013-03-18,
  <draft-herberg-manet-nhdp-olsrv2-sec-02.txt>

      This document specifies integrity and replay protection for required
      implementation in the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)
      and the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).
      This document specifies how an included integrity check value (ICV)
      and a timestamp TLV, defined in RFC6622bis, are used by NHDP and
      OLSRv2 for countering a number of security threats.  The ICV TLV uses
      a SHA-256 based HMAC and a single shared secret key.  The timestamp
      TLV is based on POSIX time, and assumes that the clocks in all
      routers in the network can be synchronized with sufficient precision.
      The mechanism in this specification can also be used for other MANET
      protocols using RFC5444.

  "Data Channels for RTCWEB", Martin Thomson, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-thomson-rtcweb-data-00.txt>

      RTCWEB have selected SCTP over DTLS over UDP with ICE for peer-to-
      peer data channels.  There is some debate over the best way to
      negotiate channels.  This proposal is a nose-to-tail description of
      an alternative to existing proposals.

  "CoAP Communication with Alternative Transports", Bilhanan Silverajan,
  Teemu Savolainen, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-silverajan-core-coap-alternative-transports-02.txt>

      CoAP is being standardised as an application level REST-based
      protocol.  A single CoAP message is typically encapsulated and
      transmitted using UDP.  This draft examines the requirements and
      possible solutions for conveying CoAP packets to end points over
      alternative transports to UDP.  UDP remains the optimal solution for
      CoAP use in IP-based constrained environments and nodes.  However the
      need for M2M communication using non-IP networks, improved transport
      level end-to-end reliability and security, NAT and firewall traversal
      issues, and mechanisms possibly incurring a lower overhead to CoAP/
      HTTP translation gateways provide compelling motivation for
      understanding how CoAP can operate in various other environments.

  "DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options for Access Point Location Information", Li
  Xue, Behcet Sarikaya, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-xue-dhcp-location-option-00.txt>

      This document introduces Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access
      Points Wireless Termination Point information transported using DHCP.
      In this procedure, DHCP snooping is deployed on the Wireless
      Termination Point node or Access Controller node.  Then the Wireless
      Termination Point information can be inserted into the DHCP message
      in extension option.  Because the DHCP messages is send out from the
      subscriber, so binding between Wireless Termination Point information
      and subscriber is set up after this procedure.  Then Gateway obtains
      the Wireless Termination Point information through the subscriber
      access network.

  "UNI Extensions for Diversity and Latency Support", Don Fedyk, Dieter
  Beller, Lieven Levrau, Daniele Ceccarelli, Fatai Zhang, Yuji Tochio,
  Xihua Fu, 2013-07-15, <draft-fedyk-ccamp-uni-extensions-02.txt>

      This document builds on the GMPLS overlay model [RFC4208] and defines
      extensions to the GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) to support route
      diversity within the core network for sets of LSPs initiated by edge
      nodes. A particular example where route diversity within the core
      network is desired, are dual-homed edge nodes. The document also
      defines GMPLS UNI extensions to deal with latency requirements for
      edge node initiated LSPs.
      
      This document uses a VPN model that is based on the same premise as
      L1VPN framework [RFC4847] but may also be applied to other
      technologies.  The extensions are applicable both to VPN and non VPN
      environments. These extensions move the UNI from basic connectivity
      to enhanced mode connectivity by including additional constraints
      while minimizing the exchange of CE to PE information. These
      extensions are applicable to the overlay extension service model.
      Route Diversity for customer LSPs are a common requirement applicable
      to L1VPNs. The UNI mechanisms described in this document are L1VPN
      compatible and can be applied to achieve diversity for sets of
      customer LSPs.
      
      The UNI extensions in support of latency constraints can also be
      applied to the extended overlay service model in order for the
      customer LSPs to meet certain latency requirements.

  "Common Template for HTTP Message-based Multi-hop Authentication",
  Yutaka Oiwa, Hajime Watanabe, Hiromitsu Takagi, Boku Kihara, Tatsuya
  Hayashi, Yuichi Ioku, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-oiwa-httpauth-multihop-template-00.txt,.ps,.pdf>

      This document specifies a common protocol design template for
      authentication on the Hyper-text Transport Protocol (HTTP) involving
      multi-hop message exchanges.  To facilitate advanced authentication
      technologies such as hash-based exchanges, zero-knowledge password
      proof, or public-key authentications on HTTP, a kind of state
      management and key management facilities are required on the general
      HTTP authentication message framework.  Also, to optimize performance
      of such authentication schemes, a well-designed mechanism for key
      caching and re-authentication are needed.  The template defined in
      this document provides a generic foundation for implementing such
      advanced authentication technologies.

  "ICN Management Considerations", Daniel Corujo, Kostas Pentikousis, Ivan
  Vidal, 2013-07-12, <draft-corujo-icn-mgmt-01.txt>

      This document aims to draw the attention of the ICNRG community to
      network management, an important but hitherto underdeveloped area of
      research in information-centric networking.  We consider that the
      availability of modern management mechanisms for information-centric
      networks will foster their deployment in real-world environments.
      For example, we argue that there is a need for creating basic network
      management tools early on while ICN is still in the design and
      experimentation phases that can evolve over time.  Perhaps ICN can
      borrow successful mechanisms from the host-centric paradigm and adapt
      them to the new network primitives.  Alternatively, novel network
      management schemes can be designed based on ICN primitives.  As a
      discussion starter, this document summarizes recently published
      approaches for ICN network management.  In particular, this first
      version presents a management framework for named data networking and
      reviews previous work on NetInf management.

  Tschofenig, Jouni Korhonen, Glen Zorn, Kervin Pillay, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-tschofenig-dime-e2e-sec-req-01.txt>

      This specification discusses requirements for providing Diameter
      security at the level of individual Attribute Value Pairs.

  "PIM Join Attributes for LISP Environments", Jesus Arango, Stig Venaas,
  Isidor Kouvelas, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-arango-pim-join-attributes-for-lisp-00.txt,.pdf>

      This document defines two PIM Join/Prune attributes that support the
      construction of multicast distribution trees where the root and
      receivers are located in different LISP sites.  These attributes
      allow the receiver site to select between unicast and multicast
      transport and to convey the receiver RLOC address to the control
      plane of the root xTR.

  "Vehicle Identification Number-Based IPv6 Interface Identifier (VIID)",
  Sofiane Imadali, Alexandru Petrescu, Christophe Janneteau, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-imadali-its-vinipv6-viid-00.txt>

      The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a 17 characters
      alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a vehicle worldwide.  This
      code is standardized in ISO-3779 and ISO-3780; other standardization
      bodies' implementation of this code (NHTSA, SAE) is compliant with
      ISO standards.  The VIN is mandatory for each vehicle and used as a
      unique identity.  Some public information related to a vehicle can be
      obtained knowing its VIN code.
      
      An IPv6 address is 128 bit in length and its rightmost bits form the
      Interface Identifier (IID).  When the IPv6 address is used with IPv6-
      over-Ethernet and Stateless Address Auto-Configuration, the length of
      the IID is 64 bit.
      
      This document presents an experimental method to convert an IPv6
      Interface Identifier starting from the VIN code - the VIID.  The
      conversion can be reverted - given a VIID formed from a VIN it easily
      possible to find out the original VIN.

  "A Keying Database for Diameter End-to-End Security", Hannes Tschofenig,
  2013-02-18, <draft-tschofenig-dime-keying-database-00.txt>

      The Diameter Base specification offers security protection between
      neighboring Diameter peers using TLS, DTLS, and IPsec.  The
      development of a solution to protect Diameter Attribute Value Pairs
      between non-neighboring nodes is currently work in progress.
      
      Diameter nodes maintain different types of databases, depending on
      their functions.  Examples include the peer table and the realm-based
      routing table.  This document describes a conceptual model for a
      keying database as it would be used by a Diameter node to determine
      what AVPs to protect, and what keys / algorithms to use.  On the
      receiving side it allows the receiving node to select the appropriate
      security association for verifying the protected AVPs.  The design is
      similar to IPsec and inspired by the routing protocol security key
      table.

  "Vehicle Identification Number-Based Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses
  (VULA)", Sofiane Imadali, Alexandru Petrescu, Christophe Janneteau,
  2013-02-18, <draft-imadali-its-vinipv6-vula-00.txt>

      The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is standardized in ISO-3779
      and ISO-3780.  The VIN is made of 17 alphanumeric characters code
      that uniquely identifies a vehicle worldwide.  Some public
      information related to a vehicle can be obtained knowing its VIN
      code.  This code may also be used to enable novel vehicular
      networking communications.
      
      RFC 4193 introduces a globally unique IPv6 unicast address format
      intended for local communications, usually inside of a site.  These
      addresses (ULA) are not expected to be routable on the global
      Internet.  This document introduces a method to build a VIN-based
      IPv6 Prefix that is intended for local communications involving more
      than one hop (VULA).  The VIN-based generated prefix is assured to be
      unique among other VIN-based generated prefixes.  Typically, in a
      scenario involving several vehicles, each single vehicle (in which
      one Mobile Router is in charge) is capable of generating its own
      unique infrastructure-independent globally-scoped VIN-based IPv6
      prefix.  This document also describes some use cases where VULA could
      be exploited.

  "YANG modifications for I2RS", Rex Fernando, pals, Muthumayan Madhayyan,
  Alex Clemm, 2013-02-18, <draft-rfernando-i2rs-yang-mods-00.txt>

      Interface to Routing Systems (I2RS) provides the mechanisms for the
      programmatic access of routing system components. YANG [RFC 6020] is
      a modeling language that is used to specify an external visible data
      model of sub-system - for defining both configuration and operational
      data held in the networking device. NETCONF is the protocol that is
      used to perform these configurations and accessing the operational
      data.
      
      This document proposes to use the YANG data modeling language for
      I2RS data models. It also proposes a set of YANG language changes to
      enable the I2RS data models for multi-client and programmatic access.
      
      This document also proposes the scope for the I2RS programmed data
      set on the Routing System and the necessary mechanisms for data
      synchronization.
      
      This document also recommends a binary encoding for "on-the-wire"
      transfer of the YANG data model elements instead of XML.

  "Model-Based Estimation of Streaming Performance", Ken Ko, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-ko-ippm-streaming-performance-00.txt>

      This memo defines metrics plus a methodology for post-measurement
      processing of sample metrics to evaluate network path performance
      relative to streaming video traffic. The metrics are based on
      established methodologies for TCP throughput testing. The post-
      processing methodology is based on a model of streaming traffic that
      allows a given sample metric to be evaluated against multiple sets
      of parameters representing different streaming rates, delays and
      buffering values. The results of the post-processing methodology are
      derived metrics that are suitable for statistical analysis.

  "A VP9 Bitstream Overview", Adrian Grange, Harald Alvestrand,
  2013-02-18, <draft-grange-vp9-bitstream-00.txt>

      This document describes VP9, a video codec being developed
      specifically to meet the demand for the consumption of video over the
      Internet, including professionally and amateur produced video-on-
      demand and conversational video content.  VP9 is an evolution of the
      VP8 video codec that is described in [bankoski-rfc6386] and includes
      a number of enhancements and new coding tools that have been added to
      improve the coding efficiency.  The new tools that have been added so
      far include: larger prediction block sizes up to 64x64, various forms
      of compound INTER prediction, more modes for INTRA prediction,
      &#8539;-pel motion vectors, 8-tap switchable sub-pixel interpolation
      filters, improved motion reference generation, improved motion vector
      coding, improved entropy coding including frame-level entropy
      adaptation for various symbols, improved loop filtering, the
      incorporation of the Asymmetric Discrete Sine Transform (ADST),
      larger 16x16 and 32x32 DCTs, and improved frame level segmentation.
      VP9 is under active development and this document provides only a
      snapshot of the current state of the coding tools as they exist
      today.  The finalized version of the VP9 bitstream may differ
      considerably from the description contained herein and may encompass
      the exclusion or modification of existing coding tools or the
      addition of new coding tools.

  "OAuth 2.0: Audience Information", Hannes Tschofenig, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-tschofenig-oauth-audience-00.txt>

      The OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token specification allows any party in
      possession of a bearer token to get access to the associated
      resources (without demonstrating possession of a cryptographic key).
      To prevent misuse, two important security assumptions must hold:
      bearer tokens must be protected from disclosure in storage and in
      transport and the access token must only be valid for use with a
      specific resource server (the audience) and with a specific scope.
      
      This document defines a new header that is used by the client to
      indicate what resource server, as the intended recipient, it wants to
      access.  This information is subsequently also communicated by the
      authorization server securely to the resource server, for example
      within the audience field of the access token.

  "Requirements for the IETF Liaison Statement Tool", Eliot Lear, Spencer

      This memo specifies requirements for the liaison statement tool used
      by IETF working group chairs, IESG members, and the IAB, as well as
      representatives of organizations that liaise to these IETF entities.

  "Global Table Multicast with BGP-MVPN Procedures", Jeffrey Zhang,
  Leonard Giuliano, Dante Pacella, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-zzhang-mboned-mvpn-global-table-mcast-00.txt>

      This document describes a way to implement Global Table Multicast,
      aka Internet Multicast, using BGP encodings and procedures for MVPN
      as specified in [RFC6514].
      
      No protocol modification/extension is required.  This is purely for
      informational and clarifying purposes only.

  "SCIM Profile For Enhancing Just-In-Time Provisioning", Mark Wahl,
  2013-02-18, <draft-wahl-scim-jit-profile-00.txt>

      This document specifies a profile of the System for Cross-Domain
      Identity Management Protocol (SCIM) for use by servers which rely
      upon just-in-time provisioning patterns in a protocol (such as SAML)
      to create user accounts, and need an additional channel to be
      notified of changes to user accounts.

  "Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network
  Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols", Ari
  Keranen, Jonathan Rosenberg, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-keranen-mmusic-rfc5245bis-01.txt>

      This document describes a protocol for Network Address Translator
      (NAT) traversal for UDP-based multimedia sessions established with
      the offer/answer model.  This protocol is called Interactive
      Connectivity Establishment (ICE).  ICE makes use of the Session
      Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol and its extension,
      Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN).  ICE can be used by any protocol
      utilizing the offer/answer model, such as the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP).
      
      This document obsoletes RFC 5245.

  "SDP and CLUE message interactions", Robert Hansen, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-hansen-clue-sdp-interaction-01.txt>

      This document attempts to help resolve some of the complexities of
      interaction between SDP and CLUE messages in call flows by providing
      some strategies and some suggested syntax.

  "Problem Statement and Architecture for Information Exchange Between
  Interconnected Traffic Engineered Networks", Adrian Farrel, John Drake,
  Nabil Bitar, George Swallow, Daniele Ceccarelli, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-farrel-interconnected-te-info-exchange-01.txt>

      In Traffic Engineered (TE) systems, it is sometimes desirable to
      establish an end-to-end TE path with a set of constraints (such as
      bandwidth) across one or more network from a source to a destination.
      TE information is the data relating to nodes and TE links that is
      used in the process of selecting a TE path.  The availability of TE
      information is usually limited to within a network (such as an IGP
      area) often referred to as a domain.
      
      In order to determine the potential to establish a TE path through a
      series of connected networks, it is necessary to have available a
      certain amount of TE information about each network.  This need not
      be the full set of TE information available within each network, but
      does need to express the potential of providing TE connectivity. This
      subset of TE information is called TE reachability information.
      
      This document sets out the problem statement and architecture for the
      exchange of TE information between interconnected TE networks in
      support of end-to-end TE path establishment.  For reasons that are
      explained in the document, this work is limited to simple TE
      constraints and information that determine TE reachability.

  "Diameter Overload Data Analysis", Ben Campbell, Hannes Tschofenig,
  Jouni Korhonen, Adam Roach, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-campbell-dime-overload-data-analysis-00.txt>

      When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be
      able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to
      reduce sending traffic for some period of time.  Multiple mechanisms
      have been proposed for transporting overload and load information.
      While these proposals differ in many ways, they share similar data
      requirements.  This document analyzes the data requirements of each
      proposal with a view towards proposing a common set of of Diameter
      Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs).

  "Security Bootstrapping Solution for Resource-Constrained Devices",
  Behcet Sarikaya, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-sarikaya-core-secure-bootsolution-00.txt>

      We present a solution to initially configure the network of resource
      constrained nodes securely, a.k.a., security bootstrapping.  The
      solution is based on EAP-TLS authentication with the use of raw
      public keys as certificates.

  Sri Gundavelli, Mark Grayson, Rajat Ghai, 2013-03-13,
  <draft-pularikkal-opsawg-lawful-intercept-spwifi-01.txt>

      Lawful Intercept stands for legally authorized capture & delivery of
      subscriber communications data by a communications provider to a law
      enforcement agency.This document describes Generic Lawful Intercept
      Architecture Models & implementation considerations for Service
      Provider Wi-Fi deployments.

  "Example IPR License Terms", Timothy Terriberry, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-terriberry-ipr-license-00.txt>

      This draft gives provides an example set of licensing terms for use
      in IPR disclosures that are compatible with the goals of the proposed
      video-codec working group for further discussion and refinement by
      participants at the IETF.  Although usage of such a license is
      strictly voluntary, the hope is that getting agreement on a set of
      terms before the bulk of the work begins will allow contributors to
      use a common license and minimize the amount of legal analysis that
      must be performed in order to deploy the codec.

  "A framework for large-scale measurements", Philip Eardley, Trevor
  Burbridge, Al Morton, 2013-07-15, <draft-eardley-lmap-framework-02.txt>

      Measuring broadband service on a large scale requires standardisation
      of the logical architecture and a description of the key protocols
      that coordinate interactions between the components.  The document
      presents an overall framework for large-scale measurements and
      discusses which elements could be standardised in the IETF.  It is
      intended to assist the discussions about the potential creation of
      the LMAP working group.

  "Well Known Service and URI Declarations", Phillip Hallam-Baker,
  2013-02-18, <draft-hallambaker-wellknown-00.txt>

      Under the current system of registration, separate requests are
      required to register entries for .well-known HTTP services, discovery
      via DNS mechanisms such as SRV and NAPTR and for a URI prefix.  This
      proposal encourages Web Services to adopt a consistent approach to
      configuration through a 'one stop' registration system whereby
      assignment of a .well-known identifier automatically assigns DNS and
      URI prefixes.

  "Entropy label for seamless MPLS", Ravi Singh, Yimin Shen, John Drake,
  2013-02-18, <draft-ravisingh-mpls-el-for-seamless-mpls-00.txt>

      This document describes how entropy labels can be used for load
      balancing in a seamless MPLS architecture. The definition of the
      control plane and data plane behavior at LSP stitching points; and at
      the ingress of an LSP in a hierarchy of LSPs, as described in this
      document, brings the benefits of entropy labels to seamless MPLS as
      MPLS deployments proliferate in the access and aggregation networks.
      
      This document updates RFC 6790.

  "IPv6 Prefix Properties", Jouni Korhonen, Basavaraj Patil, Sri
  Gundavelli, Pierrick Seite, Dapeng Liu, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-korhonen-6man-prefix-properties-02.txt>

      This specification defines an extension to the IPv6 Neighbor
      Discovery protocol and the stateless address autoconfiguration
      procedure.  A new Prefix Information Option with meta data is defined
      that describe the properties and other prefix class meta data
      associated with the prefix.  The stateless address autoconfiguration
      procedure and end hosts can make use of the additional properties and
      class information when selecting prefixes for a particular uses and
      use cases.  This specification updates RFC4861 and also updates
      RFC4862.

  "3GPP IMS Option for IKEv2", Aeneas Noble, Sri Gundavelli, Jouni
  Korhonen, Florin Baboescu, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-gundavelli-ipsecme-3gpp-ims-options-00.txt>

      This document defines two new configuration attributes for Internet
      Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2).  These attributes can be
      used for carrying the IPv4 and IPv6 address of the Proxy-Call Control
      and Service function (P-CSCF).  This is one of the few methods that
      an IPsec client can obtain the IP address of the P-CSCF function
      located in the home network.

  "IPv6 Multihoming with Source Address Dependent Routing (SADR)", Ole
  Troan, Lorenzo Colitti, 2013-02-18, <draft-troan-homenet-sadr-00.txt>

      A multihomed network using provider aggregatable addresses must send
      the packet out the right path to avoid violating the provider's
      ingress filtering.  This memo suggests a mechanism called Source
      Address Dependent Routing to solve that problem.

  "Automating DNSSEC delegation trust maintenance", Warren Kumari, Olafur
  Gudmundsson, George Barwood, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-kumari-ogud-dnsop-cds-03.txt>

      This document describes a method to allow DNS operators to more
      easily update DNSSEC Key Signing Keys using DNS as communication
      channel.  This document does not address the initial configuration of
      trust anchors for a domain.  The technique described is aimed at
      delegations in which it is currently hard to move information from
      the child to parent.

  "Virtual Machine Mobility Protocol Using Distributed Proxy Mobile IPv6",
  Behcet Sarikaya, Linda Dunbar, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-sarikaya-nvo3-vmm-dmm-pmip-01.txt>

      This document specifies a new IP level protocol for seamless virtual
      machine mobility in data centers.  Source Hypervisor registers the
      newly created virtual machine with the centrally available management
      node.  When the virtual machine moves to the destination Hypervisor,
      the destination Hypervisor updates the virtual machine record in the
      management node.  Management node sends registration message to all
      previous source Hypervisors in order to direct the ongoing traffic to
      the destination Hypervisor.  Cold and hot virtual machine mobility
      are achieved using dynamic domain name system update and host routes.
      Both intra data center and inter data center hot virtual machine
      mobility solutions are presented.

  "TRILL Over Pseudo Wires", Lucy Yong, Donald Eastlake, Sam Aldrin, Jon
  Hudson, 2013-02-18, <draft-yong-pwe3-trill-o-pw-00.txt>

      This document describes ways to interconnect a pair of TRILL
      (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) switch ports with two
      types of pseudo wires under existing TRILL and PWE3 (pseudowire
      Emulation End-to-End) standards.

  "Use Cases for Virtual Connections on Demand (VCoD) and Virtual Network
  on Demand using Interface to Routing System", Susan Hares, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-hares-i2rs-use-case-vn-vc-00.txt,.pdf>

      Software Defined Networks (SDN) provide a way to virtualize and
      abstract the network and present the virtual or abstract resources to
      the third-party applications running in software.  The application
      can utilize a programmable interface to receiving these virtual or
      abstract resources in a form that allows monitoring or manipulation
      of resources.  Various programmatic interfaces have been proposed to
      interface directly to the forwarding plane (OpenFlow, ForCES), or do
      device configuration (NETCONF).  ALTO has proposed a informational
      interface to the application.  Only the progammatic Interface to the
      Routing System (IRS) provides an interface directly to the routing
      system to utilize all aspects of the routing system as a system.
      
      The IRS system interacts with the control plane processes to monitor
      best paths to any destination and to change the routing information
      base (RIB) or MPLS label information Base (LIB) which feeds the
      forwarding tables the information needed to actually switch traffic
      at a local level.
      
      This document outlines how SDN networks can use the IRS interface to
      implement an automated set of network services for Virtual Connection
      on Demand (VCoD) and Virtual Network on Demand (VNoD)

  "Coordinated Forwarding and Caching in Information-Centric Networks",
  Haiyong Xie, Yi Sun, Yunfei Zhang, Haibin Zhai, Hanwen Zhang,
  2013-02-18, <draft-xie-icnrg-coordinated-caching-forwarding-00.txt>

      Content caching plays an important role in Information-Centric
      Networking (ICN).  Many of current ICN designs adopt a limited, en-
      route hierarchical caching mechanism; additionally, caching and
      forwarding are largely uncoordinated in these designs.  This draft
      describes a coordinated caching and forwarding design to improve
      content access cost and cache miss rate of ICN.

  "Use Cases for an Interface to the Routing System", Russ White, Susan
  Hares, Rex Fernando, 2013-02-18, <draft-white-i2rs-use-case-00.txt,.pdf>

      Programmatic interfaces to provide control over individual forwarding
      devices in a network promise to reduce operational costs while
      improving scaling, control, and visibility into the operation of
      large scale networks.  To this end, several programmatic interfaces
      have been proposed.  OpenFlow, for instance, provides a mechanism to
      replace the dynamic control plane processes on individual forwarding
      devices throughout a network with off box processes that interact
      with the forwarding tables on each device.  Another example is
      NETCONF, which provides a fast and flexible mechanism to interact
      with device configuration and policy.
      
      There is, however, no proposal which provides an interface to all
      aspects of the routing systemas a system.  Such a system would not
      interact with the forwarding system on individual devices, but rather
      with the control plane processes already used to discover the best
      path to any given destination through the network, as well as
      interact with the routing information base (RIB), which feeds the
      forwarding table the information needed to actually switch traffic at
      a local level.
      
      This document describes a set of use cases such a system could
      fulfill.  It is designed to provide underlying support for the
      framework, policy, and other drafts describing the Interface to the
      Routing System (IRS).

  "NVO3 Requirements Versus Available Protocol Capabilities", Xiaoming
  Chen, Tina Tsou, Evelyne Roch, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-chen-nvo3-gap-analysis-00.txt>

      This document matches candidate protocols against the NVO3
      requirements.  Based on the results, gaps are identified and further
      protocol work is recommended.

  "Two Dimensional-IP Routing Protocol in Home Networks", Mingwei Xu, Shu
  Yang, Jianping Wu, Dan Wang, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-xu-homenet-twod-ip-routing-00.txt>

      Home netowrk design faces many challenges currently.  Two of them are
      multi-homing and policy enforcement.  Different with other types of
      networks, home network operators are usually not professional
      technicians or geeks.  The problems we face are fundamentally related
      with the poor semantics provided by current destination-based routing
      protocol.
      
      TwoD-IP routing protocol is a link state routing protocol that makes
      routing decisions based on both destination and source addresses.
      This document describes the mechanism for supporting flexible multi-
      homing and policy routing across home networks.

  "Automated prefix allocation in IS-IS", Fred Baker, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-baker-ipv6-isis-automatic-prefix-00.txt>

      This note describes a TLV and associated mechanisms for the
      allocation of /64 prefixes from a less specific prefix.

  "Alternatives to BUNDLE", Richard Ejzak, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ejzak-mmusic-bundle-alternatives-01.txt>

      This paper discusses some potential modifications to the BUNDLE
      proposal for multiplexing of multiple media types within a single
      5-tuple to address limitations of the current proposal and
      alternatives already considered by MMUSIC.

  "Using Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) with Session
  Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer and Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP)", Marc Petit-Huguenin, Ari Keranen, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-petithuguenin-mmusic-ice-sip-sdp-01.txt>

      This document describes how Interactive Connectivity Establishment
      (ICE) is used with Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer
      and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

  "Extended Encoding Scheme for Shared List Link Group (SRLG)", Zafar Ali,
  George Swallow, Clarence Filsfils, Ori Gerstel, Stewart Bryant, Matt
  Hartley, 2013-02-18, <draft-ali-ccamp-extended-srlg-00.txt>

      SRLGs play a key role in routing resiliency and capacity planning of
      multi-domain and multi-layer networks. Notion of SRLG are used to select
      a
      backup path that is disjoint from the primary path, to ensure
      disjointness
      of circuits and to avoid catastrophic partitioning outages.
      
      In the current specifications, SRLG is identified as a 32 bit number
      that
      is unique within an IGP domain [RFC4202]. There are many
      limitations to
      this approach of encoding SRLGs, especially in a multi-
      layer network. This
      draft outlines these limitations and suggests
      components of extended SRLG
      encoding scheme to address them.

  "A Framework for SDP Attributes when Multiplexing", Suhas Nandakumar,
  2013-07-15, <draft-nandakumar-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes-03.txt,.pdf>

      The Session Description Protocol (SDP) provides mechanisms to
      describe attributes of multimedia sessions and of individual media
      streams (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within a
      multimedia session.  In the RTCWeb WG, there is a need to use a
      single 5-tuple for sending and receiving media associated with
      multiple media descriptions ("m=" lines).  Such a requirement has
      raised concerns over the semantic implications of the SDP attributes
      associated with the RTP Sessions multiplexed over a single transport
      layer flow.
      
      The scope of this specification is to provide a framework for
      analyzing the multiplexing characteristics of SDP attributes.  The
      specification also categorizes existing attributes based on the
      framework described herein.

  "Hash-Based Signatures", David McGrew, Michael Curcio, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-mcgrew-hash-sigs-01.txt>

      This note describes a digital signature system based on cryptographic
      hash functions, following the seminal work in this area.  It
      specifies a one-time signature scheme based on the work of Lamport,
      Diffie, Winternitz, and Merkle (LDWM), and specifies a general
      signature system using a Merkle tree.  These systems provide
      asymmetric authentication without using large integer mathematics and
      achieve a high security level.  They are suitable for compact
      implementations, are relatively simple to implement, and naturally
      resist side-channel attacks.  Unlike most other signature systems,
      hash-based signatures would still be secure even if it proves
      feasible for an attacker to build a quantum computer.

  "Container Resolution System in ICN", Rong Wang, Chunfeng Yao, Zhefeng
  Yan, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-wang-icnrg-container-resolution-system-00.txt,.pdf>

      We illustrate the architecture and mechanism of container resolution
      system, and to the protocol of resolving containers in ICN. The
      fundamental characters are:1)Use Interest and Data packet as the
      communication primitives, 2)Every routing node has FIB, CS, PIT
      tables to do packet routing and caching. Current NDN/CCN architecture
      does not require a resolution system. The routing is totally based on
      prefixes of content names, which causes scalability and mobility
      issues described in [Cisco-Name]. This draft addresses the
      aforementioned issues.

  "Container Assisted Naming and Routing for ICN", Chunfeng Yao, Rong
  Wang, Yuanzhe Xuan, Zhefeng Yan, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-yao-icnrg-naming-routing-00.txt,.pdf>

      In ICN (Information-centric network), everything is an identifiable
      object with a name, therefore the number of name prefixes is a few
      orders of magnitude higher than that in current BGP routing table.
      Towards scalable routing in ICN, we propose a name scheme, called
      container assisted  naming. With this scheme, an object name consists
      of two components: a content name which uniquely specifies the object
      within certain scope, and one or more containers which define access
      relationships to the object. This document illustrates the concept of
      container and how it assists scalable routing in ICN.

  "Extensions to OSPF facilitating the deployment of non-backward-
  compatible changes.", Mike Dubrovsky, Rashmi Shrivastava, Dean Cheng,
  2013-02-18, <draft-dubrovsky-ospf-non-compatible-00.txt>

      This document specifies a generic mechanism that facilitates the
      deployment of non-backward-compatible changes in OSPF protocol.  This
      mechanism allows the OSPF routers to advertise the capability of non-
      backward-compatible functionality and to make the functionality
      operational only when supported by all participating routers.
      Depending on the functionality scope, capability advertisements must
      be propagated across a link, area or autonomous system (AS).  For
      link and area scope functionality, Router Information Link State
      Advertisement (LSA) is utilized to propagate the capability
      information.  For the cases when compatibility must be maintained
      across the whole OSPF autonomous system, new Area Information (AI)
      LSA is introduced.  The AI LSA is a TLV-based analog of Indication-
      LSA that is used for demand circuit functionality and described in
      RFC1793.

  "IS-IS Topology-Transparent Zone", Huaimo Chen, Renwei Li, Gregory
  Cauchie, So Ning, Alvaro Retana, 2013-05-03,
  <draft-chen-isis-ttz-01.txt>

      This document presents a topology-transparent zone in a domain.  A
      topology-transparent zone comprises a group of routers and a number
      of circuits connecting these routers.  Any router outside of the zone
      is not aware of the zone.  The information about the circuits and
      routers inside the zone is not distributed to any router outside of
      the zone.  Any link state change such as a circuit down inside the
      zone is not seen by any router outside of the zone.

  "VXLAN DCI Using EVPN", Sami Boutros, Ali Sajassi, Samer Salam, Dennis
  Cai, Samir Thoria, John Drake, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-boutros-l2vpn-vxlan-evpn-02.txt>

      This document describes how Ethernet VPN (EVPN) technology can be
      used to interconnect VXLAN or NVGRE networks over an MPLS/IP network.
      This is to provide intra-subnet connectivity at Layer 2 and control-
      plane separation among the interconnected VXLAN or NVGRE networks.
      The scope of the learning of host MAC addresses in VXLAN or NVGRE
      network is limited to data plane learning in this document.

  "Conditional Enablement of Configuration Nodes", Kent Watsen,
  2013-02-18, <draft-kwatsen-conditional-enablement-00.txt>

      This memo presents a cross-cutting technique whereby a NETCONF server
      can support conditional enablement of configuration nodes.  That is,
      whether the node is active or not depends on the evaluation of an
      expression.  Two expression types are defined herein, one for latent
      configuration (present but not actualized) and another for temporal
      configuration (actualized based on time).  This soluton presented is
      extensible so that additional expression types may be added in the
      future.

  "A Taxonomy of Grouping Semantics and Mechanisms for Real-Time Transport
  Protocol (RTP) Sources", Jonathan Lennox, Kevin Gross, Suhas Nandakumar,
  Gonzalo Salgueiro, BoB, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-lennox-raiarea-rtp-grouping-taxonomy-01.txt>

      The terminology about, and associations among, Real-Time Transport
      Protocol (RTP) sources can be complex and somewhat opaque.  This
      document describes a number of existing and proposed relationships
      among RTP sources, and attempts to define common terminology for
      discussing protocol entities and their relationships.
      
      This document is still very rough, but is submitted in the hopes of
      making future discussion productive.

  "Supporting Source-Multiplexing of the Real-Time Transport Protocol
  (RTP) Payload for Generic Forward Error Correction", Jonathan Lennox,
  2013-02-18, <draft-lennox-payload-ulp-ssrc-mux-00.txt>

      The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Payload format for Generic
      Forward Error Correction (FEC), specified in RFC 5109, forbids
      transmitting FEC repair flows as separate sources in the same RTP
      session as the flows being repaired.  This document updates RFC 5109
      to lift that restriction, as long as the association between original
      and repair flows is properly signaled and negotiated.

  "Managing SSH Keys for Automated Access - Current Recommended Practice",
  Tatu Ylonen, Greg Kent, 2013-04-03, <draft-ylonen-sshkeybcp-01.txt>

      This document presents current recommended practice for managing SSH
      user keys for automated access.  It provides guidelines for
      discovering, remediating, and continuously managing SSH user keys and
      other authentication credentials.
      
      Various threats from poorly managed SSH keys are identified,
      including virus spread, unaudited backdoors, illegitimate access
      using leaked keys, lack of proper termination of access, use of
      legitimate access for unintended purposes, and accidental human
      errors.
      
      Hundreds of thousands, even over a million SSH keys authorizing
      access have been found from the IT environments of many large
      organizations.  This is many times more than they have interactive
      users.  These access-granting credentials have largely been ignored
      in identity and access management, and present a real risk to
      information security.
      
      A process is presented for discovering who has access to what,
      bringing an existing IT environment under control with respect to
      automated access and SSH keys.  The process includes moving
      authorized keys to protected locations, removing unused keys,
      associating authorized keys with a business process or application
      and removing keys for which no valid purpose can be found, rotating
      existing keys, restricting what can be done with each authorized key,
      and establishing an approval process for new authorized keys.  A
      process is also presented for continuous monitoring and controlled
      authorized key setup.
      
      Finally, recommendations are made for security policy makers for
      ensuring that automated access and SSH keys are properly addressed in
      an organization's security policy.
      
      Specific requirements are presented that address the security issues
      while keeping costs reasonable.
      
      Guidance is also provided on how to reduce operational cost while
      addressing the threats and how to use tools to automate the
      management process.

  "Scalable Hybrid Routing for Information-Centric Networks", Haiyong Xie,
  Yi Sun, Guoqiang Wang, Haibo Wu, Jun Li, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-xie-icnrg-hybrid-routing-00.txt>

      Name-based routing in information-centric networks faces many
      challenges, one of which is the scalability challenge; in particular,
      content routers may not have sufficiently large FIB to store a large
      portion of name prefixes, even if the latter are aggressively
      aggregated.  In many ICN designs routers have to rely on inefficient
      mechanisms (e.g., Interest broadcast in content-centric networks) in
      order to route requests.  In this draft, we describe a hybrid,
      reactive routing approach, where we augment the information-centric
      network design with an Infrastructure Information Base (IIB) to reap
      the benefits of both name-based and infrastructure-based routing.
      Simulation-based evaluations demonstrate that this scheme can
      significantly improve the network scalability by cutting down the
      number of broadcast packets while maintaining the same level of the
      user-perceived latency.

  "Modern cryptography TKEY", Francis Dupont, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-dupont-dnsext-ec-tkey-00.txt>

      This document updates the TKEY resource record specifications for the
      use of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, and related IANA registries.

  "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) usage for Trickle ICE", Emil Ivov,
  Adam Roach, 2013-02-18, <draft-ivov-dispatch-sdpfrag-00.txt>

      This document registers the application/sdpfrag Multipurpose Internet
      Mail Extensions (MIME) media type.  This type is similar to
      application/sdp, but allows certain subsets of well formed session
      descriptions, as per the Session Description Protocol (SDP), to be
      represented instead of requiring a complete SDP session description.
      The "a=candidate" lines that are incrementally exchanged between
      Trickle ICE agents are one example usage of the application/sdpfrag.

  "Experience of Designing Network Management System", Yasuhiro TERAMOTO,
  Ray Aatarashi, Yoshifumi Atarashi, Yasuo Okabe, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-teramoto-experience-network-management-01.txt>

      This document describes our experiences from designing and
      implementing a large-scale local area network management system using
      mainly NETCONF.  We designed the data models for device
      configurations and implemented NETCONF client to centrally control
      multiple devices of various vendors.  The document provides insight
      on strong and weak points of current NETCONF approach.  The document
      also makes some recommendations about NETCONF and future network
      management protocols.

  "IP Inter-Subnet Forwarding in EVPN", Ali Sajassi, Samer Salam, Yakov
  Rekhter, John Drake, Lucy Yong, Linda Dunbar, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-inter-subnet-forwarding-02.txt>

      EVPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution
      for intra-subnet connectivity among hosts/VMs over an MPLS/IP
      network. However, there are scenarios in which inter-subnet
      forwarding among hosts/VMs across different IP subnets is required,
      while maintaining the multi-homing capabilities of EVPN. This
      document describes an IRB solution based on EVPN to address such
      requirements.

  "BGP IP VPN Virtual PE", Luyuan Fang, David Ward, Rex Fernando, Maria
  Napierala, Nabil Bitar, Dhananjaya Rao, Bruno Rijsman, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-fang-l3vpn-virtual-pe-03.txt>

      This document describes the architecture solutions for BGP/MPLS IP
      Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) with virtual Provider Edge (vPE)
      routers. It provides a functional description of the vPE control
      plane, the data plane, and the provisioning management process. The
      vPE solutions supports both Software Defined Networking (SDN)
      approach by allowing physical decoupling of the control and the
      forwarding plane of a vPE, as well as a distributed routing approach.
      These solutions allow vPE to be co-resident with the application
      virtual machines (VMs) on a single end device, such as a server, as
      well as on a Top-of-Rack switch (ToR), or in any network or compute
      device. The ability to provide end-to-end native BGP IP VPN
      connections between a Data Center (DC) (and/or other types of service
      network) applications and the Enterprise IP VPN sites is highly
      desirable to both Service Providers and Enterprises.

  "Kerberos Ticket flag indicating KDC support for resolving hostname
  aliases", Tom Yu, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-yu-kitten-kerberos-kdc-does-aliases-00.txt>

      This document specifies a Kerberos Ticket flag that indicates that
      the Key Distribution Center (KDC) can resolve hostname aliases in
      service principal names.  This document updates RFC 4120.

  "Proposed Plan for Usage of SDP and RTP", Cullen Jennings, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-jennings-rtcweb-plan-01.txt>

      This draft outlines a bunch of the remaining issues in RTCWeb related
      to how the the W3C APIs map to various usages of RTP and the
      associated SDP.  It proposes one possible solution to that problem
      and outlines several chunks of work that would need to be put into
      other drafts or result in new drafts being written.  The underlying
      design guideline is to, as much as possible, re-use what is already
      defined in existing SDP [RFC4566] and RTP [RFC3550] specifications.
      
      This draft is not intended to become an specification but is meant
      for working group discussion to help build the specifications.  It is
      being discussed on the rtcweb@ietf.org mailing list though it has
      topics relating to the CLUE WG, MMUSIC WG, AVT* WG, and WebRTC WG at
      W3C.

  "Distributed Mobility Management Framework", Anthony Chan, Pierrick
  Seite, Kostas Pentikousis, Ashutosh Dutta, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-chan-dmm-framework-02.txt,.pdf>

      This document introduces a framework for mobility management
      protocols in terms of their key, abstract logical functions.  We
      explain how the framework is capable of presenting a unified view,
      reducing the clutter that prevents a casual reader from understanding
      the commonalities between different approaches in mobility
      management.  A first order application of this framework is to enable
      us to examine previously standardized mobility management protocols,
      such as MIPv6 and PMIPv6 (as well as several of their extensions),
      and describe their core functionality in terms of different
      configurations of the logical functions defined by the framework.

  "BGP IP VPN Virtual CE", Luyuan Fang, John Evans, David Ward, Rex
  Fernando, John Mullooly, So Ning, Nabil Bitar, Maria Napierala,
  2013-02-25, <draft-fang-l3vpn-virtual-ce-01.txt>

      This document describes the architecture and solutions of using
      virtual Customer Edge (vCE) of BGP IP VPN. The solution is aimed at
      providing efficient service delivery capability through CE
      virtualization, and is especially beneficial in virtual Private Cloud
      (vPC) environments for extending IP VPN into tenant virtual Data
      Center containers. This document includes: BGP IP VPN virtual CE
      architecture; Control plane and forwarding options; Data Center
      orchestration processes; integration with existing WAN enterprise
      VPNs; management capability requirements; and security
      considerations. The solution is generally applicable to any BGP IP
      VPN deployment. The virtual CE solution is complementary to the
      virtual PE solutions.
      
      Today's data center's require multi-tenancy and mechanisms to
      establish overlay network connectivity. This document describes one
      approach to enabling data center network connectivity.

  "On the Use of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Feedback for Unicast
  Multimedia Congestion Control", Colin Perkins, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-perkins-rmcat-rtp-cc-feedback-00.txt>

      This memo discusses the types of congestion control feedback that it
      is possible to send using the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and their
      suitability of use in implementing congestion control for unicast
      multimedia applications.

  "RTCWeb data channel management", Jerome Marcon, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-marcon-rtcweb-data-channel-management-00.txt>

      The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group is
      charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich
      communication using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-
      browsers.  For the support of data communication, the RTCWeb working
      group has in particular defined the concept of bi-directional data
      channels over SCTP.  How to transport application messages on these
      data channels seems straightforward (i.e. they can be carried as SCTP
      user messages), however it is yet to be decided how to establish and
      manage these data channels.  This document specifies a method for
      this, which relies first on a lightweight and scalable out-of-band
      negotiation of data channel configurations (within the SDP offer/
      answer exchange) and second on the signaling of the configuration in
      use in the SCTP user message itself.  Once these configurations are
      negotiated, further creations of data channels can occur purely in-
      band by simply sending user messages, which avoids to define a new
      in-band data channel protocol.

  "A Network Virtualization Overlay Solution using E-VPN", Ali Sajassi,
  John Drake, Nabil Bitar, Aldrin Isaac, Jim Uttaro, Wim Henderickx,
  2013-02-25, <draft-sd-l2vpn-evpn-overlay-01.txt>

      This document describes how E-VPN can be used as an NVO solution and
      explores the various tunnel encapsulation options over IP  and their
      impact on the E-VPN control-plane and procedures. In particular, the
      following encapsulation options are analyzed: MPLS over GRE, VXLAN,
      and NVGRE.

  "Glareless addition of media to existing RTCWeb Sessions", Suhas
  Nandakumar, Cullen Jennings, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-nandakumar-rtcweb-glare-handling-00.txt,.pdf>

      The RFC3264 Offer/Answer model specifies rule for the bilateral
      exchange of Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] messages for
      setting up, updating and tearing down of multimedia streams.  Rarely,
      there might be situations wherein either of the communicating
      parties, might end up being the offerer for updating an on-going
      session.  This scenario is commonly known as "glare" condition and it
      needs to be handled nevertheless.  This specification describes
      procedures for parties involved in an ongoing RTCWeb session to add
      new media in a glareless fashion.
      
      There are various ways this problem might be solved - this draft
      sketches out one possible solution to the problem.

  "BGP IP VPN Data Center Interconnect", Luyuan Fang, Rex Fernando,
  Dhananjaya Rao, Dhananjaya Rao, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-fang-l3vpn-data-center-interconnect-01.txt>

      This document discusses solutions for inter-connection of BGP MPLS
      IP/VPN [RFC4364] and Data Center (DC) overlay networks. Two
      categories of inter-connections are discussed in this document. In
      the first category, Data Center overlay virtual network is built with
      BGP IP VPN technologies, the inter-connection of IP VPN in the Data
      Center to BGP IP VPN in the WAN enables end-to-end IP VPN
      connectivity. New Inter-AS solutions are required in certain
      scenarios, in addition to the existing Inter-AS Options (A, B, C)
      defined in [RFC4364]. In the second category, Data Centers overlay
      network uses non IP VPN technologies, the inter-connection of any
      overlay virtual network in the Data Center to BGP IP VPN in the WAN
      provides end user connectivity through stitching of different overlay
      technologies, the mapping of non IP VPN overlay to IP VPN need to be
      performed at the border Gateway of the two networks. The role of
      Software Defined Network (SDN) to assist the inter-connections is
      discussed.

  "Virtual Topologies for Service Chaining in BGP IP VPNs", Rex Fernando,
  Dhananjaya Rao, Luyuan Fang, Maria Napierala, So Ning, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-rfernando-l3vpn-service-chaining-02.txt>

      This document presents techniques built upon BGP MPLS/VPN control
      plane
      mechanisms to construct virtual topologies for service chaining.
      These
      virtual service topologies interconnect network zones and constrain
      the
      flow of traffic between these zones via a sequence of service nodes so
      that interesting service functions can be applied to such trafic.
      
      This document also describes both routing control plane and network
      orchestration driven approaches to realize these virtual service
      topologies.

  "Network Performance Isolation using Congestion Policing", Bob Briscoe,
  2013-02-18, <draft-briscoe-conex-policing-00.txt>

      This document describes why policing using congestion information can
      isolate users from network performance degradation due to each
      other's usage, but without losing the multiplexing benefits of a LAN-
      style network where anyone can use any amount of any resource.
      Extensive numerical examples and diagrams are given.  The document is
      agnostic to how the congestion information reaches the policer.  The
      congestion exposure (ConEX) protocol is recommended, but other tunnel
      feedback mechanisms have been proposed.

  "CAPWAP Extension for 802.11n and Power/channel Reconfiguration", Yifan
  Chen, Dapeng Liu, Hui Deng, Lei Zhu, 2013-02-18,
  <draft-chen-opsawg-capwap-extension-00.txt>

      CAPWAP binding for 802.11 is specified by RFC5416 and it was based on
      IEEE 802-11.2007 standard.  After RFC5416 was published in 2009,
      there was several new amendent of 802.11 has been published. 802.11n
      is one of those amendent and it has been widely used in real
      deployment.  This document extends the CAPWAP binding for 802.11 to
      support 802.11n.

  "RSVP-TE Signaling Extension for Bandwidth availability", Hao Long, Min
  Ye, Greg Mirsky, Alessandro D'Alessandro, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-long-ccamp-rsvp-te-bandwidth-availability-01.txt>

      Packet switching network usually contains links with variable
      bandwidth, e.g., copper, radio, etc. The bandwidth of such link is
      sensitive to external environment. Availability is typically used
      for describing the link during network planning. This document
      describes an extension for RSVP-TE signaling for setting up a label
      switching path (LSP) in a Packet Switched Network (PSN) network
      which contains variable bandwidth link by introducing an optional
      availability field in RSVP-TE signaling.

  "Considerations on IPv6 Address Assignment", Qiongfang Ma, Tianle Yang,
  2013-02-18, <draft-ma-v6ops-ipv6-address-assignment-00.txt>

      This document discusses general principles and rules of IPv6 address
      assignment and gives an example to illustrate.

  "Network Management of Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET): Architecture, Use
  Cases, and Applicability", James Nguyen, Robert Cole, Ulrich Herberg,
  Jiazi Yi, Justin Dean, 2013-02-19,
  <draft-nguyen-manet-management-00.txt,.pdf>

      This document aims at providing an extended architecture, use case
      and applicability statement for management of MANETs, as a guideline
      for how to manage MANETs.  This document describes different
      management activities, such as network configuration, monitoring of
      state, monitoring of performance, fault management, and software
      upgrades.  Different aspects of a MANET management architecture are
      illustrated (e.g., distributed vs. centralized management, flat vs.
      hierarchical management, management of an entire network vs. an
      individual router, etc.) and contrasted to the NMS architecture in
      the Internet.  A desciption of typical MANET use cases relevant for
      management is followed by an overview of current standard management
      protocols that can be used in MANETs.

  "PID: A Generic Naming Schema for Information-centric Network", Xinwen
  Zhang, Ravi Ravindran, Haiyong Xie, Guoqiang Wang, 2013-02-20,
  <draft-zhang-icnrg-pid-naming-scheme-02.txt,.pdf>

      In Information-centric network (ICN), everything is an identifiable
      object with a name such as a named data chunk.  Different from host-
      centric connectivity, ICN connects named entities using name-based
      routing and forwarding.  At the same time, network entities, end
      devices, and applications have variant demands to verify the
      integrity and authenticity of these entities through names.  This
      document proposes a generic naming schema, called PID, which supports
      trust provenance, content lookup, routing, and inter-domain
      resolution for ICN.  With PID schema, a name consists of three
      components: principal(s), identifier(s), and domain(s).  In this
      draft, we only illustrate the principles and concepts of PID and the
      functional role of each component, and leave encoding approaches as
      implementation options.

  "Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol", Donald Slice, Steven
  Moore, James Ng, Russ White, Donnie, 2013-02-28,
  <draft-savage-eigrp-00.txt>

      This document describes the protocol design and architecture for
      Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). EIGRP is a routing
      protocol based on Distance Vector technology. The specific algorithm
      used is called DUAL, a Diffusing UPDATE Algorithm[4]. The algorithm and
      procedures were researched, developed, and simulated by SRI
      International.

  "Multicast UDP Usage Guidelines for Application Designers", Greg
  Shepherd, 2013-06-12, <draft-shepherd-multicast-udp-guidelines-01.txt>

      The multi-recipient nature of Multicast prevents the use of any pont-
      to-point connection-oriented transport, therefore restricts all
      Multicast data to be sent over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).  UDP
      provides a minimal message-passing transport that has no inherent
      congestion control mechanisms.  Because congestion control is
      critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and
      upper-layer protocols that choose to use Multicast UDP as an Internet
      service must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to
      establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic.  This
      document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of
      multicast applications and higher-level protocols.

  "Multi-Upstream Interfaces IGMP/MLD Proxy", Hong-Ke Zhang, Thomas
  Schmidt, 2013-07-13, <draft-zhang-pim-muiimp-01.txt>

      In this document, followed by the idea mentioned in [1] and
      subsequently  updated  in  [2],  an  IGMP/MLD  proxy  with  multiple
      upstream interfaces called MUIIMP is proposed and analyzed. The
      MUIIMP inherits the basic rule of the IGMP/MLD proxy but extends
      with multiple upstream interfaces. To avoid data redundancy, each
      upstream interface of an MUIIMP device MUST NOT send or subscribe to
      the same data simultaneously.

  "Attribute-Value Pairs For Provisioning Customer Equipment Supporting
  IPv4-Over-IPv6 Transitional Solutions", Cathy Zhou, Tom Taylor, Qiong
  Sun, 2013-07-14, <draft-zhou-dime-4over6-provisioning-01.txt>

      During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, customer equipment may have
      to support one of the various transition methods that have been or
      are currently being defined for carrying IPv4 packets over IPv6.
      Work is currently in progress to enumerate the information that needs
      to be provisioned on a customer edge router to support a list of
      transition techniques based on tunneling IPv4 in IPv6, with a view to
      defining reusable components for a reasonable transition path between
      these techniques.  To the extent that the provisioning is done
      dynamically, AAA support is needed to provide the information to the
      network server responsible for passing the information to the
      customer equipment.  This document specifies Diameter attribute-value
      pairs to be used for that purpose.

  "Interoperability between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
  Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)", Chris Christou,
  Michael Lundberg, Christopher Ross, Peter Saint-Andre, 2013-03-10,
  <draft-christou-sip-xmpp-interop-00.txt>

      This document is intended to serve as a reference point for
      developers and operators implementing the Session Initiation Protocol
      (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)
      within their networks.  This document does not define any new
      protocols but does define the different reference models for
      deployment of combined use of SIP and XMPP ("CUSAX") clients and SIP-
      XMPP interworking to ensure consistency across the community.

  "Benchmarking Neighbor Discovery Problems", William Cerveny, 2013-03-10,
  <draft-cerveny-bmwg-ipv6-nd-00.txt,.pdf>

      This document is a benchmarking instantiation of RFC 6583:
      "Operational Neighbor Discovery Problems".  It describes a general
      testing procedure and measurements that can be performed to evaluate
      how the problems described in RFC 6583 may impact the functionality
      or performance of intermediate nodes.

  "Distributed Mobility Management: Service flows distribution and handoff
  technique based on MIPv6", Liu Min, Yuwei Wang, 2013-03-10,
  <draft-liu-dmm-flows-distribution-and-handoff-00.txt>

      This document has a normative description of the service flows based
      on IPv6. It makes the upgrade of management model from the entire
      node granularity to the single service flow granularity, with the
      compatibility to the existing mobile IPv6. It shows a distributed,
      compatible with mobile IPv6 network layer mobility solution, which
      would take different mobility management strategies according to the
      Correspondent Node's position, network conditions and service
      requirements of the different service flows so as to achieve the
      service flow granularity switching and transmission path control. And
      the standard will also provide route optimization mechanism between
      the Mobile Node and the ordinary Correspondent Node that doesn't
      support mobile IPv6, playing a role in promoting the development of
      new applications and business based on mobile IPv6.

  "PSC protocol updates for non-revertive operation", Tae-sik Cheung,
  Alessandro D'Alessandro, Huub van Helvoort, 2013-03-10,
  <draft-cdh-mpls-tp-psc-non-revertive-00.txt>

      This document contains the updates to [RFC6378], "MPLS Transport
      Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection" to change non-revertive
      operation to be aligned with the behavior defined in [RFC4427] and in
      an effort to satisfy the ITU-T's protection switching requirements.
      An operator command, Manual Switch to Working (MS-W) is also included
      to revert traffic to the working path in non-revertive operation.

  "E164/214 MPBGP announcement", Shu Ge, 2013-03-10,
  <draft-ge-mpbgp-e164e214-00.txt>

      Recently, transferring the signaling of mobile network over IP
      attracts lots of attention from people.  Telephone number based on
      E.164 or E.214 or SP is the traditional routing address for mobile
      network, but actually, E.164, E.214 and SP is not supported by MP-BGP
      protocol.
      
      This document presents a new way to support for routing the phone
      number based on E.164, E.214 or SP though MP-BGP, by extending the
      MP-BGP for the Phone Number Routing.  It can bring optimizing for the
      network architecture and improving efficiency.

  "Autonomous Extensible Internet with Network Address Translation(AEIP
  NAT)", Diao Yongping, Ming Liao, Yuping Diao, 2013-03-11,
  <draft-diao-aeip-nat-00.txt>

      The two key issues of today's Internet are autonomy and
      extensibility. Autonomous Internet(AIP) technology can provide
      extensible internet architecture, own independent root DNS servers
      and self management internet network; Furthermore, based on the
      Autonomous Internet, here provides a way with extensible address
      capacity to solve IP address deficiency and realize
      Autonomous Extensible Internet(AEIP). It mainly adopts local
      network address based on per Autonomous IP network and uses
      bilateral dynamic NAT with global network address between
      Autonomous IP networks to solve IP address deficient problem.
      This AEIP with Network Address Translation(AEIP NAT) can realize
      autonomy and extensibility with minimal cost.

  "Delay Tolerant Networking Email Convergence Layer Protocol", Bjoern
  Gernert, Sebastian Schildt, 2013-04-23,
  <draft-gernert-dtnrg-mailcl-01.txt>

      This document describes the protocol for the Email-based Convergence
      (MCL) Layer for Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN).

  "RTCWEB Considerations for NATs, Firewalls and HTTP proxies", Thomas
  Stach, Andrew Hutton, Justin Uberti, 2013-06-27,
  <draft-hutton-rtcweb-nat-firewall-considerations-01.txt>

      This document describes mechanism to enable media stream
      establishment for Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWEB) in
      the presence of network address translators, firewalls and HTTP
      proxies.  HTTP proxy and firewall policies applied in many private
      network domains introduce obstacles to the successful establishment
      of media stream via RTCWEB.  This document examines some of these
      policies and develops requirements on the web browsers designed to
      provide the best possible chance of media connectivity between RTCWEB
      peers.

  "Terminology in IPv6 over Timeslotted Channel Hopping", Maria
  Palattella, Pascal Thubert, Thomas Watteyne, Qin Wang, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-palattella-6tsch-terminology-01.txt>

      6TSCH proposes an architecture for an IPv6 multilink subnet that is
      composed of a high speed powered backbone and a number of
      IEEE802.15.4e TSCH wireless networks attached and synchronized by
      backbone routers.  This document extends existing terminology
      documents available for Low-power and Lossy Networks to provide
      additional terminology elements.

  "Advice on network buffering", Gorry Fairhurst, Bob Briscoe, 2013-03-11,
  <draft-fairhurst-tsvwg-buffers-00.txt>

      This document proposes an update to the advice given in RFC 3819.
      Subsequent research has altered understanding of buffer sizing and
      queue management.  Therefore this document significantly revises the
      previous recommendations on buffering.  The advice applies to all
      packet buffers, whether in network equipment, end hosts or
      middleboxes such as firewalls or NATs.  And the advice applies to
      packet buffers at any layer: whether subnet, IP, transport or
      application.

  "Painless Class 1 Devices Programming", Oliver Hahm, Emmanuel Baccelli,
  Kaspar Schleiser, 2013-03-11,
  <draft-hahm-lwig-painless-constrained-programming-00.txt>

      In order to fit the constraints of Class 0 devices (offering much
      less than 10KiB of RAM and 100KiB of ROM) there are no alternatives
      to implementing IP protocols in special software environments, which
      impose programming paradigms that make implementation of protocol
      specifications significantly more complex.  However, our experience
      implementing RFC 4944 and RFC 6282, TCP and UDP on Class 1 devices
      (offering approximately 10KiB of RAM and 100KiB of ROM) shows that
      there are alternatives concerning software environments in which to
      implement IP protocols, which avoid such complexity by providing a
      more developer-friendly environment.  This draft shares this
      experience.

  "I2RS overlay use case", fangwei hu, Bhumip Khasnabish, 2013-07-07,
  <draft-hu-i2rs-overlay-use-case-01.txt>

      This document proposes an overlay network use case.  The forwarding
      routers network is an overlay structure.  There are two kinds of
      forwarding routers: Edge Router(ER) and Core Routers(CR).  Edge
      Router encapsulates format data based on the tunnel type, which are
      established among Edge Routers.  Core Router would be very simple and
      cheap.  It focus on the encapsulation data forwarding.  In order to
      reduce the equipment cost of Edge Routers, the network virtualization
      is provided in this document.

  "Augmented Password-Authenticated Key Exchange for Transport Layer
  Security (TLS)", SeongHan Shin, Kazukuni Kobara, 2013-03-11,
  <draft-shin-tls-augpake-00.txt>

      This document describes an efficient augmented password-authenticated
      key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user remembers a low-entropy
      password and its verifier is registered in the intended server.  In
      general, the user password is chosen from a small set of dictionary
      whose space is within the off-line dictionary attacks.  The AugPAKE
      protocol described here is secure against passive attacks, active
      attacks and off-line dictionary attacks (on the obtained messages
      with passive/active attacks), and also provides resistance to server
      compromise (in the context of augmented PAKE security).  Based on the
      AugPAKE protocol, this document also specifies a new password-only
      authentication handshake for Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

  "mLDP extensions for integrating EVPN and multicast", David Allan, Jeff
  Tantsura, 2013-07-15, <draft-allan-l2vpn-mldp-evpn-01.txt>

      This document describes how mLDP FECs can be encoded to support both
      service specific and shared multicast trees and describes the
      associated procedures for EVPN PEs. Thus, mLDP can implement
      multicast for EVPN.

  "Mark and Signed Mark Objects Mapping", Gustavo Lozano, 2013-03-25,
  <draft-lozano-tmch-smd-02.txt>

      This document describes the format of a mark and a digitally signed
      mark, referred to as a signed mark and the Signed Mark Data (SMD)
      file as defined by the ICANN Trademark Clearinghouse.

  "6tus Layer Specification", Qin Wang, Xavier Vilajosana, Thomas
  Watteyne, 2013-05-23, <draft-wang-6tsch-6tus-01.txt>

      The recently published [IEEE802154e] standard formalizes the concept
      of link-layer resources in LLNs.  Nodes are synchronized and follow a
      schedule.  A time slot in that schedule corresponds to an atomic
      link-layer resource, and can be allocated to any pair of neighbors in
      the network.  This allows the schedule to be built to tightly match
      each node's bandwidth, latency and energy constraints, while ensuring
      collision-free communication.  The [IEEE802154e] standard does not,
      however, present a mechanism to do so, as building and managing the
      schedule is out of the standard's scope.  Routing layers such as the
      IETF IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) provide a mechanism to
      route multipoint-to-point traffic (from devices inside the LLN
      towards a central control point) and point-to-multipoint traffic
      (from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN).
      Network layer overlays cannot be optimized and adapted to take
      advantage of the cell-based topology created by the underlying TSCH
      MAC layer as a missing set of functionalities need to be defined.
      This document describes the 6tus layer and the main commands it
      provides to upper network layers such as RPL or GMPLS.  The set of
      functionalities includes feedback metrics from cell states so network
      layers can take routing decisions, TSCH configuration and control
      procedures, and the support for centralized and decentralized
      scheduling policies.

  "An Architecture for IPv6 over Timeslotted Channel Hopping", Pascal
  Thubert, Robert Assimiti, Thomas Watteyne, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-thubert-6tsch-architecture-02.txt>

      This document presents an architecture for an IPv6 multilink subnet
      that is composed of a high speed powered backbone and a number of
      IEEE802.15.4e TSCH wireless networks attached and synchronized by
      Backbone Routers.  Route Computation may be achieved in a centralized
      fashion by a Path Computation Element, in a distributed fashion using
      the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks, or in a mixed
      mode.  The Backbone Routers perform proxy Neighbor discovery
      operations over the backbone on behalf of the wireless device, so
      they can share a same subnet and appear to be connected to the same
      backbone as classical devices.

  "pNFS Metadata Striping", Matt Benjamin, Casey Bodley, Adam Emerson,
  Pranoop Ersani, Peter Honeyman, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-mbenjamin-nfsv4-pnfs-metastripe-01.txt>

      This Internet-Draft describes a means to add metadata striping to
      pNFS.  The text of this draft is substantially based on prior drafts
      by Eisler, M., with some departures.  The current draft attempts to
      define a somewhat lighter-weight protocol, in particular, seeks to
      permit striping for "filehandle only" operations such as LOCK and
      OPEN + CLAIM_FH, without clients having to obtain metadata layouts on
      regular files.  We gratefully acknowledge the primary contributions
      of Mike Eisler, Pranoop Ersani, and others.

  "LISP Based FlowMapping for Scaling NFV",  sbarkai@gmail.com, Dino
  Farinacci, David Meyer, Fabio Maino, Vina Ermagan, 2013-07-02,
  <draft-barkai-lisp-nfv-02.txt>

      This draft describes an RFC 6830 Locator ID Separation Protocol
      (LISP) based distributed flow-mapping-fabric for dynamic scaling of
      virtualized network functions (NFV).  Network functions such as
      subscriber-management, content-optimization, security and quality of
      service, are typically delivered using proprietary hardware
      appliances embedded into the network as turn-key service-nodes or
      service-blades within routers.  Next generation network functions are
      being implemented as pure software instances running on standard
      servers - unbundled virtualized components of capacity and
      functionality.  LISP-SDN based flow-mapping, dynamically assembles
      these components to whole solutions by steering the right traffic in
      the right sequence to the right virtual function instance.

  "Multipath RTP based on RTP Relay Application (MPRTP-RA)", Lei Weimin,
  Wei Zhang, Shaowei Liu, 2013-03-12,
  <draft-leiwm-avtcore-mprtp-ra-00.txt>

      This document defines the framework of multipath transmission of real-
      time
      media based on relay. The framework allows participants to use
      multiple
      paths,including the default IP path and relay paths, to
      transport media in a
      RTP session. A relay path may via one or more RTP
      relay nodes which provide
      relay services for media data. This framework
      describes function blocks and
      behaviors of MPRTP-RA-capable RTP agent
      and RTP relay. The framework also
      defines multipath transport protocol
      by extending RTP, and relay control
      protocol named OpenPath.

  "HTTP/2.0 Discussion: Using Multiple Request URI's in Idempotent and
  Safe Requests", James Snell, 2013-03-12,
  <draft-snell-httpbis-mget-00.txt>

      This memo describes a proposed mechanism for specifying multiple
      request URI's within Idempotent methods (i.e.  "Multi-GET", "Multi-
      Delete")

  "Default Border Definition", Erik Kline, 2013-03-12,
  <draft-kline-homenet-default-perimeter-00.txt>

      Automatic, simple identification of when traffic is crossing a
      perimeter is highly desirable for a variety of home network uses.
      This document describes how to use homenet routing protocol
      adjacencies as the primary signal of a common administrative domain
      (e.g. "the home").  Classification of interfaces et cetera as
      internal or external follow from this, as do various policy and
      implementation implications.  One fundamental implication is that the
      active definition of a home network's interior is no more secure than
      its policy for forming homenet routing protocol adjacencies.

  "TMCH functional specifications", Gustavo Lozano, 2013-05-13,
  <draft-lozano-tmch-func-spec-06.txt>

      This document describes the requirements, the architecture and the
      interfaces between the Trademark Clearing House (TMCH) and Domain
      Name Registries as well as between the TMCH and Domain Name
      Registrars for the provisioning and management of domain names during
      Sunrise and Trademark Claims Periods.

  "Segment Routing with IS-IS Routing Protocol", Stefano Previdi, Clarence
  Filsfils, Ahmed Bashandy, Martin Horneffer, Bruno Decraene, Stephane
  Litkowski, Igor Milojevic, Rob Shakir, Saku Ytti, Wim Henderickx, Jeff
  Tantsura, 2013-03-21,
  <draft-previdi-filsfils-isis-segment-routing-02.txt>

      Segment Routing (SR) enables any node to select any path (explicit or
      derived from IGPs SPT computations) for each of its traffic classes.
      The path does not depend on a hop-by-hop signaling technique (neither
      LDP nor RSVP).  It only depends on a set of "segments" that are
      advertised by the IS-IS routing protocol.  These segments act as
      topological sub-paths that can be combined together to form the
      desired path.
      
      There are two forms of segments: node and adjacency.  A node segment
      represents a path to a node.  An adjacency segment represents a
      specific adjacency to a node.  A node segment is typically a multi-
      hop path while an adjacency segment is a one-hop path.  SR's control-
      plane can be applied to IPv6 and MPLS dataplanes.
      
      Segment Routing control-plane can be applied to the MPLS dataplane: a
      node segment to node N is instantiated in the MPLS dataplane as an
      LSP along the shortest-path (SPT) to the node.  An adjacency segment
      is instantiated in the MPLS dataplane as a cross-connect entry
      pointing to a specific egress datalink.
      
      This document describes the Segment Routing functions, a set of use
      cases it addresses and the necessary changes that are required in the
      IS-IS protocol.

  "ISSU Benchmarking Methodology", Sarah Banks, Fer, Gery Czirjak, Ramdas
  Machat, 2013-06-04, <draft-banks-bmwg-issu-meth-01.txt>

      Modern forwarding devices attempt to minimize any control and data
      plane disruptions while performing planned software changes, by
      implementing a technique commonly known as an In Service Software
      Upgrade (ISSU).
      
      This document specifies a set of common methodologies and procedures
      designed to characterize the overall behavior of a Device Under Test
      (DUT) subject to an ISSU event.

  "Supporting the Signal Degrade in the PSC Linear Protection", Jeong-dong
  Ryoo, Huub van Helvoort, Alessandro D'Alessandro, 2013-03-12,
  <draft-rhd-mpls-tp-psc-sd-00.txt>

      This document contains the updates to [RFC6378], "MPLS Transport
      Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection" to support protection against
      signal degrade (SD) in an effort to satisfy the ITU-T's protection
      switching requirements.

  "Upgrading the 100-CONTINUE status for Broadcast in HTTP/1.1 Protocol",
  Raji Sankar, 2013-03-13, <draft-bt-http-broadcast-00.txt,.pdf>

      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 in RFC 2616 uses the
      100-Continue status message with Expect: Continue header to send
      request body at a later time to the origin server.  This memo
      explains how to extend this status message to send multiple responses
      from the origin server to the client for an extended period of time.
      This achieves the essential function of broadcast from the origin
      server to the client, without the client waiting for a response to a
      request.

  "Authentication-Results Registration for S/MIME signature verification",
  Alexey Melnikov, 2013-04-19,
  <draft-melnikov-authentication-results-smime-01.txt>

      RFC 5451 specifies the Authentication-Results header field for
      conveying results of message authentication checks.  This document
      defines a new authentication method to be used in the Authentication-
      Results header field for S/MIME related signature checks.

  "VPLS external Loop Protection Mechanism (VLPM)", Richard Boldy,
  2013-05-02, <draft-l2vpn-vlpm-02.txt>

      In reference and response to draft-boldy-l2vpn-vplsloop-req-01,
      this document describes a solution in the form of a protocol
      function named VPLS External Loop Protection Mechanism (VLPM).
      
      VLPM is a protocol for a service provider to deploy at the PE to
      detect layer-2 loops in any external layer-2 segments (customer LAN)
      where customer deployed loop prevention methods may have failed.
      
      After detection of such a loop it facilitates configurable actions
      to protect the rest of the VPLS Domain from being affected without
      the need for inter-operation with customer network protocols, other
      VPLS PEs or sites.

  "A Framework for Measuring Network Complexity", Alvaro Retana, Russ
  White, 2013-03-14, <draft-retana-network-complexity-framework-00.txt>

      Network architecture revolves around the concept of fitting the
      design of a network to its purpose; of asking the question, "what
      network will best fit these needs?"  A part of fitting network design
      to requirements is the problem of complexity, an idea often measured
      by "seat of pants" methods.  When would adding a particular protocol,
      policy, or configuration be "too complex?"  This document suggests a
      series of continuums along which network complexity might be
      measured.  No suggestions are made in measuring complexity for each
      of these continuums are provided; this is left for future documents.

  "HTTP Client Hints", Ilya Grigorik, 2013-03-15,
  <draft-grigorik-http-client-hints-00.txt>

      An increasing diversity of connected device form factors and software
      capabilities has created a need to deliver varying, or optimized
      content for each device.
      
      Client Hints can be used as input to proactive content negotiation;
      just as the Accept header allowed clients to indicate what formats
      they prefer, Client Hints allow clients to indicate a list of device
      and agent specific preferences.

  "IETF Recommendations Regarding Active Queue Management", Fred Baker,
  Gorry Fairhurst, 2013-07-09, <draft-baker-aqm-recommendation-02.txt>

      This memo presents recommendations to the Internet community
      concerning measures to improve and preserve Internet performance.  It
      presents a strong recommendation for testing, standardization, and
      widespread deployment of active queue management (AQM) in network
      devices, to improve the performance of today's Internet.  It also
      urges a concerted effort of research, measurement, and ultimate
      deployment of AQM mechanisms to protect the Internet from flows that
      are not sufficiently responsive to congestion notification.
      
      The note largely repeats the recommendations of RFC 2309, updated
      after fifteen years of experience and new research.

  "The Salsa20 Stream Cipher for Transport Layer Security", Simon
  Josefsson, Joachim Strombergson, Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos, 2013-04-09,
  <draft-josefsson-salsa20-tls-02.txt>

      This document describe how the Salsa20 stream cipher can be used in
      the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer
      Security (DTLS) protocols.

  "XML Schemas for Reverse DNS Management", Terry Manderson, 2013-03-19,
  <draft-manderson-rdns-xml-01.txt>

      This document defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema for
      Reverse DNS Management in a tightly controlled Representational State
      Transfer (REST) environment.  This document describes a schema that
      has been developed and deployed by ICANN in a "RESTful" based system
      since 2011 and is being used by the registries responsible for
      reverse DNS (rDNS) delegations underneath IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA
      through an X.509 certificate mediated HTTPS transaction.

  "Resource Records for EUI-48 and EUI-64 Addresses in the DNS", Joe
  Abley, 2013-06-12, <draft-jabley-dnsext-eui48-eui64-rrtypes-05.txt>

      48-bit Extended Unique Identifiers (EUI-48) and 64-bit Extended
      Unique Identifiers (EUI-64) are address formats specified by the IEEE
      for use in various layer-2 networks, e.g.  Ethernet.
      
      This document describes two new DNS resource record types, EUI48 and
      EUI64, for encoding Ethernet addresses in the DNS.
      
      This document describes potentially severe privacy implications
      resulting from indiscriminate publication of link-layer addresses in
      the DNS.  This document recommends that EUI-48 or EUI-64 addresses
      SHOULD NOT be published in the public DNS.  This document specifies
      an interoperable encoding of these address types for use in private
      DNS namespaces, where the privacy concerns can be constrained and
      mitigated.

  "A Liveness Protocol for PSC", Eric Osborne, 2013-03-19,
  <draft-osborne-mpls-psc-alive-00.txt>

      This document adds a liveness protocol to PSC which provides
      functionality similar to APS's EXER command.  It also provides some
      rules for processing TLVs in PSC messages which apply to all future
      uses of PSC TLVs.

  "A SASL and GSS-API Mechanism for the BrowserID Authentication
  Protocol", Luke Howard, Nico Williams, 2013-04-25,
  <draft-howard-gss-browserid-04.txt>

      This document defines protocols, procedures and conventions for a
      Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
      security mechanism based on the BrowserID authentication mechanism.
      Through the GS2 family of mechanisms defined in RFC 5801, these
      protocols also define how Simple Authentication and Security Layer
      (SASL, RFC 4422) applications may use BrowserID.

  "Software-Defined Networking: A Service Provider's Perspective", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet, 2013-06-05,
  <draft-sin-sdnrg-sdn-approach-03.txt>

      Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been one of the major buzz
      words of the networking industry for the past couple of years.  And
      yet, no clear definition of what SDN actually covers has been broadly
      admitted so far.  This document aims at contributing to the
      clarification of the SDN landscape by discussing a service provider's
      perspective on requirements, issues and other considerations about
      SDN.
      
      It is not meant to endlessly discuss what SDN truly means, but rather
      to suggest a functional taxonomy of the techniques that can be used
      under a SDN umbrella and to elaborate on the various pending issues
      the combined activation of such techniques inevitably raises.  As
      such, a definition of SDN is only mentioned for the sake of
      clarification.

  "VPLS External Loop Detection and Protection Requirements", Richard
  Boldy, 2013-03-22, <draft-boldy-l2vpn-vplsloop-req-01.txt>

      Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) implementations, as defined in
      [RFC4761] and [RFC4762], are highly susceptible to layer-2 loops
      external to the PE customer-facing interface. Such loops impact
      performance and can have a detrimental affect on all VPLS traffic
      throughout the entire instance under certain conditions.
      
      Current Layer-2 loop detection and protection mechanisms do not
      function effectively here.
      
      This document describes the requirements for a protocol function
      to offer VPLS service providers a mechanism for detecting such
      layer-2 loops and facilitating configurable actions without the
      need for inter-operation with customer network protocols, other
      VPLS PEs or customer sourced frames.

  "EUI-48 and EUI-64 Address Assignments for use in Documentation", Joe
  Abley, 2013-03-21, <draft-jabley-eui48-eui64-doc-addr-00.txt>

      48-bit Extended Unique Identifiers (EUI-48) and 64-bit Extended
      Unique Identifiers (EUI-64) are address formats specified by the IEEE
      for use in various layer-2 networks, e.g. ethernet.
      
      This document describes an allocation of EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses
      under the IANA Organisationally Unique Identifier (OUI) to be used
      for the purposes of documentation.

  "JOSE Security Parameters Index", Richard Barnes, 2013-03-21,
  <draft-barnes-jose-spi-00.txt>

      The use cases for JOSE include cases where a given sender and
      receiver use an out-of-band mechanism to negotiate cryptographic
      parameters, so that these parameters do not have to appear in a JOSE
      object.  This document proposed a modification to the JOSE formats to
      allow for signaling that pre-negotiated parameters are being used,
      and if so, which parameters.

  "Mounting YANG-Defined Information from Remote Datastores", Alex Clemm,
  Jan Medved, Eric Voit, 2013-03-21, <draft-clemm-netmod-mount-00.txt>

      This document introduces a new capability that allows YANG datastores
      to reference and incorporate information from remote datastores.
      This is accomplished using a new YANG data model that allows to
      define and manage datastore mount points that reference data nodes in
      remote datastores.  The data model includes a set of YANG extensions
      for the purposes of declaring such mount points.

  "The Interconnection and Interoperability of Different Cloud-office
  Applications (IDCOA) with the HTML File Format", Zhun Guo, 2013-03-22,
  <draft-guo-idoca-with-the-html-file-format-00.txt>

      At present, the collaboration of documents in a single cloud-office
      Website works wonderfully.  However, the one among different cloud-
      office websites is a little clumsy.  This document analyzes the
      status quo of the collaboration of documents among those existing
      different cloud-office websites and provides a solution how to
      realize IDCOA (the interconnection and interoperability of different
      cloud-office applications) with the html file format.

  "Service Coverage Scope for Service URN", Daniel Mongrain, 2013-03-25,
  <draft-mongrain-ecrit-service-coverage-scope-urn-00.txt>

      This document specifies a mechanism to specify a Service Coverage
      Scope in a Service URN [RFC5031] when multiple providers provide the
      same service for the same location.

  "Architecture Discussion of I2RS", Dapeng Liu, Bhumip Khasnabish, Hui
  Deng, 2013-07-15, <draft-liu-i2rs-architecture-02.txt>

      This document discusses the high level architecture of I2RS.  This
      document also provides brief descriptions on the use of
      virtualization and its impact on constructing chained and grouped
      services.  We plan to include further details on virtualization,
      service chaining, and grouping in a future version of this draft.

  "A Summary of Various Mechanisms Deployed at L-Root for the
  Identification of Anycast Nodes", Joe Abley, 2013-06-24,
  <draft-jabley-dnsop-anycast-mapping-02.txt>

      Anycast is a deployment technique commonly employed for
      authoritative-only servers in the Domain Name System (DNS).  L-Root,
      one of the thirteen root servers, is deployed in this fashion.
      
      Various techniques have been used to map deployed anycast
      infrastructure externally, i.e. without reference to inside knowledge
      about where and how such infrastructure has been deployed.
      Motivations for performing such measurement exercises include
      operational troubleshooting and infrastructure risk assessment.  In
      the specific case of L-Root, the ability to measure and map anycast
      infrastructure using the techniques mentioned in this document is
      provided for reasons of operational transparency.
      
      This document describes all facilities deployed at L-Root to
      facilitate mapping of its infrastructure and serves as documentation
      for L-Root as a measurable service.

  "X.509v3 TLS Feature Extension", Phillip Hallam-Baker, 2013-04-24,
  <draft-hallambaker-tlsfeature-02.txt,.pdf>

      The purpose of the TLS Feature extension is to prevent downgrade
      attacks that are not otherwise prevented by the TLS protocol.  In
      particular, the TLS Feature extension may be used to mandate support
      for revocation checking features in the TLS protocol such as OCSP
      stapling.  Informing clients that an OCSP status response will always
      be stapled permits an immediate failure in the case that the response
      is not stapled.  This in turn prevents a denial of service attack
      that might otherwise be possible.

  "Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) Domain Name Mapping Extension
  for Chinese Domain Names", Zheng Wang, 2013-03-27,
  <draft-wang-epp-cdn-mapping-00.txt>

      This document describes an extension of Extensible Provisioning
      Protocol (EPP) domain name mapping for the provisioning and
      management of Chinese Domain Names (CDNs). Specified in XML, this
      extended mapping is applied to provide additional features required
      by CDNs Registration.

  "Carrier-Grade-NAT (CGN) Deployment Considerations.", Kaname Nishizuka,
  2013-03-28, <draft-nishizuka-cgn-deployment-considerations-00.txt>

      This document provides deployment considerations for Carrier-Grade-
      NAT (CGN) based on the verification result include the investigation
      of the number of sessions of applications.  The verification was
      conducted in StarBED which is one of the largest scale network
      experiment environment in Japan.  A million of subscribers was
      emulated and it revealed the realistic behavior of CGN.

  "Multiplexing Negotiation Using ICE Candidate Extension", Andrew Hutton,
  Thomas Stach, 2013-03-28,
  <draft-hutton-mmusic-bundled-ice-candidates-00.txt,.pdf>

      This document describes a mechanism for extending ICE candidates with
      an optional parameter which can be used to negotiate the usage of
      bundled media, which refers to the usage of a single 5-tuple for
      multiple RTP streams.  In a scenario where a party initiating the
      negotiation supports ICE [RFC5245] this mechanism provides the
      ability to provide an SDP offer which is both backwards compatible
      and able to fully specify the use of bundled media.  Therefore, this
      mechanism allows bundled and non-bundled media to be negotiated in a
      single offer/answer exchange when both parties support ICE and this
      extension.  The mechanism complements the procedures described in
      [draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation].

  "MLDv2 Procedures for Link-Layer Unicast Delivery of Multicast IPv6",
  Mark Smith, 2013-03-28, <draft-smith-mldv2-link-unicast-00.txt>

      Some multi-access link-layer technologies typically not provide good
      IPv6 multicast performance, using link-layer multicasts, when the
      volume of multicast traffic is significant.  It would be possible to
      replicate and then link-layer unicast multicast IPv6 traffic to
      interested listeners to overcome these link-layer performance
      limitations.  This memo describes MLDv2 and IPv6 neighbor discovery
      procedures to support link-layer unicast delivery of multicast IPv6
      traffic.

  "Why Reactive Protocols are Ill-Suited for LLNs", Joydeep Tripathi, Jau,
  C. Chauvenet, JP Vasseur, 2013-07-06,
  <draft-tripathi-roll-reactive-applicability-01.txt>

      This document describes serious issues and shortcomings regarding the
      use of reactive routing protocols in low power and lossy networks
      (LLNs).  Routing requirements for various LLN deployments are
      discussed in order to judge how reactive routing may or may not
      adhere to the necessary criteria.

  "ULA IPv6 Address Prefix Reserved for Documentation", Owen, 2013-03-29,
  <draft-delong-ula-example-00.txt>

      To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating
      documented examples to deployed systems, an IPv6 Unicast Address
      prefix is reserved for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation,
      and the like.
      
      Since the publication of [RFC 4193] (ULA), it is necessary to
      provide examples of ULA addresses in various documents, including
      some Internet-Drafts currently under consideration.
      
      This draft seeks to add ULA prefixes reserved for documentation
      purposes similar to the GUA reservation specified in [RFC3489]

  "Profile Support for the Atom Syndication Format", Erik Wilde,
  2013-07-29, <draft-wilde-atom-profile-02.txt>

      The Atom syndication format is a generic XML format for representing
      collections.  Profiles are one way how Atom feeds can indicate that
      they support specific extensions.  To make this support visible on
      the media type level, this specification adds an optional "profile"
      media type parameter to the Atom media type.  This allows profiles to
      become visible at the media type level, so that servers as well as
      clients can indicate support for specific Atom profiles in
      conversations, for example when communicating via HTTP.  This
      specification updates RFC 4287 by adding the "profile" media type
      parameter to the application/atom+xml media type registration.

  "Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance
  (DMARC)", Murray Kucherawy, Elizabeth Zwicky, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-kucherawy-dmarc-base-01.txt>

      This memo presents a proposal for a scalable mechanism by which a
      mail sending organization can express, using the Domain Name System,
      domain-level policies and preferences for message validation,
      disposition, and reporting, and a mail receiving organization can use
      those policies and preferences to improve mail handling.
      
      The email ecosystem currently lacks a cohesive mechanism through
      which email senders and receivers can make use of multiple
      authentication protocols to establish reliable domain identifiers,
      communicate policies about those identifiers, and report about mail
      using those identifiers.  This lack of cohesion has several effects:
      receivers have difficulty providing feedback to senders about
      authentication, senders therefore have difficulty evaluating their
      authentication deployments, and as a result neither is able to make
      effective use of existing authentication technology
      
      The enclosed proposal is not intended to introduce mechanisms that
      provide elevated delivery privilege of authenticated email.  The
      proposal presents a mechanism for policy distribution that enables a
      continuum of increasingly strict handling of messages that fail
      multiple authentication checks, from no action, through altered
      delivery, up to message rejection.

  "Direct Random Access File Transfer", Diana Raft, 2013-04-01,
  <draft-draft-draft-00.txt>

      Network file access is often highly inefficient due to complexity of
      existing protocols.  Direct Random Access File Transfer (DRAFT) is
      one new protocol that uses simple UDP techniques to overcome this
      problem.

  "Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation", Scott Burleigh, 2013-04-01,
  <draft-irtf-burleigh-bibe-00.txt>

      This document describes Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation (BIBE), a
      Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol (BP) "convergence
      layer" protocol that tunnels BP "bundles" through encapsulating
      bundles.  The services provided by the BIBE convergence-layer
      protocol adapter encapsulate an outbound BP "bundle" in a BIBE
      convergence-layer protocol data unit for transmission as the payload
      of a bundle.  Security measures applied to the encapsulating bundle
      may augment those applied to the encapsulated bundle.

  "Remote Laboratory Control Protocol", Evgeny Efimchick, 2013-04-01,
  <draft-efimchick-remotelaboratorycontrolprotocol-00.txt>

      This protocol is intended to provide the interaction between servers
      of virtual or remote laboratories and educational information systems
      that use virtual or remote laboratories in educational process.

  "Home Documents for HTTP Services: XML Syntax", Erik Wilde, 2013-06-11,
  <draft-wilde-home-xml-01.txt>

      The current draft for HTTP Home Documents provides a JSON syntax
      only.  This draft provides an XML syntax for the same underlying data
      model, so that the concept of HTTP Home Documents can be consistently
      exposed in both JSON- and XML-based HTTP services.
      
      Note to Readers
      
      Please discuss this draft on the apps-discuss mailing list [7].
      
      Online access to all versions and files is available on github [8].

  "ICANN Registry Interfaces", Gustavo Lozano, 2013-06-26,
  <draft-lozano-icann-registry-interfaces-01.txt>

      This document describes the interfaces provided by ICANN to Registry
      Operators in order to fulfill the requirements of Specification 2 and
      3 of the New gTLD Base Agreement.  The interface provided by ICANN to
      Data Escrow Agents in order to fulfill the requirements of
      Specification 2 of the New gTLD Base Agreement is also described in
      this document.

  "Node protecting remote LFA", Stephane Litkowski, 2013-04-02,
  <draft-litkowski-rtgwg-node-protect-remote-lfa-00.txt>

      This draft describes a simple extension to the remote LFA
      specification that computes a guaranteed node protection.

  "The IETF Profile URI Registry", Markus Lanthaler, 2013-06-16,
  <draft-lanthaler-profile-registry-02.txt>

      This document defines a registry for profile URIs to be used in
      specifications standardizing profiles.

  "ForCES Protocol Extensions", Jamal Hadi Salim, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-jhs-forces-protoextenstion-01.txt>

      Experience in implementing and deploying ForCES architecture has
      demonstrated need for a few small extensions both to ease
      programmability and to improve wire efficiency of some transactions.
      This document describes a few extensions to the ForCES Protocol
      Specification [RFC5810] semantics to achieve that end goal.

  "HTTP Session Management", Phillip Hallam-Baker, 2013-05-14,
  <draft-hallambaker-httpsession-01.txt,.pdf>

      The HTTP Session Management Mechanism provides a mean of securely
      establishing a persistent authentication session between a HTTP
      client and server that does not rely on the presentation of a
      confidential bearer token.  The Session Management Mechanism is
      intended to provide a replacement for the existing HTTP State
      Management Mechanism (Cookies) for this purpose.
      
      This document defines the HTTP Accept-Session, Set-Session and
      Session headers and specifies their use to establish symmetric
      authentication keys and their use to authenticate and verify specific
      parts of an HTTP message.  Other means by which keys used to
      authenticate the messages are established are outside the scope of
      this document.

  "Proposed Refactoring of JOSE to Align Encryption and Key Wrapping",
  Richard Barnes, 2013-05-05, <draft-barnes-jose-key-wrapping-01.txt>

      The discussions around key wrapping in the JOSE working group have
      raised new requirements for wrapped keys, namely: (1) Wrapping keys
      other than symmetric keys, (2) cryptographically binding attributes
      to keys, and (3) allowing the use of AEAD cryptographic algorithms
      for key wrapping (other than AES-KW).  This document proposes a
      refactoring of the JOSE document set that provides a cleaner
      conceptual structure for JWS / JWE and transparent support for
      wrapped keys, all with a relatively minor impact on the compact form
      of JWS and JWE objects.

  "Survey of MPTCP Implementations", Philip Eardley, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-eardley-mptcp-implementations-survey-02.txt>

      This document presents results from the survey to gather information
      from people who have implemented MPTCP, in particular to help
      progress the protocol from Experimental to Standards track.
      
      The document currently includes answers from four teams: a Linux
      implementation from UCLouvain, a FreeBSD implementation from
      Swinburne, an anonymous implementation in a commercial OS, and a
      NetScalar Firmware implementation from Citrix Systems, Inc. Thank-
      you!
      
      In summary, we have four independent implementations of all the MPTCP
      signalling messages, with the exception of address management, and
      some interoperabiity testing has been done by the other three
      implementations with the 'reference' Linux implementation.  So it
      appears that the RFC is (at least largely) clear and correct.  On
      address management, we have only one implementation of ADD_ADDR with
      two teams choosing not to implement it.  We have one implementation
      of the working group's coupled congestion control (RFC6356) and none
      of the MPTCP-aware API (RFC6897).
      
      The main suggested improvements are around
      
      o  how MPTCP falls back (if the signalling is interrupted by a
      middlebox): (1) corner cases that are not handled properly, (2) at
      the IETF, the MPTCP community should work with middlebox vendors,
      either to reduce or eliminate the need for fallback or to
      understand the middlebox interactions better.
      
      o  security: both better MPTCP security (perhaps building on SSL) and
      a lighter weight mechanism, preferably both in one mechanism.
      
      It is hoped that the next version can include information from any
      other implementations.  If you are an implementer and want to
      contribute your answers, please see the -01 version of this document
      for a blank survey ready to be filled in.

  "DHCPv6 Dynamic DNS Reconfiguration", Dan Wing, Tirumaleswar Reddy,
  Prashanth Patil, Mohamed Boucadair, 2013-06-07,
  <draft-wing-dhc-dns-reconfigure-01.txt>

      Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, and
      IPV6-only hosts at the same time.  This makes prioritizing the DNS
      servers for hosts tricky due to a heterogeneous mix of protocol
      stacks causing optimal behavior to occur only when the host stack re-
      initializes.  The networks infrastructure is usually well equipped to
      be aware of single/dual-stack nature of hosts.  This specification
      extends DHCPv6 so that a DHCPv6 Relay Agent can dynamically influence
      the priority of DNS servers provided to the host, so that the host
      can use an optimal DNS server for resolution.

  "Advertising MPLS labels in IS-IS", Hannes Gredler, Shane Amante, Tom
  Scholl, Luay Jalil, 2013-05-21,
  <draft-gredler-isis-label-advertisement-03.txt>

      Historically MPLS label distribution was driven by protocols like
      LDP, RSVP and LBGP.  All of those protocols are session oriented.  In
      order to obtain a label binding for a given destination FEC from a
      given router one needs first to establish an LDP/RSVP/LBGP session
      with that router.
      
      Advertising MPLS labels in IGPs
      [I-D.gredler-rtgwg-igp-label-advertisement] describes several use
      cases where utilizing the flooding machinery of link-state protocols
      for MPLS label distribution allows to obtain the binding without
      requiring to establish an LDP/RSVP/LBGP session with that router.
      
      This document describes the protocol extension to distribute MPLS
      label bindings using the IS-IS protocol.

  "Design Recommendations for bfd to survive Planned Graceful restart",
  Palanivelan Appanasamy, 2013-04-09,
  <draft-palanivelan-bfd-gr-rec-00.txt>

      Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (bfd) defined in RFC5880 is
      comprehensive and has sufficient mechanisms to overcome challenges in
      surviving Graceful Restart (Planned). However, implementations with
      architectural limitation were found to influence a BFD failure, in a
      process intensive environment.This memo outlines design options to
      overcome the challenges, within the existing bfd framework, in
      surviving planned GracefulRestart.

      [I-D.gredler-rtgwg-igp-label-advertisement] describes several use
      cases where utilizing the flooding machinery of link-state protocols
      for MPLS label distribution allows to obtain the binding without
      requiring to establish an LDP/RSVP/LBGP session with that router.
      
      This document describes the protocol extension to distribute MPLS
      label bindings by the OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocol.

  "IANA Considerations and IETF Protocol and Documentation Usage for IEEE
  802 Parameters", Donald Eastlake, Joe Abley, 2013-06-13,
  <draft-eastlake-rfc5342bis-04.txt>

      Some IETF protocols make use of Ethernet frame formats and IEEE 802
      parameters.  This document discusses some use of such parameters in
      IETF protocols, specifies IANA considerations for assignment of
      points under the IANA OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier), and
      provides some values for use in documentation. This document
      obsoletes RFC 5342.

  "Type-P Descriptor Monitoring in Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol
  (TWAMP)", Jonas Hedin, Greg Mirsky, 2013-06-25,
  <draft-hedin-ippm-type-p-monitor-01.txt>

      This document specifies how optional monitoring of Type-P Descriptor
      can be negotiated and performed by TWAMP [RFC5357] Control and Test
      protocols.

  "Cryptographic Agility for the RSVP INTEGRITY Object", Sean Turner, Lou
  Berger, Mahesh Jethanandani, Keyur Patel, Dacheng Zhang, 2013-04-18,
  <draft-turner-rsvp-auth-update-01.txt>

      This document modifies the RSVP INTEGRITY object to support algorithm
      agility by explicitly indicating the algorithm used.  It also
      provides rationale for the design choices.  Finally, it updates the
      mandatory to implement algorithm.

  "Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Key Package Receipt and Error
  Content Types", Russ Housley, 2013-06-22,
  <draft-housley-ct-keypackage-receipt-n-error-04.txt>

      This document defines the syntax for two Cryptographic Message Syntax
      (CMS) content types, one for key package receipts, and another for
      key package errors.  The key package receipt content type is used to
      confirm receipt of an identified key package or collection of key
      packages.  The key package error content type is used to indicate an
      error occurred during the processing of a key package.  CMS can be
      used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt these
      content types.

  "Algorithms for Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Key Package Receipt
  and Error Content Types", Sean Turner, 2013-05-20,
  <draft-turner-ct-keypackage-receipt-n-error-algs-03.txt>

      This document describes the conventions for using several
      cryptographic algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
      key package receipt and error content types.  Specifically, it
      includes conventions necessary to implement SignedData,
      EnvelopedData, EncryptedData, and AuthEnvelopedData.

  "AES Encryption with HMAC-SHA2 for Kerberos 5", Kelley Burgin, Michael
  Peck, 2013-04-19, <draft-kitten-aes-cts-hmac-sha2-00.txt>

      This document specifies two encryption types and two corresponding
      checksum types for Kerberos 5.  The new types use AES in CTS mode
      (CBC mode with ciphertext stealing) for confidentiality and HMAC with
      a SHA-2 hash for integrity.

  "Techniques for Tracking Inventory Using DHCPv6 DUID", Ted Lemon,
  2013-04-21, <draft-lemon-dhc-inventory-01.txt>

      In the years since DHCPv4 gained widespread popularity, one of the
      uses to which organizations have put it is inventory tracking:
      associating identifiers scanned from packaging with records in an
      inventory database.  This document describes various means for
      accomplishing the same purpose using DHCPv6.  This document also
      updates RFC3315 by clarifying the meaning of some normative language
      regarding the DUID-LL and DUID-LLT DUID types.

  "Problems with STUN Authentication for TURN", Tirumaleswar Reddy, Ram R,
  Muthu Perumal, Alper Yegin, 2013-06-12,
  <draft-reddy-behave-turn-auth-02.txt>

      This document discusses some of the issues with STUN authentication
      for TURN messages.

  "IMAP4 non-synchronizing literals", John Myers, Alexey Melnikov,
  2013-04-23, <draft-melnikov-rfc2088bis-00.txt>

      The Internet Message Access Protocol (RFC 3501) contains the
      "literal" syntactic construct for communicating strings.  When
      sending a literal from client to server, IMAP requires the client to
      wait for the server to send a command continuation request between
      sending the octet count and the string data.  This document specifies
      an alternate form of literal which does not require this network
      round trip.

  "TRILL Over Pseudowires", Lucy Yong, Donald Eastlake, Sam Aldrin, Jon
  Hudson, 2013-04-23, <draft-yong-trill-o-pw-00.txt>

      This document specifies how to interconnect a pair of TRILL
      (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) switch ports using
      pseudowires under existing TRILL and PWE3 (Pseudowire Emulation End-
      to-End) standards.

  "DNS-like system for OID", Noel Torres, 2013-04-24,
  <draft-torres-dnsext-oid-00.txt>

      This file justifies and explains a DNS-like system for storing the
      correspondence between OID names and numbers, as well as some
      additional data that might be deemed useful. It is aimed to be
      implemented as an extension to current DNS mechanisms by the addition of
      some Resource Record and Query types.

  "Non-Gregorian Recurrence Rules in iCalendar", Cyrus Daboo, Gregory
  Yakushev, 2013-07-15, <draft-daboo-icalendar-rscale-01.txt>

      This document defines how non-Gregorian recurrence rules can be
      specified in iCalendar data.

  "TRILL Integrated Routing and Bridging Solution", Hao Weiguo, Li Yizhou,
  2013-07-11, <draft-hao-trill-irb-02.txt>

      Currently, TRILL solution can only provide optimum unicast
      forwarding just for Layer2 traffic of intra-subnet forwarding, not
      for Layer3 traffic(inter-subnet forwarding). In this document, a
      TRILL Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) solution is introduced
      to provide optimum unicast forwarding not just for Layer 2 traffic
      (intra-subnet forwarding), but also for Layer 3 traffic (inter-
      subnet forwarding). In the TRILL IRB scenario, an edge RB MUST
      perform the bridging function for the End Systems that are on the
      same subnet and the IP routing for the End Systems that are on the
      different subnets of same tenant.ESADI extension can be used for
      synchronizing <MAC, IP> correspondence among edge RBridges. To
      reduce the number of ESADI session among edge RBridges, Management
      Data Label for ESADI is suggested to be used.

  "Implementation Experience of Identifier-Locator Network Protocol for
  IPv6 (ILNPv6)", Jun Bi, You Wang, Kai Gao, 2013-04-28,
  <draft-bi-rrg-ilnpv6-implementation-experience-00.txt>

      The Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) defines an
      evolutionary enhancement to IP to address multi-homing, mobility as
      well as other issues. This document provides experience of
      implementing ILNPv6 which is a specific engineering instance of ILNP
      based on IPv6. This document describes the problems arisen and our
      choices to solve the issues which may be helpful to others in
      implementing the protocol.

  "The application/firmware, application/firmware-receipt, and
  application/firmware-error media types", Sean Turner, Russ Housley,
  2013-04-30, <draft-turner-application-firmware-media-types-00.txt>

      This document registers the application/firmware,
      application/firmware-receipt and application/firmware-error media
      media types for use with the corresponding CMS (Cryptographic Message
      Syntax) content types defined in RFC 4108.

  "OSPFv3 LSA Extendibility", Acee Lindem, Sina Mirtorabi, Abhay Roy, Fred
  Baker, 2013-07-15, <draft-acee-ospfv3-lsa-extend-01.txt>

      OSPFv3 requires functional extension beyond what can be done with the
      fixed Link State Advertisement (LSA) format as described in RFC 5340.
      This document extends the LSA format by allowing the optional
      inclusion of Type-Length-Value (TLV) tuples in the LSAs.  It also
      covers all aspects of backward compatibility.

  "A Procedure for Cautious Delegation of a DNS Name", Olaf Kolkman,
  Andrew Sullivan, Warren Kumari, 2013-08-01,
  <draft-kolkman-cautious-delegation-02.txt>

      NOTE: The authors recognize that the statistical models that would
      inform the process are not well understood and that the possibilities
      to game the system might be unmountable.  Unless we reach more
      insights on how to deal with this details this work is abandoned.
      
      Sometimes, a DNS name is known to be in use in the wild even though
      it was never properly delegated.  This situation appears
      particularly, but not only, true in certain domains near the root of
      the tree: people have independently used those non-existent top-level
      domains as private namespaces.  If those names are to be delegated in
      the public DNS, prudence dictates that collisions between the private
      uses and the public use be minimized.  We outline a procedure to
      evaluate the harm of delegation.

  "Router Advertisement based privacy extension in IPv6
  autoconfiguration",  Hosnieh, Christoph Meinel, 2013-06-18,
  <draft-rafiee-6man-ra-privacy-04.txt>

      Privacy is an important issue which concerns many governments and
      users, with its importance becoming more evident every day. Nodes
      change their IP addresses frequently in order to avoid being tracked
      by attackers. The act of frequently changing IP addresses also helps
      to prevent the leakage of information by nodes. In IPv6 networks
      there is currently one solution for maintaining the privacy of nodes
      when IPv6 StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) (RFC 4862) is
      used. Unfortunately there are some problems associated with this
      solution which entails the use of the Privacy Extension (RFC 4941).
      One of the issues with this RFC concerns the wording that is used
      which allows the implementation to make the choice as to what
      approach to use and in so doing, in some cases, the choice made is
      not the most prudent or best approach and this is not ideal and can
      cause some problems. Some of these problems are concerned with not
      generating a new Interface ID (IID) after changing the router prefix.
      Another concern would be the fact that nodes may use an IID that was
      generated based on a MAC address as a public address, and then use
      this in their response. The act of cutting the current connections to
      other nodes, if the max lifetime of the old IID has elapsed, is also
      not clearly explained nor is whether or not the already used IID
      should be kept in stable storage, There is also a concern about the
      need to have stable storage available for the generation of a
      randomized IID. The RFC gives no explanation as to how to make use of
      CGA in its randomizing solution when stable storage is not available
      or how to use the same approach for random value generation in all
      implementations where there is a lack of stable storage. The purpose
      of this document is to address these issues, to update the current
      RFC and to introduce a new algorithm for the lifetime of IID.

  "IPv6 Email Authentication", Douglas Otis, David Rand, 2013-05-09,
  <draft-otis-ipv6-email-authent-01.txt>

      IPv6 facilitates network routing over an incredibly vast address
      space, but abuse mitigation resolving to underlying structures of
      routes or blocks of prefixes would be highly disruptive due to
      collateral effects.  Use of domains minimizes unintended coincidental
      blocking while offering the consolidation necessary to facilitate
      connection management.  Currently, email lacks conventions ensuring
      SMTP clients can be identified by an authenticated domain.
      
      DKIM is independent of intended recipients and domains accountable
      for having sent email.  SPF normally requires several text based
      responses imposing high overhead to query various locations.  These
      locations can be constructed by email-address local-part macros which
      can flood caches or leverage DNS name compression to further increase
      network DDoS amplifications when receivers' attempt to verify message
      sources which may then only offer authorization, not authentication
      of accountable domains.  Most email abuse, including what might be
      imposed by SPF, is prevented with comprehensive mapping of the
      address space, but such mapping is impractical with IPv6.
      
      An effective authenticated domain name alternative is needed to
      provide a basis for assessing and reacting to abusive behavior.  For
      most high scale protocols, this involves cryptography.

  "RTP payload format for Enhanced Variable Rate Narrowband-Wideband plus
  2kbps Codec (EVRC-NW2K)", Alok Gupta, 2013-05-02,
  <draft-agupta-payload-rtp-evrc-nw2k-00.txt>

      This document specifies real-time transport protocol (RTP) payload
      formats to be used for the Enhanced Variable Rate Narrowband-Wideband
      plus 2kbps Codec (EVRC-NW2K).  Three media type registrations are
      included for EVRC-NW2K RTP payload formats.  In addition, a file
      format is specified for transport of EVRC-NW2K speech data in storage
      mode applications such as e-mail.

  "Plan B: a proposal for signaling multiple media sources in WebRTC.",
  Justin Uberti, 2013-05-02, <draft-uberti-rtcweb-plan-00.txt>

      This document explains how multiple media sources can be signaled in
      WebRTC using SDP, in a fashion that avoids many common problems and
      provides a simple control surface to the receiver.

  "HTTP Signatures", Mark Cavage, Manu Sporny, 2013-05-04,
  <draft-cavage-http-signatures-00.txt>

      This document describes a way to add origin authentication, message
      integrity, and replay resistance to HTTP requests.  It is intended to
      be used over the HTTPS protocol.

  "Session Initiation Protocol Instance ID usage by the Open Mobile
  Alliance Push-to-talk over Cellular", Andrew Allen, 2013-05-06,
  <draft-allen-dispatch-poc-instanceid-usage-00.txt>

      This document describes how SIP Instance ID as defined in RFC 5626
      [1] is used by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), for Push-to-talk over
      Cellular (PoC) and addresses security concerns with use of the SIP
      instance ID in non-register requests.

  "TRILL OAM MIB", Deepak Kumar, Samer Salam, Tissa Senevirathne,
  2013-05-07, <draft-deepak-trill-oam-mib-00.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols. In particular it defines
      the IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) OAM
      objects.

  "Using SDP with Large Numbers of Media Flows", Adam Roach, Martin
  Thomson, 2013-05-07, <draft-roach-rtcweb-plan-a-00.txt>

      A recurrent theme in WebRTC has been the need to handle very large
      numbers of media flows.  Unfortunately, naive uses of SDP do not
      handle this case particularly well.  This document describes a modest
      set of extensions to SDP which allow it to cleanly handle arbitrary
      numbers of flows while still retaining a large degree of backward
      compatibility with existing and non-RTCWEB endpoints.

  "An Approach for Adding RTCWEB Media Streams without Glare", Adam Roach,
  2013-05-07, <draft-roach-rtcweb-glareless-add-00.txt>

      One of the ongoing challenges in dealing with the massive number of
      streams that RTCWEB implementations may wish to instantiate and
      manipulate is the ability to add and remove streams in a way that
      avoids the condition known as "glare."  This document describes a
      non-normative set of behaviors that RTCWEB implementations can
      implement to completely avoid inducing a glare condition.

  "Supporting Authentication Trailer for OSPFv3", Manav Bhatia, Vishwas
  Manral, Acee Lindem, 2013-06-23, <draft-acee-ospf-rfc6506bis-03.txt>

      Currently, OSPF for IPv6 (OSPFv3) uses IPsec as the only mechanism
      for authenticating protocol packets.  This behavior is different from
      authentication mechanisms present in other routing protocols (OSPFv2,
      Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS), RIP, and Routing
      Information Protocol Next Generation (RIPng)).  In some environments,
      it has been found that IPsec is difficult to configure and maintain
      and thus cannot be used.  This document defines an alternative
      mechanism to authenticate OSPFv3 protocol packets so that OSPFv3 does
      not only depend upon IPsec for authentication.  This document
      obsoletes RFC 6506.

  "Username Interoperability", Peter Saint-Andre, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-saintandre-username-interop-01.txt>

      Various Internet protocols define constructs for usernames, i.e., the
      local part of an address such as "localpart@example.com".  This
      document describes a subset of characters to allow in usernames for
      maximal interoperability across Internet protocols.  The subset might
      prove useful in cases where a provider offers multiple services using
      the same underlying identifier.

  "Address Autoconfiguration for RPL", Wan-Ting Zhu, 2013-05-10,
  <draft-zhu-roll-addr-autoconf-00.txt>

      This document presents a straightforward address
      autoconfiguration mechanism for RPL over low power and lossy
      networks (LLN). A solution is proposed to add the capability
      of reusable address allocation. In this solution, nodes are
      assigned with unique IPv6 addresses according to their positions
      in the network. The amount of routing entries kept at each node
      is reduced. Also, this document introduces a dynamic adjustment
      strategy for adapting to uneven distribution of node density.

  "The WebRTC Data Channel as a Transport for the Message Session Relay
  Protocol (MSRP)", Peter Dunkley, Gavin Llewellyn, 2013-05-10,
  <draft-pd-msrp-webrtc-00.txt>

      The WebRTC Data Channel enables two-way real-time communication
      between browsers.  This document updates normatively updates RFC 4975
      to add support for WebRTC Data Channel as a transport for MSRP
      (Message Session Relay Protocol).  This will enable secure, low-
      latency, structured peer-to-peer messaging between WebRTC end-points.

  "Netconf surprises", Tom Petch, 2013-05-10,
  <draft-petch-netconf-surprises-00.txt>

      This document identifies some aspects of Netconf that may come as a
      suprise to those familiar with the use of SNMP for device management.

  "Disable "Proxy ARP for Everything" on IPv4 link-local in the presence
  of IPv6 global address", Andrew Yourtchenko, Owen, 2013-05-10,
  <draft-yourtchenko-ipv6-disable-ipv4-proxyarp-00.txt>

      rfc3927 defines the behavior "Proxy ARP for Everything" in case the
      only address present on the host is IPv4 link-local.  However, it
      does not specify anything about the presence or absence of IPv6
      global addressing.  This results in the hosts assuming it has both
      IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity in the scenario where the host itself is
      dualstack-enabled, but the network supplies only IPv6 configuration
      information.  Some implementations in this case may decide to use
      IPv4, which results in long connection delays.  This document
      proposes to avoid the "Proxy ARP for Everything" behavior if the host
      has been assigned an IPv6 address.

  "Power Based Topologies in OSPF using LDP for label exchanges", Shankar
  Raman, Balaji Venkat, Gaurav Raina, Vasan Srini, 2013-05-10,
  <draft-mjsraman-rtgwg-ospf-ldp-power-topo-00.txt>

      In this specification OSPF shortest path first computation is done
      based on power ratios (consumed-power to available-bandwidth OR
      available-bandwidth to available-bandwidth) assigned to links and
      nodes such as Broadcast-Multi-Access networks that form part of the
      topology in an area. When MPLS is deployed in the area (be it the
      backbone or non-backbone area) LDP can be used to distribute a
      disjoint set of labels for the power based topology. Flows some or
      all of those that traverse the area can then be mapped either to the
      regular shortest-path tree or the power based shortest-path tree.
      This document specifies the proposal to construct and maintain such a
      tree called the power based SPT.

  "DKIM is Harmful as Specified", Douglas Otis, David Rand, 2013-06-17,
  <draft-otis-dkim-harmful-03.txt>

      Currently, email lacks conventions ensuring SMTP clients can be
      identified by an authenticated domain.  Unfortunately many hope to
      use DKIM as an alternative, but it is independent of intended
      recipients and domains accountable for having sent the message.  This
      means DKIM is poorly suited at establishing abuse assessments of
      unsolicited commercial email otherwise known as SPAM, nor was this
      initially DKIM's intent.  DKIM lacks message context essential to
      ensure fair assessment and to ensure this assessment is not poisoned
      (Who initiated the transaction and to whom).
      
      DKIM was instead intended to establish increased levels of trust
      based upon valid DKIM signatures controlling acceptance and what a
      user sees within the FROM header field.  But DKIM failed to guard
      against pre-pended header fields where any acceptance based on valid
      DKIM signatures is sure to exclude header field spoofing, especially
      that of the FROM.  This weakness allows malefactors to exploit DKIM
      signature acceptance established by high-volume DKIM domains to spoof
      ANY other domain, even when prohibited within the Signer's network.

  "Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) Extensions for Websocket
  Allocations", Chen Xin, 2013-05-13,
  <draft-chenxin-behave-turn-websocket-00.txt,.pdf>

      This document defines an extension to TURN that allows it to run over
      a Websocket [RFC6455] channel.  This will allow a client in a
      restrictive network to exchange and relay media or data over the
      websocket.

  "IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE Operation or Quick Flag Changes
  Resynchronization", Alexey Melnikov, 2013-05-14,
  <draft-melnikov-rfc4551-bis-00.txt>

      Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate changes to
      a common IMAP mailbox.  Examples include different clients working on
      behalf of the same user, and multiple users accessing shared
      mailboxes.  These clients need a mechanism to synchronize state
      changes for messages within the mailbox.  They must be able to
      guarantee that only one client can change message state (e.g.,
      message flags) at any time.  An example of such an application is use
      of an IMAP mailbox as a message queue with multiple dequeueing
      clients.
      
      The Conditional Store facility provides a protected update mechanism
      for message state information that can detect and resolve conflicts
      between multiple writing mail clients.
      
      The Conditional Store facility also allows a client to quickly
      resynchronize mailbox flag changes.
      
      This document defines an extension to IMAP (RFC 3501).

  "BGP Extension for MVPN Site-Type Attribute", Pradeep Jain, Geetha
  RemaDevi, Jayant Kotalwar, Girish Birajdar, Jeffrey Zhang, 2013-05-15,
  <draft-jain-mvpn-bgp-sitetype-attribute-00.txt>

      This document defines a new BGP attribute in BGP based multicast VPN,
      that allows a MVPN PE router to inform the rest of MVPN PE routers
      whether it is a sender site/receiver site and there by avoid all
      other PEs from setting up P-tunnels to the sender site PE.  This
      would reduce control plane states in the network and allow efficient
      network bandwidth utilization .

  "Last Autonomous System (AS) Reservations", Jeffrey Haas, Jon Mitchell,
  2013-05-16, <draft-jhjm-idr-last-as-reservations-00.txt>

      This document reserves two Autonomous System numbers (ASNs) at the
      end of the 16 bit and 32 bit ranges, described in this document as
      "Last ASNs" and recommends they not be used by operators.

  "Web Conference Recording Use Case", Paul Kyzivat, Michael Yan,
  2013-05-16, <draft-kyzivat-siprec-webconf-use-case-00.txt>

      The current work of SIPREC will soon finish.  As its charter defined,
      SIPREC has covered industries like financial trading floors, contact
      center and emergency service bureaus.  But when talking about
      products or solutions like data or web conferencing, SIPREC is
      insufficient to record all aspects of calls with different
      interactive media channels.  This draft tries to show a use case for
      web conference recording and show how it can work well under SIPREC
      mechanism.

  "Macros Nixed by Major Providers", Douglas Otis, David Rand, 2013-05-28,
  <draft-otis-spfbis-macros-nixed-01.txt>

      SPF is a popular tool for managing email blocking issues.  It has
      also helped reduce backscatter related with Non-Delivery
      Notifications as was intended.  A practically unused feature is the
      SPF macro capability that SPFbis still in part retains.  This feature
      greatly diminishes SPF's utility and actually threatens email
      interchange, especially when used in conjunction with secondary
      policy layers when also ignored by major providers.  The macro
      mechanism is also unable to cope with internationalization, and is
      found in virtually none of the published resource records.  It is
      counter productive to retain the largely unused and often unsupported
      macro feature, despite efforts expended to develop the macro
      language.

  "JSON Service Connect (JCX) Protocol", Phillip Hallam-Baker, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-hallambaker-wsconnect-04.txt,.pdf>

      JSON Service Connect (JCX) is a JSON/REST Web Service that may be
      used to establish and maintain a 'connection binding' of a device to
      an account held with a Web Service Provider.  Multiple connection
      bindings may be established under the same account to support
      multiple devices and/or multiple users of a single device.  A
      connection binding permits a device to securely connect to one or
      more services offered by the Web Service Provider with support for
      protocol and protocol version agilty and fault tollerance.
      
      The protocol is presented as a HTTP/JSON Web Service and uses the
      HTTP session continuation mechanism for authentication of transaction
      messages and supports negotiation of a HTTP session continuation
      mechanism context for the established endpoint connections.

  "SMTP security via opportunistic DANE TLS", Viktor Dukhovni, Wesley
  Hardaker, 2013-07-15, <draft-dukhovni-smtp-opportunistic-tls-01.txt>

      This memo describes a protocol for opportunistic TLS security based
      on the DANE TLSA DNS record.  The design goal is an incremental
      transition of the Internet email backbone (MTA to MTA SMTP traffic)
      from today's unauthenticated and unencrypted connections to TLS
      encrypted and authenticated delivery when the client is DANE TLSA
      aware and the server domain publishes DANE TLSA records for its MX
      hosts.

  "DANE TLSA implementation and operational guidance", Viktor Dukhovni,
  Wesley Hardaker, 2013-07-15, <draft-dukhovni-dane-ops-01.txt>

      This memo provides operational guidance to server operators to help
      ensure that clients will be able to authenticate a server's
      certificate chain via published TLSA records.  Guidance is also
      provided to clients for selecting reliable TLSA record parameters to
      use for server authentication.  Finally, guidance is given to
      protocol designers who wish to make use of TLSA records to secure
      protocols using a TLS and TLSA combination.

  "HTTP/2.0 Discussion: Extension Frame Types", James Snell, 2013-05-20,
  <draft-snell-httpbis-ext-frames-00.txt>

      This memo describes the structure and use cases for a handful of
      "extension" frames types for HTTP 2.0.  The purpose of this document
      is to add to the overall discussion around the development of HTTP
      2.0 by describing ways in which the framing layer can be leveraged
      and extended.

  "A Common Operational Problem in DNS Servers - Failure To Respond.",
  Mark Andrews, 2013-05-21, <draft-andrews-dns-no-response-issue-01.txt>

      The DNS is a query / response protocol.  Failure to respond to
      queries causes both immediate operational problems and long term
      problems with protocol development.
      
      This document will identify a number of common classes of queries
      that some servers fail to respond too.  This document will also
      suggest procedures for TLD and other similar zone operators to apply
      to reduce / eliminate the problem.

  "GOST R 34.10-2012: Digital Signature Algorithm", Vasily Dolmatov,
  Alexey Degtyarev, 2013-05-21, <draft-dolmatov-gost34102012-00.txt>

      This document is intended to be a source of information about the
      Russian Federal standard for digital signatures (GOST R 34.10-2012),
      which is one of the Russian cryptographic standard algorithms (called
      GOST algorithms).  Recently, Russian cryptography is being used in
      Internet applications, and this document has been created as
      information for developers and users of GOST R 34.10-2012 for digital
      signature generation and verification.

  "The application/cms media type", Sean Turner, Russ Housley, Jim Schaad,
  2013-06-21, <draft-turner-application-cms-media-type-05.txt>

      This document registers the application/cms media types for use with
      the corresponding CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) content types.

  "Schnorr Signature: Non-interactive Zero Knowledge Proof for Discrete
  Logarithm", Feng Hao, 2013-05-21, <draft-hao-schnorr-00.txt>

      This document describes the Schnorr signature, a non-interactive
      variant of the three-pass Schnorr identification scheme.  The Schnorr
      signature allows one to prove the knowledge of a discrete logarithm
      without leaking its value.  It can serve as a useful building block
      for many cryptographic protocols to ensure the participants follow
      the protocol specification honestly.

  "J-PAKE: Password Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling", Feng Hao,
  2013-05-21, <draft-hao-jpake-00.txt>

      This document specifies a Password Authenticated Key Exchange by
      Juggling (J-PAKE) protocol.  This protocol allows the establishment
      of a secure end-to-end communication channel between two remote
      parties over an insecure network solely based on a shared password,
      without requiring a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or any trusted
      third party.

  "IPv6 Multicast Address Scopes", Ralph Droms, 2013-07-30,

  "Recommended Usages of SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256", Tim Polk, Sean Turner,
  2013-05-23, <draft-dang-turner-sha-512-224-256-00.txt>

      This document provides recommendations on the use of the secure hash
      functions SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 specified in FIPS 180. SHA-
      512/224 and SHA-512/256 are SHA-512-based and truncated to match the
      output size of SHA-224 and SHA-256. On 64-bit platforms, the SHA-512-
      truncated algorithms provide better performance than their comparably
      sized SHA-224 and SHA-256 variants.

  "Dynamic RP encodings in BGP based MVPNs", Pavan Kurapati, Marco
  Rodrigues, Kurt Windisch, Saud Asif, 2013-05-23,
  <draft-kurapati-dynamicrp-bgpmvpn-00.txt>

      PIM Group-to-RP mappings are distributed dynamically using protocols
      such as BSR or Auto-RP.  The BGP-MVPN specification provides for this
      information to be encapsulated in an I-PMSI or S-PMSI provider tunnel
      between the PEs in an MVPN environment.  Since this is control
      information, it is desirable to signal this information in BGP
      between PEs, similar to carrying other customer control state such as
      C-Multicast routes.  This document specifies the mechanisms and
      procedures to carry bootstrap information via BGP to provide true
      control and data plane separation.

  "Trust Router Problem Statement", Jim Schaad, 2013-05-30,
  <draft-schaad-trust-router-problem-01.txt>

      There are a number of problems with using the current AAA framework
      for doing access control, this document looks at a number of these
      issues and poses some questions about how to create a new trust
      router system.

  Wim Henderickx, 2013-05-24, <draft-singh-nvo3-vxlan-router-alert-00.txt>

      This proposal describes a new option to achieve a mechanism which
      alerts VxLAN terminating VTEP to more closely examine the contents of
      the packet encapsulated under VxLAN header.  This option is useful
      for case(s) where a given frame encapsulated within a given VXLAN
      segment responsible for carrying data between two different End
      Systems contains some control information (e.g OAM information) that
      may require special handling/processing by terminating VTEP.

  Wim Henderickx, 2013-05-24, <draft-singh-nvo3-nvgre-router-alert-00.txt>

      This proposal describes a new option to achieve a mechanism which
      alerts NVGRE egress End Point to more closely examine the contents of
      the packet encapsulated under NVGRE header.  This option is useful
      for case(s) where a given frame encapsulated within a given NVGRE
      segment responsible for carrying data between two different End
      Systems contains some control information (e.g OAM information) that
      may require special handling/processing at NVGRE egress End Point.

  "PCP Extension for Third Party Authorization", Dan Wing, Tirumaleswar
  Reddy, Prashanth Patil, Reinaldo Penno, 2013-05-24,
  <draft-wing-pcp-third-party-authz-00.txt>

      It is often desirable for an application server to permit a flow
      across a firewall, as happens today when a firewall includes an
      Application Layer Gateway (ALG) function.  However, an ALG has
      several weaknesses.
      
      This document describes a cryptographic technique for an application
      server to permit a flow across a firewall.  This technique uses OAuth
      and a new PCP option.

  "PCP Considerations for WebRTC Usage", Reinaldo Penno, Tirumaleswar
  Reddy, Dan Wing, Mohamed Boucadair, 2013-05-24,

      This document describes the motivations for WebRTC applications to be
      PCP-aware and the benefits provided by PCP-capable NATs and
      Firewalls.

  "The "property" and "context" Link Relations", Ioseb Dzmanashvili,

  "Secure Origin Identification: Problem Statement, Threat Model,
  Requirements, and Roadmap", Jon Peterson, Henning Schulzrinne, Hannes
  Tschofenig, 2013-07-15, <draft-peterson-secure-origin-ps-01.txt>

      Over the past decade, SIP has become a major signaling protocol for
      voice communications, one which has replaced many traditional
      telephony deployments.  However, interworking SIP with the
      traditional telephone network has ultimately reduced the security of
      Caller ID systems.  Given the widespread interworking of SIP with the
      telephone network, the lack of effective standards for identifying
      the calling party in a SIP session has granted attackers new powers
      as they impersonate or obscure calling party numbers when
      orchestrating bulk commercial calling schemes, hacking voicemail
      boxes or even circumventing multi-factor authentication systems
      trusted by banks.  This document therefore examines the reasons why
      providing identity for telephone numbers on the Internet has proven
      so difficult, and shows how changes in the last decade may provide us
      with new strategies for attaching a secure identity to SIP sessions.

  "P6R's Secure Shell Public Key Subsystem", Mark Joseph, Jim Susoy,
  2013-06-23, <draft-joseph-pkix-p6rsshextension-03.txt>

      The Secure Shell Public Key Subsystem protocol defines a key
      distribution
      protocol to provision an SSH server with user's public
      keys.  However,
      that protocol is limited to provisioning an SSH server.
      This document
      describes a new protocol that builds on the protocol
      defined in RFC 4819
      to allow the provisioning of keys and certificates
      to a server using the
      SSH transport.
      
      The new protocol allows the calling client to organize
      keys and certificates in different namespaces on a server.  These
      namespaces can be used by the server to allow a client to configure
      any application running on the server (e.g., SSH, KMIP, SNMP).
      
      The new protocol provides a server-independent mechanism for clients
      to add public keys, remove public keys, add certificates, remove
      certificates, and list the current set of keys and certificates known by
      the server by namespace (e.g., list all public keys in the SSH
      namespace).
      
      Rights to manage keys and certificates in a specific namespace are
      specific and limited to the authorized user and are defined as part of
      the server's implementation.   The described protocol is backward
      compatible to version 2 defined by RFC 4819.

  "Using UDP Checksum Trailers in the Network Time Protocol (NTP)", Tal
  Mizrahi, 2013-05-28, <draft-mizrahi-ntp-checksum-trailer-00.txt>

      The Network Time Protocol (NTP) allows clients to synchronize to a
      time server using timestamped protocol messages. To faciliate
      accurate timestamping, some implementations use hardware-based
      timestamping engines that integrate the accurate transmission time
      into every outgoing NTP packet during transmission. Since these
      packets are transported over UDP, the UDP checksum field is then
      updated to reflect this modification. This document proposes an
      extension field that includes a 2-octet Checksum Trailer, allowing
      timestamping engines to reflect the checksum modification in the last
      2 octets of the packet rather than in the UDP checksum field. The
      behavior defined in this document is interoperable with existing NTP
      implementations.

  "UDP Checksum Trailer in OWAMP and TWAMP", Tal Mizrahi, 2013-05-28,
  <draft-mizrahi-owamp-twamp-checksum-trailer-00.txt>

      The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and the Two-Way
      Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) are used for performance
      monitoring in IP networks. Delay measurement is performed in these
      protocols by using timestamped test packets. Some implementations use
      hardware-based timestamping engines that integrate the accurate
      transmission timestamp into every outgoing OWAMP/TWAMP test packet
      during transmission.  Since these packets are transported over UDP,
      the UDP checksum field is then updated to reflect this modification.
      This document proposes to use the last 2 octets of every test packet
      as a Checksum Trailer, allowing timestamping engines to reflect the
      checksum modification in the last 2 octets rather than in the UDP
      checksum field. The behavior defined in this document is completely
      interoperable with existing OWAMP/TWAMP implementations.

  "Updates to the PCP specification", Stuart Cheshire, Simon Perreault,
  2013-07-14, <draft-cheshire-pcp-unsupp-family-05.txt>

      The Port Control Protocol (PCP) allows clients to request mappings in
      NAT gateways and firewalls.  This document specifies the PCP
      UNSUPP_FAMILY error code, which enables PCP servers to inform clients
      when the requested external address family is not supported.  This
      document also removes the requirement for the PCP server to validate
      the mapping nonce, which proved to be unhelpful in practice.

  "A Fragmentation Strategy for Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)", Ron
  Bonica, Carlos Pignataro, 2013-06-21,
  <draft-bonica-intarea-gre-mtu-02.txt>

      This memo documents a GRE fragmentation strategy that has been
      implemented by many vendors and deployed in many networks.  It was
      written so that a) implementors will be aware of best common practice
      and b) those who rely on GRE will understand how implementations
      work.  The scope of this memo is limited to point-to-point GRE
      tunnels.  All other tunnel types are beyond the scope of this memo.

  "Connectivity Provisioning Negotiation Protocol (CPNP)", Mohamed

  <draft-boucadair-connectivity-provisioning-protocol-00.txt>

      This document specifies the Connectivity Provisioning Negotiation
      Protocol (CPNP) which is used to facilitate the dynamic negotiation
      of connectivity provisioning parameters between a Customer and a
      Provider.

  "No Plan: Economical Use of the Offer/Answer Model in WebRTC Sessions
  with Multiple Media Sources", Emil Ivov, Enrico Marocco, Peter Thatcher,
  2013-06-17, <draft-ivov-rtcweb-noplan-01.txt>

      This document describes a model for the lightweight use of SDP Offer/
      Answer in WebRTC.  The goal is to minimize reliance on Offer/Answer
      exchanges in a WebRTC session and provide applications with the tools
      necessary to implement the signalling that they may need in a way
      that best fits their custom requirements and topologies.  This
      simplifies signalling of multiple media sources or providing RTP
      Synchronisation source (SSRC) identification in multi-party sessions.
      Another important goal of this model is to remove from clients
      topological constraints such as the requirement to know in advance
      all SSRC identifiers that they could potentially introduce in a
      particular session.
      
      The model described here is similar to the one employed by the data
      channel JavaScript APIs in WebRTC, where methods are supported on
      PeerConnection without being reflected in SDP.
      
      This document does not question the use of SDP and the Offer/Answer
      model or the value they have in terms of interoperability with legacy
      or other non-WebRTC devices.

  "Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP)", Jon Peterson, Cullen Jennings, Eric Rescorla, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-jennings-dispatch-rfc4474bis-01.txt>

      The baseline security mechanisms in the Session Initiation Protocol
      (SIP) are inadequate for cryptographically assuring the identity of
      the end users that originate SIP requests, especially in an
      interdomain context.  This document defines a mechanism for securely
      identifying originators of SIP requests.  It does so by defining new
      SIP header fields for conveying a signature used for validating the
      identity, and for conveying a reference to the credentials of the
      signer.

  "IANA Registries for BGP Extended Communities", Eric Rosen, Yakov
  Rekhter, 2013-05-30, <draft-rosen-idr-extcomm-iana-00.txt>

      This document reorganizes the IANA Registries for the type values and
      sub-type values of BGP Extended Communities attribute and the BGP
      IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Communities attribute.  This is done
      in order to remove inter-dependencies among the registries, thus
      making it easier for IANA to determine which codepoints are available
      for assignment in which registries.  This document also clarifies the
      information that must be provided to IANA when requesting an
      allocation from one or more of these registries.  These changes are
      compatible with the existing allocations, and thus do not affect
      protocol implementations.  The changes will however impact the "IANA
      Considerations" sections of future protocol specifications.  This
      document updates RFCs 4360 and 5701.

  "IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option", Nalini
  Elkins, Michael Ackermann, Keven Haining, Sigfrido Perdomo, William
  Jouris, David Boyes, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-01.txt>

      To diagnose problems for a number of Enterprise Data Center Operators
      (EDCO), two metrics are critical for timely end-to-end problem
      resolution, both real-time and after the fact, without impacting an
      operational production network. They are: packet sequence number and
      packet timestamp. Packet sequence number is required for diagnostics.
      Packet timestamp is required to calculate end-to-end response time.
      Current methods are inadequate for these purposes because they assume
      unreasonable access to intermediate devices, are cost prohibitive,
      require infeasible changes to a running production network, and / or
      do not provide timely data. This document solves these problems with
      a new destination option, the Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
      destination option (PDM).

  "Compression of IPsec AH and ESP Headers for Constrained Environments",
  Shahid Raza, Simon Duquennoy, Goran Selander, 2013-05-31,
  <draft-raza-6lowpan-ipsec-00.txt,.ps,.pdf>

      This document describes the header compression mechanisms for the
      IPsec [RFC4301] based on the encoding scheme standardized in
      [RFC6282]. The IPsec Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulated
      Security Payload (ESP) headers are compressed using Next Header
      Compression (NHC) defined in [RFC6282]. This document does not
      invalidate any encoding schemes proposed in 6LoWPAN [RFC6282] but
      rather complements it with compressed IPsec using the free bits in
      the IPv6 Extension Header encoding.

  "Simple Host Discovery and Configuration Protocol", Dmitry Fedorov,
  2013-06-01, <draft-d1f-shdcp-00.txt>

      The Simple Host Discovery and Configuration Protocol (SHDCP)
      provides a mechanism used when an Internet host with almost no
      configuration has to be discovered and, at the same time,
      configured to some IPv4 network.
      This task can not be accomplished by DHCP.
      Other known protocols are too complicated or proprietary.
      The key feature of the proposed protocol is simplicity.

  "PIE: A Lightweight Control Scheme To Address the Bufferbloat Problem",
  Rong Pan, Preethi Natarajan, Chiara Piglione, Mythili Prabhu,
  2013-06-03, <draft-pan-aqm-pie-00.txt>

      Bufferbloat is a phenomenon where excess buffers in the network cause
      high latency and jitter. As more and more interactive applications
      (e.g. voice over IP, real time video streaming and financial
      transactions) run in the Internet, high latency and jitter degrade
      application performance. There is a pressing need to design
      intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and
      jitter; and hence provide desirable quality of service to users.
      
      We present here a lightweight design, PIE(Proportional Integral
      controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average
      queueing latency to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical
      analysis and Linux testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low
      latency and achieve high link utilization under various congestion
      situations. The design does not require per-packet timestamp, so it
      incurs very small overhead and is simple enough to implement in both
      hardware and software.

      Type.

  "PIM-DM Optimizations for Large LANs", Joseph Weinstein, Joseph Keller,
  2013-06-04, <draft-weinstein-bbn-pim-dm-large-lan-00.txt>

      Optimizations to the PIM-DM protocol [RFC3973] are proposed that
      dramatically reduce the PIM-DM routing overhead on local area
      networks containing large numbers of PIM routers.  These
      optimizations reduce the likelihood of two or more routers emitting
      redundant JOIN or PRUNE messages onto the same LAN.  While these
      optimizations are of general applicability to large LANs, they were
      motivated in particular by performance requirements for supporting
      PIM-DM across LANs emulated by IP tunneling over large wireless
      MANETs.
      
      PIM-DM routers supporting these optimizations will interoperate with
      standard PIM-DM as defined in RFC 3973, even on the same LAN.
      However, to obtain maximum benefit from these optimizations, all
      PIM-DM routers on the LAN SHOULD support them.

  "Finding the Authoritative Registration Data (RDAP) Server", Marc

  "PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH)", Matthew Miller, Peter Saint-Andre,
  2013-06-04, <draft-miller-posh-00.txt>

      This document defines two methods that make it easier to deploy
      certificates for proper server identity checking in application
      protocols.  The first method enables a TLS client to obtain a TLS
      server's end-entity certificate over secure HTTP as an alternative to
      standard Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) and DNS-Based
      Authentication of Named Entities (DANE).  The second method enables a
      source domain to securely delegate an application to a derived domain
      using HTTPS redirects.

  "Interoperability Impacts of IPv6 Interworking with Existing IPv4 SIP
  Implementations", Carl Klatsky, oej, Rifaat Shekh-Yusef, Andrew Hutton,
  Gonzalo Salgueiro, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-klatsky-dispatch-ipv6-impact-ipv4-01.txt>

      This document captures potential impacts to IPv4 SIP implementations
      when interworking with IPv6 SIP implementations.  Although some
      amount of interworking translation will occur at the network and
      application layers, an IPv4 SIP application may still encounter a SIP
      message with some IPv6 values in it, resulting in unforeseen error
      conditions.  Such potential scenarios will be identified in this
      document so that SIP application developers can define solutions to
      handle these cases.  Note, this document is not intended to be an
      exhaustive list, rather to provide an overview of some of the more
      commonly encountered potential scenarios.

  "Diameter Overload Control Solution Issues", Ben Campbell, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-campbell-dime-overload-issues-01.txt>

      The Diameter Maintenance and Extensions (DIME) working group has
      undertaken an "overload control" work item, with the goal of
      standardizing a mechanism to allow Diameter nodes to report overload
      information among themselves.  Requirements currently include, among
      others, the need to accurately report the scope of overload
      conditions, and the ability to report overload information between
      nodes that are not directly connected at the transport layer.  These
      requirements introduce complex issues.  This document describes those
      issues, in the hope that it will assist the working group's decision
      process.

  "Side effect of DNSSEC: an increase of DS queries", Kazunori Fujiwara,
  2013-07-15, <draft-fujiwara-dnsop-ds-query-increase-01.txt>

      An increase of periodic DS queries is observed at top level domain
      (TLD) DNS servers.  Almost all of periodic DS queries are queries for
      unsigned delegations.  The reason of the increase is low NCACHE TTL
      value and DS nonexistence.  This phenomena is DNSSEC protocol and DNS
      parameter issue.  DS queries will increase as DNSSEC validators will
      increase.

  "Programmatic Interfaces to On-demand Network Services", Masum Hasan,
  Abdelhadi Chari, David Fahed, Monique Morrow, 2013-06-07,
  <draft-masum-chari-i2rs-netservices-00.txt>

      One of the major features or requirements of Cloud is on-demand CRUD
      (Create / Read / Update / Delete) of Cloud resources or associated
      resources.  The on-demand feature dictates that resources are CRUD in
      a time-frame in the order of seconds or few minutes since the arrival
      of the resource CRUD request.  Many network resources cannot be CRUD
      in that time-frame.  With the support of programmable networking (or
      SDN) in the model of I2RS will facilitate programming of network
      resources rapidly, thus facilitating CRUD of Cloud or related network
      resources on-demand.  Network resources associated with many network
      services can be either a Cloud resource or directly associated with a
      Cloud resource.  These resources should be CRUD on-demand in Cloud
      timescale.  In this draft, employing Hybrid (virtual) Cloud as a use
      case and using I2RS as the "model", we will define few requirements
      for programmable on-demand interfaces to network services or I2NS.

  "Publishing Organization Boundaries in the DNS", John Levine,
  2013-07-31, <draft-levine-orgboundary-02.txt>

      Often, the organization that manages a subtree in the DNS is
      different from the one that manages the tree above it.  Rather than
      describing a particular design, we describe an architecture to
      publish in the DNS the boundaries between organizations that can be
      adapted to various policy models.

  "CoAP High-Level State Option Extension", Richard Mietz, 2013-06-09,
  <draft-mietz-core-coap-state-option-00.txt>

      CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained devices which
      are often equipped with sensors measuring a physical phenomenon such
      as temperature on a precise scale.  These sensor values are made
      available by a resource on the CoAP endpoint.  However, for many
      applications it is not necessary to have the full precision a sensor
      can provide.  It's often even enough to only have some high-level
      states instead of raw values.  This document presents a new option
      for CoAP to dynamically create new resources for a sensor which
      provides user-defined high-level states instead of raw sensor values.

  "Binary Encodings for JavaScript Object Notation: JSON-B, JSON-C,
  JSON-D", Phillip Hallam-Baker, 2013-06-10,
  <draft-hallambaker-jsonbcd-00.txt,.pdf>

      Three binary encodings for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) are
      presented.  JSON-B (Binary) is a strict superset of the JSON encoding
      that permits efficient binary encoding of intrinsic JavaScript data
      types.  JSON-C (Compact) is a strict superset of JSON-B that supports
      compact representation of repeated data strings with short numeric
      codes.  JSON-D (Data) supports additional binary data types for
      integer and floating point representations for use in scientific
      applications where conversion between binary and decimal
      representations would cause a loss of precision.

  "Profiling of DTLS for CoAP-based IoT Applications", Sye Keoh, Sandeep
  Kumar, Zach Shelby, 2013-06-12, <draft-keoh-dtls-profile-iot-00.txt>

      This document collects various implementation challenges of DTLS on
      embedded systems, and proposes a profile of DTLS for CoAP-based
      Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Specifically, this document
      investigates the application features and functionality of DTLS
      protocol, the fragmentation issue of DTLS Handshake protocol, and the
      complexity of the DTLS Handshake state machine. A RESTful DTLS
      Handshake which relies on CoAP Block-wise Transfer is proposed to
      address the fragmentation issue. The next step is to define a DTLS
      profile for embedded systems.

  <draft-quinn-nsc-problem-statement-02.txt>

      This document provides an overview of the issues associated with the
      deployment of network services functions (such as firewalls, load
      balancers) in large-scale environments.  The term service chaining is
      used to describe the deployment of such services, and the ability of
      a network operator to specify an ordered list of services that should
      be applied to a deterministic set of traffic flows.  Such service
      chains require integration of service policy alongside the deployment
      of applications, while allowing for the optimal utilization of
      network resources.

      disambiguate the conflict.
      
      I am publishing this to maybe establish prior art, but not to have
      anyone implement it.

  "Differentiated Network-Located Function Chaining Framework", Mohamed
  Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet, Ron Parker, Diego Lopez, Parviz Yegani,
  Jim Guichard, Paul Quinn, 2013-07-03,
  <draft-boucadair-network-function-chaining-02.txt>

      IP networks rely more and more on the combination of advanced
      functions (besides the basic routing and forwarding functions).  This
      document defines a solution to enforce Network-Located Function
      Chaining (NLFC) with minimum requirements on the underlying network.
      
      The proposed solution allows for Differentiated Forwarding
      (DiffForward): packets are classified at the entry point of an NLFC-
      enabled network, and are then forwarded on a per NLFC map basis.

  "A Trust Model for ABFAB Trust Routers", David Chadwick, 2013-06-17,
  <draft-dwc-abfab-trust-model-00.txt>

      Trust routers form an integral part of the ABFAB infrastructure for
      determining routes between IdPs and RPs and determining CoI membership.
      Since it is inherent in their name that they are to be trusted, this
      Internet Draft specifies a trust model for their operation, so that IdPs
      and RPs can rely on them to perform the tasks that they are trusted to
      perform. These tasks are:
      
      -	form a trusted route between an IdP and RP
      -	ensure that a community of interest (CoI)only has the members that it
      should have

  "Multi-homed network in EVPN", Hao Weiguo, Li Yizhou, Pei Xu,
  2013-06-17, <draft-hao-l2vpn-evpn-mhn-00.txt>

      To enhance the reliability, bridged network is normally multi-homed
      to an EVPN network, there are two categories of mechanisms to avoid
      the layer 2 traffic loop. The first category does not require the PEs
      participating in the control protocol of the bridged network, while
      the second category requires that. [EVPN] described one of the first
      category mechanisms called  designated forwarder (DF) election to
      achieve loop avoidance and vlan-based load balancing. This draft
      mainly focuses on the second category of mechanisms which can achieve
      intra-vlan MAC-based load balancing. MAC-based VLAN balancing is more
      applicable than DF election mechanism if all end stations in bridged
      network are on the same VLAN which can cause traffic congestion in DF
      link.

  "Interface Selection Mechanism for Multiple Interfaces IPv6 Hosts",
  Arnaud Kaiser, Alexandru Petrescu, 2013-06-18,
  <draft-kaiser-if-sel-00.txt>

      This document describes an interface selection mechanism that enables
      multiple interfaces (multihomed) IPv6 hosts to select their most
      appropriate egress interface to send data over the network.  The
      mechanism extends the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol [RFC4861] with
      two new Router Advertisement options.

  "Minimal 6TSCH Configuration", Xavier Vilajosana, Kris Pister,
  2013-07-13, <draft-vilajosana-6tsch-basic-01.txt>

      This document describes the minimal set of rules to operate a
      [IEEE802154e] Timeslotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) network.  These
      rules can be used during early interoperability testing and
      development, when the centralized and distributed solutions developed
      by the 6TSCH group are not fully implemented yet, or otherwise not
      available.

  "PCEP Extensions for Segment Routing", Siva Sivabalan, Jan Medved,
  Clarence Filsfils, Edward Crabbe, Robert Raszuk, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-sivabalan-pce-segment-routing-01.txt>

      Segment Routing (SR) enables any head-end node to select any path
      without relying on a hop-by-hop signaling technique (e.g., LDP or
      RSVP-TE).  It depends only on "segments" that are advertised by Link-
      State Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs).  A Segment Routed Path can
      be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest
      Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration, or a Path Computation
      Element (PCE).  This document specifies extensions to the Path
      Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to
      compute and instantiate Traffic Engineering paths, as well as a PCC
      to request a path subject to certain constraint(s) and optimization
      criteria in SR networks.

  "UDP Transport Layer (UDPTL) over Datagram Transport Layer Security
  (DTLS)", Christer Holmberg, Ivo Sedlacek, 2013-06-20,
  <draft-holmberg-dispatch-udptl-dtls-00.txt>

      This document specifies how the UDP Transport Layer (UDPTL) protocol
      can be transported over the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
      protocol, how the usage of UDPTL over DTLS is indicated in the
      Session Description Protocol (SDP), and how UDPTL over DTLS is
      negotiated in a session established using the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP).

  "The file URI Scheme", Matthew Kerwin, 2013-06-20,
  <draft-kerwinm-file-scheme-00.txt>

      This document specifies the file Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
      scheme that was originally specified in [RFC1738]. The purpose of
      this document is to keep the information about the scheme on
      standards track, since [RFC1738] has been made obsolete.

  "The 'file' URI Scheme", Matthew Kerwin, 2013-07-28,
  <draft-kerwin-file-scheme-06.txt>

      This document specifies the file Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
      scheme that was originally specified in [RFC1738].  The purpose of
      this document is to keep the information about the scheme on
      standards track, since [RFC1738] has been made obsolete, and to
      promote interoperability by resolving disagreements between various
      implementations.
      
      Note to Readers
      
      This draft should be discussed on its github project page [github].

  "Certificate based keying scheme for DTLS secured IoT", Pawani
  Porambage, Pradeep Kumar, Andrei Gurtov, Mika Ylianttila, Erkki Harjula,
  2013-06-23, <draft-pporamba-dtls-certkey-00.txt,.pdf>

      The IP-based Internet of Things (IoT) stands for the universal
      interconnection of smart objects and back end users with the help of
      IP protocols.  Secure key management among the smart objects is an
      important aspect of IoT security.  Due to the high levels of resource
      constraints of the devices in terms of memory, battery capacity and
      CPU power, and other network characteristics such as mobility,
      scalability, heterogeneity and limited bandwidth, the conventional
      security protocols cannot be directly deployed in IoT networks in
      their raw formats.  We propose a lightweight DTLS-based keying
      mechanism for CoAP IoT smart objects which supports the scalability
      of the network and node mobility.  The protocol consumes less device
      resources and minimum network bandwidth by incurring low message
      overhead.  The smart objects can securely access the network and
      obtain certificates after an initial configuration irrespective of
      the manufacturer standards.

  "Security Framework and Key Management Protocol Requirements for 6TSCH",
  Stephen Chasko, Subir Das, Rafael Lopez, Yoshihiro Ohba, Pascal Thubert,
  Alper Yegin, 2013-07-12, <draft-ohba-6tsch-security-01.txt>

      Since 6TSCH forms layer 3 meshes over IPv6, use of key management
      protocols defined at layer 3 or above matches the target architecture
      so they can apply for the process by a new device of joining the mesh
      to extend it.  This document details that particular operation within
      the whole 6TSCH architecture.

  "Group Authentication", Judy Zhu, Minpeng Qi, Ye Tian, 2013-06-23,
  <draft-zhu-core-groupauth-00.txt>

      The group communication is designed for the communication of Internet
      of Things. A threat is identified in [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm] that
      current DTLS based approach is unicast oriented and there is no
      supporting on group authentication feature. Unicast oriented
      authentication will causing serious burden when a large number of
      terminal nodes will be involved inevitably. In another aspect, some
      terminals will own the same characteristics, such as owning same
      features, in the same place, working in the same time, etc. With this
      mechanism, all terminals can be authenticated together with little
      signaling and calculation at the same time. It will reduce the
      network burden and save time. This draft describes the security of
      group authentication and an group authentication implementation
      method for the Internet of things.

  "Locating Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers in a Dual-Stack IP
  Network", oej, Gonzalo Salgueiro, 2013-07-30,
  <draft-johansson-sip-dual-stack-01.txt>

      RFC 3263 defines how a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
      implementation, given a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), should
      locate the next hop SIP server using Domain Name System (DNS)
      procedures.  The specification repeatedly states that the
      implementation should look up IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  This is not a
      suitable solution and one that can cause severely degraded user
      experience dual-stack clients, as detailed in the Happy Eyeballs
      specification.  This document specifies amended procedures for dual-
      stack SIP implementations so that they look up both IPv4 and IPv6
      addresses.  This way, the SIP implementation can find the preferred
      network path and protocol with an improved chance of successfully
      reaching the desired service.  This document also clarifies DNS SRV
      usage for single-stack clients.

  "The Extended LDAP Data Interchange Format (EXLDIF)", Christian
  Hollstein, 2013-06-24, <draft-hollstein-extended-ldif-00.txt>

      LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) has been specified in [RFC2849].
      It covers the LDAP operations ADD, MODIFY, DELETE and MODDN.
      This document specifies how other LDAP operations can be represented
      in a text file. Implementations may take such text files to send
      appropriate LDAP requests to a server and process the responses. This
      work was inspired by the need for a general configurable LDAP client
      used in functional and stress testing of LDAP servers.

  "LDAP Queue Length Control", Christian Hollstein, 2013-06-24,
  <draft-hollstein-queuelength-control-00.txt>

      This document specifies a new control. The client can use it to tell
      the server the number of responses it expects for a series of
      requests that were sent in asynchronous mode. This enables the
      server to better pack usually small LDAP result messages into send
      buffers that better match the TCP maximum transfer unit. From this
      a substantial improvement in network ressource utilization, response
      time and throughput is expected.

  "The Embedded LDAP Data Interchange Format (EMLDIF)", Christian
  Hollstein, 2013-06-24, <draft-hollstein-embedded-ldif-00.txt>

      [RFC2849] and [EXLDIF] specify how LDAP operations can be
      represented in a text file. Client implementations may use this
      data to send sequences of requests to a LDAP server. This document
      specifies how values from the server's response can be propagated,
      displayed and used for decision taking in procedural logic. It
      enables EXLDIF with algorithmic behavior. The general method is to
      use EXLDIF embedded in a high level programming language like C/C++,
      Java and others.

  "The Embedded LDAP Data Interchange Format for C (EMLDIF-C)", Christian
  Hollstein, 2013-06-24, <draft-hollstein-embedded-ldif-c-00.txt>

      [EMLDIF] specifies how LDAP operations can be encoded in EXLDIF and
      embedded in high level programming languages. [EMLDIF] is is the
      common basis for language - dependant specifications. This document
      specifies Embedded LDIF for the programming language C. In order to
      make EMLDIF-C source files interoperable across vendor specific
      implementations the specification goes into detail about data
      structures and API.

  "Extending Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) protocol for use in
  constrained networks", Nouha Oualha, Mounir Kellil, Christophe
  Janneteau, 2013-06-24, <draft-oualha-mikey-ext-00.txt>

      The Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) protocol is a key management
      standard defined in RFC 3830 for streaming and real-time
      applications. In these applications, the MIKEY protocol may be used
      to provide group key management. With the base protocol, the change
      of one group member triggers the unicast transmission of a new group
      key to all members. In the context of an application delivering
      multicast streams to end-users located at multiple capillary
      networks, the key update messages may scale in proportion to the
      number of nodes; thus creating a substantial overhead. This I-D
      proposes an extension to the MIKEY protocol allowing the management
      of the group as a set of clusters, but with fewer changes to the RFC
      3830 standard. Clustering helps in reducing the communication
      overhead produced during key update by using unicast mode only with
      nodes that belong to clusters where group membership changes

  "A Mechanism for Remote-Triggered DNS Cache Flushes (DNS FLUSH)", Joe
  Abley, 2013-06-24, <draft-jabley-dnsop-dns-flush-00.txt>

      DNS NOTIFY is a mechanism for prompt notification of zone changes
      between DNS authority servers that is usually employed to trigger
      immediate zone transfers.
      
      This document specifies an additional use of DNS NOTIFY to allow DNS
      authority servers to trigger cache flushes on recursive DNS servers.
      Such signalling is authenticated and is intended for use between
      cooperating DNS server operators.

  ""Non Accession to the ITRs Considered Harmful"", Richard Hill,
  2013-06-25, <draft-hill-itr-non-accession-harmful-00.txt>

      One of the treaties administered by the International
      Telecommunications Union is the International Telecommunications
      Regulations (ITRs), whose purpose is to promote the development of
      telecommunication services.  The 1988 version of the ITRs opened the
      way for privatisation, liberalization, and the growth of the Internet
      and mobile networks.  Given the subsequent significant structure and
      technological changes, the ITU membership agreed to meet in 2012 to
      revise the ITRs.  While consensus was found on an overwhelming
      majority of the treaty text, some provisions proved to be
      controversial, leading to a split in the membership and sharp
      criticism of selected provisions.
      
      As a result, some ITU Member States did not sign the treaty.  This
      document analyses that criticism and attempts to place it in context;
      it identifies problems that may arise if states to not accede
      to the treaty, and suggests a way forward, concluding that not
      acceding may have undesirable results for the citizens of
      non-signatory countries and for interoperability in general.

  "Dynamic Allocation of Shared IPv4 Addresses using DHCPv4 over DHCPv6",
  Ian Farrer, 2013-06-25, <draft-farrer-dhc-shared-address-lease-00.txt>

      This memo describes an update to [RFC2131], which enables the dynamic
      leasing of shared IPv4 addresses and layer 4 source ports to DHCPv4
      over DHCPv6 clients [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6].  Shared
      addressing allows a single IPv4 address to be allocated to multiple,
      active clients simulataneously.  Clients sharing the same address are
      then differentiated by unique L4 source ports.

      fulfill the emergency call requirements of carriers.

  "NV03 NVA Gap Analysis", Linda Dunbar, Donald Eastlake, 2013-06-25,
  <draft-dunbar-nvo3-nva-gap-analysis-00.txt>

      This draft briefly describes the TRILL's directory assistance
      components. The intent of the draft is to identify the gaps
      against NVO3's Control Plane requirement. Through the gap
      analysis, the document provides a basis for future works that
      develop solutions for Network Virtualization Authority (NVA).

  "The Nominating Committee Process: Eligibility", S Moonesamy,
  2013-07-30, <draft-moonesamy-nomcom-eligibility-01.txt>

      RFC 3777 specifies the process by which members of the Internet
      Architecture Board, Internet Engineering Steering Group and IETF
      Administrative Oversight Committee are selected, confirmed, and
      recalled.
      
      This document updates RFC 3777 to allow all contributors to the IETF
      Standards Process to be eligible to serve on NomCom and sign a Recall
      petition.

  "WebRTC JavaScript Object API Rationale", Robin Raymond, Erik Lagerway,
  Inaki Castillo, Roman Shpount, 2013-07-06,
  <draft-raymond-rtcweb-webrtc-js-obj-api-rationale-01.txt>

      This document describes the reasons why a JavaScript Object Model
      approach is a far better solution than using SDP [RFC4566] as a
      surface API for interfacing with WebRTC.  The document outlines the
      issues and pitfalls as well as use cases that are difficult (or
      impossible) with SDP with offer / answer [RFC3264], and explains the
      benefits and goals of an alternative JavaScript object model
      approach.

  Using OSPFv3", Markus Stenberg, 2013-06-26,
  <draft-stenberg-homenet-dnssdext-hybrid-proxy-ospf-00.txt>

      This document describes how a proxy functioning between Unicast DNS-
      Based Service Discovery and Multicast DNS can be automatically
      configured using automatically configured routing protocol or some
      other network-level state sharing mechanism.  Zero-configuration
      OSPFv3 is used to describe one concrete way to implement this scheme.

      deployments.

  "BGP vector routing.", Keyur Patel, Robert Raszuk, Burjiz Pithawala, Ali
  Sajassi, Luay Jalil, 2013-06-26,
  <draft-patel-raszuk-bgp-vector-routing-00.txt>

      Network architectures have begun to shift from pure destination based
      routing to service aware routing.  Operator requirements in this
      space include forcing traffic through particular service nodes (e.g.
      firewall, NAT) or segments.  This document proposes an enhancement to
      BGP to accommodate these new requirements.
      
      This document proposes a pure control plane solution which allows
      traffic to be routed via an ordered set of transit points (links,
      nodes, or services) on the way to traffic's destination, with no
      change in the forwarding plane.  This approach is in contrast to
      other proposal in this space which provide similar capabilities via
      modifications to the forwarding plane.

  "Usage and applicability of BGP MPLS based Ethernet VPN", Jorge Rabadan,
  Senad Palislamovic, Wim Henderickx, Florin Balus, Keyur Patel, Ali
  Sajassi, 2013-06-26, <draft-rp-l2vpn-evpn-usage-00.txt>

      This document discusses the usage and applicability of BGP MPLS based
      Ethernet VPN (E-VPN) in a simple and fairly common deployment
      scenario. The different E-VPN procedures will be explained on the
      example scenario, analyzing the benefits and trade-offs of each
      option. Along with [E-VPN], this document is intended to provide a
      simplified guide for the deployment of E-VPN in Service Provider
      networks.

  "An Architecture of Service Chaining", Yuanlong Jiang, Li Hongyu,
  2013-06-27, <draft-jiang-service-chaining-arch-00.txt>

      As network virtualization is opening the gate to much more innovative
      services for service providers, service chaining provides a flexible
      way of service provisioning and facilitates their deployment.
      
      This document provides a general abstract architecture for service
      chaining. It is a flexible and scalable architecture which can
      fulfill requirements of service chaining. Some solutions based on
      this architecture are also discussed with their advantages and
      disadvantages. This architecture can be used as a guideline and also
      a criterion for the design of service chaining.

  "Requirements for Service Chaining", Hongyu Li, 2013-06-27,
  <draft-li-service-chaining-requirements-00.txt>

      Chaining some service processing functions may provide services in a
      flexible way.  Such a method is called service chaining.  This
      document presents a list of general requirements service chaining
      should support.  Solutions of service chaining are not presented in
      this document.

  "Service Chaining Use Cases", Will Liu, Hongyu Li, Oliver Huang, Nicolai
  Leymann, Zhen Cao, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-liu-service-chaining-use-cases-01.txt>

      For some network services, traffic is forwarded through a sequence of
      network functions, which usually have dedicated capabilities other
      than forwarding, e.g. firewall.  Forwarding of traffic along a
      sequence of service processing functions is usually based on service
      characteristics, but not destination addresses.  We call such way of
      forwarding as service chaining.  This memo describes use cases of
      service chaining.

  "IPsec sequence number integrity check value", Jifei Song, Tina Tsou,
  Vishwas Manral, 2013-07-08, <draft-song-ipsecme-seq-icv-01.txt>

      This document specifies an IPsec AH and ESP sequence number
      validation scheme, which is complementary to the existing ICV
      mechanism and anti-replay mechanism of AH and ESP in defense against
      DOS attack.  It is an optional feature negotiable through IKE, for
      this feature to be negotiated, both sender and receiver must
      implement it.  If any party doesn't support it, then this feature
      should be excluded from negotiation.  The rationale for such a scheme
      is discussed first; then requirements and guidelines for design of
      the scheme are laid out.  There can be various ways to implement the
      scheme, some reference designs are discussed to set the base for
      effort of identifying best practice and eventually establishing a
      standard on the subject.

  "Use Case for Large Scale Measurements Used in Data Collection of

  <draft-huang-lmap-data-collection-use-case-00.txt>

      This document augments the use cases of large scale measurement of
      broadband performance (LMAP). It discusses measurements for a common
      platform which works for different usages including troubleshooting,
      performance understanding, quality evaluation and network adjusting.

  "CoAp Management Interfaces", Peter Van der Stok, 2013-06-28,
  <draft-vanderstok-core-comi-00.txt,.pdf>

      The draft describes an interface based on CoAP to manage constrained
      devices.  Access to existing MIBs is included.  The proposed
      integration of CoAP with SNMP reduces the code size by removing an
      important part of the SNMP code.  The draft lists a set of CoMI
      objects that describe the operational settings of the applications on
      the device.  A majority of them is taken over from other drafts to
      provide one uniform CoMI based access.
      
      Note
      
      Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should
      be sent to core@ietf.org.

  "RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block for MPEG2
  Transport Stream (TS) Program Specific Information (PSI) dependent
  Decodability Statistics Metrics reporting", Aibo Wang, Claire Bi, Roni
  Even, Qin Wu, Rachel Huang, 2013-06-30,
  <draft-bi-xrblock-rtcp-xr-psi-dep-decodability-01.txt>

      An MPEG2 Transport Stream (TS) is a standard container format used in
      the transmission and storage of multimedia data.  Unicast/Multicast
      MPEG2 TS over RTP is widely deployed in IPTV systems.  This document
      defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block
      that allows the reporting of MPEG2 TS decodability statistics metrics
      related to transmissions of MPEG2 TS over RTP.  The metrics specified
      in the RTCP XR Block are dependent on Program specific information
      carried in MPEG TS.

  Edward Crabbe, 2013-06-28, <draft-filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing-00.txt>

      Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing and tunneling
      paradigms.  A node steers a packet through a controlled set of
      instructions, called segments, by prepending the packet with an SR
      header.  A segment can represent any instruction, topological or
      service-based.  A segment can have a local semantic to an SR node or
      global within an SR domain.  SR allows to enforce a flow through any
      topological path and service chain while maintaining per-flow state
      only at the ingress node to the SR domain.
      
      The Segment Routing architecture can be directly applied to the MPLS
      dataplane with no change on the forwarding plane.  It requires minor
      extension to the existing link-state routing protocols.  Segment
      Routing can also be applied to IPv6 with a new type of routing
      extension header.

  Filsfils, Ahmed Bashandy, Hannes Gredler, Stephane Litkowski,
  2013-07-12, <draft-previdi-isis-segment-routing-extensions-02.txt>

      Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end
      paths within IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of
      topological sub-paths, called "segments".  These segments are
      advertised by the link-state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF).
      
      This draft describes the necessary IS-IS extensions that need to be
      introduced for Segment Routing.

  "The Session Description Protocol (SDP) Application Token Attribute",
  Roni Even, Jonathan Lennox, Qin Wu, 2013-06-28,
  <draft-even-mmusic-application-token-00.txt>

      The RTP fixed header includes the payload type number and the SSRC
      values of the RTP stream.  RTP defines how you de-multiplex streams
      within an RTP session, but in some use cases applications need
      further identifiers in order to identify the application semantics
      associated with particular streams within the session.
      
      This document defines a mechanism to provide the mapping between the
      SSRCs of RTP streams and the application semantics by defining
      extensions to RTP and RTCP messages.

  "AS112 Redirection using DNAME", Joe Abley, Brian Dickson, 2013-06-28,
  <draft-jabley-dnsop-as112-dname-00.txt>

      Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses that
      are not globally unique.  Examples are the addresses designated in
      RFC 1918 for private use within individual sites.
      
      Devices in such environments may occasionally originate Domain Name
      System (DNS) queries (so-called "reverse lookups") corresponding to
      those private-use addresses.  Since the addresses concerned have only
      local significance, it is good practice for site administrators to
      ensure that such queries are answered locally.  However, it is not
      uncommon for such queries to follow the normal delegation path in the
      public DNS instead of being answered within the site.
      
      It is not possible for public DNS servers to give useful answers to
      such queries.  In addition, due to the wide deployment of private-use
      addresses and the continuing growth of the Internet, the volume of
      such queries is large and growing.  The AS112 project aims to provide
      a distributed sink for such queries in order to reduce the load on
      the IN-ADDR.ARPA authoritative servers.  The AS112 project is named
      after the Autonomous System Number (ASN) that was assigned to it.
      
      The AS112 project does not accommodate the addition and removal of
      DNS zones elegantly.  Since additional zones of definitively local
      significance are known to exist, this presents a problem.  This
      document describes modifications to the deployment and use of AS112
      infrastructure that will allow zones to be added and dropped much
      more easily.

  "Network Configuration Negotiation Problem Statement and Requirements",
  Sheng Jiang, Yuanbin Yin, Brian Carpenter, 2013-06-29,
  <draft-jiang-config-negotiation-ps-00.txt>

      This document describes a problem statement and general requirements
      for distributed autonomous configuration of multiple aspects of
      networks, in particular carrier networks. The basic model is that
      network elements need to negotiate configuration settings with each
      other to meet overall goals. The document describes a generic
      discovery and negotiation behavior model. The document also reviews
      whether existing management and configuration protocols may be
      suitable for autonomic networks.

  "IPv6 Site Renumbering Operational Guidelines", Bing Liu, 2013-06-29,
  <draft-liu-opsarea-ipv6-renumbering-guidelines-00.txt>

      This document gives some basic operational guidelines for an IPv6
      site renumbering event. This document considers an renumbering event
      as several basic operational stages as numbering, adding a new prefix,
      and deprecating old prefix(es) and guidelines are given according to
      each stage. Besides the general guidelines, this document also gives
      some considerations on some specific operations such as ND/DHCPv6
      collaboration, DHCPv6 reconfiguration, secure dynamic DNS update and
      multicast.

  "Secure DHCPv6 with Public Key", Sheng Jiang, Sean Shen, 2013-06-29,
  <draft-jiang-dhc-sedhcpv6-00.txt>

      The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) enables
      DHCPv6 servers to pass configuration parameters. It offers
      configuration flexibility. If not secured, DHCPv6 is vulnerable to
      various attacks, particularly spoofing attacks. This document
      analyzes the security issues of DHCPv6 and specifies a Secure DHCPv6
      mechanism. This mechanism is based on public/private key pairs. The
      authority of the sender may depend on either pre-configuration
      mechanism or Public Key Infrastructure.

  "Running Multiple IPv6 Prefixes", Bing Liu, 2013-06-29,
  <draft-liu-running-multiple-prefixes-00.txt>

      This document introduces that multiple prefixes in one network/host
      might be common in IPv6, and describes several multiple prefixes use
      cases that might be beneficial to the network. Then some operational
      considerations and current gaps to support multiple prefixes
      operations are described.

  "The WebSocket Protocol as a Transport for the Remote Framebuffer
  Protocol (RFB)", Pierre Garnero, 2013-06-29,
  <draft-garnero-rfb-websocket-00.txt>

      The WebSocket protocol enables two-way realtime communication between
      clients and servers in web-based applications.  This document
      specifies a WebSocket sub-protocol as a reliable transport mechanism
      between RFB (Remote Framebuffer Protocol) entities to enable usage of
      RFB in web-oriented deployments.

      This document defines a set of Information Elements for the IP Flow
      Information Export (IPFIX) protocol to include location information
      of any device (both fixed and mobile) that acts as an IPFIX Flow
      Exporter. The specified Information Elements support both geodetic
      and civic location data.

  "The Use of Big Labels for BGP/MPLS IP VPN", Renwei Li, Katherine Zhao,
  Walter Wu, 2013-06-30, <draft-renwei-l3vpn-big-label-00.txt>

      This document describes big labels in L3VPN.

  "Encoding of Big Labels in MPLS Label Stacks", Renwei Li, Ming Li,
  2013-06-30, <draft-renwei-mpls-big-label-00.txt>

      This document specifies encoding and encapsulation methods for MPLS
      big labels.  Big labels are required for accessing virtual networks
      in data centers by using, for example, BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  Data center
      virtualization encapsulation methods and protocols such as VXLAN,
      NVGRE and NVO3 are being standardized to support a few millions of
      virtual networks, but the currently label format can support up to
      one million of labels.  When the BGP/MPLS IP VPN method, for example,
      is used by an enterprise/customer to access its corresponding virtual
      networks, more than one million of labels are required to map VPN
      labels and Virtual Network Identifiers.

  "Carrying Big Labels in BGP-4", Renwei Li, Lin Han, 2013-06-30,
  <draft-renwei-mpls-bgp-big-label-00.txt>

      When BGP is used to distribute a particular route, it can also be
      used to distribute an MPLS label which is mapped to that route.  In
      some cases, for example, when L3VPN is used to access and connect to
      virtual networks in data centers, there may be 16 millions of VPN
      instances on a router.  In order to map MPLS labels to VPN instances,
      big labels are required.  This document specifies the method to carry
      and distribute such big labels by piggybacking the big label mapping
      information for an IP route in the BGP Update message that is used to
      distribute the route itself.

  "IPv4-IPv6 Multicast Address Dynamic Conversion", Yalin Cao, Cui Wang,
  Wei Meng, Bhumip Khasnabish, 2013-06-30,
  <draft-tsao-mboned-v4v6mcast-dynamic-conversion-00.txt>

      This draft describes a mechanism for stateless conversion of IPv4
      multicast address to IPv6 multicast address and vice versa,using
      different rules.  These rules can be used in both IPv4-IPv6
      translation or encapsulation.  This solution can be used in any
      scenarios describe in [RFC6144].

  "Minion - Service Model and Conceptual API", Jana, Stuart Cheshire, Josh
  Graessley, 2013-07-15, <draft-iyengar-minion-concept-01.txt>

      Minion uses TCP-format packets on-the-wire, to provide full
      compatibility with existing NATs, Firewalls, and similar middleboxes,
      but provides a richer set of facilities to the application.  Minion's
      richer facilities include a message-oriented API rather than TCP's
      unstructured byte-stream service model, multiplexing of multiple
      messages (or message streams) on a single connection, interleaving of
      multiplexed messages (to eliminate head-of-line blocking), message
      cancellation, request/reply support, ordered and unordered messages,
      chained messages, multiple priority levels with byte-granularity
      preemption, and DTLS Security.  Minion can be implemented entirely as
      a user-level library, without waiting for any special support from OS
      vendors, and provides immediate benefits to application developers.
      Additionally, Minion is able to take advantage of some simple kernel
      extensions to provide enhanced services that go beyond what is
      possible with traditional TCP.  These kernel extensions are optional,
      and even without them, Minion offers worthwhile benefits to
      application developers.

  "Minion - Wire Protocol", Jana, Stuart Cheshire, Josh Graessley,
  2013-07-15, <draft-iyengar-minion-protocol-01.txt>

      Minion uses TCP-format packets on-the-wire, for compatibility with
      existing NATs, Firewalls, and similar middleboxes, but provides a
      richer set of facilities to the application, as described in the
      Minion Service Model document.  This document specifies the details
      of the on-the-wire protocol used to provide those services.

  "Framework for accessing IPv6 content for IPv4-only clients", Branimir
  Rajtar, Ian Farrer, Vizdal Ales, Xing Li, Congxiao Bao, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-rfvlb-behave-v6-content-for-v4-clients-01.txt>

      With the expansion of IPv6 usage and content available on IPv6, it is
      important that clients with legacy (i.e. non IPv6-capable) operating
      systems are able to access such content.
      
      This document describes a method for achieving this, including how
      the method could be implemented in real-world scenarios.

  "Segment Routing Fast Reroute", Pierre Francois, Clarence Filsfils,
  Ahmed Bashandy, Stefano Previdi, Bruno Decraene, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-francois-sr-frr-00.txt>

      This document presents a Fast Reroute approach aimed at providing
      link protection of nodal and adjacency segments to the Segment
      Routing framework.  This FRR behavior builds on proven IP-FRR
      concepts being LFAs, remote LFAs (RLFA), and remote LFAs with
      directed forwarding (DLFA).  We describe their implementation using
      SR segments.  We then analyze the benefits brought by Segment Routing
      to the scalability of such IP-FRR approaches.

  "DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE)", Richard Alimi, Akbar
  Rahman, Dirk Kutscher, Yang Yang, Haibin Song, Kostas Pentikousis,
  2013-07-06, <draft-alimi-decade-01.txt>

      Content distribution applications, such as those those employing
      peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies, are widely used on the Internet and
      make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks.  Often,
      however, content distribution applications use network resources in a
      counter-productive manner.  One way to improve efficiency is to
      introduce storage capabilities within the network and enable
      cooperation between end-host and in-network content distribution
      mechanisms.  This is the capability provided by a DECADE system,
      which is introduced in this document.  DECADE enables applications to
      take advantage of in-network storage when distributing data objects
      as opposed to using solely end-to-end resources.  This document
      presents the underlying principles and key functionalities of such a
      system and illustrates operation through a set of examples.

  "Relative JSON Pointers", Geraint Luff, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-luff-relative-json-pointer-00.txt>

      JSON Pointer is a syntax for specifying locations in a JSON document,
      starting from the document root.  This document defines an extension
      to the JSON Pointer syntax, allowing relative locations from within
      the document.

  "Gap Analysis for Operating IPv6-only MPLS Networks", Wesley George,
  Carlos Pignataro, Rajiv Asati, Kamran Raza, Ron Bonica, Rajiv Papneja,
  Dhruv Dhody, Vishwas Manral, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-george-mpls-ipv6-only-gap-01.txt>

      This document reviews the MPLS protocol suite in the context of IPv6
      and identifies gaps that must be addressed in order to allow MPLS-
      related protocols and applications to be used with IPv6-only
      networks.  This document is not intended to highlight a particular
      vendor's implementation (or lack thereof) in the context of IPv6-only
      MPLS functionality, but rather to focus on gaps in the standards
      defining the MPLS suite.

  "Highly Automated Method for Maintaining Expiring Records", Warren
  Kumari, Roy Arends, Suzanne Woolf, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-wkumari-dnsop-hammer-00.txt>

      the most popular records in the DNS cache.

  "Encapsulation of TCP and other Transport Protocols over UDP", Stuart
  Cheshire, Josh Graessley, Rory McGuire, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-cheshire-tcp-over-udp-00.txt>

      Encapsulation of TCP and other transport protocols over UDP enables
      use of UDP-based NAT traversal techniques with other transport
      protocols.

  "CoAP Implementation Guidance", Matthias Kovatsch, Olaf Bergmann, Esko
  Dijk, Xuan He, Carsten Bormann, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-kovatsch-lwig-coap-01.txt>

      The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is designed for resource-
      constrained nodes and networks, e.g., sensor nodes in a low-power
      lossy network (LLN).  Yet to implement this Internet protocol on
      Class 1 devices (i.e., ~ 10 KiB of RAM and ~ 100 KiB of ROM) also
      lightweight implementation techniques are necessary.  This document
      provides lessons learned from implementing CoAP for tiny, battery-
      operated networked embedded systems.  The guidelines for transmission
      state management and developer APIs can also help with the
      implementation of CoAP for less constrained nodes.

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2.0", Mike Belshe, Roberto Peon,
  Martin Thomson, Alexey Melnikov, 2013-07-03,
  <draft-unicorn-httpbis-http2-01.txt>

      This specification describes an optimized expression of the syntax of
      the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  The HTTP/2.0 encapsulation
      enables more efficient use of network resources and reduced
      perception of latency by allowing header field compression and
      multiple concurrent messages on the same connection.  It also
      introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to
      clients.
      
      This document is an alternative to, but does not obsolete the
      HTTP/1.1 message format or protocol.  HTTP's existing semantics
      remain unchanged.
      
      This version of the draft has been marked for implementation.
      Interoperability testing will occur in the HTTP/2.0 interim in
      Hamburg, DE, starting 2013-08-05.

  "Terminology for Benchmarking LDP Data Plane Convergence", Bhavani
  Parise, Rajiv Papneja, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-parise-ldp-convergence-term-00.txt>

      This document defines new terms for benchmarking of LDP convergence.
      These terms are to be used in future methodology documents for
      benchmarking LDP Convergence.  Existing BMWG terminology documents
      such as IGP Convergence Benchmarking [RFC 6412] provide useful terms
      for LDP Convergence benchmarking.  These terms are discussed in this
      document.  Applicable terminology for MPLS and LDP defined in MPLS WG
      RFCs [RFC 3031] and [RFC 5036] are also discussed.

  "Meta-data Attribute signaLling with ICE", Reinaldo Penno, Paal-Erik
  Martinsen, Dan Wing, Anca Zamfir, 2013-07-02,
  <draft-martinsen-mmusic-malice-00.txt>

      It can be useful for applications to provide flow metadata
      information to on-path devices to influence flow treatment in the
      network.  Provided that the network is able to provide useful
      feedback, this can also influence path selection if an application
      have multiple flow paths to choose from.
      
      This draft describes how this can be achieved by adding metadata to
      the STUN packets sent during the ICE connectivity checks or a
      slightly modified version of the keep-alive mechanism.  Devices on
      the media path can use the metadata information to prioritize the
      flow, perform traffic engineering, or provide network analytics and
      notifications as requested by the endpoints.  On-path devices can
      append or modify the existing metadata information in the STUN/ICE
      messages to enable feedback to other on-path devices or the
      applications in both ends of the media session.
      
      This document describes a framework mechanism for how such metadata
      can be transported by STUN when ICE is in use and it covers the
      endpoint and on path device processing.  The functionality described
      here is referred to as MALICE.

  "Simple Failover Mechanism for Lightweight 4over6", Yiu Lee, Qiong Sun,
  Cong Liu, 2013-07-15, <draft-lee-softwire-lw4over6-failover-01.txt>

      This memo specifies a simple mechanism for Lightweight AFTR (lwAFTR)
      to notify Lightweight B4 (lwB4) to initiate the recreation of the
      binding when lwAFTR does not have the subscriber mapping in the
      mapping table.  This often happens at failover the backup lwAFTR does
      not have the subscriber mapping information to process the packets
      between lwB4 and external IPv4 host.

  "Multicast Support for Mapping of Address and Port Protocol", Behcet
  Sarikaya, 2013-07-02, <draft-sarikaya-softwire-map-multicast-00.txt>

      This memo specifies MAP-E's multicast component so that IPv4 hosts
      can receive multicast data from IPv4 servers over an IPv6 network.
      In the encapsulation solution for encapsulation variant of Mapping of
      Address and Port (MAP), MAP-E, IGMP Proxy at the MAP-E Customer Edge
      router uses IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel established by MAP-E to exchange IGMP
      messages to establish multicast state at MAP-E Border Relay so that
      MAP-E Border Relay can tunnel IPv4 multicast data to IPv4 hosts
      connected to MAP-E Customer Edge device.  In the Translation
      Multicast solution for the translation variant of MAP, MAP-T and 4rd,
      IGMP messages are translated into MLD messages at the CE router which
      is IGMP/MLD Proxy and sent to the network in IPv6.  MAP-T/4rd Border
      Relay does the reverse translation and joins IPv4 multicast group for
      MAP-T/4rd hosts.  Border Relay as multicast router receives IPv4
      multicast data and translates the packet into IPv6 multicast data and
      sends downstream on the multicast tree.  Member CEs receive multicast
      data, translate it back to IPv4 and transmit to the hosts.

  "End-to-end Data Integrity Feature For NFSv4", Chuck Lever, 2013-07-02,
  <draft-cel-nfsv4-end2end-data-protection-00.txt,.ps,.pdf>

      End-to-end data integrity protection provides a strong guarantee that
      data an application reads from durable storage is exactly the same
      data it wrote previously to durable storage.  This document specifies
      possible additions to the NFSv4 protocol enabling it to convey end-
      to-end data integrity information between client and server.

  "Improved Support for Icalendar Relationships", Mike Douglass,
  2013-07-02, <draft-douglass-ical-relations-00.txt,.pdf>

      This specification updates RELATED-TO and introduces new iCalendar
      properties LINK and RELATED-ID to allow better linking and grouping
      of iCalendar components and related data.

  "Mitigation against IPv6 Router Advertisements flooding", S Moonesamy,
  2013-07-02, <draft-moonesamy-ra-flood-limit-00.txt>

      An IPv6 Router Advertisements flooding attack can cause a node to
      consume all CPU resources available making the system unusable and
      unresponsive. This document recommends some configurable variables as
      a mitigation against an IPv6 Router Advertisements flooding attack.

  "Configuration must not be carried by the routing protocol", Juliusz
  Chroboczek, 2013-07-02,

      Where I argue that configuration information must be carried by a
      protocol separate from the routing protocol.

  "Efficient Chunk Availability Compression for PPSP", Deng Lingli, Jin
  Peng, Yunfei Zhang, 2013-07-30, <draft-deng-ppsp-bfbitmap-02.txt>

      This draft proposes to employ bloom filters in compressing chunk
      availability information, which is periodically exchanged between
      peers and the tracker through both the PPSP-TP protocol and PPSPP
      protocol, so as to reduce relevant cost (in transmission, storage and
      computation) and enhance the overall system's scalability.

  "Terminology for Benchmarking LDP Data Plane Convergence", Bhavani
  Parise, Rajiv Papneja, 2013-07-02,
  <draft-parise-bmwg-ldp-convergence-term-00.txt>

      This document defines new terms for benchmarking of LDP convergence.
      These terms are to be used in future methodology documents for
      benchmarking LDP Convergence.  Existing BMWG terminology documents
      such as IGP Convergence Benchmarking [RFC 6412] provide useful terms
      for LDP Convergence benchmarking.  These terms are discussed in this
      document.  Applicable terminology for MPLS and LDP defined in MPLS WG
      RFCs [RFC 3031] and [RFC 5036] are also discussed.

  "Revealing hosts sharing an IP address using ICMP Echo Request", Andrew
  Yourtchenko, 2013-07-03, <draft-yourtchenko-fmc-nat-reveal-ping-00.txt>

      When an IP address is shared among several subscribers -- with a NAT
      or with an application-level proxy -- it is impossible for the server
      to differentiate between different clients.  Such differentiation is
      valuable in several scenarios.  This memo proposes a technique to
      differentiate TCP and UDP clients sharing an IP address.  The
      proposed method uses an ICMP Echo Request packet, which allows for
      more information about the user mapping to be transmitted than in the
      case of using the TCP option - and allows the use with UDP and other
      protocols.

  "The NetInf Bluetooth Convergence Layer", Linus Sunde, 2013-07-03,
  <draft-sunde-netinf-protocol-bluetooth-00.txt>

      This document defines a Network of Information (NetInf) convergence
      layer intended to be used over some Bluetooth protocol providing
      reliable transmission.  A convergence layer handles the transport of
      NetInf requests and responses.  In this convergence layer the common
      NetInf messages are defined using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
      and Named Data Object (NDO) octet parts, both using length prefixes.
      While the convergence layer is intended to be used over Bluetooth,
      any underlying protocol providing reliable transmission could
      potentially be used.

  "SDN State Reduction", Peter Ashwood-Smith, Mourad Soliman, Tao Wan,
  2013-07-03, <draft-ashwood-sdnrg-state-reduction-00.txt>

      This document makes the argument that to support the centralized
      control of a substantial number of forwarding devices (as Software
      Defined Networking (SDN) proposes) that the scale, speed, cost and
      general quality of such a solution will be improved by reducing
      the state needed to be distributed into the network of devices by
      the controller(s). To this end we re-visit forms of Source Routing
      (SR), in particular Strict Link Source Routing (SLSR) and suggest
      that light weight SLSR could allow substantial reduction in
      controller burden while potentially reducing the costs/complexity
      on forwarding devices. We discuss some simulation results that
      demonstrate these advantages and how the advantages grow
      substantially as the network diameter grows. We also look at
      various implementation possibilities including existing IPV4, V6,
      MPLS, new/modified MPLS vs. something brand new that could
      possibly be implemented with new SDN technology like Protocol
      Oblivious Forwarding-POF.

  "Energy Aware Control Approach for QoS in heterogeneous packet access
  networks", DH, Nico Bayer, Christoph Lange, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-vonhugo-eacp-hetnet-01.txt>

      This document describes an approach to enhance user perceived service
      quality by control protocols following potential network performance
      impairments in case of energy aware network operation.

  "Tunnel Congestion Feedback", Xinpeng Wei, Lei Zhu, 2013-07-03,
  <draft-wei-tsvwg-tunnel-congestion-feedback-00.txt>

      This document describes a mechanism to calculate congestion of a
      tunnel segment based on RFC 6040 recommendations, and a feedback
      protocol by which to send the measured congestion of the tunnel from
      egress to ingress router. A basic  model for measuring tunnel
      congestion and feedback is described, and a protocol for carrying the
      feedback data is outlined.

  "MMHS Draft and Release using S/MIME", Alexey Melnikov, 2013-07-03,
  <draft-melnikov-mmhs-authorizing-users-00.txt>

      This document describes a procedure for when an MMHS message is
      composed by one user and is only released to the mail transfer system
      when one or more authorizing users authorize release of the message
      by adding the MMHS-Authorizing-Users header field.  The resulting
      message can be optionally countersigned, allowing recipients to
      verify both the original signature (if any) and countersignatures.

  "A Mechanism for ECN Path Probing and Fallback", Mirja Kuehlewind, Brian
  Trammell, 2013-07-03, <draft-kuehlewind-tcpm-ecn-fallback-00.txt>

      Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a TCP/IP extension that is
      widely implemented but hardly used due to the perceived unusablilty
      of ECN on many paths through the Internet caused by ECN-ignorant
      routers and middleboxes.  This document specifies an ECN probing and
      fall-back mechanism in case ECN has be successfully negotiated
      between two connection endpoints, but might not be usable on the
      path.

  "Source-specific Routing", Matthieu Boutier, Juliusz Chroboczek,
  2013-07-03, <draft-boutier-homenet-source-specific-routing-00.txt>

      Source-specific routing is a generalisation of next-hop routing in
      which the routing decision is made depending on a packet's source
      address in addition to the destination.  We describe the motivation
      for source-specific routing and our experiences with an experimental
      extension of the Babel routing protocol that implements source-
      specific routing.

  "PCP Flowdata Option", Dan Wing, Reinaldo Penno, Tirumaleswar Reddy,
  2013-07-03, <draft-wing-pcp-flowdata-00.txt>

      This document defines a mechanism for a host to signal flow
      characteristics to the network, and the network to signal its ability
      to accommodate that flow back to the host.  The mechanism defines a
      new PCP option for the existing MAP and PEER opcodes.

  "Corresponding Network Homing", Alper Yegin, Kisuk Kweon, Jinsung Lee,
  Jungshin Park, 2013-07-03, <draft-yegin-dmm-cnet-homing-00.txt>

      Mobile IP protocols provide IP session continuity to Mobile Nodes at
      the expense of creating triangular routes via a centralized Home
      Agent.  Increased latency and network resource use, introduction of a
      single point of failure and a network choke point are among the
      undesirable side effects of the current protocols.  This document
      describes an alternative approach where the Mobile Node makes use of
      dynamically-assigned Home Agent that is located close to the
      Corresponding Node.

  "On Demand Mobility Management", Alper Yegin, Kisuk Kweon, Jinsung Lee,
  Jungshin Park, 2013-07-03, <draft-yegin-dmm-ondemand-mobility-00.txt>

      Applications differ with respect to whether they need IP session
      continuity and/or IP address reachability.  The network providing the
      same type of service to any mobile host and any application running
      on the host yields inefficiencies.  This document describes a
      solution for taking the application needs into account in selectively
      providing IP session continuity and IP address reachability on a per-
      socket basis.

  "Extension of the MLD proxy functionality to support multiple upstream
  interfaces", Luis Contreras, Carlos Bernardos, Juan Zuniga, 2013-07-03,
  <draft-contreras-pim-multiple-upstreams-00.txt>

      This document presents different scenarios of applicability for an
      MLD proxy running more than one upstream interface.  Since those
      scenarios impose different requirements on the MLD proxy with
      multiple upstream interfaces, it is important to ensure that the
      proxy functionality addresses all of them for compatibility.
      
      The purpose of this document is to define the requirements in an MLD
      proxy with multiple interfaces covering a variety of applicability
      scenarios, and to specify the proxy functionality to satisfy all of
      them.

  "A Framework for Signaling Flow Characteristics between Applications and
  the Network", Toerless Eckert, Reinaldo Penno, Amine Choukir, Charles
  Eckel, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-eckert-intarea-flow-metadata-framework-01.txt,.pdf>

      This document provides a framework for communicating information
      elements (a.k.a. metadata) in a consistent manner between
      applications and the network to provide better visibility of
      application flows, thereby enabling differentiated treatment of those
      flows.  These information elements can be conveyed using various
      signaling protocols, including PCP, RSVP, and STUN.

  "A recommendation for RRC agreement in 3rd Generation Partnership
  Project(3GPP) standard", Sha Zhang, Jie Huang, 2013-07-03,
  <draft-zhang-rrc-3gpp-recommend-00.txt>

      This document contains a recommendation to the Third Generation
      Partnership Project(3GPP) community regarding the RRC agreement.
      Specifically, this document RECOMMENDS that a network credential MUST
      be attributed to each user, and the user identity MUST be verified in
      the RRC connection establishment phase.

  "Considerations for ALTO with network-deployed P2P caches", Deng Lingli,
  Wei Chen, Qiuchao Yi, Yan Zhang, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-deng-alto-p2pcache-02.txt>

      Uploading from peers located in a public WLAN hotspot has been
      reported to severely impact other current users' experiences, and
      raised caution from the operator's side who are willing to
      increasingly participate in building public WLAN facilities to
      offload the explosive mobile data traffic from cellular networks.
      Cooperation between the network operator and the P2P service
      providers in form of intra-domain P2P caches is expected to be an
      effective mechanism to solve the problem.  This draft introduces
      considerations on ALTO deployment in terms of P2P caches and
      discusses potential extensions to the ALTO protocol to standardize
      this mutual cooperation.

  "A privacy protection scheme for AKA agreement in 3rd Generation
  Partnership Project(3GPP) standard", Sha Zhang, Jie Huang, 2013-07-03,
  <draft-zhang-aka-privacy-3gpp-00.txt>

      This document contains a privacy protection scheme for the AKA
      agreement in the 3GPP standards.  Specifically, this document
      RECOMMENDS that each user owns a encryption key updated in real time,
      with which to encrypt the user identity.  Comparing with the
      asymmetric encryption and alias assignment, the symmetric encryption
      scheme proposed in this document not only reduce the computation
      burden, but also prevent the legal user from being located and
      tracked.

  "Recording VoiceXML sessions with SIPREC", Henry Lum, 2013-07-03,
  <draft-lum-siprec-vxml-00.txt>

      This document addresses the use case of recording Interactive Voice
      Response (IVR) VoiceXML applications using the SIPREC protocol.  This
      document also provides a potential solution for capturing additional
      information about the call flow within the VoiceXML application from
      a recording perspective.

  "DTLS-based Security with two-way Authentication for IoT", Corinna
  Schmitt, Burkhard Stiller, Thomas Kothmayr, Wen Hu, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-schmitt-two-way-authentication-for-iot-00.txt>

      In this draft the first key idea for a full two-way authentication
      security scheme for the Internet of Things (IoT) based on existing
      Internet standards, specifically the Datagram Transport Layer
      Security (DTLS) protocol, is introduced.  By relying on an
      established standard, existing implementations, engineering
      techniques, and security infrastructure can be reused, which enables
      an easy security uptake.  The proposed security scheme is, therefore,
      based on RSA, the most widely used public key cryptography algorithm.
      It is designed to work over standard communication stacks that offer
      UDP/IPv6 networking for Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks
      (6LoWPANs).

  "Measuring the Effects of Happy Eyeballs", Vaibhav Bajpai, Jürgen
  Schönwälder, 2013-07-14, <draft-bajpai-happy-01.txt>

      The IETF has developed solutions that promote a healthy IPv4 and IPv6
      co-existence.  The happy eyeballs algorithm for instance, provides
      recommendations to application developers to help prevent bad user
      experience in situations where IPv6 connectivity is broken.  This
      document describes a metric used to measure the effects of the happy
      eyeballs algorithm.  The insights uncovered by analysing the data
      from multiple locations is discussed.

  "Use cases for operating networks in the overlay model context", Daniele
  Ceccarelli, Oscar de Dios, Fatai Zhang, Xian Zhang, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-ceccadedios-ccamp-overlay-use-cases-01.txt>

      This document defines a set of use cases for operating networks in
      the overlay model context through the Generalized Multiprotocol Label
      Switching (GMPLS) overlay interfaces.

  and BFD Path Tracing", Nobo Akiya, Carlos Pignataro, David Ward,
  2013-07-04, <draft-akiya-bfd-seamless-alert-discrim-00.txt,.pdf>

      This specification defines a concept of alert discriminator which
      operates over Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD).
      New diagnostic codes, solely to be used together with alert
      discriminators, are also defined in this specification.

  "MPL Parameter Configuration Option for DHCPv6", Yusuke Doi, Matthew
  Gillmore, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-doi-roll-mpl-parameter-configuration-02.txt>

      This draft is to define a way to configure MPL parameter via DHCPv6
      option.

  "An incremental solution to advanced home networking", Victor Kuarsingh,
  John Brzozowski, Chris Grundemann, John McQueen, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-jvkjjmb-home-networking-incremental-00.txt>

      The home network is an environment subject to ongoing evolution and
      change.  Many home networks today are simplistic in nature, often
      comprising of a single router/gateway.  The expectation over time is
      predicated on the notion that the home network will be more complex
      servicing many in-home and Internet functions.  The home network will
      evolve necessitating the replacement and update to current hardware
      and software to more advanced devices and software capable of
      operating in more complex environments.  This document provides a
      view on how the home network can progress from today's foundational
      form, to a more advanced environment, using progressive technological
      capabilities.

  "Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery using Domain Name
  System(DNS)", Wenson Wu, Dhruv Dhody, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-wu-pce-dns-pce-discovery-01.txt>

      Discovery of the Path Computation Element (PCE) within an IGP area or
      domain is possible using OSPF [RFC5088] and IS-IS [RFC5089].
      However, in some deployment scenarios PCEs may not wish, or be able,
      to participate within the IGP process,therefore it would be
      beneficial for the Path Computation Client (PCC) (or other PCEs) to
      discover PCEs via an alternative mechanism to those proposed in
      [RFC5088] and [RFC5089].
      
      This document specifies the requirements, use cases, procedures and
      extensions to support discovery via DNS for PCE.

  "Use cases and requirements for authentication, authorisation and

  "Simplified Extension of interface Space for IS-IS", Changwang Lin,
  Haifeng Zhang, Vishwas Manral, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-lz-isis-relax-interfaces-limit-00.txt>

      This document describes a simplified method for extending the
      interface space beyond the 255 interfaces limit. The proposed
      mechanism does not require any changes to the IS-IS protocol.

  "DHCP DNS Public Authoritative Server Option", Daniel Migault, Wouter
  Cloetens, Chris Griffiths, Ralf Weber, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-mglt-dhc-public-authoritative-server-option-00.txt,.pdf>

      The home network naming architecture as described in
      [I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation] requires a complex
      naming configuration on the CPE.  This configuration MAY not be
      handled easily by the average end user.  Furthermore, such
      misconfiguration MAY result in making home network unreachable.
      
      This document proposes a DHCP option that provides the CPE all
      necessary parameters to set up the home network naming architecture.
      
      First, this DHCP option provides automatic configuration and avoids
      most end users' misconfigurations.  Most average end users may not
      require specific configuration, and their ISP default configuration
      MAY fully address their needs.  In that case, the naming homenet
      architecture configuration will be completely transparent to the end
      users.  Then, saving naming configuration outside the CPE, makes it
      resilient to change of CPE or CPE upgrades.  Such configuration may
      also be configured by the end user, via the customer area of their
      ISP.

  "LSP-DB Synchronization between Stateful PCEs", Udayasree Palle, Dhruv
  Dhody, Xian Zhang, 2013-07-28,
  <draft-palle-pce-stateful-pce-lspdb-sync-01.txt>

      The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
      mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
      computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
      
      [STATEFUL-PCE] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to enable
      stateful control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) via
      PCEP and maintaining of these LSPs at the stateful PCE.  This
      document describes the mechanisms of LSP Database (LSP-DB)
      synchronization between stateful PCEs.

  "Information Model for Large-Scale Measurement Platforms (LMAP)", Trevor
  Burbridge, Philip Eardley, Marcelo Bagnulo, Jürgen Schönwälder,
  2013-07-05, <draft-burbridge-lmap-information-model-00.txt>

      This Information Model applies to the Measurement Agent within a
      Large-Scale Measurement Platform.  As such it outlines the
      information the is pre-configured on the MA or exists in
      communications with a Controller or Collector within an LMAP
      framework.  The purpose of such an Information Model is to provide a
      protocol and device independent view of the MA that can be
      implemented via one or more Control and Report protocols.

  "KEEP_OLD_IKE_SA Extension", Daniel Migault, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-mglt-ipsecme-keep-old-ike-sa-00.txt,.pdf>

      This document considers a VPN Client setting a VPN with a security
      gateway where at least one of the peer has multiple interfaces.
      
      With the current IKEv2, the outer IP addresses of the VPN are
      determined by those used by IKEv2 channel.  As a result using
      multiple interface requires to set an IKEv2 channel on each
      interface, and then on each paths if both the VPN Client and the
      security gateway have multiple interfaces.  Setting multiple IKEv2
      channel involves multiple authentications which MAY each require
      multiple round trips and delay the VPN establishment.  In addition
      multiple authentications unnecessarily load the VPN client and the
      authentication infrastructure.
      
      This document presents the KEEP_OLD_IKE_SA extension, where an
      additional IKEv2 channel from an already authenticated IKEv2 channel.
      The newly created IKEv2 channel is set without the IKEv2
      authentication exchange.  The newly created IKEv2 channel can then be
      assigned to another interface using MOBIKE.

  "Access Control Framework for Constrained Environments", Goran Selander,
  Mohit Sethi, Ludwig Seitz, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-selander-core-access-control-00.txt>

      The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a light-weight web
      transfer protocol designed to be used in constrained nodes and
      constrained networks.  Communication security support for CoAP,
      including authentication, encryption, integrity protection, is well
      understood and a DTLS binding for CoAP is specified, but
      authorization and access control are not described in detail.
      
      This document describes a generic and dynamic access control
      framework suitable for constrained environments using CoAP.  The
      framework builds on standards and well known paradigms for access
      control, externalizing authorization decision making to unconstrained
      nodes while performing authorization decision enforcement and
      verification of local conditions in constrained devices.
      
      In addition, this document provides alternative or complementary key
      management to the CoAP security modes.

  "Asserting DNS Policy Realm Boundaries: The SOPA Resource Record",
  Andrew Sullivan, Jeff Hodges, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-sullivan-domain-policy-authority-00.txt>

      Some Internet client entities on the Internet make inferences about
      the administrative relationships among services on the Internet based
      on the domain names at which they are offered.  At present, it is not
      possible to ascertain organizational administrative boundaries in the
      DNS, therefore such inferences can be erroneous in various ways.
      Mitigation strategies deployed so far will not scale.  The solution
      presented in this memo is to provide a means to make explicit
      assertions regarding certain administrative relationships between
      domain names.

  "OAuth 2.0 SCIM Client Registration Profile", Phil Hunt, Morteza Ansari,
  Anthony Nadalin, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-hunt-oauth-scim-client-reg-00.txt,.pdf>

      This specification defines a SCIM endpoint used to register and
      provision OAuth 2.0 clients to access a OAuth 2.0 protected service
      API in a just-in-time fashion.  This draft profiles how a OAuth 2.0
      client may use SCIM and OAuth 2.0 to manage its registration.

  "Requirements for operator policy in GMPLS networks consisting of
  protected links", Ben Wright, Jonathan Hardwick, Vishnu Shukla, Junjie
  Li, 2013-07-05, <draft-wright-ccamp-op-policy-prot-links-00.txt>

      This document describes policy options required by network operators
      in networks including APS links or links with an inherent protection
      capability.  It also identifies gaps in the current GMPLS standards
      which may prevent these policy options from being implemented.

  "DTLS-based Multicast Security for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs)",
  Sye Keoh, Sandeep Kumar, Oscar Garcia-Morchon, Esko Dijk, 2013-07-06,
  <draft-keoh-dtls-multicast-security-00.txt>

      Wireless IP-based systems will be increasingly used for building
      control systems in the future where wireless devices interconnect
      with each other, forming low-power and lossy networks (LLNs).  The
      CoAP/6LoWPAN standards are emerging as the de-facto protocols in this
      area for resource-constrained devices.  Both multicast and security
      are key needs in these networks.  This draft presents a method for
      securing multicast communication in LLNs based on the DTLS which is
      already present in CoAP devices.  This draft deals with the
      adaptation of the DTLS record layer to protect multicast group
      communication, assuming that all member devices already have a group
      key in their own possession.  The DTLS record layer implementation is
      used to encrypt a multicast message and to provide message
      authentication using the group key before sending the message via IP
      multicast to the group.

      configuration.

  "LSP Synchronization for Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE)", Xian
  Zhang, Gang Xie, Dhruv Dhody, 2013-07-07,
  <draft-zhx-pce-stateful-lsp-sync-00.txt>

      The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
      mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
      computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
      
      [Stateful-pcep] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to enable
      stateful control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) via
      PCEP and maintaining of these LSPs at the stateful PCE.  This
      document describes the mechanisms for incremental LSP Database (LSP-
      DB) synchronization as well as PCE control of the LSP-DB
      synchronization process.

  "Auto Discovery VPN Protocol", Yu Mao, ZhanQun Wang, Vishwas Manral,
  2013-07-14, <draft-mao-ipsecme-ad-vpn-protocol-01.txt>

      This document describes the Auto Discovery VPN (ADVPN) protocol, the
      use case and problem statement for which is described in
      [ADVPN_Problem]. The ADVPN protocol is used for enabling a large of
      number of entities to communicate directly among the peers, with
      minimal configuration and operator intervention. The solution uses
      IPsec[RFC4301] to protect communication between the peers.

  "Simplified and Asynchronous Security Context Interfaces for the Generic
  Security Services Application Programming Interface", Nico Williams,
  2013-07-07, <draft-williams-kitten-ctx-simple-async-00.txt>

      This Internet-Draft proposes extensions to the Generic Security
      Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) for replacing
      the exiting GSS_Init_sec_context() and GSS_Accept_sec_context()
      functions with simplified forms that also support asynchrony.

  <draft-gellens-mmusic-negotiating-human-language-01.txt>

      Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities, and
      preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.  When
      establishing interactive communication "calls" there needs to be a
      way to communicate and ideally match (i.e., negotiate) the caller's
      language preferences with the capabilities of the called party.  This
      is especially important with emergency calls, where a call can be
      routed to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) or call taker
      capable of communicating with the user, or a translator or relay
      operator can be bridged into the call during setup, but this applies
      to non-emergency calls as well (as an example, when calling a company
      call center).
      
      This document describes the need and expected use, and describes a
      solution using new SDP stream attributes plus an optional SIP "hint."

  "Generic Naming Attributes for the Generic Security Services Application
  Programming Interface (GSS-API)", Nico Williams, 2013-07-07,
  <draft-williams-kitten-generic-naming-attributes-00.txt>

      This document specifies several useful generic naming attributes for
      use with the Generic Security Services Application Programming
      Interface (GSS-API) Naming Extensions specified in RFC6680.
      
      These attributes allow applications to extract discrete components of
      a GSS-API "mechanism name" (MN) object: issuer (e.g., realm name,
      domain name, certification authority name), service and host names
      (for host-based service names), user names, and others.

  "Coloring based IP Flow Performance Measurement Framework", Mach Chen,
  Hongming Liu, Yuanbin Yin, Rajiv Papneja, Shailesh Abhyankar, Guangqing
  Deng, 2013-07-07,
  <draft-chen-ippm-coloring-based-ipfpm-framework-00.txt>

      By setting one unused bit of the IP header of packets to "color" the
      packets into different color blocks, it naturally gives a way to
      measure the real packet loss and delay without inserting any extra
      OAM packets.  This is called "coloring" based IP Flow Performance
      Measurement (IPFPM).  This document specifies a framework for this
      "coloring" based IPFPM and defines a new application to the IPFIX for
      exporting the performance measurement statistic data.

  "Network as a service requirement in cloud datacenter", Chen Li, Rong

  "Analysis of SDN Controller Cluster in Large-scale Production Networks",
  Zehn Cao, 2013-07-07, <draft-zcao-sdnrg-controller-00.txt>

      Software Defined Networking necessitates an efficient, scalable,
      secure Controller Cluster.  This document analyzes the problems of
      implementing and deploying a successful controller system and figures
      out the requirements therein.  This document also proposes a set of
      benchmarks for controller performance evaluation.

  "A REST API For Access To TURN Services", Justin Uberti, 2013-07-07,
  <draft-uberti-rtcweb-turn-rest-00.txt>

      This document describes a proposed standard REST API for obtaining
      access to TURN services via ephemeral (i.e. time-limited)
      credentials.  These credentials are vended by a web service over
      HTTP, and then supplied to and checked by a TURN server using the
      standard TURN protocol.  The usage of ephemeral credentials ensures
      that access to the TURN server can be controlled even if the
      credentials can be discovered by the user, as is the case in WebRTC
      where TURN credentials must be specified in Javascript.

  "Proposal for reusing local codec APIs on mobile devices", Deng Lingli,
  Lingfei Ni, Yu Qing, 2013-07-07, <draft-deng-rtcweb-codecapi-00.txt>

      This document proposes the browser to make use of local codec APIs,
      if available on a mobile device, and notifies RTCWEB applications to
      allow for better tuning between device capability and media quality.

  "JSON Format Extensions for Traffic Engineering (TE) performance metrics
  in the ALTO Information Resource Directory", Wenson Wu, Liang Xia,
  2013-07-28, <draft-wu-alto-json-te-01.txt>

      The base ALTO specification defines two properties for cost metric
      attribute in the Cost MAP, including 'hopcount' and 'routingcost'.
      This specification define five new cost metric and one new parameter
      for Traffic Engineering(TE) performance information in the ALTO
      Information Resource Directory: Link Delay, Delay Variation, Packet
      Loss, Residual Bandwidth, Available Bandwidth,linkstate.  They can be
      used either as constraint attribute associated with cost metric
      attribute 'routingcost' or returned cost metric in the response.

  "Time Capability in NETCONF", Tal Mizrahi, Yoram Moses, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-mm-netconf-time-capability-00.txt>

      This document defines a capability-based extension to the Network
      Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) that allows time-triggered
      configuration and management operations. This extension allows
      NETCONF clients to invoke configuration updates according to
      scheduled times, and allows NETCONF servers to attach timestamps to
      the data they send to NETCONF clients.

  "Problem Statement for Flow Control of MIF Hosts", Dapeng Liu,
  2013-07-08, <draft-liu-mif-flow-control-ps-00.txt>

      MIF hosts normally have multiple provisioning domains or interfaces.
      In some cases, the applications running on the MIF hosts need to
      select provisioning domain or interface based on either user
      preferences or network polices.  There is currently no standard ways
      for the MIF hosts to implement this kind of provisioning domain/
      interface selection.  This document discusses the problem statement
      of provisioning domain/interface control of the MIF hosts.

  "Current issues with existing RBNF notation for PCEP messages and
  extensions", Ramon Casellas, Cyril Margaria, Adrian Farrel, Oscar de
  Dios, Dhruv Dhody, Xian Zhang, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-cmfg-pce-pcep-grammar-01.txt>

      The PCEP protocol has been defined in [RFC5440] and later extended in
      several RFCs.  This document aims at documenting inconsistencies when
      implementing a set of extensions and at providing a reference,
      complete and formal RBNF grammar for PCEP messages, including object
      ordering and precedence rules.

  "Mobility Support in Software Defined Networking", Dapeng Liu, Hui Deng,

      This document discusses the SDN mobility problem and potential
      solutions.

  "An Architecture for Overlay Networks (NVO3)", David Black, Jon Hudson,
  Lawrence Kreeger, Marc Lasserre, Thomas Narten, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-narten-nvo3-arch-00.txt>

      This document presents a high-level overview of a possible
      architecture for building overlay networks in NVO3.  The architecture
      is given at a high-level, showing the major components of an overall
      system.  An important goal is to divide the space into individual
      smaller components that can be implemented independently and with
      clear interfaces and interactions with other components.  It should
      be possible to build and implement individual components in isolation
      and have them work with other components with no changes to other
      components.  That way implementers have flexibility in implementing
      individual components and can optimize and innovate within their
      respective components without requiring changes to other components.

  "The Approach for IPv4-only users to access IPv6-only Content",
  Chongfeng Xie, Qiong Sun, Qi He, Cathy Zhou, Xing Li, Congxiao Bao,
  2013-07-28, <draft-sun-behave-v4tov6-01.txt>

      Current approaches can not solve the scenario that the users from
      IPv4 Internet to access IPv6-only content.  When IPv6 content are
      becoming more and more popular, it is important to ensure that IPv6-
      only content can be reachable from legacy IPv4-only clients via some
      IPv4-only network.  This document proposes two approaches for IPv4-
      only users to access IPv6-only content.  It is designed to cover the
      Scenario 2 in [RFC6144].

  "Mega Label - Expansion of MPLS Label Range", Zhenbin Li, Lianshu Zheng,
  2013-07-08, <draft-li-mpls-mega-label-00.txt>

      This document describes the requirement scenarios for expansion of
      MPLS label range.  This document also introduce a framework for
      expansion of MPLS label range-"Mega Label" and the corresponding
      protocol extensions.  This document will update RFC 3032, 5036, 3209
      and 3107 if approved.

  "Proxy MPLS Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path(LSP)", Zhenbin Li,
  Xinzong Zeng, 2013-07-08, <draft-li-mpls-proxy-te-lsp-00.txt>

      This document describes a method to setup MPLS TE proxy egress LSP
      which helps setup end-to-end LSP through stitching MPLS TE proxy
      egress LSP with BGP LSP in the Seamless MPLS network.  The method is
      achieved by new Proxy Destination Object carried in RSVP-TE messages.

  "Segment-Based EVPN(S-EVPN)", Zhenbin Li, Lucy Yong, Junlin Zhang,
  2013-07-08, <draft-li-l2vpn-segment-evpn-00.txt>

      This document proposes an enhanced EVPN mechanism, segment-based EVPN
      (S-EVPN).  It satisfies the requirements of PBB-EVPN but does not
      require PBB implementation on PE.  The solution uses a global label
      for each Ethernet Segment (ES) in an EVPN.  It inserts the source ES
      label into packets at ingress PE and learns C-MAC and source ES label
      binding at egress PE.  The solution makes the implementation easier
      and closer to EVPN's compared to PBB-EVPN but has the PBB-EVPN
      benefits.

  "BGP Extension For L3VPN Performance Monitoring", Hui Ni, Shunwan
  Zhuang, Zhenbin Li, 2013-07-08, <draft-ni-bgp-ext-l3vpn-pm-00.txt>

      This document describes a new VT address family in BGP to exchange
      information required for apply performance monitoring in MPLS/BGP
      VPN, as described in [I-D.dong-l3vpn-pm-framework].

  "BGP Extensions for Service-Driven Co-Routed MPLS Traffic Engineering
  LSP", Hui Ni, Zhenbin Li, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-ni-bgp-ext-sd-co-lsp-00.txt>

      In some large scale L3VPN deployment scenarios like mobile backhaul
      network, it is required that tunnels between two PEs could be setup
      automatically driven by L3VPN service to reduce manual configuration
      effort. Moreover the tunnels must be setup co-routed for the
      goodness of performance monitoring and uniform protection behavior
      for link failure on two directions. This is described in [I-D.li-
      mpls-serv-driven-co-lsp-fmwk]. This document introduces a new
      BGP VT route based on [I-D.ni-bgp-ext-l3vpn-pm]. The route is
      utilized by on side PE to advertise Tunnel ID to other side PE,
      so inverse direction co-routed LSPs can be setup based on path
      information of member LSPs in the first tunnel.

  "Radius Extension for Lightweight 4over6", Chongfeng Xie, Qi Sun, Qiong
  Sun, Cathy Zhou, Tina Tsou, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-sun-softwire-lw4over6-radext-00.txt>

      lightweight 4over6(lw4over6) [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is an
      extension to DS-Lite in which the amount of state maintained in
      lwAFTR has been reduced to per-subscriber-level.  The lwB4 needs to
      be provisioned with the public IPv4 address and port set it is
      allowed to use.  The DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Transport [I.D-ietf-dhc-
      dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
      Option for Port Set [I.D-sun-dhc-port-set-option] can be used for
      lwB4 to provison with the public IPv4 address and port set.
      
      However, in many networks, the configuration information may be
      stored in Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers
      while user configuration is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway
      (BNG).  This document defines a Remote Authentication Dial In User
      Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries lightweight 4over6
      configuration information from AAA server to BNG.

  "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) Option for
  Lightweight 4over6", Chongfeng Xie, Qiong Sun, Yiu Lee, Tina Tsou, Peng
  Wu, 2013-07-08, <draft-sun-softwire-lw4over6-dhcpv6-00.txt>

      Lightweight 4over6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is an extension to
      DS-Lite which moves the Network Address Translation function from the
      DS-Lite AFTR to the B4.  It can be deployed in a DS-Lite network to
      gradually reduce the load of Carrier Grade NAT in the AFTR.  However,
      when DS-Lite and lw4over6 co-exist in the same network, B4 elemtns
      and lwB4 elements may want to signal the DHCPv6 server the type of
      AFTR (i.e.  AFTR or lwAFTR) they request.  In this memo, a new DHCPv6
      option is proposed for lwB4 element to request the IPv6 address of
      its corresponding lwAFTR.

  <draft-oiwa-precis-httpauthprep-00.txt,.ps,.pdf>

      This document describes how to handle Unicode strings representing
      user names and passwords for HTTP authentication.

  "IPv6 Roaming Behavior Analysis", Gang Chen, Hui Deng, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-chen-v6ops-ipv6-roaming-analysis-00.txt>

      This document intends to enumerate failed cases when a IPv6
      subscriber roams into visited network areas.  The investigations on
      those failed cases reveal the causes in order to notice improper
      configurations, equipment's incomplete functions or inconsistent IPv6
      strategy.

  "Radius Attributes for Stateful NAT64", Gang Chen, David Binet,
  2013-07-08, <draft-chen-behave-nat64-radius-extension-00.txt>

      This document proposes new radius attributes for stateful NAT64.  The
      extensions are used to provide geo-location services with an exact
      IPv6 soruce address.  The message flow to deliver the NAT64 binding
      information between radius clients and servers is also described.
      Therefore, accurate location could be traced out depending on the
      radius method.

  "Multi-Topology Extension for the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol
  version 2 (OLSRv2)", Christopher Dearlove, Thomas Clausen, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-dearlove-manet-olsrv2-multitopology-01.txt>

      This specification describes an extension to the Optimized Link State
      Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) to support multiple routing
      topologies, while retaining interoperability with OLSRv2 routers that
      do not implement this extension.

  "Routing MPR and Other Extensions for the Optimized Link State Routing
  Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)", Christopher Dearlove, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-dearlove-manet-olsrv2-extensions-00.txt>

      This specification describes an extension to the Optimized Link State
      Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) to improve the selection of
      routing MPRs.  Other considerations for extending OLSRv2 and the
      MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) are also given.

  "ISIS Protocol Extension For Building Distribution Trees", Lucy Yong,
  Hao Weiguo, Donald Eastlake, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-yong-isis-ext-4-distribution-tree-00.txt>

      This document proposes an IS-IS protocol extension for automatically
      building bi-directional distribution trees to transport multi-
      destination traffic in an IP network.

  "IPv6 RA Options for Next Hop Routes", Behcet Sarikaya, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-sarikaya-6man-rfc4191bis-00.txt>

      This proposes an update on RFC 4191 in order to define new Router
      Advertisement options for configuring next hop routes on the mobile
      or fixed nodes.  Using these options, an operator can easily
      configure nodes with multiple interfaces (or otherwise multi-homed)
      to enable them to select the routes to a destination.  Each option is
      defined together with definitions of host and router behaviors.

  "DHCP Options for Configuring Multicast Addresses in VXLAN", Behcet
  Sarikaya, Frank Xia, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-sarikaya-dhc-vxlan-multicast-01.txt>

      This document defines DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options for assigning
      multicast addresses for the Tunnel End Point in the Virtual
      eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN) environments.  New DHCP options
      are defined which allow a VXLAN Tunnel End Point to request any
      source multicast address for the newly created virtual machine, the
      address of the Rendezvous Point (RP) and possibly address(es) for the
      virtual machine.

  "RPKI Validation Reconsidered", Geoff Huston, George Michaelson,
  2013-07-08, <draft-huston-rpki-validation-00.txt>

      This document reviews the certificate validation procedure specified
      in RFC6487 and highlights aspects of operational management of
      certificates in the RPKI in response to the movement of resources
      across registries, and the associated actions of Certification
      Authorities to maintain certification of resources during this
      movement.  The document describes an alternative validation procedure
      that reduces the operational impact of certificate management during
      resource movement.

  "mLDP in-band signalling Wildcard encoding", IJsbrand Wijnands, 
  arkadiy.gulko@thomsonreuters.com, Uwe Joorde, Jeff Tantsura, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-wijnands-mpls-mldp-in-band-wildcard-encoding-00.txt>

      Documents [RFC6826] and [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-mldp-vrf-in-band-signaling]
      define a solution to splice an IP multicast tree together with a
      multipoint LSP in the global or VRF context.  In these drafts the
      Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol (mLDP) Opaque TLV encodings
      have been documented for Source specific and Bidir IP multicast
      trees.  For each IP multicast tree a multipoint LSP is created.
      There are scenarios where it is beneficial to support shared trees
      and allow aggregation such that fewer multipoint LSPs are created in
      the network.  This document defines wildcard encodings to be used for
      the Source or Group fields of the existing opaque encodings.  With
      the wildcard encoding it is possible to create a single multipoint
      LSP that is used to represent *all* sources for a given multicast
      group or *all* groups for a given source.

  "Updating Additional Data related to an Emergency Call using Subscribe/
  Notify", Brian Rosen, 2013-07-08,
  <draft-rosen-ecrit-addldata-subnot-00.txt>

      Additional Call Data is sent in a SIP Call-Info header or in a
      provided-by element of a PIDF-LO.  Sometimes, the information needs
      to be updated while an emergency call is in progress.  It is best for
      the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) to control the timing and
      frequency of updates.  This document describes a SIP Subscribe/Notify
      Package to supply updates of Additional Call Data.

  "Protocol Independent Encoding for Signaling Flow Characteristics",
  Toerless Eckert, Anca Zamfir, Amine Choukir, Charles Eckel, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-choukir-tsvwg-flow-metadata-encoding-01.txt,.pdf>

      This document describes a protocol independent encoding for flow
      characteristics (a.k.a. metadata).  A flow is defined as a set of IP
      packets passing through a network in a given direction.  All packets
      belonging to a particular flow have a set of common properties (e.g.
      IP, port, transport).  Flow metadata exposes key characteristics of
      the flow such as the originating application, the type of media in
      use (e.g.  audio, video) and others as defined in
      [I-D.eckert-intarea-flow-metadata-framework].  The flow
      characteristics are expressed in terms of information elements.
      These information elements are signaled either out of band or in band
      but always along the same path of the flow associated with the
      application.
      
      [I-D.eckert-intarea-flow-metadata-framework] defines the overall
      framework for flow metadata and the definition of the flow
      characteristics, whereas this document captures the encoding of these
      characteristics.  The mapping of flow metadata encoding to different
      signaling protocols is outside the scope of this document.

  "MSRP over WebRTC data channels", Jerome Marcon, Richard Ejzak,
  2013-07-08, <draft-marcon-msrp-over-webrtc-data-channels-00.txt>

      The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group is
      charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich
      communication using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-
      browsers.  For the support of data communication, the RTCWeb working
      group has in particular defined the concept of bi-directional data
      channels over SCTP, where each data channel might be used to
      transport other protocols, called sub-protocols.  This document
      specifies how the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) can be
      instantiated as a WebRTC data channel sub-protocol, using the SDP
      offer/exchange to negotiate out-of-band the sub-protocol specific
      parameters.  Two network configurations are documented: a WebRTC end-
      to-end configuration (connecting two MSRP over data channel
      endpoints), and a gateway configuration (connecting an MSRP over data
      channel endpoint with an MSRP over TCP endpoint).

  "Use of "Roles" in CLUE", Christian Groves, Weiwei Yang, Roni Even,
  2013-07-08, <draft-groves-clue-role-clarifications-00.txt>

      There have been recent discussions on the CLUE and DISPATCH mailing
      lists about "roles" associated with multimedia conferences.  From the
      discussions it was apparent that there is some confusion as to what
      the current defined roles actually imply and that people had
      different understanding of the meaning and scope of the term "role".
      This draft seeks to identify the various "roles" that may be
      associated with a multimedia conference and to provide a grouping and
      nomenclature for further discussions on this topic.
      
      Specific to CLUE this draft proposes a number of attributes to be
      able to clearly identify the various roles that may be associated
      with a media capture.

  "Node Protecting R-LFA and Manageability",  psarkar@juniper.net, Hannes
  Gredler, Shraddha Hegde, Harish Raghuveer, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-psarkar-rtgwg-rlfa-node-protection-01.txt>

      The loop-free alternates computed following the current Remote-LFA
      [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa] specification gaurantees only link-
      protection.  The resulting Remote-LFA nexthops (also called PQ-
      nodes), may not gaurantee node-protection for all destinations being
      protected by it.
      
      This document describes procedures for determining if a given PQ-node
      provides node-protection for a specific destination or not.  The
      document also shows how the same procedure can be utilised for
      collection of complete characteristics for alternate paths.
      Knowledge about the characteristics of all alternate path is
      precursory to apply operator defined policy for eliminating paths not
      fitting constraints.

  "Dynamic Stateless GRE tunnel", Li Xue, Dayong Guo, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-xue-dhc-dynamic-gre-00.txt>

      Specifically, WiFi has emerged as an important access technology for
      Multiple Service Operator (MSO) and mobile service provider.  For
      mobile service provider, WiFi is preferred as a trusted access
      technology for service.  It has became important to provide simple
      transition method expected for service via WiFi access.  For example,
      tunnelling on the customer side aims at conveying WiFi service
      between a hotspot and the Service Gateway.  GRE tunnel is an
      increasingly popular encapsulation choice because of simple
      encapsulation and easy implementation, especially in aforementioned
      environments.  However, manual configuration is not suitable if there
      are large numbers of the end-points of GRE tunnels.  This document
      proposes a dynamic-configured stateless GRE tunnel, which does not
      modify encapsulation format of GRE, but adds signaling for tunnel
      parameters discovery, such as address, GRE key etc.

  "One Administrative Domain", Jim Uttaro, Saikat Ray, Prodosh Mohapatra,
  2013-07-09, <draft-uttaro-idr-oad-00.txt>

      The notional premise that different Autonomous Systems belong to
      different administrative authorities may not always hold.  A single
      administrative authority may instantiate services on and across
      multiple ASes.  A customer accessing those services can reasonably
      expect that attributes such as LOCAL_PREF that influence routing be
      applicable even across different ASes.  This document describes a
      mechanism to do so.

  "Flow Metadata Signaling with RSVP", Toerless Eckert, Anca Zamfir, Amine
  Choukir, 2013-07-09, <draft-zamfir-tsvwg-flow-metadata-rsvp-00.txt>

      This specification proposes RSVP protocol extensions for signaling
      flow metadata attributes.

  "PIM neighbor selection with ECMP routes", Bharat Joshi, Jithesh
  Kaveetil, 2013-07-09, <draft-joshi-pim-ecmp-neighbor-select-00.txt>

      A Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) router uses local forwarding
      table to select the upstream PIM neighbor towards the source or
      Rendezvous Point (RP).  A router need to choose one upstream PIM
      neighbor from the list of PIM neighbors if the route for a source or
      RP is an Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) route.  Currently PIM routers
      use vendor specific algorithm to choose one neighbor.  This may lead
      to unnecessary wastage of network resources.  This draft first
      explains the need for a standard algorithm to select a PIM neighbor
      with ECMP route and then suggest such an algorithm.

  "A Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Header Extension for VP8 Temporal
  Layer Information", Adam Fineberg, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-fineberg-avtext-temporal-layer-ext-00.txt>

      This document defines a mechanism by which packets of Real-Time
      Tranport Protocol (RTP) video streams encoded with the VP8 codec can
      indicate, in an RTP header extension, the temporal layer information
      about the frame encoded in the RTP packet.  This information can be
      used in a middlebox performing bandwidth management of streams
      without requiring it to decrypt the streams.

  "Use Cases and Architecture of Central Controlled IP RAN", Katherine
  Zhao, Jiehui Hu, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-khy-rtgwg-central-controlled-ipran-00.txt>

      This document introduces the requirements and use cases for IP RAN
      (Radio Access Networks). To support the requirements, the document
      provides an architecture with centralized control plane as well as
      separation of control plane and data plane.  The document also
      describes techniques for IP RAN network initialization and
      construction; interfacing to management plane and third party
      applications.  This document can be used as a guideline for central
      controlled IP RAN design and development.

  "DNS A Record Filtering for the migration from dual stack networks to
  IPv6 only networks.", Hiroaki Hazeyama, Tomohiro Ishihara, Osamu
  Nakamura, 2013-07-09, <draft-hazeyama-sunset4-dns-a-filter-00.txt>

      Filtering out of A records of a DNS response on a DNS proxy, we call
      it ``DNS A record filtering'', is an effective and efficient solution
      as a smooth migration to IPv6 only networks.  DNS A record filtering
      can mitigate fallback problems of dual stack nodes on IPv6 only
      environment.  This memo mentions the components of the DNS A record
      filter solution, procedure of DNS queries and refers current issues.

  "BGP as an MVPN PE-CE Protocol", Keyur Patel, Yakov Rekhter, Eric Rosen,
  2013-07-09, <draft-keyupate-l3vpn-mvpn-pe-ce-00.txt>

      When a Service Provider offers BGP/MPLS IP VPN service to its
      customers, RFCs 6513 and 6514 describe protocols and procedures that
      the Service Provider can use in order to carry the customer's IP
      multicast traffic from one customer site to others.  BGP can be used
      to carry customer multicast routing information from one Provider
      Edge (PE) router to another, but it is assumed that PIM is running on
      the interface between a Customer Edge (CE) router and a PE router.
      This document specifies protocols and procedures that, under certain
      conditions, allow customer multicast routing information to carried
      between PE and CE via BGP.  This can eliminate the need to run PIM on
      the PE-CE interfaces, potentially eliminating the need to run PIM on
      the PE routers at all.

  "IPv4 Address Literal in URL", Osamu Nakamura, Hiroaki Hazeyama, Yukito
  Ueno, Akira Kato, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-osamu-v6ops-ipv4-literal-in-url-00.txt>

      In an IPv6-only environment with DNS64/NAT64 based translation
      service, there is no way to get access a URL whose domain name part
      includes an IPv4 address literal.  This memo discusses a few methods
      to rewrite the URL on an IPv6-only host so that the URL is accessible
      from the IPv6-only host.

  "Capability Announcement and AR Discovery in CAPWAP Control and Data
  Channel Separation", Li Xue, Zongpeng Du, Dapeng Liu, Rong Zhang, John
  Kaippallimalil, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-xue-opsawg-capwap-separation-capability-00.txt>

      In a centralized IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
      architecture, the Access Controller (AC) does not have the
      intelligence to aggregate all the wireless frames. In addition,
      increasing amounts of traffic handled by each access point would
      require even more processing at an AC.  Thus it is normal in an
      existing operator's network for the WTPs to forward the wireless
      frames directly to AR to avoid overloading the AC.  In this scenario,
      CAPWAP Control Channel and CAPWAP Data Channel are separated from
      each other.  This document provides extensions to CAPWAP for the
      split scenario where CAPWAP Control and Data Channel are separated.

  "Security UDT using TLS/DTLS", Tatikayala Gopal, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-tsg-tls-udt-sec-00.txt>

      This document describes about providing security to UDP Based Data
      Transfer (UDT) protocol. UDT is application level protocol built on
      the top of UDP, which effectively utilizes bandwidth in the high
      speed network as compared with TCP. UDT relies on the above layer for
      security because of absence of in-build security mechanisms. This
      document proposes the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS)/Datagram
      Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for securing the UDT protocol.

  "Stateless user-plane architecture for virtualized EPC (vEPC)", Satoru
  Matsushima, Ryuji Wakikawa, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-matsushima-stateless-uplane-vepc-01.txt>

      We envision a new mobile architecture for the future Evolved Packet
      Core (EPC).  The new architecture is designed to support the
      virtualization scheme called NFV (Network Function Virtualization).
      In our architecture, the user plane of EPC is decoupled from the
      control-plane and uses routing information to forward packets of
      mobile nodes.  Although the EPC control plane will run on hypervisor,
      our proposal does not modify the signaling of the EPC control plane.
      The benefits of our architecture are 1) scalability, 2) flexibility
      and 3) Manageability.  How to run the EPC control plane on NFV is out
      of our focus in this document.

  "CLUE protocol (??)", Roberta Presta, Simon Romano, 2013-07-10,
  <draft-presta-clue-protocol-00.txt>

      This is a work-in-progress draft aimed at shedding light on the
      application-level protocol associated with the creation and
      management of a CLUE-enabled telepresence session between a Media
      Consumer and a Media Provider.  The draft sketches the high-level
      interactions occurring between the above mentioned entities, as well
      as depicts the state transitions occurring at both ends during a
      telepresence session.

  "Federated Filesystem Security Addendum", Chuck Lever, 2013-07-11,

      missing from existing FedFS proposed standards.

  "Free from Using Zone Identifier for IPv6 Link-Local Address", Hiroshi
  Kitamura, Shingo Ata, Masayuki Murata, 2013-07-10,
  <draft-kitamura-ipv6-zoneid-free-00.txt>

      This document describes how end users can become free from using
      zone identifiers for IPv6 link-local addresses.
      
      When users deal with IPv6 link-local addresses, it is thought that
      it is mandatory thing to specify accompanied zone identifiers. For
      end users, however, it is troublesome and nuisance thing to do it.
      Because it is very hard for normal end users to find appropriate
      zone identifiers for this purpose.
      
      From another viewpoint, the usage of IPv6 link-local addresses
      accompanied with zone identifiers is quite different from the usage
      of traditional global addresses, many problems are caused and new
      specifications are required to fix these problems.
      
      This document explores and describes a new mechanism that makes end
      users free from using zone identifiers for IPv6 link-local
      addresses. In order to achieve the mechanism, a new notion table
      that is called "Link-Local Route Cache" is introduced.
      
      This method is upper compatible with the current mechanism and
      harmless to the existing communications. By adding small
      improvement to neighbor discovery implementation, "Link-Local Route
      Cache" is easily implemented.
      
      With this method, end users will be released from using nuisance
      zone identifiers for IPv6 link-local addresses.

  "TLS sessions in SIP using DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities
  (DANE) TLSA records", oej, 2013-07-10, <draft-johansson-dane-sip-00.txt>

      Use of TLS in the SIP protocol is defined in multiple documents,
      starting with RFC 3261.  The actual verification that happens when
      setting up a SIP TLS connection to a SIP server based on a SIP URI is
      described in detail in RFC 5922 - SIP Domain Certificates.
      
      In this document, an alternative method is defined, using DNS-Based
      Authentication of Named Entities (DANE).  By looking up TLSA DNS
      records and using DNSsec protection of the required queries,
      including lookups for NAPTR and SRV records, a SIP Client can verify
      the identity of the TLS SIP server in a different way, matching on
      the SRV host name in the X.509 PKIX certificate instead of the SIP
      domain.  This provides more scalability in hosting solutions and make
      it easier to use standard CA certificates (if needed at all).
      
      This document updates RFC 5922.

  "Usecases of MPLS Global Label", Zhenbin Li, Quintin Zhao, Tianle Yang,
  2013-07-10, <draft-li-mpls-global-label-usecases-00.txt>

      As the SDN(Service-Driven Network) technology develops, MPLS global
      label has been proposed again for new solutions.  The document
      proposes possible usecases of MPLS global label.  MPLS global label
      can be used for identification of the location, the service and the
      network in different application scenarios.  From these usecases we
      can see that no matter SDN or traditional application scenarios, the
      new solutions based on MPLS global label can gain advantage over the
      existing solutions to facilitate service provisions.

  "Active-active access in NVO3 network", Hao Weiguo, Li Yizhou,
  2013-07-10, <draft-hao-l2vpn-evpn-nvo3-active-active-00.txt>

      E-VPN can be used as a control plane protocol for NVO3 network. In All-
      Active
      access scenario, loop & echo forwarding prevention among multi-
      homed NVEs relies
      on "Split horizon" filtering mechanism. ESI MPLS label
      is leveraged to perform
      split horizon filtering in MPLS based EVPN
      network. In VXLAN or NVGRE
      encapsulation based overlay network, no MPLS
      is used. Therefore a new method is
      introduced in this document to
      achieve split horizon filtering in non-MPLS overlay
      network. Data plane
      of the overlay network is extended with a LAGID field. The
      function of
      LAGID is similar to ESI MPLS Label in [EVPN]. It is used to identify
      each Ethernet segment(ES) on each NVE.

  "A Framework of MPLS Global Label", Zhenbin Li, Quintin Zhao, Tianle
  Yang, 2013-07-10, <draft-li-mpls-global-label-framework-00.txt>

      The document defines the framework of MPLS global label including:
      representation of MPLS global label, process of control plane for
      MPLS global label, and process of data plane for MPLS global label.

  "Efficient XML Interchange Capability for NETCONF", Robert Varga,
  2013-07-10, <draft-varga-netconf-exi-capability-00.txt>

      The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to
      install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices
      via exchange of XML messages in textual representation.  Efficient
      XML Interchange (EXI) is a W3C-recommended binary representation of
      XML Information Set, which is more efficient from both CPU and
      bandwidth utilization perspective.  This document defines a
      capability-based extension to the NETCONF protocol that allows peers
      to agree to exchange protocol messages using EXI encoding.

  "BGP Path Marking", Camilo Cardona, Pierre Francois, Saikat Ray, Keyur
  Patel, Paolo Lucente, Prodosh Mohapatra, 2013-07-10,
  <draft-bgp-path-marking-00.txt>

      The potential advertisement of non-best paths by a BGP speaker
      supporting the add-path or the best-external extensions makes it
      difficult for other BGP speakers to identify the paths that have been
      selected as best by those who advertise them.  This information is
      required for proper operation of some applications.  Towards that
      end, this document proposes marking the paths using extended
      communities that encode the path type.

  "Energy Reporting Framework", Bruce Nordman, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-nordman-eman-er-framework-01.txt,.pdf>

      Managing energy consumption of devices presents new challenges and
      issues.  The EMAN Requirements draft identifies essential
      capabilities needed to accomplish this.  This draft describes how an
      energy management system can use EMAN to gather and interpret data
      from individual devices, and how some of the Requirements are
      implemented in the model.  This document focuses on Energy Reporting,
      though acknowledges and fully includes the limited control functions
      specified in the Requirements draft.  Topics addressed in detail
      include the topology of power distribution, reporting mechanisms, and
      the various roles of devices, power interfaces, and components.

  "Advertising Global Labels Using IGP", KuiKe Building, Mach Chen,
  2013-07-11, <draft-xu-rtgwg-global-label-adv-00.txt>

      Segment Routing (SR) [SR-ARCH] is a new MPLS paradigm in which each
      SR-capable router is required to independently advertise global MPLS
      labels for its attached prefixes using IGP [SR-ISIS-EXT][SR-OSPF-EXT].
      One major challenge associated with such label advertisement
      mechanism is how to avoid a given global MPLS label from being
      allocated by different routers to different prefixes. Although manual
      allocation can address such label allocation collision problem, it is
      error-prone and therefore may not be suitable for large SR network
      environments. This document proposes an alternative approach for
      advertising global labels without any risk of label allocation
      collision.

  "Use Cases of Route Reflection based Traffic Steering", Mach Chen,
  Shunwan Zhuang, Yongqing Zhu, Subin Wang, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-chen-idr-rr-based-traffic-steering-usecase-00.txt>

      Route Reflection based Traffic Steering (RRTS) is an idea that
      leverages the BGP route reflection mechanism to realize traffic
      steering in the network, therefore the operators can conduct their
      traffic to transmit/receive through specific nodes, domains and/or
      planes as demand.  This document introduces the requirements and use
      cases of RRTS.

  "NETCONF rpc-error extension", Shouchuan Yang, Xiaofeng Ji, Tina Tsou,

  "Signaling Color Label Switched Paths Using LDP", Santiago Alvarez,
  Kamran Raza, Sami Boutros, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-alvarez-mpls-ldp-color-lsp-00.txt>

      This document describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol
      (LDP) to signal a switching preference in the presence of multiple
      paths.  A label switched router (LSR) can associate locally a color
      with one or more downstream paths or links, and signal a label path
      per color to upstream LSRs.  Based on local policy, LSRs can select
      between these color LSPs to implement a forwarding preference on a
      downstream LSR.  An egress LSR may influence the signaling decision
      of other LSRs by signaling interest in specific colors.

  "sacm: Alternate Architecture", Russ Housley, Sean Turner, 2013-07-15,

      This document proposes and alternate architecture for sacm (a
      proposed working group at the time this draft was submitted).

  "Using the Publish-Subscribe Model in the Interface to the Routing
  System", Ken Beck, Nancy Cam-Winget, David McGrew, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-camwinget-i2rs-pubsub-sec-00.txt>

      In the Publish-Subscribe model, subscribers express their interest in
      an event, or a pattern of events, and are subsequently notified of
      any event generated by a publisher that matches their registered
      interest.  The model is well suited for communication in large-scale
      and loosely coupled distributed systems.  This document describes how
      the model fits into Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) and
      Software Defined Networking (SDN) architectures, and analyzes its
      advantages, its security requirements, and its use in providing
      security within I2RS.

  "sacm: Asset Identifier", Russ Housley, Sean Turner, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-handt-sacm-asset-identifiers-00.txt>

      This document examines the asset identifiers available for sacm and
      it proposes that OIDs (Object Identifiers) be selected as the asset
      identifier format.

  "An IPv6 Distributed Client Mobility Management approach using existing
  mechanisms", Carlos Bernardos, Antonio de la Oliva, Fabio Giust,
  2013-07-11, <draft-bernardos-dmm-cmip-00.txt>

      The use of centralized mobility management approaches -- such as
      Mobile IPv6 -- poses some difficulties to operators of current and
      future networks, due to the expected large number of mobile users and
      their exigent demands.  All this has triggered the need for
      distributed mobility management alternatives, that alleviate
      operators' concerns allowing for cheaper and more efficient network
      deployments.
      
      This draft describes a possible way of achieving a distributed
      mobility behavior with Client Mobile IP, based on Mobile IPv6 and the
      use of Cryptographic Generated Addresses.

  "Layer 4-7 Service Chain problem statement", Linda Dunbar, Donald
  Eastlake, 2013-07-11, <draft-dunbar-l4-l7-sc-problem-statement-00.txt>

      This draft analyzes the taxonomy of Layer 4-7 Services and gives
      two examples of Layer 4-7 service chain, one from a traffic
      steering perspective and another one from a Layer 7 perspective.
      The intent is to emphasize their unique issues and challenges.

  "The I-JSON Message Format", Tim Bray, 2013-07-11,

      interoperability and increase confidence that software can process it
      successfully with predictable results.

  "OSPF Routing Extension for links with variable discrete bandwidth", Hao
  Long, Min Ye, Greg Mirsky, Alessandro D'Alessandro, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-long-ccamp-ospf-availability-extension-00.txt>

      Packet switching network may contain links with variable discrete
      bandwidth, e.g., copper, radio, etc. The bandwidth of such link may
      change discretely in reaction to changing external environment.
      Availability is typically used for describing such links during
      network planning. This document describes an extension for OSPF
      routing for route computation in a Packet Switched Network (PSN)
      which contains link with variable discrete bandwidth by introducing
      an optional availability sub-TLV.

  "JSON Activity Streams 2.0", James Snell, 2013-07-29,

  "Connecting IPv6 Multicast Islands over IPv4 MPLS Using IPv6 Provider
  Edge Routers (6PE)", Zhenbin Li, Shunwan Zhuang, Hui Ni, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-li-idr-mcast-6pe-00.txt>

      This document defines a new Network Layer Reachability Information
      (NLRI), called as the MCAST-6PE NLRI.  The MCAST-6PE NLRI is used to
      interconnect IPv6 C-Multicast islands over a Multiprotocol Label
      Switching (MPLS)-enabled IPv4 cloud.  This approach relies on IPv6
      Provider Edge routers (6PE), which can exchange the IPv6 C-Multicast
      reachability information transparently over the core using the
      Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) over IPv4.  This
      document describes the BGP encodings and procedures for exchanging
      the information elements required by IPv6 Multicast in 6PE.  MPLS-
      based Service Providers may use the 6PE Multicast mechanism to
      provide IPv6 Multicast service for customers.

  "Public Key-Based Kerberos Cross Realm Path Traversal Protocol", Nico
  Williams, 2013-07-11, <draft-williams-kitten-krb5-pkcross-01.txt>

      This document specifies a protocol for obtaining cross-realm Kerberos
      tickets using existing, related protocols.  The resulting protocol
      has a number of desirable security properties, including privacy
      protection for the user relative to their home realm's
      infrastructure, as well a support for leap-of-faith trust
      establishment, and automated cross-realm keying.  This protocol
      allows Kerberos to scale to large numbers of realms.

      The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of
      Links)_protocol provides support for flow level multi-pathing with
      rapid failover for both unicast and multi-destination traffic in
      networks with arbitrary topology and link technology between TRILL
      switches. Active-active at the TRILL edge is the extension, in so far
      as practical, of these characteristics to end stations that are
      multiply connected to a TRILL campus. This informational document
      discusses some of the high level problems to be overcome in providing
      active-active at the TRILL edge.

  "Seamless MPLS for Mobile Backhaul", Zhenbin Li, Lei Li, Manuel Morillo,
  Tianle Yang, 2013-07-11, <draft-li-mpls-seamless-mpls-mbb-00.txt>

      This document introduces the framework of Seamless MPLS to integrate
      the mobile backhaul network with the core network.  New requirements
      of Seamless MPLS for mobile backhaul networks are defined and
      corresponding solutions are proposed.

  "An Identity Key-based and Effective Signature for Origin-Unknown
  Types", Hadriel Kaplan, 2013-07-11, <draft-kaplan-stir-ikes-out-00.txt>

      This document describes a mechanism and format for signing source
      identity information of communication requests, in a manner capable
      of crossing multiple communication protocol types - even if the
      origin's protocol type is unknown.  This is useful for providing
      E.164 and other forms of Caller-ID reputability for various
      communication protocols, such as SIP, XMPP, WebRTC, H.323, and
      SS7/ISUP.

  "Network as a service requirement in cloud datacenter", Chen Li, Rong
  Gu, 2013-07-11, <draft-li-nvo3-clouddatacenter-requirement-00.txt>

      Forced Switch. This document updates RFC 4427.

  "BGP attribute for North-Bound Distribution of Traffic Engineering (TE)
  performance Metric", Wenson Wu, Wang Danhua, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-wu-idr-te-pm-bgp-01.txt>

      In order to populate network performance information like link
      latency, latency variation and packet loss into Traffic Engineering
      Database(TED) and ALTO server, this document describes extensions to
      BGP protocol, that can be used to distribute network performance
      information (such as link delay, delay variation, packet loss,
      residual bandwidth, and available bandwidth, link utilization,
      channel throughput).

  "SSH File Transfer Protocol", S Moonesamy, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-moonesamy-secsh-filexfer-00.txt>

      The SSH File Transfer Protocol provides secure file transfer
      functionality over any reliable data stream.  It is the standard file
      transfer protocol for use with the SSH2 protocol.  This document
      describes the file transfer protocol and its interface to the SSH2
      protocol suite.

  "Network Address Port Group Translator", Wei Meng, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-meng-behave-napgt-01.txt>

      Currently, if an internal server and hosts are behind NAT, they
      cannot share a global IP address except adding lots of static NAPT
      rule configuration.  Because if a server wants to provide a service
      by constant port(i.e. HTTP and FTP) , the destination port of packet
      sent by an external client should not be changed when it crosses NAT.
      This document specifies a new method to assign NAPT global address
      and port, aiming to solve the problem that internal servers and hosts
      cannot share less global IP addresses.

  "ConEx Crediting and Auditing", David Wagner, Mirja Kuehlewind,
  2013-07-12, <draft-wagner-conex-credit-00.txt>

      Congestion Exposure (ConEx) is a mechanism by which senders inform
      the network about the congestion encountered by previous packets on
      the same flow.  In order to make ConEx information useful, reliable
      auditing is necessary to provide a strong incentive to declare ConEx
      information honestly.  However, there is always a delay between
      congestion events and the respective ConEx signal at the audit.  To
      avoid state and complex Round-Trip Time estimations at the audit, in
      [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech] it is proposed to use credit signals
      sent in advance to cover potential congestion in the next feedback
      delay duration.  Unfortunately, introducing credit does not provide
      incentives to honestly report congestion.  This document lists
      potential issues regarding the proposed crediting and discusses
      potential solutions approaches to interpret and handle credits at the
      audit.

  "Implication of 3GPP Link Characteristics on Lightweight IP Design",
  Yuanchen Ma, Zehn Cao, 2013-07-12, <draft-ma-lwig-3gpplink-imply-00.txt>

      In 3GPP Release 12, the work item Machine Type Communication (MTC) is
      specifying low cost terminals for Machine to Machine communications.
      Since IETF has already developed a suite of protocols for device
      communication, it is useful to analyze the limitation of 3GPP MTC and
      the impact on the implementation of IETF protocol suite.  This
      document analyzes the feature of 3GPP MTC and the impact on light
      weight protocol implementation for the MTC terminals.

  "CoAP over WebSockets", Teemu Savolainen, Klaus Hartke, Bilhanan
  Silverajan, 2013-07-12, <draft-savolainen-core-coap-websockets-00.txt>

      This document specifies how to retrieve and update CoAP resources
      using CoAP requests and responses over the WebSocket Protocol.

  "A Format for Embedding Code in RFC", Riccardo Bernardini, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-bernardini-embedded-code-00.txt>

      Some RFC need to include some code or some kind of data like test
      vectors.  Extracting the code or the data from the RFC "by hand" is
      possible, but tiresome and prone to errors, especially if the portion
      to be extracted is long or comprises many files.  This document
      describes a format that can be used to embed code or data in an RFC,
      so that it can be extract by a software, while preserving the
      readibility of the embedded text.

  "An Out-Of-Band Setup Protocol For RPKI Production Services", Rob
  Austein, 2013-07-12, <draft-austein-sidr-rpki-oob-setup-00.txt>

      This note describes a simple out-of-band protocol to ease setup of
      the RPKI provisioning and publication protocols between two parties.
      The protocol is encoded in a small number of XML messages, which can
      be passed back and forth by any mutually agreeable secure means.
      
      This setup protocol is not part of the provisioning or publication
      protocol, rather, it is intended to simplify configuration of these
      protocols by setting up relationships and exchanging BPKI keying
      material.

  "Extensions to Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering
  (RSVP-TE) for Error Notication in Generalized Multiprotocol Label
  Switching (GMPLS) User-Network Interface (UNI)", Zafar Ali, George
  Swallow, Matt Hartley, Clarence Filsfils, Kenji Kumaki, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-ali-ccamp-gmpls-uni-error-notification-00.txt>

      There are many scenarios in which extensions to Resource ReserVation
      Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) are required for error
      notication in Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
      User-Network Interface (UNI). This document outlines these scenarios
      and specifies the required extensions to RSVP-TE. Although the
      GMPLS-UNI reference model is used to describe requirements and
      solutions in the document, the proposed extensions are equally
      applicable to other deployment scenarios such as inter-domain RSVP-
      TE.

  "A Near Term Solution for Home IP Networking (HIPnet)", Chris
  Grundemann, Chris Donley, John Brzozowski, Lee Howard, Victor Kuarsingh,
  2013-07-12, <draft-grundemann-hipnet-00.txt>

      Home networks are becoming more complex.  With the launch of new
      services such as home security, IP video, Smart Grid, etc., many
      Service Providers are placing additional IPv4/IPv6 routers on the
      subscriber network.  This document describes a self-configuring home
      router that is capable of operating in such an environment, and that
      requires no user interaction to configure it.  Compliant with draft-
      ietf-homenet-arch, it uses existing protocols in new ways without the
      need for a routing protocol.

  "Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) and MANET
  Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) Extension TLVs", Christopher
  Dearlove, Thomas Clausen, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-dearlove-manet-nhdp-olsrv2-tlv-extension-02.txt>

      This specification describes extensions to definitions of TLVs used
      by the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) and
      the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP), to increase their
      abilities to accommodate protocol extensions.  This document updates
      OLSRv2 and RFC6130.

  "Routing MPR Optimization for the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol
  version 2 (OLSRv2)", Christopher Dearlove, Thomas Clausen, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-dearlove-manet-olsrv2-rmpr-optimization-00.txt>

      This specification updates the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol
      version 2 (OLSRv2) with an optimization to improve the selection of
      routing MPRs.  The optimization retains full interoperability between
      implementations of OLSRv2 with and without this optimization.

  "OSPF Extensions to Support Maximally Redundant Trees", Alia Atlas,
  Shraddha Hegde,  cbowers@juniper.net, Jeff Tantsura, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-atlas-ospf-mrt-00.txt>

      This document specifies extensions to OSPF to support the distributed
      computation of Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT).  Some example uses of
      the MRTs include IP/LDP Fast-Reroute and global protection or live-
      live for multicast traffic.  The extensions indicate what MRT
      profile(s) each router supports.  Different MRT profiles can be
      defined to support different uses and to allow transitioning of
      capabilities.  An extension is introduced to flood MRT-Ineligible
      links, due to administrative policy.
      
      The need for a mechanism to allow routers to advertise a worst-case
      FIB compute/install time is well understood for controlling
      convergence.  This specification introduces the Controlled
      Convergence TLV to be carried in the Router Information LSA.

  "LDP Extensions to Support Maximally Redundant Trees", Alia Atlas,
  Kishore Tiruveedhula, Jeff Tantsura, IJsbrand Wijnands, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-atlas-mpls-ldp-mrt-00.txt>

      This document specifies extensions to LDP to support the creation of
      label-switched paths for Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT).  A prime
      use of MRTs is for unicast and multicast IP/LDP Fast-Reroute (MRT-
      FRR).
      
      The sole protocol extension to LDP is simply the ability to advertise
      an MRT Capability.  This document describes that extension and the
      associated behavior expected for LSRs and LERs advertising the MRT
      Capability.
      
      MRT-FRR uses LDP multi-topology extensions and requires three
      different multi-topology IDs to be allocated from the LDP MT-ID
      space.

  "Global Table Multicast with BGP-MVPN Procedures", Jeffrey Zhang,
  Leonard Giuliano, Dante Pacella, Jason Schiller, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-zzhang-l3vpn-mvpn-global-table-mcast-00.txt>

      This document describes a way to implement Global Table Multicast,
      aka Internet Multicast, using BGP encodings and procedures for MVPN
      as specified in [RFC6514].
      
      No protocol modification/extension is required.  This is purely for
      informational and clarifying purposes only.

  "Updates to the Opus Audio Codec", Jean-Marc Valin, Tim Terriberry, Koen
  Vos, 2013-07-12, <draft-valin-codec-opus-update-00.txt>

      This document addresses minor issues that were found in the
      specification of the Opus audio codec in RFC 6716 [RFC6716].

  "Multicast Traceroute for MVPNs", Robert Kebler, Pavan Kurapati,
  2013-07-12, <draft-kebler-kurapati-l3vpn-mvpn-mtrace-00.txt>

      Mtrace is a tool used to troubleshoot issues in a network deploying
      Multicast service.  When multicast is used within a VPN service
      offering, the base Mtrace specification does not detect the failures.
      This document specifies a method of using multicast traceroute in a
      network offering Multicast in VPN service.

  "A Framework for E-VPN Performance Monitoring", Lianshu Zheng, Zhenbin
  Li, 2013-07-12, <draft-zheng-l2vpn-evpn-pm-framework-00.txt>

      The capability of Ethernet VPN performance monitoring (PM) is
      important to meet the Service Level Agreement(SLA) for the service
      beared.  Since multipoint-to-point or multipoint-to-multipoint
      (MP2MP) network model applies, flow identifying is a big challenge
      for E-VPN PM.  This document specifies the framework and mechanisms
      for the application of E-VPN PM.

  "Monitoring Dual Stack/IPv6-only Networks and Services", Arturo Servin,
  Mariela Rocha, 2013-07-15, <draft-servin-v6ops-monitor-ds-ipv6-01.txt>

      This document describes a set of recommendations and guidelines to
      help operators to monitor dual stack and IPv6-only networks.  The
      document describes how to monitor these networks using SNMP, Flow
      Analyzers and other means.

  "Multicast State Advertisement in E-VPN", Zhenbin Li, Junlin Zhang,
  2013-07-13, <draft-li-l2vpn-evpn-mcast-state-ad-00.txt>

      The document defines a new extended community to advertise the active
      or inactive state for multicast along with the Inclusive Multicast
      Ethernet Tag route or Ethernet A-D route in E-VPN.  The multicast
      state advertised can help optimization of multicast process in E-VPN
      to reduce unnecessary traffic replication for the broadcast, unknown
      unicast and multicast (BUM) traffic.

  "Secure Transport for PCEP", Diego Lopez, Oscar de Dios, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-lopez-pcp-pceps-00.txt>

      The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) defines
      the mechanisms for the communication between a client and a PCE, or
      among PCEs.  This document describe the usage of Transport Layer
      Security to enhance PCEP security, hence the PCEPS acronym proposed
      for it.  The additional security mechanisms are provided by the
      transport protocol supporting PCEP, and therefore they do not affect
      its flexibility and extensibility.

  "Request Interface for CDN Interconnection", Taesang Choi, Young-Il Seo,
  Laboratory KT, Jongmin Lee, Ja-Ryeong Koo, John Shinn, June-koo Rhee,
  2013-07-13, <draft-choi-cdni-req-intf-00.txt>

      This document specifies the request interface between a CDN end-user
      and an upstream CDN or downstream CDN to request CDN request routing
      redirection or URI signing.  It specifies the CDNI Request Interface
      information elements and the actual protocol for exchanging them.

  "GRE-in-UDP Encapsulation for Service Chaining", Lucy Yong, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-yong-gre-in-udp-encap-4-service-chaining-00.txt>

      This document proposes use of the GRE-in-UDP encapsulation [GRE-in-
      UDP] for the packet encapsulation in service chaining.

  "The case of dotless domains", S Moonesamy, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-moonesamy-dotless-domains-00.txt>

      The Charleston Road Registry sent a letter to the Internet
      Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers Board requesting
      permission to expand its application for ".search" to run that
      generic top-level domain (gTLD) as a dotless domain.
      
      This memo discusses about the case of the dotless domains in terms of
      the technical standards published by the IETF.

  "Multiple Provisioning Domain Architecture", Dmitry Anipko, 2013-07-28,
  <draft-anipko-mif-mpvd-arch-02.txt>

      This document is a product of the work of MIF architecture design
      team.  It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues,
      experienced by nodes that can be attached to multiple networks.  The
      framework defines the notion of a Provisioning Domain (PVD) - a
      consistent set of network configuration information, and PVD-aware
      nodes - nodes which learn PVDs from the attached network(s) and/or
      other sources and manage and use multiple PVDs for connectivity
      separately and consistently.

  "Separation of CAPWAP Control and Data Plane: Scenarios, Requirements
  and Solutions", Rong Zhang, Zehn Cao, Hui Deng, Rajesh Pazhyannur, Sri
  Gundavelli, 2013-07-14, <draft-zhang-opsawg-capwap-cds-00.txt>

      This document describes the scenarios and requirements of separating
      CAPWAP Data and Control plane.  This specification provides a CAPWAP
      extension to allow two distinct AC component: AC-DP (AC-Data Plane)
      and AC-CP (AC-Control Plane).  AC-DP handles all user payload with
      the exception of layer 2 management frames between the AC and user
      such as IEEE 802.11 association, authentication, probe, Action Frame.
      AC-CP handles all control messages between the WTP and AC.  In
      addition, the AC-CP wil handle user payload related to layer-2
      management frames such as those mentioned above.

  "Connecting Home Networks via the social network GooglePlus", Cedric
  Dessez, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-dessez-homenet-googleplus-interconnect-01.txt,.pdf>

      This document describes an experimental implementation for connecting
      home networks via a social network.  The social network is used to
      extend the boundary of a single home network to include other home
      networks.  In this way, access to devices or services within a home
      can be granted among home networks based on their relation to one
      another within the social network.

  "Moving Generic Associated Channel registries to a new name space", Loa
  Andersson, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-andersson-mpls-moving-iana-registries-00.txt>

      When RFC 6374 "Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks"
      were developed, the code points allocated by this RFC were mistakenly
      placed within the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
      Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameter registry.  This document creates
      a new dedicated name space for Generic Associated Channel code points
      and move them to a name space their own.

  "MPLS Domain Wide Labels", Robert Raszuk, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-raszuk-mpls-domain-wide-labels-00.txt>

      This document describes a mechanism of using concept of Domain Wide
      MPLS Labels in parallel with any of the existing deployments using
      other label distribution and allocation methods where multi protocol
      label switching paradigm is used for transport.  Specifically it
      defines a new type of context label which can be used to
      differentiate lookup tables when using Domain Wide transport Labels
      from other downstream or upstream assigned transport labels.  The end
      result is creation of clean new label space in data plane allowing
      very easy and smooth migration to the number of applications choosing
      to use Domain Wide MPLS Labels.

  "IPv6 Prefix Sharing Protocol", Marco Spini, Roland Schott, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-schott-fmc-prefix-sharing-protocol-00.txt>

      IPv6 prefix sharing in policy for convergence applications makes it
      impossible to track individual quality of service requirements for
      each host by the policy server.  In order to enable it, we define a
      protocol which is based on the residential gateway sending some
      parameters such as IPv6 addresses of each host (3GPP UE or fixed
      host) to the edge router.  The edge router in its turn establishes
      IP-CAN sub-session for each host to receive the quality of service
      parameters.  The edge router enforces this quality of service which
      is specific to the host on its traffic both uplink and downlink.
      When the host disconnects or leaves the network, IP-CAN sub-session
      is terminated.

      This document describes the Collection Tree Protocol for Lightweight
      Ad hoc On-Demand - Next Generation (LOADng-CT) to build routes from
      all the routers to a root in Mobile Ad Hoc NETworks (MANETs).  The
      protocol is an extension of LOADng.

  "Jitter Consideration for Reactive Protocol in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks
  (MANETs)", Jiazi Yi, Juan Fuertes, Thomas Clausen, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-yi-manet-reactive-jitter-00.txt>

      This document provides recommendations for jittering (randomly
      timing) of routing control message transmission, especially route
      request dissemination, in reactive protocol of Mobile Ad Hoc
      Networks, to reduce the probability of collisions, decrease routing
      overhead, and help finding the optimum routes in the network.

      This document analyzes Link Management Protocol (LMP) according to
      guidelines set forth in section 4.2 of KARP Design Guidelines (RFC
      6518).

  "TCP Instant Recovery: Incorporating Forward Error Correction in TCP",
  Tobias Flach, Nandita Dukkipati, Yuchung Cheng, Barath Raghavan,
  2013-07-14, <draft-flach-tcpm-fec-00.txt>

      Ordinary TCP loss recovery takes at least one round-trip time and as
      such can increase application-perceived latency, especially for short
      flows such as Web transactions.  TCP Instant Recovery (TCP-IR) is an
      experimental algorithm that allows a receiving end to recover lost
      packets without retransmissions, thus potentially saving at least one
      full round-trip time compared to standard TCP.  TCP-IR achieves this
      by judiciously injecting encoded data segments within a TCP stream.
      This document describes the TCP-IR algorithm at the sending and
      receiving ends, along with the required protocol changes.

  "6TSCH Operation Sublayer (6top)", Qin Wang, Xavier Vilajosana, Thomas
  Watteyne, 2013-07-14, <draft-wang-6tsch-6top-00.txt>

      The recently published [IEEE802154e] standard formalizes the concept
      of link-layer resources in LLNs.  Nodes are synchronized and follow a
      schedule.  A time slot in that schedule corresponds to an atomic
      link-layer resource, and can be allocated to any pair of neighbors in
      the network.  This allows the schedule to be built to tightly match
      each node's bandwidth, latency and energy constraints, while ensuring
      collision-free communication.  The [IEEE802154e] standard does not,
      however, present a mechanism to do so, as building and managing the
      schedule is out of the standard's scope.  Routing layers such as the
      IETF IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) provide a mechanism to
      route multipoint-to-point traffic (from devices inside the LLN
      towards a central control point) and point-to-multipoint traffic
      (from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN).
      Network layer overlays cannot be optimized and adapted to take
      advantage of the cell-based topology created by the underlying TSCH
      MAC layer as a missing set of functionalities need to be defined.
      This document describes the 6TSCH Operation Sublayer (6top) and the
      main commands it provides to upper network layers such as RPL or
      GMPLS.  The set of functionalities includes feedback metrics from
      cell states so network layers can take routing decisions, TSCH
      configuration and control procedures, and the support for centralized
      and decentralized scheduling policies.  In addition, 6top can be
      configured to enable packet switching at layer 2.5, analogous to
      GMPLS.  Once a multi-hop track is defined, input cells can be mapped
      to output cells and packets can be relayed without the need of higher
      layer routing. 6top defines the operations so input cells and output
      cells can be mapped and the configuration maintained.

  "Secure Caller-ID Fallback Mode", Eric Rescorla, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-rescorla-stir-fallback-00.txt>

      A major challenge with RFC 4474-style identity assertions has been
      that SIP operates in highly mediated and interworked environments.
      SIP requests may pass through gateways, policy enforcement devices or
      other entities that receive SIP requests and effectively act as user
      agents, re-initiating a request.  In these circumstances,
      intermediaries may recreate the fields protected by the RFC4474
      signature, making end-to end integrity impossible.  This document
      describes a mechanism for two compliant endpoints to exchange
      authentication data even in the face of intermediaries which remove
      all additional call signaling meta-data or which translate from SIP
      into protocols incapable of understanding identity meta-data (e.g.,
      where one side is the PSTN).

  "A Media-based Traceroute Function for the Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP)", Hadriel Kaplan, 2013-07-14, <draft-straw-sip-traceroute-00.txt>

      SIP already provides the ability to perform hop-by-hop traceroute
      for SIP messages using the Max-Forwards header field, in order to
      determine the reachability path of requests to a target.  A
      mechanism for media-loopback calls has also been defined separately,
      which enables test calls to be generated which result in media being
      looped back to the originator.  This document describes a means of
      performing hop-by-hop traceroute-style test calls using the media-
      loopback mechanism, in order to test the media path when SIP
      sessions go through media-relaying B2BUAs.

  "Network Mobility Support in the Distributed Mobility Management", 
  xuan@dcn.ssu.ac.kr, Young-Han Kim, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-xuan-dmm-nemo-dmm-00.txt>

      Network mobility (NEMO) provides session continuity for mobile nodes
      (MN) while moving in vehicles without their involvement in signaling
      process. NEMO Basic support protocol [RFC3963] is standardized to
      provide network mobility support.
      
      Current mobility management protocols, such as MIPv6 [RFC6275] and
      PMIPv6 [RFC5213], rely on a central mobility anchor in order to
      provide mobility support for the mobile nodes. These centralized
      approaches show some big issues, such as a single point of failure,
      non-optimal routing, and scalability. Ever-increasing demand for the
      mobile traffic changes the network architecture from hierarchical to
      flat architecture, and distributed mobility management (DMM)
      approaches are being researched to adapt the new flat architecture
      and overcome big above issues.
      
      This document presents about detailed protocol operation to support
      network mobility in the DMM domain.

  "ASCII Encoding for Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP/A)", Seok-Kap
  Ko, Ilkyun Park, Seung-Hun Oh, Byoung-Tak Lee, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-softgear-core-coapa-00.txt>

      This document defines ASCII encoding method for Constrained
      Application Protocol(CoAP). CoAP has defined a binary encoding method
      to exchange requests and responses between constrained nodes or
      gateways. However, some communication modules in constrained nodes
      support ASCII data only. These modules are cheaper and widely
      deployed. To support these modules, this document describes the
      method to convert binary CoAP messages to base64 styled ASCII
      messages.

  "Label Sharing for Fast PE Protection", Mingui Zhang, Peng Zhou,
  2013-07-15, <draft-zhang-l3vpn-label-sharing-00.txt>

      This document describes a method to be used by Service Providers to
      provide fast protection of VPN connections for a CE. Egress PEs in a
      redundant group always assign the same label for VPN routes from a
      VRF. These egress PEs create a BGP virtual Next Hop (vNH) in the
      domain of the IP/MPLS backbone network as an agent of the CE router.
      Primary and backup tunnels terminated at the vNH are set up by the
      BGP/MPLS IP VPN based on IGP FRR. If the primary egress PE fails, the
      backup egress PEs can recognize the "shared" VPN route label and
      deliver the failure affected packets accordingly.

  "ICCP Application TLVs for VPN Route Label Sharing", Mingui Zhang, Peng
  Zhou, 2013-07-15, <draft-zhang-pwe3-iccp-label-sharing-00.txt>

      This document defines TLVs under Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol
      (ICCP) to include a new application: Label Sharing for Fast PE
      Protection. Egress PEs in the same Redundant Group utilize the ICCP
      connection to negotiate the "VPN route label" and the "BGP next hop"
      for each VPN.

  "Use case Analysis for Supporting Flow Mobility in DMM", 
  gomjae@dcn.ssu.ac.kr, Young-Han Kim, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-sun-dmm-use-case-analysis-flowmob-dmm-00.txt>

      Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) allows network traffic to
      distribute among multiple mobility anchors which have mobility
      functions to solve the existing problems in current centralized
      mobility protocols. There are many DMM approaches extending network-
      based mobility protocols (e.g. Proxy Mobile IPv6).
      
      In Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213], they allow a mobile node to
      connect to PMIPv6 domain through different physical interfaces. In
      this reason, flow mobility that enables movement between physical
      interfaces of mobile node is proposed.
      
      In this document, we present some use cases to support flow mobility
      in DMM domain and analyze some problems. These use cases are based
      on scenarios of flow mobility in PMIPv6. In these scenarios, a
      multi-interface mobile node connects to different distributed
      mobility access points and move specific flows from one interface to
      another. These use cases have common issues which will be analyzed
      in detail.

      This document defines shim header for the transfer of CoAP messages
      over non-TCP/IP constrained networks. In this environment, IP and UDP
      or TCP are not used, so that additional shim header as a container
      for addresses of sender/receiver and the length of CoAP header and
      its payload is required.

  "IP Flow Path Trace Requirements", Yuanbin Yin, Sheng Jiang, Gang Yan,
  2013-07-15, <draft-yin-tsvwg-ipflow-pathtrace-ps-00.txt>

      This document describes the requirements of IP flow path trace.
      Network administrators need to get the real IP flow path information,
      of which a specific IP flow goes through heterogeneous network
      environments. It is also desired for more information relevant to
      the IP flow path. Based on the information, network administrators
      can locate possible faults of the network quickly or optimize
      network resource for better network performance.

  "Use cases and Requirements for Virtual Service Node Pool Management",
  Liang Xia, Wenson Wu, Daniel King, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-xia-vsnpool-management-use-case-00.txt>

      Network edge applications such as subscriber termination, firewalls,
      tunnel switching, intrusion detection, and routing are currently
      provided using dedicated network function hardware.  As network
      function is migrated from dedicated hardware platforms into a
      virtualized environment, a set of use cases with application specific
      requirements begin to emerge.  These use cases and requirements cover
      a broad range of capability and objectives, which will require
      detailed investigation and documentation in order to identify
      relevant architecture, protocol and procedure solutions.
      
      This document provides an analysis of the key management requirements
      for applications that may be hosted within a virtualized environment.
      These engineering requirements are based on a variety of goals
      including: virtual application security, reliability, scalability,
      performance, management and automation.

  "MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) Source Label", Mach Chen, KuiKe
  Building, Zhenbin Li, Luyuan Fang, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-chen-mpls-source-label-00.txt>

      An MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) label is originally defined
      to identify a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC), a packet is
      assigned to a specific FEC based on its network layer destination
      address.  It's difficult or even impossible to derive the source
      information from the label.  For some applications, source
      identification is a critical requirement.  For example, performance
      monitoring, traffic matrix measurement and collection, where the
      monitoring node needs to identify where a packet was sent from.
      
      This document introduces the concept of Source Label (SL) that is
      carried in the label stack and used to identify the ingress Label
      Switching Router (LSR) of an Label Switched Path (LSP).

  "Performance Engineered LSPs using the Segment Routing Data-Plane", Rob
  Shakir, Danny Vernals, Alessandro Capello, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-shakir-rtgwg-sr-performance-engineered-lsps-00.txt>

      A number of applications and services running over IP/MPLS networks
      have strict requirements relating to their routing, or the
      performance of the path supporting their traffic flow, for instance,
      in terms of characteristics such as latency, loss, or bandwidth
      availability.  Segment routing provides a means by which the data-
      plane of an IP/MPLS network can be programmed to support such
      "performance engineered" paths.  This document describes an
      architecture for the use of such performance engineered label
      switched paths, and the control-plane functionality required to allow
      both distributed and centralised computation of acceptable forwarding
      paths.

  "Role-Based State Advertisement for Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs",

      advertise the role and corresponding primary/backup state for
      Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs.  The role-based state advertisement
      can help optimization of process in MPLS/BGP Multicast VPN to reduce
      unnecessary traffic replication and facilitate service provision.

  "NEXTHOP_PATH ATTIBUTE for BGP", Zhenbin Li, Li Zhang, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-zhang-idr-nexthop-path-attr-00.txt>

      As the BGP is deployed in a single Autonomous System for network
      convergence such as Seamless MPLS, it is desirable for BGP to carry
      more information to help select routing more intelligently.  It can
      reduce the cost proposed by complex policy control design on BGP
      routes and adapt to network change easily.  This document proposed a
      new path attribute for BGP routes that can record the next hop path
      for the route to help BGP route selection and network management.

  "RSVP-TE Extensions for Bit Error Rate (BER) Measurement", Zhenbin Li,
  Li Zhang, 2013-07-15, <draft-zhang-ccamp-rsvpte-ber-measure-00.txt>

      In the mobile backhaul network, the mobile service is sensitive to
      Bit Error Rate (BER).  When the BER value of the service exceeds the
      threshold, the Base Station will stop working and the User Equipments
      (UEs) cannot obtain voice and data services anymore.  Now the mobile
      backhaul tends to be IP/MPLS network and MPLS TE LSP is used to bear
      the mobile service which may be encapsulated in PW or L3VPN end to
      end.  Then the ingress Label Switched Router (LSR) of the MPLS TE LSP
      needs to get information on BER along the path of the LSP.  This
      document proposes new extensions of RSVP-TE to advertise the BER
      measurement requirement of the specific LSP to all of the transit
      LSRs and the egress LSR, and to report the BER measurement result
      from any transit or egress LSR towards the ingress LSR.

  "A Distributed Resource Directory (DRD)", Jaime Jimenez, Meirong Liu,
  Erkki Harjula, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-jimenez-distributed-resource-directory-00.txt>

      In some M2M scenarios, it is convenient to offer non-centralized
      alternatives for discovery and rendezvous.  This document defines a
      Distributed Resource Directory (DRD) for Constrained Application
      Protocol (CoAP).  Distribution is achieved by means of a structured
      Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay.  The DHT-based P2P overlay provides
      discovery, rendezvous and caching services for CoAP End-points as
      well as HTTP proxy service for Web clients.

  "Problem statement and Use cases of Sleepy node in Constrained node
  networks", Yung Hong, Joo-Sang Youn, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-hong-lwig-sleepynode-problem-statement-00.txt>

      This document describes the use cases of communication considering
      sleepy nodes and the problems of connecting to sleepy nodes in
      constrained node networks.  The use cases of communications between
      sleepy nodes and non-sleepy nodes are classified by the end-to-end
      communication and the network topology.  The adopt of power saving in
      constrained nodes raises compelling problems in network layer/
      transport/application layer.  In this document, problems of each
      layer in a sleepy node are described.

  "OSPF extension for priority allocation support in the PCE discovery",
  Wenson Wu, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-wu-pce-discovery-priority-allocation-00.txt>

      Each network domain may contain multiple PCE servers.  It provides
      redundancy to the PCCs in the event of a server failure.  However
      load balance decision is made by PCC,it doesn't enable real load
      balance across the PCE servers if PCC still tries PCE one by one and
      PCE doesn't indicate the load status to the PCC.
      
      This document proposes new PCE discovery sub-TLV that can be
      announced as attribute in the OSPF advertisement (defined in [RFC5088
      ]) to distribute priority information.

  <draft-lee-nsc-verification-problem-statement-01.txt>

      This document addresses the possible conflicts between service
      overlays in the network service chaining.  These conflicts are due to
      overlapping in classification rules and resource sharing of service
      overlays.  The verification of service chains provides a method for
      network administrators to detect such conflicts and correct a
      problematic service chain before applying it on the real network.

  Farrer, 2013-07-15, <draft-lepape-6man-prefix-metadata-00.txt>

      This document presents a method for applications to influence the
      IPv6 source selection algorithm used by the IP stack in a host.  To
      do so, IPv6 prefixes are associated with meta-data when configured by
      the network.  This meta-data allows the network to describe the
      purpose and properties of the prefix enabling applications to make
      intelligent decision when selecting a prefix.

      used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in TCP/IP- based
      internets.  In particular, it defines objects for managing Optical
      parameters associated with Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
      (DWDM) interfaces or characterized by the Optical Transport Network
      (OTN).  This is an extension of the RFC3591 to support the optical
      parameters mainly but not only described in recommendations like
      ITU-T G.698.2.  [ITU.G698.2]
      
      The MIB module defined in this memo can be used for Optical
      Parameters monitoring and/or configuration of the endpoints of Black
      Links.

  "Accession to the ITRs Considered Harmful", A. Rutkowski, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-rutkowski-itr-accession-harmful-00.txt>

      One of the treaties maintained by the International Telecommunication
      Union is the International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs), whose
      purpose historically has been to create international service
      uniformity and a global monopoly cartel for provisioning legacy
      international telecommunication services. Nations such as the U.S.
      and Canada have typically neither signed them nor accepted their
      provisions. The 1988 version of the ITRs was similar in purpose and
      effect, but failed in its objectives because the mandated OSI
      services and ITU-T standards were unsuccessful in the marketplace. In
      addition, most of the world's Nation-States moved away from monopoly
      government-run telecom provisioning to competitive market models.
      This also resulted in a substantial decline of the ITU itself as an
      intergovernmental home for monopoly Nation-State providers.
      
      Given this institutional decline and the vestigial opposition of some
      ITU Members to this provisioning paradigm shift, efforts were begun a
      decade ago by some ITU participants and officials to imbue the ITU
      with a vast expansion of its scope and jurisdiction and impose new
      regulatory controls through revisions to the moribund ITRs. Most
      progressive national Administrations opposed these efforts. The
      conflict played out in Dec 2012 in Dubai at a global treaty conference
      known as the WCIT.
      
      Only 89 of the ITU 193 member nations signed the resulting treaty
      instrument at Dubai - largely those without significant national
      communication infrastructure, or those favoring strong regulatory
      regimes for Internet use. The result was an embarrassing
      miscalculation for those seeking these changes. It bifurcated the
      treaty basis for the ITU. This document analyses the many adverse
      effects of the resulting treaty, and identifies problems that may
      arise for those states acceding to the treaty. It concludes by noting
      how the Internet community, including citizens of non-signatory
      countries, benefit from the rejection of this broken treaty
      instrument.

  "ICC Based TLVs for MPLS-TP OAM Functions", Zhenlong Cui, Rolf Winter,
  Lianshu Zheng, Mach Chen, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-cui-mpls-tp-oam-tlv-icc-00.txt>

      This document specifies identifier TLVs for the Multiprotocol Label
      Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  Several IP-compatible TLVs
      have already been defined.  This document extends the existing set of
      identifier TLVs based on MPLS-TP identifiers following ITU-T
      conventions.

  "Packet-oriented QoS management model for a wireless Access Point",
  Sebastien Jobert, Isabelle Hamchaoui, William Diego, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-jobert-iccrg-ip-aware-ap-00.txt>

      This document introduces a packet-oriented QoS management model
      applicable to a wireless Access Point, referred to as "IP aware
      Access Point". This model may be used in addition, or as a
      substitute to the connection-oriented traditional QoS model defined
      for cellular mobile networks, based on the notion of bearer.

  "Traffic Class Routing Protocol in Home Networks", Mingwei Xu, Shu Yang,
  Jianping Wu, Fred Baker, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-xu-homenet-traffic-class-00.txt,.pdf>

      Home IT staff is generally unfamiliar with network operations, making
      it desirable to provide a configuration-free mode of operation.
      Policy-based routing (in the sense of configuring one router to
      redirect traffic to another based on access control) and multi-
      topology routing both require configuration, making them undesirable.
      
      In this document, we propose a configuration-free mechanism, in which
      packets will be routed towards the corresponding upstream ISPs based
      on both destination and source addresses.

  "HTTP/2.0: Header Reference Set Definition", Herve Ruellan, Jun
  Fujisawa, Romain Bellessort, Youenn Fablet, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ruellan-reference-set-definition-00.txt>

      This document describes modifications of the proposed HTTP/2.0 header
      compression mechanism for the definition of the reference set used to
      encode a set of headers.

  "Quantifying Head-of-Line Blocking in TCP and SCTP", Michael Scharf,
  Sebastian Kiesel, 2013-07-15, <draft-scharf-tcpm-reordering-00.txt>

      In order to quantify the impact of head-of-line blocking on
      application latencies, this memo provides simple analytical models
      for a "back of the envelop" estimation of the delay impact for
      reliable transport over a single TCP connection, multiple TCP
      connections, multiple SCTP streams, and unordered transport.

  "SSRC Group Based Simulcast Signaling", Suhas Nandakumar, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-nandakumar-mmusic-rtcweb-grouping-00.txt>

      In some applications it may be necessary to send multiple media
      encodings corresponding to a media source with in independent RTP
      media streams.  This is called Simulcast.  This document discusses a
      framework for describing simulcast media streams in SDP and also
      defines semantics to express relationship amongst them.  The
      semantics defined in this document are to be used with the source
      specific grouping framework defined in the [RFC5576]

  "A YANG Data Model for Network Topologies", Alex Clemm, Hariharan
  Ananthakrishnan, Jan Medved, Tony Tkacik, Robert Varga, Nitin Bahadur,

      This document defines a YANG data model for network topologies.

  "Extended DTLS Session Resumption for Constrained Network Environments",
  Rene Hummen, Johannes Gilger, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-hummen-dtls-extended-session-resumption-00.txt>

      This draft defines two extensions for the existing session resumption
      mechanisms of TLS that specifically apply to Datagram TLS (DTLS) in
      constrained network environments.  Session resumption type
      negotiation enables the client and the server to explicitly agree on
      the session resumption mechanism for subsequent handshakes, thus
      avoiding unnecessary overheads occurring with the existing
      specifications.  Session resumption without client-side state
      additionally enables a constrained DTLS client to resume a session
      without the need to maintain state while the session is inactive.
      The extensions defined in this draft update [RFC5077] and [RFC5246].

  "Extension to the Link Management Protocol (LMP/DWDM -rfc4209) for Dense
  Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) Optical Line Systems to manage
  optical parameters of DWDM applications", Dharini Hiremagalur, Gert
  Grammel, John Drake, Gabriele Galimberti, Zafar Ali, Ruediger Kunze,
  2013-07-15, <draft-dharinigert-ccamp-opt-imp-lmp-00.txt>

      This memo defines extensions to LMP(rfc4209) for managing Optical
      parameters associated with Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)
      systems or characterized by the Optical Transport Network (OTN) in
      accordance with the parameters defined in ITU-T Recommendation
      G.698.2.[ITU.G698.2], G.694.1.[ITU.G694.1] and their extensions./>

  "TWAMP Control of a TCP Connection", Al Morton, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-morton-ippm-twamp-tcp-00.txt>

      This memo describes a feature for the core specification of TWAMP -
      the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol: an optional capability where
      a TCP connection can be coordinated between two participating hosts.
      The feature includes the ability to control TCP configuration
      settings and byte stream characteristics, enabling diagnostic
      testing.

  "I2RS use case for IPv6 transition", Dapeng Liu, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-liu-i2rs-ipv6-use-case-00.txt>

      This document discusses the use cases of I2RS in IPv4/IPv6 transition
      scenario.

  "Mobility Support for Mobile Router", Dapeng Liu, Hui Deng, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-liu-its-mobility-00.txt>

      This document proposes a ITS mobility solution.  The solution is
      based on extensions to current IP mobility protocol.

  "Economical Use of the Offer/Answer Model in Sessions with Multiple
  Media Sources", Emil Ivov, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ivov-mmusic-multiple-sources-00.txt>

      The Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer model describes a
      mechanism that allows two entities to negotiate a multimedia session.
      The SDP syntax of the Offer/Answer model uses constructs known as
      media (m=) lines to describe each medium.  In SDP itself these "m="
      lines were designed to describe RTP sessions with any number of
      streams (SSRCs).  Yet, Offer/Answer implementations in SIP
      applications have most often used them as an envelope for a maximum
      of two RTP streams (SSRCs) at a time: one in each direction.  The
      most common reason for this has been the fact these applications
      could not meaningfully render multiple SSRCs simultaneously.
      
      The above situation has led to difficulties once the need to
      represent multiple (SSRCs) in an interoperable manner became more
      common.
      
      This document explores the use of "m=" lines for the negotiation of
      sessions with multiple media sources, as per their original design in
      SDP.  It presents the advantages of such an approach as well as the
      challenges that it implies in terms of interoperability with already
      deployed legacy devices.
      
      The model described here was first presented in the RTCWEB No Plan
      proposal.  The reason to spin it off into this new document is mainly
      to separate the parts related to Offer/Answer and "m=" line
      semantics, from those that are specific to WebRTC.

  "IP Prefix Advertisement in E-VPN", Jorge Rabadan, Jorge Rabadan, Wim
  Henderickx, Senad Palislamovic, Senad Palislamovic, Florin Balus, Florin
  Balus, Aldrin Isaac, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-rabadan-l2vpn-evpn-prefix-advertisement-00.txt>

      E-VPN provides a flexible control plane that allows intra-subnet
      connectivity in an IP/MPLS and/or an NVO-based network. In Data
      Centers, there is also a need for a dynamic and efficient inter-
      subnet connectivity across Tenant Systems and End Devices that can be
      physical or virtual and may not support their own routing protocols.
      This document defines a new E-VPN route type for the advertisement of
      IP Prefixes and explains how E-VPN should be used to provide
      inter-subnet connectivity with the flexibility required by the Data
      Center applications.

  "Data Center Interconnect Solution for E-VPN Overlay networks", Jorge
  Rabadan, Wim Henderickx, Senthil Sathappan, Senad Palislamovic, Florin
  Balus, 2013-07-15, <draft-rabadan-l2vpn-dci-evpn-overlay-00.txt>

      This document describes how Network Virtualization Overlay networks
      (NVO3) can be connected to a Wide Area Network (WAN) in order to
      extend the layer-2 connectivity required for some tenants. The
      solution will analyze the interaction between NVO3 networks running
      E-VPN and other technologies used in the WAN, such as VPLS/PBB-VPLS
      or E-VPN/PBB-EVPN.

  "Recommendations for FTP Clients and Servers in the IPv6/IPv4 Transition
  Scenario", Dapeng Liu, Iljitsch van Beijnum, Hui Deng, Zhen Cao,
  2013-07-15, <draft-liu-ftpext2-ftp64-00.txt>

      The File transfer protocol, which was originally defined in RFC 114
      and published in 1971, well before TCP and IP were created.  However,
      it is still in wide use.  Many FTP servers implement RFC 959, which
      requires IPv4.  RFC 2428 defines extensions that allow FTP to work
      over IPv6 by introducing the EPRT and EPSV commands.  When IPv6 FTP
      clients attempt to communicate with IPv4 FTP servers through an
      IPv6-IPv4 translator, only certain combinations of FTP client and
      server behavior lead to successful file transfers.  This document
      proposes the best current practice for IPv6 FTP client
      implementations in the IPv6-IPv4 translation scenario, allowing file
      transfers to succeed without the presence of an ALG (Application
      Layer Gateway).

  "A Unified Plan for Using SDP with Large Numbers of Media Flows", Adam
  Roach, Justin Uberti, Martin Thomson, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-roach-mmusic-unified-plan-00.txt>

      A recurrent theme in emerging real-time communications use cases,
      such as RTCWEB, has been the need to handle very large numbers of
      media flows.  Unfortunately, naive uses of SDP do not handle this
      case particularly well.  This document describes a modest set of
      extensions to SDP which allow it to cleanly handle arbitrary numbers
      of flows while still retaining a large degree of backward
      compatibility with existing and non-RTCWEB endpoints.

  "TRILL: Interface Addresses APPsub-TLV", Donald Eastlake, Li Yizhou,
  Radia Perlman, 2013-07-15, <draft-eastlake-trill-ia-appsubtlv-00.txt>

      This document specifies a TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots
      of Links) IS-IS application sub-TLV that enables the reporting by a
      TRILL switch sets of addresses such that all of the addresses in each
      set designate the same interface (port). For example, an EUI-48 MAC
      (Extended Unique Identifier 48-bit, Media Access Control) address,
      IPv4 address, and IPv6 address can be reported as all corresponding
      to the same interface. Such information could be used, for example,
      to synthesize responses to or by-pass the need for the Address
      Resolution Protocol (ARP), the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol,
      of the flooding of unknown MAC addresses, in some cases.

  "Conformance tests for Multipath TCP", Yvan Coene, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-coene-mptcp-conformance-00.txt>

      This document describes a series of tests which aim at evaluating the
      compliance of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) implementations to [RFC6824].
      The current version of this document focuses on the conformance of
      the three-way handshake.  Subsequent versions of the document will
      contain tests for the other parts of the protocol.

  "LISP Extensions for Segment Routing", Frank Brockners, Cisco Systems,
  Fabio Maino, Darrel Lewis, 2013-07-15, <draft-brockners-lisp-sr-00.txt>

      Segment Routing (SR) combines source routing and tunneling to steer
      traffic through the transit network.  The Locator/ID Separation
      Protocol (LISP) separates IP addresses into Endpoint Identifiers
      (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs) and also leverages tunneling
      mechanisms.  Mapping between EIDs and RLOCs is facilitated by the
      LISP mapping system.  Combining LISP and SR enables the LISP mapping
      system to provide SR information to encapsulating routers so that
      traffic can be steered in the transit network or the list of segments
      a particular packet traverses is recorded in the packet header.
      
      This document describes extensions required to the Locator/ID
      Separation Protocol (LISP) to enable a LISP mapping system to
      communicate list of segment identifiers or the request to record the
      list of segments a particular packet traverses to the encapsulating
      router.

  "Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) for Service Chaining: Use Cases
  and Requirements", Nabil Bitar, Giles Heron, Luyuan Fang, ramki, Nicolai
  Leymann, Himanshu Shah, Wassim Haddad, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-bitar-i2rs-service-chaining-00.txt>

      Service chaining is the concept of applying an ordered set of
      services to a packet or a flow. Services in the chain may
      include network services such as load-balancing, firewalling,
      intrusion prevention, and routing among others. Criteria for
      applying a service chain to a packet or flow can be based on
      packet/flow attributes that span the OSI layers (e.g., physical
      port, Ethernet MAC header information, IP header information,
      Transport and application layer information). This document
      describes use cases and I2RS (Information to the Rousting
      System) requirements for the discovery and maintenance of
      services topology and resources. It also describes use cases
      and I2RS requirements for controlling the forwarding of a
      packet/flow along a service chain based on packet/flow
      attributes.

  "Aggregating large-scale measurements for Application Layer Traffic
  Optimization (ALTO) Protocol", David Goergen, R State, Vijay Gurbani,
  2013-07-15, <draft-goergen-lmap-fcc-00.txt>

      Analyzing and aggregating large-scale broadband measurements is
      essential to study trends and derive network analytics.  These trends
      and analyses could be made available through well defined protocols
      such as the Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol.
      However, ALTO requires network information to be distilled and
      abstracted in form of a network map and a cost map.  We describe our
      methodology for analyzing the United States Federal Communication
      Commission's (FCC) Measuring Broadband America (MBA) dataset to
      derive required topology and cost maps suitable for consumption by an
      ALTO server.

  "SDN Layers and Architecture Terminology", Evangelos Haleplidis, Spyros
  Denazis, Odysseas Koufopavlou, Kostas Pentikousis, Jamal Hadi Salim,
  2013-07-15, <draft-haleplidis-sdnrg-layer-terminology-00.txt>

      Software-Defined Networking introduces an abstraction layer and by
      doing so separates the Forwarding from the Control layer.  This
      separation can allow faster innovation cycles at both layers as
      experience has already shown.  However, there is increasing confusion
      as to what exactly SDN is, what is the layer stucture in an SDN
      architecture and how do layers interface with each other.  This
      document aims to provide a concise reference for future discussions
      in SDNRG.

  "ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable due Sleep", Teemu Savolainen,
  2013-07-15, <draft-savolainen-6man-icmp-destination-sleeping-00.txt>

      A destination node may be unreachable due being in sleep mode that
      lasts longer than is feasible to buffer a packet in a network or at
      the last hop entity, such as a router of a link.  In such scenarios
      the originator of the packet can be better off knowing destination's
      sleep being the cause of destination unreachable ICMPv6 message
      emitted by the entity dropping the packet.  This document defines an
      ICMPv6 Code value for indicating Destination Unreachable due sleep.

  "Liveliness and Cancellation of Separate Responses and Observations",
  Klaus Hartke, 2013-07-15, <draft-hartke-core-coap-liveliness-00.txt>

      This document extends the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
      with a simple mechanism for a client to determine the "liveliness" of
      a request for which it is still expecting a response or a
      notification, and with a mechanism to request the cancellation of
      such a request.

  "Authentication, Authorization and Policy Management for Routing
  Protocols",  william.atwood@concordia.ca, Revathi Somanatha, Sam
  Hartman, Dacheng Zhang, 2013-07-15, <draft-atwood-karp-aapm-rp-00.txt>

      When tightening the security of the core routing infrastructure, one
      requirement is to ensure that the keying material for the routing
      protocol exchanges is distributed only to the appropriate routers.
      This document specifies requirements on the authentication and
      authorization of routers and proposes the use of policy distribution
      to achieve those requirements.

  "Broadcast With Network Coding: DRAGONCAST", Cedric Adjih, Songyean Cho,
  Emmanuel Baccelli, 2013-07-15, <draft-adjih-dragoncast-00.txt>

      This document describes a Network Coding (NC) based broadcast
      protocol suitable mainly for wireless networks, including mobile ad
      hoc networks (MANET).  It provides data dissemination from a single
      source, based on intra-flow network coding and for Internet Protocol
      (IP).  It is designed to minimize the assumptions over the working
      environment and thus may operates over dynamically evolving
      environments.

  "ALTO Topology Considerations", Yang Yang, 2013-07-15,

  "Using DANE to Associate OTR public keys with email addresses", Paul
  Wouters, 2013-07-15, <draft-wouters-dane-otrfp-00.txt>

      The Off-the-Record (OTR) protocol exchanges public keys in-band.
      This document describes how to use DANE to securely associate an
      Instant Message user identified by their email address with an OTR
      public key.  This association helps to authenticate users and protect
      against MITM attacks.

  "Using DANE to Associate OpenPGP public keys with email addresses", Paul
  Wouters, 2013-07-15, <draft-wouters-dane-openpgp-00.txt>

      OpenPGP is a message format for email (and file) encryption, that
      lacks a standarized secure lookup mechanism to obtain OpenPGP public
      keys.  This document specifies a standarized method for securely
      publishing and locating OpenPGP public keys in DNS using a new
      OPENPGPKEY DNS Resource Record.

  "Multicast state damping", Thomas Morin, Stephane Litkowski, Keyur
  Patel, Jeffrey Zhang, Robert Kebler, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-morin-multicast-damping-00.txt>

      This document describes procedures to damp multicast routing state
      changes and prevent the churn due to the multicast dynamicity at the
      edge of a network.  The procedures described in this document help
      avoid uncontrolled control plane load increase on the core routing
      infrastructure.  New procedures are proposed inspired from BGP
      unicast route damping principles, but adapted to multicast.  They
      cover multicast and multicast in VPNs contexts.

  "Private Autonomous System (AS) Removal Requirements", Jon Mitchell,

      that remove Private Use Autonomous System (AS) numbers from the AS
      path of routes sent to external Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peers.

  "A REST API For Access To TURN Services", Justin Uberti, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-uberti-behave-turn-rest-00.txt>

      This document describes a proposed standard REST API for obtaining
      access to TURN services via ephemeral (i.e. time-limited)
      credentials.  These credentials are vended by a web service over
      HTTP, and then supplied to and checked by a TURN server using the
      standard TURN protocol.  The usage of ephemeral credentials ensures
      that access to the TURN server can be controlled even if the
      credentials can be discovered by the user, as is the case in WebRTC
      where TURN credentials must be specified in Javascript.

  "Stateful PCE Extensions for Data Plane Switchover and Balancing",
  Yosuke Tanaka, Yuji Kamite, Ina Minei, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-tanaka-pce-stateful-pce-data-ctrl-00.txt>

      Stateful PCE (Path Computation Element) and its corresponding
      protocol extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do
      stateful control of MPLS Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
      LSP).  One application that stateful PCE can realize is data traffic
      reoptimization.  Data traffic traversed in a LSP can be switched to
      another PCE-initiated LSP.  Moreover, data traffic can also be
      balanced to multiple PCE-initiated LSPs using stateful PCE.
      
      This document specifies the extensions to Path Computation Element
      Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to do switchover and
      balancing of data traffic with PCE-initiated LSPs.  This document
      also specifies the usage and handling of stateful PCEP (PCE
      Communication Protocol) messages and the expected behavior of PCC as
      the RSVP-TE headend.

  "Separation of Control and User Plane for Proxy Mobile IPv6", Ryuji
  Wakikawa, Rajesh Pazhyannur, Sri Gundavelli, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-wakikawa-netext-pmip-cp-up-separation-00.txt>

      This document describes splitting of Control Plane (CP) and User
      Plane (UP) for a Proxy Mobile IPv6 based network infrastructure.
      Existing specifications allow a MAG to perform splitting of its
      control and user plane using Alternate Care of address mobility
      option for IPv6, or Alternate IPv4 Care of Address option for IPv4.
      However, the current specification does not have semantics for
      allowing the LMA to perform such functional split.  To realize this
      requirement, this specification defines a mobility option that
      enables a local mobility anchor to provide an alternate LMA address
      to be used for the bi-directional tunnel between the MAG and LMA.
      With this extension, a local mobility anchor will be able to use an
      IP address for its user plane which is different than what is used
      for the control plane.

  "Differentiated Services Delay-and-Loss vs. Loss-Rate-Adaptive Service
  Classes", James Polk, Toerless Eckert, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-polk-tsvwg-delay-vs-loss-ds-service-classes-00.txt>

      This document discusses how RTCWeb/RMCAT applications could best
      leverage existing and new DiffServ assignments and why we think it
      is necessary to differentiate the assignments of delay-and-loss-
      based vs. just-loss-based rate-adaptive video applications.

  "The PPP ARCFOUR Encryption Protocol", William Simpson, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-simpson-ppp-arc4-00.txt>

      The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC1661] provides a standard
      method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point
      links.
      
      The PPP Encryption Control Protocol (ECP) [RFC1968] provides a method
      to negotiate and utilize encryption protocols over PPP encapsulated
      links.
      
      This document described the use of the ARCFOUR algorithm for
      encrypting PPP encapsulated packets.

  "OSPF Stub Neighbors", Khalid Raza, Jon Cavanaugh, Andrew Kulawiak,
  Padma Pillay-Esnault, Faraz Shamim, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-raza-ospf-stub-neighbor-00.txt>

      Open Shortest Path First stub neighbor is an enhancement to the
      protocol to support large scale of neighbors in some topologies with
      improved convergence behavior.  It introduces limited changes
      protocol behavior to implement a scalable solution for hub and spoke
      topologies by restricting the functionality changes to the hub.  The
      concepts are also applicable to a host running in a virtual machine
      environment.

  "Diameter Overload Architecture and Information Model", Hannes
  Tschofenig, 2013-07-15, <draft-tschofenig-dime-overload-arch-00.txt>

      This document describes the architecture for Diameter overload
      control architecture in form of principles and presents an
      information model.

  "The Diameter Load Balancing Application (DLBA)", Hannes Tschofenig,
  2013-07-15, <draft-tschofenig-dime-dlba-00.txt>

      This specification documents a Diameter Load Balancing Application
      (DLBA), which uses the normal Diameter application approach for the
      capability negotiation, propagation and management of Diameter load
      information between Diameter nodes to enable load balancing of
      Diameter requests.

  "Diameter Overload Piggybacking", Hannes Tschofenig, 2013-07-15,

      information between Diameter servers and Diameter clients.

  "Privacy Considerations for IPv6 Address Generation Mechanisms", Alissa
  Cooper, Fernando Gont, Dave Thaler, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-cooper-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy-00.txt>

      This document discusses privacy and security considerations for
      several IPv6 address generation mechanisms, both standardized and
      non-standardized.  It evaluates how different mechanisms mitigate
      different threats and the trade-offs that implementors, developers,
      and users face in choosing different addresses or address generation
      mechanisms.

  "An Information Model for Network Topologies", Jan Medved, Nitin
  Bahadur, Alex Clemm, Hariharan Ananthakrishnan, 2013-07-15,

      This document defines the information model for network topologies.

  "Delegated CoAP Authorization Function (DCAF)", Stefanie Gerdes, Olaf
  Bergmann, Carsten Bormann, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-gerdes-core-dcaf-authorize-00.txt>

      This specification defines a protocol for delegating client
      authentication and authorization in a constrained environment for
      establishing a Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) channel
      between resource-constrained nodes.  The protocol relies on DTLS to
      transfer authorization information and shared secrets for symmetric
      cryptography between entities in a constrained network.  A resource-
      constrained node can use this protocol to delegate authentication of
      communication peers and management of authorization information to a
      trusted host with less limitations regarding processing power and
      memory.

  "Parallel NFS (pNFS) Flexible Files Layout", Benny Halevy, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-bhalevy-nfsv4-flex-files-00.txt>

      Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) to
      allow clients to directly access file data on the storage used by the
      NFSv4 server.  This ability to bypass the server for data access can
      increase both performance and parallelism, but requires additional
      client functionality for data access, some of which is dependent on
      the class of storage used, a.k.a. the Layout Type.  The main pNFS
      operations and data types in NFSv4 Minor version 1 specify a layout-
      type-independent layer; layout-type-specific information is conveyed
      using opaque data structures whose internal structure is further
      defined by the particular layout type specification.  This document
      specifies the NFSv4.1 Flexible Files pNFS Layout as a companion to
      the main NFSv4 Minor version 1 specification for use of pNFS with
      Data Servers over NFSv4 or higher minor versions using flexible, per-
      file striping topology.

      This document describes a simple L2 Ethernet over IPv6 tunnel
      encapsulation with mandatory 64-bit authentication key for connecting
      L2 Ethernet attachment circuits identified by IPv6 addresses.  The
      encapsulation is based on L2TPv3 over IP.

  "A Framework and Inventory for a Large Scale Measurement System", Aamer
  Akhter, Paul Aitken, 2013-07-15, <draft-akhter-lmap-framework-00.txt>

      This LMAP framework document reviews the LMAP Working Group charter,
      considers the necessary building blocks, and looks at what we already
      have in the IETF and what's missing, so that LMAP Working Group
      attention can be focused on where the gaps are.

  "Use Case from a measurement provider perspective for LMAP", Kenichi
  Nagami, Satoshi Kamei, Kenji Koita, Toshiya Jitsuzumi, Ichiro Mizukoshi,
  2013-07-15, <draft-nagami-lmap-use-case-measurement-provider-00.txt>

      This document describes an example of the use cases of measurement

  "Fine-Grained Control of Control-Plane Performance: Use Cases and
  Mechanisms", Li Li, Yan Luo, Haibin Song, Yang Yang, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-li-cp-usecases-00.txt>

      It is commonly assumed that a system controller or network management
      system has complete knowledge of the data plane, especially in a
      software-defined network (SDN).  That is, the controller knows
      performance metrics such as the flow table size of each switch, the
      rate of rule updates between a switch control plane and its data
      plane, and the maximum latency to install a rule in the flow table of
      a switch.  However, in reality, this is not the case.  Measurement
      studies show that the flow table size depends on the structure of the
      rules installed.  The flow table size is much smaller if there are
      many wild card rules.  The setup latency also depends on the already
      installed rules.  If there are many wild card rules installed, the
      latency can be much higher.  Currently, data centers pre-setup the
      rules long before the actual associated traffic starts to flow
      through the network.  This puts constraints on the use cases.  In
      this document, we first show that many use cases demand a more
      predictable control plane.  The use cases are applied to networks
      that require control-plane performance information for dynamic
      configuration, as well as SDN networks.  We then discuss potential
      mechanisms to enable fine-grained control of control-plane
      performance.

  "L3VPN Virtual Network Overlay Multicast", Dhananjaya Rao, Vipin Jain,
  2013-07-15, <draft-drao-l3vpn-virtual-network-overlay-multicast-00.txt>

      Virtual network overlays are extremely useful for supporting
      multicast applications in multi-tenant data center networks, by
      distributing the per-tenant multicast state and forwarding actions at
      the network edges with minimal control plane load and simpler
      forwarding in the core.  A virtual overlay network may use existing
      encapsulations such as MPLS-in-GRE or newer IP based encapsulations
      such as VXLAN and NVGRE.
      
      IP multicast sources and receivers are very commonly spread out
      across multiple subnets.  Sources and receivers may also be spread
      within and outside a single network domain such as a data center.
      Hence, a Layer-3 multicast paradigm is the most suitable and
      efficient approach for delivery of IP multicast traffic.
      
      BGP based MVPNs provide a good basis for providing a solution to
      support IP multicast across these overlay networks.  An appropriate
      subset of the MVPN control plane and procedures are sufficient to
      support the requirements, providing for a simpler model of operation.
      This document describes the use of BGP based MVPNs alongwith the new
      IP-based virtual network overlay encapsulations to provide a Layer-3
      virtualization solution for IP multicast traffic, and specifies
      mechanisms to use the new encapsulations while continuing to leverage
      the BGP MVPN control plane techniques and extensions.

  "A proposal for Caller Identity in a DNS-based Entrusted Registry
  (CIDER)", Hadriel Kaplan, 2013-07-15, <draft-kaplan-stir-cider-00.txt>

      This document describes a proposal for providing a database service
      for authentication information for Caller-ID E.164 numbers,
      nationally-specific number codes, and email-style names used in
      communication requests (such as call setup, instant messages). The
      model proposed uses a DNS service as a Registry for cryptographic
      public-keys.  The database service solution is called CIDER.

  "ALTO Cost Value Name", Sabine Randriamasy, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-randriamasy-alto-cost-value-name-00.txt>

      The IETF ALTO protocol provides guidance to content delivery
      applications such as P2P or Content Delivery Networks (CDN), which
      have to select one or several hosts or endpoints from a set of
      candidates that are able to provide a desired data resource.  This
      guidance shall be based on parameters that affect performance and
      efficiency of the data transmission between the hosts, for instance
      the topological distance or the routing cost between them.  To this
      end, ALTO Servers deployed by Network Operators (NO), provide
      requesting ALTO Clients with information, currently such as the NO-
      centric view on the network topology, the candidate application
      endpoints with attributes such as their connectivity type.
      
      The present draft proposes to extend the cost information provided by
      the ALTO protocol by providing, for a same cost metric, several
      possible cost values.  Which value to provide depends on qualitative
      criteria as opposed to quantitative criteria such as time.  The
      purpose is to allow a finer grained decision on which application
      endpoint or sub network to access given that their routing cost
      values may depend on criteria suh as the access technology of the end
      system consuming the resources or the policy applied for the client
      requesting ALTO information.

  "Updates to RFC 4379 IANA section", Loa Andersson, 2013-07-16,
  <draft-andersson-mpls-lsp-ping-upd-00.txt>

      The MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) protcol for detecting Label
      Switched Path failures (LSP Ping), as defined in RFC 4379 and several
      extensions, are widely deployed and very popular.
      
      The IANA sectiion of RFC4379 lack in clarity and need to be updated.

  "A-PAWS: Alternative Approach for PAWS", Yoshifumi Nishida, 2013-07-28,
  <draft-nishida-tcpm-apaws-00.txt>

      This documents describe a technique called A-PAWS which can provide
      protection against old duplicates segments like PAWS.  While PAWS
      requires TCP to set timestamp options in all segments in a TCP
      connection, A-PAWS supports the same feature without using
      timestamps.  A-PAWS is designed to be used complementary with PAWS.
      TCP needs to use PAWS when it is necessary and activates A-PAWS only
      when it is safe to use.  Without impairing the reliability and the
      robustness of TCP, A-PAWS can provide more option space to other TCP
      extensions.

  "Writing I-Ds using HTML", Phillip Hallam-Baker, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-hallambaker-rfctool-01.txt>

      This memo presents a technique for using as subset HTML as a source
      format for documents in the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and Request for
      Comments (RFC) series. The HTML subset provides equivalent
      functionality to the traditional XML2RFC tool but is designed for
      ease of use with readily available editing tools.
      
      Extensions to the HTML markup allow the use of external bibliography
      files to manage citations and references in the manner of BibTeX.
      Planned extensions include building concordances of defined terms and
      normative language.

  "The Accept-Post HTTP Header", John Arwe, Steve Speicher, Erik Wilde,
  2013-07-29, <draft-wilde-accept-post-00.txt>

      This specification defines a new HTTP response header field Accept-
      Post, which indicates server support for specific media types for
      entity bodies in HTTP POST requests.
      
      Note to Readers
      
      This draft should be discussed on the apps-discuss mailing list [9].

  "Top-Level Domains that Are Already Dotless", John Levine, Paul Hoffman,
  2013-07-29, <draft-hoffine-already-dotless-00.txt>

      Recent statements from the Internet Architecture Board and ICANN's
      Security and Stability Advisory Committee have discussed the problems
      that the DNS is likely to experience with top-level domains that have
      address records in them (so-called "dotless domains").  However,
      these statements spoke of the problem mostly as theoretical, when in
      fact there are such TLDs today.  This document lists the current
      dotless TLDs, and gives a script for finding them.  This document
      lists data about dotless TLDs, but does not address the policy and
      technology issues other than to point to the statements of others.

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Success Response Code for Indication
  of Alternate Target Answerer", Hadriel Kaplan, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-kaplan-dispatch-sip-205-response-00.txt>

      This document defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
      response, 205 Alternate Answerer, that a SIP User Agent Server (UAS)
      can use to indicate to the User Agent Client (UAC) that the UAS is
      answering the request for which it was not the intended target.
      This is useful for cases where the UAC might wish to perform
      different actions based on such knowledge, such as terminate the
      dialog or re-attempt the request in a different way.

  "OAuth 2.0 User Authentication For Client", Phil Hunt, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-hunt-oauth-v2-user-a4c-00.txt,.pdf>

      This specification defines a new OAuth2 endpoint that enables user
      authentication session information to be shared with client
      applications.

  "Routers auto-configuration using Route Information Option from ICMPv6
  Router Advertisements", Pierre Pfister, Alexandru Petrescu, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-pfister-moving-net-autoconf-00.txt>

      This draft defines a way for multiple routers that are communicating
      on a single link to exchange routing information using Router
      Advertisements.  This allows moving networks to communicate with each
      other through auto-configured routers.  This document specifies a new
      flag for the Router Information option from ICMPv6 Router
      Advertisement messages and specifies how routers must process such
      options.

  "A Framework of Multipath Transport System Based on Application-Level
  Relay (MPTS-AR)", Lei Weimin, Wei Zhang, Shaowei Liu, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-leiwm-tsvwg-mpts-ar-00.txt>

      Multipath transport is an important way to improve the efficiency of
      data delivery. This document defines a multipath transport system
      framework in which application-level relays are deployed to provide
      the conditions to enable multiple paths between source and
      destination. In the proposed framework, endpoints are allowed to use
      multiple paths, including the default IP path and relay paths, to
      transport data in a single session. A relay path may via one or more
      relays which provide application-level relay services for endpoints.
      This framework defines three kinds of logical entities including user
      agent, relay server and relay controller. Relay server provides relay
      service for user agents based on a local path-table. Relay controller
      manages relay servers and relay paths. User agent maintains multiple
      end-to-end paths which include a default path and multiple relay
      paths. The framework also defines a relay service control protocol
      named OpenPath protocol in control plane to manage relay paths, and a
      profile of multipath transport protocol suite in data plane to
      facilitate multipath data transport. The multipath transport system
      framework can support various applications including applications
      requiring timely delivery of real-time data such as streaming media,
      and applications requiring ordered reliable delivery of stream of
      data such as file transfer.

  "Multipath Message Transport Protocol Based on Application-level Relay
  (MPMTP-AR)", Lei Weimin, Shaowei Liu, Wei Zhang, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-leiwm-tsvwg-mpmtp-ar-00.txt>

      Multipath transmission is an important way to improve the quality of
      service for message transport. This document defines a multipath
      message transmission protocol under the framework of Multipath
      Transport System Based on Application-level Relay (MPTS-AR). This
      protocol follows OpenPath and MPTP Profile defined in MPTS-AR. Apart
      from behaviors of user agent defined in MPTS-AR, user agent should be
      also responsible for message reliable transmission,including
      connective session establishment, sequenced deliver,select
      acknowledgement, retransmission, recombination and congestion
      avoidance, etc. This document describes those new or changed
      behaviors, and expands the MPTP format to meet them.Moreover this
      document illustrates the details of multipath transmission mechanism
      reference to the reliable transmission characteristics.

  "Multipath Real-Time Transport Protocol Based on Application-Level Relay
  (MPRTP-AR)", Lei Weimin, Wei Zhang, Shaowei Liu, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-leiwm-avtcore-mprtp-ar-00.txt>

      Currently, most multimedia applications utilize a combination of
      real-time transport protocol (RTP) and user datagram protocol (UDP).
      Application programs at the source end format payload data into RTP
      packets using RTP specifications and dispatch them using unreliable
      UDP along a single path. Multipath transport is an important way to
      improve the efficiency of data delivery. In order to apply the
      framework of multipath transport system based on application-level
      relay (MPTS-AR) to RTP-based multipath applications, this document
      defines a multipath real-time transport protocol based on
      application-level relay (MPRTP-AR), which is a concrete
      application-specific multipath transport protocol (MPTP). Packet
      formats and packet types of MPRTP-AR follow the common rules
      specified in MPTP profile. Based on MPRTP-AR, RTP-based multimedia
      applications can make full use of the advantages brought by the
      multipath transport system based on application-level relay.

  "PCP Usage for Quality of Service (QoS) in Mobile Networks", Reinaldo
  Penno, Tirumaleswar Reddy, Dan Wing, Bill Ver Steeg, Mohamed Boucadair,
  2013-07-29, <draft-penno-pcp-mobile-qos-00.txt>

      There are challenges to request quality of service for an application
      or network flow that is not part of a mobile network's Evolved Packet
      Core (EPC).  This document addresses this issue by defining a
      mechanism to signal the desired characteristics of a flow to the
      Mobile Network from a User Equipment (UE) using Port Control Protocol
      (PCP).  The signaled characteristics allow the Mobile Network to
      enforce appropriate policies such as prioritize that flow accordingly
      and trigger dedicated bearer activation or bearer modification
      procedure.

  "Flexible Dynamic Mesh VPN", Frederic Detienne, Manish Kumar, Mike
  Sullenberger, 2013-07-29, <draft-detienne-dmvpn-00.txt>

      The purpose of a Dynamic Mesh VPN (DMVPN) is to allow IPsec/IKE
      Security Gateways administrators to configure the devices in a
      partial mesh (often a simple star topology called Hub-Spokes) and let
      the Security Gateways establish direct protected tunnels called
      Shortcut Tunnels.  These Shortcut Tunnels are dynamically created
      when traffic flows and are protected by IPsec.

  "Large-Scale Broadband Measurement Enterprise Use-Case", Christopher
  Inacio, 2013-07-29, <draft-inacio-lmap-enterprise-use-case-00.txt>

      The Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) working
      group is defining mechanisms to monitor network performance of large-
      scale networks.  The use case will describe how very large enterprise
      networks are not very different from the networks considered by other
      LMAP use cases and that most measurements are useful to both use
      cases.  In addition this use case will state the need for the ability
      to have finer grained observation related to User Experience
      potentially on a per application basis.

  "Binary Uniform Language Kit 1.0", Pierre Thierry, 2013-07-30,

  "Distributed Mobility Management Approaches with IPv6 Prefix
  Properties", Wen Luo, Yangwei Tu, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-luo-dmm-ipv6-prefix-properties-00.txt>

      This document proposes a potential distributed mobility management
      solution by taking advantage of the feature with IPv6 Prefix Mobility
      Management.  Solutions for extending properties to IPv6 prefixes are
      introduced by defining an extension to the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
      protocol and its Prefix Information Option (PIO).  In the case of
      Distributed Mobility Management, this idea can also be leveraged to
      describe the mobility management properties associated to the IPv6
      prefix.

  "CMC (Certificate Management over Cryptographic Message Syntax)
  Extensions: Server Key Generation", Jim Schaad, Sean Turner, Paul
  Timmel, 2013-07-30, <draft-turner-cmc-serverkeygeneration-00.txt>

      This document defines a set of extensions to the Certificate
      Management over Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMC) protocol that
      addresses the desire to support server-side generation of keys.  This
      service is provided by the definition of additional control
      statements within the CMC architecture.  Additional CMC errors are
      also defined.

  "IPv6 CE Device DHCPv6 Option Transparency", Mark Smith, 2013-07-30,
  <draft-smith-v6ops-ce-dhcpv6-transparency-00.txt>

      [RFC6204] defines basic requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers,
      to suit residential or small office IPv6 deployments.  It describes a
      WAN interface DHCPv6 client and LAN interface DHCPv6 server
      implementation model.  This model constrains the set of DHCPv6
      options that can be conveyed between the upstream service provider
      and the hosts downstream of the CE device, to those supported by both
      the CE device's DHCPv6 client and server.  To support further current
      and future DHCPv6 options, this memo instead proposes a DHCPv6 option
      "transparent" implementation model for CE devices, primarily using
      DHCPv6 message relaying.

  "A TCP transport for CoAP", Carsten Bormann, 2013-07-30,
  <draft-bormann-core-coap-tcp-00.txt>

      CoAP is defined to be transported over datagram transports such as
      UDP or DTLS.  For a number of applications, it may be useful to
      channel CoAP messages in a TCP connection.  This draft discusses
      different ways to do that.

  "dnsxml - A standard XML representation of DNS data", Jay Daley, Stephen
  Morris, John Dickinson, 2013-07-30, <draft-daley-dnsxml-00.txt>

      This memo describes a syntax for encoding DNS Resource Records in
      XML, and a schema to define that syntax written in XML Schema.  It
      can be used to represent all DNS RDATA.  This can be used by diverse
      applications as a common format.
      
      DNS Resource Records are represented as XML elements with the name of
      the element taken from the mnemonic used to represent the DNS
      Resource Record in presentation format.  The RDATA is represented as
      XML attributes or content of the element.  The attribute names are
      taken from the RDATA field names specified in the normative RFC.

  "Distributed Mobility Management Approach with Mobile IP", Yangwei Tu,
  Wen Luo, Tricci So, 2013-07-31, <draft-tu-dmm-with-mip-00.txt>

      Based on the analysis of current centralized mobility management
      approaches, three main functions of current centralized mobility
      anchor are introduced, which are Mobility Routing (MR), Home Address
      Allocation (HAA), and Location Management (LM).
      
      Based on the proposal of decoupling those functions, this document
      provides a concept of architecture for Distributed Mobility
      Management (DMM) with some key approaches for DMM.

  "Uniform Resource Names (URN) Formal Namespace IANA Registration", Marc
  Blanchet, 2013-07-31, <draft-blanchet-urn-ianachange-00.txt>

      Per RFC3406, Uniform Resource Names formal namespace identifier (NID)
      registration requires the publication of an RFC from the requestor.
      Experience shows that this requirement is too high.  This document
      updates the IANA registration policy for formal NID to Expert review.

  "IGP Extensions for Segment Routing Capable PCE Discovery", Siva
  Sivabalan, Jan Medved, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-sivabalan-pce-disco-segment-routing-00.txt>

      When a PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR) participating in
      Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or a server participating in IGP,
      its presence and path computation capabilities can be advertised
      using IGP flooding.  Such IGP extensions exist for OSPF and ISIS to
      advertise several such capabilities.  Segment Routing (SR) leverages
      the source routing and tunneling pardigms in which a node steers a
      packet through the network using segments.  A segment can be an MPLS
      label or IPv6 header with a new extension.  In SR networks, a PCE can
      be used to compute paths using SR PCEP extension.  This document
      specifies additional capability to advertise a PCE that supports the
      new SR PCEP extension.

  "The DNS Extended Server Diagnostics (ESD) Option", Evan Hunt,
  2013-07-31, <draft-hunt-dns-server-diagnostics-00.txt>

      The widespread adoption of DNSSEC implies more frequent DNSSEC
      failures.  Unfortunately, DNSSEC's failure mode is largely opaque to
      the client: when validation fails, the only signal that the clients
      of a validating resolver receive is an empty response with a SERVFAIL
      response code.  This note proposes a protocol extension to allow
      SERVFAIL responses to include additional diagnostic information,
      giving the client greater insight into what went wrong and a better
      chance of delivering useful problem reports to DNS operators.

  "Generic Opportunistic Routing Framework", Anders Lindgren, Elwyn
  Davies, Avri Doria, 2013-07-31, <draft-lindgren-dtnrg-gorf-00.txt>

      This document defines GORF, a Generic Opportunistic Routing
      Framework.  GORF specifies all necessary basic functionality that is
      common for all utility-based routing protocols that are variants of
      the epidemic routing protocol for intermittently connected networks
      that operates by pruning the epidemic distribution tree to minimize
      resource usage while still attempting to achieve the best case
      routing capabilities of epidemic routing.  It is intended for use in
      sparse mesh networks where there is no guarantee that a fully
      connected path between source and destination exists at any time,
      rendering traditional routing protocols unable to deliver messages
      between hosts.  These networks are examples of networks where there
      is a disparity between the latency requirements of applications and
      the capabilities of the underlying network (networks often referred
      to as Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant).  The document presents an
      architectural overview followed by the protocol specification.

  "Epidemic Routing Module for Generic Opportunistic Routing Framework",
  Anders Lindgren, Elwyn Davies, Avri Doria, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-lindgren-dtnrg-gorf-epidemic-00.txt>

      This document defines a routing algorithm module for GORF, the
      Generic Opportunistic Routing Framework, as defined in
      draft-lindgren-dtnrg-gorf-00.  This module specifies the Epidemic
      Routing algorithm for that framework.

  "RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XR) for Bytes Discarded
  Metric", Varun Singh, Joerg Ott, Igor Curcio, 2013-08-01,
  <draft-singh-xrblock-rtcp-xr-bytes-discarded-metric-00.txt>

      The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction with the Real-
      time Transport Protocol (RTP) in to provide a variety of short-term
      and long-term reception statistics.  The available reporting may
      include aggregate information across longer periods of time as well
      as individual packet reporting.  This document specifies a report
      computing the bytes discarded from the de-jitter buffer after
      successful reception.

  "IPv6 Stateless Fragmentation Identification Options", Mark Andrews,
  2013-08-01, <draft-andrews-6man-fragopt-00.txt>

      Fragmented IPv6 packets are often dropped because there is no way to
      identify whether a fragment matches a otherwise permitted packet as
      the L4 header information is not available on all the fragments.
      
      The document defines hop-by-hop options that can be used to supply
      the missing information in non initial fragments.

  "Characterization of Proposed Standards", Olaf Kolkman, Scott Bradner,
  Sean Turner, 2013-08-01,
  <draft-kolkman-proposed-standards-clarified-00.txt>

      This document clarifies the description of the review performed on
      and the maturity level of IETF Proposed Standard RFCs.

  "Standardising Structure in URIs", Mark Nottingham, 2013-08-01,
  <draft-nottingham-uri-get-off-my-lawn-00.txt>

      It is sometimes attractive to specify a particular structure for URIs
      (or parts thereof) to add support for a new feature, application or
      facility.  This memo provides guidelines for such situations in
      standards documents.

  "6bed4: Peer-to-Peer IPv6 on Any Internetwork", Rick van Rein,
  2013-08-01, <draft-vanrein-6bed4-00.txt>

      The purpose of 6bed4 is to support IPv6-only applications, even on
      IPv4-only networks.  A specific area of concern is that of peer-to-
      peer protocols such as SIP or document exchange during a chat
      session.  Such protocols are designed to run in any environment,
      which means that they cannot rely on IPv6 for themselves, or for
      their peers.  The 6bed4 tunnel mechanism ensures that IPv6 can be
      assumed on all peers.
      
      The 6bed4 mechanism is meant as a fallback mechanism for IPv6
      connectivity on networks that do not support it natively, by running
      a tunnel over UDP and IPv4.  The IPv4 address is used to support
      traceability of the traffic originator, which means that no user
      account or other configuration is needed.
      
      The tunnel mechanism encapsulates IPv6 in UDP/IPv4 and builds on
      existing IPv6 mechanisms; it employs Stateless Address
      Autoconfiguration [RFC4862] to setup an IPv6 address on a 6bed4 Peer,
      and Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] to find the most direct route to a
      remote 6bed4 Peer.

  "Updates to DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 Options for Access Network Discovery and
  Selection Function (ANDSF) Discovery", Mohamed Boucadair, 2013-08-02,
  <draft-boucadair-rfc6153-update-00.txt>

      This document updates RFC 6153 by correcting IANA allocations made
      for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options for Access Network Discovery and
      Selection Function (ANDSF) Discovery.  This document assigns a code
      for DHCPv6 option for ANDSF and withdraws an already assigned DHCPv4
      option code.

  "VRRP Graceful Failover", Anurag Kothari, 2013-08-02,
  <draft-kothari-vrrp-graceful-failover-00.txt>

      This memo defines the use of priority zero in VRRP to failover from
      the Master router to one of the Backup routers either by operator
      input (i.e. manual failover) or automatically (e.g. on uplink
      interface going down). The procedure tries to be graceful (i.e.
      minimize outage) wherever possible. It is especially helpful in cases
      where preemption is disabled to avoid unnecessary churn.

Network Time Protocol (ntp)
---------------------------

  "Network Time Security", Dieter Sibold, Stephen Roettger, 2013-07-07,
  <draft-ietf-ntp-network-time-security-00.txt>

      This document describes the Network Time Security (NTS) protocol that
      enables secure authentication of time servers using Network Time
      Protocol (NTP) or Precision Time Protocol (PTP).  Its design
      considers the special requirements of precise timekeeping, which are
      described in Security Requirements of Time Protocols in Packet
      Switched Network [I-D.ietf-tictoc-security-requirements].

Network Virtualization Overlays (nvo3)
--------------------------------------

  "Problem Statement: Overlays for Network Virtualization", Thomas Narten,
  Eric Gray, David Black, Luyuan Fang, Lawrence Kreeger, Maria Napierala,
  2013-07-31, <draft-ietf-nvo3-overlay-problem-statement-04.txt>

      This document describes issues associated with providing multi-
      tenancy in large data center networks and how these issues may be
      addressed using an overlay-based network virtualization approach.  A
      key multi-tenancy requirement is traffic isolation, so that one
      tenant's traffic is not visible to any other tenant.  Another
      requirement is address space isolation, so that different tenants can
      use the same address space within different virtual networks.
      Traffic and address space isolation is achieved by assigning one or
      more virtual networks to each tenant, where traffic within a virtual
      network can only cross into another virtual network in a controlled
      fashion (e.g., via a configured router and/or a security gateway).
      Additional functionality is required to provision virtual networks,
      associating a virtual machine's network interface(s) with the
      appropriate virtual network, and maintaining that association as the
      virtual machine is activated, migrated and/or deactivated.  Use of an
      overlay-based approach enables scalable deployment on large network
      infrastructures.

  "Framework for DC Network Virtualization", Marc Lasserre, Florin Balus,
  Thomas Morin, Nabil Bitar, Yakov Rekhter, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-ietf-nvo3-framework-03.txt>

      Several IETF drafts relate to the use of overlay networks to support
      large scale virtual data centers. This draft provides a framework
      for Network Virtualization over L3 (NVO3) and is intended to help
      plan a set of work items in order to provide a complete solution
      set. It defines a logical view of the main components with the
      intention of streamlining the terminology and focusing the solution
      set.

  "NVO3 Data Plane Requirements", Nabil Bitar, Marc Lasserre, Florin
  Balus, Thomas Morin, Lizhong Jin, Bhumip Khasnabish, 2013-07-01,

  "Network-related VM Mobility Issues", Yakov Rekhter, Wim Henderickx,
  Ravi Shekhar, Luyuan Fang, Linda Dunbar, Ali Sajassi, 2013-06-10,
  <draft-ietf-nvo3-vm-mobility-issues-01.txt>

      This document describes a set of network-related issues presented by
      the desire to support seamless Virtual Machine mobility in the data
      center and between data centers. In particular, it looks at the
      implications of meeting the requirements for "seamless mobility".

  "Use Cases for DC Network Virtualization Overlays", Lucy Yong, Mehmet
  Toy, Aldrin Isaac, Vishwas Manral, Linda Dunbar, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-ietf-nvo3-use-case-02.txt>

      This document describes the DC Network Virtualization (NVO3) use
      cases that may be potentially deployed in various data centers and
      apply to different applications.

  "Network Virtualization NVE to NVA Control Protocol Requirements",
  Lawrence Kreeger, Dinesh Dutt, Thomas Narten, David Black, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-ietf-nvo3-nve-nva-cp-req-00.txt>

      The document "Problem Statement: Overlays for Network Virtualization"
      discusses the needs for network virtualization using overlay networks
      in highly virtualized data centers.  The problem statement outlines a
      need for control protocols to facilitate running these overlay
      networks.  This document outlines the high level requirements to be
      fulfilled by the control protocols related to building and managing
      the mapping tables and other state information used by the Network
      Virtualization Edge to transmit encapsulated packets across the
      underlying network.

Web Authorization Protocol (oauth)
----------------------------------

  "SAML 2.0 Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization
  Grants", Brian Campbell, Chuck Mortimore, Michael Jones, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-oauth-saml2-bearer-17.txt,.pdf>

      This specification defines the use of a SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion as
      a means for requesting an OAuth 2.0 access token as well as for use
      as a means of client authentication.

  "OAuth 2.0 Message Authentication Code (MAC) Tokens", Justin Richer,
  William Mills, Hannes Tschofenig, Phil Hunt, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac-04.txt>

      This specification describes how to use MAC Tokens in HTTP requests
      to access OAuth 2.0 protected resources.  An OAuth client willing to
      access a protected resource needs to demonstrate possession of a
      crytographic key by using it with a keyed message digest function to
      the request.
      
      The document also defines a key distribution protocol for obtaining a
      fresh session key.

  "Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and
  Authorization Grants", Brian Campbell, Chuck Mortimore, Michael Jones,
  Yaron Goland, 2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-oauth-assertions-12.txt,.pdf>

      This specification provides a framework for the use of assertions
      with OAuth 2.0 in the form of a new client authentication mechanism
      and a new authorization grant type.  Mechanisms are specified for
      transporting assertions during interactions with a token endpoint, as
      well as general processing rules.
      
      The intent of this specification is to provide a common framework for
      OAuth 2.0 to interwork with other identity systems using assertions,
      and to provide alternative client authentication mechanisms.
      
      Note that this specification only defines abstract message flows and
      processing rules.  In order to be implementable, companion
      specifications are necessary to provide the corresponding concrete
      instantiations.

  "JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and
  Authorization Grants", Michael Jones, Brian Campbell, Chuck Mortimore,
  2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-bearer-06.txt,.pdf>

      This specification defines the use of a JSON Web Token (JWT) Bearer
      Token as a means for requesting an OAuth 2.0 access token as well as
      for use as a means of client authentication.

  "JSON Web Token (JWT)", Michael Jones, John Bradley, Nat Sakimura,
  2013-07-29, <draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-11.txt,.pdf>

      JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact URL-safe means of representing
      claims to be transferred between two parties.  The claims in a JWT
      are encoded as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object that is
      used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the
      plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the
      claims to be digitally signed or MACed and/or encrypted.
      
      The suggested pronunciation of JWT is the same as the English word
      "jot".

  "OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol", Justin Richer, John
  Bradley, Michael Jones, Maciej Machulak, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-oauth-dyn-reg-14.txt>

      This specification defines an endpoint and protocol for dynamic
      registration of OAuth 2.0 clients at an authorization server and
      methods for the dynamically registered client to manage its
      registration through an OAuth 2.0 protected web API.

  "OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation", Torsten Lodderstedt, Stefanie Dronia,
  Marius Scurtescu, 2013-07-13, <draft-ietf-oauth-revocation-11.txt>

      This document proposes an additional endpoint for OAuth authorization
      servers, which allows clients to notify the authorization server that
      a previously obtained refresh or access token is no longer needed.
      This allows the authorization server to cleanup security credentials.
      A revocation request will invalidate the actual token and, if
      applicable, other tokens based on the same authorization grant.

Operations and Management Area Working Group (opsawg)
-----------------------------------------------------

  "An Overview of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
  Mechanisms", Tal Mizrahi, Nurit Sprecher, Elisa Bellagamba, Yaacov
  Weingarten, 2013-07-08, <draft-ietf-opsawg-oam-overview-09.txt>

      Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a general term
      that refers to a toolset for fault detection and isolation, and for
      performance measurement. OAM mechanisms have been defined for various
      layers in the protocol stack, and are used with a variety of
      transport protocols.
      
      This document presents an overview of the data plane OAM tools that
      have been defined by the IETF.

  "CGN Deployment with BGP/MPLS IP VPNs", Victor Kuarsingh, John
  Cianfarani, 2013-06-27, <draft-ietf-opsawg-lsn-deployment-03.txt>

      This document specifies a framework to integrate a Network Address
      Translation layer into an operator's network to function as a Carrier
      Grade NAT (also known as CGN or Large Scale NAT).  The CGN
      infrastructure will often form a NAT444 environment as the subscriber
      home network will likely also maintain a subscriber side NAT
      function.  Exhaustion of the IPv4 address pool is a major driver
      compelling some operators to implement CGN.  Although operators may
      wish to deploy IPv6 to strategically overcome IPv4 exhaustion, near
      term needs may not be satisfied with an IPv6 deployment alone.  This
      document provides a practical integration model which allows the CGN
      platform to be integrated into the network meeting the connectivity
      needs of the subscriber while being mindful of not disrupting
      existing services and meeting the technical challenges that CGN
      brings.  The model included in this document utilizes BGP/MPLS IP
      VPNs which allow for virtual routing separation helping ease the CGNs
      impact on the network.  This document does not intend to defend the
      merits of CGN.

  "Ethernet in the First Mile Copper (EFMCu) Interfaces MIB", Edward
  Beili, 2013-06-25, <draft-ietf-opsawg-rfc5066bis-03.txt>

      This document updates RFC 5066.  It amends that specification by
      informing the internet community about the transition of the EFM-CU-
      MIB module from the IETF Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB Working
      Group to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
      802.3 working group.

  "Mechanisms for Optimal LAG/ECMP Component Link Utilization in
  Networks", ramki, Sanjay Khanna, Lucy Yong, Anoop Ghanwani, So Ning,
  Bhumip Khasnabish, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-ietf-opsawg-large-flow-load-balancing-04.txt>

      Demands on networking infrastructure are growing exponentially; the
      drivers are bandwidth hungry rich media applications, inter-data
      center communications, etc. In this context, it is important to
      optimally use the bandwidth in wired networks that extensively use
      LAG/ECMP techniques for bandwidth scaling. This draft explores some
      of the mechanisms useful for achieving this.

  "Hybrid-MAC Model for CAPWAP", Chunju Shao, Hui Deng, Farooq Bari, Rong
  Zhang, Satoru Matsushima, 2013-05-08,
  <draft-ietf-opsawg-capwap-hybridmac-00.txt>

      The CAPWAP protocol supports two modes of operation: Split and Local
      MAC (medium access control), which has been described in
      [RFC5415].There are many functions in IEEE 802l.11 MAC layer that
      have not yet been clearly defined whether they belong to either the
      WTP (Wireless Termination Points) or the AC (Access Controller)in the
      Split and Local modes.  Because different vendors have their own
      definition of these two models, depending upon the vendor many MAC
      layer functions continue to be mapped differently to either the WTP
      or AC.  If there is no clear definition of split MAC and local MAC,
      then operators will not only need to perform vendor specific
      configurations in their network but will continue to experience
      difficulty in interoperating WTPs and ACs from different vendors.

  "CAPWAP Extension for 802.11n and Power/channel Reconfiguration", Yifan
  Chen, Dapeng Liu, Hui Deng, Lei Zhu, 2013-05-09,
  <draft-ietf-opsawg-capwap-extension-00.txt>

      CAPWAP binding for 802.11 is specified by RFC5416 and it was based on
      IEEE 802-11.2007 standard.  After RFC5416 was published in 2009,
      there was several new amendent of 802.11 has been published.  802.11n
      is one of those amendent and it has been widely used in real
      deployment.  This document extends the CAPWAP binding for 802.11 to
      support 802.11n.

      This document provides advice on the filtering of IPv4 packets based
      on the IPv4 options they contain.  Additionally, it discusses the
      operational and interoperability implications of dropping packets
      based on the IP options they contain.

  "Using Only Link-Local Addressing Inside an IPv6 Network", Michael
  Behringer, Eric Vyncke, 2013-02-15, <draft-ietf-opsec-lla-only-03.txt>

      In an IPv6 network it is possible to use only link-local addresses on
      infrastructure links between routers.  This document discusses the
      advantages and disadvantages of this approach to help the decision
      process for a given network.

  "Security Implications of IPv6 on IPv4 Networks", Fernando Gont, Will
  Liu, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-ietf-opsec-ipv6-implications-on-ipv4-nets-05.txt>

      This document discusses the security implications of native IPv6
      support and IPv6 transition/co-existence technologies on "IPv4-only"
      networks, and describes possible mitigations for the aforementioned
      issues.

  "Operational Security Considerations for IPv6 Networks", KK
  Chittimaneni, Merike Kaeo, Eric Vyncke, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-opsec-v6-03.txt>

      Knowledge and experience on how to operate IPv4 securely is
      available: whether it is the Internet or an enterprise internal
      network.  However, IPv6 presents some new security challenges.  RFC
      4942 describes the security issues in the protocol but network
      managers also need a more practical, operations-minded best common
      practices.
      
      This document analyzes the operational security issues in all places
      of a network (service providers, enterprises and residential users)
      and proposes technical and procedural mitigations techniques.

  "Virtual Private Network (VPN) traffic leakages in dual-stack hosts/
  networks", Fernando Gont, 2013-06-24,
  <draft-ietf-opsec-vpn-leakages-01.txt>

      The subtle way in which the IPv6 and IPv4 protocols co-exist in
      typical networks, together with the lack of proper IPv6 support in
      popular Virtual Private Network (VPN) products, may inadvertently
      result in VPN traffic leaks.  That is, traffic meant to be
      transferred over a VPN connection may leak out of such connection and
      be transferred in the clear from the local network to the final
      destination.  This document discusses some scenarios in which such
      VPN leakages may occur, either as a side effect of enabling IPv6 on a
      local network, or as a result of a deliberate attack from a local
      attacker.  Additionally, it discusses possible mitigations for the
      aforementioned issue.

  "Network Reconnaissance in IPv6 Networks", Fernando Gont, Tim Chown,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-opsec-ipv6-host-scanning-02.txt>

      IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4
      counterpart.  The standard /64 IPv6 subnets can (in theory)
      accommodate approximately 1.844 * 10^19 hosts, thus resulting in a
      much lower host density (#hosts/#addresses) than is typical in IPv4
      networks, where a site typically has 65,000 or less unique addresses.
      As a result, it is widely assumed that it would take a tremendous
      effort to perform address scanning attacks against IPv6 networks, and
      therefore classic IPv6 address scanning attacks have been considered
      unfeasible.  This document updates RFC 5157 by providing further
      analysis on how traditional address scanning techniques apply to IPv6
      networks, and exploring some additional techniques that can be
      employed for IPv6 network reconnaissance.  In doing so, this document
      formally obsoletes RFC 5157.

  "BGP operations and security", Jerome Durand, Ivan Pepelnjak, Gert
  Doering, 2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-opsec-bgp-security-01.txt>

      BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the protocol almost exclusively used
      in the Internet to exchange routing information between network
      domains.  Due to this central nature, it's important to understand
      the security measures that can and should be deployed to prevent
      accidental or intentional routing disturbances.
      
      This document describes measures to protect the BGP sessions itself
      (like TTL, MD5, control plane filtering) and to better control the
      flow of routing information, using prefix filtering and
      automatization of prefix filters, max-prefix filtering, AS path
      filtering, route flap dampening and BGP community scrubbing.

  "OSPF Transport Instance Extensions", Acee Lindem, Abhay Roy, Sina
  Mirtorabi, 2013-04-05, <draft-ietf-ospf-transport-instance-10.txt>

      OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 include a reliable flooding mechanism to
      disseminate routing topology and Traffic Engineering (TE) information
      within a routing domain.  Given the effectiveness of these
      mechanisms, it is convenient to envision using the same mechanism for
      dissemination of other types of information within the domain.
      However, burdening OSPF with this additional information will impact
      intra-domain routing convergence and possibly jeopardize the
      stability of the OSPF routing domain.  This document presents
      mechanism to relegate this ancillary information to a separate OSPF
      instance and minimize the impact.

  "Security Extension for OSPFv2 when using Manual Key Management", Manav
  Bhatia, Sam Hartman, Dacheng Zhang, Acee Lindem, 2013-05-27,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-security-extension-manual-keying-05.txt>

      The current OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication mechanism as defined
      in the OSPF standards is vulnerable to both inter-session and intra-
      session replay attacks when its uses manual keying.  Additionally,
      the existing cryptographic authentication schemes do not cover the IP
      header.  This omission can be exploited to carry out various types of
      attacks.
      
      This draft proposes changes to the authentication sequence number
      mechanism that will protect OSPFv2 from both inter-session and intra-
      session replay attacks when its using manual keys for securing its
      protocol packets.  Additionally, we also describe some changes in the
      cryptographic hash computation so that we eliminate most attacks that
      result because OSPFv2 does not protect the IP header.

  "OSPF Stub Router Advertisement", Alvaro Retana, Liem Nguyen, Alex
  Zinin, Russ White, Danny McPherson, 2013-04-23,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-rfc3137bis-04.txt>

      This document describes a backward-compatible technique that may be
      used by OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) implementations to advertise
      a router's unavailability to forward transit traffic, or to lower the
      preference level for the paths through such a router.
      
      This document obsoletes [RFC3137].

  "Use of OSPF-MDR in Single-Hop Broadcast Networks", Richard Ogier,
  2013-06-03, <draft-ietf-ospf-manet-single-hop-mdr-03.txt>

      RFC 5614 (OSPF-MDR) extends OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks
      (MANETs) by specifying its operation on the new OSPF interface of type
      MANET.  This document describes the use of OSPF-MDR in a single-hop
      broadcast network, which is a special case of a MANET in which each
      router is a (one-hop) neighbor of each other router.  Unlike an OSPF
      broadcast interface, such an interface can have a different cost
      associated with each neighbor.  The document includes configuration
      recommendations and simplified mechanisms that can be used in single-hop
      broadcast networks.

  "OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions", Spencer Giacalone,
  David Ward, John Drake, Alia Atlas, Stefano Previdi, 2013-06-03,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-te-metric-extensions-04.txt,.pdf>

      In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
      information networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network
      performance criteria (e.g. latency) are becoming as critical to data
      path selection as other metrics.
      
      This document describes extensions to OSPF TE [RFC3630] such that
      network performance information can be distributed and collected in a
      scalable fashion. The information distributed using OSPF TE Metric
      Extensions can then be used to make path selection decisions based on
      network performance.
      
      Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which network
      performance information is distributed. The mechanisms for measuring
      network performance or acting on that information, once distributed,
      are outside the scope of this document.

  "Use of the OSPF-MANET Interface in Single-Hop Broadcast Networks",
  Alvaro Retana, Stan Ratliff, 2013-05-13,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-manet-single-hop-or-02.txt>

      This document describes the use of the OSPF-MANET interface in
      single-hop broadcast networks.  It includes a mechanism to
      dynamically determine the presence of such a network and specific
      operational considerations due to its nature.
      
      This document updates [RFC5820].

  "OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration", Acee Lindem, Jari Arkko, 2013-04-15,
  <draft-ietf-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig-02.txt>

      OSPFv3 is a candidate for deployments in environments where auto-
      configuration is a requirement.  One such environment is the IPv6
      home network where users expect to simply plug in a router and have
      it automatically use OSPFv3 for intra-domain routing.  This document
      describes the necessary mechanisms for OSPFv3 to be self-configuring.

Peer-to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (p2psip)
-------------------------------------------------

  "Concepts and Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP", David Bryan, Philip
  Matthews, Eunsoo Shim, Dean Willis, Spencer Dawkins, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-concepts-05.txt>

      This document defines concepts and terminology for the use of the
      Session Initiation Protocol in a peer-to-peer environment where the
      traditional proxy-registrar and message routing functions are
      replaced by a distributed mechanism.  These mechanisms may be
      implemented using a distributed hash table or other distributed data
      mechanism with similar external properties.  This document includes a
      high-level view of the functional relationships between the network
      elements defined herein, a conceptual model of operations, and an
      outline of the related problems addressed by the P2PSIP working group
      and the RELOAD protocol ([I-D.ietf-p2psip-base],
      [I-D.ietf-p2psip-sip]) defined by the working group.

  "A SIP Usage for RELOAD", Cullen Jennings, Bruce Lowekamp, Eric
  Rescorla, Salman Baset, Henning Schulzrinne, Thomas Schmidt, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-sip-11.txt>

      This document defines a SIP Usage for REsource LOcation And Discovery
      (RELOAD).  The SIP Usage provides the functionality of a SIP proxy or
      registrar in a fully-distributed system and includes a lookup service
      for Address of Records (AORs) stored in the overlay.  It also defines
      Globally Routable User Agent Uris (GRUUs) that allow the
      registrations to map an AOR to a specific node reachable through the
      overlay.  After such initial contact of a peer, the AppAttach method
      is used to establish a direct connection between nodes through which
      SIP messages are exchanged.

  "REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol", Cullen
  Jennings, Bruce Lowekamp, Eric Rescorla, Salman Baset, Henning
  Schulzrinne, 2013-02-24, <draft-ietf-p2psip-base-26.txt>

      This specification defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD),
      a peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet.  A
      P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage
      and messaging service between a set of cooperating peers that form
      the overlay network.  RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session
      Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other
      applications with similar requirements by defining new usages that
      specify the kinds of data that needs to be stored for a particular
      application.  RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificate
      enrollment service that provides unique identities.  NAT traversal is
      a fundamental service of the protocol.  RELOAD also allows access
      from "client" nodes that do not need to route traffic or store data
      for others.

  "P2P Overlay Diagnostics", Haibin Song, XingFeng Jiang, Roni Even, David
  Bryan, 2013-03-24, <draft-ietf-p2psip-diagnostics-11.txt>

      This document describes mechanisms for P2P overlay diagnostics.  It
      defines extensions to the RELOAD P2PSIP base protocol RELOAD
      [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] to collect diagnostic information, and details
      the protocol specifications for these extensions.  Useful diagnostic
      information for connection and node status monitoring is also
      defined.  The document also describes the usage scenarios and
      provides examples of how these methods are used to perform
      diagnostics in a P2PSIP overlay networks.

  "A Self-tuning Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for REsource LOcation And
  Discovery (RELOAD)", Jouni Maenpaa, Gonzalo Camarillo, 2013-02-16,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-self-tuning-08.txt>

      REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) is a peer-to-peer (P2P)
      signaling protocol that provides an overlay network service.  Peers
      in a RELOAD overlay network collectively run an overlay algorithm to
      organize the overlay, and to store and retrieve data.  This document
      describes how the default topology plugin of RELOAD can be extended
      to support self-tuning, that is, to adapt to changing operating
      conditions such as churn and network size.

  "Service Discovery Usage for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD)",
  Jouni Maenpaa, Gonzalo Camarillo, 2013-02-23,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-service-discovery-08.txt>

      REsource LOcation and Discovery (RELOAD) does not define a generic
      service discovery mechanism as a part of the base protocol.  This
      document defines how the Recursive Distributed Rendezvous (ReDiR)
      service discovery mechanism used in OpenDHT can be applied to RELOAD
      overlays to provide a generic service discovery mechanism.

  "An extension to RELOAD to support Relay Peer Routing", Ning Zong,
  XingFeng Jiang, Roni Even, Yunfei Zhang, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-rpr-08.txt>

      This document proposes an optional extension to RELOAD to support
      relay peer routing mode.  RELOAD recommends symmetric recursive
      routing for routing messages.  The new optional extension provides a
      shorter route for responses reducing the overhead on intermediate
      peers and describes the potential use cases where this extension can
      be used.

  "An extension to RELOAD to support Direct Response Routing", Ning Zong,
  XingFeng Jiang, Roni Even, Yunfei Zhang, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-drr-08.txt>

      This document proposes an optional extension to RELOAD to support
      direct response routing mode.  RELOAD recommends symmetric recursive
      routing for routing messages.  The new optional extension provides a
      shorter route for responses reducing the overhead on intermediate
      peers and describes the potential cases where this extension can be
      used.

  "A Usage for Shared Resources in RELOAD (ShaRe)", Alexander Knauf,
  Thomas Schmidt, Gabriel Hege, Matthias Waehlisch, 2013-02-24,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-share-01.txt>

      This document defines a RELOAD Usage for managing shared write access
      to RELOAD Resources.  Shared Resources in RELOAD (ShaRe) form a basic
      primitive for enabling various coordination and notification schemes
      among distributed peers.  Access in ShaRe is controlled by a
      hierarchical trust delegation scheme maintained within an access
      list.  A new USER-CHAIN-ACL access policy allows authorized peers to
      write a Shared Resource without owning its corresponding certificate.
      This specification also adds mechanisms to store Resources with a
      variable name which is useful whenever peer-independent rendezvous
      processes are required.

  "A RELOAD Usage for Distributed Conference Control (DisCo)", Alexander
  Knauf, Thomas Schmidt, Gabriel Hege, Matthias Waehlisch, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-disco-02.txt>

      This document defines a RELOAD Usage for Distributed Conference
      Control (DisCo) with SIP.  DisCo preserves conference addressing
      through a single SIP URI by splitting its semantic of identifier and
      locator using a new Kind data structure.  Conference members are
      enabled to select conference controllers based on proximity awareness
      and to recover from failures of individual resource instances.  DisCo
      proposes call delegation to balance the load at focus peers.

  "Configuration of Access Control Policy in REsource LOcation And
  Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol", Marc Petit-Huguenin, 2013-02-16,
  <draft-ietf-p2psip-access-control-00.txt>

      This document describes an extension to the REsource LOcation And
      Discovery (RELOAD) base protocol to distribute the code of new Access
      Control Policies without having to upgrade the RELOAD implementations
      in an overlay.

Protocol to Access WS database (paws)
-------------------------------------

  "Protocol to Access Spectrum Database", Vincent Chen, Subir Das, Lei
  Zhu, John Malyar, Pete McCann, 2013-06-19,
  <draft-ietf-paws-protocol-06.txt>

      Portions of the radio spectrum that are allocated to licensees are
      available for non-interfering use.  This available spectrum is called
      "White Space."  Allowing secondary users access to available spectrum
      "unlocks" existing spectrum to maximize its utilization and to
      provide opportunities for innovation, resulting in greater overall
      spectrum utilization.
      
      One approach to manage spectrum sharing uses databases to report
      spectrum availability to devices.  To achieve interoperability among
      multiple devices and databases, a standardized protocol must be
      defined and implemented.  This document defines such a protocol, the
      "Protocol to Access White Space database" (PAWS).

Audio/Video Transport Payloads (payload)

      This document specifies a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload
      format to be used for the low complexity subband codec (SBC), which
      is the mandatory audio codec of the Advanced Audio Distribution
      Profile (A2DP) Specification written by the Bluetooth(r) Special
      Interest Group (SIG). The payload format is designed to be able to
      interoperate with existing Bluetooth A2DP devices, to provide high
      streaming audio quality, interactive audio transmission over the
      internet, and ultra-low delay coding for jam sessions on the
      internet. This document contains also a media type registration
      which specifies the use of the RTP payload format.

      payloads typically used in IP networks.  This document also defines a
      storage mode format for G.711.0 and a media type registration for the
      G.711.0 RTP payload format.

  "RTP Payload Format for High Efficiency Video Coding", Ye-Kui Wang, Yago
  Sanchez, Thomas Schierl, Stephan Wenger, Miska Hannuksela, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-ietf-payload-rtp-h265-00.txt>

      This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding
      standard  ITU-T  Recommendation  H.265  and  ISO/IEC  International
      Standard 23008-2, both also known as High Efficiency Video Coding
      (HEVC) [HEVC], developed by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video
      Coding (JCT-VC).  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of

  Ogaki, Diego Caviglia, Fatai Zhang, Cyril Margaria, 2013-07-22,
  <draft-ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req-09.txt>

      The initial effort of the PCE (Path computation element) WG was
      mainly focused on MPLS.  As a next step, this draft describes
      functional requirements for GMPLS application of PCE.

  "PCE communication protocol (PCEP) Management Information Base", Kiran
  Koushik, Emile Stephan, Quintin Zhao, Daniel King, Jonathan Hardwick,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-pce-pcep-mib-05.txt>

      This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
      Information Base for use with network management protocols in the
      Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects for
      modeling of Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP)
      for communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path
      Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs.

  "Conveying Vendor-Specific Constraints in the Path Computation Element
  Protocol", Fatai Zhang, Adrian Farrel, 2013-04-22,
  <draft-ietf-pce-vendor-constraints-10.txt>

      The Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) is used to convey path
      computation requests and responses between Path Computation Clients
      (PCCs) and Path Computation Elements (PCEs), and also between
      cooperating PCEs.  In PCEP the path computation requests carry
      details of the constraints and objective functions that the PCC
      wishes the PCE to apply in its computation.
      
      This document defines a facility to carry vendor-specific information
      in PCEP using a dedicated object and a new Type-Length-Variable that
      can be carried in any existing PCEP object.

  "PCEP Requirements for WSON Routing and Wavelength Assignment", Young
  Lee, Greg Bernstein, Jonas Martensson, Tomonori Takeda, Takehiro
  Tsuritani, Oscar de Dios, 2013-06-27,
  <draft-ietf-pce-wson-routing-wavelength-09.txt>

      This memo provides application-specific requirements for the Path
      Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) for the support of
      Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON). Lightpath provisioning
      in WSONs requires a routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) process.
      From a path computation perspective, wavelength assignment is the
      process of determining which wavelength can be used on each hop of a
      path and forms an additional routing constraint to optical light
      path computation. Requirements for Optical impairments will be
      addressed in a separate document.

  "PCEP extensions for GMPLS", Cyril Margaria, Oscar de Dios, Fatai Zhang,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-pce-gmpls-pcep-extensions-08.txt>

      This memo provides extensions for the Path Computation Element
      communication Protocol (PCEP) for the support of GMPLS control plane.

  "Applicability of the Path Computation Element to Inter-Area and
  Inter-AS MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering", Daniel King, Julien
  Meuric, Olivier Dugeon, Quintin Zhao, Oscar de Dios, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-pce-inter-area-as-applicability-03.txt>

      The Path Computation Element (PCE) may be used for computing services
      that traverse multi-area and multi-AS Multiprotocol Label Switching
      (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered (TE) networks.
      
      This document examines the applicability of the PCE architecture,
      protocols, and protocol extensions for computing multi-area and
      multi-AS paths in MPLS and GMPLS networks.

  "PCE-based Computation Procedure To Compute Shortest Constrained P2MP

  Dhruv Dhody, Zafar Ali, Daniel King, Ramon Casellas, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-pce-pcep-inter-domain-p2mp-procedures-05.txt>

      The ability to compute paths for constrained point-to-multipoint
      (P2MP) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) across
      multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement for the
      deployment of P2MP services in MPLS and GMPLS-controlled networks.
      The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been recognized as an
      appropriate technology for the determination of inter-domain paths of
      P2MP TE LSPs.
      
      This document describes an experiment to provide procedures and
      extensions to the PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) for the
      computation of inter-domain paths for P2MP TE LSPs.

  "PCEP Extensions for Stateful PCE", Edward Crabbe, Jan Medved, Ina

      mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
      computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
      
      Although PCEP explicitly makes no assumptions regarding the
      information available to the PCE, it also makes no provisions for
      synchronization or PCE control of timing and sequence of path
      computations within and across PCEP sessions.  This document
      describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of
      MPLS-TE and GMPLS LSPs via PCEP.

  "Standard Representation Of Domain-Sequence", Dhruv Dhody, Udayasree
  Palle, Ramon Casellas, 2013-07-09,
  <draft-ietf-pce-pcep-domain-sequence-03.txt>

      The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label
      Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
      Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been
      identified as a key requirement.  In this context, a domain is a
      collection of network elements within a common sphere of address
      management or path computational responsibility such as an Interior
      Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an Autonomous Systems (AS).  This
      document specifies a standard representation and encoding of a
      Domain-Sequence, which is defined as an ordered sequence of domains
      traversed to reach the destination domain to be used by Path
      Computation Elements (PCEs) to compute inter-domain shortest
      constrained paths across a predetermined sequence of domains .  This
      document also defines new subobjects to be used to encode domain
      identifiers.

  "Extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
  (PCEP) to compute service aware Label Switched Path (LSP).", Dhruv
  Dhody, Vishwas Manral, Zafar Ali, George Swallow, Kenji Kumaki,
  2013-07-09, <draft-ietf-pce-pcep-service-aware-01.txt>

      In certain networks like financial information network (stock/
      commodity trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications,
      Latency (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet Loss is
      becoming a key requirement for path computation along with other
      constraints and metrics.  Latency, Latency-Variation and Packet Loss
      is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between
      customers and service providers.
      
      [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS] describes mechanisms with
      which network performance information is distributed via OSPF and
      ISIS respectively.  The Path Computation Element Communication
      Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements
      (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation
      Clients (PCCs) requests.  This document describes the extension to
      PCEP to carry Latency, Latency-Variation and Loss as constraints for
      end to end path computation.

  "PCEP Extension for WSON Routing and Wavelength Assignment", Young Lee,
  Ramon Casellas, 2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-pce-wson-rwa-ext-01.txt>

      This document provides the Path Computation Element communication
      Protocol (PCEP) extensions for the support of Routing and Wavelength
      Assignment (RWA) in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON).
      Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a routing and wavelength
      assignment (RWA) process.  From a path computation perspective,
      wavelength assignment is the process of determining which wavelength
      can be used on each hop of a path and forms an additional routing
      constraint to optical light path computation.

  "Unanswered Questions in the Path Computation Element Architecture",
  Adrian Farrel, Daniel King, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-ietf-pce-questions-00.txt>

      The Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture is set out in RFC
      4655. The architecture is extended for multi-layer networking with
      the introduction of the Virtual Network Topology Manager in RFC
      5623, and generalized to Hierarchical PCE in RFC 6805.
      
      These three architectural views of PCE deliberately leave some key
      questions unanswered especially with respect to the interactions
      between architectural components.  This document draws out those
      questions and discusses them in an architectural context with
      reference to other architectural components, existing protocols, and
      recent IETF work efforts.
      
      This document does not update the architecture documents and does not
      define how protocols or components must be used.  It does, however,
      suggest how the architectural components might be combined to provide
      advanced PCE function.

  "DHCP Options for the Port Control Protocol (PCP)", Mohamed Boucadair,
  Reinaldo Penno, Dan Wing, 2013-03-27, <draft-ietf-pcp-dhcp-07.txt>

      This document specifies DHCP (IPv4 and IPv6) options to configure
      hosts with Port Control Protocol (PCP) Server names.  The use of
      DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 depends on the PCP deployment scenario.

  "Port Control Protocol (PCP) Proxy Function", Mohamed Boucadair,
  Reinaldo Penno, Dan Wing, 2013-07-28, <draft-ietf-pcp-proxy-04.txt>

      This document specifies a new PCP functional element denoted as a PCP
      Proxy.  The PCP Proxy relays PCP requests received from PCP clients
      to upstream PCP server(s).  A typical deployment usage of this
      function is to help establish successful PCP communications for PCP
      clients that can not be configured with the address of a PCP server
      located more than one hop away.

  "PCP Server Selection", Mohamed Boucadair, Reinaldo Penno, Dan Wing,
  Prashanth Patil, Tirumaleswar Reddy, 2013-05-22,

      This document specifies the behavior to be followed by the PCP client
      to contact its PCP server(s) when one or several PCP server names are
      configured.  Multiple names may be configured to a PCP client in some
      deployment contexts such as multi-homing.
      
      This document updates RFC6887.

  "Learning NAT64 PREFIX64s using PCP", Mohamed Boucadair, 2013-07-30,
  <draft-ietf-pcp-nat64-prefix64-04.txt>

      This document defines a new PCP extension to learn the IPv6
      prefix(es) used by a PCP-controlled NAT64 device to build
      IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses.  This extension is needed for
      successful communications when IPv4 addresses are used in referrals.

  "PCP Description Option", Mohamed Boucadair, Reinaldo Penno, Dan Wing,

      This document defines an extension to PCP allowing clients to
      manipulate sets of ports as a whole.  This is accomplished by a new
      MAP option: PORT_SET.

  "The Port Control Protocol in Dual-Stack Lite environments", Francis
  Dupont, Tina Tsou, Jacni Qin, Margaret Wasserman, Dacheng Zhang,

      environments.

Protocol Independent Multicast (pim)
------------------------------------

  "IGMP/MLD-Based Explicit Membership Tracking Function for Multicast
  Routers", Hitoshi Asaeda, 2013-07-31,
  <draft-ietf-pim-explicit-tracking-07.txt>

      This document describes the IGMP/MLD-based explicit membership
      tracking function for multicast routers and IGMP/MLD proxy devices
      supporting IGMPv3/MLDv2.  The explicit membership tracking function
      contributes to saving network resources and shortening leave latency.

  "Protocol Independent Multicast DR Load Balancing", Yiqun Cai, Sri
  Vallepalli, Heidi Ou, Andy Green, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-pim-drlb-02.txt>

      On a multi-access network such as an Ethernet, one of the PIM routers
      is elected as a Designated Router (DR).  The PIM DR has two roles in
      the PIM protocol.  On the first hop network, the PIM DR is
      responsible for registering an active source to the RP if the group
      is operated in PIM SM.  On the last hop network, the PIM DR is
      responsible for tracking local multicast listeners and forwarding
      traffic to these listeners if the group is operated in PIM SM/SSM/DM.
      In this document, we propose a modification to the PIM protocol that
      allows more than one of these last hop routers to be selected so that
      the forwarding load can be distributed to and handled among these
      routers.  A router responsible for forwarding for a particular group
      is called a Group Designated Router (GDR).

  Krishnaswamy, Apoorva Karan, Vishal Arya, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-ietf-pim-explicit-rpf-vector-02.txt>

      This document defines a new Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) Vector
      TLV to build multicast trees via an explicit path sent in the PIM
      join.

Public-Key Infrastructure (X.509) (pkix)
----------------------------------------

  "Enrollment over Secure Transport", Max Pritikin, Peter Yee, Dan
  Harkins, 2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-pkix-est-08.txt>

      This document profiles certificate enrollment for clients using
      Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) messages over a secure
      transport.  This profile, called Enrollment over Secure Transport
      (EST), describes a simple yet functional certificate management
      protocol targeting Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) clients that need
      to acquire client certificates and associated Certification Authority
      (CA) certificate(s).  It also supports client-generated public/
      private key pairs as well as key pairs generated by the CA.

Peer to Peer Streaming Protocol (ppsp)
--------------------------------------

  "Survey of P2P Streaming Applications", Gu Yingjie, Ning Zong, Yunfei
  Zhang, Francesca Piccolo, Shihui Duan, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-ietf-ppsp-survey-05.txt>

      This document presents a survey of some of the most popular Peer-to-
      Peer (P2P) streaming applications on the Internet.  Main selection
      criteria have been popularity and availability of information on
      operation details at writing time.  In doing this, selected
      applications are not reviewed as a whole, but they are reviewed with
      main focus on the signaling and control protocol used to establish
      and maintain overlay connections among peers and to advertise and
      download streaming content.

  "Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol (PPSPP)", A. Bakker, Riccardo
  Petrocco, Victor Grishchenko, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-ppsp-peer-protocol-07.txt>

      The Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol (PPSPP) is a protocol for
      disseminating the same content to a group of interested parties in a
      streaming fashion.  PPSPP supports streaming of both pre-recorded
      (on-demand) and live audio/video content.  It is based on the peer-
      to-peer paradigm, where clients consuming the content are put on
      equal footing with the servers initially providing the content, to
      create a system where everyone can potentially provide upload
      bandwidth.  It has been designed to provide short time-till-playback
      for the end user, and to prevent disruption of the streams by
      malicious peers.  PPSPP has also been designed to be flexible and
      extensible.  It can use different mechanisms to optimize peer
      uploading, prevent freeriding, and work with different peer discovery
      schemes (centralized trackers or Distributed Hash Tables).  It
      supports multiple methods for content integrity protection and chunk
      addressing.  Designed as a generic protocol that can run on top of
      various transport protocols, it currently runs on top of UDP using
      LEDBAT for congestion control.

  "PPSP Tracker Protocol-Base Protocol (PPSP-TP/1.0)", Rui Cruz, Mario
  Nunes, Gu Yingjie, Jinwei Xia, Joao Taveira, Deng Lingli, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-ietf-ppsp-base-tracker-protocol-01.txt>

      This document specifies the base Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol-
      Tracker Protocol (PPSP-TP/1.0), an application-layer control
      (signaling) protocol for the exchange of meta information between
      trackers and peers.  The specification outlines the architecture of
      the protocol and its functionality, and describes message flows,
      message processing instructions, message formats, formal syntax and
      semantics.  The PPSP Tracker Protocol enables cooperating peers to
      form content streaming overlay networks to support near real-time
      Structured Media content delivery (audio, video, associated timed
      text and metadata), such as adaptive multi-rate, layered (scalable)
      and multi-view (3D) videos, in live, time-shifted and on-demand
      modes.

Preparation and Comparison of Internationalized Strings (precis)
----------------------------------------------------------------

  "PRECIS Framework: Preparation and Comparison of Internationalized
  Strings in Application Protocols", Peter Saint-Andre, Marc Blanchet,
  2013-07-10, <draft-ietf-precis-framework-09.txt>

      Application protocols using Unicode code points in protocol strings
      need to properly prepare such strings in order to perform valid
      comparison operations (e.g., for purposes of authentication or
      authorization).  This document defines a framework enabling
      application protocols to perform the preparation and comparison of
      internationalized strings (a.k.a.  "PRECIS") in a way that depends on
      the properties of Unicode code points and thus is agile with respect
      to versions of Unicode.  As a result, this framework provides a more
      sustainable approach to the handling of internationalized strings
      than the previous framework, known as Stringprep (RFC 3454).  A
      specification that reuses this framework can either directly use the
      PRECIS string classes or subclass the PRECIS string classes as
      needed.  This framework takes an approach similar to the revised
      internationalized domain names (IDNs) in applications (IDNA)
      technology (RFC 5890, RFC 5891, RFC 5892, RFC 5893, RFC 5894) and
      thus adheres to the high-level design goals described in the IAB's
      recommendations regarding IDNs (RFC 4690), albeit for application
      technologies other than the Domain Name System (DNS).  This document
      obsoletes RFC 3454.

  "Preparation and Comparison of Nicknames", Peter Saint-Andre,
  2013-07-10, <draft-ietf-precis-nickname-06.txt>

      This document describes how to prepare and compare Unicode strings
      representing nicknames, primarily for use within textual chatrooms.
      This profile is intended to be used by messaging and text
      conferencing technologies such as the Extensible Messaging and
      Presence Protocol (XMPP), the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP),
      and Centralized Conferencing (XCON).

  "Mapping characters for PRECIS classes", Yoshiro Yoneya, Takahiro
  NEMOTO, 2013-05-24, <draft-ietf-precis-mappings-02.txt>

      The framework for preparation and comparison of internationalized
      strings ("PRECIS") defines several classes of strings for preparation
      and comparison.  In the framework, case mapping is defined because
      many protocols handle case-sensitive or case-insensitive string
      comparison and therefore preparation of the string is mandatory.  As
      described in the mapping for Internationalized Domain Names in
      Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS problem statement, mappings for
      internationalized strings are not limited to case, but also width
      mapping and mapping of delimiters and other specials can be taken
      into consideration.  This document provides guidelines for authors of
      protocol profiles of the PRECIS framework and describes several
      mappings that can be applied between receiving user input and passing
      permitted code points to internationalized protocols.  The mappings
      described here are expected to be applied as Addtional mapping in the
      PRECIS framework.

  "Preparation and Comparison of Internationalized Strings Representing
  Simple User Names and Passwords", Peter Saint-Andre, Alexey Melnikov,
  2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-precis-saslprepbis-03.txt>

      This document describes how to handle Unicode strings representing
      simple user names and passwords, primarily for purposes of
      comparison.  This profile is intended to be used by Simple
      Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanisms (such as PLAIN
      and SCRAM-SHA-1), as well as other protocols that exchange simple
      user names or passwords.  This document obsoletes RFC 4013.

Pseudowire Emulation Edge to Edge (pwe3)
----------------------------------------

  "Dynamic Placement of Multi Segment Pseudowires", Luca Martini, Matthew
  Bocci, Florin Balus, 2013-06-19, <draft-ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw-17.txt>

      There is a requirement for service providers to be able to extend the
      reach of pseudowires (PW) across multiple Packet Switched Network
      domains. A Multi-Segment PW is defined as a set of two or more
      contiguous PW segments that behave and function as a single point-
      to-point PW. This document describes extensions to the PW control
      protocol to dynamically place the segments of the multi segment
      pseudowire among a set of Provider Edge (PE) routers.

  "MPLS and Ethernet OAM Interworking", Dinesh Mohan, Nabil Bitar, Ali
  Sajassi, Simon DeLord, Philippe Niger, Ray Qiu, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-eth-oam-iwk-08.txt>

      This document specifies the mapping of defect states between
      Ethernet Attachment Circuits (ACs) and associated Ethernet
      Pseudowires (PWs) connected in accordance to the PWE3 architecture
      to realize an end-to-end emulated Ethernet service. It standardizes
      the behavior of Provider Edges (PEs) with respect to Ethernet PW
      and AC defects.

  "Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol for L2VPN PE Redundancy", Luca
  Martini, Samer Salam, Ali Sajassi, Satoru Matsushima, 2013-02-21,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-iccp-11.txt>

      This document specifies an inter-chassis communication protocol
      (ICCP) that enables Provider Edge (PE) device redundancy for Virtual
      Private Wire Service (VPWS) and Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)
      applications. The protocol runs within a set of two or more PEs,
      forming a redundancy group, for the purpose of synchronizing data
      amongst the systems. It accommodates multi-chassis attachment circuit
      as well as pseudowire redundancy mechanisms.

  "MPLS LSP PW status refresh reduction for Static Pseudowires", Luca
  Martini, George Swallow, Elisa Bellagamba, 2013-02-20,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-status-reduction-01.txt>

      This document describes a method for generating an aggregated
      pseudowire status message on Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
      network Label Switched Path (LSP).
      
      The method for transmitting the pseudowire (PW) status information is
      not new, however this protocol extension allows a Service Provider
      (SP) to reliably monitor the individual PW status while not
      overwhelming the network of multiple periodic status messages. This
      is achieved by sending a single cumulative summary status
      verification message for all the PWs grouped in the same LSP.

  "The Pseudowire (PW) & Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)
  Implementation Survey Results", Andrew Malis, 2013-06-27,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-vccv-impl-survey-results-01.txt>

      Most pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations mandate
      the use of the Control Word (CW) to carry information essential to
      the emulation, to inhibit ECMP behavior, and to discriminate OAM from
      PW packets.  However, some encapsulations treat the Control Word as
      optional.  As a result, implementations of the CW, for encapsulations
      for which it is optional, vary by equipment manufacturer, equipment
      model and service provider network.  Similarly, Virtual Circuit
      Connectivity Verification (VCCV) supports three Control Channel (CC)
      types and multiple Connectivity Verification (CV) Types.  This
      flexibility has led to reports of interoperability issues within
      deployed networks and associated drafts to attempt to remedy the
      situation.  This survey of the PW/VCCV user community was conducted
      to determine implementation trends.  The survey and results is
      presented herein.

  "Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance using the Label Distribution
  Protocol", Luca Martini, Giles Heron, 2013-02-20,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-rfc4447bis-01.txt>

      Layer 2 services (such as Frame Relay, Asynchronus Transfer Mode, and
      Ethernet) can be "emulated" over an MPLS backbone by encapsulating
      the Layer 2 Packet Data Units (PDU) and then transmitting them over
      "pseudowires". It is also possible to use pseudowires to provide
      low-rate Time Dividion Multiplexed and Synchronous Optical NETworking
      circuit emulation over a MPLS-enabled network. This document
      specifies a protocol for establishing and maintaining the
      pseudowires, using extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol
      (LDP).  Procedures for encapsulating Layer 2 PDUs are specified in a
      set of companion documents.

  "LDP extensions for Pseudowire Binding to LSP Tunnels", Mach Chen, Wei
  Cao, Attila Takacs, Ping Pan, 2013-06-03,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-tp-pw-over-bidir-lsp-01.txt>

      Many transport services require that user traffic, in the forms of
      Pseudowires (PW), to be delivered on a single co-routed bidirectional
      LSP or two LSPs that share the same routes.  In addition, the user
      traffic may traverse through multiple transport networks.
      
      This document specifies an optional extension in LDP that enable the
      binding between PWs and the underlying LSPs.

  "Pseudowire Redundancy on S-PE", Jie Dong, Haibo Wang, 2013-06-21,
  <draft-ietf-pwe3-redundancy-spe-01.txt>

      This document describes Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) protection
      scenarios in which the pseudowire redundancy is provided on the
      Switching-PE (S-PE).  Operations of the S-PEs which provide PW
      redundancy are specified in this document.  Signaling of the
      preferential forwarding status as defined in [RFC6870] is reused.
      This document does not require any change to the T-PEs of MS-PW.

  "VCCV MPLS-TP Connectivity Verification (CV) Capability Advertisement",
  Greg Mirsky, 2013-04-08, <draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-tp-cv-adv-00.txt>

      This document specifies how use of proactive Connectivity
      Verification, Continuity Check, and Remote Defect Indication for the
      MPLS Transport Profile [RFC6428] affects operation and management
      function election for PW VCCV [RFC5085], [RFC5885].

IMAP QRESYNC Extension (qresync)
--------------------------------

  "IMAP4 Extensions for Quick Mailbox Resynchronization", Alexey Melnikov,
  Dave Cridland, 2013-07-02, <draft-ietf-qresync-rfc5162bis-02.txt>

      This document defines an IMAP4 extension, which gives an IMAP client
      the ability to quickly resynchronize any previously opened mailbox as
      part of the SELECT command, without the need for server-side state or
      additional client round-trips.  This extension also introduces a new
      response that allows for a more compact representation of a list of
      expunged messages (and always includes the Unique Identifiers (UIDs)
      expunged).

  "IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE Operation or Quick Flag Changes
  Resynchronization", Alexey Melnikov, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-ietf-qresync-rfc4551bis-02.txt>

      Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate changes to
      a common IMAP mailbox.  Examples include different clients working on
      behalf of the same user, and multiple users accessing shared
      mailboxes.  These clients need a mechanism to synchronize state
      changes for messages within the mailbox.  They must be able to
      guarantee that only one client can change message state (e.g.,
      message flags) at any time.  An example of such an application is use
      of an IMAP mailbox as a message queue with multiple dequeueing
      clients.
      
      The Conditional Store facility provides a protected update mechanism
      for message state information that can detect and resolve conflicts
      between multiple writing mail clients.
      
      The Conditional Store facility also allows a client to quickly
      resynchronize mailbox flag changes.
      
      This document defines an extension to IMAP (RFC 3501).

RADIUS EXTensions (radext)
--------------------------

  "NAI-based Dynamic Peer Discovery for RADIUS/TLS and RADIUS/DTLS",
  Stefan Winter, Mike McCauley, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-ietf-radext-dynamic-discovery-07.txt>

      This document specifies a means to find authoritative RADIUS servers
      for a given realm.  It is used in conjunction with either RADIUS/TLS
      and RADIUS/DTLS.

  "DTLS as a Transport Layer for RADIUS", Alan DeKok, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-ietf-radext-dtls-06.txt>

      The RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] has limited support for authentication
      and encryption of RADIUS packets.  The protocol transports data "in
      the clear", although some parts of the packets can have "obfuscated"
      content.  Packets may be replayed verbatim by an attacker, and
      client-server authentication is based on fixed shared secrets.  This
      document specifies how the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
      protocol may be used as a fix for these problems.  It also describes
      how implementations of this proposal can co-exist with current RADIUS
      systems.

  "RADIUS Attributes for IEEE 802 Networks", Bernard Aboba, Jouni Malinen,
  Paul Congdon, Joseph Salowey, Mark Jones, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-radext-ieee802ext-08.txt>

      RFC 3580 provides guidelines for the use of the Remote Authentication
      Dialin User Service (RADIUS) within IEEE 802 local area networks
      (LANs).  This document proposes additional attributes for use within
      IEEE 802 networks, as well as clarifications on the usage of the EAP-
      Key-Name attribute, updating RFC 4072.  The attributes defined in
      this document are usable both within RADIUS and Diameter.

  "The Network Access Identifier", Alan DeKok, 2013-05-23,
  <draft-ietf-radext-nai-03.txt>

      In order to provide inter-domain authentication services, it is
      necessary to have a standardized method that domains can use to
      identify each others users.  This document defines the syntax for the
      Network Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity submitted by the
      client prior to accessing network resources. This document is a
      revised version of RFC 4282 [RFC4282], which addresses issues with
      international character sets, as well as a number of other
      corrections to the previous document.

  "Considerations for Information Services and Operator Services Using
  SIP", John Haluska, Richard Ahern, Marty Cruze, Chris Blackwell,
  2011-08-15, <draft-haluska-sipping-directory-assistance-11.txt>

      Information Services are services whereby information is provided in
      response to user requests, and may include involvement of a human or
      automated agent. A popular existing Information Service is Directory
      Assistance (DA). Moving ahead, Information Services providers
      envision exciting multimedia services that support simultaneous
      voice and data interactions with full operator backup at any time
      during the call. Information Services providers are planning to
      migrate to SIP based platforms, which will enable such advanced
      services, while continuing to support traditional DA services.
      
      Operator Services are traditional PSTN services which often involve
      providing human or automated assistance to a caller, and often
      require the specialized capabilities traditionally provided by an
      operator services switch. Market and/or regulatory factors in some
      jurisdictions dictate that some subset of Operator Services continue
      to be provided going forward.
      
      This document aims to identify how Operator and Information Services
      can be implemented using existing or currently proposed SIP
      mechanisms, to identity existing protocol gaps, and to provide a set
      of Best Current Practices to facilitate interoperability. For
      Operator Services, the intention is to describe how current operator
      services can continue to be provided to PSTN based subscribers via a
      SIP based operator services architecture. It also looks at how
      current operator services might be provided to SIP based subscribers
      via such an architecture, but does not consider the larger question
      of the need for or usefulness or suitability of each of these
      services for SIP based subscribers.
      
      This document addresses the needs of current Operator and
      Information Services providers; as such, the intended audience
      includes vendors of equipment and services to such providers.

  "A Uniform Resource Name Namespace for the GSM Association (GSMA) and
  the International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI)", Michael
  Montemurro, Andrew Allen, David McDonald, Paul Gosden, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-montemurro-gsma-imei-urn-16.txt>

      This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name namespace for the
      GSMA (GSM Association)and a sub-namespace for the IMEI (International
      Mobile station Equipment Identity), and an associated parameter for
      the IMEISV (International Mobile station Equipment Identity and
      Software Version number).  The IMEI is 15 decimal digits long and the
      IMEISV is 16 decimal digits long and both are encoded using Binary
      Encoded Decimal (BCD).  The IMEI and IMEISV were introduced as part
      of the specification for Global System for Mobile communications(GSM)
      and are also now incorporated by the 3rd Generation Partnership
      Project (3GPP) as part of the 3GPP specification for GSM, the
      Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and 3GPP LTE (Long
      Term Evolution).  The IMEI and IMEISV are used to uniquely identify
      Mobile Equipment within these systems and are managed by the GSMA.

  "IANA Registering a SIP Resource Priority Header Field Namespace for
  Local Emergency Communications", James Polk, 2013-02-23,
  <draft-polk-local-emergency-rph-namespace-05.txt>

      This document creates the new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
      Resource Priority header field namespace 'esnet' for local emergency
      session establishment to a public safety answering point (PSAP),
      between PSAPs, and between a PSAP and first responders and their
      organizations, and places this namespace in the IANA registry.

  "Using the International Mobile station Equipment Identity(IMEI)URN as
  an Instance ID", Andrew Allen, 2013-07-05,
  <draft-allen-dispatch-imei-urn-as-instanceid-10.txt>

      This specification defines how the Uniform Resource Name namespace
      reserved for the GSMA (GSM Association) identities and its sub-
      namespace for the IMEI (International Mobile station Equipment
      Identity) can be used as an instance-id as specified in RFC 5626 [1]
      and also as used by RFC 5627 [2].  Its purpose is to fulfil the
      requirements in RFC 5626 [1] that state "If a URN scheme other than
      UUID is used, the UA MUST only use URNs for which an RFC (from the
      IETF stream) defines how the specific URN needs to be constructed and
      used in the "+sip.instance" Contact header field parameter for
      outbound behavior."

  "URI Scheme for Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) Protocol",
  Suhas Nandakumar, Gonzalo Salgueiro, Paul Jones, Marc Petit-Huguenin,
  2013-07-12, <draft-nandakumar-rtcweb-stun-uri-05.txt>

      This document is the specification of the syntax and semantics of the
      Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Session Traversal
      Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol.

  "Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) Uniform Resource Identifiers",
  Marc Petit-Huguenin, Suhas Nandakumar, Gonzalo Salgueiro, Paul Jones,
  2013-07-13, <draft-petithuguenin-behave-turn-uris-05.txt>

      This document specifies the syntax of Uniform Resource Identifier
      (URI) schemes for the Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN)
      protocol.  It defines two URI schemes to provision the TURN
      Resolution Mechanism [RFC5928].

  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Conference State",
  Emil Ivov, 2013-06-18, <draft-ivov-grouptextchat-purpose-03.txt>

      This document defines and registers a value of "grouptextchat"
      ("Group Text Chat") value for the URI <purpose> element of SIP's
      Conference Event Package [RFC4575].

  "A Session Identifier for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)",
  Hadriel Kaplan, 2013-08-02, <draft-kaplan-insipid-session-id-03.txt>

      This RFC, which contains the text of an individual Internet Draft
      that was submitted originally to the DISPATCH Working Group, is
      being published now as an Informational document to provide a
      reference for later RFCs.  The mechanism defined in this document
      has been widely deployed, and is being followed in a backward-
      compatible fashion for a new Standards Track RFC in the INSIPID
      Working Group.  The original Abstract follows.
      
      There is a need for having a globally unique session identifier for
      the same SIP session, which can be consistently maintained across
      Proxies, B2BUAs and other SIP middle-boxes, for the purpose of
      Troubleshooting.  This draft proposes a new SIP header to carry such
      a value: Session-ID.

Reputation Services (repute)
----------------------------

  "A Reputation Query Protocol", Nathaniel Borenstein, Murray Kucherawy,
  2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-repute-query-http-09.txt>

      This document defines a mechanism to conduct queries for reputation
      information over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol using JSON as the
      payload meta-format.

  "A Media Type for Reputation Interchange", Nathaniel Borenstein, Murray
  Kucherawy, 2013-07-18, <draft-ietf-repute-media-type-10.txt>

      This document defines the format of reputation response data
      ("reputons"), the media-type for packaging it, and definition of a
      registry for the names of reputation applications and response sets.

  "A Reputation Response Set for Email Identifiers", Nathaniel Borenstein,
  Murray Kucherawy, 2013-06-06,
  <draft-ietf-repute-email-identifiers-08.txt>

      This document defines a response set for describing assertions a
      reputation service provider can make about email identifers, for use
      in generating reputons.

  "A Model for Reputation Reporting", Nathaniel Borenstein, Murray
  Kucherawy, Andrew Sullivan, 2013-07-12, <draft-ietf-repute-model-07.txt>

      This document describes a general architecture for a reputation-based
      service and a model for requesting reputation-related data over the
      Internet, where "reputation" refers to predictions or expectations
      about an entity or an identifier such as a domain name.  The document
      roughly follows the recommendations of RFC4101 for describing a
      protocol model.

  "Operational Considerations Regarding Reputation Services", Murray
  Kucherawy, 2013-05-20, <draft-ietf-repute-considerations-02.txt>

      The use of reputation systems is has become a common tool in many
      applications that seek to apply collected intelligence about traffic
      sources.  Often this is done because it is common or even expected
      operator practice.  It is therefore important to be aware of a number
      of considerations for both operators and consumers of the data.  This
      document includes a collection of the best advice available regarding
      providers and consumers of reputation data, based on experience to
      date.  Much of this is based on experience with email reputation
      systems, but the concepts are generally applicable.

RTP Media Congestion Avoidance Techniques (rmcat)
-------------------------------------------------

  "Evaluating Congestion Control for Interactive Real-time Media", Varun
  Singh, Joerg Ott, 2013-07-15, <draft-singh-rmcat-cc-eval-03.txt>

      The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to transmit media in
      telephony and video conferencing applications.  This document
      describes the guidelines to evaluate new congestion control
      algorithms for interactive point-to-point real-time media.

  "Congestion Control Requirements For RMCAT", Randell Jesup, 2013-07-19,
  <draft-ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements-00.txt>

      Congestion control is needed for all data transported across the
      Internet, in order to promote fair usage and prevent congestion
      collapse.  The requirements for interactive, point-to-point real time
      multimedia, which needs by low-delay, semi-reliable data delivery,
      are different from the requirements for bulk transfer like FTP or
      bursty transfers like Web pages, and the TCP algorithms are not
      suitable for this traffic.
      
      This document attempts to describe a set of requirements that can be
      used to evaluate other congestion control mechanisms in order to
      figure out their fitness for this purpose, and in particular to
      provide a set of possible requirements for proposals coming out of
      the RMCAT Working Group.
      
      This document is derived from draft-jesup-rtp-congestion-reqs

Reliable Multicast Transport (rmt)
----------------------------------

  "Security and Reliable Multicast Transport Protocols: Discussions and
  Guidelines", Brian Adamson, Vincent Roca, Hitoshi Asaeda, 2013-05-17,
  <draft-ietf-rmt-sec-discussion-08.txt,.pdf>

      This document describes general security considerations for Reliable
      Multicast Transport (RMT) building blocks and protocols.  An emphasis
      is placed on risks that might be resolved in the scope of transport
      protocol design.  However, relevant security issues related to IP
      Multicast control-plane and other concerns not strictly within the
      scope of reliable transport protocol design are also discussed.  The
      document also begins an exploration of approaches that could be
      embraced to mitigate these risks.  The purpose of this document is to
      provide a consolidated security discussion and provide a basis for
      further discussions and potential resolution of any significant
      security issues that may exist in the current set of RMT standards.

Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks (roll)
------------------------------------------------

  "Terminology in Low power And Lossy Networks", JP Vasseur, 2013-03-12,
  <draft-ietf-roll-terminology-12.txt>

      The documents defines a terminology for discussing routing
      requirements and solutions for networks referred to as Low power and
      Lossy Networks (LLN).  An LLN is typically composed of many embedded
      devices with limited power, memory, and processing resources
      interconnected by a variety of links.  There is a wide scope of
      application areas for LLNs, including industrial monitoring, building
      automation (e.g.  Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning, lighting,
      access control, fire), connected home, healthcare, environmental
      monitoring, urban sensor networks, energy management, assets
      tracking, refrigeration.

  "Reactive Discovery of Point-to-Point Routes in Low Power and Lossy
  Networks", Mukul Goyal, Emmanuel Baccelli, Matthias Philipp, Anders
  Brandt, Jerry Martocci, 2013-03-20, <draft-ietf-roll-p2p-rpl-17.txt>

      This document specifies a point-to-point route discovery mechanism,
      complementary to the RPL core functionality.  This mechanism allows
      an IPv6 router to discover "on demand" routes to one or more IPv6
      routers in the LLN such that the discovered routes meet specified
      metrics constraints.

  "Multicast Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (MPL)", Jonathan
  Hui, Richard Kelsey, 2013-02-25, <draft-ietf-roll-trickle-mcast-04.txt>

      This document specifies the Multicast Protocol for Low power and
      Lossy Networks (MPL) that provides IPv6 multicast forwarding in
      constrained networks.  MPL avoids the need to construct or maintain
      any multicast forwarding topology, disseminating messages to all MPL
      Forwarders in an MPL Domain.  MPL uses the Trickle algorithm to
      manage message transmissions for both control and data-plane
      messages.  Different Trickle parameter configurations allow MPL to
      trade between dissemination latency and transmission efficiency.

  "A Mechanism to Measure the Routing Metrics along a Point-to-point Route
  in a Low Power and Lossy Network", Mukul Goyal, Emmanuel Baccelli,
  Anders Brandt, Jerry Martocci, 2013-04-01,
  <draft-ietf-roll-p2p-measurement-10.txt>

      This document specifies a mechanism that enables an RPL router to
      measure the aggregated values of given routing metrics along an
      existing route towards another RPL router, thereby allowing the
      router to decide if it wants to initiate the discovery of a better
      route.

      This document discusses the applicability of RPL in Advanced Metering
      Infrastructure (AMI) networks.

  "A Security Threat Analysis for Routing over Low-Power and Lossy
  Networks", Tzeta Tsao, Roger Alexander, Mischa Dohler, Vanesa Daza,
  Angel Lozano, 2013-06-26, <draft-ietf-roll-security-threats-03.txt>

      This document presents a security threat analysis for routing over
      low-power and lossy networks (LLN).  The development builds upon
      previous work on routing security and adapts the assessments to the
      issues and constraints specific to low-power and lossy networks.  A
      systematic approach is used in defining and evaluating the security
      threats.  Applicable countermeasures are application specific and are
      addressed in relevant applicability statements.  These assessments
      provide the basis of the security recommendations for incorporation
      into low-power, lossy network routing protocols.

  "ROLL Applicability Statement Template", Michael Richardson, 2013-06-27,
  <draft-ietf-roll-applicability-template-01.txt>

      This document is a template applicability statement for the Routing
      over Low-power and Lossy Networks (ROLL) WG.  This document is not
      for publication, but rather is to be used as a template.

  "RPL applicability in industrial networks", Tom Phinney, Pascal Thubert,
  Robert Assimiti, 2013-03-12,
  <draft-ietf-roll-rpl-industrial-applicability-00.txt>

      The wide deployment of wireless devices, with their low installed
      cost (compared to wired devices), will significantly improve the
      productivity and safety of industrial plants.  It will simultaneously
      increase the efficiency and safety of the plant's workers, by
      extending and making more timely the information set available about
      plant operations.  The new Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy
      Networks (RPL) defines a Distance Vector protocol that is designed
      for such networks.  The aim of this document is to analyze the
      applicability of that routing protocol in industrial LLNs formed of
      field devices.

  "Applicability Statement: The use of the RPL protocol set in Home
  Automation and Building Control", Anders Brandt, Emmanuel Baccelli,
  Robert Cragie, Peter Van der Stok, 2013-05-13,
  <draft-ietf-roll-applicability-home-building-00.txt,.pdf>

      The purpose of this document is to provide guidance in the selection
      and use of RPL protocols to implement the features required in
      building and home environments.

  "Overview: Real Time Protocols for Brower-based Applications", Harald
  Alvestrand, 2013-02-20, <draft-ietf-rtcweb-overview-06.txt>

      This document gives an overview and context of a protocol suite
      intended for use with real-time applications that can be deployed in
      browsers - "real time communication on the Web".
      
      It intends to serve as a starting and coordination point to make sure
      all the parts that are needed to achieve this goal are findable, and
      that the parts that belong in the Internet protocol suite are fully
      specified and on the right publication track.
      
      This document is a work item of the RTCWEB working group.

  "Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC): Media Transport and Use of RTP",
  Colin Perkins, Magnus Westerlund, Joerg Ott, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage-07.txt>

      The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) framework provides support
      for direct interactive rich communication using audio, video, text,
      collaboration, games, etc.  between two peers' web-browsers.  This
      memo describes the media transport aspects of the WebRTC framework.
      It specifies how the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in
      the WebRTC context, and gives requirements for which RTP features,
      profiles, and extensions need to be supported.

  "Security Considerations for WebRTC", Eric Rescorla, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-rtcweb-security-05.txt>

      The Real-Time Communications on the Web (RTCWEB) working group is
      tasked with standardizing protocols for real-time communications
      between Web browsers, generally called "WebRTC".  The major use cases
      for WebRTC technology are real-time audio and/or video calls, Web
      conferencing, and direct data transfer.  Unlike most conventional
      real-time systems (e.g., SIP-based soft phones) WebRTC communications
      are directly controlled by a Web server, which poses new security
      challenges.  For instance, a Web browser might expose a JavaScript
      API which allows a server to place a video call.  Unrestricted access
      to such an API would allow any site which a user visited to "bug" a
      user's computer, capturing any activity which passed in front of
      their camera.  This document defines the WebRTC threat model and
      analyzes the security threats of WebRTC in that model.

  "WebRTC Security Architecture", Eric Rescorla, 2013-07-15,

      The Real-Time Communications on the Web (RTCWEB) working group is
      tasked with standardizing protocols for enabling real-time
      communications within user-agents using web technologies (commonly
      called "WebRTC").  This document defines the security architecture
      for

  "Javascript Session Establishment Protocol", Justin Uberti, Cullen
  Jennings, 2013-02-27, <draft-ietf-rtcweb-jsep-03.txt>

      This document describes the mechanisms for allowing a Javascript
      application to fully control the signaling plane of a multimedia
      session via the interface specified in the W3C RTCPeerConnection API,
      and discusses how this relates to existing signaling protocols.

  "RTCWeb Data Channels", Randell Jesup, Salvatore Loreto, Michael Tuexen,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-rtcweb-data-channel-05.txt>

      The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) working group is charged to
      provide protocol support for direct interactive rich communication
      using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-browsers.  This
      document specifies the non-media data transport aspects of the WebRTC
      framework.  It provides an architectural overview of how the Stream
      Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is used in the WebRTC context as
      a generic transport service allowing Web Browser to exchange generic
      data from peer to peer.

  "WebRTC Audio Codec and Processing Requirements", Jean-Marc Valin, Cary

  Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)", Palanivelan Appanasamy,
  2011-11-17, <draft-palanivelan-bfd-v2-gr-13.txt>

      This document is a historical record of discussions about extending
      the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol to provide
      additional capabilities to handle Graceful Restart.
      
      These discussions took place in the context of the IETF's BFD working
      group, and the consensus in that group was that these extensions
      should not be made.
      
      This document presents a summary of the challenges to BFD in
      surviving a graceful restart, and outlines a potential protocol
      solution that was discussed and rejected within the BFD working
      group.  The purpose of this document is to provide a record of the
      work done so that future effort will not be wasted.  This document
      does not propose or document any extensions to BFD, and there is no
      intention that it should be implemented in its current form.

  "An Architecture for IP/LDP Fast-Reroute Using Maximally Redundant
  Trees", Alia Atlas, Robert Kebler, Gabor Envedi, Andras Csaszar, Jeff
  Tantsura, Maciek Konstantynowicz, Russ White, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture-03.txt>

      With increasing deployment of Loop-Free Alternates (LFA) [RFC5286],
      it is clear that a complete solution for IP and LDP Fast-Reroute is
      required.  This specification provides that solution.  IP/LDP Fast-
      Reroute with Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT-FRR) is a technology that
      gives link-protection and node-protection with 100% coverage in any
      network topology that is still connected after the failure.
      
      MRT removes all need to engineer for coverage.  MRT is also extremely
      computationally efficient.  For any router in the network, the MRT
      computation is less than the LFA computation for a node with three or
      more neighbors.

  "Remote LFA FRR", Stewart Bryant, Clarence Filsfils, Stefano Previdi,
  Mike Shand, So Ning, 2013-05-23, <draft-ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa-02.txt>

      This draft describes an extension to the basic IP fast re-route
      mechanism described in RFC5286 that provides additional backup
      connectivity for link failures when none can be provided by the basic
      mechanisms.

  "Advannced Multipath Use Cases and Design Considerations", So Ning,
  Andrew Malis, Dave McDysan, Lucy Yong, Curtis Villamizar, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-ietf-rtgwg-cl-use-cases-04.txt>

      This document provides a set of use cases and design considerations
      for Advanced Multipath.
      
      Advanced Multipath is a formalization of multipath techniques
      currently in use in IP and MPLS networks and a set of extensions to
      existing multipath techniques.

  "Advanced Multipath Framework in MPLS", So Ning, Dave McDysan, Eric
  Osborne, Lucy Yong, Curtis Villamizar, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-rtgwg-cl-framework-04.txt>

      This document specifies a framework for support of Advanced Multipath
      in MPLS networks.  As defined in this framework, an Advanced
      Multipath consists of a group of homogenous or non-homogenous links
      that have the same forward adjacency (FA) and can be considered as a
      single TE link or an IP link when advertised into IGP routing.

  "Multicast only Fast Re-Route", Apoorva Karan, Clarence Filsfils, Dino
  Farinacci, IJsbrand Wijnands, Bruno Decraene, Uwe Joorde, Wim
  Henderickx, 2013-06-21, <draft-ietf-rtgwg-mofrr-02.txt>

      As IPTV deployments grow in number and size, service providers are
      looking for solutions that minimize the service disruption due to
      faults in the IP network carrying the packets for these services.
      This draft describes a mechanism for minimizing packet loss in a
      network when node or link failures occur.  Multicast only Fast Re-
      Route (MoFRR) works by making simple enhancements to multicast
      routing protocols such as PIM and mLDP.

  "Operational management of Loop Free Alternates", Stephane Litkowski,
  Bruno Decraene, Clarence Filsfils, Kamran Raza, 2013-05-13,
  <draft-ietf-rtgwg-lfa-manageability-00.txt>

      Loop Free Alternates (LFA), as defined in RFC 5286 is an IP Fast
      ReRoute (IP FRR) mechanism enabling traffic protection for IP traffic
      (and MPLS LDP traffic by extension).  Following first deployment
      experiences, this document provides operational feedback on LFA,
      highlights some limitations, and proposes a set of refinements to
      address those limitations.  It also proposes required management
      specifications.
      
      This proposal is also applicable to remote LFA solution.

Sip ALerting for User Devices (salud)
-------------------------------------

  "URNs for the Alert-Info Header Field of the Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP)", Laura Liess, Roland Jesske, Alan Johnston, Dale Worley, Paul
  Kyzivat, 2013-07-11, <draft-ietf-salud-alert-info-urns-08.txt>

      The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to
      provide a reference to a specific rendering to be used by the UA when
      the user is alerted.  This is done using the Alert-Info header field.
      However, the reference (typically a URL) addresses only a specific
      network resource with specific rendering properties.  There is
      currently no support for standard identifiers for describing the
      semantics of the alerting situation or the characteristics of the
      alerting signal, without being tied to a particular rendering.  To
      overcome these limitations and support new applications, a new family
      of URNs for use in SIP Alert-Info header fields (and situations with
      similar requirements) is defined in this specification.
      
      This document normatively updates [RFC3261], the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP): It changes the usage of the SIP Alert-Info header
      field defined in the [RFC3261] by additionally allowing its use in
      all provisional responses to INVITE (except the 100 response).

Scalable Adaptive Multicast Research Group (samrg)
--------------------------------------------------

  "A Common API for Transparent Hybrid Multicast", Matthias Waehlisch,
  Thomas Schmidt, Stig Venaas, 2013-04-27,
  <draft-irtf-samrg-common-api-08.txt>

      Group communication services exist in a large variety of flavors and
      technical implementations at different protocol layers.  Multicast
      data distribution is most efficiently performed on the lowest
      available layer, but a heterogeneous deployment status of multicast
      technologies throughout the Internet requires an adaptive service
      binding at runtime.  Today, it is difficult to write an application
      that runs everywhere and at the same time makes use of the most
      efficient multicast service available in the network.  Facing
      robustness requirements, developers are frequently forced to use a
      stable, upper layer protocol provided by the application itself.
      This document describes a common multicast API that is suitable for
      transparent communication in underlay and overlay, and grants access
      to the different multicast flavors.  It proposes an abstract naming
      by multicast URIs and discusses mapping mechanisms between different
      namespaces and distribution technologies.  Additionally, this
      document describes the application of this API for building gateways
      that interconnect current multicast domains throughout the Internet.
      It reports on an implementation of the programming interface,
      including a service middleware.  This document is a product of the
      Scalable Adaptive Multicast (SAM) Research Group.

  "Application Layer Multicast Extensions to RELOAD", John Buford, Mario
  Kolberg, 2013-07-23,
  <draft-irtf-samrg-sam-baseline-protocol-06.txt,.pdf>

      We define a RELOAD Usage for Application Layer Multicast as well as a
      mapping to the RELOAD experimental message type to support ALM.  The
      ALM Usage is intended to support a variety of ALM control algorithms
      in an overlay-independent way.  Two example algorithms are defined,
      based on Scribe and P2PCast.

Source Address Validation Improvements (savi)
---------------------------------------------

  "SEND-based Source-Address Validation Implementation", Marcelo Bagnulo,
  Alberto Garcia-Martinez, 2013-04-26, <draft-ietf-savi-send-10.txt>

      This memo describes SEND SAVI, a mechanism to provide source address
      validation using the SEND protocol.  The proposed mechanism is
      intended to complement ingress filtering techniques to provide a
      finer granularity on the control of the source addresses used.

  "SAVI Solution for DHCP", Jun Bi, Jianping Wu, Guang Yao, Fred Baker,
  2013-06-28, <draft-ietf-savi-dhcp-18.txt>

      This document specifies the procedure for creating a binding between
      a DHCPv4/DHCPv6 assigned IP address and a binding anchor on a SAVI
      (Source Address Validation Improvements) device.  The bindings set up
      by this procedure can be used to filter out packets with forged
      source IP address in DHCP scenario.  This mechanism is proposed as a
      complement to ingress filtering to provide finer-grained source IP
      address validation.

  "Source Address Validation Improvement Framework", Jianping Wu, Jun Bi,
  Marcelo Bagnulo, Fred Baker, Christian Vogt, 2012-01-08,
  <draft-ietf-savi-framework-06.txt>

      Source Address Validation Improvement methods were developed to
      prevent nodes attached to the same IP link from spoofing each other's
      IP addresses, so as to complement ingress filtering with finer-
      grained, standardized IP source address validation.  This document is
      a framework document, which describes and motivates the design of the
      SAVI methods.  Particular SAVI methods are described in other
      documents.

  "SAVI for Mixed Address Assignment Methods Scenario", Jun Bi, Guang Yao,
  Joel Halpern, Eric Levy-Abegnoli, 2013-05-06,
  <draft-ietf-savi-mix-04.txt>

      This document reviews how multiple address discovery methods can
      coexist in a single SAVI device and collisions are resolved when the
      same binding entry is discovered by two or more methods.

System for Cross-domain Identity Management (scim)
--------------------------------------------------

  "System for Cross-Domain Identity Management:Protocol", Trey Drake,
  Chuck Mortimore, Morteza Ansari, Kelly Grizzle, Erik Wahlstroem,
  2013-04-15, <draft-ietf-scim-api-01.txt>

      The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
      is designed to make managing user identity in cloud based
      applications and services easier.  The specification suite seeks to
      build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing
      specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while
      applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models.
      It's intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management
      operations by providing a common user schema and extension model, as
      well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this
      schema using standard protocols.  In essence, make it fast, cheap,
      and easy to move users in to, out of, and around the cloud.

      This document provides a platform neutral schema and extension model
      for representing users and groups in JSON format.  This schema is
      intended for exchange and use with cloud service providers.
      Additional binding documents provide a standard REST API, SAML
      binding, and use cases.

Security Area (sec)
-------------------

  "Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol", Max Pritikin, Andrew Nourse, J
  Vilhuber, 2011-09-07, <draft-nourse-scep-23.txt>

      This document specifies the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol
      (SCEP), a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) communication protocol
      which leverages existing technology by using PKCS#7 and PKCS#10 over
      HTTP.  SCEP is the evolution of the enrollment protocol developed by
      VeriSign, Inc. for Cisco Systems, Inc. It now enjoys wide support in
      both client and a Certification Authority implementations.

  "AES-CCM ECC Cipher Suites for TLS", David McGrew, Daniel Bailey,
  Matthew Campagna, Robert Dugal, 2013-02-01,
  <draft-mcgrew-tls-aes-ccm-ecc-06.txt>

      This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
      in the Counter and CBC-MAC Mode (CCM) of operation within Transport
      Layer Security (TLS) to provide confidentiality and data origin
      authentication.  The AES-CCM algorithm is amenable to compact
      implementations, making it suitable for constrained environments.
      The ciphersuites defined in this document use Elliptic Curve
      Cryptography (ECC), and are advantageous in networks with limited
      bandwidth.

  "ECC Brainpool Curves for Transport Layer Security (TLS)", Johannes
  Merkle, Manfred Lochter, 2013-07-08, <draft-merkle-tls-brainpool-04.txt>

      This document specifies the use of several ECC Brainpool curves for
      authentication and key exchange in the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
      protocol.

  "PKCS 12 v1: Personal Information Exchange Syntax", Kathleen Moriarty,
  Magnus Nystrom, Sean Parkinson, Andreas Rusch, Michael Scott,
  2013-03-25, <draft-moriarty-pkcs12v1-1-01.txt>

      This standard describes a transfer syntax for personal identity
      information, including private keys, certificates, miscellaneous
      secrets, and extensions.  Machines, applications, browsers, Internet
      kiosks, and so on, that support this standard will allow a user to
      import, export, and exercise a single set of personal identity
      information.  This standard supports direct transfer of personal
      information under several privacy and integrity modes.

  "Object Identifier Registry for the Long-Term Archive and Notary
  Services (LTANS) Working Group", Russ Housley, 2013-07-28,
  <draft-housley-ltans-oids-01.txt>

      When the Long-Term Archive and Notary Services (LTANS) Working Group
      was chartered, an object identifier arc was set aside for use by that
      working group.  This document describes the object identifiers that
      were assigned, and it establishes IANA allocation policies for any
      future assignments within that arc.

Secure Inter-Domain Routing (sidr)
----------------------------------

  "Local Trust Anchor Management for the Resource Public Key
  Infrastructure", Mark Reynolds, Stephen Kent, Matt Lepinski, 2013-04-05,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-ltamgmt-08.txt>

      This document describes a facility to enable a relying party (RP) to
      manage trust anchors (TAs) in the context of the Resource Public Key
      Infrastructure (RPKI). It is common in RP software (not just in the
      RPKI) to allow an RP to import TA material in the form of self-signed
      certificates. However, this approach to incorporating TAs is
      potentially
      dangerous. (These self-signed certificates rarely
      incorporate any
      extensions that impose constraints on the scope of
      the imported public
      keys, and the RP is not able to impose such
      constraints.) The facility
      described in this document allows an RP to
      impose constraints on such
      TAs. Because this mechanism is designed to
      operate in the RPKI context,
      the most important constraints are the
      Internet Number Resources (INRs)
      expressed via RFC 3779 extensions.
      These extentions bind address spaces
      and/or autonomous system (AS)
      numbers to entities. The primary
      motivation for the facility described
      in this document is to enable an
      RP to ensure that INR information
      that it has acquired via some trusted
      channel is not overridden by the
      information acquired from the RPKI
      repository system or by the putative
      TAs that the RP imports.
      Specifically, the mechanism allows an RP to
      specify a set of overriding
      bindings between public key identifiers and
      INR data. These bindings
      take precedence over any conflicting bindings
      acquired by the putative
      TAs and the certificates downloaded from the
      RPKI repository system.
      This mechanism is designed for local use by an RP,
      but any entity that
      is accorded administrative control over a set of RPs
      may use this
      mechanism to convey its view of the RPKI to RPs within its
      jurisdiction.
      The means by which this latter use case is effected is
      outside the scope
      of this document.

  "RPKI-Based Origin Validation Operation", Randy Bush, 2013-02-20,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-origin-ops-20.txt>

      Deployment of RPKI-based BGP origin validation has many operational
      considerations.  This document attempts to collect and present those
      which are most critical.  It is expected to evolve as RPKI-based
      origin validation continues to be deployed and the dynamics are
      better understood.

  "BGPSEC Protocol Specification", Matt Lepinski, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol-07.txt>

      This document describes BGPSEC, an extension to the Border Gateway
      Protocol (BGP) that provides security for the path of autonomous
      systems through which a BGP update message passes.  BGPSEC is
      implemented via a new optional non-transitive BGP path attribute that
      carries a digital signature produced by each autonomous system that
      propagates the update message.

  "An Overview of BGPSEC", Matt Lepinski, Sean Turner, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-overview-03.txt>

      This document provides an overview of a security extension to the
      Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) referred to as BGPSEC.  BGPSEC improves
      security for BGP routing.

  "Threat Model for BGP Path Security", Stephen Kent, Andrew Chi,
  2013-03-26, <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-threats-05.txt>

      This document describes a threat model for the context in which BGP
      path security mechanisms will be developed.  It assumes the context
      established by the SIDR WG charter, as of April 19, 2011.  The
      charter established two goals for the SIDR work:
      
      o  Enabling an AS to verify the authorization of an origin AS to

  "Security Requirements for BGP Path Validation", Steven Bellovin, Randy
  Bush, David Ward, 2013-04-12, <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-reqs-07.txt>

      This document describes requirements for a BGP security protocol
      design to provide cryptographic assurance that the origin AS had the
      right to announce the prefix and to provide assurance of the AS Path
      of the announcement.

  "BGP Algorithms, Key Formats, & Signature Formats", Sean Turner,
  2013-03-26, <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-algs-04.txt>

      This document specifies the algorithms, algorithms' parameters,
      asymmetric key formats, asymmetric key size and signature format used
      in BGPSEC (Border Gateway Protocol Security).  This document updates
      the Profile for Algorithms and Key Sizes for use in the Resource
      Public Key Infrastructure (RFC 6485).

  "A Profile for BGPSEC Router Certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists,
  and Certification Requests", Mark Reynolds, Sean Turner, Stephen Kent,
  2013-04-17, <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles-05.txt>

      This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates for
      the purposes of supporting validation of Autonomous System (AS) paths
      in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), as part of an extension to that
      protocol known as BGPSEC.  BGP is a critical component for the proper
      operation of the Internet as a whole.  The BGPSEC protocol is under
      development as a component to address the requirement to provide
      security for the BGP protocol.  The goal of BGPSEC is to design a
      protocol for full AS path validation based on the use of strong
      cryptographic primitives.  The end-entity (EE) certificates specified
      by this profile are issued under Resource Public Key Infrastructure
      (RPKI) Certification Authority (CA) certificates, containing the AS
      Identifier Delegation extension, to routers within the Autonomous
      System (AS).  The certificate asserts that the router(s) holding the
      private key are authorized to send out secure route advertisements on
      behalf of the specified AS.  This document also profiles the
      Certificate Revocation List (CRL), profiles the format of
      certification requests, and specifies Relying Party certificate path
      validation procedures.  The document extends the RPKI; therefore,
      this documents updates the RPKI Resource Certificates Profile (RFC
      6487).

  "RPKI Router Implementation Report", Randy Bush, Rob Austein, Keyur
  Patel, Hannes Gredler, Matthias Waehlisch, 2013-03-11,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr-impl-03.txt>

      This document is an implementation report for the RPKI Router
      protocol as defined in [RFC6810].  The editor did not verify the
      accuracy of the information provided by respondents.  The respondents
      are experts with the implementations they reported on, and their
      responses are considered authoritative for the implementations for
      which their responses represent.  Respondents were asked to only use
      the YES answer if the feature had at least been tested in the lab.

  "Router Keying for BGPsec", Sean Turner, Keyur Patel, Randy Bush,
  2013-02-23, <draft-ietf-sidr-rtr-keying-01.txt>

      BGPsec-speaking routers must be provisioned with private keys and the
      corresponding public key must be published in the global RPKI
      (Resource Public Key Infrastructure).  This document describes two
      ways of provisioning public/private keys, router-driven and operator-
      driven.

  "Template for a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) for the Resource
  PKI (RPKI)", Karen Seo, 2013-07-29, <draft-ietf-sidr-cps-02.txt>

      This document contains a template to be used for creating a
      Certification Practice Statement (CPS) for an Organization that is
      part of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), e.g., a
      resource allocation registry or an ISP.

  "BGPSEC router key rollover as an alternative to beaconing", Roque
  Gagliano, Keyur Patel, Brian Weis, 2013-04-15,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-rollover-02.txt>

      BGPSEC will need to address the impact from regular and emergency
      rollover processes for the BGPSEC End-Entity (EE) certificates that
      will be performed by Certificate Authorities (CAs) participating at
      the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  This document
      provides general recommendations for that process and specifies how
      this process is used to control BGPSEC's window of exposure to replay
      attacks.

  "Responsible Grandparenting in the RPKI", Randy Bush, 2013-04-10,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-rpki-grandparenting-01.txt>

      There are circumstances in RPKI operation where a resource holder's
      parent may not be able to, or may not choose to, facilitate full and
      proper registration of the holder's data.  As in real life, the
      holder may form a relationship with their grandparent who is willing
      to aid the grandchild.  This document describes simple procedures for
      doing so.

  "Policy Qualifiers in RPKI Certificates", Andrew Newton, Geoff Huston,
  2013-05-09, <draft-ietf-sidr-policy-qualifiers-00.txt>

      This document updates RFC 6487 by clarifying the inclusion of policy
      qualifiers in the certificate policies extension of RPKI resource
      certificates.

  "Multiple Repository Publication Points support in the Resource Public
  Key Infrastructure (RPKI)", Roque Gagliano, Terry Manderson, Carlos
  Martinez, 2013-05-22,
  <draft-ietf-sidr-multiple-publication-points-00.txt>

      The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) depends on Relying
      Parties (RP) ability to access its Trust Anchors' certificate
      specified in the different "Trust Anchor Locator (TAL)" files and the
      Repository Objects located at the Certificate Authorities (CA)
      repositories hosted in its respective publication point.  This
      document updates [RFC6490] by allowing multiple URI associated to a
      single public key in a TAL file and introduces the concept of
      multiple repository publication point operators for every CA in the
      RPKI.  This document provides also recommendation for the RP behavior
      when analyzing signed objects that include multiple publications
      points.

  "BGPSec Considerations for AS Migration", Wesley George, Sandra Murphy,
  2013-07-10, <draft-ietf-sidr-as-migration-00.txt>

      This draft discusses considerations and methods for supporting and
      securing a common method for AS-Migration within the BGPSec protocol.

  "Multi-party Chat Using the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)", Aki
  Niemi, Miguel Garcia, Geir Sandbakken, 2013-01-13,
  <draft-ietf-simple-chat-18.txt>

      The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) defines a mechanism for
      sending instant messages within a peer-to-peer session, negotiated
      using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Session
      Description Protocol (SDP).  This document defines the necessary
      tools for establishing multi-party chat sessions, or chat rooms,
      using MSRP.

Session Initiation Protocol Core (sipcore)
------------------------------------------

  "An Extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Request
  History Information", Mary Barnes, Francois Audet, Shida Schubert, Hans
  van Elburg, Christer Holmberg, 2013-01-11,
  <draft-ietf-sipcore-rfc4244bis-11.txt>

      This document defines a standard mechanism for capturing the history
      information associated with a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
      request.  This capability enables many enhanced services by providing
      the information as to how and why a SIP request arrives at a specific
      application or user.  This document defines an optional SIP header
      field, History-Info, for capturing the history information in
      requests.  The document also defines SIP header field parameters for
      the History-Info and Contact header fields to tag the method by which
      the target of a request is determined.  In addition, this
      specification defines a value for the Privacy header field that
      directs the anonymization of values in the History-Info header field.
      This document obsoletes RFC 4244.

  "The WebSocket Protocol as a Transport for the Session Initiation
  Protocol (SIP)", Inaki Castillo, Jose Millan, Victor Pascual,
  2013-06-12, <draft-ietf-sipcore-sip-websocket-09.txt>

      The WebSocket protocol enables two-way realtime communication between
      clients and servers in web-based applications.  This document
      specifies a WebSocket sub-protocol as a reliable transport mechanism
      between SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) entities to enable usage of
      SIP in web-oriented deployments.  This document normatively updates

      a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Request is retargeted.  The use
      cases are described along with the corresponding call flow diagrams
      and messaging details.

SIP Recording (siprec)
----------------------

  "An Architecture for Media Recording using the Session Initiation
  Protocol", Andrew Hutton, Leon Portman, Rajnish Jain, Ken Rehor,
  2013-05-23, <draft-ietf-siprec-architecture-08.txt>

      Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
      environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
      these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
      compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
      is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
      recording device.  This document describes architectures for
      deploying session recording solutions in an environment which is
      based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Recording Metadata", Ram R,
  Parthasarathi Ravindran, Paul Kyzivat, 2013-05-27,
  <draft-ietf-siprec-metadata-12.txt>

      Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
      environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
      these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
      compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
      is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
      recording device.  This document describes the metadata model as
      viewed by Session Recording Server(SRS) and the Recording metadata
      format.

  "Session Recording Protocol", Leon Portman, Henry Lum, Charles Eckel,
  Alan Johnston, Andrew Hutton, 2013-05-17,
  <draft-ietf-siprec-protocol-10.txt>

      This document specifies the use of the Session Initiation Protocol
      (SIP), the Session Description Protocol (SDP), and the Real Time
      Protocol (RTP) for delivering real-time media and metadata from a
      Communication Session (CS) to a recording device.  The Session
      Recording Protocol specifies the use of SIP, SDP, and RTP to
      establish a Recording Session (RS) between the Session Recording
      Client (SRC), which is on the path of the CS, and a Session Recording
      Server (SRS) at the recording device.

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Recording Call Flows", Ram R,
  Parthasarathi Ravindran, Paul Kyzivat, 2013-07-13,
  <draft-ietf-siprec-callflows-01.txt>

      Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
      environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
      these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
      compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
      is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
      recording device.  This document lists call flows that has snapshot
      of metadata sent from SRC to SRS, the metadata format for which is
      described in [I-D.ietf-siprec-metadata] .  This is purely an
      informational document that is written to support the model defined
      in the metadata draft.

SIP Overload Control (soc)
--------------------------

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control", Vijay Gurbani,
  Volker Hilt, Henning Schulzrinne, 2013-05-23,
  <draft-ietf-soc-overload-control-13.txt>

      Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when
      SIP servers have insufficient resources to handle all SIP messages
      they receive.  Even though the SIP protocol provides a limited
      overload control mechanism through its 503 (Service Unavailable)
      response code, SIP servers are still vulnerable to overload.  This
      document defines the behaviour of SIP servers involved in overload
      control, and in addition, it specifies a loss-based overload scheme
      for SIP.

  "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Load Control Event Package",
  Charles Shen, Henning Schulzrinne, Arata Koike, 2013-07-30,
  <draft-ietf-soc-load-control-event-package-09.txt>

      We define a load control event package for the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP).  It allows SIP entities to distribute load filtering
      policies to other SIP entities in the network.  The load filtering
      policies contain rules to throttle calls based on their source or
      destination domain, telephone number prefix or for a specific user.
      The mechanism helps to prevent signaling overload and complements
      feedback-based SIP overload control efforts.

  "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Rate Control", Eric Noel, Philip
  Williams, 2013-04-08, <draft-ietf-soc-overload-rate-control-04.txt>

      The prevalent use of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] in
      Next Generation Networks necessitates that SIP networks provide
      adequate control mechanisms to maintain transaction throughput by
      preventing congestion collapse during traffic overloads. Already
      [draft-ietf-soc-overload-control-12] proposes a loss-based solution
      to remedy known vulnerabilities of the [RFC3261] SIP 503 (service
      unavailable) overload control mechanism. This document proposes a
      rate-based control solution to complement the loss-based control
      defined in [draft-ietf-soc-overload-control-12].

Softwires (softwire)
--------------------

  "Definitions of Managed Objects for 6rd", Lei Cai, Jacni Qin, Shishio
  Tsuchiya, 2013-05-16, <draft-cai-softwire-6rd-mib-05.txt>

      This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
      (MIB) for use with network management protocols.  In particular, it
      defines objects for managing 6rd devices.

  "Public IPv4 over IPv6 Access Network", Yong Cui, Jianping Wu, Peng Wu,
  Olivier Vautrin, Yiu Lee, 2013-07-28,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-public-4over6-10.txt>

      This document describes a mechanism called Public 4over6 which is
      designed to provide IPv4 Internet connectivity over an IPv6 access
      network using global IPv4 addresses.  Public 4over6 was developed in
      the IETF and is in use in some existing deployments, but is not
      recommended for new deployments.  Future deployments of similar
      scenarios should use Lightweight 4over6.  Public 4over6 follows the
      Hub and Spoke softwire model, and uses an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel to
      forward IPv4 packets over IPv6 access network.  The bi-directionality
      of the IPv4 communication is achieved by explicitly allocating global
      non-shared IPv4 addresses to end users, as well as maintaining IPv4-
      IPv6 address binding on the border relay.  Public 4over6 aims to
      provide uninterrupted IPv4 services to users, like Internet Content
      Providers, etc., while an operator makes the transition of the access
      network to an IPv6-only access network.

  "Motivations for Carrier-side Stateless IPv4 over IPv6 Migration
  Solutions", Mohamed Boucadair, Satoru Matsushima, Yiu Lee, Olaf Bonness,
  Isabel Borges, Gang Chen, 2012-11-13,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation-05.txt>

      IPv4 service continuity is one of the most pressing problems that
      must be resolved by Service Providers during the IPv6 transition
      period - especially after the exhaustion of the public IPv4 address
      space.  Current standardization effort that addresses IPv4 service
      continuity focuses on stateful mechanisms.  This document elaborates
      on the motivations for the need to undertake a companion effort to
      specify stateless IPv4 over IPv6 approaches.

  "Delivery of IPv4 Multicast Services to IPv4 Clients over an IPv6
  Multicast Network", Jacni Qin, Mohamed Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet,
  Yiu Lee, Qian Wang, 2013-04-14,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast-05.txt>

      This document specifies a solution for the delivery of IPv4 multicast
      services to IPv4 clients over an IPv6 multicast network.  The
      solution relies upon a stateless IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation scheme
      and uses the IPv6 multicast distribution tree to deliver IPv4
      multicast traffic.  The solution is particularly useful for the
      delivery of multicast service offerings to DS-Lite serviced
      customers.

  "Softwire Mesh Multicast", Mingwei Xu, Yong Cui, Jianping Wu, Shu Yang,
  Chris Metz, Greg Shepherd, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-mesh-multicast-05.txt,.pdf>

      The Internet needs to support IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  Both address
      families and their attendant protocol suites support multicast of the
      single-source and any-source varieties.  As part of the transition to
      IPv6, there will be scenarios where a backbone network running one IP
      address family internally (referred to as internal IP or I-IP) will
      provide transit services to attached client networks running another
      IP address family (referred to as external IP or E-IP).  It is
      expected that the I-IP backbone will offer unicast and multicast
      transit services to the client E-IP networks.
      
      Softwire Mesh is a solution to E-IP unicast and multicast support
      across an I-IP backbone.  This document describes the mechanisms for
      supporting Internet-style multicast across a set of E-IP and I-IP
      networks supporting softwire mesh.

  "RADIUS Attribute for MAP", Sheng Jiang, Yu Fu, Bing Liu, Peter Deacon,
  2013-04-26, <draft-jiang-softwire-map-radius-04.txt>

      Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) is a stateless mechanism for
      running IPv4 over IPv6-only infrastructure. It provides both IPv4 and
      IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-
      existing period. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
      (DHCPv6) MAP options has been defined to configure MAP Customer Edge
      (CE). However, in many networks, the configuration information may be
      stored in Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers
      while user configuration is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway
      (BNG) through DHCPv6 protocol. This document defines a Remote
      Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries
      MAP configuration information from AAA server to BNG. The MAP RADIUS
      attribute are designed following the simplify principle. It provides
      just enough information to form the correspondent DHCPv6 MAP option.

  "Definitions of Managed Objects for MAP-E", Yu Fu, Sheng Jiang, Bing
  Liu, Jiang Dong, Peng Wu, 2013-05-14, <draft-fu-softwire-map-mib-05.txt>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for using with network management protocols in the Internet
      community. In particular, it defines managed objects for MAP
      encapsulation mode.

  "DHCPv6 Option for IPv4-Embedded Multicast and Unicast IPv6 Prefixes",
  Mohamed Boucadair, Jacni Qin, Tina Tsou, Xiaohong Deng, 2013-04-14,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-multicast-prefix-option-04.txt>

      This document defines Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6
      (DHCPv6) Option for multicast transition solutions, aiming to convey
      the IPv6 prefixes to be used to build unicast and multicast
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses.

  "IPv4 Residual Deployment via IPv6 - a Stateless Solution (4rd)", Remi
  Despres, Sheng Jiang, Reinaldo Penno, Yiu Lee, Gang Chen, Maoke Chen,
  2013-07-11, <draft-ietf-softwire-4rd-06.txt>

      The 4rd automatic tunneling mechanism makes IPv4 Residual Deployment
      possible via IPv6 networks without maintaining for this per-customer
      states in 4rd-capable nodes (reverse of the IPv6 Rapid Deployment of
      6rd).  To cope with the IPv4 address shortage, customer sites can be
      assigned shared public IPv4 addresses with restricted port sets. 4rd
      can also support the scenarios that customer sites are assigned full
      public IPv4 addresses or a set of public IPv4 addresses.

  "DHCPv6 Options for configuration of Softwire Address and Port Mapped
  Clients", Tomek Mrugalski, Xiaohong Deng, Ole Troan, Congxiao Bao,
  Wojciech Dec,  leaf.yeh.sdo@gmail.com, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-map-dhcp-04.txt>

      This document specifies DHCPv6 options, termed Softwire46 options,
      for the provisioning of Softwire46 Customer Edge (CE) devices.
      Softwire46 is a collective term used to refer to architectures based
      on the notion of IPv4 Address+Port (A+P) for providing IPv4
      connectivity across an IPv6 network, as specified by the IETF
      Softwires Working Group, including those where the IPv4 A+P
      parameters are optionally derived from the CE's IPv6 network prefix
      by algorithmic means.

  "Unified IPv4-in-IPv6 Softwire CPE", Mohamed Boucadair, Ian Farrer,
  Simon Perreault, Senthil Sivakumar, 2013-05-30,
  <draft-ietf-softwire-unified-cpe-01.txt>

      Transporting IPv4 packets encapsulated in IPv6 is a common solution
      to the problem of IPv4 service continuity over IPv6-only provider
      networks.  A number of differing functional approaches have been
      developed for this, each having their own specific characteristics.
      As these approaches share a similar functional architecture and use
      the same data plane mechanisms, this memo describes a specification
      whereby a single CPE can interwork with all of the standardized and
      proposed approaches to providing encapsulated IPv4 in IPv6 services.

  "Lightweight 4over6: An Extension to the DS-Lite Architecture", Yong
  Cui, Qiong Sun, Mohamed Boucadair, Tina Tsou, Yiu Lee, Ian Farrer,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-softwire-lw4over6-01.txt>

      DS-Lite [RFC6333] describes an architecture for transporting IPv4
      packets over an IPv6 network.  This document specifies an extension
      to DS-Lite called Lightweight 4over6 which moves the Network Address
      Translation function from the DS-Lite AFTR to the B4, removing the
      requirement for a Carrier Grade NAT function in the AFTR.  This
      reduces the amount of centralized state that must be held to a per-
      subscriber level.  In order to delegate the NAPT function and make
      IPv4 Address sharing possible, port-restricted IPv4 addresses are
      allocated to the B4s.

  "Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email,
  Version 1", D. Kitterman, 2013-07-14, <draft-ietf-spfbis-4408bis-17.txt>

      Email on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways.  In
      particular, existing protocols place no restriction on what a sending
      host can use as the "MAIL FROM" of a message or the domain given on
      the SMTP HELO/EHLO commands.  This document describes version 1 of
      the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol, whereby ADministrative
      Management Domains (ADMDs) can explicitly authorize the hosts that
      are allowed to use its domain names, and a receiving host can check
      such authorization.

  "iSCSI Extensions for RDMA Specification", Mike Ko, Alexander Nezhinsky,
  2013-07-09, <draft-ietf-storm-iser-15.txt>

      iSCSI Extensions for Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) provides the
      RDMA data transfer capability to iSCSI by layering iSCSI on top of
      an RDMA-Capable Protocol.  An RDMA-Capable Protocol provides RDMA
      Read and Write services, which enable data to be transferred
      directly into SCSI I/O Buffers without intermediate data copies.
      This document describes the extensions to the iSCSI protocol to
      support RDMA services as provided by an RDMA-Capable Protocol.
      
      This document obsoletes RFC 5046.

  "Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) SCSI Features
  Update", Frederick Knight, Mallikarjun Chadalapaka, 2013-07-30,
  <draft-ietf-storm-iscsi-sam-08.txt,.pdf>

      Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) is a SCSI
      transport protocol that maps the SCSI family of protocols onto
      TCP/IP. The iSCSI protocol as specified in RFCxxx (and as
      previously specified by the combination of RFC 3720 and RFC
      5048) is based on the SAM-2 (SCSI Architecture Model - 2)
      version of the SCSI family of protocols. This document
      defines enhancements to the iSCSI protocol to support certain
      additional features of the SCSI protocol that were defined in
      SAM-3, SAM-4, and SAM-5.
      
      This document is a companion document to RFCxxx.

  <draft-ietf-storm-iscsi-cons-10.txt,.pdf>

      This document describes a transport protocol for SCSI that works
      on top of TCP. The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with
      the standardized SCSI Architecture Model (SAM-2). RFC 3720
      defined the original iSCSI protocol. RFC 3721 discusses iSCSI
      Naming examples and discovery techniques. Subsequently, RFC 3980
      added an additional naming format to iSCSI protocol. RFC 4850
      followed up by adding a new public extension key to iSCSI. RFC
      5048 offered a number of clarifications and a few improvements and
      corrections to the original iSCSI protocol.
      
      
      This document obsoletes RFCs 3720, 3980, 4850 and 5048 by
      consolidating them into a single document and making additional
      updates to the consolidated specification. This document also
      updates RFC 3721. The text in this document thus supersedes the
      text in all the noted RFCs wherever there is a difference in
      semantics.

  Peter Saint-Andre, Saul Corretge, Emil Ivov, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-stox-media-01.txt>

      This document defines a bi-directional protocol mapping for use by
      gateways that enable the exchange of media signalling messages
      between systems that implement the Jingle extensions to the
      Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) and those that
      implement the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

  "Interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
  Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Presence", Peter
  Saint-Andre, Avshalom Houri, Joe Hildebrand, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-ietf-stox-presence-00.txt>

      This document defines a bi-directional protocol mapping for the
      exchange of presence information between the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
      (XMPP).

Sip Traversal Required for Applications to Work (straw)
-------------------------------------------------------

  "A Taxonomy of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Back-to-Back User
  Agents", Hadriel Kaplan, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-straw-b2bua-taxonomy-02.txt>

      In many SIP deployments, SIP entities exist in the SIP signaling path
      between the originating UAC and final terminating UAS, which go
      beyond the definition of a Proxy, performing functions not defined in
      standards-track RFCs.  The only term for such devices provided in
      [RFC3261] is for a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), which is defined
      as the logical concatenation of a User Agent Server (UAS) and User
      Agent Client (UAC).
      
      There are numerous types of SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs),
      performing different roles in different ways.  For Example IP-PBXs,
      SBCs and Application Servers.  This document identifies several
      common B2BUA roles, in order to provide taxonomy other documents can
      use and reference.

  "Loop Detection Mechanisms for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
  Back-to- Back User Agents (B2BUAs)", Hadriel Kaplan, Victor Pascual,
  2013-04-18, <draft-ietf-straw-b2bua-loop-detection-00.txt>

      SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) can cause unending SIP request
      routing loops because, as User Agent Clients, they can generate SIP
      requests with new Max-Forwards values.  This document discusses the
      difficulties associated with loop detection for B2BUAs, and
      requirements for them to prevent infinite loops.

  "A Media-based Traceroute Function for the Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP)", Hadriel Kaplan, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-straw-sip-traceroute-00.txt>

      SIP already provides the ability to perform hop-by-hop traceroute
      for SIP messages using the Max-Forwards header field, in order to
      determine the reachability path of requests to a target.  A
      mechanism for media-loopback calls has also been defined separately,
      which enables test calls to be generated which result in media being
      looped back to the originator.  This document describes a means of
      performing hop-by-hop traceroute-style test calls using the media-
      loopback mechanism, in order to test the media path when SIP
      sessions go through media-relaying B2BUAs.

Sunsetting IPv4 (sunset4)
-------------------------

  "Gap Analysis for IPv4 Sunset", Jean-Philippe Dionne, Simon Perreault,
  Tina Tsou, Cathy Zhou, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-sunset4-gapanalysis-03.txt>

      Sunsetting IPv4 refers to the process of turning off IPv4
      definitively.  It can be seen as the final phase of the migration to
      IPv6.  This memo enumerates difficulties arising when sunsetting
      IPv4, and identifies the gaps requiring additional work.

TCP Maintenance and Minor Extensions (tcpm)
-------------------------------------------

  "TCP Extensions for High Performance", David Borman, Robert Braden, Van
  Jacobson, Richard Scheffenegger, 2013-05-23,
  <draft-ietf-tcpm-1323bis-14.txt>

      This document specifies a set of TCP extensions to improve
      performance over paths with a large bandwidth * delay product and to
      provide reliable operation over very high-speed paths.  It defines
      TCP options for scaled windows and timestamps.  The timestamps are
      used for two distinct mechanisms, RTTM (Round Trip Time Measurement)
      and PAWS (Protection Against Wrapped Sequences).
      
      This document updates and obsoletes RFC 1323.

  "Shared Use of Experimental TCP Options", Joseph Touch, 2013-06-04,
  <draft-ietf-tcpm-experimental-options-06.txt>

      This document describes how the experimental TCP option codepoints
      can concurrently support multiple TCP extensions, even within the
      same connection. It uses a new IANA TCP experiment identifier, and
      is also robust to experiments that are not registered and those that
      do not use this sharing mechanism. It is recommended for all new TCP
      options that use these codepoints.

  "TCP Fast Open", Yuchung Cheng, Jerry Chu, Arvind Jain, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-tcpm-fastopen-04.txt>

      TCP Fast Open (TFO) allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK
      packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial
      connection handshake, thus saving up to one full round trip time
      (RTT) compared to the standard TCP, which requires a three-way
      handshake (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged. However
      TFO deviates from the standard TCP semantics in that the data in the
      SYN could be replayed to an application in some rare circumstances.
      Applications should not use TFO unless they can tolerate this issue,
      which is detailed in the Applicability section.
      
      Terminology

  "Problem Statement and Requirements for a More Accurate ECN Feedback",
  Mirja Kuehlewind, Richard Scheffenegger, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-tcpm-accecn-reqs-03.txt>

      Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an IP/TCP mechanism where
      network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to
      indicate congestion to the end-points.  An ECN-capable receiver will
      feedback this information to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP in
      such a way that only one feedback signal can be transmitted per
      Round-Trip Time (RTT).  Recently, new TCP mechanisms like ConEx or
      DCTCP need more accurate ECN feedback information in the case where
      more than one marking is received in one RTT.  This documents
      specifies requirement for different ECN feedback scheme in the TCP
      header to provide more than one feedback signal per RTT.

  "Updating TCP to support Rate-Limited Traffic", Gorry Fairhurst, Arjuna
  Sathiaseelan, Raffaello Secchi, 2013-07-01,
  <draft-ietf-tcpm-newcwv-02.txt>

      This document proposes an update to RFC 5681 to address issues that
      arise when TCP is used to support traffic that exhibits periods where
      the sending rate is limited by the application rather than the
      congestion window.  It updates TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart
      quickly following either an idle or rate-limited interval.  This
      method is expected to benefit applications that send rate-limited
      traffic using TCP, while also providing an appropriate response if
      congestion is experienced.
      
      It also evaluates the Experimental specification of TCP Congestion
      Window Validation, CWV, defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that RFC
      2861 sought to address important issues, but failed to deliver a
      widely used solution.  This document therefore recommends that the
      status of RFC 2861 is moved from Experimental to Historic, and that
      it is replaced by the current specification.
      
      NOTE: The standards status of this WG document is under review for
      consideration as either Experimental (EXP) or Proposed Standard (PS).
      This decision will be made later as the document is finalised.

  "TCP and SCTP RTO Restart", Per Hurtig, Anna Brunstrom, Andreas Petlund,
  Michael Welzl, 2013-02-18, <draft-ietf-tcpm-rtorestart-00.txt>

      This document describes a modified algorithm for managing the TCP and
      SCTP retransmission timers that provides faster loss recovery when a
      connection's amount of outstanding data is small.  The modification
      allows the transport to restart its retransmission timer more
      aggressively in situations where fast retransmit cannot be used.
      This enables faster loss detection and recovery for connections that
      are short-lived or application-limited.

Timing over IP Connection and Transfer of Clock (tictoc)
--------------------------------------------------------

  "Transporting Timing messages over MPLS Networks", Shahram Davari, Amit
  Oren, Manav Bhatia, Peter Roberts, Laurent Montini, 2013-06-14,
  <draft-ietf-tictoc-1588overmpls-05.txt>

      This document defines the method for transporting Timing messages
      such as PTP and NTP over an MPLS network.  The method allows for the
      easy identification of these PDUs at the port level to allow for port
      level processing of these PDUs in both LERs and LSRs.
      
      The basic idea is to transport Timing messages inside dedicated MPLS
      LSPs.  These LSPs only carry Timing messages and possibly Control and
      Management packets, but they do not carry customer traffic.
      
      Two methods for transporting Timing messages over MPLS are defined.
      The first method is to transport Timing messages directly over the
      dedicated MPLS LSP via UDP/IP encapsulation, which is suitable for
      MPLS networks.  The second method is to transport Timing messages
      inside a PW via Ethernet encapsulation.

  "Precision Time Protocol Version 2 (PTPv2) Management Information Base",
  Vinay Shankarkumar, Laurent Montini, Tim Frost, Greg Dowd, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-tictoc-ptp-mib-05.txt,.pdf>

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
      In particular, it defines objects for managing networks using
      Precision Time Protocol, specified in [IEEE 1588-2008].
      
      This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant
      to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
      definitions.

  "Security Requirements of Time Protocols in Packet Switched Networks",
  Tal Mizrahi, 2013-04-25,
  <draft-ietf-tictoc-security-requirements-05.txt>

      As time and frequency distribution protocols are becoming
      increasingly common and widely deployed, concern about their exposure
      to various security threats is increasing. This document defines a
      set of security requirements for time protocols, focusing on the
      Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
      This document also discusses the security impacts of time protocol
      practices, the performance implications of external security
      practices on time protocols and the dependencies between other
      security services and time synchronization.

  "Enterprise Profile for the Precision Time Protocol With Mixed Multicast
  and Unicast Messages", Doug Arnold, Heiko Gerstung, 2013-07-07,
  <draft-ietf-tictoc-ptp-enterprise-profile-00.txt>

      This document describes a profile for the use of the Precision
      Time Protocol in an IPV4 or IPv6 Enterprise information system
      environment.  The profile uses the End to End Delay Measurement
      Mechanism, allows both multicast and unicast Delay Request and Delay
      Response Messages.

Transport Layer Security (tls)
------------------------------

  "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Cached Information Extension", Stefan
  Santesson, Hannes Tschofenig, 2013-03-28,
  <draft-ietf-tls-cached-info-14.txt>

      Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshakes often include fairly static
      information, such as the server certificate and a list of trusted
      Certification Authorities (CAs).  This information can be of
      considerable size, particularly if the server certificate is bundled
      with a complete certificate path (including all intermediary
      certificates up to the trust anchor public key).
      
      This document defines an extension that omits the exchange of already
      available information.  The TLS client informs a server of cached
      information, for example from a previous TLS handshake, allowing the
      server to omit the already available information.

  "Out-of-Band Public Key Validation for Transport Layer Security (TLS)",
  Paul Wouters, Hannes Tschofenig, John Gilmore, Samuel Weiler, Tero
  Kivinen, 2013-07-30, <draft-ietf-tls-oob-pubkey-09.txt>

      This document specifies a new certificate type and two TLS
      extensions, one for the client and one for the server, for exchanging
      raw public keys in Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram
      Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for use with out-of-band public key
      validation.

  "Secure Password Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)", Dan
  Harkins, Dave Halasz, 2013-02-15, <draft-ietf-tls-pwd-00.txt>

      This memo defines several new ciphersuites for the Transport Layer
      Security (TLS) protocol to support certificate-less, secure
      authentication using only a simple, low-entropy, password.  The
      ciphersuites are all based on an authentication and key exchange
      protocol that is resistant to off-line dictionary attack.

  "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Application Layer Protocol Negotiation
  Extension", Stephan Friedl, Andrey Popov, Adam Langley, Stephan Emile,
  2013-04-25, <draft-ietf-tls-applayerprotoneg-01.txt>

      This document describes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension
      for application layer protocol negotiation within the TLS handshake.
      For instances in which the TLS connection is established over a well
      known TCP/IP port not associated with the desired application layer
      protocol, this extension allows the application layer to negotiate
      which protocol will be used within the TLS session.

Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (trill)
----------------------------------------------------

  "TRILL: Campus Label and Priority Regions", Radia Perlman, Anil
  Rijhsinghani, Donald Eastlake, Ayan Banerjee, Dinesh Dutt, 2013-07-04,
  <draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-vlan-mapping-09.txt>

      Within a TRILL campus, the data label (VLAN or Fine Grained Label)
      and priority of TRILL encapsulated frames is preserved. However, in
      some cases it may be desired that data label and/or priority be
      mapped at the boundary between regions of such a campus. This
      document describes an optional TRILL switch feature to provide this
      function.

  "TRILL: RBridge Channel Support", Donald Eastlake, Vishwas Manral, Li
  Yizhou, Sam Aldrin, David Ward, 2012-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-channel-08.txt>

      This document specifies a general channel mechanism for sending
      messages, such as BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) messages,
      between RBridges (Routing Bridges) and between RBridges and end
      stations in an RBridge campus through extensions to the TRILL
      (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol.

  "TRILL (Transparent Interconnetion of Lots of Links): Bidirectional
  Forwarding Detection (BFD) Support", Vishwas Manral, Donald Eastlake,
  David Ward, Ayan Banerjee, 2012-07-16,
  <draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-bfd-07.txt>

      This document specifies use of the BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding
      Detection) protocol in RBridge campuses based on the Rbridge Channel
      extension to the the TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of
      Links) protocol.
      
      BFD is a widely deployed OAM (Operations, Administration, and
      Maintenance) mechanism in IP and MPLS (Multi Protocol Label
      Switching) networks, using UDP and ACH (Associated Channel Header)
      encapsulation respectively.  This document specifies the BFD
      encapsulation over TRILL.

  "TRILL: Header Extension", Donald Eastlake, Anoop Ghanwani, Vishwas
  Manral, Li Yizhou, Caitlin Bestler, 2012-06-20,
  <draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-extension-05.txt>

      The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) base
      protocol specifies minimal hooks to safely support TRILL Header
      extensions. This document specifies an initial extension providing
      additional flag bits and specifies some of those bits. It updates RFC
      6325.

  "TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links): Fine-Grained
  Labeling", Donald Eastlake, Mingui Zhang, Puneet Agarwal, Radia Perlman,
  Dinesh Dutt, 2013-05-17, <draft-ietf-trill-fine-labeling-07.txt>

      The IETF has standardized TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots
      of Links), a protocol for least cost transparent frame routing in
      multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and link technologies,
      using link-state routing and a hop count. The TRILL base protocol
      standard supports labeling of TRILL data with up to 4K IDs. However,
      there are applications that require a larger number of labels
      providing configurable isolation of data. This document updates RFC
      6325 by specifying optional extensions to the TRILL base protocol to
      safely accomplish this. These extensions, called fine grained
      labeling, are primarily intended for use in large Data Centers, those
      with >4K users requiring configurable data isolation from each other.

  "TRILL: Clarifications, Corrections, and Updates", Donald Eastlake,
  Mingui Zhang, Anoop Ghanwani, Vishwas Manral, Ayan Banerjee, 2012-07-30,
  <draft-ietf-trill-clear-correct-06.txt>

      The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
      protocol provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without
      configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology and link
      technology, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops,
      and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic.
      TRILL accomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate System to
      Intermediate System) link state routing and by encapsulating traffic
      using a header that includes a hop count. Since the TRILL base
      protocol was approved in March 2010, active development of TRILL has
      revealed errata in the original RFC 6325 and some cases that could
      use clarifications or updates.
      
      RFC 6327 and RFC 6439 provide clarifications and updates with respect
      to Adjacency and Appointed Forwarders. This document provides other
      known clarifications, corrections, and updates to RFC 6325, RFC 6327,
      and RFC 6439.

  "TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links): ESADI (End
  Station Address Distribution Information) Protocol", ZTE Corporation,
  fangwei hu, Radia Perlman, Donald Eastlake, Olen Stokes, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-trill-esadi-03.txt>

      The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
      protocol provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without
      configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and
      link technologies.  TRILL supports multi-pathing of both unicast and
      multicast traffic.  Devices that implement the TRILL protocol are
      called TRILL Switches or RBridges (Routing Bridges).
      
      ESADI (End Station Address Distribution Information) is an optional
      protocol by which a TRILL switch can communicate, in a Data Label
      (VLAN or Fine Grained Label) scoped way, end station addresses and
      other information to TRILL switches participating in ESADI for the
      relevant Data Label.  This document updates RFC 6325, specifically
      the documentation of the ESADI protocol.

  "TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links): Edge Directory
  Assistance Framework", Linda Dunbar, Donald Eastlake, Radia Perlman,
  Igor Gashinsky, 2013-07-29,
  <draft-ietf-trill-directory-framework-06.txt>

      Edge TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) switches
      currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses and their egress
      TRILL switch by observing the data packets they ingress or egress or
      by the TRILL ESADI (End Station Address Distribution Information)
      protocol. When an ingress TRILL switch receives a data frame whose
      destination address (MAC&Label) that switch does not know, the data
      frame is flooded within the frame's Data Label across the TRILL
      campus.
      
      This document describes the framework for using directory services to
      assist edge TRILL switches in reducing multi-destination frames,
      particularly unknown unicast frames flooding, and ARP/ND, thus
      improving TRILL network scalability and security.

  "TRILL OAM Framework", Samer Salam, Tissa Senevirathne, Sam Aldrin,
  Donald Eastlake, 2013-05-23, <draft-ietf-trill-oam-framework-02.txt>

      This document specifies a reference framework for Operations,
      Administration and Maintenance (OAM) in TRILL networks. The focus of
      the document is on the fault and performance management aspects of
      TRILL OAM.

  "TRILL: Adjacency", Donald Eastlake, Radia Perlman, Anoop Ghanwani,
  Howard Yang, Vishwas Manral, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-trill-rfc6327bis-01.txt>

      The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
      protocol supports arbitrary link technologies between TRILL switches
      including point-to-point links and multi-access LAN (Local Area
      Network) links that can have multiple TRILL switches and end stations
      attached. TRILL uses IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate
      System) routing. This document specifies the establishment,
      reporting, and termination of IS-IS adjacency between TRILL switches,
      also known as RBridges. It also concerns four other link-local
      aspects of TRILL: Designated RBridge (DRB) selection, MTU (Maximum
      Transmission Unit) testing, pseudonode creation, and BFD (Bi-
      Directional Forwarding Detection) session bootstrapping in connection
      with adjacency. State diagrams are included where appropriate.  This
      document obsoletes RFC 6327 and updates RFC 6325.

  "TRILL Fault Management", Tissa Senevirathne, Norman Finn, Samer Salam,
  Deepak Kumar, Donald Eastlake, Sam Aldrin, Li Yizhou, 2013-07-11,
  <draft-ietf-trill-oam-fm-00.txt>

      This document specifies TRILL OAM Fault Management. Methods in
      this document follow the IEEE 802.1 CFM framework and reuse OAM
      tools where possible. Additional messages and TLVs are defined
      for TRILL specific applications or where a different set of
      information is required other than IEEE 802.1 CFM.

  "TWAMP Burst Rate Measurement Features", Al Morton, Len Ciavattone,
  2013-02-21, <draft-morton-ippm-twamp-rate-03.txt>

      This memo describes two rate-measurement features for the core
      specification of TWAMP - the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol: an
      optional capability where the reflector host responds with a
      controlled burst of test-session packets (instead of a single
      packet), and an optional test mode that requires the responder to
      measure a burst of test packets and communicate the results in
      truncated packet(s).  Both features add the ability to control packet
      size in the tested direction, enabling asymmetrical packet size
      testing.  This draft defines the modes in terms of traditional UDP
      test packets.  Use TCP transport instead of UDP may be desirable, but
      is deferred for future work.

  "New Performance Metrics Composition Framework for Multiparty Services",
  Tiziano Ionta, 2013-06-04,
  <draft-ionta-new-multiparty-metrics-framework-02.txt>

      One of the best chances for a Service Provider to face the complex
      growth of IP Services, and their challenging requirements/SLAs along
      the Core network, is to enrich the current Performance metrics - mainly
      derived from a "Network-Oriented point of view", and therefore a
      general perspective, not focused on specific services - with some more
      Performance factors, so to include a "Service-Oriented point of view",
      more centred on the particular kind of service, with its own
      characteristics in terms of protocol, application, manageability, and
      so on.
      Almost nothing about this new approach has been standardized yet for
      the core network.
      To achieve the above goal, and starting from the one-to-group
      performance metrics outlined in RFC 5644 [RFC5644], a new metrics
      composition/aggregation framework is proposed in this memo, where the
      main focus is on multiparty communications (e.g. video providers,
      online biding, online stock market, etc.).
      Finally this memo is tuned to RFC 6390 [RFC6390] in terms of scopes,
      framework concepts, and need to widen the current performance metrics
      depending on the application, service etc.

  "TCP option for transparent Middlebox negotiation", Andrew Knutsen,
  Anantha Ramaiah, Arivu Ramasamy, 2013-02-01,
  <draft-ananth-middisc-tcpopt-02.txt>

      This document describes a TCP option for use by middleboxes to
      facilitate transparent detection of other middleboxes along the path
      of the TCP connection during the connection initiation phase.  The
      option has no effect if an appropriate middlebox is not present on
      the path.

  "CDNI Request Routing with ALTO", Jan Seedorf, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-seedorf-cdni-request-routing-alto-04.txt>

      Network Service Providers (NSPs) are currently considering to deploy
      Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) within their networks.  As a
      consequence of this development, there is a need for interconnecting
      these local CDNs.  The necessary interfaces for inter-connecting CDNs
      are currently being defined in the Content Delivery Networks
      Interconnection (CDNI) WG.  This document focuses on the CDNI
      Footprint & Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI).
      Specifically, this document outlines how the solutions currently
      being defined in the Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) WG
      can facilitate Footprint & Capabilities Advertisement in a CDNI
      context, i.e. how the CDNI FCI can be realised with the ALTO
      protocol.  Concrete examples of how ALTO can be integrated within
      CDNI request routing and in particular in the process of selecting a
      downstream CDN are given.  The examples in this document are based on
      the use cases and examples currently being discussed in the CDNI WG.

  "Spatial Aggregation Metrics for Multipary Services", Tiziano Ionta,
  2013-06-04, <draft-ionta-spatial-metrics-multiparty-services-02.txt>

      One of the best chances for a Service Provider to face the complex
      growth of IP Services, and their challenging requirements/SLAs along
      the Core network, is to enrich the current Performance metrics - mainly
      derived from a Network-oriented point of view, and therefore a general
      perspective, not focused on specific services - with some more
      Performance factors, so to include a Service-oriented point of view,
      more centred on the particular kind of service, with its own
      characteristics in terms of protocol, application, manageability,
      and so on.
      To achieve the above goal, and starting from the one-to-group
      performance metrics outlined in RFC 5644 [RFC5644], an effort to a
      deeper analysis and definition of spatial aggregation metrics (as a
      part of the framework for metric composition defined in RFC 5835
      [RFC5835])is proposed in this memo, where the main focus is on
      multiparty communications (e.g. video providers, online biding,
      online stock market, etc.).
      This memo lends itself to passive measurement as well as active
      measurement.
      Finally this memo is tuned to RFC 6390 [RFC6390] in terms of scopes,
      framework concepts, and need to widen the current performance metrics
      depending on the application, service etc.

  "Controlled Delay Active Queue Management", Kathleen Nichols, Van
  Jacobson, 2013-02-25, <draft-nichols-tsvwg-codel-01.txt,.pdf>

      The "persistently full buffer" problem has been discussed in the
      IETF community since the early 80's [RFC896]. The IRTF's End-to-End
      Working Group called for the deployment of active queue management
      to solve the problem in 1998 [RFC2309]. Despite the awareness and
      recommendations, the "full buffer" problem has not gone away, but on
      the contrary has become worse as buffers have grown in size and
      proliferated and today's networks proved intractable for available
      AQM approaches. The overall problem is presently known as
      "bufferbloat"[TSVBB2011, BB2011] and has become increasingly
      important, particularly at the consumer edge.
      This document describes a recently developed AQM, Controlled Delay
      (CoDel) algorithm, which was designed to work in modern networking
      environments and can be deployed as a major part of the solution to
      bufferbloat [CODEL2012]. The goal of the CoDel work is to provide a
      solution with cost-effective implementation that is particularly
      well-suited to the consumer edge.

  "DiffServ interconnection classes and practice", Ruediger Geib,
  2013-06-24, <draft-geib-tsvwg-diffserv-intercon-03.txt,.pdf>

      This document proposes a limited set of interconnection QoS PHBs and
      PHB groups.  It further introduces some DiffServ deployment aspects.
      The proposals made here should be integrated into a revised version
      of RFC5127.

  "Adobe's Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol", Michael Thornburgh,
  2013-07-10, <draft-thornburgh-adobe-rtmfp-10.txt>

      This memo describes Adobe's Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol
      (RTMFP), an endpoint-to-endpoint communication protocol designed to
      securely transport parallel flows of real-time video, audio, and data
      messages, as well as bulk data, over IP networks.  RTMFP has features
      making it effective for peer-to-peer (P2P) as well as client-server
      communications, even when Network Address Translators (NATs) are
      used.

Transport Area Working Group (tsvwg)
------------------------------------

  "Byte and Packet Congestion Notification", Bob Briscoe, Jukka Manner,
  2013-08-01, <draft-ietf-tsvwg-byte-pkt-congest-11.txt>

      This document provides recommendations of best current practice for
      dropping or marking packets using any active queue management (AQM)
      algorithm, including random early detection (RED), BLUE, pre-
      congestion notification (PCN) and newer schemes such as CoDel and
      PIE.  We give three strong recommendations: (1) packet size should be
      taken into account when transports detect and respond to congestion
      indications, (2) packet size should not be taken into account when
      network equipment creates congestion signals (marking, dropping), and
      therefore (3) in the specific case of RED, the byte-mode packet drop
      variant that drops fewer small packets should not be used.  This memo
      updates RFC 2309 to deprecate deliberate preferential treatment of
      small packets in AQM algorithms.

  "Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Network Address Translation
  Support", Randall Stewart, Michael Tuexen, Irene Ruengeler, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-natsupp-05.txt>

      Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable
      communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to
      TCP [RFC0793].  With the widespread deployment of Network Address
      Translators (NAT), specialized code has been added to NAT for TCP
      that allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT and yet use only a
      single globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts (behind a
      NAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection.  This
      additional code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port
      Translation (NAPT).  To date, specialized code for SCTP has not yet
      been added to most NATs so that only pure NAT is available.  The end
      result of this is that only one SCTP capable host can be behind a
      NAT.
      
      This document describes the protocol extensions required for the SCTP
      endpoints to help NATs provide similar features of NAPT in the
      single-point and multi-point traversal scenario.

  "Integrated Services (IntServ) Extension to Allow Signaling of Multiple
  Traffic Specifications and Multiple Flow Specifications in RSVPv1",
  James Polk, Subha Dhesikan, 2013-02-25,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-intserv-multiple-tspec-02.txt>

      This document defines extensions to Integrated Services (IntServ)
      allowing  multiple traffic specifications and multiple flow
      specifications to be conveyed in the same Resource Reservation
      Protocol (RSVPv1) reservation message exchange. This ability helps
      optimize an agreeable bandwidth through a network between endpoints
      in a single round trip.

  "Generic Aggregation of Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) for IPv4
  And IPv6 Reservations over PCN domains", Georgios Karagiannis, Anurag
  Bhargava, 2013-07-29, <draft-ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-pcn-06.txt>

      This document specifies extensions to Generic Aggregated RSVP
      [RFC4860] for support of the PCN Controlled Load (CL) and Single
      Marking (SM) edge behaviors over a Diffserv cloud using Pre-
      Congestion Notification.

  "Recommendations for Transport Port Uses", Joseph Touch, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-port-use-02.txt>

      This document provides recommendations to application and service
      designers on how to use the transport protocol port number space to
      help in its preservation.

  "Quick Failover Algorithm in SCTP", Yoshifumi Nishida, Preethi
  Natarajan, Armando Caro, Paul Amer, 2013-06-18,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-failover-01.txt>

      One of the major advantages in SCTP is supporting multi-homing
      communication.  If a multi-homed end-point has redundant network
      connections, SCTP sessions can have a good chance to survive from
      network failures by migrating inactive network to active one.
      However, if we follow the SCTP standard, there can be significant
      delay for the network migration.  During this migration period, SCTP
      cannot transmit much data to the destination.  This issue drastically
      impairs the usability of SCTP in some situations.  This memo
      describes the issue of SCTP failover mechanism and discuss its
      solutions which require minimal modification to the current standard.

  "DTLS Encapsulation of SCTP Packets", Randell Jesup, Salvatore Loreto,
  Randall Stewart, Michael Tuexen, 2013-07-15,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps-01.txt>

      The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport
      protocol originally defined to run on top of the network protocols
      IPv4 or IPv6.  This document specifies how SCTP can be used on top of
      the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol.

  "SACK-IMMEDIATELY Extension for the Stream Control Transmission
  Protocol", Michael Tuexen, Irene Ruengeler, Randall Stewart, 2013-04-08,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-sack-immediately-03.txt>

      This document updates RFC 4960 by defining a method for the sender of
      a DATA chunk to indicate that the corresponding SACK chunk should be
      sent back immediately and not be delayed.  It is done by specifying a
      bit in the DATA chunk header, called the I-bit, which can get set
      either by the SCTP implementation or by the application using an SCTP
      stack.  Since unknown flags in chunk headers are ignored by SCTP
      implementations, this extension does not introduce any
      interoperability problems.

  "Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Application-ID Profiles for Voice
  and Video Streams", James Polk, Subha Dhesikan, 2013-02-19,
  <draft-ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-app-id-vv-profiles-00.txt>

      RFC 2872 defines an Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) object for
      application identifiers.  This document uses that App-ID and gives
      implementers specific guidelines for differing voice and video
      stream identifications to nodes along a reservation path, creating
      specific profiles for voice and video session identification.

Uniform Resource Names, Revised (urnbis)
----------------------------------------

  "Uniform Resource Name (URN) Syntax", Peter Saint-Andre, 2013-08-02,
  <draft-ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn-06.txt>

      A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
      that is intended to serve as a persistent, location-independent
      resource identifier.  This document defines the canonical syntax for
      URIs under the "urn" scheme, guidelines for URN namespaces,
      requirements for URN presentation and transmission, and methods for
      determining URN equivalence.  This document obsoletes RFC 2141.

  "Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace Definition Mechanisms", Peter
  Saint-Andre, Leslie Daigle, Dirk-Willem van Gulik, Renato Iannella,
  Patrick Faltstrom, 2013-07-12,
  <draft-ietf-urnbis-rfc3406bis-urn-ns-reg-06.txt>

      This document supplements the Uniform Resource Name (URN) syntax
      specification by defining the concept of a URN namespace, as well as
      mechanisms for defining and registering such namespaces.  This
      document obsoletes RFC 3406.

IPv6 Operations (v6ops)
-----------------------

  "IPv6 Multihoming without Network Address Translation", Ole Troan, David
  Miles, Satoru Matsushima, Tadahisa Okimoto, Dan Wing, 2013-03-18,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv6-multihoming-without-ipv6nat-05.txt>

      Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) works well for conserving
      global addresses and addressing multihoming requirements, because an
      IPv4 NAPT router implements three functions: source address
      selection, next-hop resolution and optionally DNS resolution.  For
      IPv6 hosts one approach could be the use of NPTv6.  However, NAT
      should be avoided, if at all possible, to permit transparent end-to-
      end connectivity.  In this document, we analyze the use cases of
      multihoming.  We also describe functional requirements and possible
      solutions for multihoming without the use of NAT in IPv6 for hosts
      and small IPv6 networks that would otherwise be unable to meet
      minimum IPv6 allocation criteria.  We conclude that DHCPv6 based
      solutions are suitable to solve the multihoming issues, described in
      this document, while NPTv6 may be required as an intermediate
      solution.

  "Basic Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers", Hemant Singh, Wes
  Beebee, Chris Donley, Barbara Stark, 2012-10-30,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-6204bis-12.txt>

      This document specifies requirements for an IPv6 Customer Edge (CE)
      router.  Specifically, the current version of this document focuses
      on the basic provisioning of an IPv6 CE router and the provisioning
      of IPv6 hosts attached to it.  The document also covers IP transition
      technologies.  Two transition technologies in RFC 5969's 6rd and RFC
      6333's DS-Lite are covered in the document.  The document obsoletes
      RFC 6204, if approved.

  "Implementation Advice for IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard)",
  Fernando Gont, 2012-11-14,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-ra-guard-implementation-07.txt>

      The IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) mechanism is commonly
      employed to mitigate attack vectors based on forged ICMPv6 Router
      Advertisement messages.  Many existing IPv6 deployments rely on RA-
      Guard as the first line of defense against the aforementioned attack
      vectors.  However, some implementations of RA-Guard have been found
      to be prone to circumvention by employing IPv6 Extension Headers.
      This document describes the evasion techniques that affect the
      aforementioned implementations, and formally updates RFC 6105, such
      that the aforementioned RA-Guard evasion vectors are eliminated.

  "Enterprise IPv6 Deployment Guidelines", KK Chittimaneni, Tim Chown, Lee
  Howard, Victor Kuarsingh, Yanick Pouffary, Eric Vyncke, 2013-07-14,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-enterprise-incremental-ipv6-03.txt>

      Enterprise network administrators worldwide are in various stages of
      preparing for or deploying IPv6 into their networks.  The
      administrators face different challenges than operators of Internet
      access providers, and have reasons for different priorities.  The
      overall problem for many administrators will be to offer Internet-
      facing services over IPv6, while continuing to support IPv4, and
      while introducing IPv6 access within the enterprise IT network.  The
      overall transition will take most networks from an IPv4-only
      environment to a dual stack network environment and potentially an
      IPv6-only operating mode.  This document helps provide a framework
      for enterprise network architects or administrators who may be faced
      with many of these challenges as they consider their IPv6 support
      strategies.

  "NAT64 Operational Experiences", Gang Chen, Zhen Cao, Chongfeng Xie,
  David Binet, 2013-07-08, <draft-ietf-v6ops-nat64-experience-02.txt>

      This document summarizes NAT64 function deployment scenarios and
      operational experience.  Both NAT64-CGN (NAT64 Carrier Grade NATs)
      and NAT64-FE (NAT64 server Front End) are considered in this
      document.

  "IPv6 for 3GPP Cellular Hosts", Jouni Korhonen, Jari Arkko, Teemu
  Savolainen, Suresh Krishnan, 2013-05-26,
  <draft-ietf-v6ops-rfc3316bis-03.txt>

      As the deployment of third and fourth generation cellular networks
      progresses, a large number of cellular hosts are being connected to
      the Internet.  Standardization organizations have made Internet
      Protocol version 6 (IPv6) mandatory in their specifications.
      However, the concept of IPv6 covers many aspects and numerous
      specifications.  In addition, the characteristics of cellular links
      in terms of bandwidth, cost and delay put special requirements on how
      IPv6 is used.  This document considers IPv6 for cellular hosts that
      attach to the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Universal Mobile
      Telecommunications System (UMTS), or Evolved Packet System (EPS)
      networks (Hereafter collectively referred to as 3GPP networks).  This
      document also lists out specific IPv6 functionalities that need to be
      implemented in addition what is already prescribed in the IPv6 Node
      Requirements document.  It also discusses some issues related to the
      use of these components when operating in these networks.  This
      document obsoletes RFC 3316.

      This document presents advice on the design choices that arise when
      designing IPv6 networks (both dual-stack and IPv6-only).  The
      intended audience is someone designing an IPv6 network who is
      knowledgeable about best current practices around IPv4 network
      design, and wishes to learn the corresponding practices for IPv6.

  "Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Profile for 3GPP Mobile Devices",
  David Binet, Mohamed Boucadair, Vizdal Ales, Cameron Byrne, Gang Chen,
  2013-06-11, <draft-ietf-v6ops-mobile-device-profile-04.txt>

      This document specifies an IPv6 profile for 3GPP mobile devices.  It
      lists the set of features a 3GPP mobile device is to be compliant
      with to connect to an IPv6-only or dual-stack wireless network
      (including 3GPP cellular network and IEEE 802.11 network).
      
      This document defines a different profile than the one for general
      connection to IPv6 cellular networks defined in
      [I-D.ietf-v6ops-rfc3316bis].  In particular, this document identifies
      also features to deliver IPv4 connectivity service over an IPv6-only
      transport.
      
      Both hosts and devices with capability to share their WAN (Wide Area
      Network) connectivity are in scope.

      usage scenarios and recommends use cases where ULA address may be
      beneficially used.

Web Security (websec)
---------------------

  "Public Key Pinning Extension for HTTP", Chris Evans, Chris Palmer, Ryan
  Sleevi, 2013-07-11, <draft-ietf-websec-key-pinning-08.txt>

      This memo describes an extension to the HTTP protocol allowing web
      host operators to instruct user agents (UAs) to remember ("pin") the
      hosts' cryptographic identities for a given period of time.  During
      that time, UAs will require that the host present a certificate chain
      including at least one Subject Public Key Info structure whose
      fingerprint matches one of the pinned fingerprints for that host.  By
      effectively reducing the number of authorities who can authenticate
      the domain during the lifetime of the pin, pinning may reduce the
      incidence of man-in-the-middle attacks due to compromised
      Certification Authorities.

  "HTTP Header Field X-Frame-Options", David Ross, Tobias Gondrom,

      To improve the protection of web applications against Clickjacking,
      this specification describes the X-Frame-Options HTTP response header
      field that declares a policy communicated from the server to the
      client browser on whether the browser may display the transmitted
      content in frames that are part of other web pages.  This
      informational document serves to document the existing use and
      specification of this X-Frame-Options HTTP response header field.

  "Web Security Framework: Problem Statement and Requirements", Jeff
  Hodges, 2013-02-18, <draft-ietf-websec-framework-reqs-00.txt>

      Web-based malware and attacks are proliferating rapidly on the
      Internet.  New web security mechanisms are also rapidly growing in
      number, although in an incoherent fashion.  This document provides a
      brief overview of the present situation and the various seemingly
      piece-wise approaches being taken to mitigate the threats.  It then
      provides an overview of requirements as presently being expressed by
      the community in various online and face-to-face discussions.

  "Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) Session Continuation: Problem
  Statement", Nico Williams, 2013-07-07,
  <draft-ietf-websec-session-continue-prob-00.txt>

      One of the most often talked about problems in web security is
      "cookies".  Web cookies are a method of associating requests with
      "sessions" that may have been authenticated somehow.  Cookies are a
      form of bearer token that leave much to be desired.  This document
      describes the session "continuation" problem for the HyperText
      Transport Protocol (HTTP).

      This document describes uniform patterns to construct HTTP URLs that
      may be used to retrieve registration information from registries
      (including both Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name
      Registries (DNRs)) using "RESTful" web access patterns.

  "Security Services for the Registration Data Access Protocol", Scott
  Hollenbeck, Ning Kong, 2013-06-03, <draft-ietf-weirds-rdap-sec-04.txt>

      The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) provides "RESTful" web
      services to retrieve registration metadata from domain name and
      regional internet registries.  This document describes information
      security services including authentication, authorization,
      availability, data confidentiality, and data integrity for RDAP.

  "HTTP usage in the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)", Andrew

  <draft-ietf-weirds-using-http-07.txt>

      This document is one of a collection that together describe the
      Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP).  It describes how RDAP is
      transported using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

  "Redirection Service for Registration Data Access Protocol", Carlos
  Martinez, Arturo Servin, Linlin Zhou, Dario Gomez, Gerardo Rada,
  2013-07-15, <draft-ietf-weirds-redirects-02.txt>

      The traditional WHOIS protocol has several important shortcomings,
      and over the past few years several approaches to a better
      Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) have been discussed and
      proposed.
      
      It is worth noting that the term WHOIS is sometimes used
      interchangeably to mean either (a) the registration data itself or
      (b) the protocol used to access registration data
      
      Among these shortcomings, different registries operate different
      WHOIS services.  For users this means that several WHOIS queries to
      different registries may be necessary in order to obtain data for a
      given resource.
      
      This document describes a redirection service for RDAP queries.  This
      service allows clients to query a single RDAP service and expect
      either an authoritative answer or a redirection hint pointing to
      another, possibly authoritative, RDAP server.
      
      The solution implemented proposed here applies to Regional Internet
      Registries(RIRs) and Domain Name Registries(DNRs).

      The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction with the Real-
      time Transport Protocol (RTP) in to provide a variety of short-term
      and long-term reception statistics.  The available reporting may
      include aggregate information across longer periods of time as well
      as individual packet reporting.  This document specifies a per-packet
      report metric capturing individual packets discarded from the jitter
      buffer after successful reception.

  <draft-ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-decodability-12.txt>

      An MPEG2 Transport Stream (TS) is a standard container format used in
      the transmission and storage of multimedia data.  Unicast/Multicast
      MPEG2 TS over RTP is widely deployed in IPTV systems.  This document
      defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block
      that allows the reporting of MPEG2 TS decodability statistics metrics
      related to transmissions of MPEG2 TS over RTP.  The metrics specified
      in the RTCP XR Block are not dependent on Program specific
      information carried in MPEG TS.
