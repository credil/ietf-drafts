1. Introduction

   3GPP mobile cellular networks such as GSM, UMTS, and LTE have
   architectural support for IPv6 [RFC6459], but only 3GPP Release-10
   and onwards of the 3GPP specification supports DHCPv6 [RFC3633] for
   delegating IPv6 addresses to a tethered LAN.  To facilitate the use
   of IPv6 in a tethered LAN prior to deployment of DHCPv6 in a 3GPP
   network, this document describes how the 3GPP User Equipment (UE)
   interface assigned /64 subnet may be shared from the 3GPP interface
   to a tethered LAN.  This is achieved by specifying the UE 3GPP
   interface as an IPv6 /128 subnet taken from the 3GPP interface's
   network assigned /64 subnet.  Then, assign the same address to the
   tethered LAN interface with the full /64 subnet.  The /64 tethered
   LAN subnet will then be advertised to the tethered LAN via Router
   Advertisements (RA) [RFC4861].  

   The end result is that all UE interfaces have link-local IPv6
   addresses, the UE's 3GPP interface has a /128 address from the 3GPP
   network assigned /64, and the same address that is assigned to the
   3GPP interface is assigned to the tethered LAN interface with a /64
   subnet and advertised to the LAN via RA.  This approach only impacts
   the UE configuration and does not require any changes to the 3GPP
   network.


2. The Challenge of Providing IPv6 Addresses to a 3GPP Tethered LAN

   As described in [RFC6459], 3GPP networks assign a /64 subnet to the
   UE with RA.  IPv6 prefix delegation is a part of 3GPP Release-10 and
   is not covered by any earlier releases.  Neighbor Discovery Proxy (ND
   Proxy) [RFC4389] functionality has been suggested as an option for
   sharing the assigned /64 from the 3GPP interface to the LAN, but ND
   Proxy is an experimental protocol and has some limitations with loop-
   avoidance.

   DHCPv6 is the best way to assign subnets to tethered LANs.  The
   method described in this document should only be applied when
   deploying DHCPv6 is not achievable in the 3GPP network.

3. Method for Sharing the 3GPP Interface /64 to the Tethered LAN

   As [RFC6459] describes, the 3GPP network assigned /64 is completely
   dedicated to the UE and the gateway does not consume any of the /64
   addresses.  Communication between the UE and the gateway is only done
   using link-local addresses and the link is point-to-point.  This
   allows for the UE to use the 3GPP network assigned /64 to assign
   itself a /128 subnet address to the 3GPP radio interface for
   consistent network reachability and the same address with a /64

   subnet to the tethered LAN interface.  The tethered LAN interface may
   then advertise the /64 subnet to the LAN with RA.

   For example, if the 3GPP network assigns to the UE via RA the subnet
   2001:db8:ac10:f002::/64, the UE may choose the address for its 3GPP
   interface to be 2001:db8:ac10:f002:1234:4567::9/128.  When tethering
   a LAN, the UE may then assign that same address to its LAN interface
   with a /64 subnet, such as 2001:db8:ac10:f002:1234:4567::9/64.  The
   UE may then advertise the 2001:db8:ac10:f002::/64 subnet to the
   tethered LAN using RA.  Since the UE only consumes one address from
   the 3GPP network assigned /64 for both the 3GPP interface and the LAN
   interface, there is no address conflict potential.  On the LAN, the
   /64 subnet is announced via RA and the interface address is defended
   with Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) [RFC4862].  Since the 3GPP
   interface is a point-to-point link and the gateway does not consume
   an address from the network assigned /64, there is no chance of
   address conflict on the 3GPP interface for the /64.

   The UE should be compliant with the relevant requirements in [I-
   D.binet-v6ops-cellular-host-reqs-rfc3316update].

4. Security Considerations

   Security considerations identified in [I-D.binet-v6ops-cellular-host-
   reqs-rfc3316update] are to be taken into account.

5. IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action from IANA.
