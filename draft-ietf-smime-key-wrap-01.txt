This document specifies the algorithm for wrapping one Triple-DES
key with another Triple-DES key and the algorithm for wrapping
one RC2 key with another RC2 key.  These key wrap algorithms
were originally published in section 12.6 of RFC 2630.  They
are republished since these key wrap algorithms have been found to be
useful in contexts beyond those supported by RFC 2630.

This document is a product of the S/MIME Mail Security Working Group
of the IETF.
