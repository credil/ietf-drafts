      Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification version 2 (VCCV2)
                     draft-nadeau-pwe3-vccv2-00.txt

Abstract

   This document describes VCCV2, a new version of Virtual Circuit
   Connectivity Verification (VCCV), the pseudowire OAM mechanism.  This
   new version is backwards compatible with VCCV for MPLS PWs for modes
   that the versions share, although the Router Alert (RA) CV type is
   not supported by VCCV2.  Furthermore, this document collects the
   complete description of VCCV2 into a single specification.

1.  Introduction

   Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV), the pseudowire OAM
   mechanism is described in [RFC5085], [RFC5885], and
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-vccv-for-gal].  This mechanism has been widely
   implemented and deployed, but it has been reported
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-vccv-impl-survey-results] that the large number of
   VCCV options has led to interoperability issues.

   [RFC5085] together with [I-D.ietf-pwe3-vccv-for-gal] define four
   Control Channel (CC) types for MPLS PWs:
   Type 1  using the control word (CW),
   Type 2  using the Router Alert label (label=1) above the PW label,
   Type 3  using TTL expiry,
   Type 4  using G-ACh Label (label=13) [RFC5586] below the PW label.
   In order to simplify implementations and operations, we herein
   obsolete Type 2, and provide guidance as to when to use the remaining
   three types.

   [RFC5085] together with [RFC5885] define four Connectivity
   Verification (CV) types for MPLS PWs:
      ICMP ping,
      LSP ping,
      BFD with UDP/IP encapsulation,
      raw BFD (without IP encapsulation),
   and BFD has several options of its own (see [RFC5880]).  The
   description of what and how to implement these is spread over several
   documents, and we herein attempt to summarize the entire
   functionality set in one place.

   This document only describes OAM for PWs over MPLS.  Functionality
   for L2TPv2-based PWs remains as presently specified.

   The present version of this document is a skeleton only, intended to
   initiate discussion.  Once the principles are agreed upon, the
   authors will flesh out the rest.


2.  Overview of the PW OAM Channel

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   VCCV and VCCV2 are fault OAM mechanisms to verify liveliness and to
   further diagnose the pseudowire forwarding path.  This section will
   provide an overview of the requirements and architecture of PW OAM.

4.  The Protocol and its Options

   This section will detail all the CC and CV options, the signaling
   needed to choose each of them, the bit-masks and codings.  The
   description will be concise, yet readable.

   In particular, CC Type 2 is obsoleted.  Subsections will discuss
   Types 1, 3, and 4.

   In addition, the text will provide guidance for selection of CC
   types, as follows: When the PW employs a CW then CC Type 1 SHOULD be
   used.  TDM PWs always use the CW, and thus SHOULD always use Type 1.
   Legacy (ATM, port mode frame relay, and HDLC PWs) without CWs SHOULD
   use Type 3.  [RFC5994] states that Ethernet PWs over MPLS-TP MUST use
   the CW, and thus they SHOULD use Type 1, but MAY use Type 4.

   Discussion is needed as to whether all CV types are required.
   Subsections will detail the use of the different CV types.


5.  Security Considerations

   Are there significant threats on PWs based on VCCV?


6.  IANA Considerations

   It is not clear what needs to be put here.  Will CC Type 2 be
   removed?
