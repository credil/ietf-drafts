Internet Draft         Requirement E-Tree in L2VPN            April 2013


1. Introduction 

   This document provides functional requirements for Metro Ethernet 
   Forum (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) support in multipoint L2VPN 
   solutions (referred to as simply L2VPN). It is intended that 
   potential solutions will use these requirements as guidelines. 

   Considerable number of service providers have adopted VPLS to provide 
   MEF Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) services to customers. Service Providers 
   currently need a simple and effective solution to emulate E-Tree 
   services in addition to E-LAN services on their MPLS networks.

   Service providers also expect E-Tree support in any newly developed 
   L2VPN technologies.

2. IETF Multipoint Ethernet L2VPN Services

2.1. VPLS 

   VPLS [RFC4761] [RFC4762] is a L2VPN service that provides multipoint-
   to-multipoint connectivity for Ethernet across an IP or MPLS-enabled 
   IP Packet Switched Network (PSN). VPLS emulates the Ethernet Virtual 
   Local Area Network (VLAN) functionality of traditional Ethernet 
   networks. Thus, in VPLS, the customer Ethernet frame is transported 
   over the IP/MPLS PSN from the ingress Provider Edge (PE) to the 
   egress PE where the destination is connected based on the Ethernet 
   frame destination MAC address.

2.2. E-VPN

   E-VPN is an enhanced Layer-2 service that emulates an Ethernet VLAN 
   across a PSN, primarily targeted to support large scale L2VPNs with 
   resiliency requirements not satisfied by other L2VPN solutions.

   E-VPN is currently under development. Please refer to [Draft EVPN 
   Req].

3. MEF Multipoint Ethernet Services

   MEF has defined two multipoint Ethernet Service types:
     - E-LAN (Ethernet LAN), multipoint-to-multipoint service
     - E-Tree (Ethernet Tree), rooted-multipoint service

   For full specification, please refer to [MEF6.1] [MEF10.2].

3.1. Similarity between E-LAN and E-Tree

   Following are the similarities between E-LAN and E-Tree services.
     - Data frame is Ethernet frame.
     - Data forwarding can be MAC-based forwarding, to be specified by 
       service provider as service frame delivery attributes in the 
       particular service definition.

Internet Draft         Requirement E-Tree in L2VPN            April 2013


     - A generic E-LAN/E-Tree service is always bidirectional in the 
       sense that ingress frames can originate at any endpoint in the 
       service.

3.2. Difference between E-LAN and E-Tree

   Within the context of a multipoint Ethernet service, each endpoint is 
   designated as either a Root or a Leaf. A Root can communicate with 
   all other endpoints in the same multipoint Ethernet service, however 
   a Leaf can only communicate with Roots but not Leafs.

   The only difference between E-LAN and E-Tree is:
     - E-LAN has Root endpoints only, which implies there is no 
       communication restriction between endpoints. 
     - E-Tree has both Root and Leaf endpoints, which implies there is a 
       need to enforce communication restriction between Leaf endpoints.

3.3. E-Tree Use Cases

Internet Draft         Requirement E-Tree in L2VPN            April 2013


   Common to all use cases, direct layer 2 Leaf-to-Leaf communication is 
   not required. For Mobile backhaul, this may not be valid for LTE X2 
   interfaces [MEF22.1].

   If direct layer 2 Leaf-to-Leaf communication is not allowed due to 
   security concern, then E-Tree should be used to prohibit 
   communication between Leaf endpoints, otherwise E-LAN is also a 
   feasible option.

3.4. Generic E-Tree Service

   A generic E-Tree service supports multiple Root endpoints. The need 
   for multiple Root endpoints is usually driven by redundancy 
   requirement. Whether a particular E-Tree service needs to support 
   single or multiple Roots depends on the target application.

   A generic E-Tree service supports all the following traffic flows:
     - Ethernet Unicast from Root to Leaf
     - Ethernet Unicast from Leaf to Root
     - Ethernet Unicast from Root to Root
     - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast from Root to Roots & Leafs
     - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast from Leaf to Roots
   A particular E-Tree service may need to support all the above or only 
   a subset depending on the target application.

4. Problem Statement

4.1. Motivation

   L2VPN can be used to emulate MEF E-LAN service over an MPLS network 
   provided that the E-LAN service uses MAC-based forwarding as a 
   service frame delivery attributes.

   Service providers also require E-Tree support in L2VPN.

4.2. Leaf-to-Leaf Communication Restriction

   In this section, VPLS is used to illustrate the problem, but the same 
   principle applies to other L2VPN technologies.

   VPLS treats all attachment circuits (ACs) equal (i.e. not classified 
   into Root or Leaf) and provides any-to-any connectivity among all 
   ACs. VPLS does not include any mechanism of communication restriction 
   between specific ACs, therefore it is insufficient for emulating 
   generic E-Tree service over IP/MPLS PSN.

   As an example of the problems not addressed in VPLS solutions, 
   consider the scenario in Figure 1 where there are two PEs, each with 
   a Root AC and a Leaf AC and where VPLS is used to emulate an E-Tree 
   service over an MPLS network.

                    +---------+            +---------+

   Figure 1: Problem Scenario for Leaf-to-Leaf Communication Restriction

   When PE2 receives a frame from PE1 via the Ethernet PW, 
     - PE2 does not know which AC on PE1 is the ingress AC
     - PE2 does not know whether the ingress AC is a Leaf AC or not
     - PE2 does not have sufficient information to enforce the 
       Leaf-to-Leaf communication restriction

   Examples where the problems arise:
     - CE2 sends a Broadcast/Multicast frame to PE1 via AC2
     - CE2 sends a Unicast frame to PE1 via AC2 with destination MAC 
       address corresponding to CE4's MAC address

   Note: Figure 1 is a hypothetical case solely used for explaining the 
   problem, and not meant to represent a typical E-Tree service.

   There are some possible ways to get around this problem that do not 
   require extension to existing VPLS solutions but they all come with
   significant design complexity or deployment constraints, please refer 
   to [Draft ETree Frwk] Appendix A.
 
5. Requirements

5.1. Functional Requirements

   A solution MUST prohibit communication between any two Leaf ACs in a 
   L2VPN instance.

   A solution MUST allow multiple Root ACs in a L2VPN instance.

   A solution MUST allow Root AC and Leaf AC of a L2VPN instance to 
   co-exist on any PE.

5.2. Applicability

   A solution MUST identify the L2VPN technology ([RFC4761], [RFC4762], 
   E-VPN) the solution is applicable to.

Internet Draft         Requirement E-Tree in L2VPN            April 2013


5.3. Backward Compatibility

   A solution SHOULD minimise the impact on VPLS and E-VPN L2VPN 
   solutions, especially for the MEF E-LAN services already in 
   operation.

   A solution SHOULD be backward compatible with the VPLS and E-VPN 
   L2VPN solutions. It SHOULD allow a case where a common L2VPN instance 
   is composed of both PEs supporting the solution and PEs not 
   supporting it, and the Leaf-to-Leaf communication restriction is 
   enforced within the scope of the compliant PEs.

5.4. External Network Network Interface

   A solution SHOULD support Root Operator Virtual Connection (OVC) End 
   Point, Leaf OVC End Point and Trunk OVC End Point specified in 
   [MEF26.1].

6. Security Considerations
    
   This document introduces a requirement of prohibiting communication 
   between any two Leaf ACs in a L2VPN instance. In some use cases, such 
   requirement is imposed because of security reasons. Other than that, 
   there are no additional security considerations beyond those already 
   described in [RFC4761] [RFC4762].

7. IANA Considerations 
    
   This document has no actions for IANA.

Internet Draft         Requirement E-Tree in L2VPN            April 2013


Appendix A. Frequently Asked Questions

A.1. Are E-Tree requirements addressed in the Virtual Private Multicast 
     Service (VPMS) requirements?

   VPMS requirements are defined in [Draft VPMS Frmwk].

   The focus of VPMS is to provide point-to-multipoint connectivity.

   VPMS provides single coverage of receiver membership (i.e. there is 
   no distinct differentiation for multiple multicast groups). A VPMS 
   service supports single or multiple Root ACs. All traffic from a Root 
   AC will be forwarded to all Leaf ACs (i.e. P2MP, from Root to all 
   Leafs). Destination address in Ethernet frame is not used in data 
   forwarding. As an optional capability, a VPMS service may support 
   reverse traffic from a Leaf AC to a Root AC (i.e. P2P, from Leaf to 
   Root).

   In contrast, the focus of MEF E-Tree is that a Leaf can only 
   communicate with Roots but not Leafs.

   A generic MEF E-Tree service supports multiple Root endpoints. 
   Whether a particular E-Tree service needs to support single or 
   multiple Root endpoints depends on the target application.

   A generic MEF E-Tree service supports all the following traffic 
   flows:
     - Ethernet Unicast bidirectional Root to/from Root 
     - Ethernet Unicast bidirectional Root to/from Leaf 
     - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast unidirectional Root to all Roots & 
       Leafs
     - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast unidirectional Leaf to all Roots. 
   A particular E-Tree service may need to support all the above or only 
   a subset depending on the target application.

   IETF's VPMS definition and MEF's E-Tree definition are significantly 
   different. 

   Only for special case E-Tree service where
     - No Unicast traffic from Root destined for a specific Leaf (or 
       there is no concern if such Unicast traffic is forwarded to all 
       Leafs)
     - No traffic between Roots
   VPMS will be able to meet the requirement. An example is E-Tree 
   service for content delivery application.

   For generic E-Tree service, VPMS will not be able to meet the 
   requirements.

A.2. Are there any potential deployment scenarios for a "VPLS Only" 
     solution?

   Yes, there are potential deployment scenarios for a "VPLS Only" 
   solution with enhancements to support E-Tree services, some examples 
   below.
