Internet-Draft        spectrum sub-band allocation              Jul 2012


1.  Introduction

   Two kinds of DWDM application is described in the newest version of
   [G.694.1], one is fixed grid, and the other is flexible grid.  Fixed
   grid is the traditional DWDM application with fixed channel slot
   width (e.g., 50GHz) which has been deployed in large scale in the
   network.  In current DWDM systems with different bit rates,
   completely freedom and indiscriminate positioning of various channels
   with respect to each other is likely to lead to dramatically impaired
   system performance due to XPM (Cross-phased Modulation) effect.

   The XPM effects are quite important for WDM systems because the phase
   of each optical channel depends on the bit patterns of all other
   channels.  For example, if we mix 10Gbit/s NRZ modulated channels
   with 100Gbit/s xPSK modulated channels indiscriminately, XPM would
   have a detrimental effect on the 100Gbit/s signal if this are caused
   by 10Gbit/s signal; Complex modulation formats (e.g., 16QAM) would be
   used to modulate signal beyond 100Gbit/s (e.g., 400Gbit/s, 1Tbit/s),
   while QAM modulation format experiences both intensity and phase
   modulation, a QAM signal may affect another QAM signal due to XPM
   effect.

   In current DWDM system with different bit rates, general advice is to
   group the channels with the same bit rates into the same spectrum
   sub-band to avoid the detrimental XPM effect.

   The flexible grid technology is also a DWDM application which is
   different from fixed grid application.  Flexible grid is a kind of
   new DWDM application with different channel slot width (e.g., 50GHz,
   87.5GHz etc).  Signals with different bit rates may occupy different
   slot widths and use different modulation format.  Grouping of signals
   with the same bit rates into the same spectrum may also be a better
   choice than completely freedom positioning.

   Frequently setup and release of flexible grid optical channels which
   occupy different slot widths would result in the spectrum fragments
   that can't be used anymore, and this will cause the decline of
   spectrum utilization rate.  Global Concurrent Optimization (GCO),
   which combines with the implementation of the stateful PCE, can be
   used for defragmentation and raise spectrum utilization rate.  But
   it's complicated to apply the GCO in current network, because this
   will involve a large scale of resources and computation.  Another
   method that can be used is to group the channels with the same bit
   rates into the same spectrum sub-band and this is also a feasible
   solution to help raise spectrum utilization rate.

   According to the previous description, grouping of channels with the
   same bit rates maybe a good choice to reduce the XPM effect and raise

   spectrum utilization rate, especially in network with different slot
   widths.  So in order to take the grouping into consideration during
   the path computation, a sub-band spectrum of the available spectrum
   SHOULD be allocated in advance and this spectrum allocation
   information SHOULD be known by path computation element when compute
   the path.  This document mainly addresses the routing protocol
   extension to support the advertisement of the spectrum allocation
   information.  Policy may be used by operator when split spectrum
   supported on a link into several sub-bands.  One spectrum sub-band
   can only be used for path (optical channel) setup with specific
   attributes, for example, with specific bitrates and/or modulation
   format.

3.  Overview of the Solution

   In current DWDM system with different bit rates, general advice is to
   group the channels with the same bit rates and modulation format into
   the same spectrum sub-band to avoid the detrimental XPM effect.  As
   signals of the same bitrates usually use the same modulation format
   on a specific link, this document mainly pays attention to grouping
   of channels with the same bitrates.  Figure 1 shows an example, in
   which part of the spectrum frequency slots (i.e., the left sub-band)
   are allocated to 10 Gbit/s channels while another part of the
   frequency slots (i.e., the right sub-band) are allocated to 100
   Gbit/s channels.  Currently an NRZ modulation format is employed for
   10 Gbit/s channels, while 40 Gbit/s and/or 100 Gbit/s channels are
   mostly phase-modulated (e.g. xPSK) signals.  As noted above it is
   common practice to keep an appropriate guard band between channels
   with different bit rates and/or modulation format to minimize
   nonlinear effects induced signal degradations and to group channels
   with the same bit rate and modulation format.

                        Figure 1: Group of Channels


   [Notes: According to the simulation results about grouped spectrum
   allocation and ungrouped spectrum allocation for 100Gbit/s and
   400Gbit/s transmissions are carried.  A grouped spectrum allocation
   only resulted in a small improvement (about 0.2 and 0.5 dB) compared
   to ungrouped spectrum allocation for 100G and 400G data transmissions
   respectively.  The penalty induced by mixed QPSK and 16QAM signals
   seems to be much smaller than in a QPSK and NRZ hybrid system.  This
   may be explained by the similar spectrum of the QPSK and 16QAM
   formats for the same baud rate.  These results seem to indicate that
   systems operated with only phase modulated signals may show
   significantly lower impairments compared to systems operated with a
   mix of NRZ and phase modulated signals.]

   [Note: we are not sure if grouping of channels with the same bit rate
   is needed in future.  According to the discussion in ITU-T, a part of
   the experts express that: we should use grouping of channels with the
   same bit rate in the short term, however, in the long term, it may be
   forced to use indiscriminate positioning of the spectrum.]

   Some other advantages are also brought if operator split available
   spectrum into several sub-bands and one spectrum sub-band can only be
   used for optical channel setup with the same bit rate.  A spectrum
   sub-band which can only be used for optical channel setup with the
   same bit rate will help reduce fragments.  Channels in the same
   spectrum group sub-band with the same bitrates looks almost like
   fixed grid technology with the same slot width, and they won't
   generate fragments in the process of path setup and release.  It may
   also be convenient for operator to manage the network if the operator
   groups the optical channel with the same bit rate.

   When control plane uses path computation element to setup an end-to-
   end path through the DWDM network, spectrum available information and
   restriction information (e.g., spectrum partition information) should
   be taken into consideration in order to compute a suitable end-to-end
   path.  The spectrum sub-band information needs to be advertised by
   routing protocol in order to help the path computation.  Section 4
   describes the extension of OSPF routing protocol to advertise these
   spectrum sub-band information in order to help path computation.

4.1.   Relationship with WSON

   WSON related work can be re-used in this document to advertise the
   spectrum group information.  This Section addresses the routing
   extension work of the features which is describe in the previous
   section base on the current WSON work in IETF CCAMP Group.  In the
   document [draft-ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode], a new link
   sub-TLV called Port Label Restrictions sub-TLV is defined.
   Descriptions about Port Label Restrictions sub-TLV in the draft
   [draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-general-constraints-ospf-te] are introduced
   here: "Port label restrictions describe the label restrictions that
   the network element (node) and link may impose on a port.  These
   restrictions represent what labels may or may not be used on a link
   and are intended to be relatively static.  More dynamic information
   is contained in the information on available labels.  Port label
   restrictions are specified relative to the port in general or to a
   specific connectivity matrix for increased modeling flexibility" and
   "For example, Port Label Restrictions describes the wavelength
   restrictions that the link and various optical devices such as OXCs,
   ROADMs, and waveband multiplexers may impose on a port in WSON".

   According to the previous description, the restrictions information
   carried in the port label restriction sub-TLV are used to represent
   what wavelength/spectrum may or may not be used on a link and are
   relatively static.  The spectrum group allocation information
   described in this document can be regarded as label restrictions
   which are imposed by network element (node) on a port, and the
   network element include various optical devices such as OXCs, ROADMs
   and waveband multiplexers and so on.  These spectrum sub-bands
   restrictions represent the spectrum allocation information and a
   spectrum sub-band can only be used for channels setup with specific
   bitrates and/or modulation format.  This restriction is relative
   static and can be carried in Port Label Restrictions sub-TLV.

4.2.  Extensions of OSPF Protocol to Support Spectrum Group Allocation

   Spectrum sub-band allocation information should be known by path
   computation element if operators want to compute an end-to-end
   optical channel path.  As described in the previous section, Port
   Label Restrictions sub-TLV can be used to carry this spectrum sub-
   band allocation restriction information.  Figure 1 is the format of
   Port Label Restrictions sub-TLV which is described in
   [draft-ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode] and definition of the
   parameters included in this sub-TLV can be found in this document.

4.2.1.  Spectrum sub-band Allocation by Bitrates

   As described in section 3, channels on a single fiber with the same
   bitrates usually use the same modulation format, especially when the
   equipments come from one vendor.  So here operator can split spectrum
   into several spectrum sub-bands by bitrates.  In this section, OSPF
   protocol is extended to cover the spectrum sub-bands allocation
   information by bitrates.

   The spectrum sub-bands allocation information by bitrates is needed
   in the process of path computation if an end-to-end path needs to be
   computed by path computation element and this information SHOULD be
   advertised by routing protocols.  Figure 3 gives a new kinds of Port
   Label Restrictions sub-TLV which mainly extent the Additional
   Restriction Parameters field to cover the spectrum sub-bands
   allocation information.  The parameters in the Additional Restriction
   Parameters field include Bit Rate which indicates the bitrates of the
   specific spectrum sub-bands and spectrum boundaries information of
   the sub-band.

   Definition of MatrixID and RestrictionType field can be found in the
   document [draft-ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode].  Value of
   RestrictionType needs to be assigned by IANA.

   [Note: As several routing documents exist in the CCAMP and the
   label_set object encoding is not determined, this document use
   "spectrum sub-band range" to represent spectrum allocation
   information temporarily.]

   "Bit Rate" field indicates the bitrates of the specific spectrum sub-
   band.

   In some situation, modulation format information may also be needed
   to help allocation wavelength range, as signals with the same
   bitrates on a single fiber can use different modulation format.  In
   this case, modulation formats information is needed to be carried in
   Port Label Restrictions sub-TLV.  Wavelength that is supported by
   subsystems can be partitioned to service traditional fixed grid
   technology.
