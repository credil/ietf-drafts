Extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
          to compute service aware Label Switched Path (LSP).

Abstract

   In certain networks like financial information network (stock/
   commodity trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications,
   Latency (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet loss is
   becoming a key requirement for path computation along with other
   constraints and metrics.  Latency, Latency-Variation and Packet Loss
   is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between
   customers and service providers.

   [MPLS-DELAY-FWK] describes MPLS architecture to allow latency, loss
   and jittering as properties.  [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS]
   describes mechanisms with which network performance information is
   distributed via OSPF and ISIS respectivily.  This document describes
   the extension to PCEP to carry Latency, Latency-Variation and Loss as
   constraints for end to end path computation.

1.  Introduction

   Real time Network Performance is becoming a critical in the path
   computation in some networks.  There exist mechanism described in
   [RFC6374] to measure latency, latency-Variation and packet loss after
   the LSP has been established, which is inefficient.  It's important
   that latency, latency-variation and packet loss are considered during
   path selection process itself.

   TED is populated with network performance information like link
   latency, latency variation and packet loss through [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS]
   or [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS].  Path Computation Client (PCC) can request Path
   Computation Element (PCE) to provide a path meeting end to end
   network performance criteria.  This document extends Path Computation
   Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440] to handle network
   performance constraint.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   IGP:  Interior Gateway Protocol.  Either of the two routing
      protocols, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Intermediate System
      to Intermediate System (IS-IS).

   IS-IS:  Intermediate System to Intermediate System.

   OSPF:  Open Shortest Path First.

   PCC:  Path Computation Client: any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   TE:  Traffic Engineering.

3.  Requirement for PCEP

   End-to-end service optimization based on latency, latency-variation
   and packet loss is a key requirement for service provider.  Following
   key requirements associated with latency, latency-variation and loss
   is identified for PCEP:

   1.  Path Computation Element (PCE) supporting this draft MUST have
       the capability to compute end-to-end path with latency, latency-
       variation and packet loss constraints.  It MUST also support the
       combination of network performance constraint (latency, latency-
       variation, loss...) with existing constraints (cost, hop-
       limit...)

   2.  Path Computation Client (PCC) supporting this draft MUST be able
       to request for network performance constraint in path request
       message as the key constraint to be optimized or to suggest
       boundary condition that should not be crossed.

   3.  PCEs are not required to support service aware path computation.
       Therefore, it MUST be possible for a PCE to reject a Path
       Computation Request message with a reason code that indicates no
       support for service-aware path computation.

   4.  PCEP supporting this draft SHOULD provide a means to return end
       to end network performance information of the computed path in
       the reply message.

   5.  PCEP supporting this draft SHOULD provide mechanism to compute
       multi-domain (e.g., Inter-AS, Inter-Area or Multi-Layer) service
       aware paths.

   It must be understood that such constraints are only meaningful if
   used consistently: for instance, if the delay of a computed path
   segment is exchanged between two PCEs residing in different domains,
   consistent ways of defining the delay must be used.

4.  Objects

   This section defines PCEP extensions (see [RFC5440]) so as to support
   network performance and service aware path computation.

   [RFC5440] defines the optional METRIC object for several purposes.
   In a PCReq message, a PCC MAY insert one or more METRIC objects to
   indicate the metric that MUST be optimized or to indicate a bound on
   the path that MUST NOT be exceeded for the path to be considered as
   acceptable by the PCC.  In a PCRep message, the METRIC object MAY be
   inserted so as to provide the value for the computed path.  It MAY

   also be inserted within a PCRep with the NO-PATH object to indicate
   that the metric constraint could not be satisfied.

   As per [RFC5440] the format of the METRIC object body is as follows:
       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |          Reserved             |    Flags  |C|B|       T       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                          metric-value                         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         T (Type - 8 bits):  Specifies the metric type.
         Three values are currently defined:
         *  T=1: IGP metric
         *  T=2: TE metric
         *  T=3: Hop Counts

   Based on the section 3, PCEP is extended to define new METRIC types
   for network performance constraints.

4.1.  Latency (Delay) Metric

   The end to end Latency (Delay) for the path is represented by this
   metric.

   * T=13(IANA): Latency metric

   PCC MAY use this latency metric In PCReq to request a path meeting
   the end to end latency requirement.  In this case B bit MUST be set
   to suggest a bound (a maximum) for the path latency metric that must
   not be exceeded for the PCC to consider the computed path as
   acceptable.  The path metric must be less than or equal to the value
   specified in the metric-value field.

   PCC MAY also use this metric to ask PCE to optimize delay during path
   computation, in this case B flag will be cleared.

   PCE MAY use this latency metric In PCRep along with NO-PATH object
   incase PCE cannot compute a path meeting this constraint.  PCE MAY
   also use this metric to reply the computed end to end latency metric
   to PCC.

   The metric value represents the end to end Latency (delay) measured
   in milliseconds.

4.2.  Latency Variation (Jitter) Metric

   The end to end Latency Variation (Jitter) for the path is represented
   by this metric.

   * T=14(IANA): Latency Variation metric

   PCC MAY use this latency variation metric In PCReq to request a path
   meeting the end to end latency variation requirement.  In this case B
   bit MUST be set to suggest a bound (a maximum) for the path latency
   variation metric that must not be exceeded for the PCC to consider
   the computed path as acceptable.  The path metric must be less than
   or equal to the value specified in the metric-value field.

   PCC MAY also use this metric to ask PCE to optimize jitter during
   path computation, in this case B flag will be cleared.

   PCE MAY use this latency variation metric In PCRep along with NO-PATH
   object incase PCE cannot compute a path meeting this constraint.  PCE
   MAY also use this metric to reply the computed end to end latency
   variation metric to PCC.

   The metric value represents the end to end Latency variation (jitter)
   measured in microseconds.

4.3.  Packet Loss Metric

   The end to end Packet Loss for the path is represented by this
   metric.

   * T=15(IANA): Packet Loss metric

   PCC MAY use this packet loss metric In PCReq to request a path
   meeting the end to end packet loss requirement.  In this case B bit
   MUST be set to suggest a bound (a maximum) for the path packet loss
   metric that must not be exceeded for the PCC to consider the computed
   path as acceptable.  The path metric must be less than or equal to
   the value specified in the metric-value field.

   PCC MAY also use this metric to ask PCE to optimize packet loss
   during path computation, in this case B flag will be cleared.

   PCE MAY use this packet loss metric In PCRep along with NO-PATH
   object incase PCE cannot compute a path meeting this constraint.  PCE
   MAY also use this metric to reply the computed end to end packet loss
   metric to PCC.

   The metric value represents the end to end packet loss measured as a

   percentage and represented in 32 bit floating point.

4.4.  Non-Understanding / Non-Support of Service Aware Path Computation

   If the P bit is clear in the object header and PCE doesn't understand
   or doesn't support service aware path computation it SHOULD simply
   ignore this METRIC.

   If the P Bit is set in the object header and PCE receives new METRIC
   type in path request and it understands the METRIC type, but the PCE
   is not capable of service aware path computation, the PCE MUST send a
   PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR Object Error-Type = 4 (Not supported
   object) [RFC5440].  The path computation request MUST then be
   cancelled.

   If the PCE does not understand the new METRIC type, then the PCE MUST
   send a PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR Object Error-Type = 3 (Unknown
   object) [RFC5440].

4.5.  Mode of Operation

   As explained in [RFC5440], The METRIC object is optional and can be
   used for several purposes.  In a PCReq message, a PCC MAY insert one
   or more METRIC objects:

   o  To indicate the metric that MUST be optimized by the path
      computation algorithm (Latency, Latency-Variation or Loss)

   o  To indicate a bound on the path METRIC (Latency, Latency-Variation
      or Loss) that MUST NOT be exceeded for the path to be considered
      as acceptable by the PCC.

   In a PCRep message, the METRIC object MAY be inserted so as to
   provide the METRIC (Latency, Latency-Variation or Loss) for the
   computed path.  It MAY also be inserted within a PCRep with the NO-
   PATH object to indicate that the metric constraint could not be
   satisfied.

   The path computation algorithmic aspects used by the PCE to optimize
   a path with respect to a specific metric are outside the scope of
   this document.

   All the rules of processing METRIC object as explained in [RFC5440]
   are applicable to the new metric types as well.

4.5.1.  Examples

   If a PCC sends a path computation request to a PCE where the metric
   to optimize is the latency and the packet loss must not exceed the
   value of M, two METRIC objects are inserted in the PCReq message:

   o  First METRIC object with B=0, T=13, C=1, metric-value=0x0000

   o  Second METRIC object with B=1, T=15, metric-value=M

   If a path satisfying the set of constraints can be found by the PCE
   and there is no policy that prevents the return of the computed
   metric, the PCE inserts one METRIC object with B=0, T=13, metric-
   value= computed end to end latency.  Additionally, the PCE may insert
   a second METRIC object with B=1, T=15, metric-value= computed end to
   end packet loss.

5.  Protocol Consideration

   There is no change in the message format of Path Request and Reply
   Message.

5.1.  Inter domain Consideration

   [RFC5441] describes the BRPC procedure to compute end to end
   optimized inter domain path by cooperating PCEs.  The network
   performance constraints can be applied end to end in similar manner
   as IGP or TE cost.

   All domains should have the same understanding of the METRIC
   (Latency-Variation etc) for end-to-end inter-domain path computation
   to make sense.  Otherwise some form of Metric Normalization as
   described in [RFC5441] MAY need to be applied.

5.1.1.  Inter-AS Link

   The IGP in each neighbor domain can advertise its inter-domain TE
   link capabilities, this has been described in [RFC5316] (ISIS) and
   [RFC5392] (OSPF).  The network performance link properties are
   described in [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS], the same
   properties must be advertised using the mechanism described in
   [RFC5392] (OSPF) and [RFC5316] (ISIS).

5.1.2.  Inter-Layer Consideration

   PCEP supporting this draft SHOULD provide mechanism to support
   differnt Metric requirements for different Layers.  This is important
   as the network performance metric would be different for Packet and

Internet-Draft                SERVICE-AWARE                December 2011


   Optical (TDM, LSC etc) Layers.  In order to allow different Metric-
   Value to be applied within different network layers, multiple METRIC
   objects of the same type MAY be present.  In such a case, the first
   METRIC object specifies an metric for the higher-layer network, and
   subsequent METRIC objects specify objection functions of the
   subsequent lower-layer networks.

5.2.  Reoptimization Consideration

   PCC can monitor the setup LSPs and incase of degradation of network
   performance constraints, it MAY ask PCE for reoptimization as per
   [RFC5440].

5.3.  P2MP

   The scope of the network performance constraints as listed in this
   document needs to be described in terms of P2MP TE LSPs.

   This section needs further discussions.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has defined a registry for new METRIC type.

                 Type        Meaning
                 13(TBD)     Latency (delay) metric
                 14(TBD)     Latency Variation (jitter) metric
                 15(TBD)     Packet Loss metric

7.  Security Considerations

   This document defines three new METRIC Types with does not add any
   new security concerns to PCEP protocol.

8.  Manageability Considerations

8.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   The only configurable item is the support of the new service-aware
   METRICS on a PCE which MAY be controlled by a policy module.  If the
   new METRIC is not supported/allowed on a PCE, it MUST send a PCErr
   message as specified in Section 4.4.

8.2.  Information and Data Models

   [PCEP-MIB] describes the PCEP MIB, there are no new MIB Objects for
   this document.

8.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

8.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440].

8.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   PCE requires the TED to be populated with network performance
   information like link latency, latency variation and packet loss.
   This mechanims is described in [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] or
   [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS].

8.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not have any impact on network
   operations in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440].
