     A Framework for Point-to-Multipoint MPLS in Transport Networks
                  draft-fbb-mpls-tp-p2mp-framework-04

Abstract

   The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
   is the common set of MPLS protocol functions defined to enable the
   construction and operation of packet transport networks.  The MPLS-TP
   supports both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint transport paths.
   This document defines the elements and functions of the MPLS-TP
   architecture applicable specifically to supporting point-to-
   multipoint transport paths.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

Internet-Draft    MPLS Transport Profile P2MP Framework        June 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
   is the common set of MPLS protocol functions defined to meet the
   requirements specified in [RFC5654].  The MPLS-TP Framework [RFC5921]
   provides an overall introduction to the MPLS-TP and defines the
   general architecture of the Transport Profile, as well as those
   aspects specific to point-to-point transport paths.  The purpose of
   this document is to define the elements and functions of the MPLS-TP
   architecture applicable specifically to supporting point-to-
   multipoint transport paths.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

1.1.  Scope

   This document defines the elements and functions of the MPLS-TP
   architecture related to supporting point-to-multipoint transport
   paths.  The reader is referred to [RFC5921] for those aspects of the
   MPLS-TP architecture that are generic, or concerned specifically with
   point-to-point transport paths.

1.2.1.  Additional Definitions and Terminology

   Detailed definitions and additional terminology may be found in
   [RFC5921] and [RFC5654].

1.3.  Applicability

   The point-to-multipoint connectivity provided by an MPLS-TP network
   is based on the point-to-multipoint connectivity provided by MPLS
   networks.  MPLS TE-LSP support is discussed in [RFC4875] and
   [RFC5332], and PW support is being developed based on
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw-requirements] and
   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpms-frmwk-requirements].  MPLS-TP point-to-
   multipoint connectivity is analogous to that provided by traditional
   transport technologies such as Optical Transport Network (OTN) point-
   to-multipoint [ref?] and optical drop-and-continue [ref?], and thus
   supports the same class of traditional applications.

2.  MPLS Transport Profile Point-to-Multipoint Requirements

   The requirements for MPLS-TP are specified in [RFC5654], [RFC5860],
   and [RFC5951].  This section provides a brief summary of point-to-

   multipoint transport requirements as set out in those documents; the
   reader is referred to the documents themselves for the definitive and
   complete list of requirements.

   o  MPLS-TP must support unidirectional point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
      transport paths.

   o  MPLS-TP must support traffic-engineered point-to-multipoint
      transport paths.

   o  MPLS-TP must be capable of using P2MP server (sub)layer
      capabilities as well as P2P server (sub)layer capabilities when
      supporting P2MP MPLS-TP transport paths.

   o  The MPLS-TP control plane must support establishing all the
      connectivity patterns defined for the MPLS-TP data plane (i.e.,
      unidirectional P2P, associated bidirectional P2P, co-routed
      bidirectional P2P, unidirectional P2MP) including configuration of
      protection functions and any associated maintenance functions.

   o  Recovery techniques used for P2P and P2MP should be identical to
      simplify implementation and operation.

   o  Unidirectional 1+1 and 1:n protection for P2MP connectivity must
      be supported.

   o  MPLS-TP recovery in a ring must protect unidirectional P2MP
      transport paths.

3.  Architecture

   The overall architecture of the MPLS Transport Profile is defined in
   [RFC5921].  The architecture for point-to-multipoint MPLS-TP
   comprises the following additional elements and functions:

   o  Unidirectional point-to-multipoint Label Switched Paths (LSPs)

   o  Unidirectional point-to-multipoint pseudowires (PWs)

   o  Optional point-to-multipoint LSP and PW control planes

   o  Survivability, network management, and Operations, Administration
      and Maintenance (OAM) functions for point-to-multipoint PWs and
      LSPs

   The following subsections summarise the encapsulation and forwarding
   of point-to-multipoint traffic within an MPLS-TP network, and the
   encapsulation options for delivery of traffic to and from MPLS-TP

   Customer Edge devices when the network is providing a packet
   transport service.

3.1.  MPLS-TP Encapsulation and Forwarding

   Packet encapsulation and forwarding for MPLS-TP point-to-multipoint
   LSPs is identical to that for MPLS-TE point-to-multipoint LSPs.
   MPLS-TE point-to-multipoint LSPs were introduced in [RFC4875] and the
   related data-plane behaviour was further clarified in [RFC5332].
   MPLS-TP allows for both upstream-assigned and downstream-assigned
   labels for use with point-to-multipoint LSPs.

   Packet encapsulation and forwarding for point-to-multipoint PWs is
   currently being defined by the PWE3 Working Group
   [I-D.raggarwa-pwe3-p2mp-pw-encaps].

4.  Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)

   The overall OAM architecture for MPLS-TP is defined in [RFC6371].

   [Editor's note: This section will contain a summary of point-to-
   multipoint OAM as described in the OAM Framework.]

5.  Control Plane

   The overall control plane architecture for MPLS-TP is defined in
   [RFC6373].

   [Editor's note: This section will contain a summary of the point-to-
   multipoint control plane as described in the Control Plane
   Framework.]

5.1.  Point-to-Multipoint LSP Control Plane

   The MPLS-TP control plane for point-to-multipoint LSPs uses
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) and is based on Resource Reservation
   Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for point-to-multipoint LSPs
   as defined in [RFC4875].

5.2.  Point-to-Multipoint PW Control Plane

   The MPLS-TP control plane for point-to-multipoint pseudowires is
   based on the LDP P2MP signaling extensions for PWs defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw].

Internet-Draft    MPLS Transport Profile P2MP Framework        June 2012


6.  Survivability

   The overall survivability architecture for MPLS-TP is defined in
   [RFC6372].

   [Editor's note: This section will contain a summary of point-to-
   multipoint survivability as described in the Survivability
   Framework.]

7.  Network Management

   The network management architecture and requirements for MPLS-TP are
   specified in [RFC5951].  They derive from the generic specifications
   described in ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 [G.7710] for transport technologies.
   They also incorporate the OAM requirements for MPLS Networks
   [RFC4377] and MPLS-TP Networks [RFC5860] and expand on those
   requirements to cover the modifications necessary for fault,
   configuration, performance, and security in a transport network.

   [Editor's note: Decide what if anything needs to be said about P2MP-
   specific network management considerations.]

8.  Security Considerations

   General security considerations for MPLS-TP are noted in [RFC5921],
   and security considerations for point-to-multipoint PWs and LSPs in
   the documents that define them.  This document introduces no new
   security considerations in itself.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA considerations resulting from specific elements of MPLS-TP
   functionality are detailed in the documents specifying that
   functionality.  This document introduces no additional IANA
   considerations in itself.
