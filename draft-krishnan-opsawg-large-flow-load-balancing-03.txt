Abstract

   Demands on networking infrastructure are growing exponentially; the
   drivers are bandwidth hungry rich media applications, inter-data
   center communications, etc. In this context, it is important to
   optimally use the bandwidth in wired networks that extensively use
   LAG/ECMP techniques for bandwidth scaling. This draft explores some
   of the mechanisms useful for achieving this.

1. Introduction

   Networks extensively use LAG/ECMP techniques for capacity scaling.
   Network traffic can be predominantly categorized into two traffic
   types: long-lived large flows and other flows (which include long-
   lived small flows, short-lived small/large flows). Stateless hash-
   based techniques [ITCOM, RFC 2991, RFC 2992, RFC 6790] are often used
   to distribute both long-lived large flows and other flows over the
   component links in a LAG/ECMP. However the traffic may not be evenly
   distributed over the component links due to the traffic pattern.

   This draft describes best practices for optimal LAG/ECMP component
   link utilization while using hash-based techniques. These best
   practices comprise the following steps -- recognizing long-lived
   large flows in a router; and assigning the long-lived large flows to
   specific LAG/ECMP component links or redistributing other flows when
   a component link on the router is congested.

2. Hash-based Load Distribution in LAG/ECMP

   Hashing techniques are often used for traffic load balancing to
   select among multiple available paths with LAG/ECMP. The advantages
   of hash-based load distribution are the preservation of the packet
   sequence in a flow and the real-time distribution without maintaining
   per-flow state in the router. Hash-based techniques use a combination


Krishnan               Expires August 13, 2013                 [Page 4]

   of fields in the packet's headers to identify a flow, and the hash
   function on these fields is used to generate a unique number that
   identifies a link/path in a LAG/ECMP. The result of the hashing
   procedure is a many-to-one mapping of flows to component links.

   If the traffic load constitutes flows such that the result of the
   hash function across these flows is fairly uniform so that a similar
   number of flows is mapped to each component link, if, the individual
   flow rates are much smaller as compared to the link capacity, and if
   the rate differences are not dramatic, the hash-based algorithm
   produces good results with respect to utilization of the individual
   component links. However, if one or more of these conditions are not
   met, hash-based techniques may result in unbalanced loads on
   individual component links.

   One example is illustrated in Figure 1.  In the figure, there are two
   routers, R1 and R2, and there is a LAG between them which has 3
   component links (1), (2), (3).  There are a total of 10 flows that
   need to be distributed across the links in this LAG.  The result of
   hashing is as follows:

     .  Component link (1) has 3 flows -- 2 small flows and 1 large
        flow -- and the link utilization is normal.

     .  Component link (2) has 3 flows -- 3 small flows and no large
        flow -- and the link utilization is light.

          o The absence of any large flow causes the component link
             under-utilized.

     .  Component link (3) has 4 flows -- 2 small flows and 2 large
        flows -- and the link capacity is exceeded resulting in
        congestion.

          o The presence of 2 large flows causes congestion on this
             component link.

   This document presents improved load distribution techniques based on
   the large flow awareness. The techniques compensate for unbalanced
   load distribution resulting from hashing as demonstrated in the above
   example.

3. Mechanisms for Optimal LAG/ECMP Component Link Utilization

   The suggested techniques in this draft are about a local optimization
   solution; they are local in the sense that both the identification of
   large flows and re-balancing of the load can be accomplished
   completely within individual nodes in the network without the need
   for interaction with other nodes.

   This approach may not yield a globally optimal placement of large
   flows across multiple nodes in a network, which may be desirable in
   some networks. On the other hand, a local approach may be adequate
   for some environments for the following reasons:




Krishnan               Expires August 13, 2013                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   Optimal Load Distribution over LAG/ECMP  February 2013


      1) Different links within a network experience different levels of
   utilization and, thus, a "targeted" solution is needed for those hot-
   spots in the network.  An example is the utilization of a LAG between
   two routers that needs to be optimized.

      2) Some networks may lack end-to-end visibility, e.g. when a
   certain network, under the control of a given operator, is a transit
   network for traffic from other networks that are not under the
   control of the same operator.

   The various steps in achieving optimal LAG/ECMP component link
   utilization in networks are detailed below:

   Step 1) This involves large flow recognition in routers and
   maintaining the mapping of the large flow to the component link that
   it uses. The recognition of large flows is explained in Section 3.1.

   Step 2) The egress component links are periodically scanned for link
   utilization. If the egress component link utilization exceeds a pre-
   programmed threshold, an operator alert is generated. The large flows
   mapped to the congested egress component link are exported to a
   central management entity.

   Step 3) On receiving the alert about the congested component link,
   the operator, through a central management entity, finds the large
   flows mapped to that component link and the LAG/ECMP group to which
   the component link belongs.

   Step 4) The operator can choose to rebalance the large flows on
   lightly loaded component links of the LAG/ECMP group or redistribute
   the small flows on the congested link to other component links of the
   group. The operator, through a central management entity, can choose
   one of the following actions:

      1) Indicate specific large flows to rebalance;

      2) Have the router decide the best large flows to rebalance;

      3) Have the router redistribute all the small flows on the
   congested link to other component links in the group.

   The central management entity conveys the above information to the
   router. The load re-balancing options are explained in Section 3.2.

   Steps 2) to 4) could be automated if desired.

Internet-Draft   Optimal Load Distribution over LAG/ECMP  February 2013


   Providing large flow information to a central management entity
   provides the capability to further optimize flow distribution at with
   multi-node visibility.  Consider the following example.  A router may
   have 3 ECMP nexthops that lead down paths P1, P2, and P3.  A couple
   of hops downstream on P1 may be congested, while P2 and P3 may be
   under-utilized, which the local router does not have visibility into.
   With the help of a central management entity, the operator could
   redistribute some of the flows from P1 to P2 and P3 resulting in a
   more optimized flow of traffic.

   The techniques described above are especially useful when bundling
   links of different bandwidths for e.g. 10Gbps and 100Gbps as
   described in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-cl-requirement].

3.1. Large Flow Recognition

3.1.1. Flow Identification

   A flow (large flow or small flow) can be defined as a sequence of
   packets for which ordered delivery should be maintained.  Flows are
   typically identified using one or more fields from the packet header
   from the following list:

     .  Layer 2: source MAC address, destination MAC address, VLAN ID.

     .  IP header: IP Protocol, IP source address, IP destination
        address, flow label (IPv6 only), TCP/UDP source port, TCP/UDP
        destination port.

     .  MPLS Labels.

   For tunneling protocols like GRE, VXLAN, NVGRE, STT, etc., flow
   identification is possible based on inner and/or outer headers. The
   above list is not exhaustive.  The mechanisms described in this
   document are agnostic to the fields that are used for flow
   identification.

3.1.2. Criteria for Identifying a Large Flow

   From a bandwidth and time duration perspective, in order to identify
   large flows we define an observation interval and observe the
   bandwidth of the flow over that interval.  A flow that exceeds a
   certain minimum bandwidth threshold over that observation interval
   would be considered a large flow.

   The two parameters -- the observation interval, and the minimum
   bandwidth threshold over that observation interval -- should be


Krishnan               Expires August 13, 2013                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft   Optimal Load Distribution over LAG/ECMP  February 2013


   programmable in a router to facilitate handling of different use
   cases and traffic characteristics. For example, a flow which is at or
   above 100 Mbps for a time period of at least 5 minutes could be
   declared a large flow. Various techniques to identify a large flow
   are described below.

3.1.3. Sampling Techniques

   A number of routers support sampling techniques such as sFlow [sFlow-
   v5, sFlow-LAG], PSAMP [RFC 5475] and Netflow Sampling [RFC 3954].
   For the purpose of large flow identification, sampling must be
   enabled on all of the egress ports in the router.

   For example, through sFlow processing in a sFlow collector, an
   approximate indication of the large flows mapping to each of the
   component links in each LAG/ECMP group is available.

   If egress sampling is not available, ingress sampling can suffice
   since the central management entity used by the sampling technique
   typically has multi-node visibility and can use the samples from an
   immediately downstream node to make measurements for egress traffic
   at the local node.  This may not be available if the downstream
   device is under the control of a different operator, or if the
   downstream device does not support sampling.

   The advantages and disadvantages of sampling techniques are as
   follows.

   Advantages:

     .  Supported in most routers.

     .  Requires minimal router resources.

   Disadvantages:

     .  There is a delay in the recognition time for large flows, and
        in the time that it takes to react to this information.

   With sampling, the detection of large flows can be done on the order
   of one to a few seconds [DevoFlow].

3.1.4. Automatic Hardware Recognition

   Implementations may perform automatic recognition of large flows in
   hardware on a router. Since this is done in hardware, it is an inline
   solution and would be expected to operate at line rate.


Krishnan               Expires August 13, 2013                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft   Optimal Load Distribution over LAG/ECMP  February 2013


   Using automatic hardware recognition of large flows, a faster
   indication of large flows mapped to each of the component links in a
   LAG/ECMP group is available (as compared to the sampling approach
   described above).

   The advantages and disadvantages of automatic hardware recognition
   are:

   Advantages:

     .  Accurate and performed in real-time.

   Disadvantages:

     .  Not supported in many routers.

   As mentioned earlier, the observation interval for determining a
   large flow and the bandwidth threshold for classifying a flow as a
   large flow should be programmable parameters in a router.

   The implementation of automatic hardware recognition of large flows
   is vendor dependent. Below is a suggested technique.

   This technique requires a few tables -- a flow table, and multiple
   hash tables.

   The flow table comprises entries which are programmed with packet
   fields for flows that are already known to be large flows and each
   entry has a corresponding byte counter.  It is initialized as an
   empty table (i.e. none of the incoming packets would match a flow
   table entry).

   The hash tables each have a different hash function and comprise
   entries which are byte counters.  The counters are initialized to
   zero and would be modified as described by the algorithm below.

   Step 1) If the large flow exists in the flow table (for e.g. TCAM),
   increment the counter associated with the flow by the packet size.
   Else, proceed to Step 2.

   Step 2) The hash function for each table is applied to the fields of
   the packet header and the result is looked up in parallel in
   corresponding hash table and the associated counter corresponding to
   the entry that is hit in that table is incremented by the packet
   size. If the counter exceeds a programmed byte threshold in the
   observation interval (this counter threshold would be set to match
   the bandwidth threshold) in the entries that were hit in all of the


Krishnan               Expires August 13, 2013                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft   Optimal Load Distribution over LAG/ECMP  February 2013


   hash tables, a candidate large flow is learnt and programmed in the
   flow table and the counters are reset.

   Additionally, the counters in all of the hash tables must be reset
   every observation interval.

   There may be some false positives due to multiple small flows
   masquerading as a large flow. The number of such false positives is
   reduced by increasing the number of parallel hash tables using
   different hash functions.  There will be a design tradeoff between
   size of the hash tables, the number of hash tables, and the
   probability of a false positive.  More details on this algorithm are
   found in Appendix B.

3.2. Load Re-Balancing Options

   Below are suggested techniques for load re-balancing. Equipment
   vendors should implement all of these techniques and allow the
   operator to choose one or more techniques based on their
   applications.

3.2.1. Alternative Placement of Large Flows

   In the LAG/ECMP group, choose other member component links with least
   average port utilization. Move some large flow(s) from the heavily
   loaded component link to other member component links using a Policy
   Based Routing (PBR) rule in the ingress processing element(s) in the
   routers. The key aspects of this are:

     .  Small flows are not subjected to flow re-ordering.

     .  Only certain large flows are subjected to momentary flow re-
        ordering.

   Note that perfect re-balancing of large flows may not be possible
   since flows arrive and depart at different times.

 3.2.2. Redistributing Small flows

   Some large flows may consume the entire bandwidth of the component
   link(s). In this case, it would be desirable for the small flows to
   not use the congested component link(s). This can be accomplished in
   one of the following ways.

   This method works on some existing router hardware. The idea is to
   prevent, or reduce the probability, that the small flow hashes into
   the congested component link(s).


Krishnan               Expires August 13, 2013                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft   Optimal Load Distribution over LAG/ECMP  February 2013


     .  The LAG/ECMP table is modified to include only non-congested
        component link(s). Small flows hash into this table to be mapped
        to a destination component link. Alternatively, if certain
        component links are heavily loaded, but not congested, the
        output of the hash function can be adjusted to account for large
        flow loading on each of the component links.

     .  Small flows may be subject to momentary packet re-ordering.

     .  The PBR rules for large flows (refer to Section 3.2.1) must
        have strict precedence over the LAG/ECMP table lookup result.

 3.2.3. Component Link Protection Considerations

   If desired, certain component links may be reserved for link
   protection. These reserved component links are not used for any flows
   which are described in Section 3.2. In the case when the component
   link(s) fail, all the flows on the failed component link(s) are moved
   to the reserved component link(s). The mapping table of large flows
   to component link simply replaces the reference pointer from the
   failed component link to the reserved link. Likewise, the LAG/ECMP
   hash table replaces the reference pointer from the failed component
   link to the reserved link.

 3.2.4. Load Re-Balancing Example

   Optimal LAG/ECMP component utilization for the use case in Figure 1
   is depicted below in Figure 2. The large flow rebalancing explained
   in Section 3.2.1 is used. The improved link utilization is as
   follows:

     .  Component link (1) has 3 flows -- 2 small flows and 1 large
        flow -- and the link utilization is normal.

     .  Component link (2) has 4 flows -- 3 small flows and 1 large
        flow -- and the link utilization is normal now.

     .  Component link (3) has 3 flows -- 2 small flows and 1 large
        flow -- and the link utilization is normal now.

   Basically, the use of the mechanisms described in Section 3.2.1
   resulted in a rebalancing of flows where one of the large flows on
   component link (3) which was previously congested was moved to
   component link (2) which was previously under-utilized.



4. Future Work

   There are two areas that would benefit from further standards work:

      1) Development of a data model used to move the large flow
   information from the router to the central management entity.

      2) Development of a data model used to move the large flow re-
   balancing information from the central management entity to the
   router.

6. Security Considerations

   This document does not directly impact the security of the Internet
   infrastructure or its applications. In fact, it could help if there
   is a DOS attack pattern which causes a hash imbalance resulting in
   heavy overloading of large flows to certain LAG/ECMP component
   links.

Appendix A.  Internet Traffic Analysis and Load Balancing Simulation

   Internet traffic [CAIDA] has been analyzed to obtain flow statistics
   such as the number of packets in a flow and the flow duration. The
   five tuples in the packet header (IP addresses, TCP/UDP Ports, and IP

   protocol) are used for flow identification. The analysis indicates
   that < ~2% of the flows take ~30% of total traffic volume while the
   rest of the flows (> ~98%) contributes ~70% [YONG].

   The simulation has shown that given Internet traffic pattern, the
   hash-based technique does not evenly distribute the flows over ECMP
   paths. Some paths may be > 90% loaded while others are < 40% loaded.
   The more ECMP paths exist, the more severe the misbalancing. This
   implies that hash-based distribution can cause some paths to become
   congested while other paths are underutilized [YONG].

   The simulation also shows substantial improvement by using the large
   flow-aware hash-based distribution technique described in this
   document. In using the same simulated traffic, the improved
   rebalancing can achieve < 10% load differences among the paths. It
   proves how large flow-aware hash-based distribution can effectively
   compensate the uneven load balancing caused by hashing and the
   traffic characteristics [YONG].

Appendix B.  Techniques for Automatic Hardware Recognition

B.1 Comparison of Single Hash vs Multiple Hash for Large Flow
   Identification

   The suggested multiple hash technique is scalable in terms of hash
   table storage and flow-table storage.  This is independent of the
   quality of the hash functions.  Scalability is an important
   consideration because there could be millions of flows only a small
   percentage of which are large flows which need to be examined. The
   amount of hash table storage is proportional to the number of large
   flows - the exact number would depend on the use cases and traffic
   characteristics.  The amount of flow-table storage needed is only
   slightly more than the number of large flows; a little extra space is
   needed to accommodate any false positives (small flows which may have
   been incorrectly identified as large flows).

   With a single hash, the hash table storage would be proportionate to
   the total number of flows in order to minimize false positives. The
   amount of flow-table storage needed depends on the total number flows
   and the hash table size.

B.2 Steady state analysis of suggested multiple hash technique

   Objective:

   Determine the probability of short-lived flows masquerading as long-
   lived-flows

   Assumptions:

   The small flows are uniformly distributed over all of the hash
   buckets. Further, assume that the small flows have an identical
   number of packets in the observation interval.

   Notation:

   Number of hash stages - m

   Number of hash buckets per stage - n

   Minimum large flow rate (bytes/sec) - s

   Time interval of examination (sec) - t

   Number of small flows in time interval t - x1

   Number of packets per small flow in time interval t - y

   Average packet size of small flow - z

   Average number of small flows in a hash bucket - x2 (x1/n)

   Minimum number of small flows in the same hash bucket that would lead
   to one small flow being incorrectly identified as a large flow -
   x3Basically, if we have some number of small flows hashing into a
   bucket, only those buckets which hit the minimum bandwidth threshold
   would trigger large flow identification and only the last small flow
   which triggered the event would be incorrectly identified as a large
   flow.

   Using the above notation, it would take at least x3 small flows
   hashing to the same bucket to trigger the minimum bandwidth threshold

Internet-Draft   Optimal Load Distribution over LAG/ECMP  February 2013


   for that bucket, and the flow to which the last packet belongs would
   be incorrectly identified as a large flow.

   x3 = (s*t)/(y*z)

   Let p1 be the probability of such an incorrectly identified large
   flow per hash stage. Let x be a variable denoting the number of small
   flows which hash to the same bucket and can take a value {0, 1, ...,
   x1}. As noted above, the mean value of x is x2.

   p1 = Prob(x >= x3)

   Overall probability with m independent hash stages - p1^m

   Thus, larger tables and more number of tables would lead to a lower
   probability of incorrectly identified large flows.

   An example:

   m = 4, n = 2K, s = 1 MB/sec, t = 1 sec, x1 = 200K, y = 10, z = 1K

   x2 = 200K/2K = 100

   x3 = (1024*1024)/(10*1024) = 102.4

   p1 = Prob (x >= x3) ~= 0.5

   (x2 = 100 small flows fall into one hash bucket on the average)

   Overall probability with m independent hash stages is

   (p1)^m = (0.5)^4 = 0.0625

   Thus, by having 4 stages, the probability of a small flow being
   incorrectly identified as a large flow is reduced from 0.5 to 0.0625.
