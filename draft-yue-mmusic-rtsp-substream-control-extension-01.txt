Internet-Draft    RTSP Extension for Substream Control        March 2012


1.  Introduction

   Single Session Transmission (SST) is recommended for the SVC (
   Scalable Video Codec) video transport [RFC6190] and MVC (Multiview
   Video Codec) video transport [I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-mvc] .  In SST, a
   single RTP session conveys all the related media data, namely all the
   bitstream components.  A bitstream component here is part of a media
   stram that has a common property which could be:
   o  Layer: in SVC media stream; In this case, a bitstream component is
      media data of a specific layer.
   o  View: in MVC media stream; In this case, a bitstream component is
      media data of a specific view.

   In such a SST session,one or several bitstream components together
   may be decodable by themselves and therefore make sense to the
   receiver.  Here these bitstream component(s) combinations are here
   Substream.

   In SVC and MVC RTP sessions, such a Substream is identified by an
   Operation Point.

   There are cases that a client wants to retrieve a specific substream
   in a SST session.  However, in the current RTSP 2.0 protocol, the
   control of the media is on basis of media stream i.e. an RTP session
   when RTP is used as transport protocol.  This prevents a client to
   receive only certain substream(s) of the media.

   This memo extends the RTSP 2.0[I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis] to
   establish a substream playback control framework, which enables a
   client to play a part of a media stream.

   This memo also defines the substream usage for SVC and MVC.

   o  Substream: a part of a media stream containing one or more
      bitstream components, which can be independently decoded.
      Typically a Substream is identified by a single operation point.

4.  Protocol Overview

   The whole framework includes three parts: substream annotation,
   capability negotiation and substream playback control.  This section
   provides an overview of substream control framework.

4.1.  Substream Annotation

   Substream annotation is used to announce all substreams available in
   a media stream, which can be retrieved selectively.  This is done
   through a presentation description, typically using SDP description.

   Substream annotation SHALL signal the substream type and substream id
   for each substream.

   Substrean type is the compound mode of the bitstream components in a
   media stream, e.g.  SVC, MVC, etc.  Here a media stream with SVC
   substream type, means comforming to [RFC6190].  A media stream with
   MVC substream type, means comforming to [I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-mvc].
   More specification of SVC and MVC substream type is defined at

   Section 6.

   Substream id is the identifier for a substream.  The actual
   definition of the substream id is defined by each substream type.

4.2.  Capability Negotiation

   Capability negotiation is used to negotiate support of substream
   control between RTSP client and server.  It makes use of the RTSP
   feature tag mechanism defined in RTSP
   2.0[I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].  A new feature tag (play.substream)
   is defined in Section 5.1 of this document.

   If received a media presentation with substream annotation, a
   substream control capable RTSP client SHALL include play.substream in
   the REQUIRE header of the RTSP SETUP request.  This indicates that
   the client is able to control the playback of the media on substream
   basis.

   A 2xx response implies that the server is capable of substream
   control.  A server MAY refuse the request with a 551 "Option not
   supported" response, with an UNSUPPORT header including
   play.substream.

   The receiving client may try to setup a session without this feature
   later.  This means that the client will not perform substream control
   and will retrieve the media as a whole.

4.3.  Substream Playback Control

   In case the session is setup correctly, the client may control the
   play back on substream basis, including:
   o  start to play/resume a substream
   o  pause a substream.  Note that this means pause the play back of
      the whole session.

4.3.1.  Substream Play/Resume

   After successful set up of an RTSP session, the client may perform
   substream playback control.  The playback of a substream is similar
   with the normal playback of a session, except that the PLAY request
   SHALL contain a "SubstreamCtrl" header to signal the substream(s)
   that the client intends to play.

   The SubstreamCtrl header, as defined in Section 5.2, SHALL contain at
   least the substream type and the substream id of each substream.  In
   the case of aggregate control, the header SHALL further contain
   Request-URIs for each of the the substreams.

Internet-Draft    RTSP Extension for Substream Control        March 2012


   A client SHOULD NOT perform substream play if the server has not
   indicated support of substream control during session setup.

   Upon receiving a PLAY request with a "SubstreamCtrl" header, the
   server SHALL identify the substream(s) according to the substream
   type. substream id and optional Request-URI combination(s) in the
   request, and then provides the indicated substream(s) after sending a
   200 OK response.

   If the server doesn't support substream control, it SHALL respond
   with a 551 "Option not supported" response as defined in RTSP
   2.0[I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].

   If the server supports substream control but the substream type
   indicated in the "SubstreamCtrl" header is not recognized, it SHALL
   respond with a 552 "Substream Type Not Recognizable" response, see
   Section 5.3.1.

   If a requested media is not allowed to be played on substream basis
   as requested, the server SHALL respond with a 553 "Substream Control
   Not Allowed" response, see Section 5.3.2.

   If the requested substream id is not valid, the server SHALL respond
   with a 554 "Substream id not valid", see Section 5.3.3.

4.3.2.  Substream Pause

   The pause operation of a substream is identical to the pause
   operation of a normal RTSP session.  It is not necessary for the
   client to include a "SubstreamCtrl" header in the PAUSE request
   message.  However, if the request includes a "SubstreamCtrl" header,
   it SHALL list all the substreams are currently played.

   Upon receiving a PAUSE request without a SubstreamCtrl header, the
   server SHALL pause the stream(s) according to RTSP
   2.0[I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].

   Upon receiving a PAUSE request with a SubstreamCtrl header, the
   server SHALL check the substream list contained.  If the substream
   list is not identical to the ones that is in the play status, the
   server SHALL respond with a 553 "Substream Control Not Allowed"
   response, see Section 5.3.2.  Otherwise, the server SHALL respond
   with 2xx message and pause the stream(s) properly.


5.  RTSP Extensions

   This section documents the extension to the RTSP 2.0 specification.

Internet-Draft    RTSP Extension for Substream Control        March 2012


   Specifically Section 5.2 specifies the SubstreamCtrl header,
   Section 5.1 specifies the substream control feature tag, Section 5.3
   specifies the status codes extentions for the substream control
   feature.

5.1.  Play.substream Feature Tag

   The following feature-tag is defined in this specification and hereby
   registered.  The change control belongs to the IETF.

   play.substream: Support of substream control operations for media
   playback.  Applies for both clients and servers.

   Notes that this feature is based the play.basic therefore spport of
   this feature inheritly means support of play.basic.

5.2.  Substream Header

   SubstreamCtrl header is used to indicate the substream(s) of media
   stream(s) that the client intends to play.

   SubstreamCtrl header can be used in PLAY and PAUSE request.  Proxies
   shall not modify this header and pass through to the server.

   SubstreamCtrl header contains one or more [stream uri, substream
   type, substream id] triple.  The syntax is:

   SubstreamCtrl = "SubstreamCtrl:"
                   substream-id * (";" sustream-id)
   substream-id  = [stream-uri ","]
                   substream-type "," substream_id
   stream-uri        = RTSP-URI
   substream-type= "SVC" / "MVC" / token


5.3.  Status Code Extension

   This clause defines the status codes extended for the substream
   control feature.  They are:
   o  552 Substream Type Not Recognized
   o  553 Substream Control Not Allowed
   o  554 Substream Id Not Valid

5.3.1.  552 Substream Type Not Recognized

   The server can not recognize one or more substream type(s) in the
   SubstreamCtrl header of the request.

Internet-Draft    RTSP Extension for Substream Control        March 2012


5.3.2.  553 Substream Control Not Allowed

   One or more media streams identified by the Request-URI in the
   request is not allowed for the substream control.

5.3.3.  554 Substream Id Not Valid

   One or more substream id(s) specified in the request are not valid
   for the media identified by the Request-URI.


6.  SVC and MVC Substream Type

6.1.  SVC Substream Type

   This section provides the specification of substream type for SVC
   Stream: Substream Type: "SVC" Substream annotation:

   In SVC, a substream is identical to an operation point, which
   consists of the bitstream components required to be decoded
   independently.

   Operation points are signalled in SDP, by ether of the following two
   parameters :
   o  sprop-operation-point-info: According to [RFC6190], this parameter
      consists of a comma-separated list of operation-point-description
      vectors, including ayer-ID, dependency-ID, temporal_ID,
      quality-ID.  Among them, the value of layer-ID specifies the layer
      identifier of the operation point, which is identical to the
      layer_id that would be indicated (for the same values of
      dependency_id, quality_id, and temporal_id) in the scalability
      information SEI message.
   o  sprop-scalability-info: According to [RFC6190], This parameter is
      used to convey the NAL unit containing the scalability information
      SEI message as specified in Annex G of [H.264].  Within the
      scalability information SEI message, layer information of the SVC
      stream is signalled, including layer_id, dependency_id,
      quality_id, and temporal_id.

   Therefore, substreams in a SVC stream is identified by either
   layer-ID or a [dependency-ID, temporal_ID, quality-ID] combination.

   The syntax of substream_id is:

   substream_id    = layer-id
                     /(dependency-id ","temporal-id "," quality-id)
   layer-id        = "layer_id=" layer_id_value
   layer_id_value  = 1*4DIGIT                              ;0~2047
   dependency-id   = "dependency_id=" dependency_id_value
   dependency_id_value = DIGIT                             ;0~7
   temporal-id     = "temporal_id="  temporal_id_value
   temporal_id_value = DIGIT                               ;0~7
   quality-id              = "quality_id=" quality_id_value
   quality_id_value = 1*2DIGIT                             ;0~15
   DIGIT           =  %x30-39              ;any US-ASCII digit "0".."9"


   An example of Substream header is:

   SubstreamCtrl: rtsp://example.com/svc.mp4, SVC, lay-id=1

6.2.  MVC Substream Type

   This section provides the specification of substream type for SVC
   Stream: Substream Type: "SVC" Substream annotation: Annocation of MVC
   substreams is specified in [I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-mvc].

   editor notes: pending on the complement of
   [I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-mvc].

   Substream_id:

   For the MVC case, the syntax of substream_id is:

   editor's notes: pending on the complement of mvc-operation-point-id


7.  Examples

   The following takes substream control of a SVC stream as an example.
   Step 1: Client C requests a presentation from media server S. The
   media is a video encoded by SVC and transported by SST.

8.  Security Considerations

   Considerations outlined in RTSP 2.0 [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis]
   apply here as well.  It is believed that no special security risk is
   led by this document.


9.  IANA Considerations

   Registration is requested for the newly defined RTSP feature tag
   extension, RTSP header extensions and RTSP status code extensions,
   according to the instructions in section 22 of the base specification
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].

   This section also sets up a registry for substream type that should
   be maintained by IANA.

9.1.  RTSP Feature-tag Extensions

   The following feature-tag is defined in this specification and hereby
   registered according to the section 22.1.2 of the base specification
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].  The change control belongs to the
   IETF.

   o  Feature tag: Play.substream
   o  Description: Support of control the media playback on substream
      basis.  Applies for clients, servers and proxies.
   o  Contact person: Peiyu YUE

9.2.  RTSP Header Extensions

   The following RTSP header is defined in this specification and hereby
   registered according to section 22.4.2 of the base specification
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].  The change control belongs to the
   IETF.

   o  The name of the header: SubstreamCtrl
   o  Description: SubstreamCtrl is used to indicate the substreams RTSP
      client wants to control(i.e. play or pause).
   o  The syntax of the header: as described in Section 5.2.
   o  Where to use: as described in Section 5.2.
   o  Handle by proxy: default.

9.3.  RTSP Status Code Extension

   The following RTSP status codes are in defined this specification and
   hereby registered according to section 22.3.2 of the base
   specification [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].  The change control
   belongs to the IETF.

   o  Request number: 552

9.4.  Hold of Substream Type Registration

9.4.1.  Guidance of Substream Type Registration

   IANA should take the responsibility for the registration of the
   substream type.  A new substream type MUST be registered through an
   IETF Standards Action.  A specification for a new substream type MUST
   consist of the following items:
   o  A substream type;
   o  A description of the substream type;
   o  A substream id definition

9.4.2.  Registration of Substream Types

   This specification registers two substream types: SVC and MVC:
