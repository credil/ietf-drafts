Internet-Draft             TLS Recommendations            September 2013


1.  Introduction

   Over the last few years there have been several major attacks on TLS
   [RFC5246], including attacks on its most commonly used ciphers and
   modes of operation.  Details are given in Section 2, but suffice it
   to say that both AES-CBC and RC4, which together make up for most
   current usage, have been seriously attacked in the context of TLS.

   Given these issues, there is need for IETF guidance on how TLS can be
   used securely.  Unlike most IETF documents, this is guidance for
   deployers, as well as for implementers.  In fact the recommendations
   below call for the use of widely implemented algorithms, which are
   not seeing widespread use today.

   Rather than standardizing new mechanisms in TLS, our goal is to
   recommend a few already-specified mechanisms and cipher suites, and
   to encourage the industry to use them in order to improve the overall
   security of TLS-protected network traffic.  When picking these
   mechanisms, we consider their security, their technical maturity and
   interoperability, as well as their prevalence at the time of writing.

   This recommendation applies to both TLS and DTLS.  TLS 1.3, when it
   is standardized and deployed in the field, should resolve the current
   vulnerabilities while providing significantly better functionality,
   and will very likely obsolete the current document.

   Our knowledge about the strength of various algorithms and feasible
   attacks can change quickly, and experience shows that a crypto BCP is
   a point-in-time statement more than other BCPs.  Readers are advised
   to seek out any errata or udpates that apply to this document.

2.  Attacks on TLS

   This section lists the attacks that motivated the current
   recommendations.  This is not intended to be an extensive survey of
   TLS's security.

   While there are widely deployed mitigations for some of the attacks



Sheffer & Holz           Expires March 24, 2014                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             TLS Recommendations            September 2013


   listed below, we believe that their root causes necessitate a more
   systemic solution.

2.1.  BEAST

   The BEAST attack [BEAST] uses issues with the TLS 1.0 implementation
   of CBC (that is, predictable IV) to decrypt parts of a packet, and
   specifically shows how this can be used to decrypt HTTP cookies when
   run over TLS.

2.2.  Lucky Thirteen

   A consequence of the MAC-then-encrypt design in all current versions
   of TLS is the existence of padding oracle attacks [Padding-Oracle].
   A recent incarnation of these attacks is the Lucky Thirteen attack
   [CBC-Attack], a timing side-channel attack that allows the attacker
   to decrypt arbitrary ciphertext.

2.3.  Attacks on RC4

   The RC4 algorithm [RC4] has been used with TLS (and previously, SSL)
   for many years.  Attacks have also been known for a long time, e.g.
   [RC4-Attack-FMS].  But recent attacks ([RC4-Attack],
   [RC4-Attack-AlF]) have weakened this algorithm even more.  See
   [I-D.popov-tls-prohibiting-rc4] for more details.

2.4.  Compression Attacks: CRIME and BREACH

   The CRIME attack [CRIME] allows an active attacker to decrypt
   cyphertext (specifically, cookies) when TLS is used with protocol-
   level compression.

   The BREACH attack [BREACH] makes similar use of HAdded TTP-level
   compression, which is much more prevalent than compression at the TLS
   level, to decrypt secret data passed in the HTTP response.

   The former attack can be mitigated by disabling TLS compression, as
   recommended below.  We are not aware of mitigations at the protocol
   level to the latter attack, and so application-level mitigations are
   needed (see [BREACH]).  For example, implementations of HTTP that use
   CSRF tokens will need to randomize them even when the recommendations
   of the current document are adopted.


3.  Selection Criteria

   Given the above attacks, we are proposing that deployers opt for a
   specific cipher suite when negotiating TLS.  We have used the

Internet-Draft             TLS Recommendations            September 2013


   following criteria when framing our recommendations:

   o  The cipher suite must be secure in default use, and should not
      require any additional security measures beyond those defined in
      the standard.
   o  The cipher suite must be widely implemented, i.e. available in a
      large percentage of popular cryptographic libraries.
   o  The cipher suite must have undergone a significant amount of
      analysis, and the algorithm and mode of operation must both be
      standardized by relevant organizations.
   o  We prefer cipher suites that provide client-side privacy and
      perfect forward secrecy, i.e. those that use ephemeral Diffie-
      Hellman.  See Section 6.2 for more details.
   o  As currently specified and implemented, elliptic curve groups are
      preferable over modular DH groups: they are easier and safer to
      use within TLS.
   o  When there are multiple key sizes available, we have chosen the
      current industry standard, 128 bits of strength.  Of course
      deployers are free to opt for a stronger cipher suite.


4.  Recommendations

   Following are recommendations for people implementing and deploying
   client and server-side TLS.

4.1.  Summary

   Based on the criteria above, we recommend using as a preferred cipher
   suite the following:

   o  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 [RFC5829]

   It is noted that the above cipher suite is an authenticated
   encryption (AEAD) algorithm [RFC5116], and therefore requires the use
   of TLS 1.2.

   We recommend using 2048-bit server certificates, with a SHA-256
   fingerprint.  See [CAB-Baseline] for more details.

   [RFC4492] allows clients and servers to negotiate ECDH parameters
   (curves).  We recommend that clients and servers prefer verifiably
   random curves (specifically Brainpool P-256, brainpoolp256r1
   [I-D.merkle-tls-brainpool]), and fall back to the commonly used NIST
   P-256 (secp256r1) [RFC4492].  In addition, clients should send an
   ec_point_formats extension with a single element, "uncompressed".

   We recommend to always disable TLS-level compression ([RFC5246], Sec.



Sheffer & Holz           Expires March 24, 2014                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             TLS Recommendations            September 2013


   6.2.2).

   Finally, we recommend that clients disable fallback to SSLv3 (see
   Section 4.3).

4.2.  Cipher Suite Negotiation Details

   We recommend that clients include the above cipher suite as the first
   proposal to any server, unless they have prior knowledge that the
   server cannot respond to a TLS 1.2 client_hello message.

   We recommend that servers prefer this cipher suite (or a similar but
   stronger one) whenever it is proposed, even if it is not the first
   proposal.

   Both clients and servers should include the "Supported Elliptic
   Curves" extension [RFC4492].

   Clients are of course free to offer stronger cipher suites, e.g.
   using AES-256; when they do, the server should prefer the stronger
   cipher suite unless there are reasons (e.g. performance) to choose
   otherwise.

   Note that other profiles of TLS 1.2 exist that use different cipher
   suites.  For example, [RFC6460] defines a profile that uses the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 cipher suites.

   This document is not an application profile standard, in the sense of
   Sec. 9 of [RFC5246].  As a result, clients and servers are still
   required to support the TLS mandatory cipher suite,
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA.

4.3.  Downgrade Attacks

   Some client implementations revert to SSLv3 if the server rejected
   higher versions of SSL/TLS.  This fallback can be forced by a MITM
   attacker.  Moreover, IP scans [[reference?]] show that SSLv3-only
   servers amount to about 3% of the current server population.  As a
   result, we recommend that by default, clients should avoid falling
   back to SSLv3.

4.4.  Alternatives

   Elliptic Curves Cryptography is not universally deployed for several
   reasons, including its complexity compared to modular arithmetic and
   longstanding IPR concerns.  On the other hand, there are two related
   issues hindering effective use of modular Diffie-Hellman cipher



Sheffer & Holz           Expires March 24, 2014                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             TLS Recommendations            September 2013


   suites in TLS:

   o  There are no protocol mechanisms to negotiate the DH groups or
      parameter lengths supported by client and server.
   o  There are widely deployed client implementations that reject
      received DH parameters, if they are longer than 1024 bits.

   We note that with DHE and ECDHE cipher suites, the TLS master key
   only depends on the Diffie Hellman parameters and not on the strength
   the the RSA certificate; moreover, 1024 bits DH parameters are
   generally considered insufficient at this time.

   Because of the above, we recommend using (in priority order):

   1.  Elliptic Curve DHE with negotiated parameters, as described in
       Section 4.1.
   2.  TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 [RFC5288], with 2048-bit
       Diffie-Hellman parameters.
   3.  The same cipher suite, with 1024-bit parameters.

   With modular ephemeral DH, deployers should carefully evaluate
   interoperability vs. security considerations when configuring their
   TLS endpoints.


5.  Implementation Status

   Since this document does not propose a new protocol or a new cipher
   suite, we do not provide a full implementation status, as per
   [RFC6982].  However it is useful to list some known existing
   implementations of the recommended cipher suite(s).

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  AES-GCM

   Please refer to [RFC5246], Sec. 11 for general security
   considerations when using TLS 1.2, and to [RFC5288], Sec. 6 for
   security considerations that apply specifically to AES-GCM when used
   with TLS.

6.2.  Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)

   PFS is a defense against an attacker who records encrypted
   conversations where the session keys are only encrypted with the
   communicating parties' long-term keys.  Should the attacker be able
   to obtain these long-term keys at some point later in the future, he
   will be able to decrypt the session keys and thus the entire
   conversation.  In the context of TLS and DTLS, such compromise of
   long-term keys is not entirely implausible.  It can happen, for
   example, due to:

   o  A client or server being attacked by some other attack vector, and
      the private key retrieved.
   o  A long-term key retrieved from a device that has been sold or
      otherwise decommissioned without prior wiping.
   o  A long-term key used on a device as a default key [Heninger2012].
   o  A key generated by a Trusted Third Party like a CA, and later
      retrieved from it either by extortion or compromise
      [Soghoian2011].
   o  A cryptographic break-through, or the use of asymmetric keys with
      insufficient length [Kleinjung2010].

   PFS ensures in such cases that the session keys cannot be determined
   even by an attacker who obtains the long-term keys some time after
   the conversation.  It also protects against an attacker who is in
   possession of the long-term keys, but remains passive during the
   conversation.

   PFS is generally achieved by using the Diffie-Hellman scheme to
   derive session keys.  The Diffie-Hellman scheme has both parties
   maintain private secrets and send parameters over the network as

Internet-Draft             TLS Recommendations            September 2013


   modular powers over certain cyclic groups.  The properties of the so-
   called Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) allow to derive the session
   keys without an eavesdropper being able to do so.  There is currently
   no known attack against DLP if sufficiently large parameters are
   chosen.

   Unfortunately, many TLS/DTLS cipher suites were defined that do not
   enable PFS, e.g.  TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256.  We thus advocate
   strict use of PFS-only ciphers.  These are listed in Section
   Section 4.1.

6.3.  Session Resumption

Appendix A.  Appendix: Change Log

   Note to RFC Editor: please remove this section before publication.

A.1.  -01

   o  Clarified our motivation in the introduction.
   o  Added a section justifying the need for PFS.
   o  Added recommendations for RSA and DH parameter lengths.  Moved
      from DHE to ECDHE, with a discussion on whether/when DHE is
      appropriate.
   o  Recommendation to avoid fallback to SSLv3.
   o  Initial information about browser support - more still needed!
   o  More clarity on compression.
   o  Client can offer stronger cipher suites.
   o  Discussion of the regular TLS mandatory cipher suite.

A.2.  -00

   o  Initial version.
