  <t>This draft describes operational procedures aimed at reducing the
  amount of traffic lost during planned maintenances of routers or links,
  involving the shutdown of BGP peering sessions.</t>

</abstract>

<section title="Introduction">

    <t> Routing changes in BGP can be caused by planned, maintenance
    operations. This document discusses operational procedures to be applied in
    order to reduce or eliminate losses of packets during the maintenance.
    These losses come from the transient lack of reachability during the BGP
    convergence following the shutdown of an eBGP peering session between two
    Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBR).</t>

	<t> This document presents procedures for the cases where the
	forwarding plane is impacted by the maintenance, hence when
	the use of Graceful Restart does not apply.</t>


    <t> The procedures described in this document can be applied to reduce or
    avoid packet loss for outbound and inbound traffic flows initially
    forwarded along the peering link to be shut down.  These procedures
    trigger, in both involved ASes, rerouting to the alternate path, while
    allowing routers to keep using old paths until alternate ones are learned, installed
    in the RIB and in the FIB.
    This ensures that routers always have a valid route available during the
    convergence process.</t>


    <t> The goal of the document is to meet the requirements described in <xref
    target="REQS"/> at best, without changing the BGP protocol.</t>

	<t> Still, it explains why reserving a community value for the
	purpose of BGP session graceful shutdown would reduce the
	management overhead bound with the solution. It would also
	allow vendors to provide an automatic graceful shutdown
	mechanism that does not require any router reconfiguration at
	maintenance time. </t>

	 <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
	 "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
	 and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
	 described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>



</section>

<section title = "Terminology">

	<t> g-shut initiator: a router on which the session shutdown
	is performed for the maintenance. </t>

	<t> g-shut neighbor: a router that peers with the g-shut
	initiator via (one of) the session(s) to be shut down.</t>

	<t> Initiator AS: the Autonomous System of the g-shut initiator.</t>

	<t> Neighbor AS: the Autonomous System of the g-shut neighbor.</t> 

	<t> Loss of Connectivity (LoC: the state when a router has
	no path towards an affected prefix.</t>


</section>

<section title="Packet loss upon manual eBGP session shutdown" anchor="sec.loss">

	<t>Packets can be lost during a manual shutdown of an eBGP
	session for two reasons. </t>
			
	<t>First, routers involved in the convergence process can
	transiently lack of paths towards an affected prefix, and drop
	traffic destined to this prefix. This is because alternate
	paths can be hidden by nodes of an AS. This happens when the
	paths are not selected as best by the ASBR that receive them
	on an eBGP session, or by Route Reflectors that do not
	propagate them further in the iBGP topology because they do
	not select them as best. </t>

	<t>Second, within the AS, the FIB of routers can be transiently
	inconsistent during the BGP convergence and packets towards
	affected prefixes can loop and be dropped. Note that these
	loops only happen when ASBR-to-ASBR encapsulation is not used
	within the AS.</t>

	<t>This document only addresses the first reason. </t>

</section>




<section title = "Practices to avoid packet losses" anchor = "sec.practices">

	<t>This section describes means for an ISP to reduce the
	transient loss of packets upon a manual shutdown of a BGP
	session. </t>

	<section title = "Improving availability of alternate paths">
	  
	  <t>All solutions that increase the availability of alternate
	  BGP paths at routers performing packet lookups in BGP tables such as
	  <xref target="BestExternal"/> and <xref target="AddPath"/> help
	  in reducing the LoC bound with manual shutdown of eBGP
	  sessions.</t>

	  <t>One of such solutions increasing diversity in such a way that, at
	  any single step of the convergence process following the
	  eBGP session shutdown, a BGP router does not receive a
	  message withdrawing the only path it currently knows for a
	  given NLRI, allows for a simplified g-shut procedure.</t>

      <t>Note that the LoC for the inbound traffic of the maintained router,
      induced by a lack of alternate path propagation within the iBGP topology
      of a neighboring AS is not under the control of the operator performing
      the maintenance. The part of the procedure aimed at avoiding LoC for
      incoming paths can thus be applied even if no LoC are expected for the
      outgoing paths.</t>

	</section><!--Improving availability of alternate paths-->

    <section title = "Make before break convergence: g-shut" target = "sec.summary">
	  
	  <t>This section describes configurations and actions to
	  be performed to perform a graceful shutdown procedure for eBGP
	  peering links. </t>

      <t>The goal of this procedure is to let the paths being shutdown visible,
      but with a lower LOCAL_PREF value, while alternate paths spread through
      the iBGP topology. Instead of withdrawing the path, routers of an AS will
      keep on using it until they become aware of alternate paths.</t>

      <section title = "eBGP g-shut">
	  
	  <section title = "Pre-configuration" anchor = "sec.summary.config">
	    
        <t> On each ASBR supporting the g-shut procedure, an outbound BGP route policy is
        applied on all iBGP sessions of the ASBR, that:</t>
	    
	    <list style = "symbols" hangIndent="5">

          <t> matches the g-shut community</t>

	      <t> sets the LOCAL_PREF attribute of the paths tagged with the
	      g-shut community to a low value</t>

	      <t> removes the g-shut community from the paths.</t>

	      <t> optionally, adds an AS specific g-shut community on
	      these paths to indicate that these are to be withdrawn
	      soon.  If some ingress ASBRs reset the LOCAL_PREF
	      attribute, this AS specific g-shut community will be
	      used to override other LOCAL_PREF preference changes.</t>

	    </list>

      <t>Note that in the case where an AS is aggregating multiple routes under
      a covering prefix, it is recommended to filter out the g-shut community
      from the resulting aggregate BGP route.  By doing so, the setting of the g-shut
      community on one of the aggregated routes will not let the entire
      aggregate inherit the community. Not doing so would let the entire
      aggregate undergo the g-shut behavior.  </t>

     <list style = "symbols">

       <t> apply an outbound BGP route policy on the maintained eBGP session to
       tag the paths propagated over the session with the g-shut community.
       This will trigger the BGP implementation to re-advertise all active
       routes previously advertised, and tag them with the g-shut community.
       </t>
     
       <t> apply an inbound BGP route policy on the maintained eBGP session to tag the

 <section title = "BGP implementation support for G-Shut">

   <t>A BGP router implementation MAY provide features aimed at
   automating the application of the graceful shutdown procedures
   described above.</t>

   <t>Upon a session shutdown specified as graceful by the

   </t>

   <t>

     <list style = "numbers" hangIndent="5">
     
       <t>On the eBGP side, update all the paths propagated over the corresponding eBGP
       session, tagging the GSHUT community to them. Any subsequent
       update sent to the session being gracefully shut down would be
       tagged with the GSHUT community.
       </t>

       <t>On the iBGP side, lower the LOCAL_PREF value of the paths received over the eBGP
       session being shut down, upon their propagation over iBGP sessions.
       Optionally, also tag these paths with an AS specific g-shut community.
       Note that alternatively, the LOCAL_PREF of the paths received over the
       eBGP session can be lowered on the g-shut initiator itself, instead of
       only when propagating over its iBGP sessions. </t>

       <t>Optionally shut down the session after a configured

       <t>Prevent the GSHUT community from being inherited by a path
       that would aggregate some paths tagged with the GSHUT

       its covered prefixes.</t>

     </list>
   </t>

   <t> A BGP implementation supporting a g-shut feature SHOULD also automatically
   install the BGP policies that are supposed to be configured, as decribed in

					to the in-filter reconfiguration step

				</t>

				<t>One community value, GSHUT-out, could be

				<t>The second community value, GSHUT-in, would
					lead to a local-pref decrease in the

				<t>Of course, ISPs are free to agree upon a

<section title = "Router g-shut">

        <t>In the case of a shutdown of a router, a reconfiguration of the
        outbound BGP route policies of the g-shut initiator SHOULD be performed to
        set a low LOCAL_PREF value for the paths originated by the g-shut
        initiator (e.g, BGP aggregates redistributed from other protocols,
        including static routes).</t>

		<t>This behavior is equivalent to the recommended
		behavior for paths "redistributed" from eBGP sessions
		to iBGP sessions in the case of the shutdown of an
		ASBR. </t>

</section>




    </section>

 </section>

<section title="Forwarding modes and transient forwarding loops during convergence"  anchor="sec.forwarding">

    <t>The g-shut procedure or the solutions improving the availability of
    alternate paths, do not change the fact that BGP convergence and the
    subsequent FIB updates are runned independently on each router of the ASes.
    If the AS applying the solution does not rely on encapsulation to forward
    packets from the Ingress Border Router to the Egress Border Router, then
    transient forwarding loops and consequent packet losses can occur during
    the convergence process.  If zero LoC is required, encapsulation is
    required between ASBRs of the AS.  </t>

</section>




<section title = "Link Up cases">
  
  <t>We identify two potential causes for transient packet losses upon
  an eBGP link up event. The first one is local to the g-no-shut initiator,
  the second one is due to the BGP convergence following the injection of new
  best paths within the iBGP topology. </t>

  <section title = "Unreachability local to the ASBR">
    
    <t>An ASBR that selects as best a path received over a newly
    brought up eBGP session may transiently drop traffic. This can
    typically happen when the nexthop attribute differs from the IP
    address of the eBGP peer, and the receiving ASBR has not yet
    resolved the MAC address associated with the IP address of that
    "third party" nexthop. </t>

    <t>A BGP speaker implementation could avoid such losses by
    ensuring that "third party" nexthops are resolved before
    installing paths using these in the RIB.</t>

    <t>If the link up event corresponds to an eBGP session that is being manually
    brought up, over an already up multi-access link, then the
    operator can ping third party nexthops that are expected to be
    used before actually bringing the session up, or ping directed
    broadcast the subnet IP address of the link. By proceeding like
    this, the MAC addresses associated with these third party nexthops
    will be resolved by the g-no-shut initiator.
    </t>

  </section><!--Unreachability local to the ASBR-->

  <section title = "iBGP convergence">

    <t>Corner cases leading to LoC can occur during an eBGP link up event.</t>

    <t>A typical example for such transient unreachability for a given
    prefix is the following:</t>

    <t> Let's consider 3 route reflectors RR1, RR2, RR3. There is a full mesh
    of iBGP session between them. </t>
	
	<t><list style="empty" hangIndent="5" >

	  <t>1. RR1 is initially advertising the
	  current best path to the members of its iBGP RR
	  full-mesh. It propagated that path within its RR
	  full-mesh. RR2 knows only that path towards the prefix.
	  </t>
	
      <t>2. RR3 receives a new best path orginated by the "g-no-shut"
      initiator, being one of its RR clients. RR3 selects it as best, and
      propagates an UPDATE within its RR full-mesh, i.e., to RR1 and RR2.  </t>
 
	  <t>3. RR1 receives that path, reruns its decision process,
	  and picks this new path as best. As a result, RR1 withdraws
	  its previously announced best-path on the iBGP sessions of its RR full-mesh.
	  </t>
	
	  <t>4. If, for any reason, RR3 processes the withdraw
	  generated in step 3, before processing the update generated
	  in step 2, RR3 transiently suffers from unreachability for
	  the affected prefix. </t>
			
	  </list>
	</t>


	<t> The use of <xref target="BestExternal"/> among the RR of
	the iBGP full-mesh can solve these corner cases by ensuring
	that within an AS, the advertisement of a new route is not
	translated into the withdraw of a former route.</t>

	<t> Indeed, "best-external" ensures that an ASBR does not
	withdraw a previously advertised (eBGP) path when it receives
	an additional, preferred path over an iBGP session. Also,
	"best-intra-cluster" ensures that a RR does not withdraw a
	previously advertised (iBGP) path to its non clients
	(e.g. other RRs in a mesh of RR) when it receives a new,
	preferred path over an iBGP session.</t>

  </section><!--iBGP convergence-->

  

</section><!--Link up cases-->




<section title = "IANA assigned g-shut BGP community">

<t> Applying the g-shut procedure is rendered much easier with the use of a
single g-shut community value which could be used on all eBGP sessions, for
both inbound and outbound signaling.  The community value 0xFFFF0000 has been
assigned by IANA for this purpose. </t>

<t> For Internet routes, a non transitive extended community will be reserved
from the pool defined in <xref target = "EXT_POOL"/>. Using such a community type allows
for not leaking graceful signaling out of the AS boundaries, without the need to explicitly
configure filters to strip the community off upon path propagation.
 </t>



</section><!--IANA-->


<section title = "Security Considerations">

    <t> By providing the g-shut service to a neighboring AS, an ISP provides
    means to this neighbor to lower the LOCAL_PREF value assigned to the paths
    received from this neighbor. </t>

    <t> The neighbor could abuse the technique and do inbound traffic
    engineering by declaring some prefixes as undergoing a maintenance so as to
    switch traffic to another peering link.</t>

    <t>If this behavior is not tolerated by the ISP, it SHOULD monitor the use
    of the g-shut community by this neighbor.</t> 

    <t>ASes using the regular (transitive) g-shut community SHOULD remove the
    community from neighboring ASes that do not support the g-shut procedure.
    Doing so prevents malignant remote ASes from using the community through
    intermediate ASes that do not support the feature, in order to perform
    inbound traffic engineering. ASes using the non-transitive extended
    community do not need to do this as the community is non transitive and
    hence cannot be used by remote ASes.</t>

    so as to force the routers in the neighboring AS to select other
    paths. </t>
    
    <t> The solution only works if the alternate paths are as good as
    the initial ones with respect to the Local-Pref value and the AS
    Path Length value.  In the other cases, increasing the MED value
    will not have an impact on the decision process of the routers in

    <t> The distance to the BGP nexthop corresponding to the
    maintained session can be increased in the IGP so that the old
    paths will be less preferred during the application of the IGP
    distance tie-break rule. However, this solution only works for the
    paths whose alternates are as good as the old paths with respect
    to their Local-Pref value, their AS Path length, and their MED
    value.</t>
    
    <t> Also, this poisoning cannot be applied when nexthop self is
    used as there is no nexthop specific to the maintained session to
    poison in the IGP.</t>
