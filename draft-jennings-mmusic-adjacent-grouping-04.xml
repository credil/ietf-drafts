    <abstract>
      <t>Applications such as multi-screen video conferencing systems or
      advertisement boards often have multiple audio and video streams that
      are organized to be rendered side by side or in a grid. This
      specification uses the RFC 5888 Grouping Framework to define new
      semantics for grouping the media streams to be rendered side by side or
      in a grid and indicating their relative ordering.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>There are many situations where applications create media streams
      that are meant do be rendered adjacent to each other. A common example
      is a multi-screen video conferencing system. Other examples are several
      video monitors placed side by side to display signs, and audio streams
      from a linear array of microphones, or a grid of display for monitoring
      security cameras. The Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref
      target="RFC4566"></xref> allows negotiation of multiple media streams
      but does not have a way to describe the ordering information to indicate
      which media stream is adjacent to which one.</t>

      <t>This specification introduces new grouping semantics, using the SDP
      Grouping Framework defined in <xref target="RFC5888"></xref>, that
      indicate media streams are adjacent, and the adjacency order is defined
      by the order of the entries in the group.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This specification uses all the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC5888"></xref> and will not make sense unless you have read
      <xref target="RFC5888"></xref>. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
      "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
      "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
      interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Adjacent Media Grouping">
      <section title="&quot;ADJ&quot; Grouping Semantics">
        <t>This specification defines new grouping semantics of "ADJ" that
        indicate the media streams in this group are meant to be played or
        displayed adjacently. Furthermore, the order of media streams in the
        group indicates the adjacency order. This only indicates the order the
        device sending the SDP believes is the preferred way to display the
        media described in this SDP. </t>

        <t>N media streams could be in a linear horizontal layout, in which
        case we use a grid size of 1 x N. Alternatively, N media streams could
        be in a linear vertical layout, in which case we use a grid size of N
        x 1. In these configurations, the first stream in the group MUST be
        the one corresponding to the left most and top most output unit,
        respectively. In a more general grid size of N x M, we can group K
        (where K &lt;= N x M) media streams starting from the one
        corresponding to the top-left output unit, and then doing a continuous
        horizontal scanning of the grid row by row (i.e., scanning first the
        top row from left to right, and then the second row from left to
        right, and so on). When we say left most, we mean from the point of
        view of the person looking at the display.</t>

        <t>To indicate the dimensions of the layout grid in an SDP
        description, we define a new session-level attribute. The ABNF syntax
        <xref target="RFC5234"></xref> for the new attribute is as
        follows:</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
  media-grid-dims-line = "a=media-grid-dims:" [gridname] 
                          %20 rows "x" columns CRLF
         
  gridname = token ; token is defined in RFC 4566 
  rows    = %x31-39 *DIGIT
  columns = %x31-39 *DIGIT

  namechar =  token // as defined in 
]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>The parameters 'rows' and 'columns' indicate the number of rows and
        columns for this media grid. They both MUST be an integer larger than
        zero. The gridname indicates a name for this grid. If there are multiple
        media-grid-dims attribute in the SDP, each MUST have a unique
        gridname. </t>

        <t>If the 'media-grid-dims' attribute does not exist in the SDP
        description, then a 1 x N horizontal linear layout MUST be assumed.</t>

        <t>Per <xref target="RFC5888"></xref>, there MAY be more than one
        adjacent media group in a single SDP description.  The 'media-grid-dims'
        attribute MUST come before the group or sssrc-group that it applies
        to. An group or SSRC-group for an ADJ group MUST use the first
        'media-grid-dims' attribute found above it in the SDP. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Grouping for SSRC-Multiplexed RTP Streams">
        <t><xref target="RFC5576"></xref> defines an SDP media-level
        attribute, called 'ssrc-group', for grouping the RTP streams that are
        SSRC multiplexed and carried in the same RTP session. The grouping is
        based on the SSRC identifiers. Since SSRC-multiplexed RTP streams are
        defined in the same "m" line, the 'group' attribute cannot be
        used.</t>

        <t>This section specifies how adjacency is described with
        SSRC-multiplexed streams using the 'ssrc-group' attribute <xref
        target="RFC5576"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The semantics of "ADJ" for the 'ssrc-group' attribute are the same
        as the one defined for the 'group' attribute except that the SSRC
        identifiers are used to designate the adjacency grouping associations:
        a=ssrc-group:ADJ *(SP ssrc-id) <xref target="RFC5576"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The SSRC identifiers for the RTP streams that are carried in the
        same RTP session MUST be unique per <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>.
        However, the SSRC identifiers are not guaranteed to be unique among
        different RTP sessions. Thus, the 'ssrc-group' attribute MUST only be
        used at the media level <xref target="RFC5576"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="SDP Offer/Answer Model Considerations">
        <t>When offering adjacent media grouping using SDP in an Offer/Answer
        model <xref target="RFC3264"></xref>, the following considerations
        apply.</t>

        <t>A node that is receiving an offer from a sender may or may not
        understand line grouping. It is also possible that the node
        understands line grouping but it does not understand the "ADJ"
        semantics. From the viewpoint of the sender of the offer, these cases
        are indistinguishable.</t>

        <t>When a node is offered a session with the "ADJ" grouping semantics
        but it does not support line grouping or the adjacent media grouping
        semantics, as per <xref target="RFC5888"></xref>, the node responds to
        the offer either (1) with an answer that ignores the grouping
        attribute or (2) with a refusal to the request (e.g., 488 Not
        Acceptable Here or 606 Not Acceptable in SIP).</t>

        <t>In the first case, the original sender of the offer must send a new
        offer without any grouping. In the second case, if the sender of the
        offer still wishes to establish the session, it should retry the
        request with an offer without the adjacent media grouping. This
        behavior is specified in <xref target="RFC5888"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The offer contains the sender's suggested layout. The answer MAY
        contain the suggested layout of the streams that the system sending the
        answer will be sending to the system that sent the offer.</t>

    <section title="SDP Examples">
      <t>This section provides SDP examples showing how to use the adjacent
      media grouping.</t>

      <section title="Horizontal Layout">
        <t>A video system with two screens and one audio channels sends a SIP
        offer. The following figure shows a top-down view of the room with the
        three screen system that is sending the SIP offer. Screen A is the
        left most screen for the user in this room but should be displayed as
        the rightmost screen for the user at the far end that will be viewing
        the video.</t>

        <t>There might be other media streams, such as presentation video,
        that are not part of any "ADJ" group.</t>

        <t>As a note to implementors, consider the case where each screen had
        two media flows that were in the same FID group. In this case all the
        media streams are still listed in the ADJ group and the order of two
        streams in the same FID group can be arbitrarily picked as they will
        be displayed on the same device.</t>

            <t>In this specification, we define a framework to group "m" lines
            in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) for different purposes.
            This framework uses the "group" and "mid" SDP attributes, both of
            which are defined in this specification. Additionally, we specify
            how to use the framework for two different purposes: for lip
            synchronization and for receiving a media flow consisting of
            several media streams on different transport addresses. This

          <abstract>
            <t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal
            syntax. Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form
            (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many
            Internet specifications. The current specification documents ABNF.
            It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable
            representational power. The differences between standard BNF and
            ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives,
            order-independence, and value ranges. This specification also
            supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core
            lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet
            specifications. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t>

            <t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) provides mechanisms to
            describe attributes of multimedia sessions and of individual media
            streams (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within
            a multimedia session, but does not provide any mechanism to
            describe individual media sources within a media stream. This
            document defines a mechanism to describe RTP media sources, which
            are identified by their synchronization source (SSRC) identifiers,
            in SDP, to associate attributes with these sources, and to express
            relationships among sources. It also defines several source-level
            attributes that can be used to describe properties of media
            sources. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t>

            <t>This document defines a mechanism by which two entities can
            make use of the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to arrive at a
            common view of a multimedia session between them. In the model,
            one participant offers the other a description of the desired
            session from their perspective, and the other participant answers
            with the desired session from their perspective. This offer/answer
            model is most useful in unicast sessions where information from
            both participants is needed for the complete view of the session.
            The offer/answer model is used by protocols like the Session
            Initiation Protocol (SIP). [STANDARDS TRACK]</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants
            and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been
            defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be
            assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption
            or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such
            quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all
            implementations, their assignment must be administered by a
            central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by
            the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt;
            In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs
            guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be
            assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If
            IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace,
            IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that
            role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in
            formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and
            provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be
            included in documents that place demands on
            IANA.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; This document obsoletes RFC 2434. This
            document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
            Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
            improvements.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport
            protocol. RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions
            suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as
            audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network
            services. RTP does not address resource reservation and does not
            guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services. The data
            transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow
            monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large
            multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and
            identification functionality. RTP and RTCP are designed to be
            independent of the underlying transport and network layers. The
            protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.
            Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which
            it obsoletes. There are no changes in the packet formats on the
            wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the
            protocol is used. The biggest change is an enhancement to the
            scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets
            in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate
            when many participants join a session simultaneously.
