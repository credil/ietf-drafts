        Provisioning IPv4 Configuration Over IPv6 Only Networks
                  draft-rajtar-dhc-v4configuration-00

Abstract

   As IPv6 becomes more widely deployed, some service providers are
   taking the approach of deploying IPv6 only networks, without dual-
   stack functionality for IPv4.  However, access to IPv4 based services
   is still an ongoing requirement and approaches such as IPv4-in-IPv6
   softwire tunnels are being developed to meet this need.

   In order to provision end-user's hosts with the necessary IPv4
   configuration, a number of different mechanisms have been proposed.
   This memo discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each and recommend
   a single approach to use for the basis for future work.

Internet-Draft     Provisioning IPv4 Config Over IPv6      February 2013


1.  Introduction

   A service provider with an IPv6-only core network must also be able
   to provide customers with access to the Internet and other services
   over IPv4.  Softwire based IPv4-in-IPv6 tunneling mechanisms are an
   obvious example of this, such as the ones described in:
   [I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite], [I-D.ietf-softwire-map] and
   [I-D.bfmk-softwire-unified-cpe].

   A general trend here is to distribute NAT functionality and IPv4
   address sharing from the centralized tunnel concentrator to the CPE
   in order to achieve better scalability.  This results in a number of
   configuration parameters needing to be provisioned to the CPE such as
   the external public IPv4 address and a restricted port-range to use
   for NAT.

   In order to configure customer's devices for softwire function, a
   dynamic provisioning mechanism is necessary.  In IPv4 only networks,
   DHCPv4 has often been used to provide configuration, but in an IPv6
   only network, DHCPv4 messages cannot be transported.

   This document compares three different approaches which have been
   proposed for resolving this problem.


2.  Approaches for Configuring IPv4 Parameters

   In order to resolve the problem described above, the following
   approaches for transporting IPv4 configuration parameters have been
   suggested:

   1.  Adapt DHCPv4 format messages to be transported over IPv6 as
       described in [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6].  For brevity, this
       is referred to as DHCPv4o6.

   2.  Extend DHCPv6 with new options for IPv4 configuration, such as
       [I-D.mdt-softwire-map-dhcp-option] describes.

   3.  Use DHCPv6 as above for external IPv4 address and source port
       configuration.  Use DHCPv4 over IPv4 messages within an IPv6
       softwire for configuring additional parameters.  For brevity,
       this is referred to as DHCPv4oSW.

   At the time of writing, working examples of the first two approaches
   have been developed and successfully tested in several different
   operators networks.  The third approach is still only theoretical.

   Each of these approaches are described in more detail underneath.

Internet-Draft     Provisioning IPv4 Config Over IPv6      February 2013


2.1.  DHCPv4o6 Based Provisioning - Functional Overview

   In order to receive IPv4 configuration parameters, IPv4-only clients
   initiate and exchange DHCPv4 messages with the DHCPv4 server.  In
   order adapt this to an IPv6-only network, an existing DHCPv4 client
   implements a 'Client Relay' (CRA) function, which takes DHCPv4
   messages and puts them into UDPv6 and IPv6.

   As the mechanism involves unicast based communications, the IPv6
   address of the server must be provisioned to the client.  A new
   DHCPv6 option has been defined for this purpose.

   The DHCPv4o6 server must either provide an IPv6 interface to the
   client, or an intermediary 'Transport Relay Agent' device can act as
   the gateway between the IPv4 and IPv6 domains.

   The DHCPv4o6 server needs to be extended to support the new
   functionality, such as storing the IPv6 address of DHCPv4o6 clients.

   This approach currently uses functional elements for ingress and
   egress of the IPv6-only transport domain--the CRA on the host and the
   TRA or TSV on the server.  As a result, this approach has sometimes
   been referred to as a tunneling approach.  However, relay agent
   encapsulation is not a tunnel, since it carries only DHCP traffic; it
   would be more accurate to describe it as an encapsulation.

   It is worth noting that there is no technical reason for using relay
   encapsulation for DHCPv4o6; this approach was taken because the
   authors of the draft originally imagined that it might be used to
   provide configuration information for an unmodified DHCPv4 client.
   However, this turns out not to be a viable approach: in order for
   this to work, there would have to be IPv4 routing on the local link
   to which the client is connected.  In that case, there's no need for
   DHCPv4o6.

   Given that this is the case, there is no technical reason why
   DHCPv4o6 can't simply use the IPv6 transport directly, without any
   relay encapsulation.  This would greatly simplify the specification
   and the implementation, and would still address the requirements
   stated in this document.

   This solution is described in detail in
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6].

2.2.  DHCPv6 Based Provisioning - Functional Overview

   In this approach, DHCPv6 would be extended with new DHCPv6 options
   for configuring IPv4 based functions.

Internet-Draft     Provisioning IPv4 Config Over IPv6      February 2013


   An example of this approach is described in
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-map-dhcp-option], where a DHCPv6 message is used to
   convey parameters necessary for IPv4 in IPv6 softwire configuration.

2.3.  DHCPv4oSW Based Provisioning - Functional Overview

   In this approach, the configuration of IPv4 address and source ports
   (if required) is carried out as described in section 2.2 above.
   Additional IPv4 configuration parameters are then provisioned using a
   DHCPv4 messages transported within IPv6 in the softwire in the same
   manner as any other IPv4 based traffic.

   On receipt at the tunnel concentrator (e.g.  MAP Border Router or a
   Lightweight 4over6 lwAFTR), the DHCPv4 message removed from the
   softwire and forwarded to the DHCPv4 server in the same way as any
   other IPv4 packet is handled.

   As the client is already configured with its external IPv4 address
   and source ports, the messages exchanged between the DHCPv4 client
   and server would be strictly DHCPINFORM/DHCPACK messages, for the
   configuration of additional IPv4 parameters.

   For this approach to function, a mechanism for the DHCPv4 client to
   learn the IPv4 address of the DHCPv4 server is needed.  This could be
   done by defining a well-known IPv4 address for the DHCPv4 server,
   implementing a DHCPv4 relay function within the tunnel concentrator
   or other configuration methods.

   From a transport perspective, the key difference between this method
   and DHCPv4o6 (described above) is that here, the DHCPv4 message is
   put into UDPv4 and IPv4 and then put into the IPv6 softwire, instead
   of directly placing the DHCPv4 message into UDPv6 and IPv6.


3.  Comparison of the Three Approaches

   The following section of the document provides the pros and cons of
   the approaches.

3.1.  DHCPv4o6 Based Provisioning

3.1.1.  Pros

   1.  Once implemented, all existing DHCPv4 options will be be
       available with no further ongoing development work necessary.

   2.  IPv4 and IPv6 based provisioning can be separated from each other
       if required, allowing flexibility in network design.

Internet-Draft     Provisioning IPv4 Config Over IPv6      February 2013


   3.  Easy to implement through minor adaptation of existing DHCPv4
       client/server code.

   4.  Simple, in that no additional functional elements are necessary
       except the DHCPv4o6 client and server.  The Transport Relay Agent
       is completely optional.

3.1.2.  Cons

   1.  More complex, in that there are more new functional elements
       within the architecture than are necessary in DHCPv6 based
       provisioning.

   2.  A new DHCPv6 option is necessary in order to provision the IPv6
       address of the DHCPv4 server to the end device.

   3.  DHCPv4 clients needs to be updated to implement the IPv6
       encapsulation and decapsulation function.

   4.  The DHCPv4 server needs to be updated to implement new DHCPv4o6
       functionality.

3.2.  DHCPv6 Based Provisioning

3.2.1.  Pros

   1.  Simpler, in that no additional functional elements are required
       except the DHCPv6 client and server.

   2.  A single protocol is used to deliver configuration information
       for IPv4 and IPv6.

3.2.2.  Cons

   1.  Any required DHCPv4 options must be ported to DHCPv6, which will
       require a large amount of re-development work.  All functional
       elements in the DHCPv6 implementation (clients, servers, relays)
       would need to be updated for each change.

   2.  Means that DHCPv4 'legacy' options, which will be of decreasing
       relevance in the future will remain in DHCPv6 for the lifetime of
       the protocol.

   3.  Each time that a DHCPv4 option is ported to DHCPv6, all clients
       and servers would need to be updated to implement the new option.

   4.  Does not provide an architecture for keeping IPv4 and IPv6
       domains separated.

3.3.  DHCPv4oSW Based Provisioning

3.3.1.  Pros

   1.  Once implemented, all existing DHCPv4 options will be be
       available with no further ongoing development work necessary.

   2.  Uses the existing DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 architectures in order to
       provide IPv4 configuration in an IPv6 only environment.

   3.  DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 based provisioning can be separated from each
       other if required, allowing flexibility in network design.

3.3.2.  Cons

   1.  More complex, in that there are more new functional elements
       within the architecture than are necessary in DHCPv6 based
       provisioning.

   2.  IPv4 over IPv6 softwire approaches which distribute NAT to the
       CPE and allow for IP address sharing (MAP-E & LW4o6) forbid the
       use of reserved TCP/UDP ports (e.g. 0-1024).  Every DHCPv4 client
       sharing the same address needs to have a UDP listener running on
       UDP port 68.  To resolve this would require significant rework to
       either the softwire mechanisms and/or the DHCPv4 client
       implementation.

   3.  From the current specification, DHCPINFORM is not suitable for
       use over a softwire.  Additional work, such as the development of
       'shims' would be necessary

   4.  The current DHCPINFORM specification has a number of unclear
       points, such as those described in
       [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpinform-clarify].  Substantial work would be
       required to resolve this.

   5.  Links the deployment of IPv4 configuration over IPv6 to a
       softwire implementation (e.g. requiring a softwire concentrator
       to act as a DHCPv4 relay).  Whilst softwires are the only
       application for this functionality at the moment, this may not
       always be the case.

   6.  A new mechanism must be defined in order to provide the DHCPv4
       client with the IPv4 address of the DHCPv4 server so that unicast
       DHCPINFORM messages can be sent.

4.  Conclusion

   Whilst all of the approaches described here will require some
   development work in order to realise, it is clear from the above
   analysis that the most sustainable approaches capitalise on existing
   DHCPv4 implementations and wrap these within IPv6.  The main
   rationale for this is that it enables all of DHCPv4's existing
   options to be migrated for use over IPv6 in a single step.

   The alternative would require ongoing development work, re-
   implementing existing DHCPv4 functionality in DHCPv6.  This will
   result in having legacy DHCPv4 options in DHCPv6, which will no
   longer be useful once IPv4 is completely abandoned.

   Of the two methods which support the reuse of existing DHCPv4
   implementations (DHCPv4o6 and DHCPv4oSW), DHCPv4oSW may seem to be
   the simpler of the two solutions.  However, as outlined in section
   3.3.2 above, there are some significant problems with its design and
   implementation that would require substantial development and
   standardisation work to resolve.  Although DHCPv4o6 also requires
   additional development work, the technical barriers for realisation
   are much simpler to resolve.

   Therefore, the DHC working group recommends that DHCPv4o6 is the best
   underlying approach for provisioning IPv4 parameters over an IPv6
   only network.  It further recommends that the modifications described
   in section 2.1 are made to simplify the current DHCPv4o6 draft.
