1.  Introduction

   The IPFIX Information Model, as defined by the IANA IPFIX Information
   Element Registry, provides a rich set of Information Elements for
   description of information about network entities and network traffic
   data, and abstract data types for these Information Elements.  The
   IPFIX Protocol Specification [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol-rfc5101bis], in
   turn, defines a big-endian binary encoding for these abstract data
   types suitable for use with the IPFIX Protocol.

   However, present and future operations and management protocols and
   applications may use textual encodings, and generic framing and
   structure as in JSON or XML.  A definition of canonical textual
   encodings for the IPFIX abstract data types would allow this set of
   Information Elements to be used for such applications, and for these
   applications to interoperate with IPFIX applications at the
   Information Element definition level.

   Note that templating or other mechanisms for data description for
   such applications and protocols are application specific, and
   therefore out of scope for this document: only Information Element
   identification and data value representation are defined here.

2.  Terminology

   Capitalized terms defined in the IPFIX Protocol Specification
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol-rfc5101bis] and the IPFIX Information Model
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-information-model-rfc5102bis] are used in this
   document as defined in those documents.  In addition, this document
   defines the following terminology for its own use:

   Enclosing Context
      Textual representation of IPFIX data values is applied to use the
      IPFIX Information Model within some existing textual format (e.g.
      XML, JSON).  This outer format is referred to as the Enclosing
      Context within this document.  Enclosing Contexts define escaping
      and quoting rules for represented data values.

3.  Identifying Information Elements

   The IPFIX Information Element Registry [iana-ipfix-assignments]
   defines a set of Information Elements and numbered by Information
   Element Identifiers, and named for human-readability.  These
   Information Element Identifiers are meant for use with the IPFIX
   protocol, and have little meaning when applying the IPFIX Information
   Element Registry to textual representations.

   Instead, applications using textual representations of Information
   Elements SHOULD use Information Element names to identify them; see
   Appendix A for examples illustrating this principle.

4.  Data Type Encodings

   [FIXME frontmatter]

   This section uses ABNF [RFC5234], including the Core Rules in
   Appendix B, to describe the format of textual representations of
   IPFIX abstract data types.

4.1.  octetArray

   [FIXME: native hex strings for comparative human readabilty.]

4.2.  unsigned*

   First, in the special case that the unsigned Information Element has
   identifier semantics, and refers to a set of codepoints, either in an
   external registry, a sub-registry, or directly in the description of
   the Information Element, then the name or short description for that
   codepoint MAY be used to improve readability.

Internet-Draft              IPFIX Text Types                    May 2013


   If the Enclosing Context defines a representation for unsigned
   integers, that representation SHOULD be used.

   Otherwise, the values of Information Elements of an unsigned integer
   type may be represented either as unprefixed base-10 (decimal)
   strings, or as base-16 (hexadecimal) strings prefixed by '0x'; in
   ABNF:

   unsigned = 1*DIGIT / '0x' 1*HEXDIG

   Leading zeroes are allowed in either encoding, and do not signify
   base-8 (octal) encoding.

   The encoded value must be in range for the corresponding abstract
   data type or Information Element.  Out of range values should be
   interpreted as clipped to the implicit range for the Information
   Element as defined by the abstract data type, or to the explicit
   range of the Information Element if defined.  Minimum and maximum
   values for abstract data types are shown in Table 1 below.

              +------------+---------+----------------------+
              |       type | minimum |              maximum |
              +------------+---------+----------------------+
              |  unsigned8 |       0 |                  255 |
              | unsigned16 |       0 |                65536 |
              | unsigned32 |       0 |           4294967295 |
              | unsigned64 |       0 | 18446744073709551615 |
              +------------+---------+----------------------+

             Table 1: Ranges for unsigned abstract data types

4.3.  signed*

   If the Enclosing Context defines a representation for signed
   integers, that representation SHOULD be used.

   Otherwise, the values of Information Elements of signed integer types
   should be represented as optionally-prefixed base-10 (decimal)
   strings.  In ABNF:

   sign = "+" / "-"

   signed = [sign] 1*DIGIT

   If the sign is omitted, it is assumed to be positive.  Leading zeroes
   are allowed, and do not signify base-8 (octal) encoding.

   The encoded value must be in range for the corresponding abstract
   data type or Information Element.  Out of range values should be
   interpreted as clipped to the implicit range for the Information
   Element as defined by the abstract data type, or to the explicit
   range of the Information Element if defined.  Minimum and maximum
   values for abstract data types are shown in Table 2 below.

        +----------+----------------------+----------------------+
        |     type |              minimum |              maximum |
        +----------+----------------------+----------------------+
        |  signed8 |                 -128 |                 +127 |
        | signed16 |               -32768 |               +32767 |
        | signed32 |          -2147483648 |          +2147483647 |
        | signed64 | -9223372036854775808 | +9223372036854775807 |
        +----------+----------------------+----------------------+

              Table 2: Ranges for signed abstract data types

4.4.  float*

   If the Enclosing Context defines a representation for floating point
   numbers, that representation SHOULD be used.

   Otherwise, the values of Information Elements of float32 or float64
   types are represented as an optionally sign-prefixed, optionally
   base-10 exponent-suffixed, floating point decimal number.  In ABNF:

   sign = "+" / "-"

   exponent = 'e' 1*3DIGIT

   right-decimal = '.'  0*DIGIT

   mantissa = 1*DIGIT [right-decimal]

   float = [sign] mantissa [exponent]

   The expressed value is ( mantissa * 10 ^ exponent ).  If the sign is
   omitted, it is assumed to be positive.  If the exponent is omitted,
   it is assumed to be zero.  Leading zeroes may appear in the mantissa
   and/or the exponent.

4.5.  boolean

   If the Enclosing Context defines a representation for boolean values,
   that representation SHOULD be used.

Internet-Draft              IPFIX Text Types                    May 2013


   Otherwise, a true boolean value should be represented with the
   literal string 1, and a false boolean value with the literal string
   0.  In ABNF:

   boolean-yes = "1"

   boolean-no = "0"

   boolean = boolean-yes / boolean-no

4.6.  macAddress

   MAC addresses are represented as IEEE 802 MAC-48 addresses,
   hexadecimal bytes, most significant byte first, separated by colons.
   In ABNF:

   macaddress = 2*HEXDIG 5*( ":" 2*HEXDIG )

4.7.  string

   As Information Elements of the string type are simply UTF-8 encoded
   strings, they are represented directly, subject to the escaping and
   encoding rules of the Enclosing Context.  If the Enclosing Context
   cannot natively represent UTF-8 characters, the escaping facility
   provided by the Enclosing Context must be used for non-representable
   characters.  Additionally, strings containing characters reserved in
   the Enclosing Context (e.g.  markup characters, quotes) must be
   escaped or quoted according to the rules of the Enclosing Context.

4.8.  dateTime*

   Timestamp data types are represented as in [RFC3339].

   [FIXME: elaborate, and explain precision rules]

4.9.  ipv4Address

   IPv4 addresses are represented in dotted-quad format, most-
   significant-byte first.  In ABNF:

   ipv4address = 1*3DIGIT 3*( "."  1*3DIGIT )

   [FIXME: elaborate]

4.10.  ipv6Address

   IP version 6 addresses are represented as in section 2.2 of
   [RFC4291], as updated by section 4 of [RFC5952].

Internet-Draft              IPFIX Text Types                    May 2013


   [FIXME: elaborate]

4.11.  basicList, subTemplateList, and subTemplateMultiList

   These abstract data types, defined for IPFIX Structured Data
   [RFC6313], do not represent actual data types; they are instead
   designed to provide a mechanism by which complex structure below the
   template level.  It is assumed that protocols using textual
   Information Element representation will provide their own structure.
   Therefore, Information Elements of these Data Types MUST NOT be used
   in textual representations.

5.  Security Considerations

   [FIXME: content would be nice]

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no considerations for IANA.
