Abstract

   This  document  provides  a  recommended  architecture  and  network
   operation  named  SARP.  SARP  is  based  on  fast  proxies  that
   significantly  reduce  broadcast  domains  and  ARP/ND  broadcast
   transmissions. SARP supports smooth and fast virtual machine (VM)
   mobility without any modification to the VM, while keeping the
   connection up and running efficiently.  SARP is targeted for massive
   scaling data centers with a significant number of VMs using ARP and
   ND protocols.

1. Introduction

1.1. SARP Motivation

   SARP provides operational recommendations that mitigate performance
   degradation due to the data center architecture. SARP can be used in
   large data centers with large amount of VMs where VMs migrate from
   one system to another while keeping their network connections up and
   running. Data center operators are required to allow the VMs to keep
   their IP and MAC identity while migrating between systems. The direct
   outcome of having VMs keep their respective IP and MAC identities is
   that Layer 2 broadcast domains are scaling up and protocols such as
   [ARP] and [ND] cause network performance degradation. SARP addresses
   a scaling problem that is also discussed in [ARMD].



1.2. SARP Overview

   SARP uses FAST proxies that break down the large Layer 2 broadcast
   domains into small segments. The SARP proxies are located at the
   boundaries where the local Layer 2 infrastructure connects to its
   Layer 2 cloud. Figure 1 depicts an example of two remote data centers
   that are managed as a single flat Layer 2 domain. SARP proxies are
   implemented at the edge devices connecting the data center to the
   transport network. The direct outcome is significant reduction of
   broadcast domains and ARP/ND transmissions. The large L2 broadcast
   domains are bounded by the SARP proxies. ARP/ND transmissions are
   reduced due to the limited broadcast domains and the use of ARP/ND
   proxies and caching.

   SARP proxies enable fast migration of a VM between clouds and data
   centers, keeping their connections up and running while the mobile
   VMs retain their IP and MAC addresses.

              Figure 1 SARP Networking Architecture Example.

   SARP distributes the Layer 2 Forwarding Information Base (FIB) from
   the edge devices (functioning as SARP proxies) to the VMs. By doing
   so, it significantly reduces table sizes on the edge devices. The
   source VM maintains the mapping of its destination VMs to the
   destination site/cloud in the ARP table. The destination VM IP is
   translated to the destination MAC address of the SARP proxy at the
   destination site. The SARP proxies only maintain Layer 2 FIB of local
   VMs and remote edge devices.

   SARP proxies can support FAST VM migration and provide minimum
   transition phase. When SARP proxy indicates or is informed of VM
   migration, it can update all its peers and trigger a fast update.

   SARP seamlessly supports Layer 2 network virtualization services over
   the overlay network and significantly reduces their complexity in
   terms of table size and performance. The overlay networks are only
   required to map MAC addresses of the SARP proxies to the correct
   tunnel.

1.3. SARP Deployment Options

   SARP deployment is tightly coupled with the data center architecture.
   SARP  proxies  are  located  at  the  point  where  the  Layer  2
   infrastructure connects to its Layer 2 cloud using overlay networks.
   SARP proxies can be located at the data center edge (As Figure 1
   depicts), data center core, or data center aggregation. SARP can also
   be implemented by the hypervisor (As Figure 2 depicts).

   To simplify the description, we will focus on data centers that are
   managed as a single flat Layer 2 network, where SARP proxies are
   located at the boundary where the data center connects to the
   transport network (as Figure 1 depicts).

3. SARP Description


3.1. Control Plane: ARP/ND

   This section describes the ARP/ND procedure scenarios. In the first
   scenario, VMs share the same site. In the second scenario, the source
   VM is local and the destination VM is located at the remote site.

   In all scenarios, the VMs (source and destination) share the same L2
   broadcast domain.

3.1.1. ARP/ND Request for a Local VM

   When source and destination VMs are located at the same site, the
   Address Resolution process is as described in [ARP]. When the VM
   sends an ARP request to learn the IP to MAC mapping of another local
   VM, it receives a reply from the other local VM with the IP-D to MAC-
   D mapping.

3.1.2. ARP/ND Request for a Remote VM

   When the source and destination VMs are located at different sites,
   the Address Resolution process is as follows.

   In our example, the source VM is located at the west site and the
   destination VM is located at the east site.

Internet-Draft              Informational                   March 2012


   When the source VM sends an ARP/ND request to find out the IP to MAC
   mapping of a remote VM, the ARP request is propagated to the Layer 2
   broadcast domain in all sites, including the east site.

   The destination VM responds to the ARP/ND request and transmits an
   ARP/ND reply having the IP-D to MAC-D mapping.

   The east SARP proxy functions as the proxy ARP of its Local VMs. The
   east SARP proxy modifies the ARP reply message to be IP-D to MAC-E
   and forwards the modified ARP reply message to all the SARP proxies.

   The West SARP Proxy forwards the modified ARP reply message to the
   source VM.

   The west SARP proxy can also functions as an ARP cache of the Remote
   VMs. By doing so, it significantly reduces the volume of the ARP/ND
   transmission over the network.

3.2. Data Plane: Packet Transmission

3.2.1. Local Packet Transmission

   When a VM transmits packets to a destination VM that is located at
   the same site, there is no change in the data plane. The packets are
   sent from (IP-S, MAC-S) to (IP-D, MAC-D).

3.2.2. Packet Transmission Between Sites

   Packets that are sent between sites traverse the SARP proxy of both
   sites. In our example, all packets sent from the VM located at the
   west site to the destination VM located at the east site traverse the
   west SARP proxy and the east SARP proxy.

   The source VM follows its ARP table and sends packets to (IP-D, MAC-
   E) destination addresses and with (IP-s, MAC-S) as the source
   addresses.

   The west SARP proxy replaces the packet source address to its own
   source address (MAC-W), keeps the destination address to be (MAC-E),
   and forwards the packet to the east proxy SARP.

   When the east proxy SARP receives the packet, it replaces the
   destination MAC address to be (MAC-D) based on the packet destination
   IP (i.e., IP-D), but it does not change the source MAC addresses.

3.3. VM Local Migration

   When a VM migrates locally within its site, the SARP protocol is not
   required to perform any action. VM migration is resolved entirely by
   the Layer 2 mechanisms.

3.4. VM Migration from One Site to Another

   VMs migration from one site to another is done seamlessly, without
   any changes to the VMs addressing at any level while keeping VMs
   connections up and running.

   In our example, the VM migrates from the west site to the east site.

   VM migration differently affects VMs and networking elements based on
   their respective location:

   -  Origin site (west site)

   -  Destination site (east site)

   -  Other sites

   Origin site:

   The Origin site is the site where the VM started its connections
   before the migration, west site in our example.

   All VMs at the west site that have an ARP entry of IP-D in their ARP
   table have the (IP-D to MAC-D) mapping. ARP mapping is updated by
   aging or by a gratuitous ARP message sent by the new hypervisor of
   the migrating VM and modified by the SARP proxy of the east site with
   (IP-D to MAC-E) mapping. Until ARP tables are updated, the source VMs
   from the west site continue sending packets to MAC-D. Switches at the
   west site are still configured with the old location of MAC-D. This
   can be resolved by MAC table aging or by redirecting the packets to
   the proxy SARP of the west site.

   Destination Site:

   The destination site is the site to which the VM migrated, the east
   site in our example.

   All VMs at the east site that have an ARP entry of IP-D in their ARP
   table have the (IP-D to MAC-W) mapping. ARP mapping is updated by
   aging or by a gratuitous ARP message sent by the hypervisor (IP-D to
   MAC-D) mapping. Until ARP tables are updated, the source VMs from the

Internet-Draft              Informational                   March 2012


   west site continue to send packets to MAC-W. This can be resolved by
   redirecting the packets from the SARP proxy of the east site to the
   migrated VM by updating the destination MAC of the packets to MAC-D.

   Other Sites:

   All VMs at the other sites that have an ARP entry of IP-D in their
   ARP table have the (IP-D to MAC-W) mapping. ARP mapping is updated by
   aging or by a gratuitous ARP message sent by the new hypervisor of
   the migrated VM and modified by the SARP proxy of the east site (IP-D
   to MAC-E) mapping. Until ARP tables are updated, the source VMs from
   the west site continue sending packets to MAC-W. This can be resolved
   by redirecting the packets from the SARP proxy of the west site to
   the SARP proxy of the east site by updating the destination MAC of
   the packets to MAC-E.

3.4.1. ARP/ND Table of Mobile VMs

   The ARP table of the mobile VMs migrating from the west site to the
   east site includes the following types of VMs:

   -  Origin site (west site)

   -  Destination site (east site)

   -  Other Sites inhabitants

   The IP to MAC mapping of VMs located at the other sites is unaffected
   by the migration.

   The IP to MAC mapping of VMs located at east site can be kept with no
   change until the ARP aging time since they are mapped to MAC-E. All
   traffic from the migrated VM to VMs located at the east site
   traverses the SARP proxy of the east Site. This can be mitigated by
   ARP advertisement sent by the SARP proxy of the east site or by the
   hypervisor.

   IP to MAC mapping of VMs located at west sites can be kept with no
   change until the ARP entries age out. All MAC addresses of the VMs
   located at the west site are unknown at the east site. All unknown
   traffic from the VM is intercepted by the SARP proxy of the east site
   and forwarded to the SARP proxy of the west site (just for ARP aging
   time). This can be resolved earlier by the east SARP proxy. Upon
   receiving unknown packets, it can update the migrating VM with the
   new IP to MAC mapping by sending a modified gratuitous ARP with (IP-D
   to MAC-W) mapping.

3.8. SARP Interaction with Overlay networks

   SARP  interaction  with  overlay  networks  providing  L2  network
   virtualization (such as IP, VPLS, OTV, NVGRE and VxLAN) is efficient
   and scalable.

   The mapping of SARP to overlay networks is straightforward. The VM
   does the destination IP to SARP proxy MAC mapping. The mapping of the
   proxy MAC to its correct tunnel is done by the overlay networks. SARP
   significantly scales down the complexity of the overlay networks and
   transport networks by reducing the mapping tables to the number of
   SARP proxies.

4. Security Considerations

   The SARP proxies are located at the boundaries where the local Layer
   2 infrastructure connects to its Layer 2 cloud. The SARP proxies
   interoperate with overlay network protocols that extend the Layer-2
   subnet across data centers or between different systems within a
   datacenter.

   SARP control plane and data plane are traversed by the overlay
   network hence SARP does not expose the network to additional security
   threats.

   SARP proxies may be exposed to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by
   means of ARP/ND message flooding. Thus, the SARP proxies must have
   sufficient resources to support the SARP control plane without making
   the network more vulnerable to DoS than without SARP proxies.

   SARP adds security to the data plane by hiding all the local layer 2
   MAC addresses from potential attacker located at the remote clouds.
   The only MAC addresses that are exposed at remote sites are the MAC
   addresses of the SARP proxies.

5. IANA Considerations
