    	<t>This specification defines procedures to use Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) in IP and IP signalled MPLS environments.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

<t>One application for Seamless Bidrectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-base] is to perform full and partial reachability validations on IP and IP signalled MPLS environments.</t>

<t>This specification defines procedures to use Seamless BFD in IP and IP signalled MPLS environments.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="BFD Target Identifier Type">

<t>BFD target identifier type of value 1 is used for IPv4 addresses and router IDs. This identifier type will cover Seamless BFD in following scenarios:

<list style="symbols">
<t>BFD control packets IPv4 routed.</t>
<t>BFD control packets IPv6 routed.</t>
<t>BFD control packets label switched in IPv4 signaled LSP.</t>
<t>BFD control packets label switched in IPv6 signaled LSP.</t>
</list>

Not all IPv6 aspects are covered by this specification, and details are clarified in <xref target="Res_BFD_Dis" />.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Reserved BFD Discriminators" anchor="Res_BFD_Dis">

<t>With IPv4 based BFD, BFD target identifier type 1 is used. BFD discriminator values corresponding to all or subset of local IPv4 addresses are to be reserved. IPv4 addresses are used as BFD discriminators. Corresponding BFD discriminators MUST be reserved and those BFD discriminators MUST NOT be used for other BFD sessions.</t>

<t>Example:
<list style="symbols">
<t>BFD Target Identifier Type 1: IPv4 address 3.3.2.1 maps to BFD discriminator 0x03030201.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>With IPv6 based BFD, BFD target identifier type 1 is used. BFD discriminator values corresponding to all or subset of local IGP Router IDs are to be reserved. These router IDs are used as BFD discriminators. With OSPFv3, employed 32 bit router IDs are used. Corresponding BFD discriminators MUST be reserved and those BFD discriminators MUST NOT be used for other BFD sessions. ISIS is not included as part of this identifier type, and is outside the scope of this document.</t>

<t>Example:
<list style="symbols">
<t>BFD Target Identifier Type 1: Router-ID 3.3.4.5 maps to BFD discriminator 0x03030405.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>Note that it is acceptable for an IPv4 address and a router-ID to collide, mapping into a same BFD discriminator value. There will not be an issue as long as colliding BFD discriminator value is reserved for the Seamless BFD purpose.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="BFD Target Identifier Table">

<t>With IP identifier type, only locally reserved BFD discriminators and corresponding information are to be in this table. No inter-node communications are needed to exchange BFD discriminator and BFD target identifier mappings.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Full Reachability Validations">

<section title="Initiator Behavior">

<t>Any IP network node can attempt to perform a full reachability validation to any BFD target identifier of type 1 (IPv4 address or router-ID) on other network nodes, as long as destination BFD target identifier is provisioned to use this mechanism. Transmitted BFD control packet by the initiator is to have &quot;your discriminator&quot; corresponding to destination BFD target identifier of type 1.</t>

<t>Initiator is to use following procedures to construct BFD control packets to perform IP full reachability validations on BFD packets that are IP routed:
<list style="symbols"><?rfc subcompact="yes" ?>
<t>MUST set &quot;your discriminator&quot; to target IPv4 address or target router-ID.</t>
<t>If packet is to be explicitly label switched, then explicit label switching packet format described in [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-base] MUST be used. Otherwise IP routing packet format described in [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-base] MUST be used.</t>
</list><?rfc subcompact="no" ?>
</t>

</section>

<section title="Responder Behavior">

<t>To respond to received BFD control packet which was targeted to local BFD target identifier of type 1 (IP ddress or router-ID), response BFD control packet is targeted to IP address taken from received &quot;source IP address&quot;. Responder MUST validate obtained IP address is in valid format (ex: not Martian address). Responder MUST consult local routing table to ensure obtained IP address is reachable.</t>

</section>

    </section>

    <section title="Partial Reachability Validations">

<t>Procedures described in [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-base] applies.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="MPLS Label Verifications" anchor="MPLS_label_verification">

<t>MPLS label verification mechanism is applicable to those IP based BFD which use explicit label switching techniques. However, details of what responder embeds in the lower 23 bits of localhost address, and how initiator determines correctness of label programming is outside the scope of this document.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Provisiong Active IP Sessions" anchor="Provision_IP">

<t>Active IP BFD sessions, single-hop, multi-hop or MPLS can be instantiated on any network node using this mechanism to any IPv4 target addresses and OSPFv3 router IDs using this mechanism. This style of usage is particularly useful only if one side is required to perform full reachability validations (ex: static route, uni-directional tunnel). This style of usage is also particularly useful to perform validations and verifications on just subset of LSPs (ex: inter-AS, injection of partial BFD reachability validation packet on IPv4 RSVP LSP nodes).</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>Same security considerations as <xref target="RFC5880" />, <xref target="RFC5881" />, <xref target="RFC5883" />, <xref target="RFC5884" />, <xref target="RFC5885" /> and [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-base] apply to this document.</t>
