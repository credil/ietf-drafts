    Abstract 

       This draft proposes a Hierarchical Mapping System (HMS) for 
       Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP). HMS uses a hierarchical 
       architecture as well as one-hop DHT (Distributed Hash Tables). HMS 
       composes two levels with the bottom level maintaining EID-to-RLOC 
       mappings in an Autonomous System (AS) and the upper level storing the 
       global EID-prefix-to-AS mappings. The bottom level is organized in 
       one-hop DHT and the upper level propagates EID-prefix-to-AS mappings 
       using a protocol like BGP. HMS builds an efficient and scalable 
       mapping system to provide RLOCs for a given EID.

    Internet-Draft A Hierarchical Mapping System for LISP    December 2012 
        

    1. Introduction 

       The current Internet is facing routing scalability problems and the 
       overloading of IP addresses with the semantics of both "who" and 
       "where" is considered to have deep implications for the routing 
       scalability [RFC 4984]. Separating the address space into identifiers 
       and locators has been proposed to address this problem, such as ILNP 
       (Identifier-Locator Network Protocol) [ILNP], LISP (Locator/ID 
       Separation Protocol) [LISP]. The mapping system is built to supply 
       EID-to-RLOC mappings for Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITRs) and it is a 
       very important component of the locator/identifier separation network. 
       There have been several proposals to address this issue [LISP+ALT] 
       [LISP-DHT] [LISP-TREE] [DHT-MAP].  

       This document proposes a hierarchical mapping system (HMS) which 
       comprises two levels. The bottom level stores the EID-to-RLOC 
       mappings in an AS and the upper level stores the global mappings 
       between EID-prefixes and ASs. Each AS can organize its own mapping 
       system in the bottom level and this draft suggests the use of one hop 
       DHT to implement this. It can guarantee one hop lookup in an AS while 
       the hierarchical architecture or other DHTs cannot. HMS treats each 
       EID as an individual, flat identifier in the bottom level. In the 
       upper level, HMS propagates the EID-prefix-to-AS mapping information 
       using a protocol like BGP. It can aggregate the prefixes in an AS to 
       reduce the number of mapping entries in the upper level. This draft 
       designs the mobility management in HMS and the mobility does not 
       cause mapping updates in the upper level, which makes HMS support 
       host mobility efficiently.  

    2. Definition of items 

       Autonomous System (AS): Within the Internet, an autonomous system is 
         a collection of connected Internet Protocol (IP) routing prefixes 
         under the control of one or more network operators that presents a 
         common, clearly defined routing policy to the Internet. See [RFC 
         1930] for details. 
        
       Endpoint ID (EID): An EID is a 32-bit (for IPv4) or 128-bit (for IPv6) 
         value used in the source and destination address fields of the 
         first (most inner) LISP header of a packet. An EID is allocated to 
         a host from an EID-prefix block associated with the site where the 
         host is located. See [LISP] for details. 
        
       Routing Locator (RLOC): A RLOC is an IPv4 or IPv6 address of an 
         egress tunnel router (ETR). A RLOC is the output of an EID-to-RLOC 
     
     
    Zhang et al.            Expires June 17, 2013                 [Page 3] 
        
    Internet-Draft A Hierarchical Mapping System for LISP    December 2012 
        

         mapping lookup. An EID maps to one or more RLOCs. Typically, RLOCs 
         are numbered based on the connectivity of provider networks. See 
         [LISP] for details. 
        
       EID-prefix: An EID-prefix is a power-of-two block of EIDs which are 
         allocated to a site by an address allocation authority. EID-prefix 
         allocations can be broken up into smaller blocks when an RLOC set 
         is to be associated with the smaller EID-prefix.  
        
       EID-to-RLOC mapping: a binding between an EID or EID-prefix and a 
         RLOC set which can be used to reach the EID. The ITRs can 
         encapsulate packets with the RLOC in the EID-to-RLOC mapping to 
         reach the destination EID. A RLOC set may contain multiple RLOCs to 
         perform multi-homing or traffic engineering. 
        
       Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR): An ITR accepts an IP packet and prepends 
         an "outer" header with RLOCs. It sends a Map-request to the mapping 
         system when it does not have the EID-to-RLOC mapping for the 
         destination EID. 
        
       Egress Tunnel Router (ETR): An ETR accepts packets with the RLOCs as 
         the destination addresses. It strips the outer header and forwards 
         packets based on EIDs. 
        
       xTR: A xTR is a reference to an ITR or ETR when direction of data 
         flow is not part of the context description. xTR refers to the 
         router that is the tunnel endpoint. 
        
       Mapping Server (MS): A Mapping Server is a component introduced in 
         HMS to store the EID-to-RLOC mappings in an AS. It is used in the 
         bottom level of HMS. An AS may need multiple Mapping Servers. This 
         draft organizes Mapping Servers in an AS based on one-hop DHT. 
        
       Destination Mapping Server (DMS): The destination Mapping Server is 
         the successor of the EID that is requested in the one hop DHT. 
        
       Mapping Domain (MD): This document defines the area that a Mapping 
         Server covers as a Mapping Domain, that is, a Mapping Server can 
         supply the EID-to-RLOC mappings in a Mapping Domain. A Mapping 
         Server reports the EID-prefix in its mapping domain to the 
         Forwarder it connects to.

    Internet-Draft A Hierarchical Mapping System for LISP    December 2012 
        

        
       Forwarder (FW): A Forwarder is an agent in an AS. It aggregates the 
         EID-prefixes in an AS, issues mappings between EID-prefixes and 
         Forwarder and reports to the upper level in HMS. When there is one 
         Forwarder in an AS, it actually issues the mapping between EID-
         prefix and AS.  
        
       Resolver (RS): A Resolver is a component in the upper level to store 
         the global mappings between EID-prefixes and Forwarders. There may 
         be multiple Resolvers in an AS. Resolvers run a protocol like BGP 
         to propagate EID-prefix-to-Forwarder mappings. Each Resolver stores 
         the global mappings. 
        
       EID-prefix-to-Forwarder mapping: A binding between EID-prefix and the 
         Forwarder which is in the same AS as the EID-prefix. EID-prefix-to-
         Forwarder mapping is issued by the Forwarder. 
        
       EID-prefix-to-AS mapping: When there is one Forwarder in an AS, the 
         EID-prefix-to-Forwarder mapping actually is EID-prefix-to-AS 
         mapping. It is the binding between the EID-prefix and the AS which 
         announces the EID-prefix. 
        

    3. HMS Overview 

    3.1. The architecture of HMS 

       This draft proposes a Hierarchical Mapping System (HMS). Figure 1 
       shows the architecture of HMS. HMS consists of two levels. The bottom 
       level stores the EID-to-RLOC mappings in an AS and the upper level 
       propagates the EID-prefix-to-Forwarder mappings. HMS introduces three 
       types of components: Mapping Server, Forwarder and Resolver. Mapping 
       Servers locate in the bottom level and maintain EID-to-RLOC mappings 
       in a Mapping Domain. There may be several Mapping Servers in an AS. A 
       Mapping Server reports the prefixes in its Mapping Domain to the 
       Forwarder it connects to. A Forwarder in an AS aggregates the 
       prefixes it receives, issues the EID-prefix-to-Forwarder mappings and 
       reports the mappings to the Resolver it connects to. Resolvers 
       exchange EID-prefix-to-Forwarder mappings using a protocol like BGP. 
       Each Resolver stores the global mappings.  

       In the bottom level, every AS can organize the Mapping Servers in its 
       own manner and this draft suggests the use of one-hop DHT to 
       implement this. One-hop DHT can guarantee one hop lookup. The

       designer of the network can organizes Mapping Servers in an 
       appropriate way as long as they can exchange the mapping information 
       with the upper level. Mapping Servers and Forwarders deal with the 
       local mapping information. 

       In the upper level, Resolvers propagate EID-prefix-to-Forwarder 
       mappings running a protocol like BGP so that each Resolver stores the 
       mappings in the overall network. When there is only one Forwarder in 
       an AS, the Resolvers aggregate EID-prefixes and the EID-prefix-to-
       Forwarder mappings are actually the EID-prefix-to-AS mappings.

    3.2. Mapping registration 

       When an end host attaches to an ITR, the ITR delegates a RLOC to the 
       EID and reports the mapping to the mapping system. Figure 2 shows the 
       registration flow. 

       Step 1: After an ITR delegates a RLOC to an EID, it registers the 
       EID-to-RLOC mapping to its default Mapping Server. 

       Step 2: Besides storing the EID-to-RLOC mapping to its local memory, 
       the Mapping Server hashes the EID and sends the mapping to the 
       destination Mapping Server. 

       Step 3: The Mapping Server aggregates the EIDs in its local memory 
       and reports the EID-prefixes to the Forwarder it connects to. 

       Step 4: The Forwarder aggregates the EID-prefixes it receives, issues 
       the EID-prefix-to-Forwarder mappings and reports the mappings to the 
       Resolver it connects to. 

       Step 5: After receiving the EID-prefix-to-Forwarder mappings, the 
       Resolver advertises the mappings to other Resolvers using a protocol 
       like BGP so that all the Resolvers keep the global EID-prefix-to-
       Forwarder mappings.

    3.3. Mapping resolution 

       When an ITR receive an IP packet, it encapsulates the packet with the 
       RLOCs of the source and destination EID. If an ITR cannot supply a 
       RLOC for the destination EID, it resolves the mapping in the mapping 
       system. Figure 3 depicts the resolution flow. 

       Step 1: When an ITR does not have an EID-to-RLOC mapping for the 
       destination EID, it sends a map-request to the Mapping Server. 

       Step 2: If the source and destination EIDs are in the same Mapping 
       Domain, the Mapping Server can supply a RLOC for the destination EID. 
       If not, the Mapping Server hashes the EID and forwards the map-
       request to the destination Mapping Sever. 

       Step 3: If the source and destination EIDs are in the same AS, the 
       destination Mapping Server can supply a RLOC for the destination EID. 
       If not, the destination Mapping Server forwards the map-request to 
       the Resolver it connects to. 

       Step 4: The Resolver finds the EID-prefix-to-Forwarder mapping and 
       forwards the map-request to the Forwarder. 

       Step 5: The Forwarder sends the map-request to one of the Mapping 
       Servers in the destination AS. 

       Step 6: The Mapping Server hashes the EID and forwards the map-
       request to the destination Mapping Server. 

       Step 7: The destination Mapping Server finds the EID-to-RLOC mapping 
       in its mapping database and sends a map-reply to the ITR.

    4. Mobility 

       The upper level in HMS stores the global mapping information of EID-
       prefix-to-Forwarder, so it is very important to keep the mappings 
       stable in the upper level. The mobility in HMS must not cause lots of 
       mapping updates. 

       When a Mobile Node (MN) moves in one AS, it just updates the EID-to-
       RLOC mapping in the bottom level and does not cause EID-prefix-to-
       Forwarder mapping dynamics in the upper level. 

       When a MN moves across several ASs, the Forwarder in the current AS 
       sends an update message to the Forwarder in the home AS and there is 
       no need to update the upper level. When a map-request arrives at the 
       Forwarder in the home AS, it forwards the map-request to the 
       Forwarder in the current AS and resolves the mapping in the current 
       AS.

    5. Scalability 

       When there is one Forwarder in an AS, the upper level can aggregate 
       the EID-prefixes in an AS. The number of mapping entries can be 
       reduced and the number of aggregated EID-prefixes grows slower than 
       the routing table. 

       The hierarchical architecture prevents the mapping dynamics within an 
       AS from impacting the upper level. It makes the mappings in the upper 
       level rather stable, reducing the error caused by the mapping 
       information asynchronization. The less dynamics of HMS reduces the 
       processing cost and make a less possibility to have scalability 
       problems. 

    6. Multihoming and traffic engineering 

       When an end host or a sub network is multihoming, there is only one 
       mapping entry for the EID or EID-prefix in the mapping system. The 
       mapping system can set different preferences or weights for the 
       mappings to perform traffic engineering.  

    7. Autonomous 

       Although we suggest the use of One-hop DHT in the bottom level, the 
       network designer can design its own mapping system in an AS as long 
       as the bottom level can exchange EID-prefix-to-AS mappings with the 
       upper level. The network can design the mapping system according to 
       its own constraints. 

    8. Security Considerations 

       The EID-to-RLOC mappings are organized in an AS and they do not 
       appear in the transit network. The transit network just knows where 
       to get the EID-to-RLOC mapping does not know the exact information, 
       which makes the mapping information security.  

       The upper level in HMS uses a protocol like BGP to propagate mapping 
       information, so HMS can share the security characteristics of BGP. 

        

    9. IANA Considerations 

       This document makes no request of the IANA.
