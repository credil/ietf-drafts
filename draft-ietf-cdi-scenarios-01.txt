In describing content internetworking as a technology targeted for
use in production networks, it is useful to provide examples of the
sequence of events that may occur when two content networks decide
to interconnect.  The scenarios presented here seek to provide some
concrete examples of what content internetworking is, and also to
provide a basis for evaluating content internetworking proposals.
