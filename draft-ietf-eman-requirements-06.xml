      <t>This document defines requirements for standards 
      specifications for energy management. The requirements defined
      in this document concern monitoring functions as well as 
      control functions. In detail, the focus of the requirements is
      on the following features:  identification of powered entities, 
      monitoring of their power state, power inlets, power outlets, 
      actual power, power properties, consumed energy, and contained 
      batteries.  Further requirements are included to enable control 
      of powered entities' power supply and power state.  This 
      document does not specify the features that must be implemented
      by compliant implementations but rather features that must be 
      supported by standards for energy management.</t>

    <!-- Introduction =========================================== -->
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>With rising energy cost and with an increasing awareness of 
      the ecological impact of running IT equipment, energy
      management is becoming an additional basic requirement for 
      network devices and associated network management systems.</t>

      <t>This document defines requirements for standards 
      specifications for energy management, both monitoring 
      functions and control functions. In detail, the requirements
      listed are focused on the following features: identification 
      of powered entities, monitoring of their power state, power 
      inlets, power outlets, actual power, power properties, 
      consumed energy, and contained batteries. Further included is 
      control of powered entities' power supply and power state.</t>
      
      <t>The main subject of energy management is powered entities 
      that consume electric energy. Powered entities include devices 
      that have an IP address and can be addressed directly, such as 
      hosts, routers, and middleboxes, as well as devices indirectly 
      connected to an IP network, for which a proxy with an IP 
      address provides a management interface, for example, devices 
      in building infrastructure using non-IP protocols.</t>
      
      <t>These requirements concern 
      the standards specification process and not the implementation
      of specified standards. All requirements in this document must
      be reflected by standards specifications to be developed. 
      However, which of the features specified by these standards 
      will be mandatory, recommended, or optional for compliant 
      implementations is to be defined by standards track 
      document(s) and not in this document.</t>

      <t><xref target="goals"/> elaborates a set of general needs 
      for energy management. Requirements
      for an energy management standard are specified in Sections 
      <xref format="counter" target="identity"/> to
      <xref format="counter" target="controlother"/>.</t>
      
      <t>Sections <xref format="counter" target="identity"/> to
      <xref format="counter" target="control"/> contain  
      conventional requirements specifying information on 
      powered entities  
       and control functions.</t>
      
      <t>Sections <xref format="counter" target="reportonother"/> 
      and <xref format="counter" target="controlother"/> contain 
      requirements specific to energy management.  Due to the nature
      of power supply, some monitoring and control functions are not 
      conducted by interacting with the powered entity of interest, 
      but with other entities, for example, entities upstream in a 
      power distribution tree.</t>

      <section anchor="conventional" 
        title="Conventional requirements for energy management">
        <t>The specification of requirements for an energy 
        management standard starts with <xref target="identity"/> 
        addressing the identification of powered entities and the 
        granularity of reporting of energy-related information. 
        A standard must support unique identification of powered 
        entities, reporting per entire powered device, and reporting 
        energy-related information on individual components of a 
        device or subtended devices.  This is why this draft uses 
        the more general term "powered entity" rather than "powered 
        device"; a powered entity may be a device or a component of 
        a device.</t>

        <t><xref target="properties"/> specifies requirements 
        related to monitoring of powered entities. This includes 
        general (type, context) information and specific information
        on power states, power inlets, power outlets, power, energy, 
        and batteries. Control power state and power supply of 
        powered entities is covered by requirements specified in 
        <xref target="control"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Specific requirements for energy management">

        <t>While the conventional requirements summarized above seem
        to be all that would be needed for energy management, there 
        are significant differences between energy management and 
        most well known network management functions.
        The most significant difference 
        is the need for some devices to report on other
        entities. There are three major reasons for this.
                
<!-- A new framework is necessary. -->

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>For monitoring a particular powered entity it is not 
          always sufficient to communicate with the powered entity 
          only. When the powered entity has no 
          instrumentation for determining power,
          it might still be possible to obtain power values for the
          entity by communication with other entities in its
          power distribution tree. 
          <vspace/>
          A simple example is retrieving power values from
          a power meter at the power line into the powered entity. 
          Common examples are a Power Distribution Unit (PDU) and
          a Power over Ethernet (PoE) switch. Both supply power to 
          other entities at sockets or ports, respectively, and are
          often instrumented to measure power per socket or port.
          </t>
      
          <t>Similar considerations apply to controlling power 
          supply of a powered entity which often needs direct or 
          indirect communications with 
          another entity upstream in the power distribution tree. 
          Again, a PDU and a PoE switch are common examples, if they 
          have the capability to switch on or off power at their 
          sockets or ports, respectively.</t>
      
          <t>Energy management often extends beyond entities with IP
          network interfaces, to non-IP building systems accessed 
          via a gateway.  Requirements in this document do not cover 
          details of these networks, but specify means for opening 
          IP network management towards them.</t>

          <t>For monitoring powered entities, as their number 
          becomes large, it is  sometimes not a scalable approach 
          to communicate directly with all powered entities directly
          from a central energy management system.</t> 
        </list></t>
        
        <t>This specific issue of energy management and a set of 
        further ones are covered by requirements specified in 
        Sections <xref format="counter" target="reportonother"/> and
        <xref format="counter" target="controlother"/>.</t>
        
        <t>The requirements in these sections 
        need a new energy management framework  
        that deals with the specific nature 
        of energy management. 
        The actual standards documents, such as MIB module 
        specifications, address conformance by specifying which 
        feature must, should, or may to be implemented by compliant 
        implementations.
        </t>

    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        
      <t> Terminology to be used by the eman WG is currently 
      discussed in <xref target="I-D.parello-eman-definitions"/>. 
      After final definitions of terms have been agreed, those 
      definitions will be listed here.</t>
   
    </section>
    

    <!-- Objectives ============================================ -->

    <section anchor="goals" 
      title="General Considerations Related to Energy Management">
      <t>The basic objective of energy management is operating 
      sets of devices with minimal energy, while maintaining 
      a certain level of service.  Use cases 
      for energy management can be found in 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-eman-applicability-statement"></xref>. 
      </t>  

      <section anchor="powerstates" title="Power states">
        <t>
        Powered entities can be set to an operational state that 
        results in the lowest energy consumption level that still 
        meets the service level performance objectives.  
        In principle, there are four basic types of power states 
        for a powered entity or for a whole system:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>full power state</t>
          <t>reduced power states (e.g. lower clock rate for 
          processor, lower data rate on a link, etc.)</t>
          <t>sleep state (not functional, but immediately 
          available)</t>
          <t>off state (may require significant time 
          to become operational)</t>
        </list>
        In specific devices, the number of power states and their 
        properties varies considerably. Simple powered 
        entities may just have only the extreme states, full power 
        and off state. Many devices have
        three basic power states: on, off, and sleep. 
        However, more finely grained power states can be implemented 
        with many levels of each power states.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="tradeoffs" 
        title="Saving energy versus maintaining service level agreements">
        <t>While the general objective of energy management is quite 
        clear, the way to attain that goal is often difficult. 
        In many cases there is no way of reducing power consumption 
        without the consequence of a potential performance, service, 
        or capacity degradation. Then a trade-off needs to be dealt 
        with between service level objectives and energy 
        minimization.  In other cases a reduction of energy 
        consumption can easily be achieved while still maintaining 
        sufficient service level performance, for example, by 
        switching powered entities to lower power states when higher
        performance is not needed.</t> 
      </section>

      <section anchor="localglobal" 
               title="Local versus network-wide energy management">
        <t>Many energy saving functions are executed locally by 
        a powered entity; it 
        monitors its usage and dynamically adapts its energy 
        consumption according to the required performance. It may, 
        for example, switch to a sleep state when it is not in use 
        or out of scheduled business hours. 
        An energy management system may
        observe an entity's power 
        state and configure its power saving policies.</t>

        <t>Energy savings can also be achieved with policies 
        implemented by a network management system that controls 
        power states of managed entities.  Information about the 
        energy consumption of powered entities in different power 
        states may be required to set policy. Often this 
        information is acquired best through monitoring.</t>
        
        <t>Both methods, network-wide and local energy management,
        have advantages and disadvantages and often it is desirable 
        to combine them. Central management is often favorable for 
        setting power states of a large number of entities at the 
        same time, for example, at the beginning and end of business
        hours in a building. Local management is often preferable 
        for power saving measures based on local observations, such 
        as high or low load of an entity.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="monitoring" 
               title="Energy monitoring versus energy saving">
        <t>Monitoring energy consumption 
        and power states alone does not reduce the energy
        consumption of a powered entity. In fact, it may increase 
        the power consumption slightly due to 
        monitoring instrumentation that consumes
        energy. Reporting measured quantities
        over the network may also increase energy use, though the 
        acquired information may be an
        essential 
        input to control loops that save 
        energy.</t>

        <t>Monitoring power states and energy consumption 
        can also be required for other purposes 
        including:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>investigating energy saving potential</t>
          <t>evaluating the effectiveness of energy saving policies 
          and measures</t>
          <t>deriving, implementing, and testing power management
          strategies</t>
          <t>accounting for the total power consumption of a powered 
          entity, a network, or a service</t>
          <t>predicting a powered entity's reliability based on 
          power usage</t>
          <t>choosing time of next maintenance cycle for a powered 
          entity</t>
        </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="requirements" 
               title="Overview of energy management requirements">
        <t>The following 
        basic management functions are required: 
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>monitoring power states</t>
          <t>monitoring power (energy consumption rate)</t>
          <t>monitoring (accumulated) energy consumption</t>
          <t>monitoring power properties</t>
          <t>setting power states</t>
          <t>setting and enforcing power saving policies</t>
        </list></t>
      
        <t>Power control is complementary 
        to other energy savings measures 
        such as low power electronics, energy saving protocols 
        , energy-efficient device design 
        (for example, low-power modes for  
        components), and energy-efficient network architectures. 
        Measurement of energy consumption can provide useful
        data for developing these technologies.</t>

    <!-- Requirements related to Identity of entities =========  -->

    <section anchor="identity" 
             title="Identification of Powered Entities">
      <t>Powered entities 
      must be uniquely identified.
      This includes
      entities that are components of managed devices and in case
      that one powered entity reports information on another one, 
      see <xref target="reportonother"/>. For powered entities 
      that control other powered entities it is important to
      identify the powered entities they control, see 
      <xref target="controlother"/>.</t>      
      
      <t> An entity
      may be an entire device or a 
      component of it. Examples of components of interest are 
      a hard drive, a battery, or a line card. 
      It may be required to be able to control individual 
      components to save energy. For example, server blades 
      can be switched off when the overall load is low or line cards
      at switches may be powered down at night.</t>

      <t>Identifiers for devices and components  
      are already defined in standard MIB modules, such as the LLDP 
      MIB module <xref target="IEEE-802.1AB"/> and the LLDP-MED MIB 
      module <xref target="ANSI-TIA-1057"/> for devices and the 
      Entity MIB module <xref target="RFC4133"/> and the Power 
      Ethernet MIB <xref target="RFC3621"/> for components of 
      devices.  Energy management needs means to link 
      energy-related information to	such identifiers.</t>
        
      <t>Instrumentation for measuring energy consumption of a
      device is typically more expensive than instrumentation for
      retrieving its power state.  
      Many devices may provide power state information 
      for all individual components  
      separately, while reporting the energy consumption only for

        <t>A power interface is either an inlet or an outlet.
        A few switch between these two but most never change.</t>
        
        <t>Powered entities have power inlets at which they are 
        supplied with electric power. Most powered entities have a 
        single power inlet, while some have multiple inlets. 
        Different power inlets on a device are often connected to 
        separate power distribution trees. For energy monitoring, 
        it is useful to retrieve information on the number of inlets 
        of a powered entity, the availability of power at inlets 
        and which of them are actually in use.</t>

        supplying other powered entities with electric power. </t>                                         

        <t>For identifying and potentially controlling the source of 
        power received at an inlet, it may be required to identify 
        the power outlet of another powered entity at which the 
        received power is provided. Analogously, for each outlet it 
        is of interest to identify the power inlets that receive the
        power provided at a certain outlet.  Such information is 
        also required for constructing the wiring topology of 
        electrical power distribution to powered entities.</t>

        information for energy management. Static properties

        <t>Obtaining highly accurate values for power and energy may 
        be costly if it requires dedicated metering hardware. 
        Powered entities without the ability to measure their power 
        and energy consumption with high accuracy may just report 
        estimated values, for example based on load monitoring or 
        even just the entity type.</t>
        
        <t>Depending on how power and energy consumption values are 
        obtained, the confidence in the reported value and its 
        accuracy will vary.  Powered entities reporting such values 
        should qualify the confidence in the reported values and 
        quantify the accuracy of measurements. For reporting 
        accuracy, the accuracy classes specified in <xref 
        target="IEC.62053-21">IEC 62053-21</xref> and <xref 
        target="IEC.62053-22">IEC 62053-22</xref> should be 
        considered.</t>

        <t>Further properties of the supplied power are also of 
        interest.  For AC power supply, power attributes beyond the 
        real power to be reported include the apparent power, the 
        reactive power, and the phase angle of the current or the 
        power factor. For both AC and DC power the  power 
        characteristics are also subject of monitoring. Power 
        parameters include the actual voltage, the actual frequency, 
        the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of voltage and current, 
        the impedance of an AC phase or of the DC supply. Power 
        monitoring should be in line with existing standards, such

        typically controlled by automatic functions that act locally
        on the powered entity and manually by users of the powered 
        entity. There is a need to monitor the battery status of 
        these entities by network management systems.</t>
        
        <t>Devices containing batteries can be modeled in two ways. 
        The entire device can be modeled as a single powered entity 
        on which energy-related information is reported or the 
        battery can be modeled as an individual powered entity for 
        which energy-related information is monitored individually
        according to requirements in Sections

        <xref target="energy" format="counter"/>.</t>
        
        <t>Further information on batteries is of interest for

        charging state of the battery, and further static and 
        dynamic battery properties. It is desirable to receive

      <section anchor="timeseries" 
               title="Time series of measured values">
        <t>For some network management tasks, it is required to 
        obtain time series of measured values, such as power, 
        energy, battery charge, etc.</t>
        
        <t>In general these could be obtained in many different 
        ways. It should be avoided that such time series can only be 
        obtained through regular polling by the energy management 
        system.  Means should be provided to either push such values
        from the location where they are available to the management
        system or to have them stored locally for a sufficiently 
        long period of time such that a management system can 
        retrieve full time series.</t>
        
        <t>While there is a common understanding that support for 
        reporting of time series is needed, there is no clear 
        agreement on four issues:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Which quantities should be reported?</t>
          <t>Which time interval type should be used (total, delta, 
          sliding window)?</t>
          <t>Which measurement method should be used (sampled, 
          continuous)?</t>
          <t>Which reporting model should be used (push or pull)?
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>
        
        <t>The most discussed and probably most needed quantities 
        are power and energy.  But a need for others, for example, 
        battery charge can be identified as well.</t>
        
        <t>There are three time interval types under discussion for 
        accumulated quantities such as energy.  They can be reported 
        as total values, accumulated between the last restart of the 
        measurement and a certain timestamp.  Alternatively, they 
        can be reported as delta values between two consecutive 
        timestamps.  Another alternative is reporting values for 
        sliding windows as specified in <xref 
        target="IEC.61850-7-4"/>.</t>
        
        <t>For non-accumulative quantities, such as power, different 
        measurement methods are considered. Such quantities can be 
        reported using values sampled at certain time stamps or 
        alternatively by mean values for these quantities averaged 
        between two (consecutive) time stamps or over a sliding 
        window.</t>
        
        <t>Finally, time series can be reported using different 
        reporting models, particularly push-based or pull-based.  
        Push-based reporting can, for example, be realized by 
        reporting power or energy values using the IPFIX protocol 
        <xref target="RFC5101"/>,<xref target="RFC5102"/>.  SNMP 
        <xref target="RFC3411"/> is an example for a protocol that 
        can be used for realizing pull-based reporting of time 
        series.</t> 
        
        <t>All these issues are not clear at the time this 
        document is written.  If practical experiences with the
        energy management standard to be defined will be available, 
        they may help reducing the large number of choices and
        identifying and specifying commonly shared requirements 
        for reporting time series of energy-related quantities in a
        future revision of this document.</t>

    <!-- Requirements related to Entity Control ================ -->

    <section anchor="control" title="Control of Powered Entities">
      <t>Many powered entities control their power state locally.
      Other powered entities without that capability need interfaces
      for an energy management system to control their power states.
      Even for self-managed powered entities such interfaces may be
      required for configuring local policy parameters and for 
      overruling local policy decisions by global ones.</t>

      <t>Power supply is typically not self-managed by powered 
      entities.  And controlling power supply is typically not 
      conducted as interaction between energy management system and 
      the powered entity itself. It is rather an interaction between
      the management system and an entity providing power at its 
      power outlets.  Similar to power state control, power supply 
      control may be policy driven. Note that shutting down the 
      power supply abruptly may have severe consequences for the 
      powered entity.</t>

      <section toc="exclude" title="Controlling power states">

      powered entities.  This section covers reporting of 
      information only. See <xref target="controlother"/> for 
      requirements on controlling other powered entities.</t>
      
      <t>There are cases where a power supply unit switches power 
      for several powered entities by turning power on or off at a 
      single power outlet or where a power meter measures the 
      accumulated power of several powered entities at a single 
      power line.  Consequently, it should be possible to report 
      that a monitored value does not relate to just a single 
      powered entity, but is an accumulated value for a set of 
      powered entities.  All of these powered entities belonging to
      that set need to be identified.</t>
      
      <t>If a powered entity has information about where
      energy-related information on itself can be retrieved, then it

  <section anchor="standards" title="Existing Standards">
      <t>This section analyzes existing standards for energy consumption and
      power state monitoring. It shows that there are already several standards
      that cover only some part of the requirements listed above, but even all
      together they do not cover all of the requirements for energy 
      management.</t>

      <section title="Existing IETF Standards">
        <t>There are already RFCs available that address a subset of the
        requirements.</t>

    
         <section title="ENTITY MIB">
          <t>The ENTITY-MIB module defined in <xref target="RFC4133"/> was 
          designed to model physical and logical entities of a managed system. 
          A physical entity is an identifiable physical component. A logical entity 
          can use one or more physical entities. From an energy monitoring 
          perspective of a managed system, the ENTITY-MIB modeling framework 
          can be reused and whenever <xref target="RFC4133">RFC 4133</xref> 
          has been implemented. The entPhysicalIndex from entPhysicalTable 
          can be used to identify an entity/component. However, there are use 
          cases of energy monitoring, where the application of the ENTITY-MIB 
          does not seem readily apparent and some of those entities could be 
          beyond the original scope and intent of the ENTITY-MIB.</t>  

          <t>Consider the case of remote devices attached to the network, 
          and the network device could collect the energy measurement and 
          report on behalf of such attached devices. Some of the remote 
          devices such as PoE phones attached to a switch port have been 
          considered in the Power-over-Ethernet MIB module <xref target="RFC3621"/>.  
          However, there are many other devices such as a computer, 
          which draw power from a wall outlet or building HVAC devices which 
          seem to be beyond the original scope of the ENTITY-MIB.</t>  
          
          <t>Yet another example, is smart-PDUs, which can report 
          the energy consumption of the device attached to the power 
          outlet of the PDU. In some cases, the device can be attached 
          to multiple to power outlets. Thus, the energy measured at 
          multiple outlets need to be aggregated to determine the consumption 
          of a single device.  From mapping perspective, between the PDU 
          outlets and the device this is a many-to-one mapping. It is not 
          clear if such a many-to-one mapping is feasible within the 
          ENTITY-MIB framework.</t>
         </section>

        <section title="ENTITY STATE MIB">
          <t><xref target="RFC4268">RFC 4268</xref> defines the ENTITY STATE
          MIB module. Implementations of this module provide information on
          entities including the standby status (hotStandby, coldStandby,
          providingService), the operational status (disabled, enabled,
          testing), the alarm status (underRepair, critical, major, minor,
          warning), and the usage status (idle, active, busy). This
          information is already useful as input for policy decisions and for
          other network management tasks. However, the number of states would 
          cover only a small
          subset of the requirements for power state monitoring and it does
          not provide means for energy consumption monitoring.  
          For associating the information conveyed by the ENTITY STATE MIB to 
          specific components of a device, 
          the ENTITY STATE MIB module makes use of the means provided by the 
          <xref target="RFC4133">ENTITY MIB module</xref>. Particularly, it 
          uses the entPhysicalIndex for identifying entities.</t>
          <t>The standby status provided by the ENTITY STATE MIB module is 
          related to power states required for energy management, but the
          number of states is too restricted for meeting all energy management 
          requirements.
          For energy management several more power states are required, 
          such as different sleep and operational states as defined by 
          the 
          <xref target="ACPI.R30b">Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)</xref>
          or the
          <xref target="DMTF.DSP1027">DMTF Power State Management Profile</xref>.</t>
          
        </section>

        <section title="ENTITY SENSOR MIB">
          <t><xref target="RFC3433">RFC 3433</xref> defines the ENTITY SENSOR
          MIB module. Implementations of this module offer a generic way to
          provide data collected by a sensor. A sensor could be an energy
          consumption meter delivering measured values in Watt. This could be
          used for reporting current power of an entity and its components. 
          Furthermore, the ENTITY SENSOR MIB can be used to retrieve the 
          accuracy of the used power meter.</t>

          <t>Similar to the ENTITY STATE MIB module, the ENTITY SENSOR MIB
          module makes use of the means provided by the <xref
          target="RFC4133">ENTITY MIB module</xref> for relating provided
          information to components of a device. </t>
          
          <t>However, there is no unit available for reporting energy
          quantities, such as, for example, watt seconds or kilowatt hours,
          and the ENTITY SENSOR MIB module does not support reporting 
          accuracy of measurements according to the IEC / ANSI accuracy
          classes, which are commonly in use for electric power and energy
          measurements. The ENTITY SENSOR MIB modules only provides a 
          coarse-grained method for indicating accuracy by stating the 
          number of correct digits of fixed point values.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="UPS MIB">
          <t><xref target="RFC1628">RFC 1628</xref> defines the UPS MIB
          module. Implementations of this module provide information on the
          current real power of entities attached to an uninterruptible power
          supply (UPS) device. This application would require identifying
          which entity is attached to which port of the UPS device.</t>
          
          <t>UPS MIB provides information on the state of the UPS network.  
          The MIB module contains several variables that are used to identify 
          the UPS entity (name, model,..), the battery state, to characterize 
          the input load to the UPS, to characterize the output from 
          the UPS, to indicate the various alarm events.  The 
          measurements of power in UPS MIB are in Volts, Amperes and Watts.
          The units of power measurement are RMS volts, RMS Amperes and 
          are not based on Entity-Sensor MIB <xref target="RFC3433"/>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="POWER ETHERNET MIB">
          <t>Similar to the UPS MIB, implementations of the POWER ETHERNET MIB
          module defined in <xref target="RFC3621">RFC3621</xref> provide
          information on the current energy consumption of the entities that 
          receive Power over Ethernet (PoE). This information can be retrieved 
          at the power sourcing equipment. Analogous to the UPS MIB, it is 
          required to identify which entities are attached to which port 
          of the power sourcing equipment.</t>
          
          <t>The  POWER ETHERNET MIB does not report power and energy 
          consumption on a per port basis, but can report aggregated values 
          for groups of ports. It does not use objects of the ENTITY MIB 
          module for identifying entities, although this module existed 
          already when the POWER ETHERNET MIB modules was standardized.</t>

        <section title="LLDP MED MIB">
          <t>The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) defined in IEEE
          802.1ab is a data link layer protocol used by network devices 
          for advertising of their identities, capabilities, and 
          interconnections on a LAN network.  
              
          The Media Endpoint Discovery (MED) (ANSI-TIA-1057) is an enhancement 
          of LLDP known as LLDP-MED. The LLDP-MED enhancements specifically 
          address voice applications.  LLDP-MED covers 6 basic areas: 
          capabilities discovery, LAN speed and duplex discovery, 
          network policy discovery, location identification discovery, 
          inventory discovery, and power discovery.</t>

        <t></t>

        <section title="DMTF">
          <t>The DMTF has defined a <xref target="DMTF.DSP1027">power state 
          management profile</xref> that is targeted at computer systems. 
          It is based on the DMTF's Common Information Model (CIM) and it
          is rather an entity profile than an actual energy consumption 
          monitoring standard.</t>

          <t>The power state management profile is used to describe and to 
          manage the power state of computer systems. This includes e.g. means
          to change the power state of an entity (e.g. to shutdown the entity)
          which is an aspect of but not sufficient for active energy management.

        <section title="IEEE-ISTO Printer WG">
          <t> The charter of the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working Group is for 
          open standards that define printer related protocols, that printer manufacturers and related 
          software vendors shall benefit from the interoperability provided by conformance to these standards.
          One particular aspect the Printer WG is focused on is power monitoring and management of network 
          printers and imaging systems <xref target="IEEE-ISTO">PWG Power Management Model for Imaging Systems </xref>. 
          Clearly, these devices are within the scope of energy management since 
          these devices consume power and are attached to the network. In addition, there is ample 
          scope of power management since printers and imaging systems are not used that often. 
          IEEE-ISTO Printer working group has defined MIB modules for monitoring the power consumption 
          and power state series that can be useful for power management of printers. The energy management 
          framework should also take into account the standards defined in the Printer working group. 
          In terms of other standards, IETF Printer MIB <xref target="RFC3805">RFC3805</xref> has been 
          standardized, however, this MIB module does not address power management of printers. </t>
