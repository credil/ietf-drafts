This document includes comments and recommendations by the IAB on
some architectural and policy issues related to the chartering of
Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) in the IETF.  OPES are services
that would be deployed at application-level intermediaries in the
network, for example, at a web proxy cache between the origin server
and the client.  These intermediaries would transform or filter
content, with the explicit consent of either the content provider or
the end user.

This document is a product of the Internet Architecture Board.
