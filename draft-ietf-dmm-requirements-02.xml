<t>
This document defines the requirements 
for Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) 
in IPv6 deployments.  
The traditionally hierarchical structure 
of cellular networks 
has led to deployment models which are in practice centralized. 
Mobility management 
with logically centralized mobility anchoring 
in current mobile networks 
is prone to suboptimal routing
and raises scalability issues.
Such centralized functions 
can lead to single points of failure
and inevitably introduce longer delays 
and higher signaling loads 
for network operations related to mobility management. 
The objective is to enhance mobility management 
in order to meet the primary goals in network evolution,
i.e., improve scalability, 
avoid single points of failure, 
enable transparent mobility support to upper layers 
only when needed, and so on. 
Distributed mobility management must be secure
and compatible 
with existing network deployments and end hosts.
</t>
</abstract>
</front>

<middle>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>
In the past decade a fair number of mobility protocols 
have been standardized
 <xref target="RFC6275"/>
 <xref target="RFC5944"/>
 <xref target="RFC5380"/>
 <xref target="RFC6301"/>
 <xref target="RFC5213"/>.
Although the protocols differ 
in terms of functions and associated message formats, 
we can identify a few key common features:

<list>
<t>
a centralized mobility anchor 
providing global reachability 
and an always-on experience to the user;
</t>
<t>
extensions to the base protocols
to optimize handover performance 
while users roam across wireless cells; and
</t>
<t>
extensions to enable 
the use of heterogeneous wireless interfaces 
for multi-mode terminals 
(e.g. smartphones).
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
The presence of the centralized mobility anchor 
allows a mobile node to remain reachable 
when it is not connected to its home domain. 
The anchor point, among other tasks, 
ensures connectivity 
by forwarding packets 
destined to, or sent from, the mobile node. 
In practice,
most of the deployed architectures today 
have a small number of centralized anchors 
managing the traffic of millions of mobile nodes.
Compared with a distributed approach,
a centralized approach 
is likely to have several issues or limitations 
affecting performance and scalability,
which require costly network dimensioning 
and engineering to resolve.
</t>

<t>
To optimize handovers from the perspective of mobile nodes, 
the base protocols have been extended 
to efficiently handle packet forwarding 
between the previous and new points of attachment. 
These extensions are necessary 
when applications have stringent requirements 
in terms of delay. 
Notions of localization and distribution of local agents 
have been introduced to reduce signaling overhead
[Paper-Distributed.Centralized.Mobility]. 
Unfortunately, today we witness difficulties 
in getting such protocols deployed,
resulting in sub-optimal choices 
for the network operators. 
</t>

<t>
Moreover, the availability of multi-mode devices 
and the possibility of 
using several network interfaces simultaneously 
have motivated the development 
of even more protocol extensions
to add more capabilities to the base protocol.
In the end,
deployment is further complicated 
with the multitude of extensions. 
</t>

<t>
Mobile users are, more than ever, 
consuming Internet content; 
such traffic imposes new requirements 
on mobile core networks for data traffic delivery. 
When the traffic demand exceeds available capacity, 
service providers need to implement new strategies 
such as selective traffic offload 
(e.g. 3GPP work items LIPA/SIPTO 
[TS.23829])
through alternative access networks (e.g. WLAN)
[Paper-Mobile.Data.Offloading]. 
Moreover, the presence of content providers 
closer to 
the mobile/fixed Internet Service Providers network 
requires taking into account 
local Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) 
while providing mobility services.  
</t>

<t>
When demand exceeds capacity, 
both traffic offloading and CDN mechanisms 
could benefit from the development of mobile architectures 
with fewer levels of routing hierarchy 
introduced into the data path 
by the mobility management system. 
This trend towards so-called "flat networks" is reinforced 
by a shift in user traffic behavior.
In particular,
there is an increase in direct communications among peers 
in the same geographical area. 
Distributed mobility management 
in a truly flat mobile architecture
would anchor the traffic 
closer to the point of attachment of the user, 
overcoming the suboptimal route stretch 
of a centralized mobility scheme.

</t>

<t>
While deploying 
today's mobile networks, 
service providers face new challenges. 
Mobility patterns indicate that,
more often than not, 
mobile nodes
remain attached to the same point of attachment
for considerable periods of time
[Paper-Locating.User] .
Therefore it is not uncommon to observe that 
specific IP mobility management support 
is not required for applications 
that launch and complete their sessions 
while the mobile node is connected 
to the same point of attachment. 
However, currently,
IP mobility support is designed for always-on operation,
maintaining all parameters of the context 
for each mobile subscriber 
for as long as they are connected to the network. 
This can result in a waste of resources 
and ever-increasing costs for the service provider. 
Infrequent node mobility 
coupled with application intelligence  
suggest that mobility can be provided selectively, 
thus simplifying the context maintained 
in the different nodes of the mobile network.
</t>

<t>
The DMM charter addresses two complementary aspects 
of mobility management procedures: 
the distribution of mobility anchors 
towards a more flat network 
and the dynamic activation/deactivation 
of mobility protocol support 
as an enabler to distributed mobility management. 
The former aims at positioning mobility anchors 
(HA, LMA) 
closer to the user; 
ideally, 
mobility agents could be collocated 
with the first-hop router.
The latter, 
facilitated by the distribution of mobility anchors, 
aims at identifying when mobility support must be activated 
and identifying sessions 
that do not require mobility management support
-- thus reducing the amount of state information 
that must be maintained 
in various mobility agents of the mobile network. 
The key idea is that 
dynamic mobility management relaxes 
some of the constraints 
of previously-standardized mobility management solutions and,
by doing so,
it can avoid 
the establishment of non-optimal tunnels 
between two topologically distant anchors.
</t>

<t>
Given this motivational background in this section, 
this document compares distributed mobility management 
with centralized mobility management in Section 3. 
The requirements to address these problems 
are given in Section 4. 
Finally, security considerations are discussed in Section 5.
</t>
<t>
The problem statement and the use cases
[I-D.yokota-dmm-scenario]
can be found in

<section 
title="Centralized versus distributed mobility management">
<t>
Mobility management functions 
may be implemented at different layers 
of the protocol stack. 
At the IP (network) layer, 
they may reside in the network or in the mobile node. 
In particular, 
a network-based solution resides in the network only.
It therefore enables mobility for existing hosts 
and network applications
which are already in deployment but lack mobility support.
</t>

<t>
At the IP layer, 
a mobility management protocol supporting session continuity
is typically based on the principle 
of distinguishing between identifier and routing address
and maintaining a mapping between the two. 
In Mobile IP, 
the home address serves as an identifier of the device
whereas the care-of-address (CoA) 
takes the role of the routing address.
The binding between these two 
is maintained at the home agent (mobility anchor).
If packets can be continuously delivered 
to a mobile node at its home address, 
then all sessions using that home address 
are unaffected
even though the routing address (CoA) changes.
</t>

<t>
The next two subsections explain centralized and distributed
mobility management functions in the network.
</t>

<section title="Centralized mobility management">
<t>
In centralized mobility management, 
the mapping information 
between the persistent node identifier 
and the changing IP address of a mobile node (MN) 
is kept at a single mobility anchor. 
At the same time,
packets destined to the MN are routed via this anchor. 
In other words, 
such mobility management systems are centralized 
in both the control plane and the data plane.
</t>

<t>
Many existing mobility management deployments 
make use of centralized mobility anchoring 
in a hierarchical network architecture, 
as shown in Figure 1. 
Examples of such centralized mobility anchors 
are the home agent (HA) and local mobility anchor (LMA) 
in Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC6275"/> 
and Proxy Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC5213"/>, respectively. 
Current cellular networks 
such as the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 
UMTS networks, CDMA networks, 
and 3GPP Evolved Packet System (EPS) networks 
employ centralized mobility management too. 
In particular, 
Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 
and Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 
in the 3GPP UMTS hierarchical network, 
and the Packet data network Gateway (P-GW) 
and Serving Gateway (S-GW) in the 3GPP EPS network,
respectively, act as anchors in a hierarchy.

<t>Figure 2. Distributed mobility management.
</t>
<t>
Mobility management may be partially or fully distributed.
In the former case only the data plane is distributed.
Fully distributed mobility management implies that
both the data plane and the control plane are distributed.
These different approaches are described in detail in 
[I-D.yokota-dmm-scenario].
</t>

<t>
A distributed mobility management scheme 
for future flat IP-based mobile network architecture 
consisting of access nodes
is proposed in 
[Paper-Distributed.Dynamic.Mobility]. 
Its benefits 
over centralized mobility management 
are shown through simulations in 
[Paper-Distributed.Centralized.Mobility].
Moreover,
the (re)use and extension of existing protocols 
in the design of both fully distributed mobility management
[Paper-Migrating.Home.Agents] 
[Paper-Distributed.Mobility.SAE]
and partially distributed mobility management
[Paper-Distributed.Mobility.PMIP]
[Paper-Distributed.Mobility.MIP]
have been reported in the literature. 
Therefore,
before designing new mobility management protocols 
for a future flat IP architecture, 
it is recommended to first consider 
whether existing mobility management protocols 
can be extended to serve a flat IP architecture.

<section title="Requirements">
<t>
After comparing distributed mobility management
against centralized deployment in Section 3,
this section states 
the requirements as follows:
</t>

<!-- REQ1 -->
<section 
title="Distributed deployment">
<t>
<list style='format REQ%d:' counter="R_count">
<t>
Distributed deployment
<vspace blankLines="1" />
IP mobility, network access and routing solutions
provided by DMM 
MUST enable distributed deployment 
for mobility management of IP sessions 
so that traffic 
does not need to traverse centrally deployed
mobility anchors and thus
can be routed 
in an optimal manner. 
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Motivation: 
This requirement is motivated by 
current trends in network evolution:
(a) it is cost- and resource-effective 
to cache and distribute content 
by combining distributed mobility anchors 
with caching systems 
(e.g., CDN); 
(b) the significantly larger number of mobile nodes
and flows
call for improved scalability; 
(c) single points of failure are avoided
in a distributed system; 
(d) threats against centrally deployed anchors,
e.g., home agent and local mobility anchor,
are mitigated in a distributed system. 
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
This requirement addresses problems 
PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4 in the following.
</t>

<t>
<list style='format PS%d:' counter="PS_count">

<!-- PS1 -->
<t>
Non-optimal routes
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Routing via a centralized anchor 
often results in a longer route.
The problem is especially manifested 
when accessing a local server or servers 
of a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
</t>

<!-- PS2 -->
<t>
Divergence from other evolutionary trends in network architecture
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Centralized mobility management 
can become non-optimal 
with a flat network architecture.
</t>

<!-- PS3 -->
<t>
Low scalability of centralized route 
and mobility context maintenance
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Setting up routes through a central anchor
and maintaining mobility context 
for each MN therein requires more resources
is more difficult to scale 
in a centralized design,
thus reducing scalability. 
Distributing the route maintenance function 
and the mobility context maintenance function 
among different network entities 
can increase scalability.
</t>

<!-- PS4 -->
<t>
Single point of failure and attack
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Centralized anchoring 
may be more vulnerable 
to single points of failures and attacks
than a distributed system. 
The impact of a successful attack 
on a system with centralized mobility management 
can be far greater as well.
</t>

</list>
</t>


</section>

<!-- REQ2 -->
<section 
title="Transparency to Upper Layers when needed">
<t>
<list style='format REQ%d:' counter="R_count">
<t>
Transparency to Upper Layers when needed
<vspace blankLines="1" />
DMM solutions MUST provide 
transparent mobility support above the IP layer 
when needed. 
Such transparency is needed,
for example, when, 
upon change of point of attachment to the Internet, 
an application flow cannot cope with a change 
in the IP address. 
Otherwise, support for
maintaining a stable home IP address or prefix 
during handovers may be declined. 
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Motivation:
The motivation of this requirement is to
enable more efficient use of network resources 
and more efficient routing 
by not maintaining context 
at the mobility anchor 
when there is no such need.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
This requirement addresses the problems 
PS5 as well as the other related problem O-PS1.
</t>

<!-- PS5 -->
<t>
<list style='format PS%d:' counter="PS_count">
<t>
Wasting resources to provide mobility support 
to nodes that do not need such support
<vspace blankLines="1" />
IP mobility support is not always required,
and not every parameter of mobility context is always used. 
For example, 
some applications do not need a stable IP address 
during a handover to maintain IP session continuity. 
Sometimes, the entire application session runs 
while the terminal does not change the point of attachment. 
</t>
</list>

<!-- O-PS1 -->
<list style='format O-PS%d:' counter="O-PS_count">
<t>
Mobility signaling overhead 
with peer-to-peer communication
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Wasting resources when mobility signaling 
(e.g., maintenance of the tunnel, keep alive, etc.) 
is not turned off for peer-to-peer communication. 
Peer-to-peer communications 
have particular traffic patterns
that often do not benefit from mobility support
from the network.
Thus, the assoicated mobility support signaling
(e.g., maintenance of the tunnel, keep alives, etc.) 
wastes network resources for no application gain.
In such a case,
it is better to enable mobility support selectively.
</t>
</list>

</t>


</section>

<!-- REQ3 -->
<section 
title="IPv6 deployment">
<t>
<list style='format REQ%d:' counter="R_count">
<t>
IPv6 deployment
<vspace blankLines="1" />
DMM solutions SHOULD target IPv6 
as the primary deployment environment
and SHOULD NOT be tailored specifically to support IPv4, 
in particular in situations 
where private IPv4 addresses and/or NATs are used.
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Motivation:
This requirement is to be inline 
with the general orientation of IETF work. 
DMM deployment is foreseen 
in mid- to long-term horizon,  
when IPv6 is expected 
to be far more common than today.
It is also unnecessarily complex 
to solve this problem for IPv4, 
as we will not be able to use 
some of the IPv6-specific features/tools.
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<!-- REQ4 -->
<section 
title="Existing mobility protocols">
<t>
<list style='format REQ%d:' counter="R_count">
<t>
Existing mobility protocols
<vspace blankLines="1" />
A DMM solution SHOULD 
first consider reusing and extending 
IETF-standardized protocols 
before specifying new protocols.
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Motivation:
Using IETF protocols 
is easier to deploy and to update.
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<!-- REQ5 -->
<section 
title="Compatibility">
<t>
<list style='format REQ%d:' counter="R_count">
<t>
Compatibility
<vspace blankLines="1" />
The DMM solution MUST  
be able to co-exist 
with existing network deployments and end hosts.
For example,
depending on the environment in which DMM is deployed,
DMM solutions
may need to be compatible 
with other deployed mobility protocols
or may need to interoperate
with a network or mobile hosts/routers
that do not support DMM protocols.
Furthermore,
a DMM solution SHOULD work across different networks,
possibly operated as separate administrative domains, 
when allowed by the trust relationship
between them. 
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Motivation: The motivations of this requirement are
(1) to preserve backwards compatibility 
so that existing networks and hosts 
are not affected 
and continue to function as usual,
and 
(2) enable inter-domain operation if desired.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
This requirement addresses 
the following related problem O-PS2.
</t>

<t>
<!-- O-PS2 -->
<list style='format O-PS%d:' counter="O-PS_count">
<t>
Complicated deployment with 
too many MIP variants and extensions
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Deployment is complicated 
with many variants and extensions of MIP.
When introducing new functions
which may add to the complexity,
existing solutions are more vulnerable to break.
</t>

Security considerations
<vspace blankLines="1" />
DMM protocol solutions 
MUST consider security aspects,
including confidentiality and integrity. 
Examples of aspects to be considered are
authentication and authorization mechanisms 
that allow a legitimate mobile host/router 
to use the mobility support provided by the DMM solution; 
signaling message protection
in terms of authentication, 
encryption, etc.;
data integrity and confidentiality;
opt-in or opt-out data confidentiality 
to signaling messages 
depending on network environments 
or user requirements.
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Motivation:
Mutual authentication and authorization 
between a mobile host/router and an access router 
providing the DMM service to the mobile host/router 
are required to prevent potential attacks 
in the access network of the DMM service. 
Various attacks such as impersonation, 
denial of service, man-in-the-middle attacks,
and so on,
can be mounted against a DMM service
and need to be protected against. 
<vspace blankLines="1" />
Signaling messages can be subject to various attacks 
since they carry critical context information
about a mobile node/router. 
For instance, 
a malicious node can forge 
a number of signaling messages 
thus redirecting traffic from its legitimate path. 
Consequently, the specific node is  
under a denial of service attack,
whereas other nodes do not receive their traffic. 
As signaling messages may travel over the Internet, 
end-to-end security could be required.

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>
Distributed mobility management (DMM) 
requires two kinds of security considerations:
First, access network security 
that only allows 
a legitimate mobile host/router 
to access the DMM service; 
Second, end-to-end security 
that protects signaling messages 
for the DMM service. 
Access network security is required 
between the mobile host/router 
and the access network 
providing the DMM service. 
End-to-end security is required 
between nodes 
that participate in the DMM protocol.
</t>
<t>
It is necessary to provide sufficient defense 
against possible security attacks, 
or to adopt existing security mechanisms 
and protocols 
to provide sufficient security protections. 
For instance, 
EAP-based authentication 
can be used for access network security, 
while IPsec can be used 
for end-to-end security.

<abstract>
<t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 enables IP mobility for a host without requiring its participation in any mobility signaling, being the network responsible for managing IP mobility on behalf of the host. However, Proxy Mobile IPv6 does not support assigning a prefix to a router and managing its IP mobility. This document specifies an extension to Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol for supporting network mobility using DHCPv6-based Prefix Delegation.
