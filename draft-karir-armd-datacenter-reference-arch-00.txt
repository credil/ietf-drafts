Abstract

   The continued growth of large-scale data centers has resulted in a
   wide range of architectures and designs.  Each design is tuned to
   address the challenges and requirements of the specific applications
   and workload that the data is being built for.  Each design evolves
   as engineering solutions are developed to workaround limitations of
   existing protocols, hardware, as well as software implementations.

   The goal of this document is to characterize this problem space in
   detail in order to better understand if there is any gap in making
   address resolution scale in various network designs for data
   centers.  In particular it is our goal to peel back the various
   optimization and engineering solutions to develop generalized
   reference architectures for a data center.  We also discuss the
   various factors that influence design choices in developing various
   data center designs.

1. Introduction

   Data centers are a key part of delivering Internet scale
   applications.  Data center design and network architecture is an
   important aspect of the overall service delivery plan.  This
   includes not only determining the scale of physical and virtual
   servers but also optimizations to the entire data center stack
   including in particular the layer 3 and layer 2 architectures.
   Depending on the particular application requirements and scale, data
   centers can be designed in variety of ways.  Each design is often a
   representation of which aspects of the problem were and were not
   relevant to the purpose of that data center.  In this document we
   attempt to generalize the various design optimizations into a common
   generic architecture to facilitate the discussion of potential
   issues under a common framework.

2. Terminology

   ARP:     Address Resolution Protocol

   ND:      Neighbor Discovery

   Host:    Application running on a physical server or a virtual
            machine. A host usually has at least one IP address and at
            least one MAC address.

   Server:  a physical computing machine

   ToR:      Top of Rack Switch

   EoR:      End of Row

   VM:      Virtual Machines. Each server can support multiple VMs.

3. Generalized Data Center Design

   There are many different ways in which data centers might be
   designed.  The designs are usually engineered to suit the particular
   application that is being deployed in the data center.  For example,
   a massive web sever farm might be engineered in a very different way
   than a general-purpose multi-tenant cloud hosting service.  However
   in most cases the designs can be abstracted into a typical three-
   layer model consisting of the Access Layer, the Aggregation Layer
   and the Core.  The access layer generally refers to the Layer 2
   switches that are closest to the physical or virtual severs, the
   aggregation layer refers to the Layer 2 - Layer 3 boundary.  The
   Core switches connect the aggregation switches to the larger network
   core.  Figure 1 shows a generalized Data Center design, which
   captures the essential elements of various alternatives.

Internet-Draft   Data Center Reference Architectures       Oct 18, 2011


3.1. Access Layer

   The Access switches provide connectivity directly to/from physical
   and virtual servers.  The access switches might be placed either on
   top-of-rack (ToR) or at end-of-row(EoR) physical configuration. A
   server rack may have a single uplink to one access switch, or may
   have dual uplinks to two different access switches.

3.2. Aggregation Layer

   In a typical data center, aggregation switches interconnect many ToR
   switches. Usually there are multiple parallel aggregation switches,
   serving the same group of ToRs to achieve load sharing. It is no
   longer uncommon to see aggregation switches interconnecting hundreds
   of ToR switches in large data centers.

3.3. Core

   Core switches connect multiple aggregation switches and act as the
   data center gateway to external networks or interconnect to
   different PODs within one data center.

3.4. Layer 3 / Layer 2 Topological Variations

3.4.1. Layer 3 to Access Switches

   In this scenario the L3 domain is extended all the way to the Access
   Switches.  Each rack enclosure consists of a single Layer 2 domain,
   which is confined to the rack.  In general in this scenario there
   are no significant ARP/ND scaling issues as the Layer 2 domain
   cannot grow very large.  This topology is ideal for scenarios where
   servers (or VMs) under one access switch don't need to be re-loaded
   with applications with different IP addresses or hosts don't need to
   be moved to other racks which are under different access switches.
   A small server farm or very static compute cluster might be best
   served via this design.

3.4.2. L3 to Aggregation Switches

   When Layer 3 domain only extends to aggregation switches, hosts in
   any of the IP subnets configured on the aggregation switches can be
   reachable via Layer 2 through any access switches if access switches
   enable all the VLANs. This topology allows for a great deal of
   flexibility as servers attached to one access switch can be re-
   loaded with applications with different IP prefix and VMs can now
   migrate between racks without IP address changes.  The drawback of
   this design however is that multiple VLANs have to be enabled on all


Karir                  Expires January 24, 2012                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   Data Center Reference Architectures       Oct 18, 2011


   access switches and all ports of aggregation switches. Even though
   layer 2 traffic are still partitioned by VLANs, the fact that all
   VLANs enabled on all ports can lead to broadcast traffic on all
   VLANs to traverse all links and ports, which is same effect as one
   big Layer 2 domain.  In addition, internal traffic itself might have
   to cross different Layer 2 boundaries resulting in significant
   ARP/ND load at the aggregation switches.  This design provides the
   best flexibility/Layer 2 domain size trade-off.  A moderate sized
   data center might utilize this approach to provide high availability
   services at a single location.

3.4.3. L3 in the Core only

   In some cases where wider range of VM mobility is desired (i.e.
   greater number of racks among which VMs can move without IP address
   change), the Layer 3 routed domain might be terminated at the core
   routers themselves.  In this case VLANs can span across multiple
   groups of aggregation switches, which allow hosts to be moved among
   more number of server racks without IP address change. This scenario
   results in the largest ARP/ND performance impact as explained later.
   A data center with very rapid workload shifting may consider this
   kind of design.

3.4.4. Overlays

   There are several approaches regarding how overlay networks can make
   very large layer 2 network scale and enable mobility. Overlay
   networks using various Layer 2 or Layer 3 mechanisms enable interior
   switches/routers not to see the hosts' addresses. The Overlay Edge
   switches/routers which perform the network address
   encapsulation/decapsulation still however see host addresses.

   When a large data center has tens of thousands of applications which
   communicate with peers in different subnets, all those applications
   send (and receive) data packets to their L2/L3 boundary nodes if the
   targets are in different subnets. The L2/L3 boundary nodes have to
   process ARP/ND requests sent from originating subnets and resolve
   physical addresses (MAC) in the target subnets. In order to allow a
   great number of VMs to move freely within a data center without re-
   configuring IP addresses, they need to be under the common Gateway
   routers. That means the common gateway has to handle address
   resolution for all those hosts.  Therefore, the use of overlays in
   the data center network can be a useful design mechanism to help
   manage a potential bottleneck at the Layer 2 / Layer 3 boundary by
   redefining where that boundary exists.

4. Factors that Affect Data Center Design

4.1. Traffic Patterns

   Expected traffic patterns play an important role in designing the
   appropriately sized Access, Aggregation and Core networks.  Traffic
   patterns also vary based on the expected use of the Data Center.
   Broadly speaking it is desirable to keep as much traffic as possible
   on the Access Layer in order to minimize the bandwidth usage at the
   Aggregation Layer.  If the expected use of the data center is to
   serve as a large web server farm, where thousands of nodes are doing
   similar things and the traffic pattern is largely in/out a large
   access layer with EoR switches might be of the most use as it
   minimizes complexity, allows for servers and databases to be located
   in the same Layer 2 domain and provides for maximum density.

   A Data Center that is expected to host a multi-tenant cloud hosting
   service might have completely different requirements where in order
   to isolate inter-customer traffic smaller Layer 2 domains are
   preferred and though the size of the overall Data Center might be
   comparable to the previous example, the multi-tenant nature of the
   cloud hosting application requires a smaller more compartmentalized
   Access layer.  A multi-tenant environment might also require the use
   of Layer 3 all the way to the Access Layer ToR switch.

   Yet another example of an application with a unique traffic pattern
   is a high performance compute cluster where most of the traffic is
   expected to stay within the cluster but at the same time there is a
   high degree of crosstalk between the nodes.  This would once again
   call for a large Access Layer in order to minimize the requirements
   at the Aggregation Layer.

4.2. Virtualization

   Using virtualization in the Data Center further serves to increase
   the possible densities that can be achieved.  Virtualization also
   further complicates the requirements on the Access Layer as that
   determines the scope of server migrations or failover of servers on
   physical hardware failures.

   Virtualization also can place additional requirements on the
   Aggregation switches in terms of address resolution table size and
   the scalability of any address learning protocols that might be used
   on those switches. The use of virtualization often also requires the
   use of additional VLANs for High Availability beaconing which would
   need to span across the entire virtualized infrastructure.  This

Internet-Draft   Data Center Reference Architectures       Oct 18, 2011


   would require the Access Layer to span as wide as the virtualized
   infrastructure.

4.3. Impact of Data Center Design on L2/L3 protocols

   When a L2/L3 boundary router receives data packets via its L3
   interfaces destined towards hosts under its L2 domain, if the target
   address is not present in the router's ARP/ND cache, it usually
   holds the data packets and initiates ARP/ND requests towards its L2
   domain to make sure the target actually exists before forwarding the
   data packets to the target. If no response is received, the router
   has to send the ARP/ND multiple times. If no response is received
   after X number ARP/ND requests, the router needs to drop all those
   data packets. This process can be very CPU intensive.

   When a local host under the L2/L3 Router's L2 domain needs to send a
   data frame to external peers, it usually sends ARP/ND requests to
   get the physical address (i.e. MAC) of the L2/L3 routers. Many hosts
   repetitively send ARP/ND requests to their default L3 gateway
   routers to refresh its ARP/ND cache. This requires default routers
   to process great number of ARP/ND requests when the number of hosts
   under its L2 domains is very large. For IPv4, gateway routers
   frequently sending out gratuitous ARP for all the hosts under its L2
   domain to refresh their ARP cache for the default gateway's MAC
   address can mitigate this pain point. However, for IPv6 hosts need
   to validate bi-direction communication with the gateway router
   before sending any data frames. Therefore, unsolicited neighbor
   announcement from gateway router can't prevent hosts from sending ND
   repetitively.

   When hosts in two different subnets under the same L2/L3 boundary
   router need to communicate with each other, the L2/L3 router not
   only has to initiate ARP/ND requests to the target's Subnet, it also
   has to process the ARP/ND requests from the originating subnet. This
   process is even more CPU intensive.

5. Conclusion and Recommendation

   In this document we have described a generalized Data Center network
   design.  Our goal is to distill the essence of different designs
   into a common framework in an attempt to structure the discussion
   regarding various scaling issues that might appear in different
   scenarios.  Different application needs such as traffic patterns,
   and the role for which the data center is being designed determine
   various design choices, which result in various scaling issues with
   regards to port density, ARP/ND, VM mobility, and performance.  As

   expected, engineering solutions serve to tune a given design to the
   particular needs of the data center at the expense of other factors.
