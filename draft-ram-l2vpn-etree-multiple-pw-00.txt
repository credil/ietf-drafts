1. Introduction

   This document proposes a solution for Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF)
   Tree (E-Tree) support in Virtual Private LAN Service using LDP
   Signaling (LDP-VPLS) [RFC4762] or BGP Signaling (BGP-VPLS)
   [RFC4761].

   [Draft ETree VPLS Req] is used as requirement specification.

   The proposed solution is characterized by the use of two PWs between
   a pair of PEs, which requires extension to the current VPLS
   standards [RFC4762] and [RFC4761].

   This solution is applicable for both VPLS and H-VPLS.

   The proposed solution is composed of three main components:

     o Current VPLS standards: LDP-VPLS [RFC4762] and BGP-VPLS
        [RFC4761]

     o Extensions to the above specified in this document

     o PE local split horizon mechanism

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

3. The Problem

   [Draft ETree VPLS Req] identifies the problem when there are two or
   more PEs with both Root AC and Leaf AC.

         Figure 1: Problem Scenario for Leaf-to-Leaf Communication
                                Restriction

   When PE2 receives a frame from PE1 via the Ethernet PW:

     o PE2 does not know whether the ingress AC is a Leaf AC or not

     o PE2 does not have sufficient information to enforce the Leaf-
        to-Leaf communication restriction

4. The 2-PW Solution

   A simple fix is to carry additional information with each frame on
   the PW, indicating whether the frame is originated from a Leaf AC or
   a Root AC on the ingress PE.

   The proposed solution uses a pair of PWs to interconnect two VPLS
   PEs:

     o First PW is used for frames originated from Root ACs

     o Second PW is used for frames originated from Leaf ACs

   The next sections specify the required extension to current VPLS
   standards.

5. AC E-Tree Type

   Each AC connected to a specific VPLS instance on a PE MUST have an
   AC E-Tree Type attribute, either Leaf AC or Root AC. For backward
   compatibility, the default AC E-Tree Type MUST be Root.

   This AC E-Tree Type is locally configured on a PE and no signaling
   is required between PEs.

6. Extension to LDP-VPLS for E-Tree

   This section specifies extensions to LDP-VPLS [RFC 4762] to support
   E-Tree requirements. These extensions apply to both FEC types
   specified in [RFC 4762], namely PWid and generalized PWid.

6.1. VSI E-Tree Type and Identifier

   Two new PW interface parameters (as defined in section 5.5 of
   [RFC4447]) are defined for use in E-Tree VPLS: VSI E-Tree type and
   VSI E-Tree identifier.

   VSI E-Tree type can be either root or leaf and identifies VSI root
   PW and VSI leaf PW respectively, as defined in section 4.                                                             ..

   VSI E-tree identifier is a number that is used to identify a pair of
   root and leaf PW as part of the same logical bridge interface.

   The <VSI E-Tree identifier, VSI E-Tree type> pair SHALL be unique
   among PWs connecting a pair of VPLS PEs for the same VPLS instance.

Internet-Draft    Multiple PW Extension to VPLS for E-Tree    Feb 2012

6.1.1. VSI E-Tree Type Encoding

   The VSI E-Tree type field is encoded as an interface parameters sub-
   TLV (as defined in section 5.5 of [RFC4447]).

   The field structure is defined as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Type (TBD)   |    Length (1) |        VSI E-Tree Type        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   VSI E-tree Type can take the following values:

   0 E-Tree Root VSI

   1  E-Tree Leaf VSI

6.1.2. VSI E-Tree Identifier Encoding

   The VSI E-Tree identifier field is encoded as an interface
   parameters sub-TLV (as defined in section 5.5 of [RFC4447]).

   The field structure is defined as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Type (TBD)   |    Length (1) |     VSI E-Tree Identifier     |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  VSI E-Tree Identifier(cont.) |           Reserved            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   VSI E-tree Identifier is a 32-bit number that is used to identify a
   pair of root and leaf PW as part of the same logical bridge
   interface, in the context of a pair of VPLS PEs.

   The reserved field SHALL be set to zero.

6.2. Root/Leaf PWs Signaling

   Signaling of root and leaf PWs is required only when two PWs are
   used for interconnecting between pair of VSIs. As explained in
   section 6.1:




Ram et al.                Expires Aug 2012                    [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    Multiple PW Extension to VPLS for E-Tree    Feb 2012

     o Root VSI E-Tree type SHALL be used to signal a root PW.

     o Leaf VSI E-Tree type SHALL be used to signal a leaf PW.

   PW type signaling rules remain as defined in [RFC4447].

   It should be noted that in a full-mesh VPLS (as opposed to H-VPLS),
   the following VSI pair types do not require two interconnecting PWs:

   Root-only VSI <-> any VSI: only root PW required

   Leaf-only VSI <-> leaf-only VSI: no PWs required

   Where root-only VSI is a VSI where all ACs are of the root type, and
   leaf-only VSI is one where all ACs are of the leaf type.

6.3. Supporting Remote AC

   When PW is used to interconnect between VSI and a remote AC (e.g.
   the PW1, PW2 in Figure 3), an Ethernet Raw or Ethernet tagged PW
   types SHALL be used as defined in [RFC4762].

                Figure 3: VPLS with Remote AC Connectivity

   In addition, the AC type i.e. Root or leaf, SHALL be locally
   provisioned on the VSI side to specify the remote AC E-Tree Type per
   PW. Moreover, such PWs that are used for interconnecting between a
   remote AC and a VSI SHALL considered as separate logical bridge
   interfaces with respect to MAC address learning/forwarding e.g.

Internet-Draft    Multiple PW Extension to VPLS for E-Tree    Feb 2012

   traffic forwarding between such PWs is allowed as long as they are
   not both defined as Leaf.

   In Figure 3, AC1 is remotely interconnected to the VPLS service via
   PW1, and AC2 is remotely interconnected to the VPLS service via PW2.

   AC1 is a Root AC and therefore the local type for PW1 in PE1 SHALL
   be Root.

   AC2 is a Leaf AC and therefore the local type for PW2 in PE1 SHALL
   be Leaf.

7. Extension to BGP-VPLS for E-Tree

   This section specifies extensions to BGP-VPLS [RFC 4761] to support
   E-Tree requirements.

7.1. Auto-discovery

   Requirements in section 3.2.2 of [RFC 4761] apply, with the
   following modifications.

   Each PE with SHALL advertise two NLRIs for each VPLS instance, with
   the same VE-ID and non-overlapping label blocks.

   The PE SHALL assign one of the NLRIs for root traffic and the other
   one for leaf traffic by setting the root/leaf flag in the attached
   Layer2 Info Extended Community, as specified in section 7.2.

7.2. PW Setup and Teardown

   Requirements in section 3.2.3 of [RFC 4761] apply, with the
   following modifications.

   If a PE receives two VPLS NLRI announcements from a remote PE with
   the same VE-ID and different root/leaf indication, the PE SHALL set
   up two PWs to the remote PE. PW setup for each of the PWs follows
   the rules in 3.2.3.

7.3. Root/Leaf PWs Signaling

   The Layer2 Info Extended Community attribute is used to indicate
   root/leaf assignment for the associated VPLS NLRI.

   With reference to Figure 4, bit L in the control flags is defined in
   this document. Bits C, S have been defined in [RFC4761].

                        Figure 4 - Control Flags Bit Vector

   L can take the following values:

   0 E-Tree Root VPLS NLRI

   1  E-Tree Leaf VPLS NLRI

   A PW established following the receipt of a VPLS NLRI with root
   assignment will be known as root PW.

   A PW established following the receipt of a VPLS NLRI with leaf
   assignment will be known as leaf PW.

   Two PWs established following the receipt of VPLS NLRIs with the
   same VE-ID SHALL be associated to the same logical bridge interface.

7.4. Optimization

   As in the LDP case (section 6.2), root and leaf PWs need not be
   established between every VSI pair. However, BGP optimization to
   avoid root or leaf PW setup in these cases is not considered in this
   draft.

8. Data Forwarding Requirements

   On frame reception, two PWs associated to the same logical bridge
   interface SHALL be handled as a single bridge interface with respect
   to MAC address learning/forwarding, e.g. traffic SHALL NOT be
   forwarded between such PWs and MAC addresses in frames arriving at
   any of the PWs SHALL be learned on a common logical bridge
   interface.

   On transmission, the VPLS processing entity SHALL send root-
   originated traffic via the root PW, and SHALL send leaf-originated
   traffic via the leaf PW.

   An egress PE SHALL NOT deliver a frame originated at a leaf AC to
   another leaf AC.

   The following specifies how AC E-Tree type per frame is determined:

Internet-Draft    Multiple PW Extension to VPLS for E-Tree    Feb 2012

     o A frame received from a root PW indicates that the frame was
        originated from a root AC.

     o A frame received from a leaf PW indicates that the frame was
        originated from a leaf AC.

     o For the case where both ingress AC and egress AC are on the
        same PE, local split horizon implementation on the PE will be
        sufficient, and is not further discussed in this document.

9. Backward Compatibility

9.1. LDP-VPLS

   Root or leaf VSI E-Tree type and identifier parameters SHALL be used
   only in cases where both PEs are VPLS capable and both support E-
   Tree extensions defined in this document.

9.2. BGP-VPLS

   A PE SHALL announce a leaf VPLS NLRI only to remote PEs that support
   E-Tree extensions defined in this document.

10. Compliance with Requirements

   This refers to [Draft ETree VPLS Req] Section 5 Requirements.

   The solution prohibits communication between any two Leaf ACs in a
   VPLS instance.

   The solution allows multiple Root ACs in a VPLS instance.

   The solution allows Root AC and Leaf AC of a VPLS instance to co-
   exist on any PE.

   The solution is applicable to LDP-VPLS [RFC4762] and BGP-VPLS
   [RFC4762].

   The solution is applicable to Case 1: Single technology "VPLS Only".
