		<t>Our goal with this document is to
improve our agreement on the terminology used in documents produced
by the IETF Working Group for Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring.
Agreeing on terminology should help reach consensus on which problems we're trying to solve,
and  propose solutions and decide
which ones to use.</t>

      be incorporated into the architecture or other document.</t>

      <t>assessment
        <list>
          <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC5209"/> as "the process of collecting posture for a set of capabilities on the endpoint (e.g., host-based firewall) such that the appropriate validators may evaluate the posture against compliance policy."</t>
          <t>Within this document the use of the term is expanded to support other uses of collected posture (e.g. reporting, network enforcement, vulnerability detection, license management).  The phrase "set of capabilities on the endpoint" includes: hardware and software installed on the endpoint."</t>

      </t>
      
      <t>asset
        <list>
          <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC4949"/> as "a system resource that is (a) required to be protected by an information system's security policy, (b) intended to be protect by a countermeasure, or (c) required for a system's mission.</t>

      </t>
      
      <t>attribute
        <list>
          <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC5209"/> as "data element including any requisite meta-data describing an observed, expected, or the operational status of an endpoint  feature (e.g., anti-virus software is currently in use)."</t>

      </t>
      
      <t>endpoint
        <list>
          <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC5209"/> as "any computing device that can be connected to a network. Such devices normally are associated with a particular link layer address before joining the network and potentially an IP address once on the network. This includes: laptops, desktops, servers, cell phones, or any device that may have an IP address."</t>
          <t>Network infrastructure devices (e.g. switches, routers, firewalls), which fit the definition, are also considered to be endpoints within this document.</t>
          <t>Based on the previous definition of an asset, an endpoint is a type of asset.</t>

          <t>This term is used within the scope of this document to represent the state information that is collected from an endpoint (e.g. software/hardware inventory, configuration settings).</t>

          <t>Within this document this term represents a specific assertion about endpoint state (e.g. configuration setting, installed software, hardware).  The phrase "features of the endpoint" refers to installed software or software components.</t>

      <t>system resource
        <list>
          <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC4949"/> as "data contained in an information system; or a service provided by a system; or a system capacity, such as processing power or communication bandwidth; or an item of system equipment (i.e., hardware, firmware, software, or documentation); or a facility that houses system operations and equipment.</t>

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
