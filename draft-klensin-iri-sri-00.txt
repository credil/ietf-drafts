Abstract

   While the URI specification has been widely deployed, it has long
   been recognized that many valid URIs, especially those that contain
   extensive information in the "tail" are unsuitable for user
   presentation, especially for internationalized environments.  IRIs
   have been proposed as a solution for that problem but inherit (and
   are constrained by) the complex and sometimes method-dependent syntax
   model of URIs as well as positional and ordering assumptions that
   make them more difficult to localize than is desirable.

   This specification illustrates a way to define an "above URI" model
   for a localization-friendly simple reference identifier (SRI) that
   explicitly identifies fields and is more appropriate than IRIs to
   support localization.  The current version is intended simply to
   initiate a discussion.  In particular, while it is written to use an
   XML element syntax model, variations using JSON or some other system
   with explicitly-labeled data fields might be as, or more,
   appropriate.

1.  Introduction

   While the URI specification [RFC3986] has been widely deployed, it
   has long been recognized that many valid URIs, especially those that
   contain extensive information in the "tail" are unsuitable for user
   presentation, especially for internationalized environments.  IRIs
   [RFC3987] have been proposed as a solution for that problem but
   inherit (and are constrained by) the complex and sometimes method-
   dependent syntax model of URIs as well as positional and ordering
   assumptions that make them more difficult to localize than is
   desirable.

   This specification illustrates a way to define a localization-
   friendly "above URI" simple syntax (a "SRI") that explicitly
   identifies fields and is more appropriate than IRIs to support
   localization.

   [[anchor2: Note in Draft: "Simple" is chosen in the grand tradition
   of "simple" protocols like SMTP and SIP".  Certainly the parsing of
   the compound identifier into components is simpler than the URI
   model.  But suggestions for alternate terms would be welcome if
   "simple" turns into flame-bait.]]

   This specification obviates most, if not all, of the perceived need
   for IRIs and hence obsoletes the specification of them in RFC 3087.
   A discussion of the reasons for that action appears in Appendix A.

1.1.  Terminology

   The terms "i18n" and "l10n" are liberally used as abbreviations for
   "internationalization" and "localization", respectively, in this
   specification.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Status and Discussion

   [[anchor5: RFC Editor: Please remove this subsection.]]

   This draft is a pre-proposal to stimulate discussion of the IRI
   approach and alternatives to it.  While it is deliberately
   incomplete, the path to an actual proposal should be clear.  Also,
   the choice of an XML element syntax model [XML] structure was fairly
   arbitrary.  It would probably be equally reasonable to support a JSON
   [RFC4627] or other structure instead (or additionally) as long as the
   basic syntax chosen supports clear identification of data elements

   and a very precise and context-independent syntax for element values.

   Discussion of this draft should occur on the IRI WG mailing list.
   Details about subscription and archives for the list may be found at
   XXXXX.


2.  Tagged Elements

   Much of the complexity in the URI specification lies in trying to
   identify and extract the various parts of a URI.  That process is
   complicated by scheme-dependent elements and the associated
   delimiters which may be reserved or not depending on the scheme.
   That work may be appropriate if some system actually needs to parse
   and execute a URI -- an activity that requires understanding the
   scheme in any event-- but may be less appropriate for an i18n / l10n
   overlay.

   This specification overcomes that problem and the associated
   complexities introduced by characters outside the ASCII repertoire,
   URI escaping conventions, and so on by eliminating the constraint of
   forward compatibility with URIs in favor of a more international
   format that can be easily localized and equally easily be mapped into
   that URI syntax.


3.  Data Element Description

   This section maps the various components of URIs into XML elements.
   For purposes of this specification, the URI syntax is discarded; only
   the data elements are retained.  The mapping from an XML-structured
   document using these elements to URI syntax should be fairly obvious
   [[anchor8: ...and possibly covered in more detail in a future version
   of this spec]].  It is obviously possible to specify a collection of
   elements with this specification that, when mapped back into URI
   syntax, will be invalid or confusing for a particular scheme.  If
   that is perceived as an issue, specific lists of what elements are
   valid for which schemes should be easy to compile.

   The basic structure starts with a localization-friendly element that
   contains all other elements (and has no direct textual content):
   <SRI>

   [[anchor9: Note in Draft: Each of the subsections that follow can
   probably benefit from some fleshing-out.  For this version, the
   general intent should be clear.  It is likely that several more
   subsidiary elements are needed, but that is a topic for future
   discussion.]]

3.1.  scheme Element

   <scheme> SchemeName </scheme>

   The Scheme element has no subsidiary elements.

3.2.  authority Element

   <authority>
   Authority elements as below.
   </authority>

   The Authority element has the subsidiary elements listed in the
   subsections below.

3.2.1.  user-info Element

3.2.2.  host Element

   Domain names are subject to special rules because of IDNA
   considerations, so the normal content of the host element is a domain
   element.  [Domain-]relative URIs do not use the domain element.

3.2.2.1.  domain Element

   <domain> Fully-qualified-domain-name </domain>

3.2.3.  port Element

   <port> NN <port>
   NN is a numeric port number.

3.3.  path Element

   <path> PathString </path>

   [[anchor16: Subsidiary elements here, including <domain> and/or <SRI>

3.5.  fragment Element

   <fragment> FragmentName or other identifier </fragment>

   The Fragment element has no subsidiary elements.


4.  Internationalization and Escapes

   Part of the goal for the format specified here is to express the
   abstract components of a URI as naturally as possible.  Consequently,
   any text component of any element can be expressed in UTF-8 in
   normalization form NFC.  Escapes ("%" or otherwise) are prohibited
   except as required by XML.  If "%" appears, it must be doubled in
   mapping to URI syntax.


5.  Examples

   [[anchor22: There should be several of these, each showing a URI and
   the matching XRI form.]]

   The URI that would appear as
   http://example.com/test?sri=http://example.net/
   Would appear in this form as:

                <uri>
                   <sri>
                     <scheme>http</scheme>
                     <authority>
                       <host>
                         <domain>example.com</domain>
                       </host>
                     </authority>
                     <path>/test</path>
                     <query>
                       <sri>
                         <scheme>http</scheme>
                         <authority>
                           <host>
                             <domain>example.net</domain>
                           </host>
                          </authority>
                       </sri>
                     </query>

   a requirement.]]


6.  Acknowledgements

   Some of the structuring information for this document was derived
   from a W3C working draft on URLs [W3C-URL] as well as the URI
   specification.  The thinking that led to this work started with a
   discussion many years ago with James Seng in which he pointed out
   that the "natural" ordering of components of compound identifiers
   differed by culture.


7.  IANA Considerations

   [[anchor24: RFC Editor: Please remove this section before
   publication.]]

   This memo includes no requests to or actions for IANA.


8.  Security Considerations

   The model introduced in this specification does not raise any
   security issues not already present in the URI specification that
   would not be caught by a URI processor.  Because it is less subtle
   and complex than the URI specification, it may actually lead to a
   reduction in vunerabilities.

Appendix A.  This Specification and the IRI Approach

   The original IRI specification [RFC3987] was intended as a strict
   superset of the URI syntax [RFC3986] with all URI forms being
   permitted but with the use of non-escaped UTF-8 strings also being
   allowed.  IRIs were not separate protocol identifiers or intended for
   use "on the wire".  Instead, they were intended as an overlay for
   URIs that was more convenient for users.  In part because of the
   interaction with the original [RFC3490] and revised [RFC5890]
   versions of the IDNA specification, the mapping from IRIs to URIs was
   not unique: one could map a domain name expressed as a UTF-8 string
   into either a URI escape sequence or into a set of IDNA A-labels.
   That choice interacted badly with the domain name encoding
   considerations discussed by the IAB [RFC6055] and, more importantly,
   with URI comparisons in caches and similar contexts.

   Based on those and other considerations, an IETF WG charged with IRI

   revision [IRI-Charter] concluded that IRIs should be treated as a
   separate protocol identifier, primarily for use in new protocols,
   rather than as a strictly-forward-compatible URI overlay.  That
   decision immediately raised the question of whether it was more
   valuable to preserve a URI-like syntax or depart from it entirely.
   This specification resulted from the desire to explore the
   possibilities that would be opened up by abandoning the constraint of
   apparent similarity to the URI syntax.  But, just as the decision to
   move to a separate protocol identifier essentially recognizes that
   the IRIs defined in RFC 3987 was not feasible and an IRI variation
   that defined a new protocol element while retaining the general form
   of the URI syntax would obsolete 3987, this specification does as
   well: whether the underlying syntax model is changed or not, the WG
   has concluded that IRIs as defined in RFC 3987 are inappropriate for
   general use on the public Internet.
