1.  Introduction

   Wireless LAN Access Systems (WLAS) are complex systems that involve
   interworking many technology components defined by various standards
   bodies.  To ensure that the entire system is secure against
   sophisticated, persistent, and well-funded adversaries, each
   component MUST use strong cryptography.  However, the architectural-
   level cryptographic capabilities and relationships between the
   various protocols and security mechanisms provide by each of the WLAS
   architecture components have not been documented.

   In this note, we define a series of architectures based on common
   wireless LAN standards; IEEE 802.11 (a,b,g,i) [IEEE.802-11.2007],
   IEEE 802.11n [IEEE.802-11n.2009], Control and Provisioning of
   Wireless Access Points [RFC5415], RADIUS [RFC2865], IEEE 802.1x
   [IEEE.802-1X.2010], and the Extensible Authentication Protocol
   [RFC5247].  Within each of these architectures, we describe the uses
   of cryptography and in doing so, we capture an overall understanding
   of the cryptographic security of the Wireless LAN Access Systems.
   This document can also serve as a framework for future specifications
   to define profiles that specify particular cryptographic algorithms
   at each area of the architecture creating detailed specifications for
   interoperability with well understood cryptographic security
   properties.

   This document does not define new protocols, nor cryptographic
   algorithms.

3.  Architectures

3.1.  Overview

   The Wireless LAN Access System (WLAS) architectures discussed in this
   document describe host/user authentication, over the air security, as
   well as various methods for managing the backend processes to support
   that wireless LAN access system.  These backend processes include
   both distributed as well as non-distributed infrastructures for doing
   access control, authentication and Radio-Frequency management.

3.2.  Standalone WLAS

   The Standalone WLAS consist of a Wireless Termination Point (WTP or
   Access Point), an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting
   Service (AAA) that could resides on the WTP and an IEEE 802.1x
   [IEEE.802-1X.2010] supplicant that resides on the client.  This
   architecture is commonly deployed in small scale environments such as
   consumer and commercial deployments, or in places where backend
   resources are not available to provide a more distributed
   architecture.  The AAA service may reside on a separate server or may
   be incorporated directly within the WTP.  If a AAA server and 802.1x
   are not deployed then 802.11 Pre-Shared Keys MAY be used as a
   security mechanism.

                   |------(3)-----|

   Each of the lines in Figure 1 denotes communication that MUST be
   secured.  The numbers are defined in (Section 3.4).  This notation is
   used throughout this note.

3.3.  Centralized WLAS

   The Centralized WLAS is similar to the Standalone AP architecture
   with the addition of an Access Controller (AC) to manage the
   collection of WTP's.  This architecture utilizes [RFC5415] for
   control and provisioning of wireless access points (CAPWAP).

3.4.  Architectural Commonality

   In each of the above architectures, there are necessary services that
   we will describe in more details in the sections below. (1) describes
   authentication and authorization communications that occurs between
   the client and the AAA service in the form of an EAP method. (2)
   describes additional communications that occurs in support of EAP, as
   well as distribution of other keying material via the AAA service.
   (3a) Describes the over the air cryptography security between the
   client and WTP as addressed in the 802.11i specification
   [IEEE.802-11I.2004], the 802.11i encryption/decryption can occur at
   the AC as in (3b). (4) Describes the authentication and cryptography
   security between the WTP and the access controller as specified in
   CAPWAP [RFC5415].

4.  WTP to Access Controller Service Cryptographic Security

   Specific to the Centralized WLAS Architecture is the establishment of
   a secure channel between the WTP and the AC.  This command channel
   MUST be secured to insure the integrity of the communication between
   the AC and the WTP.  The IETF has defined CAPWAP [RFC5415] to
   communicate between the WTP and the AC however other methods such as
   IPSec [RFC4301] or TLS [RFC5246]/DTLS [RFC6347] can be implemented to
   secure the command and control traffic in addition to the user data
   channel.  In the case of CAPWAP, two separate channels exist between
   the AC and the WTP the CAPWAP Control and CAPWAP Data Channels.  The
   CAPWAP Control Channel encapsulates management messages between the
   AC and WTP (i.e.  WTP image, client Pairwise Transient Key, client
   Groupwise Transient Key) and is secured by DTLS, while the CAPWAP
   Data Channel encapsulates client wireless traffic from WTP to AC and
   can also be secured via DTLS.  In order to establish the Secure
   CAPWAP Control Channel between the WTP and the AC, x.509 certificates
   are installed on each device and used as part of the DTLS mutual
   authentication process.

5.  Client to AAA Service Cryptographic Security

5.1.  EAP Method

   The 802.11i specification defines a Robust Security Network (RSN) as
   one that utilizes IEEE 802.1x [IEEE.802-1X.2010] and the Extensible
   Authentication Protocol [RFC3748] to provide authentication and key
   management services between the client and WLAS.  EAP Authentication
   occurs between the client and the AAA service which may reside within
   a component of the WLAS (WTP or AC) or as a standalone AAA Server.
   It is not the intent of this document to specify the type of
   transport for the authentication service (i.e RADIUS, Diameter
   [RFC3588] etc) or the specific communication channel between the
   Network Access Server (NAS) and the Authentication Service.  Mutual-
   Authentication is achieved through the establishment of a secure
   channel for exchanging credentials between the client and the
   Authentication Server utilizing an EAP method employing Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) such as but not limited to EAP-TLS [RFC5216],
   PEAP, EAP-FAST, EAP-TTLS [RFC5281].  The main output of the EAP
   process is the generation of the Master Session Key (MSK) and
   Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) known only to the Client
   (supplicant) and the AAA server that will be used to generate the
   keying material for the cipher suites.  An in depth discussion on EAP
   Key management can be found in EAP Key Management Framework document
   [RFC5247].

5.2.  Pre Shared Key Method

   When 802.1x and an Authentication server are not used, Pre-Shared
   Keys (PSK) or passphrases can also be employed as a method of
   authenticating to a WLAS in a RSN in accordance with the Wi-Fi
   Alliances Wi-Fi Protected Access Personal profile (WPA2-PSK).  Unlike
   Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) where the shared key (40 or 104 bits)
   is concatinated with a 24 bit IV to be used as the RC4 stream cipher
   key, the WPA2-PSK or passphrase is used by the client supplicant to
   generate the 256 bit Pairwise Master Key (PMK) for keying material in
   the selected cipher suite.  However, operationally, PSK's are shared
   by multiple devices simultaneously so this method is less secure than
   the utilization of an EAP method and needs to be considered from an
   overall security perspective.

6.  Authenticator to AAA Service Cryptographic Security

   As stated in the previous section, the byproduct of EAP
   authentication is the generation of keying material to be used in the
   cryptographic process between the client and the WTP to secure the
   over the air communications.  The AAA server generates the AAA key
   which will be forwarded directly to the WTP in a Standalone WLAS, and
   forwarded to the AC in a Centralized WLAS where they will generate
   the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) (bits 0-255 of the AAA key).  The
   transmission of the AAA key needs to be protected between the AAA
   server and the WTP or the AAA server and the AC depending on which
   architecture is deployed.  NIST has previously made recommendations
   on securely encrypting plain text keying material for transport over
   insecure media with AES Key Wrap [AES_Key_Wrap] as well as industry
   with the Advanced Encryption Standard Key Wrap Algorithm [RFC3394].
   In addition to the transport of the keying material it is suggested
   that all AAA traffic between the Authenticator (WTP or AC) and the
   Authentication Service (AAA) be encrypted, methods such as but not
   limited to utilizing IPSEC, TLS or DTLS to secure the protocol.

7.  Wireless Link Layer Cryptographic Security

   Wireless link layer communication is protected through a series of
   cryptographic operations defined by 802.11i: the Advanced Encryption
   Standard Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message
   Authentication Code Protocol (AES-CCMP) and The Temporal Key
   Integrity Protocol (TKIP) which uses RC4 for encryption (TKIP has
   been deprecated in the later 802.11n standard) .  AES-CCMP is
   currently the preferred cryptographic algorithm for both unicast and
   multicast/broadcast traffic and the client MAY terminate the
   encrypted session at the WTP or the AC .  The PMK is independently
   generated on both the Client and the AAA server as the by product of
   EAP authentication.  A Pair Wise Transient Key (PTK) is then
   generated simultaneously on both the Client and the WTP/AC out of the
   PMK and is used as the unicast session encryption key.  A Groupwise
   Transient Key (GTK) is computed out of the Group Master Key (GMK) by
   the WTP/AC and is sent to each of the clients encrypted by the
   individual session PTKs.

8.  Cryptographic profiles

   In each of the above architectural areas, there are a number of
   different security protocols that serve various functions needed to
   build secure wireless LAN architectures.  Each protocol has important
   choices to be made in context of this overall cryptographic security
   within that protocol and subsequently has significant impacts to the
   overall security parameters of the system.  The security mechanisms
   are summarized in Table 1.

   TLS and DTLS are well studied and documented from a cryptographic
   strength perspective and there are a number of works that create
   profiles for TLS and DTLS and its use within systems of varying
   security requirements.  Table 2 provides an example of the
   cryptographic functional requirements necessary to define a TLS
   CipherSuite and associated security of each.  When profiling against
   this document, authors MUST define cryptographic algorithms for each
   function in Table 2

          Table 2: DTLS and TLS Cryptographic Security Algorithms

   Throughout the Wireless LAN Access System, TLS and DTLS are used in a
   number of different places.  Someone profiling wireless architectures
   might require alternative algorithm definitions for different uses of
   TLS/DTLS in the architecture.  One example might be a place that
   describes using TLS or DTLS to protect the transport of an ephemeral
   key vs its use to protect a long lived secret.  In this case, a
   profile might be willing to trade off less security of the
   cryptographic algorithms for the ephemeral key.

   Table 3 shows the places in the wireless architectures described in
   Section 3 that TLS or DTLS is used

   The security level provided by algorithm and key length choice for
   X.509 Certificates is well studied solely in context of the
   certificates itself.  Table 4 lists the types of cryptographic
   security functions used within X.509 Certificates and provides
   examples for each.  Any profile of Wireless LAN Architecture MUST
   include definitions for each cryptographic security function used
   within X.509 certificates.

8.3.  Link Layer Encryption

   Link Layer encryption for Wireless LAN Access Systems is well defined
   by the IEEE 802.11i standard and superseded by IEEE 802.11-2012.
   Future 802.11 standards need to address link layer encryption as an
   integral part of the standard.  Current 802.11 standards require the
   implementation of 128 bit key length.

                  Table 6: Link Layer Security Algorithms

   As a minimum, link layer encryption needs to be used in wireless
   architectures as indicated in Table 7 to protect the data in transit.
   When profiling against this document, authors MUST define
   cryptographic algorithms for each function described in Table 7.  In
   addition to over the air link layer encryption, there are other
   places where related, but different link layer encryption (i.e.
   802.1ae) could be leveraged within the wireless architecture.  Link
   layer encryption in these alternative places MAY be profiled for use
   in the overall cryptographic integrity of the system but are not
   covered here.

8.4.  AAA

   It is stringly suggested that traffic between the WTP/AC and the AAA
   service be secured to provide confidentiality and integrity of the
   user/device being authenticated as well as the key data used for the
   encryption process.  The use of the well documented cryptographic
   protocols IPSEC (Section 8.5), TLS or DTLS (Section 8.1) can be used
   to protect traffic between the WTP/AC and the AAA service.  When
   profiling against this document, authors MUST define the
   cryptographic algorithms for each function in listed in Table 8

             Table 9: IPSEC Cryptographic Security Algorithms

   IPSec in many cases has been superseded by other protocols for
   security within the Wireless LAN Access System.  However, IPSEC could
   play a role and Table 10 describes places in the WLAN Access System
   Architecture (Section 3) where it can be utilized.

9.  Security Considerations

   The cryptographic security level of a complex system is limited to
   that of the weakest component in the system.  The use of 128-bit
   block ciphers with 128-bit keys is now common, but in many systems,
   the security is limited by other factors, such as public keys with a
   strength of just 80 bits, or keys that are manually configured.  A
   typical security protocol uses multiple cryptographic algorithms to
   achieve different security goals: encryption to provide
   confidentiality, data authentication to protect the integrity of
   data, key derivation to provide the keys for those algorithms, key
   establishment to determine shared keys, and digital signatures to
   authenticate the entity on the other end of the wire.  In order to
   provide a high security level, a protocol needs to use algorithms and
   parameters that consistently meet that security goal.  Wireless
   systems use multiple security protocols, thus requiring consistency
   across multiple protocols.  To achieve consistency, one must first
   understand all of the cryptographic components in a wireless system.
   This note makes that process easier, by cataloging the components
   that appear in typical wireless architectures.

   It is also important to note that not all secrets are equal.  A
   secret which gives you access to data for a short period of time
   might be considered less important than one that exposes data for a
   longer period of time.  Depending on the system being built and
   associated security constraints, the value of the secret being
   protected can inform appropriate choices for the cryptographic
   strength over sub components of a wireless architecture.

   Finally, this note is intended to encourage the use of consistent
   cryptographic strenghts of confidentiality, integrity and
   authenticity within the entire wireless LAN architecture.  While
   profiles of this document might justify inconsistent algorithm
   strength choices, the profiles need to use cryptography throughout
   the architecture to provide end-to-end security.

9.1.  Algorithm Choices

   The choices of the algorithms to use in this document are left to the
   profile authors discretion.  However, it must be clear that profiles
   need to avoid the use of known broken cryptographic algorithms (i.e.
   WEP, TKIP, etc).
