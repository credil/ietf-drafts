  RESTful Authentication Pattern for the Hypertext Transport Protocol
                                 (HTTP)
                      draft-httpauth-rest-auth-00

Abstract

   This document proposes a "RESTful" pattern of authentication for
   HTTP/1.0, 1.1, and 2.0.  The goal is to make it easy to add
   authentication mechanisms to HTTP and to make it easy to implement
   them even without much help from the HTTP stack (though it is best to
   integrate authentication into the stack, of course).

   Among other benefits of RESTauth: it is orthogonal to "HTTP routers"
   and proxies, it results in session Uniform Resource Identifiers
   (URIs) that can be DELETEd to logout, naturally supports multi-legged
   authentication schemes, and it can be universally implemented on the
   server side with the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and FastCGI.

Internet-Draft           RESTful Authentication              August 2013


1.  Introduction

   We propose a pattern for HTTP [RFC2616] [XXX add reference to
   HTTP/2.0 as well?] authentication mechanisms that, by being
   "RESTful", obtains a number of benefits:

   o  authentication that works with all versions of HTTP, even when the
      authentication mechanism requires multiple round trips;

   o  compatibility with "HTTP routing" by making no assumptions that
      related requests are sent over the same TCP/TLS connection;

   o  channel binding, or an HTTP session protocol such as
      [I-D.williams-websec-session-continue-proto] (or any other meeting
      requirements of HTTP session protocols, described in
      [I-D.williams-websec-session-continue-prob]), can be used instead
      of web cookies;

      *  a "session URI" results that can be used to multiplex multiple
         sessions onto the same TCP/TLS connections;

      *  a "session URI" results that can be DELETEd to effect logout;

      *  a "session URI" results that has better security semantics than
         HTTP cookies;

   o  the ability to refer to multiple sessions in one request wherever
      such a concept might be useful;

   o  can be implemented by any application without changes being
      required to any HTTP stack;

      *  but it can also be implemented by the HTTP stack;

   o  on the server side this can be implemented entirely via CGI,
      FastCGI, WSGI, servlets, and so on;

   o  by its RESTful nature, multi-round trip authentication message
      exchanges are naturally handled without making any changes to
      HTTP.

   There are probably other benefits not listed above.

1.1.  Protocol Outline

   1.  initial authentication messages are POSTed to an agreed-upon or
       indicated "login" resource...




Williams                Expires February 15, 2014               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           RESTful Authentication              August 2013


   2.  ....which then results in a new resource being created with the
       authentication reply message as the new resource's
       representation.

   3.  Thereafter any additional authentication message exchanges needed
       (for multi-legged mechanisms) are POSTed to the new resource
       without creating additional resources.

   4.  The resource created by the POSTing of the initial authentication
       mechanism identifies the resulting session, and its URI is known
       as the session URI.

   5.  Session URIs can be used to multiplex multiple sessions over the
       same TCP/TLS connections, implement logout, and share sessions
       across multiple related servers.

   Authentication using mechanisms that require that the server send the
   first authentication message is also possible, in either of two ways:
   the initial authentication message is sent in headers in a 401
   response, or the client POSTs an empty first message to the login
   resource.

1.2.  API-Imposed Constraints

   To the extent that existing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
   assume specific styles of HTTP authentication message flows, if we
   want those APIs to support RESTauth backwards-compatibly, then those
   APIs may impose constraints on RESTauth.

   For example, the Android Account Manager API assumes a single round
   trip for authentication [XXX add reference!].  But the Android
   Account Manager could perform all but the last round trip on behalf
   of the application, then let the application perform the last round
   trip.  In order for that to work we need the authentication message
   exchange to be orthogonal to TCP/TLS connections -- that is, we need
   it to be possible to use multiple TCP/TLS connections for completing
   a single authentication exchange.  This is because the application
   and the account manager will likely be using different TCP/TLS
   connections.

   A typical constraining characteristic might be that an API assumes
   the use of GET with tokens encoded into the URI or into a header, or
   that the API makes no room for the use of headers in authentication
   message exchanges.

   One way to work around such constraints may be to provide various
   options in RESTauth.  Another might be to use OAuth 1.0 [RFC5849] or
   2.0 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] as a bridge: the API would use this framework

   under the covers then obtain OAuth credentials from the server that
   the application can then use in any way that the API's form allows
   for.

   characteristics that might constrain this and/or other frameworks.]]

3.  Protocol

   The are few normative protocol elements here besides the outline
   given in Section 1.  The normative protocol elements are:

   o  the form of the WWW-Authenticate header values -in 401 responses-
      for RESTauth mechanisms;

   o  several new headers for advertising negotiable parameters that are
      orthogonal to WWW-Authenticate;

   o  the POSTing of authentication messages from the client, with the
      initial client authentication message going to either a pre-agreed
      URI or to a URI named in the WWW-Authenticate headers;

   o  the creation of a session URI as a result of the initial POST, and
      the subsequent POSTing of any additional authentication messages
      to the session URI;

   o  the new session URI resource representation resulting from POSTs
      being the server's response authentication message, if any;

   o  the DELETEion of session URIs as signaling logout;

   o  a new header for referencing session URIs in normal HTTP requests;

   o  the use of channel binding [RFC5056] to TLS [RFC5246] for session
      protection;

   And for applications that may not use TLS/HTTPS:

   o  the use of session keys as an option for integrity protection when
      TLS is not used (a light-weight security mode); see
      [I-D.williams-websec-session-continue-proto].

3.1.  Negotiable Parameters

   As can be seen in the ABNF in the preceding section, the server can
   offer some negotiable parameters.  These are:

   o  Authentication mechanism names;

   o  Channel binding types;

   o  Session binding types;

   o  Replay protection;

Internet-Draft           RESTful Authentication              August 2013


   Each WWW-Authenticate [RFC2617] header value offers a single
   mechanism and negotiable parameters for it; because headers can have
   multiple values, WWW-Authenticate provides a method for negotiating
   authentication mechanisms.  The WWW-ChannelBinding-Types header
   (added here) allows the server to list channel binding types
   supported by it.

3.1.1.  Strong Binding to TLS

   Strong binding to TLS is provided via channel binding [RFC5056].
   When a RESTauth mechanism provides strong authentication of the
   service to the user, the combination of RESTauth and channel binding
   results in strong authentication of the server to the user even
   though TLS is used for session transport protection.

3.1.2.  WWW-Authenticate Header Value Prefix Syntax

   The ABNF for RESTauth WWW-Authenticate header values is as follows:

         challenge           = ( "RA-" mechname SP restauth-challenge )
         mechname            = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" )
         restauth-challenge  = ( login-uri SP session-types SP
                                 replay-prot SP *1(mech-challenge) )
         login-uri           = absoluteURI
         session-types       = "s=" session-type /
                               (session-type ":" session-types)
         session-type        = "cookie" / "session-ID" /
                               "channel-bound-session-ID" /
                               "MAC"
                               ; new session-types may be added
         replay-prot         = "r=" ("yes" / "no")
         mech-challenge      = <base64 encoded mech-specific data>

                 Figure 1: RESTauth WWW-Authenticate ABNF

   For a DIGEST-like mechanism it might look like "WWW-Authenticate: RA-
   Digest-SHA-256 tls-server-end-point session-ID no HE4SgWGrd/
   3+O7t16HqusA==".  For example, the mechname for the Kerberos V5 GSS-
   API mechanism might be "gss-krb5", and a WWW-Authenticate header
   value for it might look like "WWW-Authenticate: RA-gss-krb5
   http://foo.example/restauth-login tls-server-end-point channel-bound-
   session-ID r=no".

   Note that mechanisms that may be used include: GSS mechanisms, SASL
   mechanisms, ad-hoc mechanisms, and so on.

3.1.3.  WWW-ChannelBinding-Types Header

   A new header is added by which servers MUST indicate which channel
   binding [RFC5056] types -if any- they support for RESTauth
   authentication; if the server does not support channel binding then
   this header MUST be absent.  The header is named WWW-ChannelBinding-
   Types.  Its values are channel binding types from the channel binding
   type registry, such as the TLS channel binding types [RFC5929].

3.1.4.  WWW-ChannelBinding-Type Header

   A new header is added by which clients MUST indicate what channel
   binding type they used when POSTing RESTauth authentication messages,
   if any; if the client did not use channel binding then this header
   MUST be absent.  If the mechanism used has its own method for
   indicating the use of channel binding, then this header MAY be
   ommitted.  The header is named WWW-ChannelBinding-Type.  Its value is
   a channel binding type from the channel binding type registry
   [RFC5929].

3.1.5.  WWW-SessionBinding-Type Header

   A new header is added by which clients MUST indicate what session
   binding type they choose when POSTing RESTauth authentication
   messages.  The header is named WWW-SessionBinding-Type.  Its value is
   a session binding type as shown in Figure 1.  This header SHOULD be
   present in RESTauth authentication HTTP requests, but may be ommitted
   when the selected mechanism provides its own session binding facility
   that is distinct from RESTauth's (this helps adapt OAuth to RESTauth
   with minimal or no changes).

3.1.6.  WWW-ReplayProtection Header

   A new header is added by which clients MUST indicate whether they
   desire replay protection when POSTing RESTauth authentication
   messages.  The header is named WWW-SessionBinding-Type.  Its value is
   "yes" or "no" (defaults to "no" if absent) as shown in Figure 1.

   Replay protection is to be used only when TLS [RFC5246] is not used,
   and only if a session binding type of "MAC" is also requested.

3.2.  Protocol Flow

   RESTauth can be initiated by a client that knows a priori that it
   needs to or wants to use RESTauth.  Servers can also tell clients
   that access to certain resources require authentication, possibly
   including RESTauth mechanisms.  When the server tells the client that
   it must authenticate (using a 401 response, as usual), the server may



Williams                Expires February 15, 2014              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft           RESTful Authentication              August 2013


   also give the client an initial authentication message for one or
   more mechanisms.

   When the client knows a priori that it must authenticate then the
   client MUST know the RESTauth login URI a priori as well, as well as
   negotiable parameters, all of which the client might know from either
   an application protocol specification, or from caching this
   information from earlier RESTauth exchanges.

   The server MUST use a 401 HTTP status code and WWW-Authenticate
   headers to inform the client of the need to authenticate in order to
   access a given resource.  For RESTauth mechanisms the WWW-
   Authenticate header values MUST conform to the ABNF given in
   Section 3.1.2.

   To proceed the client chooses a suitable authentication mechanism
   (for which, presumably, it has credentials for a desired client
   identity), possibly a channel binding type, possibly a session type,
   and whether to use replay protection.

3.2.1.  One Round Trip Optimization: Challenges Borne in WWW-
        Authenticate Headers

   Some mechanisms may optimize the protocol flow by allowing the server
   to include challenges in the 401 response's WWW-Authenticate header
   values.  DIGEST-MD5 works this way, for example, sending a challenge
   nonce to be fed into the digest function (along with other client-
   side inputs).

   RESTauth allows this, but this feature is OPTIONAL: it must always be
   possible for a client to initiate RESTauth without first obtaining a
   challenge in a WWW-Authenticate header value, in which case the
   client may incur an extra protocol leg by obtaining the challenge (if
   it is at all necessary) in the server's reply to the client's first
   authentication message.  There are two reasons for making this
   optional:

   1.  to allow client applications that know a priori that they must
       authenticate (and how to), requiring no further negotiation;

   2.  to support authentication mechanisms that require that the client
       initiate authentication message exchanges.

   A challenge may consist of a nonce, some encrypted or MACed nonce, a
   time-stamp, certificates and digital signatures, etcetera.  The
   server may include a login URI in challenge-laden WWW-Authenticate
   headers where the login URI encodes secure state regarding the
   challenge (e.g., the challenge encrypted in a symmetric key known

Internet-Draft           RESTful Authentication              August 2013


   only to the server).

3.3.  Session Binding Types: Cookie, Session URI, and MAC

   A notion of session binding type is added for binding HTTP requests
   to specific RESTauth login sessions.  Three types are provided:

   Cookies  The traditional HTTP cookie approach to session binding;

   Session URI  HTTP requests carry a WWW-Session-URI header identifying
      the session(s) (similar to cookies, but without all the associated
      baggage);

   Channel Bound Session URI  Like Session URI, but may only be used in
      HTTPS connections with the same channel bindings.  (This implies
      use of the 'tls-server-end-point' channel binding type.)

   MAC  HTTP requests carry a WWW-Session-URI header identifying the
      session(s) and a WWW-Session-MAC header that carries a MAC or MACs
      binding the session URI(s) to the request.

3.3.1.  The New WWW-Session-URI Header

   A new HTTP header is added called WWW-Session-URI whose values
   consist of session URIs.  At least one session URI MUST be included.
   Each session URI is an absoluteURI.  Session URIs MUST NOT have
   unescaped commas (',') embedded in them.  Servers MAY fail to
   implement support for multiple session URIs being referenced by a
   single request, in which case they MUST answer with error code <TBD>.
   Servers MUST validate the session URI before processing the request;
   if the session URI is invalid the server MUST respond with a 401 (or
   TBD?) status code.

   Note that referencing multiple session URIs is permitted, but this
   may not be meaningful for the application, thus the server MAY reject
   this (TODO: specify a status code for this?).

   [[anchor2: I can imagine a webmail application where a client can be
   logged in as multiple users and get a unified view of the users'
   mailboxes.  This seems unlikely, but why rule out such use cases?]]

3.3.2.  The New WWW-Session-MAC Header

   [[anchor3: Describe the header, its values, algorithm agility, and
   what the MAC is to be taken over.  Note too that this cannot apply to
   request contents as we have to consider chunking, and besides, a MAC
   of contents really has to go as a trailer, not a header.]]

   [[anchor4: We may want to remove this anyways and leave it for a
   session continuation spec.  Or we may want to require the use of
   HTTPS.]]

3.3.3.  A MAC Trailer??

   [[anchor5: ...  This is only needed for RESTauth *without* TLS, which
   will probably not be the common mode of use for RESTauth... unless we

4.  Representation of Authenticated Session Resources

   It will generally be useful to be able to GET a session resource to
   obtain information about the authenticated user.  A GET on a session
   resource which is not fully established SHOULD return an empty body.

   [[anchor7: TODO: Add a media type for session resource
   representation.]]

   [[anchor8: Use JSON instead of ABNF?  A schema language would be
   nice.]]

     session             = 1*( session-param )
     session-param       = session-param-name '=' session-param-value
     session-param-name  = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT / '-' / '_' )
     session-param-value = <quoted or base64>

   Session parameters include:

   established  "true" or "false"

   expiration_time  Datetime when the session expires.

   session_key_MAC_req  Session key for MACs in requests.

   session_key_MAC_resp  Session key for MACs in responses.

   authorization_data  Information about the authenticated user.

   user_id  The authenticated user identity.

   The server MAY exclude any part of this when the entity requesting a
   session resource is the session's user.  The server MUST exclude (or
   respond with 401) all of the session resource's representation when
   the entity requesting it is not authenticated or authorized to see
   it.  The server SHOULD exclude locally-determined authorization_data
   and/or user_id information when the entity requesting the resource is
   the session's user.

5.  HTTP "Routing" and Authentication

   It is common to deploy HTTP services with load-balanced servers
   behind a load balancer and TLS concentrator.  Other techniques may
   also result in a multiplicity of servers acting on behalf of a single
   service.  The load balancers may even behave like routers and route
   HTTP requests to the same server for all requests in a single
   connection, or even route HTTP requests according to the verb and
   resource.  It helps to be able to have a notion of authenticated
   sessions that can be referenced by all servers responding to a given
   service name.

   The server end of a RESTauth authentication message exchange may be
   terminated by one server, by many servers sharing session state (via
   the resources named by session URIs), or by a server-side HTTP
   router.  Once a RESTauth session is established we assume that all
   servers responding to the same service name will be able to access
   the session resource, validate session URIs, and obtain keys for
   computing and validating session binding MACs.  Alternatively, the
   router may take responsibility for session binding and signal
   authorization information from the established session to the HTTP
   servers behind the router (however, we do not here specify any
   methods for such signaling).

   By using REST for the authentication message exchange we allow this
   disconnection between "session" and "connection", which therefore
   facilitates "routing" of HTTP requests and even off-loading of
   authentication and/or session binding to HTTP "routers".

   This approach should be flexible enough for all existing
   architectures for deploying HTTP services.

6.  In-band HTTP Authentication Alternatives

   RESTauth is "out-of-band" in the sense that the authentication
   messages are exchanged independently of the application's requests
   for normal resources.  Of course, RESTauth exchanges may well (and
   often will) happen in the same TCP/TLS connection as normal
   application requests, so RESTauth is not really out-of-band.  We use
   "out-of-band" and "in-band" very loosely in this section.

   There exist several "in-band" HTTP authentication alternatives where
   the authentication message exchanges happen in the context of
   application resources.  Here the HTTP verb and resource are
   application-specific and have nothing to do with authentication, and
   the authentication messages are exchanged via HTTP request and
   response headers with the server responding with a 401 status code
   until authentication is complete.

   The extant "Basic" and "DIGEST-MD5" [RFC2617] HTTP authentication
   methods, as well as HTTP/Negotiate [RFC4559] are "in-band" HTTP
   authentication methods.

   In so far as an in-band authentication method results in a cookie or
   session URI/ID the distinction between in-band and out-of-band is
   almost trivial, as described above: authentication messages in
   headers vs. bodies, and HTTP verb and URL.  However, if in-line
   authentication methods are strongly tied to the TCP/TLS connections
   over which they were utilized then that is a big disadvantage over
   RESTauth: each connection requires re-authenticating, and support for
   HTTP routing schemes is not clear.

   HTTP/Negotiate is more troublesome because historically it has
   required re-authentication per-HTTP request(!).

   Even if the only difference between in-band and out-of-band is a
   trivial one, using the REST pattern means that authentication can be
   implemented using with no help from the HTTP stack (even though it's
   desirable to have it implemented within/by the HTTP stack), whereas
   there may not be a way to implement in-band authentication without
   help from the HTTP stack for some stacks.

7.  Sample/Potential RESTauth Authentication Mechanisms

   Here we describe (informatively, for the time being) how to use or
   adapt a variety of authentication mechanisms, from SSHv2, IKEv2,
   SASL, GSS-API, and other frameworks, so as to quickly gain a set of
   usable mechanisms, both, specification- and implementation-wise.
   This section is also intended to show that adding RESTauth mechanisms
   is easy.

7.1.  OAuth via RESTauth

   OAuth 1.0 RFC5849 and OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] are commonly
   deployed.  Being able to use OAuth via RESTauth would be useful.  We
   attempt to make RESTauth such that at least for OAuth 1.0 there is a
   standard way to use OAuth such that it conforms to RESTauth.

7.1.1.  OAuth 1.0

   For OAuth 1.0 [RFC5849] the "form-encoded body" form (see section
   3.5.2 of [RFC5849]) of OAuth 1.0 conforms to RESTauth without further
   changes.

7.1.2.  OAuth 2.0

   [It looks like OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] also uses POST to send
   tokens to the server, and it looks like it too effectively conforms
   to RESTauth.]

7.2.  Adapting SSHv2 Authentication Mechanisms to RESTauth

   SSHv2 "userauth" mechanisms [RFC4252] typically involve a digital
   signature (or similar) of an SSHv2 session ID.  There is no such
   thing as an SSHv2 session ID in HTTP.  A session URI cannot serve as
   a stand-in for an SSHv2 session ID because a) the session URI is an
   outcome of authentication in RESTauth, b) to prevent cut-n-paste and
   replay attacks the client and the server both must contribute to the
   entropy of the session ID that is signed by the client.

   In order to adapt SSHv2 userauth methods properly (i.e., securely),
   we have replace the SSHv2 session ID in the to-be-signed data with a
   hash of the channel binding and nonces contributed by the client and
   the server.  As an optimization the server nonce can be sent as a
   challenge (this saves a round trip).

7.2.1.  RESTauth Mechanism Names for SSHv2 Userauth Methods

   For hash agility reasons the hash function name is part of the SSHv2
   RESTauth mechanism name.  To avoid "multi-level negotiation" the

Internet-Draft           RESTful Authentication              August 2013


   SSHv2 userauth method name is also part of the RESTauth mechanism
   name.

   The RESTauth mechanism name form for SSHv2 userauth methods, then,
   is: ssh-<SSHv2-userauth-method-name>-<hash-function-name>.

   The following RESTauth mechanisms are defined here:

   o  ssh-publickey-SHA-256

   o  ssh-hostbased-SHA-256

7.2.2.  Nonces

   The client and the server must each contribute 128-bit nonces.

7.2.3.  "Session ID"

   The ssh-publickey-SHA-256 and ssh-hostbased-SHA-256 mechanisms use
   the following instead of a traditional SSHv2 session ID:

   o  SHA-256(channel_binding || server_nonce || client_nonce)

   Here the <channel_binding> is as per-[RFC5056]: the channel binding
   type name, followed by the channel binding data (e.g., 'tls-server-
   end-point' followed by the server EE certificate as sent in the
   server's TLS Certificate message).

   Note that use of channel binding when using SSHv2 mechanisms is
   REQUIRED so as to defeat cut-n-paste attacks by weakly-authenticated
   servers.

7.3.  Adapting IKEv2 Authentication Mechanisms to RESTauth

   [[anchor9: TBD.]]

7.3.1.  Adapting IKEv2 Password Authenticated Connection Establishment
        (PACE) to RESTauth

   [[anchor10: TBD.]]

7.4.  Using SASL Authentication Mechanisms with RESTauth

   Simple Authentication and Security Layers (SASL) [RFC4422] is a
   simple, pluggable framework for authentication mechanisms.

   To use a SASL mechanism in RESTauth just prefix "SA-" to the SASL
   mechanism name and use that as the RESTauth mechanism name.  If the

   SASL mechanism is server-initiated then the server's challenge is
   sent in the server's WWW-Authenticate header value as described
   above.  All other SASL authentication messages are exchanged as
   described above (i.e., via POSTs, first to the login URI, then to the
   session URI, with response messages as the new representation of the
   session resource).

   The HTTP status code functions as the application's outcome of
   authentication message.  If SASL succeeds but authorization fails
   then the server should respond with a 401 status code to the POST of
   the final SASL authentication message from the client.

   The server's WWW-Authenticate header values function as the mechanism
   listing operation.  SASL security considerations [RFC4422] [RFC5801]
   apply (particularly regarding the negotiation of channel binding
   support).

7.4.1.  Using SCRAM in RESTauth

   The Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM)
   [RFC5802] is a DIGEST-like mechanism for SASL.  Nothing special is
   needed to use SCRAM versus any other SASL mechanism, except for a
   round trip optimized form of SCRAM, if we decide to pursue that (see
   Section 7.4.2).

   The following figure shows what SCRAM in RESTauth looks like.  Note
   that the resource representations are taken verbatim from [RFC5802].

   The Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-
   API) [RFC2743] is another pluggable mechanism framework.  Any GSS-API
   mechanism that supports channel binding [RFC5056] can be used as SASL
   mechanisms via the "SASL/GS2" bridge [RFC5801].  This includes the
   Kerberos V5 GSS-API mechanism [RFC4121].

   GSS-API security mechanisms could also be used without SASL/GS2, but
   SASL/GS2 barely adds any overhead or complexity (a SASL

   implementation is not required in order to use SASL/GS2, just a GSS

   security context token and to the channel binding data, with both
