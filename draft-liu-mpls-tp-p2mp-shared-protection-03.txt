 Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile p2mp Shared Protection
              draft-liu-mpls-tp-p2mp-shared-protection-03

Abstract

   This document will describle two protection solutions to support
   protection of failures in p2mp path in MPLS-TP.  According to the
   protection Requirements in RFC 5654, there are requirements for
   MPLS-TP to support sharing of protection resources such that
   protection paths that are known not to be required concurrently can
   share the same protection resources.  In addition, there is a
   requirement for MPLS-TP to support unidirectional 1:n protection for
   p2mp paths.  These requirements are further addressed in
   draft-ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk . so this draft will present proposed
   solutions .


   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
   Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
   Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include
   an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
   to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
   network as defined by the ITU-T.

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP p2mp shared protection           March 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document describes protection solutions for MPLS-TP p2mp paths.
   The first solution is based on extending 1:1 protection solution to
   implement 1:n protection by using one shared protection p2mp path
   when there may have failures on the protected working p2mp paths.  A
   second solution uses one p2mp protection path to protect each
   protected p2mp working path, and these p2mp protection path maybe
   share common segment resource. when detecting defects on a p2mp
   working path to implement (1:1)^n protection.  Both protection
   solutions satisfy and fulfill requirement 69 and 67B in [RFC 5654].
   These solutions can't exclude 1+1 and 1:1 protection solutions for
   p2mp path in draft-ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk and
   draft-ietf-mpls-tp-linear-protection. it will be used to implement
   the requirement of recovery for p2mp path.  If only 1+1 protection is
   used for p2mp path, there need to set up a disjoint protection path
   for each working path, This will increase the cost of maintaining and
   monitoring each of these paths (i.e. both the working and protection
   paths).  In addition, since the p2mp service must be transported on
   both the working and protection paths at the same time, more
   bandwidth resource will be wasted for the p2mp service .  Due to
   these limitations and defects, it is neccesary to consider using
   shared protection resources for many p2mp working paths.

3.  p2mp shared protection solution

   This section describes two types of p2mp shared protection solutions.
   The first proposed solution utilizes one p2mp protection path to
   protect many p2mp working paths .  When a protected p2mp working path
   detects a failure, the leaf node of the p2mp working path will notify
   its own root node of defective message by RDI packet by return path.
   If there is no other higher priority protected p2mp working path or
   control command that requires the use of the protection path, then
   the defective p2mp service packet will switch to p2mp protection path
   to be transported.  All leaf nodes of the defective p2mp path will
   select protection path to receive p2mp service packets.

   The second proposed solution utilizes one p2mp protection path to
   protect its corresponding protected p2mp working path.and these
   protection paths maybe shared common segment resource.  When a
   failure is detected on a protected p2mp working path, the leaf node
   which has already detected the failure will notify root node of the
   failure message. then the root node of protection path will be basis
   on the priority of protected service or failure to select the highest
   priority service to be protected. then it will notity all leaf nodes
   of which working path will be protected by extensive PSC packet as
   the following figure 1.As a result, the selected failure service will
   switch to the protection path to be transported .

   The two p2mp shared protection solutions separately implement 1:n and
   (1:1)^n protection for p2mp path, The following sub-section describes
   the protection switching methods in detail.

3.1.  1:n protection

   The 1:n protection solution should be similar to 1:1 protection
   solution described in [survivability-framework] to use one protection
   path to protect many p2mp working paths.  However, in this mechanism
   since the protected traffics are transported by different working

   path.  Its implication regarding the p2mp protection path will be
   configured between the protection domain root node and all leaf nodes
   of protected p2mp working paths. when a leaf node of a protected p2mp
   working path detect a failure, The leaf node should generate RDI
   packet to notify its own root node of the defective message .  When
   the root node of the p2mp working path receives the RDI packet and
   knows some failures in one or more one branch path of the p2mp
   working path, it may send protection switch requirement control
   packet to the root node of its own protection path or access node of
   the protected p2mp service.  When the root node of the protection
   path receives the protection switch requirement control packet from
   any root node of the protected defective p2mp working path The root
   node of the protection path MUST choose one defective path to be
   protected based on the priority of these protected defective p2mp
   working paths.  Then the root node of protection path SHALL generate
   extensive PSC packet including the selected p2mp defective path
   identifier in a TLV field of the message packet .The following figure
   1 is the format of extensive PSC packet .Then it will send the
   extensive PSC message to all leaf nodes of the p2mp protection path .

   At the same time, the root node of the protection path generates
   notify message control packet including selective protected working
   path identifier and send it to the root node of each defective p2mp
   working path by control channel ,so the root node of each defective
   p2mp working path can know whether it may be selected to be protected
   based on the notify message control packet.  If it has already been
   selected to be protected, it will stop sending service packet on the
   p2mp working path Then the protected service will switch to the p2mp
   protection path to be transported.

   On the other hand, all leaf nodes of the protection path receive the
   extensive PSC message by the protection path.  Then they will know
   whether to accept and process the service packet from the protection
   path based on p2mp LSP ID TLV field in the extensive PSC packet.  If
   the leaf node is a sink node of the protected service, it will accept
   and process the service packet from the protection path.  Or else, it
   will drop the service packet.

   For the above p2mp network topology , there are two different p2mp

   failure on separately branch path(r1-p2mp path 1-L1) of p2mp working
   path 1 and branch path(r2-p2mp path 2-L2) of p2mp working path 2,
   Leaf node L1 and leaf node L3 will separately send RDI packet to root
   node r1 and root node r2 by return path. when root node r1 and r2
   received the RDI packet and processed it. then the control packet of
   protection switch requirement will be sent to the root node P of
   protection path by control channel .  Then the root node P will
   choose one working path to be protected.  As the priority of p2mp
   working path 1 is higher than p2mp working path 2. so the root node P
   of protection path will select p2mp working path 1 to be protected,
   and send extensive PSC packet including p2mp LSP ID TLV to all Leaf
   nodes(L1,L2,L3) of the protection path.  At the same time, It will
   generate response control packet for the protection switch
   requirement of the root node r1 and r2. the service of the working
   path 1 will be selected to be protected.  So the root node r1 of
   working path 1 will stop sending its p2mp service in the working path
   1, Then the service of the working path 1 will switch to the
   protection path to be transported. on the other hand, for leaf nodes(
   L1,L2,L3), when they received the extensive PSC packet from the root
   node P, They will decide whether to accept and process the service
   packet from the protection path based on selective protected working
   path identifer.  As leaf nodes(L1,L2) are the leaf nodes of p2mp
   working path 1, they will both accept and process the service packet
   from the p2mp protection path. but for leaf node L3, as it is not the
   leaf node of p2mp working path 1. it will drop the service packet
   from the p2mp protection path.  While the service of p2mp working
   path 2 can't be selected to be protected, so the root node r2 will
   continue to send their own service packet by p2mp working path 2.


3.2.  (1:1)^n protection

   This protection solution can use p2mp protection path to protect its
   corresponding p2mp working path.and these protection paths will share
   a few common segment resource.when a failure is detected on some
   protected p2mp working path, it must notify the failure message to
   the root node of its corresponding protection path. when the root
   node of the protection path received the failure message, it must
   compare the priority among these protection paths and select the
   highest priority service to be tranported on its corresponding
   protection path.and it notify each leaf node of the protection path
   which protection path will be selected to use the common protection
   resource by extending PSC message.

   for example, there is a (1:1)^2(n=2) protection instance as the
   following figure 4:

   there are two p2mp working paths : p2mp working path 1(r1-p2mp Path

   2-L2,L3) identified by (#).in order to protect the service, its
   corresponding protection path( P-shared path-L1,L2) and (P-shared
   path-L2,L3) identified by(@) will be pre-configured for working path
   1 and working path 2. and the two protection path will share common

   when the p2mp working path LSP 1 and the p2mp working path LSP 2 have
   a failure at the same time, The leaf node L2 will generate failure
   notify message to send to the root node R1 and R2 .  Then R1 and R2
   will notify the root node(P) of the failure. so the root node P will
   select the higher priority working path to be protected and notify
   all leaf nodes of the protection path which working path will be
   protected by extensive PSC packet including selective protected p2mp
   LSP identifier. when these leaf nodes receive the extensive PSC
   packet, they decide which path to receive the service packet. here if
   the root node P select working path 1 to be protected. so the leaf
   nodes L1,L2 will receive the service packet from protection path(P-
   shared path-L1,L2).but the leaf nodes(L2,L3) of the working path 2
   will still receive the service packet from their working path 2. .

3.3.   Conclusion

   The two types of p2mp protection solution will individually implement
   1:n and (1:1)^n protection for p2mp service.  They can fulfill the
   requirement of unidirectional p2mp protection and sharing protection
   resource. .




4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the authentication TLV need further
   study.


5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
