                    draft-hallambaker-tlsfeature-02

Abstract

   The purpose of the TLS Feature extension is to prevent downgrade
   attacks that are not otherwise prevented by the TLS protocol.  In
   particular, the TLS Feature extension may be used to mandate support
   for revocation checking features in the TLS protocol such as OCSP
   stapling.  Informing clients that an OCSP status response will always
   be stapled permits an immediate failure in the case that the response
   is not stapled.  This in turn prevents a denial of service attack
   that might otherwise be possible.

1.2.  TLS Feature

   In order to avoid the confusion that would occur in attempting to
   describe an X.509 extension describing the use of TLS extensions, in
   this document the term 'extension' is reserved to refer to X.509v3
   extensions and the term 'feature' is used to refer to a TLS
   extension.

   The purpose of the TLS Feature extension is to prevent downgrade
   attacks that are not otherwise prevented by the TLS protocol.

   Since the TLS protocol itself provides strong protection against most
   forms of downgrade attack including downgrade attacks against cipher
   suite choices offered and client credentials, the TLS Feature is only
   relevant to the validation of TLS protocol credentials.  In
   particular to the revocation status of the server credentials
   presented.

   At the time of writing, the only TLS feature extensions that are
   relevant to the revocation status of credentials is the Certificate
   Status Request extension (status_request) Multiple Certificate Status
   Extension (status_request_v2) These extensions are used to support
   in-band exchange of OCSP tokens, otherwise known as OCSP stapling.
   These extensions are described in [RFC6066] and [draft-pettersen-tls-
   ext-multiple-ocsp-03].

   The OCSP stapling mechanism described in [RFC6066] permits a TLS
   server to provide evidence of valid certificate status inband.  When
   this information is provided inband, the privacy, performance and
   reliability concerns arising from the need to make a third party
   connection during the TLS handshake are eliminated.  A client cannot
   however draw any conclusion from the absence of inband status
   information unless it knows that the legitimate server would have
   provided it.  The status information might have been omitted because
   the server does not support the extension or because the server is
   witholding the information intentionally, knowing the certificate to
   be invalid.

   The inclusion of a TLS feature extension advertising the
   status_request feature in the server end entity certificate permits a
   client to fail immediately if the certificate status information is
   not provided by the server.  The need to query the OCSP responder is
   eliminated entirely.  This improves client efficiency and more
   importantly prevents a denial of service attack against the client by
   either blocking the OCSP response or mounting a denial of service
   attack against the OCSP responder.

   Since the TLS Feature extension is an option, it is not likely that
   an attacker attempting to obtain a certificate through fraud will
   choose to have a certificate issued with this extension.  Such risks
   are more approrpriately addressed by mechanisms such as Certificate
   Authority Authorization DNS records RFC 6844 [RFC6844] that are
   designed to prevent or mitigate mis-issue.  Nevertheless a
   Certification Authority MAY consider the presence or absence of a
   required TLS feature as one factor in determining the level of
   additional scruitiny a request should be subject to.

Internet-Draft       X.509v3 TLS Feature Extension            April 2013


   A server offering an end entity certificate with a TLS feature
   extension MUST satisfy a client request for the specified feature
   unless this would be redundant as described below.  Otherwise clients
   MAY refuse connection.  It is important therefore that a
   Certification Authority only issue certificates that specify features
   that match the configuration of the server and that the server is
   capable of verifying that its configuration is compatible with the
   feature declaration of the certificates it offers.  Ideally, the TLS
   feature declaration would be specified by the certificate request
   generator as part of the certificate issue process.

   A client feature request is redundant if the purpose of the request
   is fully satisfied by another feature.  For example, a server need
   not satisfy a client request for the status_request feature if the
   status_request_v2 is offered and satisfied.

   In the case that the cached_information feature is offered and
   satisfied, a client request for the status_request or
   status_request_v2 features is satisfied if and only if the cached
   credentials referenced include the OCSP status information necessary
   to establish the certificate status.

   This document describes the use of the TLS feature in PKIX end entity
   and certificate signing certificate and a mechanism that MAY be used
   to describe support for the specified features in-band for the most
   commonly used certificate registration protocol.

3.  Syntax

   The TLS Feature extension has the following format:

   tls-feature OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { id-pe  1 }

   Features ::= SEQUENCE OF INTEGER


   The TLS Feature Extension SHOULD NOT be marked critical.  RFC 5280
   [RFC5280] requires that implementations that do not understand the
   extension MUST reject the certificate.  Marking the TLS Feature
   Extension critical breaks backward compatibility and is not
   recommended unless this is the desired behavior.  Implementations
   that process the extension MUST ignore the criticality bit setting.

Internet-Draft       X.509v3 TLS Feature Extension            April 2013


3.1.  TLS Feature

   The TLS Feature extension lists a sequence of TLS extension
   identifiers (features) that a TLS server compliant with the feature
   declaration MUST support and satisfy on client request.

   This specification does not require a TLS client to offer or support
   any TLS feature regardless of whether it is specified in the server
   certificate's TLS Feature extension or not.  In particular a client
   MAY request and a server MAY support any TLS extension regardless of
   whether it is specified in a TLS Feature extension or not.

   If a TLS Feature extension specifies a TLS feature, a server offering
   the certificate MUST support the extension specified and MUST comply
   with any specific requirements specified for that feature in this
   document or in the document that specifies the TLS feature.

3.1.1.  status_request

   If the TLS status_request feature is specified in the TLS Feature
   extension and a TLS client specifies the status_request feature in
   the Client Hello, a server MUST return a valid OCSP token for the
   specified server's End Entity certificate in the response.

3.2.  Use

3.2.1.  Certificate Signing Request

   If the certificate issue mechanism makes use of the PKCS#10
   Certificate Signing Request (CSR) [RFC2986], the CSR MAY specify a
   TLS Feature extension as a CSR attribute.  A server or server
   administration tool should only generate key signing requests that it
   knows can be supported by the server for which the certificate is
   intended.

3.2.2.  Certificate Signing Certificate

   When present in a Certificate Signing Certificate (i.e., CA
   certificate with the key usage extension value set to keyCertSign),
   the TLS Feature extension specifies a constraint on valid certificate
   chains.  Specifically, a certificate that is signed by a Certificate
   Signing Certificate that contains a TLS Feature extension MUST
   contain a TLS Feature extension which MUST offer the same set or a
   superset of the features advertised in the signing certificate.

   While relying parites (i.e., clients) MAY reject certificates that do
   not comply with this requirement, the use of TLS Feature extension in
   Certificate Signing Certificates is primarily intended for use by

   parties seeking to evaluate the performance of certificate issuers
   and MAY be ignored by clients.

3.2.3.  End Entity Certificate

   When specified in a server End Entity Certificate (i.e.  a
   certificate that specifies the id-kp-server EKU), the TLS Feature
   extension specifies criteria that a server MUST meet to be compliant
   with the feature declaration.

   In the case that a client determines that the server configuration is
   inconsistent with the specified feature declaration it MAY reject the
   TLS configuration.

   In the case that a client determines that the server configuration is
   inconsistent with a feature declaration specifying support for the
   TLS status_request extension it SHOULD reject the TLS configuration.

3.3.  Processing

3.3.1.  Certification Authority

   A CA SHOULD NOT issue certs with a TLS Feature extension unless there
   is an affirmative statement to the effect that the end entity intends
   to support the specified features.  For example the use of a Feature
   extension in the CSR or through an out of band communication.

3.3.2.  Server

   A TLS server certificate containing a TLS Feature extension MAY be
   used with any TLS server that supports the specified features.  It is
   not necessary for the server to provide support for the TLS Feature
   extension itself.  Such support is nevertheless desirable as it can
   reduce the risk of administrative error.

   A server SHOULD verify that its configuration is compatible with the
   TLS Feature extension expressed in a certificate it presents.  A
   server MAY override local configuration options if necessary to
   ensure consistency but SHOULD inform the administrator whenever such
   an inconsitency is discovered.

   A server SHOULD support generation of the Feature extension in CSRs
   if key generation is supported.

3.3.3.  Client

   A compliant client SHOULD reject a TLS connection with security
   properties that are inconsistent with the specified TLS Feature

   extension.  A compliant client MAY accept such a TLS connection
   request however if it is determined that doing so is appropriate in
   particular circumstances.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Alternative Certificates and Certificate Issuers

   Use of the TLS Feature extension to mandate support for a particular
   form of revocation checking is optional.  This control can provide
   protection in the case that a certificate with a TLS Feature is
   compromised after issue but not in the case that the attacker obtains
   an unmarked certificate from an issuer through fraud.

   The TLS Feature extension is a post-issue security control.  Such
   risks can only be addressed by security controls that take effect
   before issue.

5.2.  Denial of Service

   A certificate Issuer could issue a certificate that intentionally
   specified a feature statement that they knew the server could not
   support.

   The risks of such refusal would appear to be negligible since a
   Certificate Authority could equally refuse to issue the certificate.

5.3.  Cipher Suite Downgrade Attack

   The TLS Feature extension does not provide protection against a
   cipher suite downgrade attack.  This is left to the existing controls
   in the TLS protocol itself.

6.  IANA Considerations

   No action by IANA is required.
