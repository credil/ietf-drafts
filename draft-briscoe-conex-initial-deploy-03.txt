Internet-Draft      Initial ConEx Deployment Examples          July 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document gives examples of how ConEx deployment might get
   started, focusing on unilateral deployment by a single network.

2.  Recap: Incremental Deployment Features of the ConEx Protocol

   The ConEx mechanism document [conex-abstract-mech] goes to great
   lengths to design for incremental deployment in all the respects
   below.  It should be referred to for precise details on each of these
   points:

   o  The ConEx mechanism is essentially a change to the source, in
      order to re-insert congestion feedback into the network.

   o  Source-host-only deployment is possible without any negotiation
      required, and individual transport protocol implementations within
      a source host can be updated separately.

   o  Receiver modification may optionally improve ConEx for some
      transport protocols with feedback limitations (TCP being the main
      example), but it is not a necessity

   o  Proxies for the source and/or receiver are feasible (though not
      necessarily straightforward)

   o  Queues and network forwarding do not require any modification for
      ConEx.

   o  ECN is not required in the network for ConEx.  If some network
      nodes support ECN, it can be used by ConEx.

   o  ECN is not required at the receiver for ConEx.  The sender should
      nonetheless attempt to negotiate ECN-usage with the receiver,
      given some aspects of ConEx work better the more ECN is deployed,
      particularly auditing and border measurement.

   o  Given ConEx exposes information for IP-layer policy devices to
      use, the design does not preclude possible innovative uses of
      ConEx information by other IP-layer devices, e.g. forwarding
      itself

   o  Packets indicate whether or not they support ConEx.

3.  ConEx Components

3.1.  Recap of Basic ConEx Components

   [conex-abstract-mech] introduces the following components:

   o  The ConEx Wire Protocol (currently only specified for IPv6
      [conex-destopt], although a possible way to fit ConEx into the
      IPv4 header has been described [intarea-ipv4-id-reuse])

   o  Forwarding devices (unmodified)

   o  Sender (modified for ConEx)

   o  Receiver (optionally modified)

   o  Audit

   o  Policy Devices:

      *  Rest-of-Path Congestion Monitoring Devices (using information
         from the ConEx wire protocol)

      *  Congestion Policers (using rest-of-path congestion monitoring)

   [conex-abstract-mech] should be referred to for definitions of each
   of these components and further explanation.

   The goal of all these ConEx elements for this scenario is to expose
   information about congestion on the whole-path to a congestion-
   policer.  A congestion-policer is nearly identical to a traditional
   token-bucket-based bit-rate policer except the tokens it fills with
   arrive at a rate that represents the volume of congestion that the
   customer is allowed to contribute to over time and tokens drain from
   the bucket at a rate dependent on the ConEx signals representing
   rest-of-path congestion.  [CongPol] introduces congestion-policing
   and [conex-concepts-uses] explains the benefits of policing based on
   congestion-volume compared to methods like weighted round-robin
   traditionally used in a BRAS.

3.2.  Per-Network Deployment Concepts

   Network deployment-related definitions:

   Internet Ingress:  The first IP node a packet traverses that is
      outside the source's own network.  In a residential access network
      scenario, for traffic from a home this is the first IP-aware node
      after the home access equipment.  For Internet access from an

Internet-Draft      Initial ConEx Deployment Examples          July 2012


      enterprise network this is the provider edge router.

   Internet Egress:  The last IP node a packet traverses before reaching
      the receiver's network.

   ConEx-Enabled Network:  A network whose edge nodes implement ConEx
      policy functions.

   Each network can unilaterally choose to use any ConEx information
   given by those sources using ConEx, independently of whether other
   networks use it.

   Typically, a network will use ConEx information by deploying a policy
   function at the ingress edge of its network to monitor arriving
   traffic and to act in some way on the congestion information in those
   packets that are ConEx-enabled.  Actions might include policing,
   altering the class of service, or re-routing.  Alternatively, less
   direct actions via a management system might include triggering
   capacity upgrades, triggering penalty clauses in contracts or levying
   charges between networks based on ConEx measurements.

   Typically, a network using ConEx info will deploy a ConEx policy
   function near the ingress edge and a ConEx audit function near the
   egress edge.  The segment of the path between a ConEx policy function
   and a ConEx audit function can be considered to be a ConEx-protected
   segment of the path.  Assuming a network covers all its ingresses and
   egresses with policy functions and audit functions respectively, the
   network within this ring will be a ConEx-protected network.

   Of course, because each edge device usually serves as both an ingress
   and an egress, the two functions are both likely to be present in
   each edge device.

4.  Example Initial Deployment Arrangements

   In all the deployment scenarios below, we assume that deployment
   starts with some data sources being modified with ConEx code.  The
   rationale for this is that the developer of a scavenger transport
   protocol like LEDBAT has a strong incentive to tell the network how
   little congestion it is causing despite sending large volumes of
   data.  In this case the developer makes the first move expecting it
   will prompt at least some networks to move in response--so that they
   use the ConEx information to reward users of the scavenger protocol.

4.1.  Single Receiving Network Scenario

   The name 'Receiving Network' for this scenario merely emphasises that
   most data is arriving from connected networks and data centres and

   being consumed by residential customers on this access network.  Some
   data is of course also travelling in the other direction.

                Figure 1: Single Receiving Network Scenario

   Figure Figure 1 is an attempt to show the salient features of a ConEx
   deployment in a typical broadband access provider's network (within
   the constraints of ASCII art).  Broadband remote access servers
   (BRASs) control access to the core network from the access network
   and vice versa.  Home networks (and small businesses) connect to the
   access network, but only two are shown.

   In this diagram, all data is travelling towards the access network of
   Home-b, from the Peer network, the Data centre, the CDN and Home-a.
   Data actually travels in both directions on all links, but only one
   direction is shown.

   The data centre, core and access network are all run by the same
   network operator, but each is the responsibility of a different
   department with internal accounting between them.  The content
   distribution network (CDN) is operated by a third party CDN provider,
   and of course the peer network is also operated by a third party.

   This operator of the data centre, core and access network is the only
   one in the diagram to have deployed ConEx monitoring and policy
   devices at the edges of its network.  However, it has not enabled ECN
   on any of its network elements and neither has any other network in

   the diagram.  The operator has deployed a congestion policing
   function (P) on the provider-edge router where the peer attaches to
   its core, on the BRAS where the CDN attaches and on the other BRAS
   where each of the residential customers like Home-a attach.  On the
   provider-edge router where the data centre attaches it has deployed a
   congestion monitoring function (M).  Each of these policing and
   monitoring functions handles the aggregate of all traffic traversing
   it, for all destinations.

   The operator has deployed an audit function on each logical output
   port of the BRAS for each end-customer site like Home-b.  The Audit
   function handles the aggregate of all traffic for that end-customer
   from all sources.  For traffic in the opposite direction (e.g. from
   Home-b to Home-a, there would be equivalent policing (P) and audit
   (A) functions in the converse locations to those shown.

   Some content sources in the CDN and in the data centre are using the
   ConEx protocol, but others are not.  There is a similar situation for
   hosts attached to the Peer network and hosts in home networks like
   Home-a: some are sending ConEx packets at least for bulk data
   transports, while others are not.

4.1.1.  ConEx Functions in the Single Receiving Network Scenario

   Within the BRAS there are logical ports that model the rate of each
   access line from the DSLAM to each home network [TR-059], [TR-101].
   They are fed by a shared queue that models the rate of the downstream
   link from the BRAS to the DSLAM (sometimes called the backhaul
   network).  If there is congestion anywhere in the set of networks in
   Figure Figure 1 it is nearly always:

   o  either self-congestion in the queues into the logical ports
      representing the access lines

   o  or shared congestion in the shared queue on the BRAS that feeds
      them.

   Any ConEx sources sending data through this BRAS will receive
   feedback about these losses from the destination and re-insert it as
   ConEx markings into the data.  Figure 2 shows an example plot of the
   loss levels that might be seen at different monitoring points along a
   path between the data centre and home-b, for instance.  The top half
   of the figure shows the loss probability within the BRAS consists of
   0.1% at the shared queue and 0.2% self-congestion in the logical
   output port that models the access line, making 0.3% in total.  This
   upper diagram also shows whole path congestion as signalled by the
   ConEx sender, which remains unchanged along the whole path at 0.3%.

Internet-Draft      Initial ConEx Deployment Examples          July 2012


   The lower half of the figure shows (downstream congestion) = (whole
   path) - (upstream congestion).  Upstream congestion can only be
   monitored locally where the loss actually happens (within the BRAS
   output queues).  Nonetheless, given there is rarely loss anywhere
   else but within the BRAS, this limitation is not significant in this
   scenario.  The lower half of the figure also shows the location of
   the policing and audit functions.  Policing anywhere within or
   upstream ofthe BRAS will be based on the downstream congestion level
   of 0.3%.  While Auditing within the BRAS but after all the queues can
   check that the whole path congestion signalled by ConEx is no less
   than the loss levels experienced within the BRAS itself.

4.1.2.  Incentives to Unilaterally Deploy ConEx in a Receiving Network

   Even a sending application that is modified to use ConEx can choose
   whether to send ConEx or Not-ConEx packets.  Nonetheless, ConEx
   packets bring information to a policer about congestion expected on
   the rest of the path beyond the policer.  Not-ConEx packets bring no
   such information.  Therefore a network that has deployed ConEx
   policers will tend to rate-limit not-ConEx packets conservatively in



Briscoe                 Expires January 17, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      Initial ConEx Deployment Examples          July 2012


   order to manage the unknown risk of congestion.  In contrast, a
   network doesn't normally need to rate-limit ConEx-enabled packets
   unless they reveal a persistently high contribution to congestion.
   This natural tendency for networks to favour senders that provide
   ConEx information encourages senders to choose to use the ConEx
   protocol whenever they can.

   In particular, high volume sources have the most incentive to deploy
   ConEx.  This is because high volume sources (e.g. video download
   sites or peer-to-peer file-sharing) can gain by implementing a low
   'weight' end-to-end transport (i.e. a less aggressive response to
   congestion than other transports).  Then, although they send a large
   amount of volume, they need not contribute significantly to
   congestion.  If the ISP currently limits data volume, or offers
   chargeable tiers based on data volume, such customers stand to gain
   considerably if they can encourage the ISP to limit usage based on
   congestion-volume instead of volume.

   Figure 3 explains why this is the case.  The plots show bit-rate on
   the vertical axis and time horizontally.  A file transfer (e.g. the
   one labelled from customer 'b') is given a simplified representation
   as a rectangle, implying it runs at a set rate for a time, then
   completes.  The maximum height of each plot represents the maximum
   capacity of the shared link across the backhaul network, which is
   typically the bottleneck in a broadband network.  The hatched regions
   represent unused capacity. 'c' represents the high volume source that
   we intend to show has an incentive to deploy ConEx.

   In the upper half of the figure, customers 'b' & 'c' both use
   transports with equal weights, which is why they are shown with equal
   rates when they both compete for the capacity of the line. 'c' sends
   larger files than 'b', so when 'b' completes each of its file, 'c'
   can use the full capacity of the line until 'b' starts the next file.
   In the lower half of the figure, 'c' uses a less aggressive (lower
   weight) transport, so whenever 'b' sends a file, 'c' yields more of
   its rate.  This allows 'b' to complete its transfer earlier, so that
   'c' can take up the full rate earlier. 'b' sends the same volume
   files (same area in the graph), just faster and therefore they
   complete sooner (tall & thin instead of shorter and wider).  As a
   result, 'c' hardly finishes any later than in the upper diagram.
   However, 'c' will have contributed much less to congestion, and 'b'
   completes the majority of its file transfers much faster. 'b' has
   also contributed less to congestion.

   As we have said, customer 'c' in particular stands to gain if the ISP
   bases usage-limits (or usage charges) on congestion-volume rather
   than volume.  The ISP also has a strong incentive to reward customers
   like 'c', because they make the network performance appear far better

   than before for customer's like 'b' (e.g. short Web transfers).
   However, the network cannot make this move until customers like 'c'
   expose congestion information (ConEx) that the ISP can use in its
   traffic management or contracts.

   Of course, in reality there would be more than two customers.  But
   this would mean that short transfers like 'b' stand to gain even
   more, as multiple larger files would be yielding at once.

   We should point out that not all high-volume customers will be
   prepared to temporarily shift their usage out of the way as shown --
   real-time video for instance would still use a higher weight (more
   aggressive) so as to ensure timely delivery.  However, high volume
   applications with elastic (non-real-time) requirements are also
   common (e.g. video streaming, software downloads, etc)

   We should also point out that a transport that is less agressive
   against other customers is similar but not quite the same as LEDBAT
   [ledbat-congestion].  LEDBAT does indeed yield more to other flows
   during congestion, but it is designed to only do this if the
   contention for resources is at a slow link, such as the customer's
   own home router.  If the contention is at a fast link, such as a
   BRAS, LEDBAT is designed not to yield.  This is because ISPs

   currently give no reward to a transport that minimises congestion to
   others -- because they do not have the congestion information to be
   able to.

   This document does not require actions by IANA.

7.  Conclusions

   This document has introduced how congestion policing could be
   deployed at the broadband remote access servers in a typical
   broadband access network.  Congestion policing uses ConEx markings
   introduced by data sources and packets discarded by the BRAS to
   determine rest-of-path congestion, and police traffic accordingly.

   It has been shown that high-volume elastic data sources have a strong
   incentive to deploy ConEx speculatively in the expectation that they
   will be able to encourage their ISPs to account for their usage by
   congestion-volume, not volume.  They can use a less aggressive
   transport and prove that they are contributing little to congestion
   despite sending a lot of volume.  ISPs also have a strong incentive
   to use this ConEx information to encourage their elastic high-volume
   customers to use less agressive transports, given they improve the
   performance of all the other customers.

   Without ConEx information, ISPs can only use volume as a metric of
   usage, which prevents the above virtuous circle from forming,
   perversely discouraging high-volume elastic customers from such
   friendly behaviour.

Appendix A.  Summary of Changes between Drafts

   Detailed changes are available from
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-briscoe-conex-initial-deploy

   From draft-briscoe-02 to draft-briscoe-03:

      *  Removed Mobile and Data Centre scenarios, making this draft
         solely cover the receiving access network scenario.  It then
         becomes a 'sibling' of the drafts on these two subjects, rather
         than a 'parent'
