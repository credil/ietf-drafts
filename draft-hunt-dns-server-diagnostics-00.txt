            The DNS Extended Server Diagnostics (ESD) Option
                  draft-hunt-dns-server-diagnostics-00

Abstract

   The widespread adoption of DNSSEC implies more frequent DNSSEC
   failures.  Unfortunately, DNSSEC's failure mode is largely opaque to
   the client: when validation fails, the only signal that the clients
   of a validating resolver receive is an empty response with a SERVFAIL
   response code.  This note proposes a protocol extension to allow
   SERVFAIL responses to include additional diagnostic information,
   giving the client greater insight into what went wrong and a better
   chance of delivering useful problem reports to DNS operators.

1.  Introduction

   DNSSEC's failure mode is largely opaque to the client: when
   validation fails, the only signal of this that a resolver's clients
   receive is a SERVFAIL response code.

   With no information provided to explain the exact cause of a SERVFAIL
   response, there is no straightforward way for an end user to
   determine whether a failure occurred due to a broken local resolver,
   a zone misconfiguration such as expired signatures, or a spoofing
   attack.  This makes it difficult to address complaints and problem
   reports to the right people, slowing the correction of DNSSEC errors
   while increasing the support burden on validating resolver operators.

   This note proposes a protocol extension allowing a name server, upon
   request from a client, to accompany SERVFAIL responses with detailed
   diagnostic information indicating what specifically caused the
   failure.  In the typical use case for this mechanism, a validating
   caching name server would be able to convey specific failure
   information to a non-validating stub resolver or other client.

1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Protocol

   A DNS client such as a non-validating stub resolver may use an
   EDNS(0) [RFC2671] option, ESD, to solicit extended diagnostic
   information from a DNS server.  The ESD option payload includes a 16-
   bit "flags" field and a 16-bit diagnostic code; additional payload
   data may be included in the response.

   One bit in the "flags" field is defined as "human-readable": if this
   bit is set in the solicitation, it indicates a desire for the server
   to return human-readable text, in addition to machine-readable
   diagnostic data; this text can be displayed or sent to a logging
   facility such as syslog [RFC5424].  All other payload data MUST be
   left empty in the solicitation.

   The response payload, in addition to the flags field and the
   diagnostic code, may also include a supplemental data field whose
   content and schema are dependent on the diagnostic code being
   returned.  If the "human-readable" flag is set in the response, then
   the response also includes human-readable text in a counted string,



Hunt                    Expires February 1, 2014                [Page 3]

   i.e., a single length octet followed by that number of characters, as
   in the TXT RDATA format [RFC1035].

2.1.  Client Behavior

   A stub resolver or other DNS client requests extended diagnostic data
   by sending an ESD option (Section 2.3) in an EDNS(0) OPT pseudo-RR in
   the query message.  The requestor MAY set the "human-readable" bit in
   the flags field of the request payload.  The requestor MUST NOT
   include any other payload data in the ESD option.

   The requestor MUST ignore any ESD option included in a response that
   does not have response code SERVFAIL.

2.2.  Server Behavior

   A resolver or other name server which encounters a server failure
   while answering a query that included an ESD option MAY add an ESD
   option to the SERVFAIL response.  If the query did not include an ESD
   option, then the response MUST NOT include one.  The server MUST NOT
   include an ESD option in any non-SERVFAIL response.

2.3.  The ESD Option

   The OPTION-CODE for the ESD option is [TBD].

   The format for the OPTION-DATA portion of an ESD option is shown
   below:

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |            FLAGS            |H|           DIAGCODE            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   \                  HRTEXT (optional, resonse only)              \
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   \                 SUPPDATA (optional, response only)            \
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   in which the fields are defined as follows:

   FLAGS     A 16-bit field.  Bit 15 (H) is defined to mean "human-
             readable"; when set in the solicitation, this bit signals a
             desire for human-readable text to be included in the
             response; when set in the response, it signals that such
             text has been included.  All other bits in the field MUST
             be set to zero.

Internet-Draft           dns-server-diagnostics                July 2013


   DIAGCODE  A 16-bit diagnostic code (Section 2.4) indicating the
             reason for the SERVFAIL response.  In the solicitation
             payload, this field MUST be set to zero.

   HRTEXT    An counted string, containing human-readable text suitable
             for logging.  The first octet defines the length of the
             following text; if the first octet contains 0, the string
             is emty.  This is intended as an opaque string to be passed
             through to a logging mechanism; content and encoding are
             outside the scope of the protocol.  This field MUST NOT be
             included in a solicitation payload.

   SUPPDATA  Optional supplementary data about the cause of the server
             failure.  The presence or absence, content, and schema of
             this field are entirely dependent on the diagnostic code
             being returned in the DIAGCODE field (Section 2.4).  This
             field MUST NOT be included in a solicitation payload.

2.4.  ESD Diagnostic Codes

   Diagnostic codes are grouped in five general categories: Internal
   server error conditions (diagnostic codes 1-255), general DNS
   failures (256-511), policy-dependent security errors (512-767),
   temporary security errors (768-1023), and fatal security errors
   (1024-1279).  Space has been reserved in the namespace for additional
   categories and codes.  All diagnostic codes are optional; there is no
   requiremnt to impelement all of them.

   The DIAGCODE field MUST be set to zero (No Error) in ESD
   solicitations.

2.4.1.  Internal Server Errors

   These diagnostic codes indicate a system failure in the responding
   server.

2.4.1.1.  Internal Error, Not Otherwise Specified

   Diagnostic code 1 indicates an unspecified internal server error
   unrelated to DNSSEC.  A server MAY return this code in place of any
   other internal server error, at the discretion of the implementor or
   operator, if information about the internal state of the server is
   regarded as security sensitive.  This code has no supplemental data.

2.4.1.2.  Out of Memory

   Diagnostic code 2 indicates that the server was not able to
   dynamically allocate memory.  This code has no supplemental data.

2.4.1.5.  Invalid Zone

   Diagnostic code 5: The server has been configured to be authoritative
   for a zone which is an ancestor of the query name, but the zone
   contents are invalid; for example, there is no SOA RR or NS RRset at
   the zone apex.  The supplemental data contains the name of the zone
   in DNS wire format.

2.4.1.6.  Configuration Error

   Diagnostic code 7: Query processing timed out.  This code has no
   supplemental data.

2.4.1.8.  Shutting Down

   Diagnostic code 8: The server is shutting down.  This code has no
   supplemental data.

2.4.2.  General DNS Errors

   These codes describe failure conditions due to bad or inconsistent
   data in the DNS not specifically related to DNSSEC.

2.4.2.1.  Lame Delegation

   Diagnostic code 256: The name servers which have been delegated
   responsibility for a zone cannot be reached or are not performing
   name service for that zone.  The supplemental data contains the zone
   apex name of the faulty zone.

2.4.5.17.  Key Revoked

   Diagnostic code 1040: A key that is required to complete a chain of
   trust has its REVOKED bit [RFC5011] set.  The supplemental data
   contains the name and tag of the revoked key, in the format specified
   in Section 2.4.3.1.


3.  Security Considerations

   An ESD option response contains channel diagnostic data, to be used
   for logging, troubleshooting, and debugging; it falls outside the
   scope of DNSSEC per se.  Ensuring integrity of the response requires
   the use of a channel security mechanism such as TSIG [RFC2845] or
   SIG(0) [RFC2931].  In the absence of any such mechanism, ESD
   responses MUST NOT be used by clients to make policy decisions with
   respect to DNSSEC validation, as this could allow an attacker to
   force a security downgrade or denial of service by forging SERVFAIL
   messages containing particular ESD responses.

   Some of the data in an ESD option response may be security sensitive,
   particularly those responses which increase the transparency of the
   current state of a running resolver.  In the case of SERVFAIL
   responses due to authoritative server misconfiguration or other non-
   local conditions, this is generally not a concern, as the data which

   caused the failure are readily available in the DNS and can be
   obtained by other means.  However, information about server failures
   due to local problems such as out-of-memory conditions may be of
   tactical use to an attacker.  Implementors may wish to provide a
   mechanism for operators to disable certain types of diagnostic
   response while allowing others.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to make the assignments in this section.

4.1.  ESD Option Code

   This document requests the allocation of an EDNS(0) option code for
   the ESD option, whose value is [TBD].

4.2.  Diagnostic Codes

   This document requests the creation of a new registry of ESD
   diagnostic codes.  The registry policy is "Specification Required"
   [RFC5226].  The initial entries in the registry are:
