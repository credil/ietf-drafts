Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
   objects for managing an RBridge (Routing Bridge), also known as a
   TRILL Switch, based on the IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of
   Lots of Links) protocol.

Internet-Draft          RBridges: TRILL Base MIB        December 3, 2012


1. Introduction

   This document describes a model for managing RBridges (Routing
   Bridges), also known as TRILL Switches, as defined in [RFC6325]. 
   RBridges provide optimal pair-wise forwarding without configuration
   using IS-IS routing and encapsulation of traffic. RBridges are
   compatible with previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges as well as IPv4
   and IPv6 routers and end nodes.  They are as invisible to current IP
   routers as bridges are and, like routers, they terminate the bridge
   spanning tree protocol.  In creating an RBridge management model the
   device is viewed primarily as a customer bridge. For a discussion of
   the problem addressed by TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots
   of Links) see [RFC5556].

   RBridges support features specified for transparent bridges in IEEE
   802.1, and the corresponding MIB modules are used to manage those
   features. For IS-IS purposes, the corresponding MIB module is used to
   manage the protocol. This MIB module specifies those objects which
   are TRILL-specific and hence not available in other MIB modules.

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   which consists of [RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580].

3. Overview

   The RBridge MIB module is intended as an overall framework for
   managing RBridges, also known as TRILL Switches. Where possible the
   MIB references existing MIB definitions in order to maximize reuse. 
   This results in a considerable emphasis on the relationship with
   other MIB modules.

   Starting with the physical interfaces, there are requirements for
   certain elements of the IF-MIB to be implemented.  These elements are
   required in order to connect the per-port parameters to higher level
   functions of the physical device.

   Transparent bridging, VLANs, Traffic classes and Multicast Filtering

Internet-Draft          RBridges: TRILL Base MIB        December 3, 2012


   are supported by the TRILL protocol, and the corresponding management
   is expected to conform to the BRIDGE-MIB [RFC4188], P-BRIDGE-MIB and
   Q-BRIDGE-MIB [RFC4363] modules. 

   The IS-IS routing protocol is used in order to determine the optimum
   pair-wise forwarding path.  This protocol is managed using the IS-IS
   MIB module defined in [RFC4444].  Since the TRILL protocol specifies
   use of a single level and a fixed area address of zero, some IS-IS
   MIB objects are not applicable.  Some IS-IS MIB objects are used in
   the TRILL protocol.

4. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

5. Structure of the MIB Module

   Objects in this MIB module are arranged into subtrees.  Each subtree
   is organized as a set of related objects.  The various subtrees are
   shown below. These are supplemented with required elements of the IF-
   MIB, ISIS-MIB, BRIDGE-MIB, P-BRIDGE-MIB, Q-BRIDGE-MIB and IEEE Bridge
   MIB modules.

5.1 Textual Conventions

   Textual conventions are defined to represent object types relevant to
   TRILL.

5.2 The rbridgeBase Subtree

   This subtree contains system and port specific objects applicable to
   all RBridges.

5.3 The rbridgeFdb Subtree

   This subtree contains objects applicable to the Forwarding database
   used by the RBridge in making packet forwarding decisions. Because it
   contains additional information used by the TRILL protocol not
   applicable to 802.1D/Q bridges, it is a superset of the corresponding
   subtrees defined in the BRIDGE-MIB and Q-BRIDGE-MIB.

5.4 The rbridgeVlan subtree

   This subtree describes objects applicable to VLANs configured on the
   RBridge.

Internet-Draft          RBridges: TRILL Base MIB        December 3, 2012


5.5 The rbridgeEsadi subtree

   This subtree describes objects relevant to RBridges that support the
   optional ESADI protocol.

5.6 The rbridgeCounters subtree

   This subtree contains statistics maintained by RBridges that can aid
   in monitoring and troubleshooting networks connected by them.

5.7 The rbridgeSnooping subtree

   This subtree describes objects applicable to RBridges capable of
   snooping IPv4 and/or IPv6 Multicast control frames and pruning IP
   multicast traffic based on detection of IP multicast routers and
   listeners.

5.8 The rbridgeDtree subtree

   This subtree contains objects relevant to Distribution Trees computed
   by RBridges for the forwarding of multi-destination frames.

5.9 The rbridgeTrill subtree

   This subtree contains objects applicable to the TRILL IS-IS protocol,
   beyond what is available in ISIS-MIB.

5.10 The Notifications Subtree

   The defined notifications are focused on the TRILL protocol
   functionality.  Notifications are defined for changes in the
   Designated RBridge status and the topology.


6. Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   The IF-MIB, BRIDGE-MIB, P-BRIDGE-MIB, Q-BRIDGE-MIB, IEEE8021-BRIDGE-
   MIB, IEEE8021-Q-BRIDGE-MIB and ISIS-MIB modules all contain objects
   relevant to the RBridge MIB. Management objects contained in these
   modules are not duplicated here, to reduce overlap to the extent
   possible.

   The Bridge MIB modules were originally written in the IETF, and
   implemented by many vendors. Per [RFC4663], this has recently been
   transferred to the IEEE 802.1 group. As vendors may have implemented
   either the IETF or IEEE Bridge MIB modules, this RBridge MIB module
   is designed to work with either one.

Internet-Draft          RBridges: TRILL Base MIB        December 3, 2012


6.1 Relationship to IF-MIB

   The port identification elements MUST be implemented in order to
   allow them to be cross referenced.  The Interface MIB [RFC2863]
   requires that any MIB module which is an adjunct of the Interface MIB
   clarify specific areas within the Interface MIB module.  These areas
   were intentionally left vague in the Interface MIB module to avoid
   over-constraining the MIB, thereby precluding management of certain
   media types.  Section 4 of [RFC2863] enumerates several areas which a
   media-specific MIB module must clarify.  The implementor is referred
   to [RFC2863] in order to understand the general intent of these
   areas.

6.2 Relationship to BRIDGE-MIB

   The following subtrees in the BRIDGE-MIB [RFC4188] contain
   information relevant to RBridges when the corresponding functionality
   is implemented.

   o dot1dBase
   o dot1dTp
   o dot1dStatic

6.3 Relationship to P-BRIDGE-MIB

   The following subtrees in the P-BRIDGE-MIB [RFC4363] contain
   information relevant to RBridges when the corresponding functionality
   is implemented.

   o dot1dExtBase
   o dot1dPriority
   o dot1dGarp
   o dot1dGmrp
   o dot1dTpHCPortTable
   o dot1dTpPortOverflowTable

6.4 Relationship to Q-BRIDGE-MIB

   The following groups in the Q-BRIDGE-MIB [RFC4363] contain
   information relevant to RBridges when the corresponding functionality
   is implemented. This functionality is also contained in IEEE8021-Q-
   BRIDGE-MIB.

   o dot1qBase
   o dot1qTp
   o dot1qStatic
   o dot1qVlan
   o dot1vProtocol

Internet-Draft          RBridges: TRILL Base MIB        December 3, 2012


6.5 Relationship to IEEE8021-BRIDGE-MIB

   The following subtrees in the IEEE8021-BRIDGE-MIB contain information
   relevant to RBridges when the corresponding functionality is
   implemented.

   o ieee8021BridgeBase
   o ieee8021BridgeTp
   o ieee8021BridgePriority
   o ieee8021BridgeMrp
   o ieee8021BridgeMmrp
   o ieee8021BridgeInternalLan
   o ieee8021BridgeDot1d

   6.6 Relationship to IEEE8021-Q-BRIDGE-MIB

   The following subtrees in the IEEE8021-Q-BRIDGE-MIB contain
   information relevant to RBridges when the corresponding functionality
   is implemented.

   o ieee8021QBridgeBase
   o ieee8021QBridgeTp
   o ieee8021QBridgeStatic
   o ieee8021QBridgeVlan
   o ieee8021QBridgeProtocol

6.7 Relationship to ISIS-MIB

   The Management Information Base for Intermediate System to
   Intermediate System (IS-IS)[RFC4444] defines a MIB module for the IS-
   IS Routing protocol when it is used to construct routing tables for
   IP networks.  While most of these objects are applicable to the TRILL
   layer 2 implementation, note the IS-IS constraints for the current
   version of TRILL [RFC6325]:

   o The TRILL IS-IS instance uses a single Level 1 IS-IS area.

   o The TRILL Level 1 IS-IS area uses the fixed area address zero.

   o The TRILL IS-IS instance is not used for IP address advertisement.

   o The TRILL IS-IS instance is used for only a single protocol: TRILL.

   Accordingly, tables which report IP address reachability and tables
   which allow configuration or reporting of multiple IS-IS areas,
   multiple IS-IS levels or multiple protocols, will be empty in the
   ISIS-MIB module for the current version of TRILL.

Internet-Draft          RBridges: TRILL Base MIB        December 3, 2012


   Note also that when more than one instance of the IS-IS protocol is
   running on a device, as in the case of a device performing both
   RBridge and IS-IS IP router functions, multiple instances of the
   ISIS-MIB module can be distinguished by the use of SNMPv3 contexts or
   SNMPv1 communities.

6.8  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863],
   INET-ADDRESS-MIB[RFC4001], BRIDGE-MIB[RFC4188] and
   Q-BRIDGE-MIB[RFC4363]. (The IEEE Bridge MIB modules import similar
   TCs.)

8. Security Considerations

   This MIB relates to a system which will provide network connectivity
   and packet forwarding services. As such, improper manipulation of the
   objects represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a
   large number of end-users.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability are described below.
 


Rijhsinghani & Zebrose    Expires June 6, 2013                 [Page 52]

Internet-Draft          RBridges: TRILL Base MIB        December 3, 2012


   The following tables and objects in the RBRIDGE-MIB can be
   manipulated to interfere with the operation of RBridges:

   o rbridgeBaseUniMultipathEnable affects the ability of the RBridge to
   multipath unicast traffic, and rbridgeBaseMultiMultipathEnable
   affects the ability of the Rbridge to multipath multi-destination
   traffic.

   o rbridgeBasePortTable contains a number of objects that may affect
   network connectivity. Actions that may be triggered by manipulating
   objects in this table include disabling of an RBridge port;
   discarding of native packets; disabling learning and others.

   o rbridgeEsadiTable contains objects that affect the operation of the
   ESADI protocol used for learning, and manipulation of the objects
   contained therein can be used to confuse the learning ability of
   Rbridges.

   o rbridgeDtreePriority can affect computation of distribution trees
   within an Rbridge campus, thereby affecting forwarding of multi-
   destination traffic.

   o rbridgeTrillMinMtuDesired can affect the size of packets being used
   to exchange information between RBridges. 

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP. For example, access to network topology and
   Rbridge attributes can reveal information that should not be
   available to all users of the network.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there
   is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
   and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
   module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator

   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   For other RBridge security considerations see [RFC6325].

9. IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:


   Descriptor OBJECT IDENTIFIER value

   ---------- -----------------------


   rbridgeMIB { mib-2 xxx }


   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "xxx" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.
