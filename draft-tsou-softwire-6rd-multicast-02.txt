Internet-Draft           IPv6 Multicast With 6rd          September 2012


1.  Introduction

   6rd ([RFC5569], [RFC5969]) provides a means to connect IPv6 hosts to
   the IPv6 Internet across an IPv4 provider network.  Unicast traffic
   is carried through IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels.  It is possible to carry
   multicast traffic from the IPv6 network through the IPv4 network in
   the same way, but if multiple customers wish access to the same
   multicast channels, the failure to use the native multicast
   capabilities of the IPv4 network wastes resources in that network.

   This document describes a solution using the native multicast
   capabilities of the IPv4 network to acquire and forward multicast
   traffic from the IPv6 Internet to an IPv6 host attached to the IPv4
   network.  Typically this solution will operate in combination with
   6rd for unicast traffic.  However, no IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling is
   required for signalling, only the ability to interwork between IPv4
   and IPv6 at the 6rd Customer Equipment (6rd CE) and the 6rd Border
   Relay (6rd BR).

1.1.  Terminology

   The term "address pair" is used to denote the combination of unicast
   source address and multicast group address corresponding to a given
   multicast stream at a given point along the path between the source
   and receiver.


2.  Description of the Solution

   A number of problems have to be solved to allow an IPv6 host attached
   to an IPv4 network to request and receive a multicast stream
   originating in a neighbouring IPv6 network and passing through the
   IPv4 network using the native multicast facilities of that network.
   These problems are described in detail in the course of presenting
   proposed solutions to them.

   It is assumed that the IPv6 host wishing to receive a multicast
   stream acquires the corresponding IPv6 address pair by means out of
   scope of this document.  See [ID.mboned-multrans-addr-acq].

2.1.  Assumed Architecture

   This document assumes an architecture similar to that of 6rd
   [RFC5569], [RFC5969], with additional capabilities for the 6rd
   Customer Edge (CE) and the 6rd Border Relay (6rd BR).  See Figure 1.

                                 Function

   In addition to its 6rd responsibilities, the 6rd CE is responsible
   for:

   o  mapping between the IPv6 address pair presented by the IPv6 Host
      and an IPv4 address pair designating the same multicast stream in
      the provider's IPv4 network;

   o  accepting MLD [RFC3810] on the IPv6 Host side and emitting IGMP
      [RFC3376] toward the provider's IPv4 network;

   o  using the reverse mapping from IPv6 to IPv4 address pairs to
      translate incoming IPv4 multicast streams to IPv6 before
      forwarding them to the IPv6 Host.  Alternatively, decapsulating
      IPv6 multicast data packets from incoming IPv4 packets.

   The Provider IP Edge has the normal function of interworking between
   IGMP [RFC3376] and PIM [RFC4601] multicast signalling.

   The Border Relay has the usual 6rd responsibilities.  In addition, it
   is responsible for:

   o  mapping between IPv4 address pairs received in PIM messages from
      the IPv4 network and IPv6 address pairs denoting the same
      multicast streams in the neighbouring IPv6 network;

   o  translating addresses in PIM between the IPv4 and IPv6 networks;

   o  using the reverse mapping from IPv6 to IPv4 address pairs to
      translate and forward multicast data packets coming from the IPv6
      network.  Alternatively, using the reverse mapping to generate
      encapsulating IPv4 headers for the IPv6 packets before forwarding
      them as multicast IPv4 data.

2.2.  Components of the Proposed Solution

2.2.1.  Address Mapping

   Both the 6rd CE and the 6rd BR need to map between IPv6 and IPv4
   addresses, in both directions.  The IPv6 address pairs do not have to
   be the same at the two nodes, so long as the IPv6 address pair used

   by the host designates the same multicast stream as the IPv6 address
   pair generated at the 6rd BR or received from the source IPv6
   network.

   Because the source network uses IPv6, mapping between the addresses
   used in that network and the IPv4 addresses used in the provider
   network is in general a difficult problem.  The most general solution
   is to configure static mappings between the IPv6 and corresponding
   IPv4 address pairs at the 6rd BR.  Mapping at the 6rd CE can use
   IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses as defined in [RFC6052] for the unicast
   source addresses, and [ID.mboned-64-mcast-addr-fmt] for the multicast
   group addresses.  This assumes that the IPv6 host has been provided
   with such addresses in the first place.  It also assumes that the
   IPv4 network provider can configure suitable prefixes at the 6rd CE
   for the purpose of such mapping.

   With restrictions on the IPv6 addresses used for multicast source and
   group addresses in the IPv6 network, it may be possible to use
   algorithmic instead of static mapping at the 6rd BR.  This generally
   requires coordination between the IPv4 and IPv6 network operators.

2.2.2.  Multicast Routing

   For each IPv4 address to which an IPv6 source address is mapped, the
   routing tables that PIM uses must result in a path that passes
   through a multicast-enabled 6rd BR.  At the routing level, this means
   that the 6rd BR must advertise reachability to the mapped IPv4 source
   addresses it knows about into the IPv4 domain.  Its distance metrics
   to those addresses must reflect the routing information it receives
   on the IPv6 side for their IPv6 counterparts.

2.2.3.  Translation From MLD To IGMP

   See [ID.perreault-igmp-mld-translation].

2.2.4.  Interworking Between PIM With IPv4 and PIM with IPv6 At the 6rd
        BR

   See [ID.taylor-pim-v4v6-translation].

2.2.5.  Transport of Multicast Data Packets and Unicast RTCP Feedback

   The documents cited in the previous two sections describe the process
   of header translation for multicast data packets.  The address
   mapping aspect of that translation was discussed in Section 2.2.1.
   If the 6rd BR and 6rd CE are configured to use encapsulation/
   decapsulation of multicast data packets instead, the encapsulating
   IPv4 header uses the IPv4 address pair mapped from the original IPv6

   address pair as source and destination.  However, this requires that
   the IPv6 host uses the same IPv6 addresses as the source IPv6 network
   for each multicast stream it receives.  That may force the 6rd CE to
   use static rather than algorithmic mapping for address pairs for its
   MLD/IGMP translation.

   When the IPv6 Host sends unicast RTCP [RFC3550] feedback toward the
   source, the packets are treated by the 6rd CE and 6rd BR like any
   other unicast packets.  That is, they are encapsulated at the 6rd CE,
   transported across the IPv4 network as IPv6-in-IPv4, and decapsulated
   at the 6rd BR before forwarding into the IPv6 network.
