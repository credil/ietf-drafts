eICP: Extended Internet Cache Protocol to support today's content-based
                             cache exchange
                        draft-zhang-ppsp-eicp-00

Abstract

   This draft proposes three ways to extend the existing ICP protocol in
   order to support today's content-based Internet environment.  Since
   the newly created PPSP protocol is especially designed for today's
   network condition, we will take its advantages here.

   The three proposals are: (1) Embedding PPSP in ICP; (2) PPSP and ICP
   Co-existing in caches communication; (3) Using PPSP to replace ICP.

1.  Introduction

   The existing ICP (Internet Cache Protocol) protocol is a lightweight
   message format used between neighbor Web Caches to communicate with
   each other.

   ICP is used to exchange hints about the URLs in neighbor caches in
   order to select the most appropriate location to retrieve object.
   [RFC2186]

   However, nowadays, as the Peer-to-Peer communication becomes popular
   and we prefer content to document since content's usually easier to
   transport and share as it can be segmented in to smaller chunks.[
   draft-ietf-ppsp-problem-statement-01] The ICP protocol may become
   unsuitable since it just locates the object by its URL.  In today's
   network, caches often cache chunks, which are the pieces of the
   desired complete content.[ draft-ietf-ppsp-problem-statement-01] This
   makes data transmission faster with better user experience.  In such
   cases URL may be not applicable to locate these chunks (even were
   this the case, it may be too heavyweight and what worse, same chunks
   with different URLs cannot be easily identified and shared).
   Therefore the ICP protocol loses its prowess to some extent.

   Fortunately, the newly proposed PPSP (P2P Streaming Protocol)
   protocol can locate the cached chunks, by their Chunk IDs, and PPSP
   Peer protocol can be used by caches to communication among them to
   exchange chunk information as below [draft-gu-ppsp-peer-protocol-02]:

   1.  Bitmap indicating which chunks a peer possesses (for the offline
       case) or swarms they are participating in (for the live streaming
       case);

   2.  Required chunk IDs or requested streams;

   3.  Peer preference indicating what kind of candidate peers a
       requesting peer may prefer;

   4.  Information that can help to improve the performance of PPSP.

   Recently, caches have being tried to change their topology and
   communication paradigm to better deal with large-size chunks(e.g.,
   Video and file)[reference, Akamai, Limelight].  In this sense caches
   can be treated as peers as well, and we can introduce PPSP protocol
   here to complement the ICP protocol since it may be more suitable for
   today's data storing.

3.  Three ways to extend the original ICP protocol

   Here we propose three possible ways to update the original ICP
   protocol to make it adapt to the new mode of data transmission and
   storage.

3.1.  Embedding PPSP in ICP protocol

   Here we just propose one possible way to embed PPSP in ICP.

   We may use an identifier to indicate if the protocol is an original
   ICP protocol or a new one with PPSP embedded in.

   According to [RFC2186], the values of Opcode in ICP are in the
   interval [0,23] and both 5~9 and 12~20 are unused.  So we may use
   just one bit of the 8-bit Opcode for identification.  For example,
   when this 1-bit identifier sets to zero, we may think that this
   message is an ICP message, and when it sets to one, then it is a PPSP
   message.

   The extended format of ICP protocol is as below:

   Further we can extend the Opcode by using the unused values to
   express the PPSP information:

                                  Table 1

   When the 1-bit identifier sets to one, then the values above will be
   activated and the cache receiving ICP message turns to interpret a
   PPSP message.  The messages above are used the definitions in
   [draft-gu-ppsp-peer-protocol-02].

   Note: Whether we can reuse part of Opcode of the original ICP
   protocol to achieve the PPSP functionality will be discussed in
   updated version of this draft.

   Accordingly, when we use the PPSP message, the specific response
   message should carry Chunk IDs in its body instead of URLs in the ICP
   format.

   If the protocol between neighbor caches is ICP protocol, it means the
   transmitting data between neighbor caches should be document,
   otherwise should be chunks.

3.2.  PPSP and ICP Co-existing in caches communication

   In this design, if cache nodes cache the document, then when others
   want this document's information, caches will use ICP protocol to
   communicate, if caches cache chunks instead, then caches will
   communicate using PPSP protocol.

   However, caches may need a functional entity, namely a Data Type
   Prober, to identify the form of the data (document/chunk).

   Here we give a paragraph to illustrate this scenario:


   +------------------------------------------------------+
   |                                                      |
   |++++++++++++++++++                ++++++++++++++++++  |
   ||                |                |                |  |
   || Cache 1        |                | Cache 2        |  |
   ||     ---------- |                | ----------     |  |
   ||    | Data Type||                || Data Type|    |  |
   ||    | Prober   |--------ICP-------| Prober   |    |  |
   ||    |          |-------PPSP-------|          |    |  |
   ||     ---------- |                | ----------     |  |
   ||                |                |                |  |
   |++++++++++++++++++                ++++++++++++++++++  |
   +------------------------------------------------------+


                                 Figure 2

   As figure 2 shows, in this scenario, each cache needs to inform the
   Data Type Prober the data it caches, and by using some mechanism, the
   Data Type Prober will know if the data type is document or chunk.
   When communication occurs, the Data Type Prober will decide the
   message type according to the type of cached data.

   Note: Since there are two formats of protocol between caches, this
   condition may bring in some terrible consequences such as confusion
   and ambiguity.

3.3.  Using PPSP to replace ICP

   In this means, we just use PPSP protocol to make caches exchange
   their information.  However, we may need to extend the existing PPSP
   protocol since it does not support locating data by URLs right now.

   This scenario is familiar with scenario in section 3.1, the only
   difference is that we are trying to update the existing PPSP protocol

Internet-Draft                    eICP                         July 2011


   instead.

   Here we need to introduce a new member? to PPSP message field.  We
   call it "TYPE" here to indicate the type of cached data.

   Then we extend the existing PPSP protocol by adding ICP Opcodes in
   its method field.

   When TYPE indicates that the cached data would be a document, these
   Opcodes will be activated, otherwise it is just a normal PPSP
   protocol.

   According to [RFC2186], the Opcodes are: ICP_OP_INVALID;
   ICP_OP_QUERY; ICP_OP_HIT; ICP_OP_MISS; ICP_OP_ERR; ICP_OP_SECHO;
   ICP_OP_DECHO; ICP_OP_MISS_NOFETCH; ICP_OP_DENIED; ICP_OP_HIT_OBJ; and
   their definitions and corresponding operations will be in accordance
   with [RFC2186].

   However, is the PPSP message should also be called ICP?  It's a
   further discussion we will make in the future.

   Note: Whether we can reuse some operations already defined in PPSP
   protocol method field to achieve the ICP functionality will be
   discussed in updated version of this draft.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of ICP protocol and PPSP protocol are in
   accordance with descriptions in [RFC2187] and
   [draft-gu-ppsp-peer-protocol-02].

   However, in this memo, we should consider if the extension of ICP
   protocol or PPSP protocol would bring in redundancy in encoding as
   section 3.1 and 3.3 mentioned.  Besides, we should consider the
   scenario that both ICP and PPSP exist as section 3.2 mentioned, since
   this proposal may introduce confusion and ambiguity.

6.  Conclusions

   Here we introduce three ways to extend the existing ICP protocol in
   order to adapt to today's content-based network condition.

   We can extend ICP protocol by:

   1.  Setting a 1-bit identifier and adding new definitions in its
       Opcode field;

   2.  Using both ICP and PPSP in caches communication, and a functional
       entity called Data Type Prober will help to determine which
       protocol should be used;

   3.  Adding a newly defined message in method field which called
       "TYPE" to indicate the type of this protocol, we may also add ICP
       Opcode operations in PPSP method field, too.
