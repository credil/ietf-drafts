    <abstract>
      <t>
	There is often a need to provide large aggregates of bandwidth
	that are best provided using parallel links between routers or
	MPLS LSR.  In core networks there is often no alternative
	since the aggregate capacities of core networks today far
	exceed the capacity of a single physical link or single packet
	processing element.
      </t>
      <t>
	The presence of parallel links, with each link potentially
	comprised of multiple layers has resulted in additional
	requirements.  Certain services may benefit from being
	restricted to a subset of the component links or a specific
	component link, where component link characteristics, such as
	latency, differ.  Certain services require that an LSP be
	treated as atomic and avoid reordering.  Other services will
	continue to require only that reordering not occur within a
	microflow as is current practice.
      </t>
      <t>
	Current practice related to multipath is described briefly in
	an appendix.

	The purpose of this document is to describe why network

	business problems (<xref target="assumptions" />). The intent
	is to first describe why things need to be done in terms of
	functional requirements that are as independent as possible of
	protocol specifications (<xref target="FR" />). For certain
	functional requirements this document describes a set of
	derived protocol requirements (<xref target="DR" />).  Three
	appendices provide supporting details as a summary of
	existing/prior operator approaches (<xref
	target="network-operator-practices" />), a summary of
	implementation techniques and relevant protocol standards
	(<xref target="multipath-bcp" />), and a summary of G.800
	terminology used to define a composite link (<xref

      </t>
  <!--  Tony Li Comment: Need many references here. Lucy provided 
  ones for services, do we need ones for signaled MPLS and MPLS-TP?-->
      <t>
	The locations in a network where these requirements apply are a

      <t>
	The IP DSCP cannot be used for flow identification since L3VPN
	requires Diffserv transparency (see <xref target="RFC4031">RFC

	  Limiting the period of unavailability in response to

	  as maintaining stability. The transient period between some
	  service disrupting event and the convergence of the routing
	  and/or signaling protocols MUST occur within a time frame
	  specified by NPO values. 
	  <xref target="network-operator-practices" /> provides

	  <list counter="fr" hangIndent="4" style="format FR#%d">
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means to summarize some
	      routing advertisements regarding the characteristics of
	      a composite link such that the routing protocol
	      converges within the timeframe needed to meet the
	      network performance objective. A composite link CAN be
	      announced in conjunction with detailed parameters about
	      its component links, such as bandwidth and latency. The
	      composite link SHALL behave as a single IGP adjacency.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL ensure that all possible restoration
	      operations happen within the timeframe needed to meet
	      the NPO.  The solution may need to specify a means for
	      aggregating signaling to meet this requirement.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a mechanism to select a path
	      for a flow across a network that contains a number of
	      paths comprised of pairs of nodes connected by composite
	      links in such a way as to automatically distribute the
	      load over the network nodes connected by composite links
	      while meeting all of the other mandatory requirements

	      If extensions to existing protocols are specified and/or

      <section anchor="layering"
	       title="Component Links Provided by Lower Layer
	       Networks">
	<t>
	  Case 3 as defined in <xref target="ITU-T.G.800" /> involves
	  a component link supporting an MPLS layer network over
	  another lower layer network (e.g., circuit switched or
	  another MPLS network (e.g., MPLS-TP)). The lower layer
	  network may change the latency (and/or other performance
	  parameters) seen by the MPLS layer network. Network
	  Operators have NPOs of which some components are based on
	  performance parameters. Currently, there is no protocol for
	  the lower layer network to inform the higher layer network
	  of a change in a performance parameter. Communication of the
	  latency performance parameter is a very important
	  requirement. Communication of other performance parameters
	  (e.g., delay variation) is desirable.
          <list counter="fr" hangIndent="4" style="format FR#%d">
	    <t>
	      In order to support network NPOs and provide acceptable
	      user experience, the solution SHALL specify a protocol
	      means to allow a lower layer server network to
	      communicate latency to the higher layer client network.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The precision of latency reporting SHOULD be at least 10%
	      of the one way latencies for latency of 1 ms or more.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means to limit the latency
	      on a per LSP basis between nodes within a network to
	      meet an NPO target when the path between these nodes
	      contains one or more pairs of nodes connected via a
	      composite link.  <vspace blankLines="1" /> The NPOs
	      differ across the services, and some services have
	      different NPOs for different QoS classes, for example,
	      one QoS class may have a much larger latency bound than
	      another. Overload can occur which would violate an NPO
	      parameter (e.g., loss) and some remedy to handle this
	      case for a composite link is required.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      If the total demand offered by traffic flows exceeds the
	      capacity of the composite link, the solution SHOULD define
	      a means to cause the LSPs for some traffic flows to move
	      to some other point in the network that is not
	      congested. These "preempted LSPs" may not be restored if
	      there is no uncongested path in the network.

	<t>
	  Corresponding to Case 1 of <xref target="ITU-T.G.800" />, as
	  one means to provide high availability, network operators
	  deploy a topology in the MPLS network using lower layer
	  networks that have a certain degree of diversity at the
	  lower layer(s).  Many techniques have been developed to
	  balance the distribution of flows across component links
	  that connect the same pair of nodes.  When the path for a
	  flow can be chosen from a set of candidate nodes connected
	  via composite links, other techniques have been developed.
<!-- The following sections break the requirements into three cases
     determined by the connectivity of the component links: a) same
     pair of nodes or sites, b) same pair of nodes only, c) component
     links connecting multiple pairs of nodes in a pair of sites. -->
<!-- The set of case a, b, c above doesn't make sense.  Case a seems
     to be the superset of case b and c.  If that is the intent, then
     the text needs to be clear about it.  DM: That was the idea, case
     a applies to both b and c to reduce amount of text. Rewrote this
     however.  -->

	      The solution SHALL measure traffic on a labeled traffic
	      flow and dynamically select the component link on which
	      to place this flow in order to balance the load so that
	      no component link in the composite link between a pair
	      of nodes is overloaded.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      When a traffic flow is moved from one component link to
	      another in the same composite link between a set of
	      nodes (or sites), it MUST be done so in a minimally
	      disruptive manner.  <vspace blankLines="1" /> When a
	      flow is moved from a current link to a target link with
	      different latency, reordering can occur if the target
	      link latency is less than that of the current or
	      clumping can occur if target link latency is greater
	      than that of the current. Therefore, some flows (e.g.,
	      timing distribution, PW circuit emulation) are quite
	      sensitive to these effects, which may be specified in an
	      NPO or are needed to meet a user experience objective
	      (e.g. jitter buffer under/overrun).

	      protocol.
<!-- or a targer latency? DM: Same as Max acceptable from Ning?-->
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means to indicate that a
	      traffic flow shall select a component link with a
	      maximum acceptable delay variation value as specified by
	      protocol.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means local to a node that 
	      automatically distributes flows across the component links 
	      in the composite link such that NPOs are met.
	   </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means to distribute flows
	      from a single LSP across multiple component links to
	      handle at least the case where the traffic carried in an
	      LSP exceeds that of any component link in the composite
	      link. As defined in section 3, a flow is a sequence of 
	      packets that must be transferred on one component link. 
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHOULD support the use case where a
	      composite link itself is a component link for a higher
	      order composite link.  For example, a composite link
	      comprised of MPLS-TP bi-directional tunnels viewed as
	      logical links could then be used as a component link in
	      yet another composite link that connects MPLS routers.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution MUST support an optional means for LSP
	      signaling to bind an LSP to a particular component link
	      within a composite link.  If this option is not
	      exercised, then an LSP that is bound to a composite link
	      may be bound to any component link matching all other
	      signaled requirements, and different directions of a
	      bidirectional LSP can be bound to different component
	      links.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution MUST support a means to indicate that
	      both directions of co-routed bidirectional LSP MUST be
	      bound to the same component link.

	This section takes the next step and derives high-level
	requirements on protocol specification from the functional
	requirements.
	<list counter="dr" hangIndent="4" style="format DR#%d">
	  <t>
	    The solution SHOULD attempt to extend existing protocols
	    wherever possible, developing a new protocol only if this
	    adds a significant set of capabilities.
<!-- This is not a requirement.  It is a religious manifesto -
	    &lt;vspace blankLines="1" /&gt; The vast majority of network
	    operators have provisioned L3VPN services over LDP. Many
	    have deployed L2VPN services over LDP as well. TE
	    extensions to IGP and RSVP-TE are viewed as being overly
	    complex by some operators.
 -->
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    A solution SHOULD extend LDP capabilities to meet
	    functional requirements (without using TE methods as
	    decided in <xref target="RFC3468" />).
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Coexistence of LDP and RSVP-TE signaled LSPs MUST be
	    supported on a composite link. Other functional
	    requirements should be supported as independently of
	    signaling protocol as possible.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    When the nodes connected via a composite link are in the
	    same MPLS network topology, the solution MAY define
	    extensions to the IGP.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    When the nodes are connected via a composite link are in
	    different MPLS network topologies, the solution SHALL NOT
	    rely on extensions to the IGP.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The Solution SHOULD support composite link IGP
	    advertisement that results in convergence time better than
	    that of advertising the individual component links.  The
	    solution SHALL be designed so that it represents the range
	    of capabilities of the individual component links such
	    that functional requirements are met, and also minimizes
	    the frequency of advertisement updates which may cause IGP
	    convergence to occur.
	    
	    <vspace blankLines="1" /> Examples of advertisement update
	    triggering events to be considered include: LSP
	    establishment/release, changes in component link
	    characteristics (e.g., latency, up/down state), and/or
	    bandwidth utilization.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    When a worst case failure scenario occurs, the number of
	    RSVP-TE LSPs to be resignaled will cause a period of
	    unavailability as perceived by users. The resignaling time
	    of the solution MUST meet the NPO objective for the
	    duration of unavailability. The resignaling time of the
	    solution MUST not increase significantly as compared with
	    current methods.

      <t>
	This document specifies a set of requirements.  The
	requirements themselves do not pose a security threat.  If
	these requirements are met using MPLS signaling as commonly
	practiced today with authenticated but unencrypted OSPF-TE,
	ISIS-TE, and RSVP-TE or LDP, then the requirement to provide
	additional information in this communication presents
	additional information that could conceivably be gathered in a
	man-in-the-middle confidentiality breach.  Such an attack
	would require a capability to monitor this signaling either
	through a provider breach or access to provider physical
	transmission infrastructure.  A provider breach already poses
	a threat of numerous tpes of attacks which are of far more
	serious consequence.  Encrption of the signaling can prevent
	or render more difficult any confidentiality breach that
	otherwise might occur by means of access to provider physical
	transmission infrastructure.
