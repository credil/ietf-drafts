      <t>
	The Kerberos 5 network authentication protocol originally used
	the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for encryption. Almost 30
	years it introduced the first DES standard, the National
	Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) finally withdrew
	the DES standard in 2005, reflecting a long-established
	consensus that DES no longer provides adequate security. In
	2006, it cost less than EUR 10,000 to build a machine to brute
	force DES keys in an average of 8.7 days. By 2008, it was
	possible to buy commercial hardware that breaks DES keys in
	less than a day on average. DES is long past its sell-by
	date. Accordingly, this document updates RFC1964, RFC4120, and
	RFC4121 to deprecate the use of DES in Kerberos. Because the
	original Kerberos 5 specification, RFC1510 (obsoleted by RFC
	4120), supports only DES, this document also reclassifies
	RFC1510 as Historic.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	The original specification of the Kerberos 5 network
	authentication protocol <xref target="RFC1510"/> supports only
	the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for encryption. For many
	years, cryptographic community has regarded DES as providing
	inadequate security.  This document reclassifies <xref
	target="RFC1510"/> as Historic, and updates current
	Kerberos-related specifications <xref target="RFC1964"/>,
	<xref target="RFC4120"/>, and <xref target="RFC4121"/> to
	deprecate the use of DES in Kerberos.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Affected specifications">
      <t>
	The initial IETF specification of the Kerberos 5 network
	authentication protocol <xref target="RFC1510"/> supports only
	the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for encryption. <xref
	target="RFC4120"/> updates the Kerberos specification to
	include additional cryptographic algorithms. <xref
	target="RFC3961"/> describes the Kerberos cryptographic system
	and includes support for Data Encryption Standard (DES)
	encryption types.
      </t>

      <t>
	DES no longer provides adequate cryptographic protection. This
	document updates <xref target="RFC1964"/>, <xref
	target="RFC4120"/>, and <xref target="RFC4121"/> to deprecate
	the use of DES in Kerberos. Because the version of Kerberos
	specified in <xref target="RFC1510"/> supports only DES, and
	<xref target="RFC4120"/> supersedes it, this document
	reclassifies <xref target="RFC1510"/> as Historic.
      </t>

      <t>
	The specification of the Kerberos Generic Security Services
	Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) mechanism <xref
	target="RFC1964"/> and its updated version <xref
	target="RFC4121"/> define checksum and encryption mechanisms
	based on DES. With the existence of newer encryption types for
	Kerberos GSS-API defined in <xref target="RFC4121"/>,
	Microsoft's ARCFOUR-HMAC based GSS-API mechanism, and MIT's
	DES3, there is no need to support the old DES based integrity
	(SGN) and confidentiality (SEAL) types.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="DES insecurity">
      <t>
	The insecurity of DES has been evident for many years. The
	National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
	officially withdrew DES in 2005 <xref
	target="DES-Withdrawal"/>, and also announced a transition
	period that ended on May 19, 2007 <xref
	target="DES-Transition-Plan"/>. The IETF has also published
	its position in <xref target="RFC4772"/>, in which the
	recommendation summary is very clear: "don't use DES".
      </t>

      <t>
	In 2006, researchers demonstrated the ability to brute force a
	DES key in an average of less than 9 days using less than EUR
	10,000 worth of hardware <xref target="Break-DES"/>. By 2008,
	a company was offering hardware capable of breaking a DES key
	in less than a day on average <xref target="DES-1day"/>. Brute
	force key searches of DES will only get faster and
	cheaper. (The aforementioned company markets its device for
	one-click recovery of lost DES keys.) It is clear that it is
	well past time to retire the use of DES in Kerberos.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Recommendations">
      <t>
	This document removes the following RECOMMENDED types from
	<xref target="RFC4120"/>:
	<list style='empty'>
	  <t>Encryption: DES-CBC-MD5(3)</t>
	  <t>Checksums: DES-MD5 (8, RSA-MD5-DES from <xref target="RFC3961"/>).</t>
	</list>
      </t>

      <t>
	Kerberos implementation and deployments SHOULD NOT implement
	the single DES encryption types: DES-CBC-CRC(1),
	DES-CBC-MD4(2), DES-CBC-MD5(3).
      </t>

      <t>
	Kerberos implementation and deployments SHOULD NOT implement
	the checksum types: CRC32(1), RSA-MD4(2), RSA-MD4-DES(3),
	DES-MAC(4), DES-MAC-K(5), RSA-MD4-MAC-K(6), DES-MD5(7),
	RSA-MD5-DES(8).
      </t>

      <t>
	Note that RSA-MD5 might be used with non-DES encryption types,
	for example, when doing a TGS-REQ with ARCFOUR-HMAC-MD5, some
	clients use RSA-MD5 for the checksum that is stored inside the
	encrypted part of the authenticator. This use of RSA-MD5 is to
	be considered safe, so Kerberos implementations MAY allow this
	usage when used with legacy systems that can't handle newer
	checksum types.
      </t>

      <t>
	Kerberos GSS mechanism implementation and deployments SHOULD
	NOT implement the SGN ALG: DES MAC MD5(0000), MD2.5(0100), DES
	MAC(0200) (updates <xref target="RFC1964"/>).
      </t>

      <t>
	Kerberos GSS mechanism implementation and deployments SHOULD
	NOT implement the SEAL ALG: DES(0000) (updates <xref target="RFC1964"/>).
      </t>

      <t>
	The effect of the two last sentences is that this document
	deprecates section 1.2 in <xref target="RFC1964"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
	This document hereby reclassifies <xref target="RFC1510"/> as
	Historic.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Other old enctypes">
      <t>
	The following older encryption types and checksum types should
	not be deployed and can be disabled by default by
	implementations:
      </t>

      <t>XXX add list here</t>

    <section title="Acknowledgements">

      <t>
	Jeffrey Hutzelman, Simon Josefsson, Mattias Amnefelt, Leif
	Johansson, and Ran Atkinson have read the document and
	provided suggestions for improvements. Sam Hartman proposed
	moving <xref target="RFC1510"/> to Historic.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <t>
	Removing support for single DES improves security since DES is
	considered to be insecure.
      </t>

      <t>
	Kerberos defines some encryption types that are either
	underspecified or that were only allocated a number in the
	specifications. Implementations should make sure that they
	only implement and enable secure encryption types.
      </t>

      <t>
	RC4, used in ARCFOUR-HMAC, is considered weak; however, the
	use in Kerberos is vetted and considered secure for now. The
	main reason to not actively discourage the use of
	ARCFOUR-HMAC is that it is the only encryption type that
	interoperates with older versions of Microsoft Windows once
	DES is removed.
