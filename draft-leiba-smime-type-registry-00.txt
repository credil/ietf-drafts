         Creation of a registry for smime-type parameter values
                   draft-leiba-smime-type-registry-00

Abstract

   Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) defined the
   Content-Type parameter "smime-type".  As the list of defined values
   for that parameter has increased, it has become clear that a registry
   is needed to document those values.  This document creates that
   registry, registers the current values, and specifies the policies
   for registration of new values.

1.  Introduction

   Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) defined the
   Content-Type "application/pkcs7-mime" and the parameter "smime-type",
   along with four valid values for the parameter [RFC3851].
   Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) added two new parameter values
   [RFC5273].  [RFC5751] replaced RFC 3851 and registered the
   application/pkcs7-mime media type, but did not create a registry for
   the smime-type values.

   When Enrollment over Secure Transport [I-D.ietf-pkix-est] added
   another parameter value, it became clear that a registry for smime-
   type parameter values is necessary.  Section 2 creates that registry,
   registers the current values that are defined in the three previous
   documents, and specifies the policies for registration of new values.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests two IANA actions.

   IANA is asked to change the reference field for the media type
   "application/pkcs7-mime" to "[RFC5751], [RFC-leiba-smime-type-
   registry]", replacing the latter with the RFC number for this RFC.
   This replaces the references to RFC5273 and RFC-ietf-pkix-est with
   this document, as those references are no longer needed.

   IANA is asked to create a new sub-registry under the Multipurpose
   Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) and Media Types top-level registry.

Internet-Draft       Registry for smime-type values          August 2013


   The new registry is "Parameter values for the smime-type parameter",
   the reference for the registry is "[RFC-leiba-smime-type-registry],
   [RFC5751]", and the initial values for the registry are as follows:

   +----------------------+-----------------------------------+
   |  smime-type value    |  Reference                        |
   +----------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | certs-only           | [RFC5751] Section 3.2.2           |
   | CMC-Request          | [RFC5273] Section 3               |
   | CMC-Response         | [RFC5273] Section 3               |
   | compressed-data      | [RFC5751] Section 3.2.2           |
   | enveloped-data       | [RFC5751] Section 3.2.2           |
   | server-generated-key | [RFC-ietf-pkix-est] Section 4.4.2 |
   | signed-data          | [RFC5751] Section 3.2.2           |
   +----------------------+-----------------------------------+


   [[RFC Editor: please replace RFC-ietf-pkix-est in the table above
   with the RFC number assigned to draft-ietf-pkix-est.  Note that it is
   NOT the RFC number for this RFC!]]

   New values can be registered using the RFC Required policy, as
   defined in [RFC5226].  The S/MIME Message Specification [RFC5751],
   Section 3.2.2, specifies guidelines for assigning new smime-type
   parameter values, and those guidelines apply to the assignment of
   values in this registry.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document is purely administrative, and presents no security
   issues.
