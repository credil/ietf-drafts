    Recommendation for Encoding IP Address and FQDN in DHCP Options
              draft-boucadair-dhc-address-name-encoding-03

Abstract

   This document aims at providing a recommendation for the design of
   future DHCP options when both IP Address and FQDN encoding are needed
   to be supported.  This design reconciles the flexibility requirement
   from service providers and the DHC WG recommendation to avoid
   defining multiple options conveying similar set of configuration
   data.

Internet-Draft              Name DHCP Option               November 2012


1.  Introduction

   Within this document DHCP is used to denote both DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and
   DHCPv6 [RFC3315].

   This document sketches a recommendation which aims to reconcile both
   what is discussed in Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines]
   and also the requirements of operators in some specific contexts.
   The proposed approach adopts a simple encoding which achieves the
   following goals:

   o  A DHCP server can be configured to inject one or multiple FQDNs in
      the option.
   o  A DHCP server can be configured to inject one or multiple IP
      addresses in the option
   o  A DHCP server can be configured to resolve the FQDN and inject the
      resolved IP address(es) as IP literals in the option.
   o  A DHCP server can convey in one single option both IPv4 and IPv6
      address literals when serving dual-stack clients.
   o  A DHCP server can convey a hostname or any name which may be
      passed to a name resolution library.
   o  DHCP clients are expected to pass the conveyed string to any
      supported name resolution library (DNS is only a name resolution
      service among others).

   This document is mainly motivated by the discussions which have been
   taken place during the production process of [RFC6334] and recently
   within PCP working group.  For more details, readers are invited to
   check softwire and pcp mailing list archives.

   Section 2 provides a reminder of the issue.  A recommendation is
   proposed in Section 3.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Problem: IP Address or FQDN Dilemma

   The support of both IP Address and FQDN option allows for better
   flexibility for service providers which are free to make their own
   engineering choices and use the convenient option according to their
   deployment context: Return an FQDN or an IP address in DHCP is
   deployment-specific.

Internet-Draft              Name DHCP Option               November 2012


   In the past, no objection was made against defining two options (or
   sub-options) to convey an IP Address and a FQDN for the same service.
   A non-exhaustive list of these options include: [RFC3361], [RFC3319],
   [RFC5678] and [RFC4280].  But recently, there were objections
   (relying on [I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines]) against progressing
   some specification documents (e.g., [RFC6334]); as such those
   specification documents were updated to select only one scheme (IP
   Address or a FQDN option) to convey in a DHCP option.  That decision
   was convenient for providers planning to use a FQDN but was not
   appropriate for those planning to use an IP Address.

   For both IP Address and FQDN, it is likely a cache to be maintained
   by the client.  Means to flush out this cache are needed for both
   modes.

   Criteria to support an IP Address or a FQDN depends on each
   deployment context, operational considerations and also whether some
   advanced features are supported by the DHCP server or by the host
   embedding the client.  More discussion is provided in the following
   sub-sections.

2.1.  Arguments in Favor of IP Address Option

2.1.1.  A Server Can Resolve the FQDN

   An argument which was advanced in favor of supporting an IP Address
   option instead of a FQDN is the server can be configured to resolve
   first the configured FQDN and then return the resolved IP Address in
   a dedicated option.

   This design has the advantage to not require name resolution
   capabilities at the client side.  Nevertheless, it is not compliant
   with some operational modes such as the one discussed in
   Section 2.2.2.

2.1.2.  A Client May Not Embed a DNS Resolver

   Returning an IP address does not require the client to embed a DNS
   resolver.

   This argument may be objected as implementing a DNS resolver is
   claimed to be cheap and devices which don't embed DNS resolver are
   uncommon.

2.2.  Arguments in Favor of FQDN Option

Internet-Draft              Name DHCP Option               November 2012


2.2.1.  FQDN can be Resolved into an IP Address by the Client

   Because an FQDN can be resolved into one or a list of IP addresses,
   this is presented as an argument to encourage defining exclusively a
   FQDN option.

   This alternative does require the host embedding the client to enable
   name resolution capabilities.  This argument might be objected as
   discussed in Section 2.1.1.

2.2.2.  Some Operational Needs

   Returning a FQDN option is more convenient in some deployment
   contexts.  This is motivated by operational considerations such as a
   Service Provider considering two levels of redirection:

    (1)  The first level is national-wise and undertaken by DHCP: a
         regional-specific Name will be returned;
    (2)  The second level is done during the resolution of the regional-
         specific Name to redirect the customer to a regional
         server/service among a pool deployed regionally.


   Distinct operational teams are responsible for each of the above
   mentioned levels.  A clear separation between the functional
   perimeter of each team is a sensitive task for the maintenance of the
   offered services.

   Regional teams will require to introduce new resources to meet an
   increase of customer base.  Operations related to the introduction of
   these new devices (e.g., addressing, redirection, etc.) are
   implemented locally.  Having this regional separation provides
   flexibility to manage portions of a network operated by dedicated
   teams.

   This two-levels redirection can not be met by an IP Address option.

2.2.3.  DNS-based Load Balancing

   Some deployed services relies on DNS to distribute customers among
   available service access nodes based on load-related considerations.
   FQDN is provisioned to requesting clients.  This FQDN is then
   resolved into an IP address based on the load of available service
   access nodes.  This allows for deterministic distribution of
   customers among available service access nodes.

   The mode described in Section 2.1.1 can be adapted to interface with
   a DNS-based load-balancing engine.  Nevertheless, doing so would have

   some impacts if the node selection is deployed at regional level
   (e.g., a cluster of nodes is deployed in a regional PoP without
   requiring a central entity to enforce node selection based on the
   load of each regional cluster).  For such deployment scenario, it
   might be more simpler to enforce load-based node selection policies
   at the regional level.

   Requiring the DHCP server to interface with a DNS-based load
   distributing engine may not be acceptable for operators separating
   the delivery of (basic) network connectivity from service-related
   provisioning.


3.  Recommendation

   Section 2 identifies the arguments which are advanced in favor of
   defining options to convey an IP address while other arguments are
   also advanced to motivate the need for defining options to convey
   FQDN.  These arguments are mainly deployment-specific.  To
   accommodate the requirements of both the proponents of defining an IP
   Address option and FQDN option while considering the issues raised in
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines], an encoding recommendation is
   proposed in this section.

   New DHCP options SHOULD use either an IP-Address or FQDN encoding for
   the data.  If there is a strong requirement to support both an IP-
   Address and FQDN encoding, the option specification MUST use the
   encoding specified in this document and MUST provide the rationale to
   motivate why either an IP-Address or FQDN encoding is insufficient.

   This document defines one single option which is characterized as
   follows:

   o  The option is designed to convey a Name.
   o  The Name MUST be encoded as UTF-8 string [RFC3629].
   o  The Name MUST be a string that can be passed to getaddrinfo
      (Section 6.1 of [RFC3493]), such as a DNS name, address literals,
      etc.
   o  The Name MUST NOT contain spaces or nulls.
   o  Multiple Names MAY be included in the same option.
   o  The Name is length-encoded.
   o  The DHCP client decoding an option in this format MUST validate
      the contents of the option.  If the contents are not valid, the
      DHCP client MUST silently ignore the option.  The DHCP client MUST
      NOT attempt to process an invalid option of this type for reasons
      of compatibility with non-conforming implementations, or for any
      other reason.  A Name is considered as valid if:

      *  It is a legal UTF-8 string which does not contain any spaces
         nor nulls.
      *  It contains IPv4 address in dotted-decimal form (e.g.,
         192.0.2.33), textual representation of an IPv6 address (e.g.,
         2001:db8::1) [RFC4291] [RFC5952] or a domain name (e.g.,
         "myservice.example.com")[RFC2181].  Note:
         +  The trailing dot is optional when a domain name is conveyed
            in the option.
         +  IPv6 addresses MUST NOT be enclosed in brackets.
         +  A domain name is structured as one or more labels
            concatenated with dots.  A label MUST NOT be no more than 63
            characters.
   o  Each validated Name is passed to the name resolution library
      (e.g., Section 6.1.1 of [RFC1123] or [RFC6055]) to retrieve the
      corresponding IP address(es) (IPv4, IPv6 or both).
