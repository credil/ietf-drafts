Abstract

   This document describes uniform patterns to construct HTTP URLs that
   may be used to retrieve registration information from registries

2.  Introduction

   This document describes a specification for querying registration
   data using a RESTful web service and uniform query patterns.  The
   service is implemented using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   [RFC2616].

   The protocol described in this specification is intended to address
   deficiencies with the WHOIS protocol [RFC3912] that have been
   identified over time, including:

   o  Lack of standardized command structures,
   o  lack of standardized output and error structures,
   o  lack of support for internationalization and localization, and
   o  lack of support for user identification, authentication, and
      access control.

   The patterns described in this document purposefully do not encompass
   all of the methods employed in the WHOIS and RESTful web services of
   all of the RIRs and DNRs.  The intent of the patterns described here
   are to enable queries of:

   o  networks by IP address,
   o  autonomous system numbers by number,
   o  reverse DNS meta-data by domain,
   o  name servers by name,
   o  registrars by name, and
   o  entities (such as contacts) by identifier.

   It is envisioned that each registry will continue to maintain NICNAME
   /WHOIS and/or RESTful web services specific to their needs and those
   of their constituencies, and the information retrieved through the
   patterns described here may reference such services.

   Likewise, future IETF standards may add additional patterns for
   additional query types.  A simple pattern namespacing scheme is
   described in Section 5 to accomodate custom extensions that will not
   interfere with the patterns defined in this document or patterns
   defined in future IETF standards.

   WHOIS services, in general, are read-only services.  Therefore URL
   [RFC3986] patterns specified in this document are only applicable to
   the HTTP [RFC2616] GET and HEAD methods.

   This document does not describe the results or entities returned from
   issuing the described URLs with an HTTP GET.  JSON [RFC4627] result
   formatting and processing is described in
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response].

   Additionally, resource management, provisioning and update functions
   are out of scope for this document.  Registries have various and
   divergent methods covering these functions, and it is unlikely a
   uniform approach for these functions will ever be possible.

   HTTP contains mechanisms for servers to authenticate clients and for
   clients to authenticate servers (from which authorization schemes may
   be built) so such mechanisms are not described in this document.
   Policy, provisioning, and processing of authentication and
   authorization are out-of-scope for this document as deployments will
   have to make choices based on local criteria.  Specified
   authentication mechanisms MUST use HTTP.

3.  Path Segment Specification

   The uniform patterns start with a base URL [RFC3986] specified by
   each registry or any other service provider offering this service.
   The base URL is followed by a resource-type-specific path segment.
   The base URL may contain its own path segments (e.g. http://
   example.com/... or http://example.com/rdap/... ).  The characters
   used to form a path segment are limited to those that can be used to
   form a URI as specified in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

3.1.  Lookup Path Segment Specification

   The resource type path segments for exact match lookup are:

   o  'ip': Used to identify IP networks and associated data referenced
      using either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
   o  'autnum': Used to identify autonomous system registrations and
      associated data referenced using an AS Plain autonomous system
      number.
   o  'domain': Used to identify reverse DNS (RIR) or domain name (DNR)
      information and associated data referenced using a fully-qualified
      domain name.
   o  'nameserver': Used to identify a name server information query
      using a host name.
   o  'entity': Used to identify an entity information query using a
      string identifier.

3.1.1.  IP Network Path Segment Specification

   Syntax: ip/<IP address> or ip/<CIDR prefix>/<CIDR length>

   Queries for information about IP networks are of the form /ip/XXX/...
   or /ip/XXX/YY/...  where the path segment following 'ip' is either an
   IPv4 [RFC1166] or IPv6 [RFC5952] address (i.e. XXX) or an IPv4 or
   IPv6 CIDR [RFC4632] notation address block (i.e. XXX/YY).

Internet-Draft              RDAP Query Format               October 2013


   Semantically, the simpler form using the address can be thought of as
   a CIDR block with a bitmask length of 32 for IPv4 and a bitmask
   length of 128 for IPv6.  A given specific address or CIDR may fall
   within multiple IP networks in a hierarchy of networks, therefore
   this query targets the "most-specific" or smallest IP network which
   completely encompasses it in a hierarchy of IP networks.

   The IPv4 and IPv6 address formats supported in this query are
   described in section 3.2.2 of [RFC3986], as IPv4address and
   IPv6address ABNF definitions.  Any valid IPv6 text address format
   [RFC4291] can be used, compressed or not compressed.  The restricted
   rules to write a text representation of an IPv6 address [RFC5952] are
   not mandatory.  However, the zone id [RFC4007] is not appropriate in
   this context and therefore prohibited.

   This is an example URL for the most specific network containing
   192.0.2.0:

   /ip/192.0.2.0

   This is an example of a URL the most specific network containing
   192.0.2.0/24:

   /ip/192.0.2.0/24

   This is an example URL for the most specific network containing
   2001:db8:1:1::1:

   /ip/2001:db8:1:1::1

3.1.2.  Autonomous System Path Segment Specification

   Syntax: autnum/<autonomous system number>

   Queries for information regarding autonomous system number
   registrations are of the form /autnum/XXX/... where XXX is an AS
   Plain autonomous system number [RFC5396].  In some registries,
   registration of autonomous system numbers is done on an individual
   number basis, while other registries may register blocks of
   autonomous system numbers.  The semantics of this query are such that
   if a number falls within a range of registered blocks, the target of
   the query is the block registration, and that individual number
   registrations are considered a block of numbers with a size of 1.

   For example, to find information on autonomous system number 65551,
   the following path would be used:

   /autnum/65551

Internet-Draft              RDAP Query Format               October 2013


   The following path would be used to find information on 4-byte
   autonomous system number 65538:

   /autnum/65538

3.1.3.  Domain Path Segment Specification

   Syntax: domain/<domain name>

   Queries for domain information are of the form /domain/XXXX/...,
   where XXXX is a fully-qualified domain name [RFC4343] in either the
   in-addr.arpa or ip6.arpa zones (for RIRs) or a fully-qualified domain
   name in a zone administered by the server operator (for DNRs).
   Internationalized domain names represented in either A-label or
   U-label format [RFC5890] are also valid domain names.  IDN labels
   SHOULD NOT be represented as a mixture of A-labels and U-labels.

   If the client sends the server an IDN in U-label format, servers that
   support IDNs MUST convert the IDN into A-label format and perform
   IDNA processing as specified in RFC 5891 [RFC5891].  The server
   should perform an exact match lookup using the A-label.

   The following path would be used to find information describing the
   zone serving the network 192.0.2/24:

   /domain/2.0.192.in-addr.arpa

   The following path would be used to find information describing the
   zone serving the network 2001:db8:1::/48:

   /domain/1.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa

   The following path would be used to find information for the
   example.com domain name:

   /domain/example.com

   The following path would be used to find information for the
   xn--xemple-9ua.example IDN:

   /domain/xn--xemple-9ua.example

3.1.4.  Name Server Path Segment Specification

   Syntax: nameserver/<name server name>

   The <name server name> parameter represents a fully qualified name as
   specified in RFC 952 [RFC0952] and RFC 1123 [RFC1123].

   Internationalized names represented in either A-label or U-label
   format [RFC5890] are also valid name server names.  IDN labels SHOULD
   NOT be represented as a mixture of A-labels and U-labels.

   If the client sends the server an IDN in U-label format, servers that
   support IDNs MUST convert the IDN into A-label format and perform
   IDNA processing as specified in RFC 5891 [RFC5891].  The server
   should perform an exact match lookup using the A-label.

   The following path would be used to find information for the
   ns1.example.com name server:

   /nameserver/ns1.example.com

   The following path would be used to find information for the
   ns1.xn--xemple-9ua.example name server:

   /nameserver/ns1.xn--xemple-9ua.example

3.1.5.  Entity Path Segment Specification

   Syntax: entity/<handle>

   The <handle> parameter represents an entity (such as a contact,
   registrant, or registrar) identifier.  For example, for some DNRs
   contact identifiers are specified in RFC 5730 [RFC5730] and RFC 5733
   [RFC5733].

   The following path would be used to find information for the entity
   associated with handle CID-4005:

   /entity/CID-4005

3.1.6.  Help Path Segment Specification

   Syntax: help

   The help path segment can be used to request helpful information
   (command syntax, terms of service, privacy policy, rate limiting
   policy, supported authentication methods, supported extensions,
   technical support contact, etc.) from an RDAP server.  The response
   to "help" should provide basic information that a client needs to
   successfully use the service.  The following path would be used to
   return "help" information:

   /help

3.2.  Search Path Segment Specification

   The resource type path segments for search are:

   o  'domains': Used to identify a domain name information search using
      a pattern to match a fully-qualified domain name.
   o  'nameservers': Used to identify a name server information search
      using a pattern to match a host name.
   o  'entities': Used to identify an entity information search using a
      pattern to match a string identifier.

   RDAP search path segments are formed using a concatenation of the
   plural form of the object being searched for, a forward slash
   character ('/', ASCII value 0x002F), and an HTTP query string.  The
   HTTP query string is formed using a concatenation of the question
   mark character ('?', ASCII value 0x003F), the JSON object value
   associated with the object being searched for, the equal sign
   character ('=', ASCII value 0x003D), and the search pattern.  For the
   domain and entity objects described in this document the plural
   object forms are "domains" and "entities".

3.2.1.  Domain Search

   Syntax: domains?name=<domain search pattern>

   Searches for domain information are of the form

   /domains?name=XXXX

   where XXXX is a search pattern representing a domain name in
   "letters, digits, hyphen" format [RFC5890] in a zone administered by
   the server operator of a DNR.  The following path would be used to
   find DNR information for domain names matching the "example*.com"
   pattern:

   /domains?name=example*.com

   Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) in U-label format [RFC5890] can
   also be used as search patterns (see Section 4).  Searches for these
   names are of the form /domains?name=XXXX, where XXXX is a search
   pattern representing a domain name in U-label format [RFC5890].

3.2.2.  Name Server Search

   Syntax: nameservers?name=<nameserver search pattern>

   Searches for name server information are of the form

Internet-Draft              RDAP Query Format               October 2013


   /nameservers?name=XXXX

   where XXXX is a search pattern representing a host name in "letters,
   digits, hyphen" format [RFC5890] in a zone administered by the server
   operator of a DNR.  The following path would be used to find DNR
   information for name server names matching the "ns1.example*.com"
   pattern:

   /nameservers?name=ns1.example*.com

   Internationalized name server names in U-label format [RFC5890] can
   also be used as search patterns (see Section 4).  Searches for these
   names are of the form /nameservers?name=XXXX, where XXXX is a search
   pattern representing a name server name in U-label format [RFC5890].

3.2.3.  Entity Search

   Syntax: entities?fn=<entity name search pattern>

   Syntax: entities?handle=<entity handle search pattern>

   Searches for entity information by name are of the form

   /entities?fn=XXXX

   where XXXX is a search pattern representing an entity name as
   specified in Section 6.1 of [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response].  The
   following path would be used to find information for entity names
   matching the "Bobby Joe*" pattern.

   /entities?fn=Bobby%20Joe*

   Searches for entity information by handle are of the form

   /entities?handle=XXXX

   where XXXX is a search pattern representing an entity handle as
   specified in Section 6.1 of [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response].  The
   following path would be used to find information for entity names
   matching the "CID-40*" pattern.

   /entities?handle=CID-40*

   URLs MUST be properly encoded according to the rules of [RFC3986].
   In the example above, "Bobby Joe*" is encoded to "Bobby%20Joe*".

4.  Search Processing

Internet-Draft              RDAP Query Format               October 2013


   Partial string searching uses the asterisk ('*', ASCII value 0x002A)
   character to match zero or more trailing characters.  Additional
   pattern matching processing is beyond the scope of this
   specification.

   If a server receives a search request but cannot process the request
   because it does not support a particular style of partial match
   searching, it SHOULD return an HTTP 422 [RFC4918] error.  When
   returning a 422 error, the server MAY also return an error response
   body as specified in Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response] if
   the requested media type is one that is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-using-http].

   Because Unicode characters may be combined with another Unicode
   character or characters, partial matching is not feasible across
   combinations of Unicode characters.  Servers SHOULD NOT partially
   match combinations of Unicode characters where a Unicode character
   may be legally combined with another Unicode character or characters.
   Clients should avoid submitting a partial match search of Unicode
   characters where a Unicode character may be legally combined with
   another Unicode character or characters.  Partial match searches with
   incomplete combinations of characters where a character must be
   combined with another character or characters are invalid.  Partial
   match searches with characters that may be combined with another
   character or characters are to be considered non-combined characters
   (that is, if character x may be combined with character y but
   character y is not submitted in the search string then character x is
   a complete character and no combinations of character x are to be
   searched).

   Because Unicode characters may be combined with another Unicode
   character or characters, partial matching requires that a server
   maintain a list of valid character combinations to be considered a
   match.  When comparing DNS U-labels, servers SHOULD use the code
   points specified in [RFC5892] to determine partial matches.  When
   comparing entity names, servers SHOULD use the normalization rules
   and code points specified by [I-D.ietf-precis-nickname] to determine
   partial matches.

5.  Extensibility

   This document describes path segment specifications for a limited
   number of objects commonly registered in both RIRs and DNRs.  It does
   not attempt to describe path segments for all of the objects
   registered in all registries.  Custom path segments can be created
   for objects not specified here using the process described in
   Section 6 of "HTTP usage in the Registration Data Access Protocol
   (RDAP)" [I-D.ietf-weirds-using-http].

Internet-Draft              RDAP Query Format               October 2013


   Custom path segments can be created by prefixing the segment with a
   unique identifier followed by an underscore character (0x5F).  For
   example, a custom entity path segment could be created by prefixing
   "entity" with "custom_", producing "custom_entity".  Servers MUST
   return an appropriate failure status code for a request with an
   unrecognized path segment.

6.  Internationalization Considerations

   There is value in supporting the ability to submit either a U-label
   (Unicode form of an IDN label) or an A-label (ASCII form of an IDN
   label) as a query argument to an RDAP service.  Clients capable of
   processing non-ASCII characters may prefer a U-label since this is
   more visually recognizable and familiar than A-label strings, but
   clients using programmatic interfaces might find it easier to submit
   and display A-labels if they are unable to input U-labels with their
   keyboard configuration.  Both query forms are acceptable.

   Internationalized domain and name server names can contain character
   variants and variant labels as described in RFC 4290 [RFC4290].
   Clients that support queries for internationalized domain and name
   server names MUST accept service provider responses that describe
   variants as specified in "JSON Responses for the Registration Data
   Access Protocol" [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not specify any IANA actions.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security services for the operations specified in this document are
   described in "Security Services for the Registration Data Access
   Protocol" [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-sec].

   Search functionality typically requires more server resources (such
   as memory, CPU cycles, and network bandwidth) when compared to basic
   lookup functionality.  This increases the risk of server resource
   exhaustion and subsequent denial of service due to abuse.  This risk
   can be mitigated by developing and implementing controls to restrict
   search functionality to identified and authorized clients.  If those
   clients behave badly, their search privileges can be suspended or
   revoked.  Rate limiting as described in Section 5.5 of "HTTP usage in
   the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)"
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-using-http] can also be used to control the rate of
   received search requests.  Server operators can also reduce their
   risk by restricting the amount of information returned in response to
   a search request.
