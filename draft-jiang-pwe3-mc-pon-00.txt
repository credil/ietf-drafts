Abstract

   While MPLS is deployed further and further to the access network, a
   converging network edge point which provides both MPLS and PON access
   capability appears. To provide resiliency for its services, multi-
   homing is needed to support PON access in MPLS. This document
   describes the multi-chassis PON protection architecture in MPLS and
   also proposes the ICCP extension to support it.

3. Introduction

   MPLS is extending further and further to the edge of networks, for
   example, the seamless MPLS use cases as described in [SEAMLESS], and
   the MS-PW with PON access use case as described in [RFC6456], all
   show that MPLS is approaching the access networks.

   Passive Optical Network (PON) can provide high bandwidth of 1Gbps or
   even 10Gbps, and provide support of access for dozens to more than
   one hundred subscribers at the same time. A huge number of PON access
   networks have been deployed over the last few years with the wide
   spread of FTTx technology.

   With the fast growth of mobile data traffic, more and more LTE small
   cells and Wi-Fi hotspots will be deployed in the future. How to
   backhaul a large number of small cells or hotspots will pose a great
   challenge to mobile service providers.

   PON access technology has the following advantages:

   -saving trunk fibers with its point-to-multipoint physical topology;

   -High bandwidth capability up to 10Gbps;

   -Low Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

   PON also provides synchronization features, e.g., SyncE and IEEE1588
   functionality, which can fulfill synchronization needs of mobile
   backhaul services. Some optical layer of protection mechanisms, such
   as Type B protection and Type C protection are also specified [G983.1]
   to avoid single point of failure in the access.

   Therefore, PON may play a greater role in the access end for the
   mobile backhaul networks. Providing OLTs with MPLS functionality
   further facilitates multi-service convergence.

   Type B protection architecture is an economical PON resiliency
   mechanism, where the working OLT and the working link between the
   working splitter and the working OLT (i.e., the working fiber) is
   protected by a redundant protection OLT and a redundant fiber between
   the working splitter and the protection OLT. This is different from
   the more complex and costly Type C protection architecture where
   working splitter and the working fibers from ONUs to the working
   splitter are further protected. Figure 1 demonstrates a typical
   scenario of Type B PON protection.

   Though the above PON architecture provides redundancy in its physical
   topology, some standard mechanisms are needed to exchange PON link
   status and network status between OLTs in a Redundancy Group (RG) so
   that protection and restoration can be done reliably, especially when
   the OLTs also support MPLS. Thus there is a need for Multi-chassis
   PON protection protocol in MPLS.

   ICCP [ICCP] provides a framework for inter-chassis synchronization of
   state and configuration data between a set of two or more PEs.
   Currently ICCP only defines application specific messages for PW
   redundancy and mLACP, but it can be easily extended to support Type B
   PON as an Attachment Circuit (AC) redundancy.

   This document proposes the extension of ICCP to support Multi-chassis
   PON protection in MPLS.

4. Dual Homing protection procedures

   Two typical MPLS protection network architectures for PON access are
   depicted in Fig.2 and Fig.3 (PON access segment is the same as in
   Fig.1 and thus omitted for simplification). OLTs with MPLS
   functionality are connected to a single PE (Fig.2) or dual home PEs
   (Fig.3) respectively, thus these devices constitute an MPLS network
   which provides PW transport services between ONUs and a CE.

   Faults may be encountered in PON access, or in the MPLS network
   (including the working OLT). Procedures for these cases are described
   in this section (it is assumed that both OLTs and PEs are working in
   independent mode of PW redundancy [RFC6870]).

4.1. Protection procedure upon PON interface failures

   When a fault is detected on a working PON link, a working OLT MUST
   turn off its associated PON interface and MUST send an LDP
   notification message with a forward defect indication and with the
   Request Switchover bit being set to its peer PE on the remote end of
   the PW.  At the same time, the working OLT MUST send an ICCP message
   with PON State TLV to notify the backup OLT of the PON fault.
   Upon receiving a PON state TLV where Local PON Port state is False,
   an OLT in the protection mode MUST activate the protection PON link
   in the protection group.


4.2. Protection procedure upon PW failures

   Usually MPLS networks have its own protection mechanism such as LSP
   protection or Fast Reroute (FRR). But in a link sparse access or
   aggregation network where protection is impossible in LSP layer, the
   following PW layer protection procedures can be enabled.

   When a fault is detected on its working PW (e.g., by VCCV BFD), a
   working OLT MUST turn off its associated PON interface and MUST send
   an ICCP message with PON State TLV to notify the backup OLT of the
   PON fault.

   Upon receiving a PON state TLV where Local PON Port state is False,
   the backup OLT MUST activate its optical interface to the backup
   fiber. At the same time, the backup OLT MUST send a PW redundancy
   message to the remote PE, so that traffic can be switched to the
   backup PW.

4.3. Protection procedure upon the working OLT failure

   If the backup OLT lost connection to the working OLT, it MUST
   activate its optical interface to the back fiber and activate the
   specific backup PW upon receiving a PW redundancy message from its
   remote PE with the Request Switchover bit being set, so that traffic
   can be reliably switched to the protection link and the backup PW.
