Internet-Draft             RADIUS IPv6 Access              February 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies additional RADIUS attributes used to support
   configuration of DHCPv6 and/or ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA)
   parameters on a per-user basis.  The attributes, which complement
   those defined in [RFC3162] and [RFC4818], support the following:

   o  Assignment of specific IPv6 addresses to hosts via DHCPv6.

   o  Assignment of an IPv6 DNS server address, via DHCPv6 or Router
      Advertisement [RFC6106].

   o  Configuration of more specific routes to be announced to the user
      via the Route Information Option defined in [RFC4191] Section 2.3.

   o  The assignment of a named delegated prefix pool for use with "IPv6
      Prefix Options for DHCPv6" [RFC3633].

   o  The assignment of a named stateful address pool for use with
      DHCPv6 stateful address assignment [RFC3315].


2.  Deployment Scenarios

   The extensions in this draft are intended to be applicable across a
   wide variety of network access scenarios where RADIUS is involved.
   One such typical network scenario is illustrated in Figure 1.  It is
   composed of a IP Routing Residential Gateway (RG) or host, a Layer 2
   Access-Node (AN) e.g. a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer -
   DSLAM, an IP Network Access Servers (NASes), and an Authentication
   Authorization & Accounting (AAA) server.

Internet-Draft             RADIUS IPv6 Access              February 2013


   In the depicted scenario the NAS may utilize an IP address
   configuration protocol (e.g. a DHCPv6 server) to handle address
   assignment to RGs/hosts.  The RADIUS server authenticates each RG/
   host and returns to the attributes used for authorization and
   accounting.  These attributes can include a host's IPv6 address, a
   DNS server address and a set of IPv6 routes to be advertised via any
   suitable protocol, eg ICMPv6 (Neighbour Discovery).  The name of a
   prefix pool to be used for DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation, or the name of
   an address pool to be used for DHCPv6 address assignment can also be
   attributes provided to the NAS by the RADIUS AAA server.

   The following sub-sections discuss how these attributes are used in
   more detail.

2.1.  IPv6 Address Assignment

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides a mechanism to assign one or more non-
   temporary IPv6 addresses to hosts.  To provide a DHCPv6 server
   residing on a NAS with one or more IPv6 addresses to be assigned,
   this document specifies the Framed-IPv6-Address Attribute.

   While [RFC3162] permits an IPv6 address to be specified via the
   combination of the Framed-Interface-Id and Framed-IPv6-Prefix
   attributes, this separation is more natural for use with PPP's IPv6
   Control Protocol than it is for use with DHCPv6, and the use of a
   single IPv6 address attribute makes for easier processing of
   accounting records.

   Since DHCPv6 can be deployed on the same network as ICMPv6 stateless
   (SLAAC) [RFC4862], it is possible that the NAS will require both
   stateful and stateless configuration information.  Therefore it is
   possible for the Framed-IPv6-Address, Framed-IPv6-Prefix and Framed-
   Interface-Id attributes [RFC3162] to be included within the same
   packet.  To avoid ambiguity in this case, the Framed-IPv6-Address
   attribute is intended for authorization and accounting of DHCPv6-
   assigned addresses and the Framed-IPv6-Prefix and Framed-Interface-Id
   attributes used for authorization and accounting of addresses
   assigned via SLAAC.

2.2.  DNS Servers

   DHCPv6 provides an option for configuring a host with the IPv6
   address of a DNS server.  The IPv6 address of a DNS server can also
   be conveyed to the host using ICMPv6 with Router Advertisements, via
   the [RFC6106] option.  To provide the NAS with the IPv6 address of a
   DNS server, this document specifies the DNS-Server-IPv6-Address
   Attribute.

Internet-Draft             RADIUS IPv6 Access              February 2013


2.3.  IPv6 Route Information

   An IPv6 Route Information option, defined in [RFC4191] is intended to
   be used to inform a host connected to the NAS that a specific route
   is reachable via any given NAS.

   This document specifies the RADIUS attribute that allows the AAA
   server to provision the announcement by the NAS of a specific Route
   Information Option to an accessing host.  The NAS may advertise this
   route using the method defined in [RFC4191], or using other
   equivalent methods.  Any other information, such as preference or
   life-time values, that is to be present in the actual announcement
   using a given method is assumed to be determined by the NAS using
   means not scoped by this document (e.g.  Local configuration on the
   NAS).

   While the Framed-IPv6-Prefix attribute defined in [RFC3162] Section
   2.3 causes the route to be advertised in an RA, it cannot be used to
   configure more specific routes.  While the Framed-IPv6-Route
   attribute defined in [RFC3162] Section 2.5 causes the route to be
   configured on the NAS, and potentially announced via an IP routing
   protocol, depending on the value of Framed-Routing, it does not
   result in the route being announced in an RA.

2.4.  Delegated IPv6 Prefix Pool

   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) [RFC3633] involves a delegating
   router selecting a prefix and delegating it on a temporary basis to a
   requesting router.  The delegating router may implement a number of
   strategies as to how it chooses what prefix is to be delegated to a
   requesting router, one of them being the use of a local named prefix
   pool.  The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool attribute allows the RADIUS
   server to convey a prefix pool name to a NAS hosting a DHCPv6-PD
   server and acting as a delegating router.

   Since DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation can be used with SLAAC on the same
   network, it is possible for the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool and
   Framed-IPv6-Pool attributes to be included within the same packet.
   To avoid ambiguity in this scenario, use of the Delegated-IPv6-
   Prefix-Pool attribute should be restricted to authorization and
   accounting of prefix pools used in DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation and the
   Framed-IPv6-Pool attribute should be used for authorization and
   accounting of prefix pools used in SLAAC.

2.5.  Stateful IPv6 address pool

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides a mechanism to assign one or more non-
   temporary IPv6 addresses to hosts.  Section 3.1 introduces the

   Framed-IPv6-Address attribute to be used for providing a DHCPv6
   server residing on a NAS with one or more IPv6 addresses to be
   assigned to the clients.  An alternative way to achieve a similar
   result is for the NAS to select the IPv6 address to be assigned from
   an address pool configured for this purpose on the NAS.  This
   document specifies the Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool attribute to allow
   the RADIUS server to convey a pool name to be used for such stateful
   DHCPv6 based addressing, and any subsequent accounting.


3.  Attributes

   The fields shown in the diagrams below are transmitted from left to
   right.

3.1.  Framed-IPv6-Address

   This attribute indicates an IPv6 address that is assigned to the NAS-
   facing interface of the RG/host.  It MAY be used in Access-Accept
   packets, and MAY appear multiple times.  It MAY be used in an Access-
   Request packet as a hint by the NAS to the RADIUS server that it
   would prefer these IPv6 address(es), but the RADIUS server is not
   required to honor the hint.  Since it is assumed that the NAS will
   add a route corresponding to the address, it is not necessary for the
   RADIUS server to also send a host Framed-IPv6-Route attribute for the
   same address.

   This attribute can be used by a DHCPv6 process on the NAS to assign a
   unique IPv6 address to the RG/host.

   A summary of the Framed-IPv6-Address attribute format is shown below.
   The format of the address is as per [RFC3162].

3.2.  DNS-Server-IPv6-Address

   The DNS-Server-IPv6-Address attribute contains the IPv6 address of a
   DNS server.  This attribute MAY be included multiple times in Access-
   Accept packets, when the intention is for a NAS to announce more than
   one DNS server addresses to a RG/host.  The same order of the
   attributes is expected to be followed in the announcements to the
   RADIUS client.  The attribute MAY be used in an Access-Request packet
   as a hint by the NAS to the RADIUS server regarding the DNS IPv6
   address, but the RADIUS server is not required to honor the hint.

   The content of this attribute can be inserted in a DHCPv6 option as
   specified in [RFC3646] or in an IPv6 Router Advertisment as per
   [RFC6106].

   Type

      TBA4 for Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool

   Length

      Length in bytes.  At least 3.

   String

      The string field contains the name of an assigned IPv6 prefix pool
      configured on the NAS.  The field is not NULL (hexadecimal 00)
      terminated.

   Note: The string data type is as documented in [RFC6158], and carries
   binary data that is external to the Radius protocol, eg the name of a
   pool of prefixes configured on the NAS.

3.5.  Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool

   This attribute contains the name of an assigned pool that SHOULD be
   used to select an IPv6 address for the user on the NAS.  If a NAS
   does not support address pools, the NAS MUST ignore this attribute.
   A summary of the Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool attribute format is shown
   below.  It MAY be used in an Access-Request packet as a hint by the
   NAS to the RADIUS server regarding the pool, but the RADIUS server is
   not required to honor the hint.

   Type

      TBA5 for Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool

   Length

      Length in bytes.  At least 3.

   String

      The string field contains the name of an assigned IPv6 stateful
      address pool configured on the NAS.  The field is not NULL
      (hexadecimal 00) terminated.

   Note: The string data type is as documented in [RFC6158], and carries
   binary data that is external to the Radius protocol, eg the name of a
   pool of addresses configured on the NAS.

3.6.  Table of attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.  The optional
   inclusion of the options in Access Request messages is intended to
   allow for a network access server (NAS) to provide the RADIUS server
   with a hint of the attributes in advance of user authentication,
   which may be useful in cases where a user re-connects or has a static
   address.  The server is under no obligation to honor such hints.

4.  Diameter Considerations

   Given that the attributes defined in this document are allocated from
   the standard RADIUS type space (see Section 6), no special handling
   is required by Diameter entities.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies additional IPv6 RADIUS attributes useful in
   residential broadband network deployments.  In such networks, the
   RADIUS protocol may run either over IPv4 or over IPv6 and known
   security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol, e.g.  [SECI], apply
   to the attributes defined in this document.  A trust relationship
   between a NAS and RADIUS server is expected to be in place, with
   communication optionally secured by IPSec or TLS [RFC6614] .


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the assignment of five new RADIUS attribute
   types in the "Radius Types" registry (currently located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types for the following
   attributes:

   o  Framed-IPv6-Address

   o  DNS-Server-IPv6-Address

   o  Route-IPv6-Information

   o  Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool

   o  Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool
