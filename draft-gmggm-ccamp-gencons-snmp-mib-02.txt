      A SNMP MIB to manage GMPLS with General Constraints support
                 draft-gmggm-ccamp-gencons-snmp-mib-02

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for GMPLS based
   networks.

   In particular in the context Wavelength Switching Optical Network
   (WSON) two sets of information were defined: a general constrains set
   (reusable by other technologies) and a WSON specific set.  This
   document defines a MIB module for supporting general constrain
   information.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in GMPLS networks
   in patricular for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON) as
   defined in [RFC6163].

   Those extensions were divided in two parts: generic constrains (as
   they can be easily applied to other technologies) and WSON specific
   contraints.  This document aim to defines MIBs extentions to conver

   only the generic constrain part.  The WSON specific MIB extentions
   will be covered by a separate document
   [I-D.gmggm-ccamp-wson-snmp-mib].

   As such, document [I-D.ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode] defines
   specific TLVs while [RFC6825] implement OSPF-TE related extentions.
   This MIB document aim to cover information defined in those general
   constrain drafts.

   [EDITOR NOTE] Very early draft to start MIB activity on GMPSL-WSON
   related extentions and collect feedback from working group.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] In
   the description of OIDs the convention: Set (S) Get (G) and Trap (T)
   conventions will describe the action allowed by the paramenter.

4.  Overview

   Regarding exsting GMPLS MIBs modules, since the TED module [RFC6825]
   already provide and extention to previous GMPLS modules, we provide
   here a direct extention to it.  Additional GMPLS MIB modules this
   document uses are [RFC4802] and [RFC4803].

   Current GMPLS MIBs are covered by several documents.  The most
   important to refererence here are the [RFC4802] and [RFC4803].  Most
   recent works on GMPLS MIBs is in [RFC6825], whenever possible this
   document will reuse the same approach.

Internet-Draft         GMPLS General Constrain MIB             July 2013


   General constrains can be classified in two broads categories: link
   information (as other GMPLS TED information) and Node information
   (this is different from what currently available).  For link
   information the most similar definions are the ones from [RFC4803]
   where the label table is defined.  For node information however, new
   specific information has to be defined.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   Modules defined here provide additional information to existing GMPLS
   MIBS in order to represent the general constrains information as
   reported in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode].  This module
   is organized into two tables as reported in the following sub
   sections.

5.1.  gmplsGenConsAvailableLabelsTable

   This object represent the Labels availability as defined by
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode] section 2.3.  This
   information may be introduced by specific technologies but is
   represented in a general form.  An application example is [draft-
   ietf-ccamp-wson-signal-compatibility-ospf] that advertise such
   information under its specific ISC values.

   The table entry is composed by:

   o  gmplsGenConsLabelIndex (type: Unsigned 32)

   o  gmplgGenConsLabelInterface (type: typesInterfaceIndexOrZero)

   o  gmplsGenConsISCD (type: IANAGmplsSwitchingTypeTC needs to be
      properly extended).
      [EDITOR NOTE1: could we assume that ISCD=151 for WSON hence the
      associated label follows RFC6205.  Likely flexgrid will have the
      same constrain.]
      [EDITOR NOTE2: we could probably add an index reference to the
      tedSwCabTable so we have all switching capability info through one
      pointer.]

   o  gmplsGenConsLabelValue (type: a value that might be greater than
      32 bits, not sure about max length).  Value format may vary upon
      the ISCD however the generic label format defined in the past
      still apply.  A type might be reused could be
      (gmplsLabelPortWavelength Unsigned32) defined in GMPLS LSR MIB.
      However we need to support labels bigger than 32 bits.

   Depending on switching capability available on an interface, this
   table MUST initialized with all possible available labels values.  As

   long an tunnels are created and labels are used, the existing
   gmplsLabelTable defined in [RFC4803], is filled up while entries are
   removed from this gmplsGenConsAvailableLabelsTable.

5.2.  gmplsGenConsSharedBackupLabelsTable

   The purpose of shared backup labels is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode].  As in the previous case
   the information is advertised through the specific ISCD.

   The entry for this table is equal to definitions in Section 5.1 hence
   we have the same table format.

5.3.  gmplsGenConsConnMatrixTable

   The Connectivity Matrix indicates the Node constraints introduced by
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode] as additional constrains
   compared to link/label constrains.

   The table entry shall have the following information:

   o  An identifier of the local node.  E.g. tedLocalRouterId (type:
      TedRouterIdTC).

   o  Connectivity Matrix Type (1: RWA, 2: Optical Impairments)

   o  Connectivity Matrix ID: the unique identifier for the current
      connectivity matrix.  Type: integer.

   o  Link Ingress: (Type: TedLinkIndexTC) the link identifier for the
      ingress link (ingress and egress link identify a possible
      connectivty for the node).

   o  Link Egress: (Type: TedLinkIndexTC) the link identifier for the
      egress link (ingress and egress link indentify a possible
      connectivty for the node).

5.4.  gmplsGenConsPortLabelRestrictionTable

   This table the port label constraints introduced by
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode] as an additional
   constrains on the port or vs permitted labels.  This constrains
   related to the connectivity matrix (from previous section) and are
   advertised through
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-gmpls-general-constraints-ospf-te].

   The entry for this table has the following elements:

   o  An identifier for the local node.  E.g. tedLocalRouterId (type:
      TedRouterIdTC).

   o  Connectivity matrix id: an index in the previous table

   o  Restriction Type (Values: 0 Simple Label, 1 Channel Count, 2 Label
      Range1, 3 Simple Label and Channel Count, 4 Link Label
      Exclusivity)

   o  Label Set: used depending on restriction type

   o  Max Channel Count / Max Label Set (Integer): used depending on
      restriction type

   o  Link Set: used depending on restrictio type

8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   Option #1:

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }


   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, an internet
   draft MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in an internet draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
