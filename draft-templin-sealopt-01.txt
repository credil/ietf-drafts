                    The SEAL IPv6 Destination Option
                      draft-templin-sealopt-01.txt

Abstract

   The Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) provides a
   mid-layer header designed for the encapsulation of an inner network
   layer packet within outer network layer headers.  SEAL also supports
   a transport mode of operation, where the inner payload corresponds to
   an ordinary transport layer payload.  However, SEAL can also provide
   benefit when used as an IPv6 destination option that contains a
   digital signature inserted by the source.  The source can thereafter
   use the signature to verify that any ICMPv6 messages received
   actually came from a router on the path, while destinations that
   share a secret key with the source can verify the signature to ensure
   data origin authentication.

1.  Introduction

   The Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL)
   [I-D.templin-intarea-seal] provides a mid-layer encapsulation
   designed for the encapsulation of an inner network layer packet
   within outer network layer headers, i.e., in a very similar manner as
   for GRE [RFC1701] and IPsec AH [RFC4302].  SEAL also supports a
   transport mode of operation, where the encapsulated payload
   corresponds to an ordinary transport layer protocol payload.

   However, SEAL can also provide benefit when used as an IPv6
   destination option [RFC2460] that contains a digital signature
   inserted by the source.  The source can thereafter use the signature
   to verify that any ICMPv6 messages [RFC4443] received actually came
   from a router on the path, while destinations that share a secret key
   with the source can verify the signature to ensure data origin
   authentication.


2.  SEAL IPv6 Destination Option

   The SEAL IPv6 destination option can be inserted in either a "short
   form" or a "long form".  In short form, the option includes a digital
   signature.  In long form the option also includes an Identification
   value useful for anti-replay sequencing.  The short form is formatted
   as shown in Figure 1:

                                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                      |  Option Type  | Opt Data Len=4|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                           Signature                           |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        Figure 1: SEAL IPv6 Destination Option Format - Short Form

   Option Type (8)  an 8-bit field that encodes the destination option
      code for SEAL, with the value '00' in the high-order two bits.

   Option Data Length (8)  an 8-bit length of the option data field
      measured in octets.  Set to 4 in short format, and set to 8 in
      long format.

   Digital Signature (32)
      a 32-bit digital signature.  When a cryptographic signature is
      used, covers the leading 128 bytes of the packet beginning with
      the destination option header (or up to the end of the packet).
      The value 128 is chosen so that at least the IPv6 extension
      headers and the leading portion of the inner packet are covered by

      the signature.

   The long form is formatted as shown in Figure 2
                                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                      |  Option Type  | Opt Data Len=8|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                           Signature                           |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                        Identification                         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         Figure 2: SEAL IPv6 Destination Option Format - Long Form

   Identification (32)
      a 32-bit per-packet identification field.  Set to a monotonically-
      incrementing 32-bit value for each packet transmitted, beginning
      with 0.

   The IPv6 source inserts a SEAL destination option when it needs to
   ensure that any resulting ICMPv6 error messages came from a router on
   the path and not from an off-path attacker.  When the source receives
   an ICMPv6 error message, it verifies that the signature is correct.
   When a cryptographic signature is used, the source calculates the
   signature over the leading 128 bytes of the packet based on a secret
   hashing algorithm of its choosing.  The source should choose a
   hashing algorithm that would make it extremely difficult for an off-
   path attacker to guess.

   The destination may or may not recognize the SEAL destination option.
   If the destination does not recognize the option, it skips the option
   and processes the next option.  If the destination recognizes the
   option (and if the option contains a cryptographic signature), the
   destination may either verify or ignore the signature according to
   its configuration.  If the destination is configured to verify the
   signature, then it should accept the packet if the signature is
   correct and discard the packet if the signature is incorrect.


3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is instructed to allocate an IPv6 destination option for
   SEAL, with the value '00' in the high-order two bits.


4.  Security Considerations

   The source can use the SEAL destination option to verify that ICMPv6
   messages were delivered by an on-path router and not an off-path

   attacker.  The signature may also be useful for other authenticating
   purposes, e.g., if the destination shares a secret key with the
   source.  The packet identification field may also be useful for anti-
   replay sequencing.


5.  Acknowledgments

   This work was motivated by recent discussions on the 6man mailing
   list, and build on earlier investigations with SEAL.  Sreenatha Setty
   provided valuable comments that helped clarify aspects of the
   document.
