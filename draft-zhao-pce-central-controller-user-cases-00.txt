 The User cases for Using PCE as the Central Controller(PCECC) of LSPs
            draft-zhao-pce-central-controller-user-cases-00

Abstract

   In certain deployment networks deployment scenarios, service
   providers would like to keep all the existing MPLS functionalities in
   both MPLS and GMPLS network while removing the complexity of existing
   signaling protocols such as LDP and RSVP-TE.  In this document, we
   propose to use the PCE as a central controller so that LSP can be
   calculated/signaled/initiated/downloaded through a centralized PCE
   server to each network devices along the LSP path while leveraging
   the existing PCE technologies as much as possible.

   This draft describes the user cases for using the PCE as the central
   controller where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated/downloaded
   through extending the existing PCE architectures and extending the PCEP.

1.  Introduction

   In certain network deployment scenarios, service providers would like
   to have the ability to dynamically adapt to a wide range of
   customer's requests for the sake of flexible network service
   delivery, SDN has provides additional flexibility in how the network
   is operated comparing the traditional network.

   The existing networking ecosystem has become awfully complex and
   highly demanding in terms of robustness, performance, scalability,
   flexibility, agility, etc.  By migrating to the SDN enabled network
   from the existing network, service providers and network operators
   must have a solution which they can evolve easily from the existing
   network into the SDN enabled network while keeping the network
   services remain scalable, guarantee robustness and availability etc.

   Taking the smooth transition between traditional network and the new
   SDN enabled network into account, especially from a cost impact
   assessment perspective, using the existing PCE components from the
   current network to function as the central controller of the SDN
   network is one choice, which not only achives the goal of having a
   centralized controller to provide the functionalities needed for the
   central controller, but also leverages the existing PCE network
   components.

   The Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform route
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
   PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP Setup in a Stateful PCE Model
   draft [I-D. draft-ietf-pce- stateful-pce] describes a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable active control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS
   tunnels.

   [I-D. draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] describes the setup and
   teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the active stateful PCE model,
   without the need for local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing
   for a dynamic MPLS network that is centrally controlled and deployed.

   [I-D.draft-ali-pce-remote-initiated-gmpls-lsp-01] complements [I-D.
   draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] by addressing the requirements
   for remote-initiated GMPLS LSPs.

   SR technology leverages the source routing and tunneling paradigms.
   A source node can choose a path without relying on hop-by-hop
   signaling protocols such as LDP or RSVP-TE.  Each path is specified
   as a set of "segments" advertised by link-state routing protocols
   (IS-IS or OSPF).  [I-D.filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing] provides an
   introduction to SR technology.  The corresponding IS-IS and OSPF

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                     October 2013


   extensions are specified in [I-D.previdi-isis-segment-routing-
   extensions] and [I-D.psenak-ospf-segment-routing-extensions],
   respectively.

   A Segment Routed path (SR path) can be derived from an IGP Shortest
   Path Tree (SPT).  Segment Routed Traffic Engineering paths (SR-TE
   paths) may not follow IGP SPT.  Such paths may be chosen by a
   suitable network planning tool and provisioned on the source node of
   the SR-TE path.

   It is possible to use a stateful PCE for computing one or more SR-TE
   paths taking into account various constraints and objective
   functions.  Once a path is chosen, the stateful PCE can instantiate
   an SR-TE path on a PCC using PCEP extensions specified in
   [I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] using the SR specific PCEP
   extensions described in [I-D.draft-sivabalan-pce-segment-routing].

   By using the solutions provided from above drafts, LSP in both MPLS
   and GMPLS network can be setup/delete/maintained/synchronized through
   a centrally controlled dynamic MPLS network.  Since in these
   solutions, the LSP is need to be signaled through the head end LER to
   the tail end LER, there are either RSVP-TE signaling protocol need to
   be deployed in the MPLS/GMPLS network, or extend TGP protocol with
   node/adjacency segment identifiers signaling capability to be
   deployed.

   The PCECC solution proposed in this document allow for a dynamic MPLS
   network that is eventually controlled and deployed without the
   deployment of RSVP-TE protocol or extended IGP protocol with node/
   adjacency segment identifiers signaling capability while providing
   all the key MPLS functionalities needed by the service providers.  In
   the case that one LSP path consists legacy network nodes and the new
   network nodes which are centrally controlled, the PCECC solution
   provides a smooth transition step for users.

1.1.   Using the PCE as the Central Controller (PCECC) Approach

   With PCECC, it not only removes the existing MPLS signaling totally
   from the control plane without losing any existing MPLS
   functionalities, but also PCECC achives this goal through utilizing
   the existing PCEP without introducing a new protocol into the
   network.

   The following diagram illustrates the PCECC architecture.

   Through the draft, we call the combination of the functionality for
   global label range signaling and the functionality of LSP setup/
   download/cleanup using the combination of global labels and local
   labels as PCECC functionality.

1.2.   MPLS Label Resource Reservation through PCECCP

   Current MPLS label has local meaning.  That is, MPLS label allocated
   locally and signaled through the LDP/RSVP-TE/BGP etc dynamic
   signaling protocol.

   As the SDN(Service-Driven Network) technology develops, MPLS global
   label has been proposed again for new solutions.  [I-D.li-mpls-
   global-label-usecases] proposes possible usecases of MPLS global
   label.  MPLS global label can be used for identification of the
   location, the service and the network in different application
   scenarios.  From these usecases we can see that no matter SDN or
   traditional application scenarios, the new solutions based on MPLS
   global label can gain advantage over the existing solutions to
   facilitate service provisions.

   To ease the label allocation and signaling mechanism, also with the
   new applications such as concentrated LSP controller is introduced,
   PCE can be conveniently used as a central controller and MPLS global
   label range negotiator.

   The later section of this draft describes the user cases for PCE

   server and PCE clients to have the global label range negotiation and
   local label range negotiation functionality.

1.3.   Using PCECCP to Distribute the LSP Forwarding Entry from PCECC
      server to each PCECC clients

   To empower networking with centralized controllable modules, there
   are many choices for downloading the forwarding entries to the data
   plane, one way is the use of the OpenFlow protocol, which helps
   devices populate their forwarding tables according to a set of
   instructions to the data plane.  There are other andidate protocols
   to convey specific configuration information towards devices also.
   Since the PCEP protocol is already deployed in some of the service
   network, to leverave the PCEP to populated the MPLS forwarding table
   is a possible good choice.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   IGP:  Interior Gateway Protocol.  Either of the two routing
      protocols, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Intermediate System
      to Intermediate System (IS-IS).

   PCC:  Path Computation Client: any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   TE:  Traffic Engineering.

3.  PCEP Requirements

   Following key requirements associated PCECC should be considered when
   designing the PCECC based solution:

   1.  Path Computation Element (PCE) clients supporting this draft MUST
       have the capability to advertise its PCECC capability to the
       PCECC.

   2.  Path Computation Element (PCE) supporting this draft MUST have
       the capability to negotiate a global label range for a group of
       clients.

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                     October 2013


   3.  Path Computation Client (PCC) MUST be able ask for global label
       range assigned in path request message .

   4.  PCE are not required to support label reserve service.
       Therefore, it MUST be possible for a PCE to reject a Path
       Computation Request message with a reason code that indicates no
       support for label reserve service.

   5.  PCEP SHOULD provide a means to return global label range and LSP
       label assignments of the computed path in the reply message.

   6.  PCEP SHOULD provide a means to download the MPLS forwarding entry
       to the PCECC's clients.

   o  Node1 sends a path request message for LSP setup to Node5.

   o  PCE sends a reply message for LSP setup with path (node1, i1),
      (node2, i2), (node-PCECC, if33), (node-PCECC, if55), Nnode5.

   o  PCE sends an indication message for LSP segment setup with
      [Label(toN5), Node5] for node3 to node4.

   o  Node1, Node2, Node-PCECC, Node-PCECC, Node 5 will setup the LSP to
      Node5 normally using the local label as normal.  After the LSP is
      setup, then the PCECC will program the node 3 and node 4 to
      replace the LSP segment from node3-node-pcecc-node5 to node3-
      node4-node5.

7.   Using Extended PCEP to download LSP infor for Each Network Device

   The existing PCEP is used to communicate between the PCE server and
   PCE's client PCC for exchanging the path request and reply
   information regarding to the LSP info.  With minor extensions, we can
   use the PCEP to download the complete LSP forwarding entries for each
   node in the network.

   In the example 4, the LSP segment between node3 and node4 for
   destination node5 is setup from PCECC and downloaded into node3 and
