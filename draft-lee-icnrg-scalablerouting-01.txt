Abstract

   This memo describes a scalable Route-By-Name Routing scheme for ICN.
   [ICN Challenges] describes three possible routing schemes: Route-By-
   Name Routing (RBNR), Lookup-By-Name Routing (LBNR), and Hybrid
   Routing (HR). Among them, RBNR has advantages in terms of performance
   and evolvability but scalability is a challenging issue. This memo
   proposes a RBNR scheme using hierarchically-organized name space for
   the scalability.

1. Introduction

   [ICN Challenges] identified 3 steps in ICN routing, such as name
   resolution, discovery, and delivery. Route-By-Name Routing has
   advantage in terms of performance because it can omit the first step.
   Also, RBNR is preferred in the context of evolvability because the
   name can be independent from underlying technologies. In RBNR, the
   primary issue to be addressed is the scalability as described in [ICN
   Challenges]. In this memo, we propose scalable RBNR routing mechanism

   using hierarchical name. With the hierarchical name, the routing
   table can be aggregated to the manageable size.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)
   indicates a compliance requirement statement using the key words
   listed above. This convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying
   or finding the explicit compliance requirements of this RFC.

3. Assumptions

   o "Name" has a structure similar to URI.

   o Following Procedures are occurred within an administrative domain.

4. Functional details

4.1. Hierarchical name space

   In this scheme, each "name segment" which comprises "name" represents
   a contents provider. Let us suppose an example such as
   "/Movieshop/Action/Sf/Superman". In this example "Movieshop",
   "Action", and "Sf" represents a contents provider, and "Superman"
   represents content itself.

   To build aggregated routing table, each content provider has a hash
   of its public key as its "ID" which has fixed length. Therefore, name
   of data object can be described as follows:

   o ID of content provider "Movieshop": HV1

   o ID of content provider "Action": HV2

   o ID of content provider "Sf": HV4

   o "/Movieshop/Action/Sf/Superman" => "HV1:HV2:HV4:Superman"

   The concatenation of IDs can play role of "locator".

4.2. Building routing table

   As described in 4.1. each contents provider has ID and uses the
   concatenation of hierarchically consecutive IDs as "locator" (For
   example, locator for Sf is "HV1:HV2:HV4", we call this as "Fully
   Qualified Locator (FQL)"). In this scheme we use this locator as
   "key" used to look up routing table entry, and to reduce the size of
   routing table link-state routing protocol with LSA filtering is
   adopted. By using LSA filtering the size of topology graph and
   routing table can be reduced.

   LSA filtering rule is like follows:

   o To router at tier N-1: Blocks LSAs from tier N, instead the
      locator of router at tier N is forwarded.

   o To router at tier N: LSAs from tier N-1 are injected. Among the
      peer routers of tier N, each of them forwards all LSAs that it has
      to the all the other peer routers.

   o To router at tier N+1: All LSAs including ones from tier N-1 are
      injected



   For example, some routing tables for Figure 1 are described as
   follow:

   o Movieshop (Tier 1):

4.3. Packet format

   +--------------------------------------------------+
   | General network layer header (IPv4, IPv6, etc..) |
   +--------------------------------------------------+
   | "name" described as "locator (FQL)"              |
   +--------------------------------------------------+


4.4. Discovery & Delivery

   o When a user specifies a "name" like URI, it is transformed into
      "locator (FQL)" format described previously.

   o This "request" is forwarded to the default gateway (e.g. any
      router in Figure 1).

   o When a default gateway (router) receives the request, it retrieves
      "locator" from packet header, and looks up routing table with it.

   o If matched entry is found, the request is forwarded to the next
      hop of it.

   o When the request arrives at the last "name segment", the data
      object is forwarded by means of bread-crumbs routing [BREADCRUMBS].
