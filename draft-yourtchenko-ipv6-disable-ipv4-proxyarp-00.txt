Disable "Proxy ARP for Everything" on IPv4 link-local in the presence of
                          IPv6 global address
            draft-yourtchenko-ipv6-disable-ipv4-proxyarp-00

Abstract

   rfc3927 defines the behavior "Proxy ARP for Everything" in case the
   only address present on the host is IPv4 link-local.  However, it
   does not specify anything about the presence or absence of IPv6
   global addressing.  This results in the hosts assuming it has both
   IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity in the scenario where the host itself is
   dualstack-enabled, but the network supplies only IPv6 configuration
   information.  Some implementations in this case may decide to use
   IPv4, which results in long connection delays.  This document
   proposes to avoid the "Proxy ARP for Everything" behavior if the host
   has been assigned an IPv6 address.

1.  Introduction

   Section 2.6.2 of Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses
   [RFC3927] says: "In the case of a device with a single interface and
   only a Link-Local IPv4 address, this requirement can be paraphrased
   as "ARP for everything"."

   In the case of dualstack-enabled host, which is only supplied the
   IPv6 configuration from the network, this behavior still causes the
   application layers to believe that they have both IPv4 and IPv6
   connectivity.

   This results in undesirable behavior in two cases: applications that
   are IPv4-only, and applications that are assuming that IPv4 is always
   available (i.e.  those incorrectly implementing RFC 6555 [RFC6555]
   and always using only IPv4 as the "fallback" connection, possibly
   even preferring it over IPv6.

   Especially problematic are the cases where the OS stack will return
   the list of addresses in the getaddrinfo() call sorted with IPv4 in
   the beginning, and the application would assume that the
   getaddrinfo() always returns IPv6 first.  While one can argue that
   the applications implementing "happy eyeballs" algorithms should not
   depend on the sort order of the entries, this behavior would break a
   lot of "legacy" applications that sequentially try the addresses
   returned by getaddrinfo().

   The "ARP for everything" rule causes an interface route to 0.0.0.0/0
   to be installed by the hosts, and IPv4 connection attempt will then
   take a very long time to time out, without any recourse to intervene
   from the network side - short of either replying on each ARP request
   and then spoofing the rejection of the connection by the remote host,
   or assigning bogus IPv4 addresses, with the default gateway rejecting
   all of the IPv4 traffic with ICMP Unreachable messages.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Description

   This proposal suggests to change the wording of the Section 2.6.2 of
   the Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses [RFC3927] to
   include the clarification: "If the host has any interface with a
   global unicast IPv6 address assigned and any IPv6 route to any non-
   connected network (including default), then the host MUST immediately
   return an error rather than transmit any packet with a link-local
   IPv4 source address unless the destination is also an IPv4 link-local
   address."

4.  Security Considerations

   The proposed behavior adjustment does create a potential for a DoS if
   the host uses IPv4 link-local only addressing, and the attacker
   forces IPv6 configuration by e.g.  sending a rogue RA.  The authors
   believe this scenario is a comparatively much more infrequent than
   the IPv6-only scenario - especially as the transition to IPv6
   progresses.  During the transition period the network administrators
   will have to secure both protocols, regardless of whether the
   addressing information is supplied by the network or not.

5.  Acknowledgements

   This document was born after a discussion at gogoNET LIVE!  3
   conference held November 12 - 14, 2012 at San Jose State University

6.  IANA Considerations

   None.
