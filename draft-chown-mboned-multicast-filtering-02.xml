Operators of multicast networks may apply various filters to multicast 
traffic at boundary routers or on MSDP peerings.  The aim of this text
is to discuss appropriate filtering policies, as well as documenting 
existing filtering practices, with a view to generating
some discussion towards producing guidance on best filtering practice.

<section title="Introduction">
	<t>
Multicast filtering can be applied at a multicast boundary or on
an MSDP peering as a means to prevent unintended leakage of multicast 
traffic beyond its desired scope.  An informal discussion of filtering
practices suggested that those practices vary from organisation
to organisation.  The aim of this text is to gather and document
commonly used existing filtering practices.  Whether it is then possible to
draw up a definitive best practice is to be determined; it is quite
possible that due to the shifting nature of the target that a point-in-time
recommendation would quickly be overtaken by events.  For example,
the recent addition of unicast prefix-based IPv4 multicast addresses
<xref target="RFC6034"/> meant that filtering of all of 234.0.0.0/8 became
undesirable. However, general principles may remain valid over time.
	</t>
	<t>
The text begins with a discussion of appropriate policies in Section 2,
followed by Section 3 in which we document a summary of reported practices
at border, organisational and subnet scopes. We then draw some conclusions
in Section 3.
	</t>
	<t>
For sites on academic research networks, some examples of filtering
recommendations already exists, e.g. in documentation 
<xref target="I2multicast"/> from the Internet2 Multicast WG, and in
the JANET IPv4 Multicast Guide <xref target="JANETmulticast"/>.
There is also a more specific proposal for the Rutgers network 
<xref target="RutgersProposal"/>, which includes a good discussion of
organisational-local scope address usage within its network as a whole.
	</t>
	<t>
When determining filtering policies, one needs to consider how strict
to be; some ranges are not supposed to be used, but there may be no
harm per se in accepting them.
There are certainly some ranges that should not be filtered, such
as the newly assigned 234.0.0.0/8 range mentioned above, and the
GLOP range under 233.0.0.0/8.
	</t>
	<t>
An additional resource is the registry of IPv4 multicast address space
held by IANA <xref target="IANAmulticast"/>.  This registry should be
a definitive guide to the formal use of ranges of addresses within
the overall IPv4 multicast address space.  A similar registry is
maintained for IPv6 multicast address space <xref target="IANA6multicast"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
This text is still quite an early draft, aimed at soliciting feedback, 
both on content and whether the goal of the draft is actually worthwhile.
Different sites may have different requirements.  There may also be
issues with handling scope boundaries that need to be considered.  So
there may be general principles that could be captured in a document 
such as this, even if specific filtering rules are not included.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="General Discussion of Policies">

	<t>
In this section we discuss how we might believe filters to be applied
with respect to various multicast protocol functions.  This may include
rate limiting and policing in addition to straight filtering.  
In the following
section we summarise  actual filtering practices that have been reported.
	</t>

<section title="Multicast Addressing and Domain Borders">

	<t>
To date, IPv4 multicast addresses have been assigned from the following 
ranges for global usage:
224.0/16, 224.1/16, 224.2/16, 224.3/16, 224.4/16, 232/8, 233/8 and 234/8.
All other IPv4 multicast addresses are therefore reserved, unassigned or 
scoped, and as such, have no legitimate reason for use on the Internet. 
Therefore we recommend operational filters that permit these address 
ranges and block all others at domain borders.
	</t>
	<t>
It should be noted that some networks do use multicast addresses outside 
of these ranges for internal purposes.  For example, 239/8, which is 
administratively scoped for Organization-Local usage, is functionally 
analogous to RFC 1918 unicast IPv4 addresses, and is often used by 
networks to support internal customers or infrastructure services.  
As such, these types of addresses may be used within a domain, but 
should never be allowed to cross domain borders.
	</t>

</section>

<section title="MSDP SA Policy and Policers">

	<t>
MSDP policies should include filters that allow SAs only from the assigned 
ASM IPv4 multicast address ranges: 224.0/16, 224.1/16, 224.2/16, 
224.3/16, 224.4/16, 233/8 and 234/8.  The 232/8 address range is reserved 
for SSM only, and thus, should never appear in MSDP.
	</t>
	<t>
The most common multicast attack vector that has appeared on the Internet 
has been MSDP SA storms.  In nearly all cases, these were triggered by 
Internet worms that probed large blocks of addresses in an attempt to 
scan vulnerable ports.  Typically, these worms were intended to scan 
only unicast addresses at random, however, the worm coders accidentally 
included multicast addresses in the random pools of destinations to scan. 
When port scans with destination addresses of multicast addresses occur 
on multicast-enabled network, these packets generate PIM register messages 
and, consequently, MSDP SA messages according to standard PIM and MSDP 
procedures, resulting in a flood of SA messages across the Internet that 
can put great strain on MSDP-speaking routers.
	</t>
	<t>
MSDP filters that allow SAs from only the assigned ranges do help to 
reduce the potential pool for these accidental attacks. However, the 
addition of MSDP policers provides much stronger protection from SA 
storms.  MSDP policers can be applied on a per-peer and per-source basis. 
Per-peer policers are used to detect when the number of SAs received from 
an MSDP peer exceeds a certain configured threshold.  These policers are 
functionally analogous to BGP max prefix limits applied on BGP peers, 
which alert an operator when the number of routes received from a BGP 
peer exceeds a certain configured threshold. Typically, this type of 
per-peer threshold is determined by observing the number of SAs that 
are normally advertised by a peer and then selecting some multiple of 
that to be a limit.  For example, if a peer normally advertises 2k SAs, 
an operator may set the per-peer threshold to 5k.
	</t>
	<t>
The challenge with per-peer limits is that they are not granular enough 
to determine good SAs from bad ones.  As such, these can actually lower 
the bar needed to launch a denial of service attack.  For example, 
with a 5k per-peer threshold, an attacker need only generate 5k SAs to 
trigger the limit and potentially block all the legitimate SAs from 
propagating.  As such, operators may want to use per-peer limits to 
trigger an alarm, rather than tear down the MSDP session.  Additionally, 
per-source MSDP policers can be used to provide further granularity between 
good and bad SAs.  Per-source SA policers define the maximum number 
of SAs that can be permitted from the same source (or source range).  
For example, an operator can use a per-source limit of 1k, which would 
prevent any source from generating more than 1k MSDP SAs.  With 
per-source limits in place, a heavily distributed attack would be 
necessary to generate enough MSDP state to impact routers as no single 
source can generate enough state.
	</t>

</section>

<section title="Multicast Scoping">

	<t>
Multicast scoping is used to block multicast packets based on group address.  Scoping filters should be used on all domain borders to allow only the assigned IPv4 multicast addresses (224.0/16, 224.1/16, 224.2/16, 224.3/16, 224.4/16, 232/8, 233/8 and 234/8) and block all other multicast groups from ingress/egress these borders.
	</t>

</section>

<section title="PIM Policy">

	<t>
While multicast scoping blocks traffic in the data plane, it does not 
affect the control plane.  Thus, an illegitimate group could be joined, 
with traffic carried across a providers network only to be dropped at 
the border by a scoping filter.  However, with PIM join filters, the 
join could be dropped at the border so that no state is created in the 
first place.  Therefore, PIM join filters can be used for additional 
protection on all domain borders to allow joins for only the assigned 
IPv4 multicast addresses (224.0/16, 224.1/16, 224.2/16, 224.3/16, 
224.4/16, 232/8, 233/8 and 234/8) and block joins for all other 
multicast groups. Additionally, PIM join filters can be used to block 
joins based on the source address of the multicast source (ie, the 
S in the (S,G) join).  So PIM join filters can also be configured to 
prevent joins for illegitimate interdomain sources, such as RFC 1918 
addresses.
	</t>
	<t>
PIM register filters can also be used to protect an RP from creating register 
state for illegitimate groups by allowing PIM registers on an RP for 
only the assigned IPv4 ASM multicast addresses (224.0/16, 224.1/16, 
224.2/16, 224.3/16, 224.4/16, 233/8 and 234/8) and blocking registers for 
all other multicast groups.  PIM register filters can also be configured 
to prevent registers for illegitimate interdomain sources, such as 
RFC 1918 addresses.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="IGMP Policy">

	<t>
As with PIM join filters, IGMP filters can be used for additional protection 
on all receiver LANs to allow IGMP reports for only the assigned IPv4 
multicast addresses (224.0/16, 224.1/16, 224.2/16, 224.3/16, 
224.4/16, 232/8, 233/8 and 234/8) and block reports for all other 
multicast groups.  IGMP filters can also be configured to prevent 
IGMPv3 source-included reports for illegitimate interdomain sources, such 
as RFC 1918 addresses.
	</t>

</section>

<section title="SAP">

	<t>
In the early years of multicast, routers were often configured to listen 
to the SAP group (224.2.127.254) and cache the SDP messages.  This 
was used as a quick and dirty way of determining if multicast was 
working properly.  Just by looking at the SAP/SDP cache on a router 
and guessing if the number of session entries looked about right, 
an operator could quickly determine if multicast flows were traversing 
the router.  However, this imprecise method of management and 
troubleshooting eventually proved dangerous, as improperly formatted SDP 
messages occasionally crashed routers as well as improperly 
configured SAP sources accidently transmitted the multicast stream 
they intended to announce on the SAP group, causing harm to routers 
that cached this data.  As such, routers should not be configured 
to listen to the SAP group and cache SDP messages.
	</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Summary of Reported Filtering Practices">

<section title="Border and MSDP Filtering">
	<t>
In this section we summarise IPv4 multicast addresses that are commonly
filtered at site borders or on MSDP peerings. Based on responses we
received from a couple of multicast community lists, it wasn't clear which
filters are applied on border routers and which on MSDP SA messages. 
Some sites apply minimal traffic filters, but heavier MSDP filtering.
	</t>
	<t>
A site may choose to filter on addresses or on observed TTLs; it is now
general practice to filter on addresses rather than the TTL filtering
that was common a long time ago.
	</t>
	<t>
Some sites choose to route multicast around their unicast firewalls, 
for performance or other operational reasons, but this shouldn't alter 
the requirement to filter groups appropriately where necessary.
	</t>
	<t>
In this section we draw on the small number contributions so far; we hope 
to get more inputs in time.  In general, many 224.0.0.* addresses that 
are used by infrastructure are typically blocked, as well as some addresses 
that are global scope but should not be, like Ghostcast.  
	</t>
	<t>
The following list includes multicast IPv4 addresses that are being filtered
based on the union of responses received so far (hence the apparent
duplication of certain prefixes).  The list of filters
applied by all respondents would be somewhat shorter.

	</t>
	<t>
One site gave figures for matches/hits on its filters; it may be 
interesting to gather such statistics at other sites.
	</t>
	<t>
Different networks make different use of the scoped address space
under 239.0.0.0/8, which may lead to different organisational filters
in different scenarios.  Organisation-local scope IPv4 multicast 
addressing is described in <xref target="RFC2365"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
The SSM range 232.0.0.0/8 should not be carried in MSDP peerings;
this is an example of different policy applied at the site border 
to an MSDP peering. Usually the filters are probably the same though.
	</t>
	<t>
As a general principle, multicast sourced from private address ranges
<xref target="RFC1918"/> or from 169.254.0.0/16, 192.0.2.0/24 or 
127.0.0.0/8 should be dropped, regardless of the multicast destination.
	</t>
	<t>
In certain cases, rate limiting may be desirable, where complete filtering
might not, e.g. in mitigating against SAP <xref target="RFC2974"/> storms,
or against unintended MSDP SA bursts.
	</t>
	<t>
Where BSR is deployed, a site should consider dropping BSR packets 
at its border, both BSR messages and C-RP messages.
Except for Embedded-RP it probably makes sense to drop PIM register 
messages at the site border, unless a site's RP is external.
	</t>
</section>

<section anchor="Org" title="Organisational filtering">
	<t>
As described in <xref target="RutgersProposal"/>, a site may use 
multiple organisational scopes within its site, which may use different
blocks from 239.0.0.0/8, and thus require appropriate filtering
at boundaries, e.g. between metropolitan campuses.
	</t>
</section>

<section anchor="Subnet" title="Subnet filtering">
	<t>
Two respondents are currently filtering uPNP between subnets, and one
is filtering mDNS. One reason for the uPNP filtering was due to issues 
with errant Ricoh printers which flood announcements with too-large TTLs.
	</t>
	<t>
Subnet filtering may help protect against other forms of misconfigured
client subnets.
One site has networks that consist of multiple edge routers, where the 
outside 'LAN side' is strictly meant to be for local subnets only, and 
all intranet comms are to go through the 'WAN interface'. They have had 
cases where multihomed client networks were misconfigured, cross-connecting 
IP subnets with layer 2 boxes.
To prevent multiplication of multicasts, they configure all edge routers 
in the intranet to accept multicast packets from the 'LAN side' only if 
the source IP of the multicast packets belongs to the IP subnet of that 
LAN. So it's a simple filter, with no scaling issues.
	</t>
	<t>
At least one site is filtering multicast traffic from its wireless links;
this is presumably streamed video or audio content.  Multicast support is
required on wireless links for IPv6 operation. At layer 2, multicast IPv6
Router Advertisements may be filtered on ports that do not have known
routers attached.
	</t>
	<t>
One site is running per-subnet boundary filters on its wired multicast-enabled
subnets.  The list below reflects these.  One could add local scope relative 
addresses, though in practice the latter would all fall under 239.255.0.0/16 
if it is the smallest scope group applied to a subnet.
