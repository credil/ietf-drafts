Abstract

   This document creates a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
   Option for transmitting a client's geolocation Uniform Resource 
   Identifier (URI). This Location URI can then be dereferenced in a 
   separate transaction by the client or sent to another entity and 
   dereferenced to learn physically where the client is located.

1.  Introduction

   This document creates a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
   Option for transmitting a client's geolocation Uniform Resource 
   Identifier (URI). The DHCP implementation of the client can then 
   make this location information available to upper layer protocols 
   for their usage.  This location URI points a Location Server 
   [RFC5808] which has the geolocation of the client (through means 
   not defined in this document).  In this scenario, the DHCP client 
   is a Geopriv Target (i.e., the entity whose geolocation is 
   associated with the location URI). 

   Applications using upper layer protocols within the Target can then 
   choose to deference this location URI and/or transmit the URI to 
   another entity as a means of conveying where the Target is located. 
   Dereferencing a location URI is described in [RFC6442]. Conveying 
   a location URI is also described in [RFC6442]. Session Initiation 
   Protocol (SIP) is not the only protocol that can dereference a 
   location URI; there is also HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) 
   [ID-HELD-DEREF] and HTTP [RFC2616].

   Having a location URI has advantages over having a PIDF-LO, 
   especially when a target's location changes.  With a location URI, 
   when a target moves, the location URI does not change (at least 
   within the same domain). It can still be given out as the reference 
   to the Target's current location. The opposite is true if the

Internet-Draft     Geopriv DHCP Location URI Option            Mar 2012

   location is conveyed by value in a message. Once the Target moves, 
   the previously given location is no longer valid, and if the Target 
   wants to inform another entity about its location, it has to send 
   the PIDF-LO to the location recipient (again). 

   A Location Server (LS) stores the Target's location as a presence 
   document, called a Presence Information Data Format - Location 
   Object (PIDF-LO), defined in RFC 4119 [RFC4119]. The Location Server
   is the entity contacted during the act of dereferencing a Target's 
   location.  If the dereferencing entity has permission, defined in 
   [ID-GEO-POL], the location of the target will be received.  The LS 
   will grant permission to location inquires based on the rules 
   established by a Rule Holder [RFC3693].  The LS has the ability to 
   challenge any request for a target's location, thereby providing 
   additive security properties before location revelation. 

   A problem exists within existing RFCs that provide location to the 
   UA ([RFC3825] and [RFC4776]). These DHCP Options for geolocation 
   values require an update of the entire location information (LI) 
   every time a client moves.  Not all clients will move frequently, 
   but some will.  Refreshing location values every time a client moves
   does not scale in certain networks/environments, such as IP-based 
   cellular networks, enterprise networks or service provider networks 
   with mobile endpoints.  An 802.11 based access network is one 
   example of this. Constantly updating LCI to endpoints might not 
   scale in mobile (residential or enterprise or municipal) networks in
   which the client is moving through more than one network attachment 
   point, perhaps as a person walks or drives with their client down a 
   neighborhood street or apartment complex or a shopping center or 
   through a municipality (that has IP connectivity as a service). 

   If the client was provided a location URI reference to retain and 
   hand out when it wants or needs to convey its location (in a 
   protocol other than DHCP), a location URI that would not change as 
   the client's location changes (within a domain), scaling issues 
   would be significantly reduced to needing an update of the location 
   URI only when a client changes administrative domains - which is 
   much less often.  This delivery of an indirect location has the 
   added benefit of not using up valuable or limited bandwidth to the 
   client with the constant updates.  It also relieves the client from 
   having to determine when it has moved far enough to consider asking 
   for a refresh of its location.  

   In enterprise networks, if a known location is assigned to each 
   individual Ethernet port in the network, a device that attaches to 
   the network a wall-jack (directly associated with a specific 
   Ethernet Switch port) will be associated with a known location via a
   unique circuit-ID that's used by the RAIO Option defined in RFC 3046
   [RFC3046].  This assumes wall-jacks have an updated wiremap 
   database.  RFC 3825 and RFC 4776 would return an LCI value of 
   location.  This document specifies how a location URI is returned 
   using DHCP.  The location URI points to a PIDF-LO contained on an 


Polk                    Expires Sept 10, 2012                  [Page 3]
Internet-Draft     Geopriv DHCP Location URI Option            Mar 2012

   LS. Performing a dereferencing transaction, that Target's PIDF-LO 
   will be returned.  If local configuration has the requirement of 
   only assigning unique location URIs to each client at the same 
   attachment point to the network (i.e., same RJ-45 jack or same 
   802.11 Access Point - except when triangulation is used), then 
   unique location URIs will be given out, though they will all have 
   the same location at the record, relieving the backend Sighter or LS
   from individually maintaining each location independently.

   This Option can be useful in IEEE 802.16e connected endpoints or IP 
   cellular endpoints.  The location URI Option can be configured on a 
   router, such as a residential home gateway, such that the router 
   receives this Location URI Option as a client with the ability to 
   communicate to downstream endpoints as a server.

   How an LS responds to a dereference request can vary, and a policy 
   established by a Ruleholder [RFC3693] for a Location Target as to 
   what type of challenge(s) is to be used, how strong a challenge is 
   used or how precise the location information is given to a 
   Location Recipient (LR). This document does not provide mechanisms 
   for the LS to tell the client about policies or for the client to 
   specify a policy for the LS. While an LS should apply an appropriate
   access-control policy, clients must assume that the LS will provide 
   location in response to any request (following the possession model
   [RFC5808]).  For further discussion of privacy, see the Security 
   Considerations.

   This document IANA-registers the new IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP Options for 
   a location URI.


2.  Format of the DHCP LocationURI Option


2.1 Overall Format of LocationURI Option in IPv4

   The LocationURI Option format for IPv4 is as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3

              counting the Code and Length bytes. This is a variable
              length Option, therefore the length value will change 
              based on the length of the URI within the Option.

   LocationURI: see Section 2.3 for details


2.2 Overall Format of LocationURI Option in IPv6

   The LocationURI Option format for IPv6 is as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3

2.3 LocationURI Format for both IPv4 and IPv6

   The LocationURI, in both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6, have the following 
   format:


     0                   1                   2                   3

                  LuriType field definition. The LuriLength itself is

Internet-Draft     Geopriv DHCP Location URI Option            Mar 2012

                  always a one-byte unsigned integer.

      LuriValue:  The LocationURI value, as described in detail below.
                  
   The LuriTypes this document defines for a point are:

      LuriType=1 Location URI - This field, in bytes, is the URI 
                 pointing at the location record where the PIDF-LO for 
                 the Location Target resides. The LuriValue of 
                 LuriType=1 is always represented in UTF-8.

      LuriType=2 Valid-For - The time, in seconds, this URI is to be 
                 considered Valid for dereferencing. The timer 
                 associated with this LuriType starts upon receipt of 
                 this Option by the client. The LuriValue of LuriType=2
                 is always represented as a four-byte unsigned integer.

   The Valid-For (LuriType=2) indicates how long, in seconds, the 
   client is to consider this location URI (LuriType=1) valid. The 
   choice of the Valid-For value is a policy decision for the operator 
   of the DHCP server.  Like location URIs themselves, it can be 
   statically configured on the DHCP server or provisioned dynamically 
   (via an out-of-band exchange with a Location Information Server) as 
   requests for location URIs are received.   

   The Valid-For time is used only at the application layer, as an 
   indication of when the URI can be used to access location.  It is 
   independent of the DHCP list time, and in no way related to the DHCP
   state machine.  Clients MUST NOT trigger an automatic DHCP refresh 
   on expiry of the Valid-For timer; rather, they should follow normal 
   DHCP mechanics.  

   The Valid-For (LuriType=2) offers no meaningful information without 
   an accompanying Location URI (LuriType=1), therefore a Valid-For 
   (LuriType=2) MUST NOT be sent without a Location URI (LuriType=1).

   The Valid-For (LuriType=2) is not mandated for use by this document.
   However, its presence MUST NOT cause any error in handling the 
   location URI (i.e., if not understood, it MUST be ignored).

   This Option format is highly extensible. Additional LuriType types 
   created MUST be done so through IANA registration with a standards 
   track RFC.


3. DHCP Option Operation

   The [RFC3046] RAIO can be utilized to provide the appropriate 
   indication to the DHCP Server where this DISCOVER or REQUEST message
   came from, in order to supply the correct response.  

   Caution SHOULD always be used involving the creation of large 


Polk                    Expires Sept 10, 2012                  [Page 6]
Internet-Draft     Geopriv DHCP Location URI Option            Mar 2012

   Options, meaning that this Option MAY need to be in its own INFORM, 
   OPTION or ACK message.

   It is RECOMMENDED to avoid building URIs, with any parameters, 
   larger than what a single DHCP response can be.  However, if a 
   message is larger than 255 bytes, concatenation is allowed, per RFC 
   3396 [RFC3396].

   Per [RFC2131], subsequent LocationURI Options, which are 
   non-concatenated, overwrite the previous value.

   Location URIs MUST NOT reveal identity information of the user of 
   the device, since DHCP is a cleartext delivery protocol. For 
   example, creating a location URI such as

      sips:34LKJH534663J54@example.com 

   is better than a location URI such as

      sips:aliceisat123mainstalantageorgiaus@example.com

   The username portion of the first example URI provides no direct 
   identity information (in which 34LKJH534663J54 is considered to be a
   random number in this example).

   In the <presence> element of a PIDF-LO document, there is an 
   'entity' attribute that identities what entity *this* document 
   (including the associated location) refers to.  It is up to the 
   PIDF-LO generator, either Location Server or an application in the 
   endpoint, to insert the identity in the 'entity' attribute.  This 
   can be seen in [RFC4119].  The considerations for populating the 
   entity attribute value in a PIDF-LO document are independent from 
   the considerations for avoiding exposing identification information 
   in the username part of a location URI.


   This Option is used only for communications between a DHCP client 
   and a DHCP server.  It can be solicited (requested) by the client, 
   or it can be pushed by the server without a request for it.  DHCP 
   Options not understood MUST be ignored [RFC2131].  A DHCP server 
   supporting this Option might or might not have the location of a 
   client.  If a server does not have a client's location, but needs to
   provide this Location URI Option to a client (for whatever reason), 
   an LS is contacted.  This server-to-LS transaction is not DHCP, 
   therefore it is out of scope of this document. Note that this 
   server-to-LS transaction could delay the DHCP messaging to the 
   client. If the server fails to have location before it transmits its
   message to the client, location will not be part of that DHCP 
   message. Any timers involved here are a matter of local 
   configuration.

   The deference of a target's location URI would not involve DHCP, but

Internet-Draft     Geopriv DHCP Location URI Option            Mar 2012

   an application layer protocol, such as SIP or HTTP, therefore 
   dereferencing is out of scope of this document. 

   In the case of residential gateways being DHCP servers, they usually
   perform as DHCP clients in a hierarchical fashion up into a service 
   provider's network DHCP server(s), or learn what information to 
   provide via DHCP to residential clients through a protocol, such as 
   PPP.  In these cases, the location URI would likely indicate the 
   residence's civic address to all wired or wireless clients within 
   that residence.  


3.1 Architectural Assumptions

   The following assumptions have been made for use of this LocationURI
   Option for a client to learn its location URI (in no particular 
   order):

   o  Any user control (what [RFC3693] calls a 'Ruleholder') for access
      to the dereferencing step is assumed to be out of scope of this 
      document. An example authorization policy is in [ID-GEO-POL].

   o  The authorization vs. possession security model can be found in 
      [RFC5808], describing what is expected in each model of 
      operation.  It should be assumed that a location URI attained 
      using DHCP will operate under an possession model by default. 
      An authorization model can be instituted as a matter of local 
      policy.  An authorization model means possessing the location URI
      does not give that entity the right to view the PIDF-LO of the 
      target whose location is indicated in a presence document.  The 
      dereference transaction will be challenged by the Location Server
      only in an authorization model.  The nature of this challenge is 
      out of scope of this document.  

   o  This document does not prevent some environments from operating 
      in an authorization model, for example - in less tightly 
      controlled networks. The costs associated with authorization vs. 
      possession models are discussed in Section 3.3.2 of [RFC5606].


3.2 Harmful URIs and URLs

   There are, in fact, some types of URIs that are not good to receive,
   due to security concerns.  For example, any URLs that can have 
   scripts, such as "data:" URLs, and some "HTTP:" URLs that go to web 
   pages that have scripts.  Therefore,

   o URIs received via this Option MUST NOT be automatically sent to a 
     general-browser to connect to a web page, because they could have 
     harmful scripts.

   o This Option MUST NOT contain "data:" URLs, because they could

     contain harmful scripts.

   Instead of listing all the types of URIs and URLs that can be 
   misused or potentially have harmful affects, Section 3.3 IANA 
   registers acceptable location URI schemes (or types).

   URI scheme (or type) for this DHCP Option:

   URIs using the "pres" scheme are dereferenced using the presence 
   event package for SIP [RFC3856], so they will reference a PIDF-LO 
   document when location is available.  Responses to requests for URIs
   with other schemes ("sip", "sips", "http", and "https") MUST have 
   MIME type 'application/pidf+xml'.  Alternatively, HTTP and HTTPS 
   URIs MAY refer to information with MIME type 'application/held+xml',
   in order to support HELD dereferencing [ID-HELD-DEREF].  Clients can
   indicate which MIME types they support using the "Accept" header 
   field in SIP [RFC3261] or HTTP [RFC2616].

   See RFC 3922 [RFC3922] for using the pres: URI with XMPP.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers follow Section 4.6 of RFC 6442 
   [RFC6442] as guidance regarding which Location URI schemes to 
   provide in DHCP. That document discusses what a receiving entity 
   does when receiving a URI scheme that is not understood. Awareness 
   to the two URI types there is important for conveying location, if 
   SIP is used to convey a Location URI provided by DHCP.


4.  IANA Considerations

4.1 The IPv4 Option number for this Option

   This document IANA registers this IPv4 Option number XXX (to be 
   assigned by IANA once this document becomes an RFC).


4.2 The IPv6 Option-Code for this Option

   This document IANA registers this IPv6 Option-Code XXX (to be 
   assigned by IANA once this document becomes an RFC).

4.3 IANA Considerations for LuriTypes 

   IANA is requested to create a new registry for acceptable location 
   types defined in Section 3.2 of this document, arranged similar to 
   this:

   +------------+----------------------------------------+-----------+
   |  LuriType  |   Name                                 | Reference |
   +------------+----------------------------------------+-----------+
   |     1      |   Location URI                         | RFC XXXX* |
   |     2      |   Valid-For                            | RFC XXXX* |
   +------------+----------------------------------------+-----------+
    
    * RFC XXXX is to be replaced with this document's RFC-Editor RFC 
      number.

   Additions to this registry require a standards track RFC.


5.  Security Considerations

   Where critical decisions might be based on the value of this 
   location URI option, DHCP authentication in [RFC3118] SHOULD be used
   to protect the integrity of the DHCP options.  

   A real concern with RFC 3118 it is that not widely deployed because 
   it requires pre-shared keys to successfully work (i.e., in the
   client and in the server).  Most implementations do not 
   accommodate this.

   DHCP, initially, is a broadcast request (a client looking for a 
   server), and a unicast response (answer from a server) type of 
   protocol.  It does not provide security at the network layer.  
   Instead, it relies on lower-layer security mechanisms.  

   Once a client has a URI, it needs information on how the location 
   server will control access to dereference requests.  A client might 
   treat a tightly access-controlled URI differently from one that can 
   be dereferenced by anyone on the Internet (i.e., one following the 
   "possession model").  With the LuriTypes defined in this document, 
   the DHCP option for delivering location URIs can only tell the user 
   how long the URI will be valid.  Since the client does not know what
   policy will be applied during this validity interval, clients MUST 
   handle location URIs as if they could be dereferenced by anybody 
   until they expire.  For example, such open location URIs should only
   be transmitted in encrypted channels.  Nonetheless, location servers
   SHOULD apply appropriate access control policies, for example by 
   limiting the number of queries that any given client can make, or 
   limiting access to users within an enterprise.  

   Extensions to this option, such as [ID-POLICY-URI] can provide 
   mechanisms for accessing and provisioning policy.  Giving users

Internet-Draft     Geopriv DHCP Location URI Option            Mar 2012

   access to policy information will allow them to make more informed 
   decisions about how to use their location URIs.  Allowing users to 
   provide policy information to the LS will enable them to tailor 
   access control policies to their needs (within the bounds of policy 
   that the LS will accept).

   As to the concerns about the location URI itself, as stated in the 
   document (see Section 3), it MUST NOT have any user identifying 
   information in the URI user-part/string itself.  The location URI 
   also needs to be hard to guess that it belongs to a specific user.  

   When implementing a DHCP server that will serve clients across an 
   uncontrolled network, one should consider the potential security 
   risks therein.
