      <t>This document describes how to use PCP to retrieve the identify of a
      host behind a NAT. Two use cases are discussed and the PCP applicability
      is analyzed. This document extends PCP with a new OpCode: QUERY.</t>

      <t>The proposed mechanism is valid for all NAT flavors including NAT44,
      NAT64 or NPTv6. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>As reported in <xref target="RFC6269"></xref>, several issues are
      encountered when an IP address is shared among several subscribers.
      These issues are encountered in various deployment contexts: e.g.,
      Carrier Grade NAT (CGN), application proxies or A+P <xref
      target="RFC6346"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document extends <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base">Port Control
      Protocol</xref> to identify a host among those sharing the same IP
      address in certain scenarios.</t>

      <t>The proposed technique can be used independently or combined with the
      host identifier, denoted as HOST_ID defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The main issue in this case is that PCEF, PCRF and AF all receive
        information bound to the same UE but cannot correlate between the
        piece of data visible for each entity. Concretely,</t>

            <t>PCEF is aware of the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber

            <t>PCRF is not able to correlate between the external IP
            address/port assigned by the NAT and the internal IP address and
            IMSI of the UE. For instance, the offered QoS on internal IPv4
            address and the (shared) external IPv4 address may need to be
            correlated for accounting purposes.</t>

            <t>The IP address seen by the AF is shared among multiple UEs
            using NAT, the PCRF needs to be able to inspect the NAT binding to
            disambiguate among the individual UEs. AF will not be able to
            treat UE traffic based on policy provided by PCRF.</t>

        PCEF and AF are only aware of the external IP address and the external
        port number assigned by the NAT function. PCEF/AF will fail to
        identify each UE behind NAT since multiple UEs share the same external

        <t>A solution to solve the problem discussed in <xref
        target="pb1"></xref> is to enable a PCP Server to control the NAT and
        enable a PCP Client in the PCRF. The updated interaction between PCRF,
        PCEF and AF is detailed below.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The PCP server controlling the NAT is configured to accept PCP
            requests with THIRD_PARTY Option from authorized PCP clients
            (i.e., PCRF).</t>

            <t>PCRF is configured with the IP address of the PCP Server.</t>

            <t>The PCRF is aware of the following 5-tuple of each flow
            {Internal IP address of UE, Internal Port, Protocol, Remote Peer
            IP address, Remote Port number} learnt from PCEF. PCRF is also
            aware of the following 5-tuple of each flow {External IP address,
            External Port, Protocol, Remote Peer IP address, Remote Port
            number} learnt from AF.</t>

            <t>The PCRF generates PCP PEER request with THIRD_PARTY option
            which has Internal IP Address set to the UE's Internal IP address
            provided by the PCEF. <list style="symbols">
                <t>The Internal Port, Protocol, Remote Peer Port, Remote Peer
                IP Address fields of the PEER request are set by the PCRF
                according to the 5-tuple flow information provided by
                PCEF.</t>

                <t>Suggested External Port and Suggested External IP Address

              </list></t>

            <t>Upon the receipt of the PEER response, the PCRF compares the
            External IP Address and Port learnt with the 5-tuple flow
            information provided by the AF to correlate external IP
            address/port associated with the mapping and the internal IP
            address/port of the flow. </t>

            <t>PCRF notifies PCEF/AF to enforce relevant policies for the
            UE.</t>

        <t>A solution to solve the problem discussed in <xref

            Internet-facing interface but from an internal interface (e.g.,
            dedicated management interface).</t>

            <t>PCRF generates a PCP QUERY request with External IP Address,
            External Port, Remote Peer IP address, Remote Peer Port and

            <t>PCRF learns the internal IP address and internal port number in
            the QUERY response. This correlation is used by the PCRF to

          </list><xref target="figure5"></xref> shows an example of the use of

        UA (192.0.2.1:33041) to an HTTP server (198.51.100.2:80). The NAT
        assigns 198.51.100.1/23432 as external IP Address/Port. PCRF learns
        Internal IP Address and Port associated with the NAT mapping using PCP
        QUERY request/response.</t>

      <section title="Generating a QUERY Request">
        <t>This section describes the operation of a PCP client when sending
        requests with the QUERY OpCode.</t>

        <t>PCP QUERY request is used by an authorized third party PCP client
        that is only aware of the 5-tuple {External IP address and Port,
        Protocol, Remote Peer IP address and Port} and needs to learn the
        Internal IP address and Port associated with the NAT mapping. The
        request MUST contain non-zero values of Protocol, External Port,
        Remote Peer Port, External IP address and Remote Peer IP address. The
        Requested Lifetime MUST be set to zero.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Processing a QUERY Request">
        <t>This section describes the operation of a PCP server when
        processing a QUERY request.</t>

        <t>For EIM/EIF port-mapping NAT, the processing of the QUERY request
        is as follows:<list style="symbols">
            <t>If any of the values Protocol, External Port and External IP
            address are equal to zero, the request is invalid and the PCP
            server MUST return a MALFORMED_REQUEST to the client.</t>

            <t>If Protocol, External Port and External IP address do not match
            any existing implicit dynamic mapping, then the PCP server MUST
            return NONEXIST_MAP error response (also needed in <xref
            target="I-D.boucadair-pcp-failure"></xref>).</t>

            <t>If Protocol, External Port and External IP address match an
            existing implicit dynamic mapping, then the PCP server MUST build
            a QUERY response with the Internal IP address, Internal Port and
            the lifetime associated with the mapping.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>For EDM port-mapping NAT, the processing of the QUERY request is as
        follows:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>If any of the values Protocol, External Port, Remote Peer Port,
            External IP address and Remote Peer IP Address are zero, the
            request is invalid and PCP server MUST return a MALFORMED_REQUEST
            to the client.</t>

            <t>If Protocol, External Port, Remote Peer Port, External IP
            address and Remote Peer IP address do not match any existing
            implicit dynamic mapping then the PCP server MUST return
            NONEXIST_MAP error response (also needed in <xref
            target="I-D.boucadair-pcp-failure"></xref>).</t>

            <t>If Protocol, External Port, Remote Peer Port, External IP
            address and Remote Peer IP address matches an existing implicit
            dynamic mapping then the PCP server builds a QUERY response with
            the Internal IP address, Internal Port and the lifetime associated
            with the mapping.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>PCP QUERY requests received on the Internet-facing interface MUST
        be silently drooped. </t>

        <t>In DS-Lite context <xref target="RFC6333"></xref>, the Internal IP
        address returned in the QUERY response MUST be the IPv6 address of the
        remote tunnel endpoint and not the internal private IPv4 address.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Processing a QUERY Response">
        <t>After performing common PCP response processing by the PCP Client,
        the response is further matched with a previously-sent QUERY request
        by comparing the QUERY Nonce, External IP Address, External Port and
        Protocol. On a SUCCESS response, the PCP Client can use the Internal
        IP Address and Port in the QUERY response as needed.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Applicability Scope of QUERY OpCode">
      <t>The PCP-Reveal solution is designed for needs within one single
      administrative domain (i.e., the PCP Client and PCP Server are managed
      by the same entity). Considerations related to the activation of the
      PCP-Reveal solution in an inter-domain context is out of scope of this
      document.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>Authors of this document request the following OpCode:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>QUERY</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The following error code is requested:<list style="symbols">
          <t>NONEXIST_MAP</t>
        </list></t>

      <t></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Security considerations discussed in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref> are to be taken into account. In
      particular, QUERY OpCode MUST NOT be implemented or used unless the
      network on which the PCP QUERY messages are to be sent is fully trusted.
      For example if Access Control Lists (ACLs) are installed on the PCP
      server, and the network between the PCP client and the PCP server, so
      those ACLs allow only communications from a trusted PCP client to the
      PCP server. </t>

      <t>QUERY OpCode may be generated by non legitimate PCP Clients; the PCP
      Server MUST enforce some policies such as rate limit QUERY messages.
      QUERY requests received from non legitimate PCP Clients are silently
      dropped.</t>

      <t>PCP authentication <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcp-authentication"></xref>
      MAY be used.</t>
