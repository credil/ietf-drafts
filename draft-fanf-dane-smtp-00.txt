      Secure inter-domain SMTP with TLS, DNSSEC and TLSA records.
                        draft-fanf-dane-smtp-00

Abstract

   SMTP supports STARTTLS for inter-domain mail transfer, but it only
   provides very limited security because the server's certificate
   cannot be authenticated.  This memo specifies how TLSA records in the
   DNS can be used for proper MX target server authentication.

Internet-Draft               SMTP with TLSA                     May 2012


1.  Introduction

   The specification for SMTP over TLS [RFC3207] does not describe how
   to authenticate a server: which identity relating to the connection
   ought to be authenticated by the server's certificate.  In practice,
   most certificates presented by publicly-referenced SMTP servers
   either cannot be validated with respect to a well-known certification
   authority, or do not verify any identity expected by the client.

   As a result, inter-domain SMTP clients cannot require working server
   authentication if they want to successfully send mail using TLS.
   Therefore TLS currently provides only a limited amount of additional
   security for inter-domain SMTP.  Its encryption protects against on-
   path passive eavesdropping; but it does not protect against an active
   attack, since the client has no way to detect when an attacker is
   spoofing the server.

   This memo describes how to fix this using DNSSEC [RFC4033] and TLSA
   records [I-D.ietf-dane-protocol].

   We use DNSSEC to secure the association between a mail domain and its
   SMTP server host names.  A server's TLS certificate authenticates its
   host name.

   As well as its normal function of providing an association between a
   domain name and a certificate, we are using the existance of a TLSA
   record to signal to the client that it can expect a valid server
   certificate.

   The protocol described in this memo adds new security checks that can
   cause email delivery to be delayed when a security failure is
   detected.


2.  Terminology

   ADMD:  An ADministrative Management Domain, as described in the
      Internet Mail Architecture [RFC5598].

   SMTP server host name:  The target of a (possibly implicit) MX
      record.

   Inter-domain SMTP:  SMTP between different ADMDs across the public
      Internet, where a client sends mail to a publicly-referenced SMTP
      server.

   Mail domain:  The part of an email address after the "@"; also the
      owner name of a (possibly implicit) MX record.

   MX resolution:  The algorithm for resolving a mail domain into a set
      of SMTP server hosts, described in [RFC5321] section 5.

   Publicly-referenced SMTP server:  An SMTP server which runs on port
      25 of an Internet host located using MX resolution.  (This term is
      from [RFC3207].)

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   memo are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Details of SMTP with TLSA

   In the following we describe some additions to the usual MX
   resolution algorithm described in [RFC5321] section 5.  If there is
   any conflict between [RFC5321] and this memo, that is an error in
   this memo.

   The client SHALL look up the MX RRset for the mail domain.  There are
   three succesful results that yield a list of SMTP server host names:

   o  A list of one or more MX records;

   o  An implicit MX record, in lieu of an empty list of MX records;

   o  A CNAME to a successful result.

   If the lookup is not successful, the client SHALL proceed as usual.

   All of these DNS RRsets MUST be "secure" according to DNSSEC
   validation ([RFC4033] section 5).  In the case of an implicit MX
   record, there MUST be a secure denial of existence of an MX RRset for
   the mail domain.  In the case of a (chain of) CNAME RRs, all the
   CNAMEs MUST be secure as well as their ultimate target.

   If any of the responses is "bogus", the client MUST treat this as a
   temporary error.

   If these security requirements are not satisfied, this protocol does
   not take effect.  The client SHOULD fall back to insecure delivery
   (which might be over unauthenticated TLS).

   The client now has an authentic list of SMTP server host names and
   priority values.  It processes this list as usual.

   The rest of this section applies to each SMTP server host name
   individually.

   When connecting to a server, the client SHALL look up its TLSA RRset
   as described in [I-D.ietf-dane-protocol] section 3.  That is, the
   TLSA RRset owner name SHALL be "_25._tcp.hostname" where "hostname"
   is the SMTP server host name.  The response can be one of the
   following (as listed in [I-D.ietf-dane-protocol] section 4.1):

   o  A secure answer containing one or more TLSA records, in which case
      the client SHALL proceed as descrbed below.

   o  A bogus answer, which the client SHALL treat as a temporary error.

   o  In the other cases the client SHOULD deliver to this server
      insecurely (which might be over unauthenticated TLS).

   The client now has one or more TLSA records for the server it is
   connecting to.

   The client MUST ensure that the server offers the STARTTLS service
   extension [RFC3207] in its response to the client's EHLO command
   ([RFC5321] section 4.1.1.1).

   The client SHALL then issue the STARTTLS command which MUST be
   successful.  It then proceeds with TLS negotiation.

   The client SHALL validate the server's certificate as described in
   [I-D.ietf-dane-protocol] section 2.1.

   The client SHALL verify the server's identity as described in
   [RFC6125] section 6.  Its list of reference identifiers MUST include
   the SMTP server host name with type DNS-ID, and MAY include a second
   copy of the host name with type CN-ID.

   If any of these checks fail, the client MUST disconnect from the
   server and treat this as a temporary failure.

   The client can now proceed to deliver mail securely.

   The client MAY wish to insert a header at the start of the message to
   record the fact that it authenticated the server.  XXX: Perhaps the
   form of this header should be specified here.


4.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA action is required.

5.  Security considerations

   This memo provides only conditional security.  It allows a server to
   publish in the DNS the details of how it can be authenticated.
   Clients that implement this protocol can use it to provide a strong
   guarantee that they are sending mail to the correct place.

   There is no way for a server to tell if a client has authenticated it
   using this protocol, since SMTP has no mechanism to signal this
   information.

   We do not specify that clients check that all of a mail domain's SMTP
   server host names consistently have or do not have TLSA records.
   This is so that partial or incremental deployment does not break mail
   delivery.  Inconsistencies are likely if a domain has a third-party
   backup MX, for example.

   We do not specify that clients check the DNSSEC state of the SMTP
   server address records.  This is not necessary since the certificate
   checks ensure that the client has connected to the correct server.
   (The address records will normally have the same security state as
   the TLSA records, but they can differ if there are CNAME or DNAME
   indirections.)

   This memo does not make any changes to SMTP client authentication.
   Inter-domain SMTP client authentication remains extremely weak.

Appendix A.  Rationale - choice of certificate identity

   There are a number of reasons for the certificate to authenticate the
   SMTP server host name rather than the mail domain.

   SMTP allows a client to transfer mail to recipients at multiple
   domains in the same connection.  If the certificate identifies the
   host name then it does not need to list all the possible mail
   domains.

   It is not in general feasible for the server to select a mail domain
   certificate based on the recipient domains when the connection is
   established (using Server Name Indication, [RFC6066] section 3),
   because an SMTP client might not know all of the recipients when it
   establishes the connection.

   Outgoing SMTP relays and message submission servers handle mail for
   any domain, so in those cases the only sensible option is for the
   certificate to contain the host name.  It is more consistent for
   incoming MX server certificates to match.

   It is common for SMTP servers to act in multiple roles, as outgoing
   relays or as incoming MX servers, depending on the client identity.
   It is simpler if the server can present the same certificate
   regardless of the role in which it is to act.

   Sometimes the server does not know its role until the client has
   authenticated, which usually occurs after TLS has been established.
