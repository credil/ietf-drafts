   Parameter Provisioning with non-DHCP-PD in Carrier-side Stateless
                                Solution

Abstract

   The deployment of carrier-side stateless solution requires some
   particular considerations in mobile network contexts.  The widely
   existed legacy network restricts the development of IP address
   provisioning based on DHCP-PD.  The memo provided several potential
   approaches to facilitate the issues and provide the possibilities
   leveraging 3GPP mechanism.  The stateless algorithm is required to be
   updated depending to the preferred solution accordingly.

1.  Introduction

   The work item of carrier-side stateless has been chartered and
   motivation has been described in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation].  Several candidates
   solutions have been designed to meet the demands, such as
   4rd[I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] and MAP-E, MAP-T[I-D.ietf-softwire-map].
   Regarding the configuration rule provisioning, a particular DHCPv6
   option have been proposed to assign mapping rules to CE nodes.
   Mapping rules may serve to derive IPv4 address depending on delegated
   CE IPv6 prefix.  Since the potential dependency between IPv4 and IPv6
   is existing, CE IPv6 prefix inserted with EA-bits is presumably
   delegated using DHCP-PD[RFC3633].

   IPv6 prefix delegation is a feature of 3GPP Release-10 and is not
   covered by any earlier releases[RFC6459].  In another words, when the
   case is coming down to a mobile network contexts, those provisioning
   should require 3GPP Release 10 or beyond network, which is not
   deployed anywhere today.  Some implementations may consider the lack
   of the functionalities to use static configuration on mobile
   terminals, but such solution is not scale well, especially facing
   several million of customers.  Therefore, the absence of DHCP-PD may
   become a push-back during the deployment in 3GPP network.

   This document proposed a number of alternative solutions to the
   problem, such that the softwires wg can discuss both of them.  It is
   expected that once the softwires wg converges on a preferred
   solution, the other ones will be removed from the document.


2.  Possible Solutions

2.1.  Design Principles

   In earlier Release 3GPP network, only the /64 prefix could be
   allocated for each user via SLAAC[RFC4862].  Statelss DHCPv6[RFC3736]
   is available in those network, but stateful DHCPv6[RFC3315] is not
   supported.  The following solutions is trying to leverage current
   mobile network.  Considering operational approaches to resolve the
   problems, the document avoid introduce additional protocol changes to
   existing devices in network sides.  The potential changes on UE sides
   could be easily implemented using user-land codes.  A address block
   could be reserved from addressing plan corresponding to Rule IPv6
   prefix.  Such CE-specific IPv6 prefix can't be delivered through
   DHCP-PD, but could be achieved through following approaches.

2.2.  Using IID to carry EA-bits

   Without IPv6 prefix delegation, network could not assign a prefix
   shorter than /64.  Therefore, a IPv6 prefix with EA-bits might be
   nowhere to get.  One possible approach is to change current port
   algorithm a bit to get EA-bits from interface identifier (IID),
   because 3GPP network would assign a IID to user before a global IPv6
   address is delivered.  Referring to Section 9.2.1.1 in 3GPP
   [TS23.060], IPv6 address allocation is experiencing two phases.
   Mobile Gateway shall provide an interface identifier to the user in
   advance to ensure that the link-local address generated by the user
   does not collide with the link-local address of the mobile gateway.
   Mobile gateway could deliver such IID so as to carry EA-bits.  When
   mapping rule has delivered to CE at second phase, CE nodes could
   derive the EA-bits by shifting with length of u-bits and digging the
   bits with EA length.

   CE could synthesize a CE IPv6 prefix and address according the
   algorithm respectively.  The translation could be performed
   afterwards with such CE-generated IPv6 address.  Since the system
   already reserve an address block, there is no address collision risks
   when transmitting the packages.

   The pros of the approach is this mechanism doesn't require any
   changes to 3GPP network.  The cons is that requires updates on
   current algorithm.  Distinguishing DHCP-PD and non-PD case is needed
   to perform EA-bits generation.

2.3.  Changing ND behaviour to deliver IPv6 prefix

   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), as specified in
   [RFC4861] and [RFC4862], is widely available in earlier 3GPP network.
   Since a IPv6 block have been reserved for CE prefix, this block can
   be treated as on-line for specific user.  Referring to Section
   9.2.1.1 in 3GPP [TS23.060], UE may send router solicitation message
   to the mobile gateway on point-to-point link at second phase.  Normal
   process of gateway is to assign a router advertisement message
   containing /64 prefix heading to UE with A bit set in Prefix
   Information option.  In order to delivery the CE prefix through ND,
   the gateway should response RA with prefix information option
   including reserved CE prefix, length of which is usually shorter than
   /64.  The configuration of this prefix option should set O bit and
   unset A bit.

   CE receiving the option could set the prefix as CE IPv6 prefix.  The
   process of algorithm can be remained as-is.

   The pros of the approach is to keep current algorithm with no

   changes.  The cons for that is to increase the provisioning
   complexity on mobile gateway.

2.4.  Combination of DHCPv4v6 Approach

   3GPP network can't support the stateful DHCPv6[RFC3315] process.  Any
   process related to stateful would be failed in 3GPP network.
   Therefore, the provisioning of mapping rules through DHCPv6 would be
   restricted to stateless parameters provisioning, like rule IPv4
   prefix and rule IPv6 prefix.  Dynamic information should be retrieved
   through another way. 3GPP network could support DHCPv4[RFC2131] by
   indicating to the network within PDP(Packet Data Protocol) activation
   protocol negotiations.  That provides a possibility to carry port-
   restricted information from DHCPv4 options.  In such consideration,
   port delegation with port mask allocation in
   [I-D.bajko-pripaddrassign]can be combined with stateless
   DHCPv6[RFC3736] to populate CE with complete mapping rules.

   CE could synthesize a CE IPv6 prefix and address according the
   algorithm respectively, because CE already received sufficient
   information to generate IPv6 prefix automatically.  The translation
   could be performed afterwards with such CE-generated IPv6 address.
   Since the system already reserve the address block, there is no
   duplicated risks when transmitting the packages.

   The combination of DHCPv4v6 would leverage 3GPP process and doesn't
   require any change to existing 3GPP system.  The cons for this
   approach would potentially cause doubling PDP counts for earlier
   release terminals before Release 8.  The algorithm should also be
   needed to update accordingly.


3.  Conclusions

   Three aforementioned solutions have been proposed to address issues
   of non-DHCP-PD provisioning in mobile contexts.  It required WG to
   evaluate the solutions and determine the workaround for the issues.
   The minimal impacts to 3GPP system are desirable for the preferable
   solution.
