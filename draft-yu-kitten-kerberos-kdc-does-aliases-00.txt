Internet-Draft          KDC-resolves-aliases flag               Feb 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a new Kerberos Ticket flag that indicates
   that the Key Distribution Center (KDC) is capable of resolving
   hostname aliases.  A Kerberos client can interpret the presence of
   this Ticket flag as a recommendation to avoid using potentially
   insecure DNS lookups to canonicalize hostnames when constructing
   Kerberos principal names.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Motivation

   When attempting to authenticate to a Kerberos application service,
   existing Kerberos client implementations typically perform hostname
   canonicalization when constructing the Kerberos service principal.
   In practice, these clients canonicalize using insecure DNS, contrary
   to the recommendations in RFC 4120 [RFC4120].  Implementations are
   not consistent about whether they use forward resolution (looking up
   an address record for the user-provided hostname and returning the
   accompanying canonical hostname) or reverse resolution (taking the IP
   address from a forward resolution and returning the reverse pointer
   (PTR) record) to canonicalize hostname components of Kerberos service
   principal names.


4.  KDC Behavior

   If a KDC has knowledge of all hostname aliases for host-based service
   principal names in its realm, it SHOULD set the kdc-resolves-aliases
   (number TBD) flag in the Ticket and EncKDCRepPart for all tickets it
   issues.


5.  Client Behavior

   If a client receives an EncKDCRepPart that has the flag kdc-resolves-
   aliases set, it SHOULD NOT attempt to canonicalize hostnames in
   service principal names for the realm whose KDC set that flag.
   Instead, the client SHOULD use the unchanged user-provided hostname
   when constructing the service principal name.  The following
   behaviors in RFC 4120 [RFC4120] are still permitted: clients MAY

   append a statically configured domain name to unqualified hostname,
   and clients SHOULD fold the hostname to lowercase.


6.  Assigned numbers

   TBD


7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.


8.  Security Considerations

   The new ticket flag described in this document allows Kerberos realm
   administrators to communicate a recommendation to clients that they
   not attempt any hostname canonicalization when constructing service
   principal names.  This avoids the use of insecure DNS to resolve
   hostnames, which can allow principal name substitution attacks in
   some environments.

   suggested this idea and contributed to its evolution.
