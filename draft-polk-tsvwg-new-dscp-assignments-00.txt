1.  Introduction

   This document requests five new Differentiated Services Code Point 
   (DSCP) values (DSCP) from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority 
   (IANA) for new classes of rich media traffic and one additional DSCP
   value for the signaling of multimedia sessions. Four of the six new 
   DSCP values are for traffic classes that are admitted by the network
   using an additional Capacity-Admission signaling procedure to the 
   normal signaling that occurs between multiple endpoints establishing
   a traffic flow between endpoints.  The additional capacity-admission
   signaling procedure is offered in RFC 5865 [RFC5865], which defined 
   the Voice-Admit per hop behavior (PHB) DSCP. Each of these four 
   traffic classes can conform to the Expedited Forwarding Per-Hop 
   Behavior, if configured to do so, using the Priority Queuing system 
   such as that defined in Section 1.4.1.1 of [ID-4594-UP].  

   It is expected that voice and video media samples will be carried 
   using the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550], thus making 
   voice by itself indistinguishable from video to routers and 
   switches, unless one of two things occurs:  

   o  Deep packet inspection (DPI) at the ingress of each DiffServ edge 
      node to determine that the packet is an RTP packet with a certain 
      codec that properly identifies it as either a voice or video 
      packet, or

   o  have a separate marking for the packets (i.e., a different DSCP).

   It is certainly the case that voice samples/frames can be in the 
   same packet as video frames, thus making the packet marked either 
   voice or video, but that will have to be left to the application to 
   decide if that is a good idea. For what it is worth, most current 
   implementations of mixing the media types have the packets marked as
   a video.

Internet-Draft        New Rich Media (Video) DSCPs             Mar 2012

   This effort is based on the work started in RFC 5865 [RFC5865], a 
   Differentiated Services Code Point for Capacity-Admitted Traffic 
   voice only traffic, which recommends the classes created within RFC 
   4594 [RFC4594] be extended for video traffic flows of different 
   types. Nearly all of what is requested and referenced here is based 
   on what started in RFC 4594, but with video as the dominant 
   application as RFC 5865 recommends. Presently, RFC 4594 is being 
   updated by [ID-4594-UP] for many reasons, including the inclusion of
   these six new DSCPs.

   These four new video classes differ from their existing counterparts
   in behavior by not being subjected to capacity admission. All of the
   mentioned traffic classes and subsequent DSCPs within RFC 4594 are 
   non-binding, given that it is a non-normative RFC. RFC 4594 also did
   not recommend the need for capacity admission traffic classes (aka 
   with associated DSCP values). This document is symbiotic with 
   [ID-4594-UP] which intends to replace RFC 4594 as a standards track 
   update which includes the new DSCP assignments created within this 
   document.

   Thus, RFC 4594 defined the need for application assignment of 
   certain DSCPs, but only non-normatively. RFC 5865 defined updated 
   DSCP values for a capacity-admitted voice traffic class that is 
   normative. This document takes what was in RFC 4594, creates 4 new 
   capacity-admitted traffic classes and associated DSCPs. This 
   document also moves one non-capacity-admitted traffic class as well 
   as moves the recommended audio/video signaling DSCP value to another
   value.

   Within RFC 5865, there is the specific call for additional DSCPs for
   capacity-admitted traffic flows of real-time rich media (video) 
   flows in Section 3 of that document under the heading "Summary: 
   Changes from RFC 4594". 

   It should be noted here that these flows are typically video flows, 
   and frequently include the audio with the adjoining video traffic 
   within that flow. The details of how that gets sorted out are 
   outside the scope of this document. DiffServ is a known and proven 
   mechanism. This document does not change or challenge the idea that 
   Differentiated Services is a Per Hop Behavior (PHB) mechanism, and 
   does not create a service. Here we merely want to add new DSCP 
   assignments because of how at least some of the world is (or wants 
   to) differentiate video from other traffic, including other video 
   traffic.

   Section 3 will discuss some of the evolution of DSCP assignments, 
   focusing on those aspects pertinent to the creation of these six new
   DSCP values. Section 4 describes and defines each of the six DSCP 
   values being requested. Heavy reliance exists on the text of RFC 
   5865 for its diagrams and charts.  Those were not brought into this 
   document at this time, but could be in the future.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   CAC - defined in RFC 5865

   PHB - defined in RFC 5865

   DSCP - defined in RFC 5865

   Queue - defined in RFC 5865


3.  Evolution of the Proposed DSCPs

   First of all, full consideration of PHBs and DSCPs needs to 
   originate with RFC 2474. Section 6 of that document states the 
   following:

     "The DSCP field within the DS field is capable of conveying 64 
      distinct codepoints.  The codepoint space is divided into 
      three pools for the purpose of codepoint assignment and 
      management: a pool of 32 RECOMMENDED codepoints (Pool 1) to 
      be assigned by Standards Action as defined in [CONS], a pool 
      of 16 codepoints (Pool 2) to be reserved for experimental or 
      Local Use (EXP/LU) as defined in [CONS], and a pool of 16 
      codepoints (Pool 3) which are initially available for 
      experimental or local use, but which should be preferentially 
      utilized for standardized assignments if Pool 1 is ever 
      exhausted. The pools are defined in the following table 
      (where 'x' refers to either '0' or '1'):

      Pool        Codepoint space          Assignment Policy
      ----        ---------------          -----------------

       1            xxxxx0                 Standards Action
       2            xxxx11                 EXP/LU
       3            xxxx01                 EXP/LU (*)

      (*) may be utilized for future Standards Action allocations as
          Necessary"

   The key part of the above quote is 

      "... which should be preferentially utilized for standardized 
       assignments if Pool 1 is ever exhausted..."

   which we here take to mean 'SHOULD NOT use unless you have a really 
   good reason to use'.  We propose what we consider a really good

   reason to use some of the assignments from Pool 3 before Pool 1 is 
   exhausted. One reason for assigning out of Pool 3 is to get similar 
   marking from layer 2 technologies that only have 3 bits to use for 
   their value, not 6 bits. Technologies such as 802.3 Ethernet, 802.11
   Wireless Ethernet, and MPLS are 3 examples of technologies that only
   have 3 bits to use.

   [Editor's Note: If this aspect of assigning DSCPs from Pool 3 before
                   Pool 1 is exhausted requires an update to RFC 2474, 
                   please let the authors know so we can point this out
                   to the community for additional feedback.]

   Just as RFC 5865 matched the first 3 (or 4) bits with EF for 
   Voice-Admit (101110 and 101100), we RECOMMEND the admitted DSCP for 
   an existing value be its XXXX01 version of the non-admitted DSCP 
   (XXXXX0).  We note that the last two bits MUST NOT be x11 because 
   that would mean the value is a Pool 2 value, which is forbidden 
   currently by RFC 2474.

   Thus, a DSCP value commonly traverses a layer 2 device by ignoring 
   the last 3 bits of the DSCP value, i.e., taking EF, which is 101110,
   and reducing it to 101 only, and transmitting this over the layer 2 
   infrastructure.

   RFC 4954, and its intended replacement document [ID-4594-UP], create
   several service classes primarily intended for video traffic with 
   slightly different characteristics. It was stated there that not all
   video DSCP values from RFC 4594 are expected to be within the same 
   network, but that could be the case. 

   RFC 4594 listed these voice and video services classes:

   o  "Telephony" using the EF DSCP

   o  "Realtime Interactive" using the CS4 DSCP

   o  "Multimedia Conferencing" using the AF4X DSCP

   o  "Multimedia Streaming" using the AF3X DSCP

   o  "Broadcast Video" using the CS3 DSCP

   Plus, for Telephony Signaling

   o  "Signaling" using the CS5 DSCP

   [ID-4594-UP] lists these 'non-admitted' voice and video services 
   classes (some with changed service names, as well as some DSCPs 
   changed):

   o  Audio using the EF DSCP

Internet-Draft        New Rich Media (Video) DSCPs             Mar 2012

   o  Video using the AF4X DSCP

   o  Hi-Res using the CS4 DSCP

   o  Realtime-Interactive using the CS5 DSCP

   o  Multimedia Streaming using the AF3X DSCP

   o  Broadcast using the CS3 DSCP

   The Multimedia Conferencing purpose and meaning has been changed 
   within [ID-DSCP-UP], as has its DSCPs, which will be listed in the 
   next set of bullets and defined within this document.

   RFC 5865 created the new capacity-admitted Voice-Admit, which 
   mentions specifically that a reservation protocol, "such as RSVP" is
   used to establish those sessions or traffic flows.

   This document creates six additional services classes that are 
   incorporated into [ID-4594-UP]:

   o  Hi-Res-Admit using the CS4-Admit (100001) DSCP

   o  Realtime-Interactive-Admit using the CS5-Admit (101001) DSCP

   o  Multimedia Conferencing using the MC (011101) DSCP

   o  Multimedia Conferencing-Admit using the MC-Admit (100101) DSCP

   o  Broadcast-Admit using the CS3-Admit (011001) DSCP

   Plus, for Conversational Signaling (a term described in 
   [ID-4594-UP]), which is no longer to use the CS5 DSCP,

   o  "A/V-Sig" using the 010001 DSCP

   The results of this are that the 

   - CS4-Admit is the xxxxx1 version of CS4.

   - CS5-Admit is the xxxxx1 version of CS5.

   - CS3-Admit is the xxxxx1 version of CS3.

   MC-Admit is not the xxxxx1 version of the new MC DSCP value 
   (100101), because there are no more 100xxx values that are 
   available, outside of the two x11 values from Pool 2, which cannot 
   be assigned for public use.

   [Editor's Note:  The author is open to suggestions from the 
                    community for how to resolve this issue, if anyone 
                    considers it an issue.]

   The new goal for the signaling service class is to not be starved. 
   It has been shown that mission critical voice and video call set-up 
   does not require expedited forwarding as a PHB. However, this 
   service class MUST NOT be starved, and so it is RECOMMENDED to use a
   codepoint similar in characteristics to the RFC 4594 (and 
   [ID-4594-UP] defined Low-Latency Data service class of 010xxx.


4.  New DSCP Assignments

4.1 The CS5-Admit PHB

   'CS5-Admit' MUST be used with a capacity-admission signaling 
   procedure similar to what is required of 'Voice-Admit' [RFC5865]. 
   RSVP [RFC2205] and NSIS [RFC4080] are two good examples for 
   data-path signaling for capacity-admission. Neither is mandatory, 
   but one of them SHOULD be used.

   CS5-Admit has traffic characteristics described in [ID-4594-UP].

   The DSCP value requested for CS5-Admit is 101001.


4.2 The CS4-Admit DSCP

   'CS4-Admit' MUST be used with a capacity-admission signaling 
   procedure similar to what is required of 'Voice-Admit' [RFC5865]. 
   RSVP [RFC2205] and NSIS [RFC4080] are two good examples for 
   data-path signaling for capacity-admission. Neither is mandatory, 
   but one of them SHOULD be used.

   CS4-Admit has traffic characteristics described in [ID-4594-UP].

   The DSCP value requested for CS4-Admit is 100001.


4.3 The CS3-Admit DSCP

   'CS3-Admit' MUST be used with a capacity-admission signaling 
   procedure similar to what is required of 'Voice-Admit' [RFC5865]. 
   RSVP [RFC2205] and NSIS [RFC4080] are two good examples for 
   data-path signaling for capacity-admission. Neither is mandatory, 
   but one of them SHOULD be used.

   CS3-Admit has traffic characteristics described in [ID-4594-UP].

   The DSCP value requested for CS3-Admit is 011001.

Internet-Draft        New Rich Media (Video) DSCPs             Mar 2012

4.4 The MC DSCP

   'MC' SHOULD NOT use a capacity-admission signaling procedure. 
   Rather, the MC-Admit is used with a capacity-admission signaling 
   procedure if needed. This PHB MUST be non-admitted.

   MC has traffic characteristics described in [ID-4594-UP].

   The DSCP value requested for MC is 011001.


4.5 The MC-Admit DSCP

   'MC-Admit' MUST be used with a capacity-admission signaling 
   procedure similar to what is required of 'Voice-Admit' [RFC5865]. 
   RSVP [RFC2205] and NSIS [RFC4080] are two good examples for 
   data-path signaling for capacity-admission. Neither is mandatory, 
   but one of them SHOULD be used.

   MC-Admit has traffic characteristics described in [ID-4594-UP].

   The DSCP value requested for MC-Admit is 100101.


4.6 The Conversational Signaling (A/V-Sig) DSCP

   'A/V-Sig' MUST be used with a capacity-admission signaling procedure
   similar to what is required of 'Voice-Admit' [RFC5865]. RSVP 
   [RFC2205] and NSIS [RFC4080] are two good examples for data-path 
   signaling for capacity-admission. Neither is mandatory, but one of 
   them SHOULD be used.

   A/V-Sig has traffic characteristics described in [ID-4594-UP].

   The DSCP value requested for A/V-Sig is 010001.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to make the following registry assignments from 
   Pool 1 and Pool 3 from the dscp-parameters section within IANA. 
   Justification for assigning from Pool 3 is in Section 3 of this 
   document, and are the only possible parallel assignments to existing
   assignments of similar registries - very much for the reason 
   Voice-Admit [RFC5865] was assigned a codepoint similar to EF. That

Internet-Draft        New Rich Media (Video) DSCPs             Mar 2012

   aspect is the main point of this document.

6.1 DSCP Assignments from Pool 1

   The code points described in this document is referred to as the 
   following from Pool 1 and has been requested as follows:

   Sub-registry: Pool 1 Codepoints
   Reference: [RFC2474]
   Registration Procedures: Standards Action

      Registry:
      Name         Space    Reference
      ---------    -------  ---------
      A/V-Sig      010010   [this document]

6.2 DSCP Assignments from Pool 3

   The code points described in this document is referred to as the 
   following from Pool 3 and has been requested as follows:

   Sub-registry: Pool 3 Codepoints
   Reference: [RFC2474]
   Registration Procedures: Standards Action

      Registry:
      Name         Space    Reference
      ---------    -------  ---------
      CS5-Admit    101001   [this document]
      CS4-Admit    100001   [this document]
      CS3-Admit    011001   [this document]
      MC-Admit     100101   [this document]
      MC           011001   [this document]


7.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations are identical to those of RFC 5865. 

   Every newly proposed DSCP (save A/V-Sig) serves the same security 
   risk and properties of the Voice-Admit DSCP. Section 3 of this 
   document discusses why these DSCP values are should be parallel to 
   their non-admitted counterparts, just as Voice-Admit states in RFC 
   5865 it is parallel to the existing (at the time) EF.

   The A/V-Sig merely has a new DSCP name, RFC 4594 currently has this 
   service class called "Signaling", serving the same purpose.
