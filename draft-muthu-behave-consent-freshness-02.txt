Abstract

   Verification of peer consent is necessary in WebRTC deployments to
   ensure that a malicious JavaScript cannot use the browser as a
   platform for launching attacks.  A related problem is session
   liveness.  WebRTC applications may want to detect connection failure
   and take appropriate actions.  This document describes a STUN usage
   that enables a WebRTC browser to perform the following on a candidate
   pair ICE is using for a media component after session establishment:

   1.  Verify the peer consent for continuing to receive traffic.
   2.  Dectect connection failure.

Internet-Draft      STUN Usage for Consent Freshness        January 2013


1.  Introduction

   Consent verification is the mechanism using which WebRTC
   implementations can verify the peer consent for receiving traffic on
   candidate media transport addresses.  This has two parts

   1.  Verifying peer consent for receiving traffic on candidate media
       transport addresses at session establishment.
   2.  Verifying peer consent for continuing to receive traffic on
       candidate media transport addresses after session establishment.

   WebRTC implements are required to perform STUN connectivity checks at
   session establishment as part of ICE procedures [RFC5245].  This
   takes care of the first part of the consent verification described
   above.

   After session establishment ICE requires STUN Binding indications to
   be used for refreshing NAT bindings for a candidate pair ICE is using
   for a media component.  Since a STUN Binding indication does not
   evoke a response, it cannot be used for the second part of the
   consent verification describes above.

   A related problem is session liveness.  WebRTC applications may want
   to detect connection failure on candidate media transport addresses
   after session establishment and take appropriate actions.  Again, the
   STUN Binding indications in ICE sent after session establishment
   cannot be used for determining session liveness.

   This document describes a STUN usage based on STUN request/response
   that enables a WebRTC browser to perform the following on a candidate
   pair ICE is using for a media component after session establishment:

   1.  Verify the peer consent for continuing to receive traffic.
   2.  Dectect connection failure.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft      STUN Usage for Consent Freshness        January 2013


   Consent Freshness:  It is the mechanism of verifying peer consent for
      continuing to receive traffic on a candidate pair ICE is using for
      a media component after ICE has concluded.  This document uses
      completion of session establishment synonymous with the conclusion
      of ICE.

   Session Liveness:  It is the mechanism of detecting connectivity on a
      candidate pair ICE is using for a media component after ICE has
      concluded.

   Transport Address:  The combination of an IP address and port number
      (such as a UDP or TCP port number).


4.  Design Considerations

   As described earlier in this document, STUN indications are not
   suitable for performing consent freshness.  Hence, performing consent
   freshness requires the use of STUN request/response.

   ICE requires the usage of message integrity with STUN using its
   short-term credential mechanism.  The need for this mechanism goes
   beyond just security and is required for the correct operation of the
   ICE connectivity check procedures; without message integrity the
   connectivity checks can yield false positives, as described in
   Appendix B section B.4 of the ICE specification.  However, this
   problem is not applicable for consent freshness, since consent
   freshness is performed only after ICE concludes.

   One of the reasons for ICE choosing STUN Binding indications for
   keepalives is because Binding indication allows integrity to be
   disabled, allowing for better performance.  This is useful for large-
   scale endpoints, such as PSTN gateways and SBCs as described in
   Appendix B section B.10 of the ICE specification.

   STUN requires the 96 bits transaction ID to be uniformly and randomly
   chosen from the interval 0 .. 2**96-1, and be cryptographically
   random.  This is deemed sufficient for consent freshness from a
   security perspective.  However, omitting the MESSAGE-INTEGRITY
   attribute that requires calculating SHA1 from STUN Binding request/
   response would break backward compatibility with ICE/ICE-lite agents.

   Though ICE specifies STUN Binding indications to be used for
   keepalives, it requires that an agent be prepared to receive
   connectivity check as well.  If a connectivity check is received, a
   response is generated, but there is no impact on ICE processing, as
   described in section 10 of the ICE specification.

   The above considerations imply that STUN Binding request/response is
   most suitable for performing consent freshness.


5.  Solution Overview

   The solution uses two timers:

   1.  A consent timer Tc whose value is determined by the browser.
   2.  A packet receipt timer Tr whose value is determined by the
       application.

   A WebRTC browser performs a combined consent freshness and session
   liveness test using STUN resuest/respose as described below:

   o  Starts a consent timer Tc (no less than 15 sec).
   o  Starts a packet receipt timer Tr (no less than 1 sec); application
      configurable.
   o  When either timer expires it starts a STUN transaction.
   o  When the STUN transaction succeeds, it re-starts both timers.
   o  When the STUN transaction fails
      *  If the transaction was started by timer Tc, it stops sending
         traffic on that candidate pair.
      *  Else, it notifies the application of the failure and continues.
   o  It resets timer Tr on receiving any packet from the other side.

   While consent freshness serves as a circuit breaker (if there is a
   failure the WebRTC browser stops sending all traffic on that
   candidate pair), determining session liveness serves the purpose of
   notifying the application of connectivity failure so that the
   application can take appropriate action.


6.  Interaction with Keepalives used for Refreshing NAT Bindings

   An implementation that performs the procedures described in this
   document has no need to also perform the keepalives described in ICE
   [RFC5245] or RTP keepalive [RFC6263], as they both force recurring
   messages to be sent over the UDP port used by RTP.  Thus, an
   implementation that performs the procedures described in this
   document SHOULD NOT also do the keepalives described in ICE [RFC5245]
   or RTP keepalives [RFC6263] for the same UDP port.
