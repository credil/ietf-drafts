    <abstract>
      <t>RFC4090 defines an RSVP fast reroute mechanism for local repairing
      LSP tunnel in the order of 10s milliseconds, in the event of a
      downstream link or node failure. However, the mechanism does not provide
      node protection for LSP egress nodes. This document describes two
      methods to establish a bypass LSP from the penultimate-hop node of an
      LSP to a backup egress node, which could be used to protect the LSP
      against egress node failure. The methods enable local repair in the
      order of 10s of millisecond, in the event of the egress node failure.
      These methods are only applicable if traffic carried by the LSP could be
      rerouted to ultimate destination by the backup egress node.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document define two methods that could enable fast protection
      for egress node failure for RSVP-TE signaled LSP tunnels. Both methods
      have a common concept of primary egress node and backup egress node for
      a tunnel endpoint address. The methods differ by how tunnel endpoints
      are modeled in the network. The primary egress node of an LSP (called
      protected LSP) terminates the LSP in steady state, while a bypass LSP is
      established from the penultimate-hop node to the backup egress node. The
      penultimate-hop node, serving as a PLR (point of local repair),
      redirects traffic to the backup egress node of the LSP via the bypass
      LSP in the event of primary egress node failure, and the backup egress
      node forwards the traffic to the ultimate destination. How the backup
      egress node forwards traffic is beyond the scope this document. For one
      example, the backup egress node could mirror from the primary egress
      node the inner labels (e.g. layer-2/3 VPN service labels) carried by the
      traffic, and forward the traffic based on those labels by using the
      mechanisms specified in [pwe3-endpoint-fast-protection] and
      [l3vpn-egress PE-fast-protection].</t>

      <t>Two methods defined in the documents that enable the backup LSP to
      establish to backup egress.</t>

          <t>Proxy node method</t>

          <t>Alias method</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In the proxy method, an LSP endpoint address is represent as a
      virtual node in the TE domain attached to the primary egress node and
      the backup egress node via bidirectional point-to-point TE links. With
      this representation, the penultimate-hop node of the LSP could use the
      normal procedure of RSVP fast-reroute PLR to set up a bypass LSP to the
      backup egress node, by avoiding the primary egress node. This methed has
      the advantage of not requiring software upgrade on the penultimate-hop
      node, and thus can ease the deployment this technology.</t>

      <t>With proxy method, topology is modeled as figure 2 in the rest of the
      network for LSP destination address x which required egress protection
      and R6 is primary R7 is backup.</t>

      <t>In alias method, an LSP endpoint address is associated with an
      dedicated IP address on the backup egress node. This IP address is
      called an alias. The penultimate-hop node of the LSP may learn the alias
      via IGP or configuration, and use it as the destination when computing a
      path for the bypass LSP. With this method, the penultimate-hop node can
      set up a bypass LSP to the backup egress node, by avoiding the primary
      egress node. This method requires software upgrade penultimate-hop node,
      but is flexile to support all traffic engineering constraints.</t>

        in SESSION_ATTRIBUTE of Path message. In path computation, it MAY

        for the LSP by following the procedure described in RFC 4090. It
        SHOULD set up a bypass LSP to the backup egress node. When computing a

        specific label table where the labels learned from the primary egress
        node are installed. This can facilitate forwarding of traffic when the

        tunnel end point address then it setup bypass-LSP to backup egress if
        it is not setup already. The constrains will be exclude egress node.
        PNH could setup bypass-LSP with destination as backup egress node or

          MUST be backup egress router ID with constrain that LSP cannot
