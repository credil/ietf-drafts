Internet-Draft           Redundant BFD sessions            November 2012


1.  Introduction

   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection [RFC5880] is used to detect
   network failures.  Link failures and peer system outages are some
   examples of failures which can be detected with BFD technology.
   Although undesirable, the BFD technology may falsely declare failure
   in some scenarios: BFD process crash, FPGA reset on hardware based
   BFD, or a card running the BFD functionality fails or gets removed
   accidentally.  In all these cases, the forwarding being monitored by
   BFD may remain functional.  Unnecessary rerouting of traffic, while
   not a problem per-se, can be a problem at a large scale of false BFD
   triggers, e.g. tens of thousands of traffic path.  A serious outcome
   may be seen if a network outage occurs in a time window in which BFD
   is not detecting failures.  For example, during software updates an
   extended timer value may be used, leaving the system and it's peer
   "blind" for any real liveliness problem until the BFD functionality
   is restored.

   This draft proposes to run a second "shadow" BFD session, in parallel
   to the existing "primary" BFD session.  This additional session will
   have it's own unique discriminator value(s).  The method used to
   differentiate discriminator zero primary and shadow sessions is
   discussed in the following sections.


2.  Failure scenarios

   BFD technology requires continuous transmission of control packets in
   both directions.  The rate at which both systems are required to
   transmit these packets will vary depending on operational
   requirements and configurations: BFD mode and interval.  If a BFD
   module on one system is unable to transmit BFD control packets for
   amount of time greater than the negotiated failure detection time,
   then the BFD module on the other system will declare a session
   failure.  Sometimes the cause of such a session failure is not
   related to the functionality of the path being monitored by BFD.

   Some failure scenarios which can exhibit such behaviors are described
   in this section.

   1.  Software based BFD: BFD process crash, CPU starvation.

   2.  Hardware based BFD: FPGA reset.

   3.  System using centralized BFD architecture: Route processor card
       fault.

   4.  System using distributed BFD architecture: Linecard fault.

   Failure scenarios are not limited to the ones described above.  In
   all cases, the reliability of BFD sessions will increase
   significantly if a second BFD instance exists.


3.  Differentiating primary and shadow sessions

   For a single target monitored by BFD, a system needs to run two
   instances of the BFD sessions: a primary session and a shadow
   session.  This requires BFD control packets to have an indication on
   which role they belong.  In other words, every control packet needs
   to have an indication on whether it belongs to the primary or the
   shadow session.

   When looking at the BFD version 1 packet in [RFC5880], there are no
   unused bits left to store a shadow flag to distinguish the primary
   from the shadow session.  One could take away a bit from e.g. the
   Diag, the Multiplier or the Length field, even claiming the least
   significant bit from one of the interval fields.  But none of these
   proposals would be safe against interoperability problems with BFD
   speakers not supporting this draft.

   That leaves three possible options.

   a.  Use of existing BFD version 1 control packet definition will
       indicate a primary BFD session.  Shadow BFD sessions will use
       version 2 in the BFD packets.  Besides usage of different version
       number, all operation will conform to the behaviors described in
       BFD RFCs.  Shadow BFD sessions only handle version 2 BFD packets.
       Primary BFD sessions only handle version 1 BFD packets as
       specified in section 6.8.6 of [RFC5880].

   b.  Define a new BFD packet header for version 2.  This new version
       is to include bits to indicate the session type: primary session
       or shadow session.  Shadow BFD sessions only handle version 2 BFD
       packets with shadow bits set.  Primary BFD sessions handle
       version 1 BFD packets or version 2 BFD packets with primary bits
       set.

   c.  Use information outside the BFD packet.  For IP/UDP encapsulated
       BFD packets this could be a UDP destination port different from
       the well-known ports defined in [RFC5881] and [RFC5883].  For BFD
       over Pseudo Wires [RFC5885] or BFD for MPLS-TP OAM [RFC6428] new
       type values could be used in the PW-ACH and G-ACH to
       differentiate shadow BFD packets from the primary BFD session
       packets.

   Option b redefines the BFD packet contents.  Although it is a clean
   solution, this approach can have a significant impact to existing BFD
   implementations.  Introduction of BFD redundancy capability at
   significant costs is thought to be undesirable, thus this option is
   not recommended.  However, when there is a discussion on defining new
   version of BFD packet contents, addition of redundancy capability
   would be recommended.  Option c will create dependencies with current
   and future BFD RFCs since each will need to define a way shadow
   session can be specified.  Therefore, this option is also not
   recommended.  That leaves option a as the recommended choice.


4.  BFD version 2 packets

   BFD version 2 packets follow exactly the definition given in
   [RFC5880] and other BFD-related RFCs, with one difference that the
   version field contains the value "2".  The packet format is the same
   as described in section 4.1 of [RFC5880].  Implementations following
   this draft MUST be able to receive BFD packets with the version field
   values "1" and "2" and MUST drop BFD packets with any other version
   value.

   BFD packets with a version value of "1" are named "primary" packets
   while BFD packets with a version value of "2" are named "shadow"
   packets within this document.  The primary session MUST only transmit
   and receive primary packets.  The shadow session MUST only transmit
   and receive shadow packets.


5.  BFD discriminators

   As primary sessions and shadow sessions are operating independently,
   they have different my discriminator values.  My discriminator values
   assigned to BFD sessions are unique per system, across the combined
   set of primary and shadow sessions.  In other words, a system will
   have one discriminator pool to be used for both primary and shadow
   sessions, not a pool per session type.


6.  Using primary and shadow BFD sessions

   A shadow BFD session is associated to exactly one primary BFD
   session.  The parameters used by shadow sessions SHOULD be the same
   as the parameters of associated primary session.  Purpose for such is
   to ensure that two sessions operate using the same mode, interval and
   failure detection time.  This allows for the two sessions to behave
   as similar as possible to reduce the chance of them concluding
   deviating state in valid failure scenarios.

   When the BFD shadow capability is enabled to a target, two session
   instances to that target are created: primary and shadow.  A logic
   SHOULD be applied to identify where in the system to host the two
   sessions.  The logic should maximize the failure detection validity
   by minimizing the chances of both sessions being impacted by a single
   local failure.  Details of this logic is outside the scope of this
   document.

   Both the primary and the shadow session are to operate as per
   specified in other BFD RFCs.  A differentiator comes into play
   between state changes of the two sessions and the action taken when
   reachability of the BFD enabled target changes.  This differentiator
   will be referred as the state consolidation module from here onward.
   The purpose of the state consolidation module is to consolidate the
   state of the primary and the shadow session, and to produce a final
   state to be used by the system to take action on.  The logic of the
   state consolidation module is as follows:

   Final state is UP when the state of the primary session is UP or the
   state of the shadow session is UP.

   Final state is DOWN when both the state primary session is DOWN and
   the state of the shadow sessions is DOWN.


7.  Scale aspect

   The BFD module becomes more resilient by enabling the shadow BFD
   capability.  However, when the shadow BFD capability is enabled on a
   system, the total number of BFD sessions hosted on a system will be
   increased by the number of shadow BFD sessions.  For the same number
   of BFD monitored targets, more system resources will be used.
   Solving a scale issue is outside the scope of this document.
   However, below lists some techniques which can be considered:

   1.  Reduce the configured BFD intervals of some or all BFD sessions.

   2.  Allow an implementation to run shadow sessions at a slower rate.


8.  IANA Considerations

   No work requested from IANA.


9.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any additional security issues and
