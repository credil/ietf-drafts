Internet-Draft                   L2TP-VP                    October 2013


1.  Introduction

   Traditional data centre network uses global VLAN ID to distinguish
   different tenants.  Usually, a tenant consumes several VLAN IDs, for
   example, one for web server, one for application server and one for
   database server.  When the number of tenants increases, the number of
   available VLAN IDs becomes rare.

   When services provisioned from cloud via Internet becomes popular, a
   tenant's local area network needs to securely and smoothly reach
   anywhere via Internet if it wants.  For example, a tenant can access
   its office IT services hosted in cloud data centers consisting of
   many geographically dispersed physical data centers.  Traditional
   L2VPN technologies seems to be burdened heavily.

   Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3) [RFC3931] is a
   mature and practical protocol that provides secure remote access
   service and layer 2 over IP service, but L2TPv3 aslo uses complicated
   control messages to setup tunnel.  At the same time, L2TPv3 uses
   dynamical session id that is controlled by signaling mechanism and
   only has local significance, i.e., L2TPv3 is complex and does not
   support multiple tenants though it provides basic overlay functions.

   This document will describe Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)'s
   virtualization profile (L2TP-VP), which reuses session header of L2TP
   data message to securely support overlay networks for multiple
   tenants, and simplifies tunnel setup by disabling all kinds of L2TP
   control messages.  Essentially, L2TP-VP defines a subset of L2TPv3
   via fine and back-compatible reuse, and then extends L2TP's usage to
   network virtualization.  L2TP is widely deployed and used whatever
   for operators' network or enterprises' network, L2TP-VP brings L2TP
   to the entire cloud network by further covering data center network.

3.  L2TP-VP Frame Format

   L2TPv3 message format is specified in [RFC3931].  In order to support
   virtualization and reduce complexity from the control messages, two
   key fields are added into L2TP header to carry the original payload
   type and TNI (Tenant Network Identifier).The example of packet format
   for Ethernet encapsulation in L2TP-VP is shown in Figure 1.

                Figure 1 L2TP-VP Encapsulation Frame Format

   The original Ethernet frame is encapsulated with L2TP-VP Header,
   Outer IP Header and Outer Ethernet Header.

   L2TP-VP Header:

   o  Type field : A 16-bit field is used to carry original payload type
      (e.g., frame type).  Payload type can be Layer2 type such as ATM,
      FR, Ethernet, etc.  It also can be Layer3 type such as IPv4 , IPv6
      ,etc.  In Figure 1 the type of original packet is Ethernet;

   o  TNI field : A 24-bit field allows up to 16 million tenants in the
      same management domain.  The packets with different TNI will be
      isolated logically;

   o  Cookie field : The optional Cookie field inherits all the
      functions from cookie field in [RFC3931] .  It is used to check
      the association of a received data message with TNI.Only need to
      change its length to be 32-bit.

   Outer IP Header: Both IPv4 and IPv6 can be used as encapsulation IP
   header.  Figure 1 shows an example of IPv4.  The source IP address is
   filled with IP address of L2TP-VP endpoint which encapsulates the
   original packet with L2TP-VP frame format.  The destination IP
   address is unicast address obtained by lookup of address table.  Also
   it may be a multicast address representing this packet may be used
   for address learning.

   Outer Ethernet Header: The destination MAC address in Figure 1 may be
   the address of next hop device.  The Optional Vlan Tag may be used to
   limit the area of the broadcast.

4.  Control Plane Consideration

   In order to reduce complexity coming from control messages, there is
   no separate control plane in L2TP-VP.  All kinds of control messages
   defined in [RFC3931] are disabled.  All tunnel endpoints are expected
   to be configured by management plane(e.g., OSS).

5.  Data Plane Consideration

5.1.  Address Learning

   For the E2E link and tunnel setup of L2TP-VP overlay network, the
   forwarding information including tenant systems' address, and its
   associated L2TP-VP endpoint address and TNI should be populated in
   the network.  There are several options to support address learning:

   o  Through the management plane, L2TP-VP endpoints will be configured
      part or all of the address table;

   o  L2TP-VP endpoints directly acquire the forwarding information
      through data plane by flooding mechanism;

   o  L2TP-VP endpoints join the multicast group and populate the
      forwarding information to the other endpoints in the same virtual
      network by the multicast tree.

5.2.  Forwarding

5.2.1.  Unicast Traffic

   Ingress L2TP-VP endpoint firstly gets the destination address from
   the unicast traffic, then obtains IP address of the egress endpoint
   and the TNI by lookup of address table, at last encapsulates the
   original packet in L2TP-VP frame format.  The source IP address in
   outer IP header is filled with its own IP address and the destination
   IP address is filled with egress endpoint's IP address.

5.2.2.  Broadcast/Unknown/Multicast(BUM) Traffic

   There are several proven methods to process BUM traffic.

   One method needs the multicast support of underlay network.  All BUM
   traffic originating from within a TNI is terminated by the L2TP-VP
   endpoint, then encapsulated and sent to the assigned multicast
   address.  The binding relation of the TNI and the multicast address
   of underlay network can be configured by the management plane.

   Another method is ingress replication.  One BUM frame in a TNI can be
   replicated to multiple unicast frames which will be sent to all the
   egress L2TP-VP endpoints in the same TNI.

5.3.  MTU Configuration

   L2TP-VP overlay header can cause the MTU of the path to the egress
   tunnel endpoint to be exceeded.  Here lists some solutions:

Internet-Draft                   L2TP-VP                    October 2013


   o  Modifying the MTU support configuration in the network devices,
      including L2TP-VP endpoints and other network devices which will
      transmit the encapsulation packets;

   o  Classical ICMP-based MTU Path Discovery [RFC1191] [RFC1981] or
      Extended MTU Path Discovery techniques such as defined in
      [RFC4821].

5.4.  Qos Consideration

   QoS of underlay network can be provided without problem due to the
   fact that it's an IP network.

   QoS of the overlay network may need to support the mapping of CoS
   marking between different network layers (e.g., Tenant Systems,
   Overlays, and/or Underlay) in L2TP-VP endpoints, for enabling each
   networking layer to independently enforce its own CoS policies.

   TS's QoS fields (e.g.  IP DSCP and/or Ethernet 802.1p) and policies
   can be defined to indicate application level CoS requirements.
   L2TP-VP endpoint can use the new service CoS fields in the overlay
   header to indicate the proper service CoS to be applied across the
   overlay network.  This field can be mapped from the TS's QoS fields
   or other mechanism (e.g.  DPI).

5.5.  ECMP

   Because the outer header is standard IP header, the L2TP-VP endpoint
   SHOULD provide ECMP.  Basically the L2TP-VP endpoint uses a hash of
   various fields of the outer Ethernet header and outer IP header,
   furthermore it can uses the fields of L2TP-VP header or even inner
   original packet.  And the endpoint can select different fields for
   hash according to the requirement.

6.  Management Plane Consideration

   Management plane is needed to configure access type, TNI, QoS,
   Cookie, etc.  In some scenarios, management plane should support to
   configure the forwarding information or policies for data plane and
   control plane , such as routing table, address table, etc.
   Management plane can be OSS or SDN controller.

8.  Security Considerations

   Like L2TPv3, L2TP-VP continues to adopt Cookie Field as an additional
   check to the received packet.  A 32-bit random field is difficult to
   be cracked so that it can afford protection against brute-force,
   blind and insertion attacks.

   When the network is open network and someone can sniff the whole
   traffic through the network , it will need other security measures.
   Traditional security mechanisms based on IP technique will provide
   authentication/encryption function ,such as IPSec.
