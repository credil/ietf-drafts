        Non-TCP based Feedback for Congestion Exposure
       draft-karagiannis-conex-congestion-calculation-02


Abstract

   This document describes a procedure that allows receivers to compute 
   the congestion from the received congestion information and to 
   communicate this information back to the sender using non-TCP based 
   protocols. The main advantage of this approach is that 
   applications that are not using the TCP protocol as transport 
   protocol could also apply the Conex concept to rely congestion 
   experienced on the end-to-end path back into the network.

Internet-Draft Congestion exposure using non-TCP        July 2011

1.  Introduction

   The ConEx working group is defining how IP packets will carry 
   additional ConEx information. This document describes a solution 
   used to feedback congestion information calculated at the receiver, 
   back to the sender using non-TCP based protocols.
   
   In [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01] a method is described on (1) 
   using ECN marks and packet drops to calculate the end-to-end path 
   congestion at the receiver, (2) feedback this congestion information 
   back to the sender using the TCP transport protocol, see also [draft-
   kuehlewind-conex-accurate-ecn-00] (3) relaying the congestion that 
   has been experienced on the end-to-end path back into the network 
   in-band at the IP layer, such that the total level of congestion is 
   visible to all IP devices along the path. 

   This draft specifies a procedure that allows receivers to compute the 
   congestion from the received congestion information and to 
   communicate this information back to the sender using non-TCP based 
   protocols. The main advantage of this approach is that applications 
   that are not using the TCP protocol as transport protocol could also 
   apply the Conex concept to rely congestion experienced on the end-to-
   end path back into the network.

   This procedure is used as part of sequence of operation where (1) the 
   receiver using ECN marks and packet drops computes the end-to-end 
   path loss event rate, (2) the receiver feed this end-to-end path loss 
   event rate information back to the sender using a non-TCP transport 
   protocol, such as the DCCP transport protocol [RFC4340] together with 
   [RFC4342] or [RFC5622]. Subsequently, in (3) the sender computes the 
   congestion at the sender, and (4) relays the congestion that has 
   been experienced on the end-to-end path back into the network in-
   band at the IP layer, such that the total level of congestion is 
   visible to all Conex Enabled IP devices along the path.

   2. Method of using non-TCP related feedback for congestion exposure 

   This document provides a method, see Figure 1, on (1) using ECN marks 
   and packet drops to calculate the end-to-end path loss event rate at 
   the receiver, which is identical to the one specified in [draft-ietf-
   conex-abstract-mech-01]), (2) feedbacking congestion information 
   calculated at the receiver, back to the sender by using non-TCP based 
   protocols, for example DCCP [RFC4340], [RFC5622], [RFC4342], (3) the 
   sender computes the congestion at the sender, (4) relaying the 
   congestion that has been experienced on the end-to-end path back into 
   the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total level of 
   congestion is visible to all Conex Enabled IP devices along the path,  
   which identical to the one specified in 
   [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01]).

     2.1. Congestion exposure method overview

   The following paragraphs described each of the steps of the proposed 
   method:

   1) In the first step, the end-to-end path 
   loss event rate is calculated at the receiver using ECN marks 
   and packet drops. This rate can be calculated using different 
   algorithms. As example, the loss event rate calculation specified in 
   [RFC5348] (in combination with [RFC4342]) or [RFC4828] (in 
   combination with [RFC5622]) can be used for this purpose. For a 
   normative specification of the loss event rate see Section 5 of 
   [RFC5348] and [RFC4828].

Internet-Draft Congestion exposure using non-TCP        July 2011

   2) In the second step, the receiver sends this 
   end-to-end path loss event rate information back to the sender using 
   a non-TCP transport protocol, such as the DCCP transport protocol, 
   see [RFC4340], [RFC5622] or [RFC4342]. In this case, the receiver 
   reports using DCCP-Ack packets, among others, the number of loss 
   event rate by using the Loss event rate option, described in Section 
   8.5 of [RFC4342].  

   3) In the third step, the sender calculates the path congestion 
   at the sender (to which the feedback is directed). The congestion at 
   the sender is calculated using the congestion computed at the 
   receiver, e.g., the loss event rate. This step can be realized using 
   different algorithms, e.g., see [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01]).
   Moreover, in this step the congestion exposure signals can be encoded 
   using the same method specified in [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-
   01]).

   4) In the fourth step the congestion exposure signals are relayed 
   back into the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total 
   level of congestion is visible to Conex Enabled IP devices along the 
   path. This information MAY also be relayed to non co-located traffic 
   managers.

   Note that steps 1 and 2 are common with the Throughput exposure 
   approach documented in 
   [draft-karagiannis-conex-throughput-exposure-03]. Making this 
   approach common to both types of exposures.

2.2.  Requirements for the ConEx Signal

      The following requirements apply to the Conex exposure signal, 
      which are in line with most of the requirements presented in 
     [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01]:

       o) The ConEx Signal SHOULD be visible to internetwork layer 
          devices along the entire path from the transport sender to the 
          transport receiver.  

       o) The ConEx Signal SHOULD be useful under only partial 
          deployment.

       o) The ConEx Signal SHOULD be timely.  

       o) The ConEx Signal SHOULD be accurate (i.e., such that the 
          signaled congestion is represented accurately).

2.3.  Codepoint Encoding

   An identical encoding is used as the one specified in [draft-ietf-
   conex-abstract-mech-01]. 

2.4. Conex Components
  
   The same Conex enabled devices can be used as the ones specified in   
  [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01].

2.4.1 Modified Senders 

   The senders SHOULD support the protocol that is carrying the 
   congestion information from the receiver to the sender. Moreover, the 
   sender should implement an algorithm that can use the feedback 
   congestion information to calculate the congestion at the 
   sender. As example, if DCCP in combination with the TCP-Friendly Rate 
   Control (TFRC) is used, then the solutions specified in e.g., 
   [RFC5348] (in combination with [RFC4342]) or [RFC4828] (in 
   combination with [RFC5622]) SHOULD be supported. 
   In addition, the sender MUST be able to encode the calculated 
   congestion at the sender into Conex Exposure Signals. This 
   latter procedure is the same as the same procedure used by [draft-
   ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01].

2.4.2 Intermediate Conex Enabled Devices

   The same intermediate Conex enabled devices could be used as the 
   intermediate Conex enabled devices specified in [draft-ietf-conex-  
   abstract-mech-01], e.g., Policer and Audit. 

2.4.3 Modified Receivers 

   The receiver SHOULD be able to calculate the congestion at the 
   receiver, which needs to be forwarded at the sender.

   Moreover, the receivers should be able to support the same transport 
   protocol supported by the sender used to feedback the calculated 
   congestion information from the receiver to the sender. 
   As example, if DCCP in combination with the TCP-Friendly Rate 
   Control (TFRC) is used then the solutions specified in e.g., 
   [RFC5348] (in combination with [RFC4342]) or [RFC4828] (in 
   combination with [RFC5622]) SHOULD be applied.
