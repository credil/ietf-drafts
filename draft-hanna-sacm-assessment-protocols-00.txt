1. Introduction

   The draft charter for the SACM BOF at IETF 85 [1] calls for the
   development of "continuous assessment interfaces". This text from
   the draft charter provides more detail about what's desired:

      2. Define, either by normative reference, adoption, or creation,
      a set of standards that can be used to continuously assess and
      report on the state of systems, composed of many different types
      of devices and networks, operated by varying personnel, to ensure
      security process effectiveness in a pre-defined or ad-hoc manner.
      This area of focus provides for integration protocols supporting
      plug and play continuous assessment and security automation
      networking within an enterprise.

   Actually, there are several specifications from IETF and other
   organizations that provide a very good start on addressing this
   problem. More work is certainly needed but the SACM BOF should be
   aware of these documents.

2. Languages and Enumerations

   The SCAP specification [2] lists a large number of languages and
   enumerations that are useful for remote security assessment: XCCDF
   [3], OVAL [4], OCIL [5], Asset Identification [6], CCE [7], CPE [8],
   and CVE [9]. Since there is a great deal of implementation

   experience with these specifications, they should certainly be
   considered by the SACM BOF or any successor Working Group.

3. Protocols

   The IETF NEA Working Group has defined an architecture and a layered
   set of protocols for remote assessment of endpoint security posture:
   the NEA Architecture [10], PA-TNC [11], PB-TNC [12], PT-TLS [13],
   and PT-EAP [14]. These protocols are designed to be used either at
   the time that an endpoint connects to a network or continuously
   after the endpoint is connected to the network.

   The NEA protocols are based on the Trusted Network Connect (TNC)
   protocols, which were created by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG)
   and donated to the IETF. The TCG contributed the TNC specifications
   to the IETF in full compliance with BCP 78 [15] and BCP 79 [16],
   transferring change control and copyright to the IETF (among other
   things). The IETF took full advantage of this change control,
   adopting the TNC standards through an open and competitive process
   but adapting them to the IETF's needs and processes. For example,
   the IETF renamed all the TNC protocols: IF-M became PA-TNC, IF-TNCCS
   became PB-TNC, IF-T Binding for TLS became PT-TLS, and IF-T Binding
   for Tunneled EAP Methods became PT-EAP.

   Because the NEA protocols are based on the TNC protocols, they
   benefit from the experiences of and feedback from millions of users,
   thousands of customers, and dozens of vendors and open source
   implementers who have used the TNC protocols. For example, users
   strongly prefer quick and efficient checks when waiting to get on
   the network. Therefore, all the NEA protocols use a binary encoding
   and minimize round trips. Still, vendors need extensibility so the
   NEA specs permit vendor-specific extensions while requiring that
   vendors work without them.

   Two of the NEA protocols (PA-TNC and PB-TNC) were published as
   Proposed Standards in 2010. At the same time, the TCG issued updated
   TNC protocol specs (IF-M 1.0 [17] and IF-TNCCS 2.0 [18]) that
   correspond exactly to the NEA specs, thus ensuring that the two
   architectures remain in alignment. The other two NEA specs (PT-TLS
   and PT-EAP) are expected to be published as Proposed Standards
   within the next few months. TCG may reasonably be expected to again
   issue updated versions of the corresponding TNC specs to maintain
   alignment. Customer and vendor adoption is expected to be rapid for
   these specs since the old versions were widely implemented and the
   new specs are a simple upgrade from the old. Even vendors who have
   long used proprietary protocols have indicated their plans to
   support the new open standard protocols.

4. Merging The Two

   While the NEA protocols define the format for some simple posture
   checks (anti-virus or host firewall status, OS patch level), they do
   not define standards that approach the level of detail that
   sophisticated enterprise customers need and can achieve with SCAP.

   At the same time, SCAP does not define any standards for gathering
   SCAP content from an endpoint. This is left to the vendor, resulting
   in a situation where each vendor must place a software agent on the
   endpoint in order to assess that endpoint (or settle for an external
   scan, which has lower fidelity).

   What's needed to fully satisfy the SACM BOF's charter item on
   continuous assessment interfaces is a standard for conveying the
   SCAP languages and enumerations in the NEA protocols.

   Fortunately, the TCG has recently published exactly this document.
   The TCG's SCAP Messages for IF-M specification [19] was published
   for Public Review on TCG's web site on October 3, 2012. This
   document describes how SCAP content should be carried over the NEA
   (TNC) protocols. It includes support for provisioning SCAP content
   to endpoints, for rapidly and efficiently gathering assessment
   results when a device connects to the network, for gathering
   exhaustive information in the background after the device is
   connected to the network, and for continuously monitoring changes to
   configuration.

   While the TCG has not made any official statements about its intent
   with respect to donating this specification to IETF, I believe that
   the TCG would be glad to do so if the IETF charters a Working Group
   to work on continuous assessment interfaces. I should know about
   this. I'm co-chair of the TCG's Trusted Network Connect Work Group.

5. Next Steps

   The SACM BOF participants should review the new SCAP Messages for
   IF-M specification to see if it meets their needs. If they find
   deficiencies, they should notify the TCG by sending email to
   SCAP-Messages-Comments@trustedcomputinggroup.org.

   Within IETF, we should review and discuss these documents to see if
   they are relevant to the SACM effort. Do they meet the need for
   continuous assessment interfaces that was described in the proposed
   SACM charter? If not, what changes are needed? Could those changes
   be made using these specs as a starting point, assuming that the TCG
   donated the specs to the IETF with all rights and full change

   control? And should this work happen in a new Working Group or
   should it happen in the NEA Working Group, which already has five
   years of experience with this topic.

   The IETF discussions should happen on the sacm@ietf.org list. I
   would also be glad to lead a discussion of this topic at the SACM
   BOF at IETF 85.

6. Security Considerations

   This document describes several existing standards relating to
   endpoint assessment and configuration management. Each of these
   specifications includes its own Security Considerations section so
   the reader is referred to those documents for more details.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
