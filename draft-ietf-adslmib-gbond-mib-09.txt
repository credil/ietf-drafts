Abstract

   This document defines Management Information Base (MIB) module for
   use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   This document proposes an extension to the Interfaces Group MIB with
   a set of common objects for managing multi-pair bonded Digital
   Subscriber Line (xDSL) interfaces, defined in ITU-T recommendations
   G.998.1, G.998.2 and G.998.3.  The MIB modules specific to each
   bonding technology are defined in GBOND-ATM-MIB, GBOND-ETH-MIB and
   GBOND-TDIM-MIB respectively.

Internet-Draft                 G.Bond MIB                       Feb 2012


1.  Introduction

   The xDSL Multi-Pair Bonding, allows a service provider to provide
   high bandwidth services to business and residential customers over
   multiple xDSL lines, with greater speed and resiliency, than the
   service over a single xDSL line, bridging the gap between xDSL and
   fiber-based transport.

   There are three xDSL Multi-Pair Bonding schemes, also known under
   collective name G.Bond:

   o  The ATM-Based Multi-Pair Bonding, specified in ITU-T G.998.1
      recommendation [G.998.1], which defines a method for bonding (or
      aggregating) of multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer channels
      in multiple xDSL lines) into a single bi-directional logical link
      carrying an ATM stream.  This specification can be viewed as an
      evolution of the legacy Inverse Multiplexing over ATM (IMA)
      technology [af-phy-0086], applied to xDSL with variable rates on
      each line/bearer channel.

   o  The Ethernet-Based Multi-Pair Bonding, specified in ITU-T G.998.2
      recommendation [G.998.2], which defines a method for bonding (or
      aggregating) of multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer channels
      in multiple xDSL lines) into a single bi-directional logical link
      carrying an Ethernet stream.  This specification can be viewed as
      IEEE 802.3-2005 [802.3] Clause 61 Physical Medium Entity (PME)
      Aggregation, generalized to work over any xDSL technology
      (2Base-TL and 10Pass-TS interfaces defined by IEEE use G.SHDSL and
      VDSL technology respectively).

   o  The Multi-pair bonding using time-division inverse multiplexing
      (TDIM), specified in ITU-T G.998.3 recommendation [G.998.3], which
      defines a method for bonding (or aggregating) of multiple xDSL
      lines into a single bi-directional logical link carrying a mix of
      various traffic streams (e.g., Ethernet, ATM, TDM).

   Architecturally all three bonding schemes define a new "bonded"
   Transport Protocol Specific - Transmission Convergence (TPS-TC) sub-
   layer, stacked above multiple ATM-TC, Ethernet/PTM-TC or STM-TC
   (clear channel) sub-layers for the ATM, Ethernet or TDIM bonding
   respectively.  Each underlying TPS-TC sub-layer represents a protocol
   specific interface to an xDSL line or an individual bearer channel of
   an xDSL line.  Bonding of multiple bearer channels in the same xDSL
   line is not allowed.

   All schemes allow bonding of up to 32 individual line/channel sub-
   layers with variable rates, providing common functionality for the
   configuration, initialization, operation and monitoring of the bonded

   link.

   This document defines a MIB module common to all 3 schemes.
   Additional managed objects, specific to each bonding technology, are
   defined in GBOND-ATM-MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-atm-mib], GBOND-ETH-
   MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-eth-mib] and GBOND-TDIM-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-tdim-mib] modules.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This document specifies a
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC
   2580 [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The DSL Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding

   This document makes use of the DSL Forum technical report Management
   Framework for xDSL Bonding [TR-159], defining a management model and
   a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded xDSL interfaces.

4.  Relationship to Other MIB modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB), Inverse Stack Table MIB (IF-INVERTED-STACK-MIB)
   Interface Stack Capability MIB (IF-CAP-STACK-MIB), G.Bond scheme
   specific modules: G.Bond/ATM (GBOND-ATM-MIB), G.Bond/Ethernet (GBOND-
   ETH-MIB) and G.Bond/TDIM (GBOND-TDIM-MIB), and DSL specific MIB
   modules: ADSL (ADSL-LINE-EXT-MIB), ADSL2 (ADSL2-LINE-MIB), SHDSL
   (HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB), VDSL (VDSL-LINE-MIB) and VDSL2 (VDSL2-LINE-
   MIB).

4.1.  Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB module

   A bonded xDSL port is a stacked (a.k.a. aggregated or bonded)
   interface and as such is managed using generic interface management
   objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].

   The stack management, i.e., actual connection of the sub-layers to
   the top layer interface, is done via the ifStackTable, as defined in
   the IF-MIB [RFC2863] and its inverse ifInvStackTable, as defined in
   the IF-INVERTED-STACK-MIB [RFC2864].

   The ifCapStackTable and its inverse ifInvCapStackTable defined in the
   IF-CAP-STACK-MIB [RFC5066], extend the stack management with an
   ability to describe possible connections or cross-connect capability,
   when a flexible cross-connect matrix is present between the interface
   layers.

4.1.1.  Layering Model

   A G.Bond interface can aggregate up to 32 channel sub-layers, with
   each channel representing an xDSL line or an xDSL bearer channel.
   For the purpose of brevity we will refer to the bonded interface as
   Generic Bonded Sub-layer (GBS) and to the channel sub-layer as
   Bonding Channel Entity (BCE).

   A generic G.Bond device can have a number of GBS ports, each
   connected to a particular upper layer (e.g., Media Access Control
   (MAC) interface for G.998.2 scheme), while simultaneously cross-
   connected to a number of underlying BCEs, with a single GBS per BCE
   relationship.

   A GBS port is represented in the Interface table (ifTable) as a
   separate interface with an ifType of g9981(263), g9982(264) or
   g9983(265) for a particular bonding scheme.

   Each BCE in the aggregated GBS port is represented in the ifTable as
   a separate interface with an ifType relevant to a particular xDSL
   technology, e.g., shdsl(169) or vdsl(97).  The ifType values are
   defined in [IANAifType-MIB].

            Figure 1: Use of ifTable for bonded xDSL interfaces

   The ifStackTable is indexed by the ifIndex values of the aggregated
   G.Bond port (GBS) and the BCEs connected to it. ifStackTable allows a
   Network Management application to determine which BCEs are connected
   to a particular GBS and change connections (if supported by the
   application).  The ifInvStackTable, being an inverted version of the
   ifStackTable, provides an efficient means for a Network Management
   application to read a subset of the ifStackTable and thereby
   determine which GBS runs on top of a particular BCE.

   The ifCapStackTable defined in the IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module, specifies
   for each higher-layer interface (e.g., GBS port) a list of lower-
   layer interfaces (e.g., BCEs), which can possibly be cross-connected
   to that higher-layer interface, determined by the cross-connect
   capability of the device.  This table, modeled after ifStackTable, is
   read only, reflecting current cross-connect capability of a stacked
   interface, which can be dynamic in some implementations (e.g., if
   xDSL lines are located on a pluggable module and the module is pulled
   out).  Note that BCE availability per GBS, described by
   ifCapStackTable, can be constrained by other parameters, for example
   by aggregation capacity of a GBS or by the BCE in question being
   already connected to another GBS.  So, in order to ensure that a
   particular BCE can be connected to the GBS, all respective parameters
   (e.g., ifCapStackTable, ifStackTable and gBondPortCapCapacity) SHALL
   be inspected.

   The ifInvCapStackTable, also defined in the IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module,

Internet-Draft                 G.Bond MIB                       Feb 2012


   describes which higher-layer interfaces (e.g., GBS ports) can
   possibly be connected to a particular lower-layer interface (e.g.,
   BCE), providing inverted mapping of ifCapStackTable.  While it
   contains no additional information beyond that already contained in
   the ifCapStackTable, the ifInvCapStackTable has the ifIndex values in
   its INDEX clause in the reverse order, i.e., the lower-layer
   interface first, and the higher-layer interface second, providing
   efficient means for a Network Management application to read a subset
   of the ifCapStackTable and thereby determine which interfaces can be
   connected to run on top of a particular interface.

4.1.2.  xDSL Bonding

   The G.998.x Bonding allows a number of BCEs to be aggregated onto a
   single logical GBS port, by splitting the incoming traffic into
   multiple streams, transmitting each stream over a specific BCE and
   combining the streams at the remote GBS port, preserving the original
   traffic order.

   The Ethernet frames MAY be fragmented before the transmission and
   reassembled at the remote end to minimize transportation delay.

   The Bonding is OPTIONAL, meaning that a device with a single BCE MAY
   perform fragmentation and re-assembly if this function is supported
   by the device.  The agent is REQUIRED to indicate the Bonding
   capability for all types of G.Bond ports (ATM, Ethernet and TDIM).

   The GBOND-MIB module allows a Network Management application to query
   Bonding capability and enable/disable it if supported.  Note that
   enabling Bonding effectively turns on fragmentation and re-assembly
   function, even on a single-BCE port.

4.1.3.  Discovery Operation

   The G.Bond ports may optionally support discovery operation, whereby
   BCEs, during initialization, exchange information about their
   respective aggregation groups (GBS), via [G.994.1] handshake (G.hs)
   protocol.  This information can then be used to detect copper
   misconnections or for an automatic assignment of the local BCEs into
   aggregation groups instead of a fixed pre-configuration.

   The MIB module defined in this document allow a Network Management
   application to control G.Bond discovery mechanism and query its
   results.

   Two tables are used by the G.Bond discovery mechanism: ifStackTable
   and ifCapStackTable.  The following pseudo-code gives an example of
   the discovery and automatic BCE assignment for a generic multi-GBS

   Adding a BCE to the ifStackTable row for a specific GBS, involves
   actual connection of the BCE to the GBS.

   Note that GBS port does not have to be operationally 'down' for the
   connection to succeed.  In fact, a dynamic BCE addition (and removal)
   MAY be implemented with an available BCE being initialized first (by
   setting its ifAdminStatus to 'up') and then added to an operationally
   'up' GBS port, by modifying a respective ifStackTable (and respective
   ifInvStackTable) entry.

   It is RECOMMENDED that a removal of the last operationally 'up' BCE
   from an operationally 'up' GBS, i.e. modification of a respective
   entry in ifStackTable and a corresponding entry in ifInvStackTable,
   would be rejected by the implementation (in case of SNMP with the
   error inconsistentValue), as this action would completely drop the
   link.

   In addition to the standard handshake-based discovery described
   above, [G.998.2] defines an optional frame-based discovery and pair
   management.  These frame-based methods are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-eth-mib].

4.1.4.  G.Bond ports initialization

   G.Bond ports being built on top of xDSL technology, require a lengthy
   initialization or 'training' process, before any data can pass.

   During this initialization both ends of a link (peers) work
   cooperatively to achieve required data rate on a particular copper
   pair.  Sometimes, when the copper line is too long or the noise on
   the line is too high, that 'training' process may fail to achieve a
   specific target rate with required characteristics.

   The ifAdminStatus object from the IF-MIB, controls the desired state
   of a GBS with all the BCEs connected to it or of an individual BCE
   port.  Setting this object to 'up' instructs a particular GBS or a
   BCE to start initialization process, which may take tens of seconds
   for G.Bond ports.  The ifOperStatus object from the IF-MIB shows the
   operational state of an interface for GBS, extended by
   gBondPortStatFltStatus object defined in this document, and
   corresponding *Status object from a relevant xDSL line MIB for BCE
   interfaces.

   A disconnected BCE may be initialized by changing the ifAdminState
   from 'down' to 'up'.  Changing the ifAdminState to 'up' on the GBS
   initializes all BCEs connected to that particular GBS.  Note that in
   case of bonding some interfaces may fail to initialize while others
   succeed.  The GBS is considered operationally 'up' if at least one
   bonded BCE is operationally 'up'.  When all BCEs connected to the GBS
   are 'down' the GBS SHALL be considered operationally
   'lowerLayerDown'.  The GBS SHALL be considered operationally
   'notPresent' if it is not connected to any BCE.  The GBS/BCE
   interface SHALL remain operationally 'down' during initialization,
   indicated by 'init' value of the gBondPortStatFltStatus object.

4.1.5.  Usage of ifTable

   Both BCE and GBS interfaces are managed using interface specific
   management objects defined in the GBOND-MIB module and generic
   interface objects from the ifTable of IF-MIB, with all management
   table entries referenced by the interface index ifIndex.

   The following table summarizes G.Bond specific interpretations for
   some of the ifTable objects specified by the mandatory
   ifGeneralInformationGroup:

4.2.  Relationship to G.Bond ATM, ETH and TDIM MIB modules

   The MIB module defined in this document is common to all three G.998
   bonding schemes.  It MUST be used in conjunction with a bonding
   scheme-specific MIB module:

   o  GBOND-ATM-MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-atm-mib] for a G.998.1
      bonded interface.

Internet-Draft                 G.Bond MIB                       Feb 2012


   o  GBOND-ETH-MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-eth-mib] for a G.998.2
      bonded interface.

   o  GBOND-TDIM-MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-tdim-mib] for a G.998.3
      bonded interface.

4.3.  Relationship to xDSL MIB modules

   Each xDSL technology is described in a relevant xDSL line MIB module:
   e.g., HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB [RFC4319] for G.SHDSL, ADSL-LINE-EXT-MIB
   [RFC3440] for ADSL, ADSL2-LINE-MIB [RFC4706] for ADSL2, VDSL-LINE-MIB
   [RFC3728] for VDSL or VDSL2-LINE-MIB [RFC5650] for VDSL2.

   These MIB moduless are used to manage individual xDSL lines/channels
   (BCEs).

5.  MIB Structure

5.1.  Overview

   The main management objects defined in the GBOND-MIB module are split
   into 2 groups, structured as recommended by RFC 4181 [RFC4181]:

   o  gBondPort - containing objects for configuration, capabilities,
      status, historical performance monitoring and notifications,
      common to all G.Bond ports (GBS).

   o  gBondBce - containing a single common object for configuration of
      the remote discovery code per BCE.  Note that the rest of the
      objects for BCE configuration, capabilities, status and
      notifications, is located in relevant xDSL line MIB modules as
      well as in the bonding scheme specific MIB modules.

5.2.  Performance Monitoring

   The OPTIONAL performance monitoring counters, thresholds and history
   buckets (interval-counters) defined in [TR-159] are implemented using
   the textual conventions defined in the HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3705].
   The HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB defines 64-bit versions of the textual
   conventions found in PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3593].

   The agent SHOULD align the beginning of each interval to a fifteen
   minute boundary of a wall clock.  Likewise, the beginning of each one
   day intervals SHOULD be aligned with the start of a day.

   The rationale behind it is to simplify collection and analysis of the
   PM from multiple agents by a network management system (NMS) - each
   PM interval can be "time-stamped" using the gBond*IntervalIndex

   object, the fact that 1-day interval starts at 00:00 and 15-min
   intervals are aligned with 1/4 hour and the network-wide "wall
   clock", typically distributed via NTP or SNTP.  If the agent does not
   have an access to the wall clock, a local clock can be used.  In this
   case, as well as when coping with multiple time zones, the NMS would
   have to correlate for the difference between the agent's local clock
   (available for example via hrSystemDate object from HOST-RESOURCES-
   MIB [RFC2790]) and the wall clock.

   Counters are not reset when a GBS is reinitialized, but rather only
   when the agent is reset or reinitialized.

   Note that the accumulation of certain performance events for a
   monitored entity is inhibited (counting stops) during periods of
   service unavailability on that monitored entity.  The DESCRIPTION
   clause of performance monitoring counters in this MIB module
   specifies which of the counters are inhibited during periods of
   service unavailability.

5.3.  Mapping of DSL Forum TR-159 Managed Objects

   This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects
   (attributes) defined in [TR-159] and managed objects defined in this
   document and in associated MIB modules, i.e., the IF-MIB [RFC2863].

7.  Security Considerations

   There is a number of managed objects defined in this MIB module with
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  Changing of gBondPortConfAdminScheme may lead to a potential
      locking of the link, if the peer device does not support desired
      bonding scheme.

   o  Changing of gBondPortConfDiscoveryCode, before the discovery
      operation, may lead to a wrongful discovery, for example when two
      CO ports are connected to the same multi-channel RT port, while
      both CO ports have the same discovery register value.

   o  Changing of target upstream/downstream data rate via
      gBondPortConfTargetUpDataRate/gBondPortConfTargetDnDataRate may
      lead to anything from link quality and rate degradation to a
      complete link initialization failure, as ability of a G.Bond port
      to support a particular configuration depends on the copper
      environment.

   o  Activation of a specific line/channel may cause a severe
      degradation of service for another G.Bond port, whose channel(s)
      may be affected by the cross-talk from the newly activated
      channel.

   o  Removal of a channel from an operationally 'up' G.Bond port,
      aggregating several channels, may cause port's rate degradation

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments since, collectively, they
   provide information about the performance of network interfaces and
   can reveal some aspects of their configuration.

   In particular, since a bonded xDSL port can be comprised of multiple
   Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) voice grade copper, located in the same
   bundle with other pairs belonging to another operator/customer, it is
   theoretically possible to eavesdrop to a G.Bond transmission, simply
   by "listening" to a cross-talk from the bonded pairs, especially if

   the operating parameters of the G.Bond link in question are known.

   It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to
   these objects and possibly even encrypt the values of these objects
   when sending them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables
   and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  gBondPortStatTable - objects in this table provide status
      information for the G.Bond port, which may aid in identification
      of the pairs belonging to the bonded port and eavesdroping to the
      traffic over that port.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), including full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   Three new values of IANAifType: g9981(263), g9982(264) and g9983(265)
   have been allocated by IANA [1] in the IANAifType-MIB module
   [IANAifType-MIB].

   An object identifier for gBondMIB MODULE-IDENTITY SHALL be allocated
   by IANA in the MIB-2 transmission sub-tree, before this document is
   published.
