Internet-Draft      Priority in PSC Linear Protection      February 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document contains the modifications to the priorities of inputs
   in [RFC6378], "MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection" in
   an effort to satisfy the ITU-T's protection switching requirements
   and correcting the problems that have been identified.

   In this document, the priorities of FS and SF-P are swapped and the
   priority of Clear SF is raised.  The reasons for these changes are
   explained in the following sub-sections from technical and network
   operational aspects.

1.1.  Motivations for swapping priorities of FS and SF-P

   Defining the priority of FS higher than that of SF-P can result in a
   situation where the protected traffic is taken out-of-service.
   Setting the priority of any input that is supposed to be signaled to
   the other end to be higher than that of SF-P can result in
   unpredictable protection switching state, when the protection path
   has failed and consequently the PSC communication stopped.  An
   example of the out-of-service scenarios is shown in Annex 1 of the
   ITU's liaison statement "Liaison Statement: Recommendation ITU-T
   G.8131/Y.1382 revision - Linear protection switching for MPLS-TP
   networks" [LIAISON1205].

   According to Section 2.4 of [RFC5654] it MUST be possible to operate
   an MPLS-TP network without using a control plane.  This means that
   external switch commands, e.g.  FS, can be transferred to the far end
   only by using the PSC and should not rely on the presence of a
   control plane.

   As the priority of SF-P has been higher than FS in optical transport
   networks and Ethernet transport networks, for network operators it is
   important that the MPLS-TP protection switching preserves the network
   operation behaviour to which network operators have become
   accustomed.  Typically, the FS command is issued before network
   maintenance jobs, replacing optical cables or other network
   components.  When an operator pulls out a cable on the protection
   path by mistake, the traffic should be protected and the operator
   expects this behaviour based on his/her experience on the traditional
   transport network operations.

   In the case that network operators need an option to control their
   networks so that the traffic can be placed on the protection path
   even when the PSC communication channel is broken, an end-to-end
   command should not be an option.  Changing the priority of inputs by
   provisioning adds complexity and the possibility for mis-
   configuration.  This is unacceptable for transport network operators.

   Instead of using FS, the Freeze command, which is a local command and
   not signaled to the other end, can be used.  The use of the Freeze
   command is described in Appendix A.

1.2.  Motivation for raising the priority of Clear SF

   The technical issue with the priority of Clear SF defined in
   [RFC6378] is shown in Appendix IV of [LIAISON1234].


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Acronyms

   This draft uses the following acronyms:

   FS      Forced Switch
   MPLS-TP Transport Profile for MPLS
   SF      Signal Fail
   SFc     Clear Signal Fail


4.  Updates to the PSC RFC

   This section describes the changes required to modify the priorities
   of FS, SF-P and Clear SF in the PSC protocol defined in [RFC6378]

4.1.  Updates to Section 4.3.2. Priority of Inputs

   The list of local requests in order of priority should be modified as
   follows:

   3   Clear Signal Fail/Degrade (OAM / control-plane / server
       indication)

   4   Signal Fail on protection (OAM / control-plane / server
       indication)

   5   Forced Switch (operator command)

Internet-Draft      Priority in PSC Linear Protection      February 2013


   6   Signal Fail on working (OAM / control-plane / server indication)

   7   Signal Degrade on working (OAM / control-plane / server
       indication)

4.2.  Updates to Section 4.3.3.2. Unavailable State

   Remove the following bullet items and their text:

   o  A local Forced Switch SHALL be ignored by the PSC Control logic
      when in Unavailable state as a result of a (local or remote)
      Lockout of protection.  If in Unavailable state due to an SF on
      protection, then the FS SHALL cause the LER to go into local
      Protecting administrative state and begin transmitting an FS(1,1)
      message.  It should be noted that due to the unavailability of the
      protection path (i.e., due to the SF condition) that this FS may
      not be received by the far-end until the SF condition is cleared.

   o  A remote Forced Switch message SHALL be ignored by the PSC Control
      logic when in Unavailable state as a result of a (local or remote)
      Lockout of protection.  If in Unavailable state due to a local or
      remote SF on protection, then the FS SHALL cause the LER to go
      into remote Protecting administrative state; if in Unavailable
      state due to local SF, begin transmitting an SF(0,1) message.

4.3.  Updates to Section 4.3.3.3. Protecting Administrative State

   Remove the following text in the first paragraph:

      The difference between a local FS and local MS affects what local
      indicators may be received -- the Local Request logic will block
      any local SF when under the influence of a local FS, whereas the
      SF would override a local MS.

   Replace the following bullet item text:

   o  A local Signal Fail indication on the protection path SHALL cause
      the LER to go into local Unavailable state and begin transmission
      of an SF(0,0) message, if the current state is due to a (local or
      remote) Manual Switch operator command.  If the LER is in (local
      or remote) Protecting administrative state due to an FS situation,
      then the SF on protection SHALL be ignored.

   With:

   o  A local Signal Fail indication on the protection path SHALL cause
      the LER to go into local Unavailable state and begin transmission
      of an SF(0,0) message.

Internet-Draft      Priority in PSC Linear Protection      February 2013


   Replace the following bullet item text:

   o  A remote Signal Fail message indicating a failure on the
      protection path SHALL cause the LER to go into remote Unavailable
      state and begin transmitting an NR(0,0) message, if the Protecting
      administrative state is due to a Manual Switch command.  It should
      be noted that this automatically cancels the current Manual Switch
      command and data traffic is reverted to the working path.

   With:

   o  A remote Signal Fail message indicating a failure on the
      protection path SHALL cause the LER to go into remote Unavailable
      state and begin transmitting an NR(0,0) message.  It should be
      noted that this automatically cancels the current Forced Switch or
      Manual Switch command and data traffic is reverted to the working
      path.

4.4.  Updates to Appendix A. PSC State Machine Tables

   Modify the state machine as follows (only modified cells are shown):

Appendix A.  Freeze Command

   The "Freeze" command applies only to the near end (local node) of the
   protection group and is not signaled to the far end.  This command
   freezes the state of the protection group.  Until the Freeze is
   cleared, additional near end commands are rejected and condition
   changes and received PSC information are ignored.

   "Clear Freeze" command clears the local freeze.  When the Freeze
   command is cleared, the state of the protection group is recomputed
   based on the persistent condition of the local triggers.

   Because the freeze is local, if the freeze is issued at one end only,
   a failure of protocol can occur as the other end is open to accept
   any operator command or a fault condition.
