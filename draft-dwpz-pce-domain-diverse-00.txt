                    PCE support for Domain Diversity
                    draft-dwpz-pce-domain-diverse-00

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) may be used for computing path for
   services that traverse multi-area and multi-AS Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered (TE)
   networks.

   Path computation should facilitate the selection of paths with domain
   diversity.  This document examines the existing mechanisms to do so
   and further propose some extensions to Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP).

1.  Introduction

   The ability to compute shortest constrained TE LSPs in Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across
   multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement.  In this
   context, a domain is a collection of network elements within a common
   sphere of address management or path computational responsibility
   such as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an Autonomous
   Systems (AS).

Internet-Draft               DOMAIN-DIVERSE               September 2013


   In a multi-domain environment, Domain Diversity is defined in
   [RFC6805].  A pair of paths are domain-diverse if they do not
   traverse any of the same transit domains.  Domain diversity may be
   maximized for a pair of paths by selecting paths that have the
   smallest number of shared domains.  Path computation should
   facilitate the selection of domain diverse paths as a way to reduce
   the risk of shared failure and automatically helps to ensure path
   diversity for most of the route of a pair of LSPs.

   This document examine a way to achieve domain diversity with existing
   inter-domain path computation mechanism like per-domain path
   computation technique [RFC5152], Backward Recursive Path Computation
   (BRPC) mechanism [RFC5441] and Hierarchical PCE [RFC6805].  This
   document also considers synchronized dependent path computations as
   well as non-synchronized path computation.  Since independent and
   synchronized path computation cannot be used to apply diversity, it
   is not discussed in this document.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The terminology is as per [RFC5440].

3.  Domain Diversity

   As described in [RFC6805], a set of paths are considered to be domain
   diverse if they do not share any transit domains, apart from ingress
   and egress domains.

   Some additional parameters to consider would be -

   Minimize shared domain:  When a fully domain diverse path is not
      possible, PCE could be requested to minimize the number of shared
      transit domains.  This can also be termed as maximizing partial
      domain diversity.

   Boundary Nodes:  TBD

Internet-Draft               DOMAIN-DIVERSE               September 2013


3.1.  Per Domain Path Computation

   The per domain path computation technique [RFC5152] defines a method
   where the path is computed during the signaling process (on a per-
   domain basis).  The entry Boundary Node (BN) of each domain is
   responsible for performing the path computation for the section of
   the LSP that crosses the domain, or for requesting that a PCE for
   that domain computes that piece of the path.

   Non-Synchronized Path Computation:  Path computations are performed
      in a serialized and independent fashion.  After the setup of
      primary path, a domain diverse path can be signaled by encoding
      the transit domain identifiers in XRO or EXRS using domain sub-
      objects defined in [DOMAIN-SUBOBJ] and [RFC3209] in RSVP-TE.  Note
      that the head end LSR should be aware of transit domain
      identifiers of the primary path to be able to do so.

   Synchronized Path Computation:  Not Applicable.

3.2.  Backward-Recursive PCE-based Computation

   The BRPC [RFC5441] technique involves cooperation and communication
   between PCEs in order to compute an optimal end-to-end path across
   multiple domains.  The sequence of domains to be traversed maybe
   known before the path computation, but it can also be used when the
   domain path is unknown and determined during path computation.

   Non-Synchronized Path Computation:  Path computations are performed
      in a serialized and independent fashion.  After the path
      computation and setup of primary path, a domain diverse path
      computation request is sent by PCC to the PCE, by encoding the
      transit domain identifiers in XRO or EXRS using domain sub-objects
      defined in [PCE-DOMAIN] and [RFC3209] in PCEP.  Note that the PCC
      should be aware of transit domain identifiers of the primary path
      to be able to do so.

   Synchronized Path Computation:  Not Applicable.  [Since different
      transit domain PCEs are involved , there is no way to achieve
      synchronization for domain diverse paths].  BTW [RFC5440]
      describes other diversity parameters (node, link etc).

3.3.  Hierarchical PCE

   In H-PCE [RFC6805] architecture, the parent PCE is used to compute a
   multi-domain path based on the domain connectivity information.  The
   parent PCE may be requested to provide a end to end path or only the
   sequence of domains.

3.3.1.  End to End Path

   Non-Synchronized Path Computation:  Path computations are performed
      in a serialized and independent fashion.  After the path
      computation and setup of primary path, a domain diverse path
      computation request is sent to the parent PCE, by encoding the
      transit domain identifiers in XRO or EXRS using domain sub-objects
      defined in [PCE-DOMAIN] and [RFC3209] in PCEP.  Note that the PCC
      should be aware of transit domain identifiers of the primary path
      to be able to do so.  The parent PCE should provide a domain
      diverse end to end path.

   Synchronized Path Computation:  Child PCE should be able to request
      dependent and synchronized domain diverse end to end paths from
      its parent PCE.  A new flag is added in SVEC object for this
      (Refer Section 4.1).

3.3.2.  Domain-Sequence

   Non-Synchronized Path Computation:  Path computations are performed
      in a serialized and independent fashion.  After the primary path
      computation using H-PCE (involving domain-sequence selection by
      parent PCE and end-to-end path computation via BRPC or Per-Domain
      mechanisms) and setup, a domain diverse path computation request
      is sent to the parent PCE, by encoding the transit domain
      identifiers in XRO or EXRS using domain sub-objects defined in
      [PCE-DOMAIN] and [RFC3209] in PCEP.  Note that the PCC should be
      aware of transit domain identifiers of the primary path to be able
      to do so.  The parent PCE should provide a diverse domain
      sequence.

   Synchronized Path Computation:  Child PCE should be able to request
      dependent and synchronized diverse domain-sequence(s) from its
      parent PCE.  A new flag is added in SVEC object for this (Refer
      Section 4.1).  The parent PCE should reply with diverse domain
      sequence(s) encoded in ERO as described in [PCE-DOMAIN].

4.  Extension to PCEP

4.1.  SVEC Object

   [RFC5440] defines SVEC object which includes flags for the potential
   dependency between the set of path computation requests (Link, Node
   and SRLG diverse).  This document proposes a new flag O for domain
   diversity.

   The format of the SVEC object body is as follows:

                     Figure 1: SVEC Body Object Format

   Following new bit is added in the Flags field:

   * O (Domain diverse) bit:  when set, this indicates that the computed
      paths corresponding to the requests specified by the following RP
      objects MUST NOT have any transit domain(s) in common.

   The Domain Diverse O-bit can be used in Hierarchical PCE path
   computation to compute synchronized domain diverse end to end path or
   diverse domain sequences as described in Section 3.3.

   When domain diverse O bit is set, it is applied to the transit
   domains.  The other bit in SVEC object (N, L etc) is set, should
   still be applied in the ingress and egress domain.

4.2.  Transit Domain Identifier

   In case of non-synchronized path computation, Ingress node (i.e. a
   PCC) should be aware of transit domain identifiers of the primary
   path.  So during the path computation or signaling of the primary
   path, the transit domain should be identified.

   A possible solution for path computation could be a flag in RP object
   requesting domain identifier to be returned in the PCEP path reply
   message.  Further details - TBD

4.3.  Minimize Shared Domains

   A new Objective function (OF) [RFC5541] code for synchronized path
   computation requests is proposed:

   MCTD

   *  Name:  Minimize the number of Common Transit Domains.

   *  Objective Function Code:  TBD

Internet-Draft               DOMAIN-DIVERSE               September 2013


   *  Description:  Find a set of paths such that it passes through the
      least number of common transit domains.

   The MCTD OF can be used in Hierarchical PCE path computation to
   request synchronized domain diverse end to end paths or diverse
   domain sequences as described in Section 3.3.

   For non synchronized diverse domain path computation the X bit in XRO
   or EXRS [RFC5521] sub-objects can be used, where X bit set as 1
   indicates that the domain specified SHOULD be excluded from the path
   computed by the PCE, but MAY be included subject to PCE policy and
   the absence of a viable path that meets the other constraints and
   excludes the domain.
