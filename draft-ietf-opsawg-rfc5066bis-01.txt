Abstract

   This document defines Management Information Base (MIB) module for
   use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   This document defines a set of objects, describing cross-connect
   capability of a managed device with multi-layer (stacked) interfaces,
   extending the stack management objects in the Interfaces Group MIB
   and the Inverted Stack Table MIB modules.  This document obsoletes
   RFC 5066.  It amends that specification by taking out the entire EFM-
   CU-MIB module along with the relevant descriptive text.  That MIB
   module will be part of a separate document, maintained by the
   Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.3
   working group.

Internet-Draft              If Stack Cap MIB                January 2013


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use
   with network management protocols in the Internet community,
   describing the cross-connect capability of a stacked interface.

   2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS physical interfaces, defined in the IEEE
   Standard 802.3 [802.3], as well the xDSL Multi-Pair Bonded interfaces
   defined in ITU-T recommendations G.998.1 [G.998.1], G.998.2 [G.998.2]
   and G.998.3 [G.998.3] are prime examples of the stacked interfaces,
   which MAY require the management information about the cross-connect
   capability.

   The previous version of this document, RFC 5066 [RFC5066], defined
   EFM-CU-MIB module along with the relevant descriptive text.  This
   version removes the entire EFM-CU-MIB module along with the relevant
   descriptive text.  That MIB module will be part of a separate
   document, maintained by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
   Engineers (IEEE) 802.3 working group.  In addition the Security
   Considerations section was updated to conform to the latest
   recommended boilerplate text, along with the relevant references.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB
   modules that are compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC
   2580 [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Relation to Other MIB Modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the Ethernet in the First Mile Copper (EFMCu)
   Interfaces MIB (EFM-CU-MIB) and the Interfaces Group MIB (IF-MIB)

Internet-Draft              If Stack Cap MIB                January 2013


   module are discussed.

3.1.  Relation to the EFMCu Interfaces MIB Module

   The EFM-CU-MIB module defined in [RFC5066], along with the relevant
   descriptive text, is now moved to a separate, IEEE maintained
   document, IEEE Std 802.3.1-2011 [802.3.1], which also renamed the
   EFM-CU-MIB to IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB.

3.2.  Relation to Interfaces Group MIB Module

   Stacked (a.k.a. aggregated or bonded) interfaces are managed using
   generic interface management objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].

   The stack management (i.e., actual connection of the sub-layers to
   the top-layer interface) is done via the ifStackTable, as defined in
   the IF-MIB [RFC2863], and its inverse ifInvStackTable, as defined in
   the IF-INVERTED-STACK-MIB [RFC2864].

   The new tables ifCapStackTable and its inverse ifInvCapStackTable
   defined in the IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module below, extend the stack
   management with an ability to describe possible connections or cross-
   connect capability, when a flexible cross-connect matrix is present
   between the interface layers.

3.2.1.  ifCapStackTable usage example for bonded xDSL interfaces

   An bonded xDSL interface, for example IEEE 2BASE-TL or 10PASS-TS or
   ITU-T G.998.2 interface, can aggregate or bond a number of individual
   xDSL interfaces, referred to as Physical Medium Entity (PME) sub-
   layer devices in IEEE 802.3 or Bonding Channel Entity (BCE) in ITU-T
   G.998.

   A generic bonded xDSL multiport device can have a number of bonded
   xDSL interfaces, referred to as Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS) in
   IEEE 802.3 or Generic Bonding Sublayer (GBS) in ITU-T G.998, cross-
   connected, via a configurable cross-connect fabric, to a number of
   underlying PMEs/BCEs, with a single PCS/GBS per PME/GBE relationship.

   The ifStackTable is indexed by the ifIndex values of the bonded PCS/
   GBS interface and the PMEs/BCEs connected to it.  The ifStackTable
   allows a Network Management application to determine which PMEs/BCEs
   are connected to a particular PCS/GBS and change connections (if
   supported by the application).  The ifInvStackTable, being an
   inverted version of the ifStackTable, provides an efficient means for
   a Network Management application to read a subset of the ifStackTable
   and thereby determine which PCS/GBS runs on top of a particular PME/
   GBE.

Internet-Draft              If Stack Cap MIB                January 2013


   A new table ifCapStackTable, defined in the IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module,
   specifies for each higher-layer interface (e.g., PCS/GBS port) a list
   of lower-layer interfaces (e.g., PMEs/BCEs), which can possibly be
   cross-connected to that higher-layer interface, determined by the
   cross-connect capability of the device.  This table, modeled after
   ifStackTable, is read-only, reflecting current cross-connect
   capability of stacked interface, which can be dynamic in some
   implementations (e.g., if PMEs/BCEs are located on a pluggable module
   and the module is pulled out).  Note that PME/BCE availability per
   PCS/GBS, described by ifCapStackTable, can be constrained by other
   parameters, for example, by aggregation capacity of a PCS/GBS or by
   the PME/BCE in question being already connected to another PCS/GBS.
   So, in order to ensure that a particular PME/BCE can be connected to
   the PCS/GBS, all objects related to interface stacking (e.g., the
   objects in ifCapStackTable and ifStackTable) SHALL be inspected.

   The ifInvCapStackTable, also defined in the IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module,
   describes which higher-layer interfaces (e.g., PCS/GPS) can possibly
   be connected to a particular lower-layer interface (e.g., PME/BCE),
   providing an inverted mapping of the ifCapStackTable.  While it
   contains no additional information beyond that already contained in
   the ifCapStackTable, the ifInvCapStackTable has the ifIndex values in
   its INDEX clause in the reverse order, i.e., the lower-layer
   interface first, and the higher-layer interface second, providing an
   efficient means for a Network Management application to read a subset
   of the ifCapStackTable and thereby determine which interfaces can be
   connected to run on top of a particular interface.

4.  MIB Structure

4.1.  Interface Stack Capability MIB Overview

   The IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module contains 2 tables:

   o  ifCapStackTable - containing objects that define possible
      relationships among the sub-layers of an interface with flexible
      cross-connect (cross-connect capability).

   o  ifInvCapStackTable - an inverse of the ifCapstackTable.

5.  Interface Stack Capability MIB Definitions

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863], and IF-
   INVERTED-STACK-MIB [RFC2864].

   Additionally, this MIB module makes reference to [RFC4181].

          sub-layers MAY run 'underneath' which other sub-layers, where
          each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.
          For example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x MAY be
          connected to run underneath the sub-layer with ifIndex value
          y, then this table contains:

             ifInvCapStackStatus.x.y=true

          This table contains exactly the same number of rows as the
          ifCapStackTable, but the rows appear in a different order.

          This table is read-only as it describes a cross-connect
          capability."

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no managed objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments since they can reveal some
   configuration aspects of the network interfaces.

   In particular, ifCapStackStatus and ifInvCapStackStatus can identify
   cross-connect capability of multi-layer (stacked) network interfaces,
   potentially revealing the underlying hardware architecture of the
   managed device.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), including full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   No action is required from IANA as the OID for ifCapStackMIB MODULE-
   IDENTITY was already allocated in [RFC5066].
