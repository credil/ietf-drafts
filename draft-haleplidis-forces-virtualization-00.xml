      <t> Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an
      architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize
      information exchange between the control plane and the forwarding
      plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES NE).  RFC5812 has defined
      the ForCES Model provides a formal way to represent the capabilities, 
      state, and configuration of forwarding elements within the context of 
      the ForCES protocol, so that control elements (CEs) can control the FEs 
      accordingly. More specifically, the model describes the logical functions 
      that are present in an FE, what capabilities these functions support, and 
      how these functions are or can be interconnected.</t>
      <t>The ForCES model provides the necessary abstractions to natively support 
      virtualization of the forwarding plane. This documents describes a formal approach
      to model the necessary parameters required for defining and managing virtual network 
      forwarding planes to create virtual network elements.</t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
  <section title="Definitions">
	<t> This document follows the terminology defined by the ForCES
   Model in <xref target="RFC5812"></xref>.
   The required definitions are repeated below for clarity.</t>
  
      <t><list style="hanging">
      
<t>FE Model - The FE model is designed to model the logical processing
functions of an FE. The FE model proposed in this document
includes three components; the LFB modeling of individual Logical
Functional Block (LFB model), the logical interconnection between
LFBs (LFB topology), and the FE-level attributes, including FE
capabilities. The FE model provides the basis to define the
information elements exchanged between the CE and the FE in the
ForCES protocol [RFC5810].</t>
<t>LFB (Logical Functional Block) Class (or type) - A template that
represents a fine-grained, logically separable aspect of FE
processing. Most LFBs relate to packet processing in the data
path. LFB classes are the basic building blocks of the FE model.</t>
<t>LFB Instance - As a packet flows through an FE along a data path, it
flows through one or multiple LFB instances, where each LFB is an
instance of a specific LFB class. Multiple instances of the same
LFB class can be present in an FE's data path. Note that we often
refer to LFBs without distinguishing between an LFB class and LFB
instance when we believe the implied reference is obvious for the
given context.</t>
<t>LFB Model - The LFB model describes the content and structures in an
LFB, plus the associated data definition. XML is used to provide
a formal definition of the necessary structures for the modeling.
Four types of information are defined in the LFB model. The core
part of the LFB model is the LFB class definitions; the other
three types of information define constructs associated with and
used by the class definition. These are reusable data types,
supported frame (packet) formats, and metadata.</t>
<t>Element - Element is generally used in this document in accordance
with the XML usage of the term. It refers to an XML tagged part
of an XML document. For a precise definition, please see the full
set of XML specifications from the W3C. This term is included in
this list for completeness because the ForCES formal model uses
XML.</t>
<t>Attribute - Attribute is used in the ForCES formal modeling in
accordance with standard XML usage of the term, i.e., to provide
attribute information included in an XML tag.</t>
<t>LFB Metadata - Metadata is used to communicate per-packet state from
one LFB to another, but is not sent across the network. The FE
model defines how such metadata is identified, produced, and
consumed by the LFBs, but not how the per-packet state is
implemented within actual hardware. Metadata is sent between the
FE and the CE on redirect packets.</t>
<t>ForCES Component - A ForCES Component is a well-defined, uniquely
identifiable and addressable ForCES model building block. A
component has a 32-bit ID, name, type, and an optional synopsis
description. These are often referred to simply as components.
LFB Component - An LFB component is a ForCES component that defines
the Operational parameters of the LFBs that must be visible to the
CEs.</t>
<t>LFB Class Library - The LFB class library is a set of LFB classes
that has been identified as the most common functions found in
most FEs and hence should be defined first by the ForCES Working
Group.</t>

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>Forwarding plane virtualization is one key ingerdient in creating a fully virtualized environment for data centers. One of the main requirements for virtualizing the forwarding plane is to create a complete set of abstractions that can be mapped to the physical devices. The <xref target="RFC5812">ForCES Model</xref> is such and abstraction as it presents a formal way to describe the Forwarding Plane's datapath with Logical Function Blocks (LFBs) using XML. This documents describes a formal approach to model the necessary parameters required for defining and managing a virtual network forwarding plane. Control Elements virtual or physical can be associated with ForCES protocol to the virtual FEs and create a virtual network element.</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Virtualization">
    <t>LFBs are abstraction of the forwarding plane therefore they can be also used as abstractions of the virtual forwarding plane as well.</t>
    <t>There are at least two model approaches to virtualize the forwarding plane for devices that have defined and publish their own LFBs using ForCES to provide isolation between different virtual FEs. These two model approaches can also be used in a joint approach</t>
    <t><list style="numbers">
      <t>Create disctinct and isolated topologies of LFB instances inside an FE and assign them as one virtual FE as seen in <xref target="LFBIsolation"></xref>.</t>
      <t>Since some LFBs provide common funcionality between virtual FEs, orovide isolation inside shared LFB instances where applicable, for example assign rows 1-10000 of EtherClassifier LFB to virtual FE 1 as seen in <xref target="TableIsolation"></xref></t>

      <t>This document focuses on the definition of an LFB that will allow a CE to deploy and manage virtual FEs. In this approach we try to define parameters of what is commonly called a hypervisor therefore treating it as an FE, in order to be managed by a virtual management software, in this case a CE.</t>
      <t>A network hypervisor in the ForCES model can be a joined Control Element Manager and a Forwarding Element Manager which defines which CEs or vCEs connect to which FEs or vFEs. What is required therefore of this document is a way to define resource allocation to a vFE. This document introduces a new LFB, called vFE which contains the following details for one tenant:</t>
      <t><list style="numbers">
        <t>TenantID</t>
        <t>FEs and resource allocation per FE.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
