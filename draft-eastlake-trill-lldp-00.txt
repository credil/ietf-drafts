          Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL)
           Support of the Link Layer Discover Protocol (LLDP)
                   <draft-eastlake-trill-lldp-00.txt>


Abstract

   The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP, IEEE Std 802.1AB) is a one-
   way, unacknowledged protocol for the announcement of a station's
   capabilities to its peers.  The set of peers that receive these
   frames and the scoping of the frame, such as whether or not it
   traverses certain types of bridges, is primarily determined by the
   destination MAC address of the LLDP frame.  This document specifies
   TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) support of LLDP
   and updates RFC 6325.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                        TRILL LLDP Support


1. Introduction

   The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP, IEEE [802.1AB]) is a one-
   way, unacknowledged protocol for the announcement of a station's
   capabilities to its peers.  The set of peers that receive these
   frames and the scoping of the frame, such as whether or not it
   traverses certain types of bridges, is primarily determined by the
   destination MAC address of the LLDP frame.  This document specifies
   TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links, [RFC6325]
   [RFC6327]) support of LLDP.  Such support is optional. This document
   updates [RFC6325]

   Clause 7.1 of the IEEE [802.1AB] Standard explicitly states that LLDP
   may be used with any unicast or group (multi-destination) address.
   This document specifies the use of LLDP with the Nearest-RBridge MAC
   destination address.



1.1 Terminology and Acronyms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following are used in this document:

      IEEE - Institute for Electronic and Electrical Engineers
             (www.ieee.org)

      LLDP - Link Layer Discovery Protocol [802.1AB]

      LLDPDU - LLDP Data Unit

      MAC - Media Access Control

      RBridge - Routing Bridge [RFC6325]

      TPMR - Two Port MAC Relay [802.1Q]

      TRILL - Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links [RFC6325]

2. LLDP on RBridge Ports

   IEEE LLDP [802.1AB] explicitly specifies that LLDP is usable with
   "Any group MAC address" and "Any individual MAC address" as the
   destination MAC address. That standard also documents specific
   destination MAC addresses with different scope for propagation across
   various bridge types specified by IEEE 802.1 such as:

   o  Nearest Bridge: Propagation stops at the nearest bridge of any
      type, including a Two-port MAC Relay (TPMR, [802.1Q]).

   o  Nearest Non-TPMR Bridge: Propagation stops at the nearest Customer
      or Provider Bridge, but not at a TPMR.

   o  Nearest Customer Bridge: Propagation stops at the nearest Customer
      Bridge; i.e. such frames would pass through Provider Bridges and
      TPMRs transparently.

   Note that the devices that stop the propagation of LLDP frames are
   the only devices that process them; other devices forward them as if
   they were regular data frames.

   A new Nearest-RBridge multicast MAC address (see Section 4) is used
   as a destination MAC address with LLDPUs to send them to neighbor
   RBridges. There may in the future be other uses of the Nearest-
   RBridge multicast MAC address; in such applications, the Ethertype of
   those frames would be different than the LLDP EtherType (0x88CC).



2.1 LLDP on RBridge Ethernet Ports

   LLDPDUs sent with the Nearest-RBridge multicast address out an
   RBridge Ethernet port are not encapsulated with a TRILL Header and
   are sent natively. Intervening bridges, if any, will be transparent
   to frames using this multicast address.

   LLDPDUs using the Nearest-RBridge MAC destination address may be
   transmitted as permitted by [802.1AB] by an RBridge on any of its
   Ethernet ports regardless of the state of any adjacencies [IS-IS]
   [RFC6327] on that port.

   LLDPDUs may also be sent on RBridge Ethernet ports with the IEEE
   802.1 provided destination MAC addresses listed above or other
   appropriate destination MAC addresses if other scopes are desired.

2.2 LLDP on Other RBridge Ports

   If an RBridge port is a port on which an LLDPDU cannot be transmitted
   in native form, for example, a PPP TRILL port [RFC6361], the Nearest-
   RBridge destination MAC multicast address is still used but the
   LLDPDU appears inside a TRILL Data frame as specified in Section 3.
   The payload EtherType is the LLDP EtherType (0x88CC) with the
   subsequent portion of the frame following normal LLDP rules. This
   technique can be used to send an LLDPDU out an RBridge port to any
   RBridges that are one hop away regardless of the data-link technology
   of the port.

   To assure than any required link initialization has occurred, TRILL
   Data frames containing LLDPDUs MUST NOT be transmitted out an RBridge
   port unless there is at least one adjacency [IS-IS] [RFC6327] on that
   port in a state other than Down. Otherwise, the rate of transmission
   of such frames is governed by the same rules as native LLDPDUs
   [802.1AB].

   An LLDPDU received in a TRILL Data frame must pass the tests in
   Section 3.2 before being acted on.

3. Nearest-RBridge as Inner.MacDA

   The Nearest-RBridge multicast MAC address is never forwarded by an
   Rbridge, and as a result the scope of a frame with this address as
   the MAC DA would be all immediately adjacent RBridge neighbors on a
   link. The following sub-sections specify TRILL Data frame
   transmission and receipt where the Inner.MacDA is Nearest-RBridge.



3.1 Transmission

   When the Inner.MacDA of a TRILL Data frame is the Nearest-RBridge
   multicast MAC, then the following apply. Different uses of this MAC
   address are distinguished by the payload EtherType, for example
   0x88CC for LLDP.

   1. The originating RBridge MUST set the Inner.MacSA to a MAC address
      unique within the campus owned by that originating RBridge. This
      MAY be the same Inner.MacSA used for ESADI [RFC6325] and/or
      RBridge Channel [Channel] frames.

   2. The Inner.VLAN defaults to 0x001 and is ignored on receipt unless
      otherwise specified for the particular use.

   3. TRILL Header fields MUST be set as follows:

      3.a the hop count is initialized to the maximum value (0x3F),

      3.b the M bit is set to zero,

      3.c the ingress nickname is a nickname owned by the originating
          RBridge,

      3.d the egress nickname is set to Any-RBridge. RBridges supporting
          the Nearest-RBridge MAC address MUST recognize the Any-RBridge
          egress nickname.

   4. The link header/trailer are set as for a multi-destination TRILL
      Data frame.



3.2 Receipt

   When a TRILL Data frame with an Inner.MacDA of Nearest-RBridge is
   egressed at an RBridge, it MUST be discarded unless it passes the
   following TRILL Header tests:

   1. The M bit is zero and the egress nickname is Any-RBridge.

   2. The hop count confirms that it came from an immediate neighbor
      [RFC5082].

   If not discarded, it is assumed to be directed to the egress RBridge
   itself and is handled as appropriate for the payload protocol.

4. Change in RFC 6325

   A change in the behavior mandated by [RFC6325] is required to support
   the optional features in this document, as follows:

      An RBridge conformant to [RFC6325] will discard an Ethernet frame
      that it receives whose Outer MAC destination address is the
      Nearest-RBridge multicast address. To support LLDP to that address
      as described in Section 2.1 above, and RBridge must accept such
      frames and process them appropriately depending on their protocol
      type if the RBridge implements that protocol. For example, if the
      EtherType is the LLDP EtherType and LLDP is implemented at the
      receiving RBridge, it would be processed as an LLDPDU.




5. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new TRILL multicast address
   [01-80-C2-00-00-44 suggested] for use as the Nearest-RBridge address
   and add this to the TRILL Multicast Addresses sub-registry.




6. Security Considerations

   This document specifies how to send LLDPDUs between adjacent
   RBridges. These techniques increase the span of the "link" over which
   LLDP operates. This increased span may require use of additional
   security measures depending on the uses to which LLDP is put.  If
   sensitive information is being transported, then appropriate link
   security should be used, depending on the link type, such as IEEE
   [802.1AE] for Ethernet links.

   Should an RBridge that does not understand the Any-RBridge egress
   nickname accept a frame with Outer.MacDA of All-RBridges but with the
   M bit zero in the TRILL Header it will simply discard the frame as
   having a reserved egress nickname value.
