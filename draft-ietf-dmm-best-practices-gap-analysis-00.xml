This document discusses how to best deploy
the current IP mobility protocols
in distributed mobility management (DMM) scenarios
and analyzes the gaps of such best current practices 
against the DMM requirements.
These best current practices are achieved
by redistributing the existing MIPv6 and PMIPv6 functions
in the DMM scenarios.
The analyses is also applied to the real world deployment of IP mobility
in WiFi network and in cellular network.

<!-- Introduction -->

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>
The distributed mobility management (DMM) WG has studied the problems 
of centralized deployment of mobility management protocols
and the requirements of DMM
[ID-dmm-requirements].
In order to guide the deployment
and before defining any new DMM protocol,
the DMM WG is chartered to investigate first
whether it is feasible to deploy current IP mobility protocols
in DMM scenario in a way that can meet the requirements of DMM.
This document discusses 
how to best deploy existing mobility protocols in DMM scenarios 
to solve the problems of centralized deployment.
It then analyzes the gaps of such best practices 
against the DMM requirements. 
</t>

<t>
The rest of this document is organized as follows:
</t>

<t>
Section 3 analyzes the current IP mobility protocols
by examining their existing functions
and how these functions can be reconfigured 
to achieve the best practices in DMM scenarios.
Section 4 presents the current practices of WiFi network and 3GPP network.
With WiFi, a DMM scenario is the flattened WiFi network.
After presenting the fundaments what one can do to achieve distribution,
the existing mobility management functions are reconfigured in the flattened networks
for both network- and host-based mobility protocols
using these fundaments as guiding priciples.
The current practices in 3GPP are also described,
and the DMM scenarios are LIPA and SIPTO.
Section 5 presents the gap analyses on the best practice
achieved by reconfiguring currently existing functions
in the DMM scenario
which applies to both those in the WiFi and the 3GPP networks.

<!-- 3 Mobility Management Logical Functions -->

<section title="Current IP mobility protocol analysis">

<!-- 3.1 Protocols and existing functions -->

<section title="IP mobility protocols and their mobility management functions">

<t>
The host-based Mobile IPv6
<xref target="RFC6275"/>
and its network-based extension,
PMIPv6
<xref target="RFC5213"/>,
are both a logically centralized mobility management approach
addressing primarily hierarchical mobile networks.
Although they are a centralized approach,
they have important mobility management functions
resulting from years of extensive work 
to develop and to extend these functions.
It is therefore fruitful to take these existing functions
and reconfigure them in a DMM scenario
in order to understand how to best deploy the
existing mobility protocols
in a distributed mobility management environment.
</t>

<t>
The existing mobility management functions 
of MIPv6, PMIPv6, and HMIPv6
are the following: 
</t>

<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>
Anchoring: allocation of home network prefix or HoA 
to an MN that registers with the network; 
<vspace blankLines="1" />
</t>
<t>
Mobility Routing (MR) function: 
packets interception and forwarding to/from the HoA of the MN, 
based on the internetwork location information, 
either to the destination 
or to some other network element 
that knows how to forward the packets to their destination;
<vspace blankLines="1" /> 
</t>
<t>
Internetwork Location Management (LM) function: 
managing and keeping track of the internetwork location of an MN,
which includes a mapping of the HoA 
to the mobility anchoring point that the MN is anchored to; 
<vspace blankLines="1" />
</t>

<t>
Location Update (LU): 
provisioning of MN location information to the LM function; 
<vspace blankLines="1" />
</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
Figure 1 shows Mobile IPv6 
<xref target="RFC6275"/>
and Proxy Mobile IPv6
<xref target="RFC5213"/>
with their existing mobility management functions.
In Network1, the combination of the functions 
MR, LM and HoA allocation in network1
is the home agent in MIPv6
and is the local mobility anchor in PMIPv6. 
In Network3, the AR32+LU combination together with additional signaling with MN comprises the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) in PMIPv6.
The mobile nodes MN11 and MN12 were originally attached to Network1
and were allocated the IP prefixes 
for their respective home addresses HoA11 and HoA12.
</t>
<t>
Using MIPv6, MN11 has moved to Network3,
from which it is allocated a new prefix to configure the IP address IP31. 
LM1 maintains the binding HoA11:IP31
so that packets from CN21 in Network2
destined to HoA11 will be intercepted by MR1,
which will then tunnel them to IP31.
MN11 must perform mobility signaling
using the LU function.
</t>
<t>
Using PMIPv6, MN12 has moved to Network3
and attached to the access router AR32
which has the IP address IP32 in Network3.
LM1 maintains the binding HoA12:IP32.
The access router AR32 also behaves like a home link to MN12
so that MN12 can use its original IP address HoA12.

Achieving the best practices 
by reconfiguring the existing functions in this manner

<!-- 4 DMM Functional Scenarios -->

<section title="Current practices of IP mobility protocols">

<t>
This section covers the practices
for distribution of IP mobility management. 
Basically, the scenario presents a way 
to distribute the logical mobility functions. 
Gap analysis will be made on these scenarios.
</t>

<!-- 4.1 Fundamentals of distribution -->

<section title="Fundamentals of distribution">

<t>
There are many possibilities 
to implement a distributed mobility management system 
and this document could not be exhaustive.
However, 
this document is supposed to focus 
on current mobility architectures 
and to reuse existing mobility protocol 
as much as possible; 
it thus allows fixing the main technical guidelines 
and assumptions for current practices. 
Then, 
gap analysis will analyze 
these basic solution guidelines 
with respect to the requirements 
from [ID.ietf.dmm.requirements] 
and pave the way for optimizations. 
Technical guidelines for DMM current practices 
are as follows: 
</t>

<t>
The technical assumptions or guidelines are:
<list style="numbers">
<t>
When mobility support is required, 
the system will select the mobility anchor 
closest to the MN.
</t>
<t>
This document focuses on mobility management 
realized by preservation of the IP address 
across the different points of attachment 
during the mobility. 
IP flows of applications 
which do not need constant IP address 
are not handled by DMM. 
It is typically the role of a connection manager 
to distinguish application capabilities 
and trigger the mobility support accordingly. 
Further considerations on application management 
are out of the scope of this document.
</t>
<t>
IP address preservation is ensured 
thanks to traffic redirection.
</t>
<t>
Mobility traffic redirection 
is limited within the access network, 
e.g., traffic redirection taking place 
between access routers. 
In this document, 
traffic redirection relies on 
Network based mobility management protocols 
like PMIP [RFC 5213] or GTP [TS 23.402].
Mobility management and traffic redirection 
come into play 
only when the MN moves from the point of attachment 
where the IP flow has been initiated; 
in case of mobility, 
this point of attachment becomes the anchoring point.
It implies that the MN could be managed 
by more the one anchor when more than one IP flow,
initiated within different points of attachment,
are running.
</t>
<t>
An access router will advertise anchored prefixes 
and a local prefix, 
i.e., a prefix topologically valid at the access router.
When being initiated, 
an IP communication must prefer 
the local prefix to the anchored prefix. 
Prefix management is realized 
with IPv6 prefix deprecation.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<!-- 4.2 Flattening the WiFi Network -->

<section title="Flattening the WiFi Network">

<t>
The most common Wi-Fi architectures are depicted on figure 3.
In some cases, 
these architectures can rely on Proxy Mobile IPv6, 
where the access aggregation gateway 
plays the role of LMA 
and the MAG is supported 
either by the Residential Gateway (RG), 
the WLAN Controller (WLC) or an Access Router (AR)  
[ID. gundavelli-v6ops-community-wifi-svcs].

<t>Figure 3. WiFi network architectures.
</t>

<t>
Because of network densification and distribution of content, 
it may be necessary 
to distribute the access aggregation gateway functions 
closer to the MN; 
see [ID.ietf-dmm-requirements] for motivation of network flattening. 
In an extreme distribution case, 
the access aggregation gateway functions, 
including the mobility management functions, 
may all be located at the AR 
as shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.
These two figures depict the network- and client-based 
distributed mobility management scenarios.
The AR is expected to support the HoA allocation function.
Then, depending on the mobility situation of the MN,
the AR can run different functions:
</t>

<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>
the AR can act as a legacy IP router; 
<vspace blankLines="1" />
</t>
<t>
the AR can provide the MR function 
(i.e. act as mobility anchor);
<vspace blankLines="1" /> 
</t>
<t>
the AR can provide the LU functions; 
<vspace blankLines="1" />
</t>
<t>
the AR can provide both MR and LU functions. 
<vspace blankLines="1" />
</t>
</list>

[I-D.seite-dmm-dma] and [I-D.bernardos-dmm-distributed-anchoring] are PMIPv6 based implementation of this scenario.

</t>
<t>
Initially, MN1 attaches to AR1, (1).
According to vanilla IPv6 operations, 
AR1 advertises a prefix (HoA1) to MN1
and then, AR1, acts as a legacy IP router.
Then, MN1 initiates a communication
with CN11 using an IP address formed from the prefix HoA1.
So, AR1 runs usual IP routing? 
and mobility management does not come into play.
</t>
<t>
In case (2), 
MN1 performs a handover from AR1 to AR3 
while maintaining ongoing IP communication with CN11. 
AR1 becomes the mobility anchor 
for the MN1-CN11 IP communication: 
AR1 runs MR and LM functions for MN1. 
AR3 performs LU up to the LM in AR1: 
AR3 indicates to AR1 the new location of the MN1. 
AR3 advertises both HoA1 and a new IP prefix (HoA3)
which is supposed to be used for new IP communication, 
e.g., if MN1 initiates IP communication with CN21. 
Prefix HoA1 is deprecated
as it is expected to be used only for communications
anchored to AR1.
AR3 shall act as a legacy IP router for MN1-CN21 communication,
i.e., mobility management does not come.
</t>
<t>
In case (3), 
MN1 performs a handover from AR1 to AR2 
with ongoing IP communication with CN11 and CN21. 
AR1 is the mobility anchor for the MN1-CN11 IP communication. 
AR3 becomes the mobility anchor for the MN1-CN21 IP communication. 
Both AR1 and AR3 run MR and LM functions for MN1, 
respectively, anchoring HoA1 and HoA3. 
AR2 performs location updates 
up to the LMs in AR1 and AR3 for respectively relocate HoA1 and HoA3.
AR2 advertises a new prefix (HoA2), 
expected to be used for new IP communications,
and deprecates HoA1 and HoA3 used by the anchored IP sessions.

<!-- 4.1.2 Client-based Mobility Management -->

<section title="Client-based Mobility Management">
<t>
Basic practices for distribution of client-based mobility management 
is depicted in Figure 5.
Here, client-based mobility management 
does not necessary implies Mobile IP because, 
according to distribution fundamentals (section 4.1), 
current practices rely on principles 
inherited from PMIP and traffic redirection 
takes place only between access routers. 
However, with client based mobility, 
the MN is authorized to send information 
on its ongoing mobility session; 
for example in order to facilitate localization update operations 
[I-D.seite-dmm-dma].  
</t>

<t>
In case (1), MN1 attaches to AR1. 
AR advertises the prefix HoA1 to MN1 then acts as a legacy IP router. 
MN1 initiates a communication with CN11.
</t>

<t>
In case (2), 
MN1 performs a handover from AR1 to AR3 
with ongoing IP communication with CN11. 
AR1 becomes the mobility anchor for the MN1-CN11 IP communication: 
AR1 runs MR and LM functions for MN1. 
The MN performs LU directly up to the LM in AR1 or via AR3; 
in this case AR3 acts as a proxy locator (pLU) 
(e.g. as a FA in MIPv4).
AR3 allocates a new IP prefix (HoA3) for new IP communications. 
HoA3 is supposed to be used for new IP communications, 
e.g., if MN1 initiates IP communication with CN21. 
AR3 shall act as a legacy IP router for MN1-CN21 communication.

Figure 6. 3GPP SAE architecture.
</t>

<t>
In SAE architecture, there are two types of non-3GPP access network: 
trusted and untrusted. 
Trusted non-3GPP access means 
that the non-3GPP access network has a trust relationship 
with the 3GPP operator. 
Untrusted means the operator considers the non-3GPP network as untrusted, 
the non-3GPP network may either be or not be deployed by the same operator.  
The mobility support within the 3GPP network 
mostly relies on s5/s8 interface 
which is based on GTP or PMIP. 
For the scenario which provide non-3GPP network and 3GPP network mobility, 
there are mainly three solutions that is using IP mobility protocol:
</t>
<t>
In 3GPP SAE architecture, there are three interfaces that use IP mobility protocol:
<list style="numbers">
<t>
S2a Interface: 
S2a is the interface 
between trusted non-3GPP access network and the EPC.
This interface could be based on GTP or PMIP. 
When using PMIP, the PDN gateway in the EPC will function as LMA. 
The mobile station will anchor at this LMA/PDN-Gateway entity. 
The mobile station will maintain the session continuity 
when handover between the non-3GPP access network and 3GPP network.
</t>
<t>
S2b Interface:
S2b is the interface 
between the trusted-non-3GPP access network and the PDN gateway. 
This interface is based on PMIP. 
The PDN-gateway functions as PMIP LMA. 
The mobile station will anchor at this LMA/PDN-Gateway entity. 
The ePDG in the EPC network will function as PMIP MAG. 
The mobile station will maintain the session continuity 
when handover between the non-3GPP access network and 3GPP network.
</t>
<t>
S2c Interface:
S2c is the interface between the mobile station and the EPC network. 
It can be used in both trusted and un-trusted 3GPP access network. 
S2c interface uses DSMIPv6 protocol which is specified by IETF. 
The PDN gateway functions as DSMIPv6 Home agent in this scenario. 
When using non-trusted-non-3GPP access network, 
the mobile station will first establish IPSec tunnel toward the ePDG, 
and runs DSMIPv6 inside this IPSec tunnel. 
The mobile station will maintain the session continuity 
when handover between the non-3GPP access network and 3GPP network.
</t>
</list>

<!-- 4.4.1 3GPP LIPA/SIPTO -->
<section title="3GPP LIPA/SIPTO">

<t>
Another scenario that uses IP mobility protocol in 3GPP currently 
is the LIPA/SIPTO scenario. 
LIPA stands for Local IP Access. 
The following figure shows the LIPA scenario.

<t>Figure 7. LIPA scenario.
</t>

<t>
The main feature of LIPA is that 
the mobile station can access a local IP network through H(e)NB. 
H(e)NB is a small, low-power cellular base station, 
typically designed for use in a home or enterprise. 
The mobile station can access the local network's service, 
for example, connect to a user home's TV, 
computers, picture libraries etc. 
The LIPA architecture is illustrated in Figure 8.

<t>Figure 8. LIPA architecture.
</t>

<t>
There is a local gateway function in the H(e)NB. 
The local gateway (L-GW) function acts as a GGSN (UMTS) or P-GW (LTE).
The mobile station uses a special APN 
to establish the PDP context or the default bearer towards the L-GW. 
</t>

<t>
One thing that needs to be noted 
is that in 3GPP Release 10, 
there is no mobility support 
when the mobile stations moves between H(e)NBs.
The bearer will be broken when the mobile moves among H(e)NBs. 
For example, when several H(e)NBs are deployed in an office, 
there is no mobility support 
when the mobile station needs to do handover between the H(e)NBs. 
The user session would be broken 
when a user moves from one H(e)NB coverage to another.
</t>

<t>
The SIPTO (Selected IP Traffic Offload) scenario 
is illustrated in the Figure 9. 
There is also a local gateway function near the base station. 
The traffic can be routed through the local gateway to offload the traffic.
</t>

<t>
In both LIPA and SIPTO architecture, the local gateway functions as the 
anchor point for the local traffic.
</t>

<!-- 4.3 Fully Distributed with Separation of Control and Data Planes -->

<section title="Fully distributed scenario with separation of control and data planes">

<t>
For either the WiFi network and cellular network such as 3GPP,
the DMM scenario can be a fully distributed scenario
separation of control and data planes. 
The reconfiguration of mobility management functions in these scenario
may consist of multiple MRs and a distributed LM database.
Figure 10 shows such an example DMM architecture 
with the same three networks as in Figure 3.
As is in Figure 3, 
each network in Figure 10 has its own IP prefix allocation function. 
In the data plane, 
the mobility routing function 
is distributed to multiple locations 
at the MRs so that routing can be optimized. 
In the control plane, 
the MRs may exchange signaling with each other.
In addition to these features in Figure 3, 
the LM function in Figure 10 is a distributed database, 
with multiple servers, 
of the mapping of HoA to CoA.

<t>Figure 10. A distributed architecture for mobility management.
</t>

<t>
To perform mobility routing, 
the MRs need the location information 
which is maintained at the LMs. 
The MRs are therefore the clients of the LM servers 
and may also send location updates to the LM 
as the MNs perform the handover. 
The location information 
may either be pulled from the LM servers by the MR, 
or pushed to the MR by the LM servers. 
In addition, 
the MR may also cache a limited amount of location information. 
</t>

<t>
This figure shows three MRs (MR1, MR2, and MR3) 
in three networks. 
MN11 has moved from the first network 
supported by MR1 and LM1 
to the third network supported by MR3 and LM3. 
It may use an HoA (HoA11) allocated to it 
when it was in the first network 
for those application sessions 
that had already started when MN11 was attached there 
and that require session continuity 
after the handover to the third network. 
When MN11 was in the first network, 
no location management is needed 
so that LM1 will not keep an entry of HoA11. 
After MN11 has performed its handover to the third network, 
the database server LM1 maintains a mapping of HoA11 to MR3. 
That is, 
LM1 points to the third network 
and it is the third network 
that will keep track of how to reach MN11. 
Such a hierarchical mapping 
can prevent frequent update signaling to LM1 
as MN11 performs intra-network handover
within the third network.
In other words, 
the concept of hierarchical mobile IP [RFC5380]
is applied here 
but only in location management 
and not in routing in the data plane.

"Gap analysis with reconfiguration MIPv6 and PMIPv6 functions in DMM scenario such as the flattened WiFi network">

<!-- 5.1.1 gap analysis with REQ4: existing protocols -->

<section title="Considering existing protocols first">
<t>
The fourth DMM requirement is on existing mobility protocols
[ID-dmm-requirements:
</t>

<t>
REQ4: A DMM solution SHOULD 
first consider reusing and extending 
IETF-standardized protocols 
before specifying new protocols.
</t>

<t>
The best current practice is using 
the existing mobility management functions of the current protocols. 
</t>

</section>

<!-- 5.1.2 gap analysis with REQ5-1: compatibility -->

<section title="Compatibility">
<t>
The first part of the fifth DMM requirement is on compatibility:
</t>

<t>
REQ5: (first part) The DMM solution MUST  
be able to co-exist 
with existing network deployments and end hosts.
For example,
depending on the environment in which DMM is deployed,
DMM solutions
may need to be compatible 
with other deployed mobility protocols
or may need to interoperate
with a network or mobile hosts/routers
that do not support DMM protocols.
</t>

<t>
Different deployments using the same abstract functions
are basically reconfiguration of these same functions
if their functions use common message formats
between these functions.
A design principle of the IPv6 message format 
accommodates the use of common message formats 
as it allows to define extension headers, 
e.g., use of mobility header and options.
It is shown in Section 4 that MIPv6, PMIPv6, 
HMIPv6, Distributing mobility anchors 
can be constructed from the abstract functions
by adding more features and additional messages
one on top of the other in the above order.
The later protocol will therefore support
the one from which the later is constructed
by adding more messages.
</t>
</section>

<!-- 5.1.3 gap analysis with REQ3: IPv6 deployment -->

<section title="IPv6 deployment">
<t>
The third DMM requirement on IPv6 deployment is the following.
</t>

<t>
REQ3: DMM solutions SHOULD target IPv6 
as the primary deployment environment
and SHOULD NOT be tailored specifically to support IPv4, 
in particular in situations 
where private IPv4 addresses and/or NATs are used.
</t>

<t>
This is not an issue when using the mobility management functions 
of MIPv6 and PMIPv6 which are originally designed for IPv6.
</t>
</section>

<!-- 5.1.4 gap analysis with REQ6: Security considerations -->

<section title="Security considerations">
<t>
The second part of the fourth requirement 
as well as the sixth DMM requirement
[ID-dmm-requirements] are as follows:
</t>

<t>
REQ5 (second part): 
Furthermore,
a DMM solution SHOULD work across different networks,
possibly operated as separate administrative domains, 
when allowed by the trust relationship
between them. 
</t>

<t>
REQ6: DMM protocol solutions 
MUST consider security aspects,
including confidentiality and integrity. 
Examples of aspects to be considered are
authentication and authorization mechanisms 
that allow a legitimate mobile host/router 
to use the mobility support provided by the DMM solution; 
signaling message protection
in terms of authentication, 
encryption, etc.;
data integrity and confidentiality;
opt-in or opt-out data confidentiality 
to signaling messages 
depending on network environments 
or user requirements.
</t>

<t>
It is preferred that these security requirements
are considered as an integral part of the DMM design. 
</t>
</section>

<!-- 5.1.5 gap analysis with REQ1-1: distributed deployment -->

<section title="Distributed deployment">
<t>
The first DMM requirement has 2 parts.
The first part is on distributed deployment
whereas the second part is on avoiding longer routes.
</t>

<t>REQ1: (part 1)IP mobility, network access and routing solutions
provided by DMM 
MUST enable distributed deployment 
for mobility management of IP sessions 
(part 2)
so that traffic 
does not need to traverse centrally deployed
mobility anchors and thus
can be routed 
in an optimal manner. 
</t>

<t>
With the first part, multiple MRs can exist in MIPv6 
by simply having an HA for each home network.
Yet it is complicated for the MN to move its HA from one network to another.
Therefore this requirement is not fully met in the best current practice.
</t>

<t>
With the second part, 
one can examine dynamic mobility and route optimization
to be discussed later.
</t>

</section>

<!-- 5.1.6 gap analysis on REQ2: Transparency to Upper Layers when needed -->

<section title="Transparency to Upper Layers when needed">
<t>
To see how to avoid traversing centralized deployed mobility anchors,
let us look at the second requirement on non-optimal routes
[ID-dmm-requirements].
</t>

<t>
REQ2: DMM solutions MUST provide 
transparent mobility support above the IP layer 
when needed. 
Such transparency is needed,
for example, when, 
upon change of point of attachment to the Internet, 
an application flow cannot cope with a change 
in the IP address. 
Otherwise, support for
maintaining a stable home IP address or prefix 
during handovers may be declined. 
</t>

<t>
In order to avoid traversing long routes 
after the MN has moved to a new network,
the new network could simply be used
as the home network for new sessions.
</t>

<t>
Yet the capability to use different IP addresses for different IP sessions
are not in the existing mobility management functions.
This requirement is then not met in the best practice. 
</t>

</section>

<!-- 5.1.7 gap analysis: route optimization -->

<section title="Route optimization">
<t>
The second part of first requirement is on route optimization.
</t>

<t>
REQ1: (part 1)IP mobility, network access and routing solutions
provided by DMM 
MUST enable distributed deployment 
for mobility management of IP sessions 
(part 2)
so that traffic 
does not need to traverse centrally deployed
mobility anchors and thus
can be routed 
in an optimal manner. 
</t>

<t>
Although there are existing route optimization extensions,
they generally compromise with location privacy
so that this requirement is not met.

From the real deployment perspective,
