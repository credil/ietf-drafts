              Protocol Independent Multicast ECMP Redirect
                       draft-ietf-pim-ecmp-04.txt

Abstract

   A Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) router uses the Reverse Path
   Forwarding (RPF) procedure to select an upstream interface and router
   to build forwarding state.  When there are equal cost multiple paths
   (ECMP), existing implementations often use hash algorithms to select
   a path.  Such algorithms do not allow the spread of traffic among the
   ECMPs according to administrative metrics.  This usually leads to
   inefficient or ineffective use of network resources.  This document
   introduces the ECMP Redirect, a mechanism to improve the RPF
   procedure over ECMPs.  It allows ECMP path selection to be based on
   administratively selected metrics, such as data transmission delays,
   path preferences and routing metrics.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses terms defined in [RFC4601] to describe actions
   taken by PIM routers.

   The following terms have special significance for ECMP Redirect:

   o  Equal Cost Multiple Path (ECMP).  In this document, the term ECMP
      refers to parallel, single-hop, equal cost links between adjacent
      nodes.

   o  ECMP Bundle.  An ECMP bundle is a set of PIM enabled interfaces on
      a router, where all interfaces belonging to the same bundle share
      the same routing metric.  The next hops for the ECMP are all 1 hop
      away.

      There can be one or more ECMP bundles on any router, while one
      individual interface can only belong to a single bundle.  ECMP
      bundles are created on a router via configuration.

   o  RPF.  RPF stands for Reverse Path Forwarding.

   o  Upstream.  Towards the root of the multicast forwarding tree.  An
      upstream router refers to a router that is forwarding, or
      potentially capable of forwarding data packets onto interfaces in
      an ECMP bundle.

      When there are multiple routers forwarding packets onto interfaces
      in the ECMP bundle, all these routers are called upstream routers.

   o  Downstream.  Away from the root of the multicast forwarding tree.
      A downstream router is a router that uses an interface in the ECMP
      bundle as an RPF interface for a multicast forwarding entry.


2.  Introduction

   A PIM router uses the RPF procedure to select an upstream interface
   and a PIM neighbor on that interface to build forwarding state.  When
   there are equal cost multiple paths (ECMP) upstream, existing
   implementations often use hash algorithms to select a path.  Such
   algorithms do not allow the spread of traffic among the ECMP
   according to administrative metrics.  This usually leads to
   inefficient or ineffective use of network resources.  This document

Internet-Draft             PIMv2 ECMP Redirect                 June 2012


   introduces the ECMP Redirect, a mechanism to improve the RPF
   procedure over ECMP.  It allows ECMP path selection to be based on
   administratively selected metrics, such as data transmission delays,
   path preferences and routing metrics, or a combination of metrics.

   ECMPs are frequently used in networks to provide redundancy and to
   increase available bandwidth.  A PIM router selects a path in the
   ECMP based on its own implementation specific choice.  The selection
   is a local decision.  One way is to choose the PIM neighbor with the
   highest IP address, another is to pick the PIM neighbor with the best
   hash value over the destination and source addresses.

   While implementations supporting ECMP have been deployed widely, the
   existing RPF selection methods have weaknesses.  The lack of
   administratively effective ways to allocate traffic over alternative
   paths is a major issue.  For example, there is no straightforward way
   to tell two downstream routers to select either the same or different
   RPF neighbor routers for the same traffic flows.

   With the ECMP Redirect mechanism introduced here, the upstream
   routers use a PIM ECMP Redirect message to instruct the downstream
   routers on how to tie-break among the upstream neighbors.  The PIM
   ECMP Redirect message conveys the tie-break information based on
   metrics selected administratively.

2.1.  Overview

   The existing PIM Assert mechanism allows the upstream router to
   detect the existence of multiple forwarders for the same multicast
   flow onto the same downstream interface.  The upstream router sends a
   PIM Assert message containing a routing metric for the downstream
   routers to use for tie-breaking among the multiple upstream
   forwarders on the same RPF interface.

   With ECMP interfaces between the downstream and upstream routers, the
   PIM ECMP Redirect mechanism works in a similar way, but extends the
   ability to resolve the selection of forwarders among different
   interfaces in the ECMP.

   When a PIM router downstream of the ECMP interfaces creates a new
   (*,G) or (S,G) entry, it will populate the RPF interface and RPF
   neighbor information according to the rules specified by [RFC4601].
   This router will send its initial PIM Joins to that RPF neighbor.

   When the RPF neighbor router receives the Join message and finds that
   the receiving interface is one of the ECMP interfaces, it will check
   if the same flow is already being forwarded out of another ECMP
   interface.  If so, this RPF neighbor router will send a PIM ECMP

   Redirect message onto the interface the Join was received on.  The
   PIM ECMP Redirect message contains the address of the desired RPF
   neighbor, an interface ID [RFC6395], along with other parameters used
   as tie breakers.  In essence, a PIM ECMP Redirect message is sent by
   an upstream router to notify downstream routers to redirect PIM Joins
   to the new RPF neighbor via a different interface.  When the
   downstream routers receive this message, they SHOULD trigger PIM
   Joins toward the new RPF neighbor specified in the packet.

   This PIM ECMP Redirect message has similar functions as the existing
   PIM Assert message,

   1.  It is sent by an upstream router;
   2.  It is used to influence the RPF selection by downstream routers;
   3.  A tie breaker metric is used.

   However, the existing Assert message is used to select an upstream
   router within the same multi-access network (such as a LAN) while the
   Redirect message is used to select both a network and an upstream
   router.

   One advantage of this design is that the control messages are only
   sent when there is need to "re-balance" the traffic.  This reduces
   the amount of control traffic.

2.2.  Applicability

   The use of ECMP Redirect applies to shared trees or source trees
   built with procedures described in [RFC4601].  The use of ECMP
   Redirect in "Protocol Independent Multicast - Dense Mode" [RFC3973]
   or in "Bidirectional Protocol Independent Multicast" [RFC5015] is not
   considered in this document.

   The enhancement described in this document can be applicable to a
   number of scenarios.  For example, it allows a network operator to
   use ECMP paths and have the ability to perform load splitting based
   on bandwidth.  To do this, the downstream routers perform RPF
   selection with bandwidth instead of IP addresses as a tie breaker.
   The ECMP Redirect mechanism assures that all downstream routers
   select the desired network link and upstream router whenever
   possible.  Another example is for a network operator to impose a
   transmission delay limit on certain links.  The ECMP Redirect
   mechanism provides a means for an upstream router to instruct a
   downstream router to choose a different RPF path.

   This specification does not dictate the scope of applications of this
   mechanism.

3.  Protocol Specification

3.1.  Sending ECMP Redirect

   ECMP Redirects are sent by an upstream router in a rate limited
   fashion, under the following conditions,

   o  It detects a PIM Join on a non-desired outgoing interface; or
   o  It detects multicast traffic on a non-desired outgoing interface.

   In both cases, an ECMP Redirect is sent to the non-desired interface.
   An outgoing interface is considered "non-desired" when,

   o  The upstream router is already forwarding the same flow out of
      another interface belonging to the same ECMP bundle;
   o  The upstream router is not forwarding the flow yet out any
      interfaces of the ECMP bundle, but there is another interface with
      more desired attributes.

   An upstream router MAY choose not to send ECMP Redirects if it
   becomes aware that some of the downstream routers are unreachable via
   some links in ECMP bundle.

   An upstream router uses the "Neighbor Address" or the "Interface ID"
   field in the ECMP Redirect message to indicate the interface it wants
   traffic to be directed to.  This Neighbor Address MUST be associated
   with an interface in the same ECMP bundle as the ECMP Redirect
   message's outgoing interface.  If the Interface ID field is ignored,
   this Neighbor Address field uniquely identifies a LAN and an upstream
   router to which a downstream router SHOULD redirect its Join
   messages, and an ECMP Redirect message MUST be discarded if the
   Neighbor Address field in the message does not match the cached
   neighbor address.

   The Interface ID field is used in IPv4 when one or more RPF neighbors
   in the ECMP bundle are unnumbered, or in IPv6 where link local
   addresses are in use.  For other IPv4 usage, this field is zero'ed
   when sent, and ignored when received.  If the "Router ID" part of the
   Interface ID is zero, the field MUST be ignored.  See [RFC6395] for
   details of its assignment and usage in PIM Hellos.  If the Interface
   ID is not ignored, the receiving router of this message MUST use the
   Interface ID, instead of Neighbor Address, to identify the new RPF
   neighbor, and an ECMP Redirect message MUST be discarded if the
   Interface ID field in the message does not match the cached interface
   ID.

3.2.  Receiving ECMP Redirect

   When a downstream router receives an ECMP Redirect, and detects that
   the desired RPF path from its upstream router's point of view is
   different from its current one, it should choose to join the newly
   suggested path and prune from the current path.  The exact order of
   such actions is implementation specific.

   If a downstream router receives multiple ECMP Redirects sent by
   different upstream routers, it SHOULD use the Preference, Metric, or
   other fields as specified below, as the tie breakers to choose the
   most preferred RPF interface and neighbor.

   If an upstream router receives an ECMP Redirect, it SHOULD NOT change
   its forwarding behavior even if the ECMP Redirect makes it a less
   preferred RPF neighbor on the receiving interface.

3.3.  Transient State

   During a transient network outage with a single link cut in an ECMP
   bundle, a downstream router may lose connection to its RPF neighbor
   and the normal ECMP Redirect operation may be interrupted
   temporarily.  In such an event, the following actions are
   RECOMMENDED.

   The downstream router SHOULD select a new RPF neighbor.  Among all
   ECMP upstream routers, the one on the LAN the previous RPF neighbor
   resided on is preferred.

   If there is no upstream router reachable on the LAN the previous RPF
   neighbor resided on, the downstream router will select a new RPF
   neighbor on a different LAN.  Among all ECMP upstream routers, the
   one that served as RPF neighbor before the link failure is preferred.
   Such a router can be identified by the Router ID, which is part of
   the Interface ID in the PIM ECMP Redirect Hello option.

   During normal ECMP Redirect operations, when PIM Joins for the same
   (*,G) or (S,G) are received on a different LAN, an upstream router
   will send ECMP Redirect to prune the non-preferred LAN.  Such ECMP
   Redirects during partial network outage can be suppressed if the
   upstream router decides that the non-preferred PIM Join is from a
   router that is not reachable via the preferred LAN.  This check can
   be performed by retrieving the downstream's Router ID, using the
   source address in the PIM Join, and searching neighbors on the
   preferred LAN for one with the same router ID.

3.4.  Interoperability

   If a PIM router supports this specification, it MUST send the Hello
   option ECMP-Redirect-Supported TLV in its PIM Hello messages.

   A PIM router sends ECMP Redirects on an interface only when it
   detects that all neighbors on that interface have sent this Hello
   option.  If a PIM router detects that any of its neighbors on an ECMP
   bundle does not support this Hello option, it SHOULD NOT send ECMP
   Redirects to any interface in that bundle, however, it SHOULD still
   process any ECMP Redirects received from any interface in the same
   bundle.

   If a PIM router does not support this specification, it will ignore
   the ECMP-Redirect-Supported TLV in Hello and ECMP Redirects in PIM
   packets, which it receives.

   Metric (64 bits):   The second tie breaker if the "Preference" values
      are the same.  Numerically smaller metric is preferred.  This
      "Metric" can contain path parameters defined by users.  When both

      or "Interface ID" field is used as the third tie-breaker,
      depending on which field is used to identify the RPF neighbor, and
      the bigger value wins.


4.  IANA Considerations

   A PIM Hello Option Type is requested to be assigned to the PIM ECMP
   Redirect Hello Option.  According to [HELLO-OPT], 32 (0x20) has been
   temporarily assigned by IANA to the "PIM ECMP Redirect Hello Option
   Type".

   A PIM Message Type (TBD) is requested to be assigned to the ECMP
   Redirect message.  According to [RFC6166], the next available Type
   value is 11 (0xB).


5.  Security Considerations

   Security of the ECMP Redirect is only guaranteed by the security of
   the PIM packet, the security considerations for PIM Assert packets as
   described in [RFC4601] apply here.  Spoofed ECMP Redirect packets may
   cause the downstream routers to send PIM Joins to an undesired
   upstream router, and trigger more ECMP Redirect messages.  Security
   considerations for PIM packets described in [RFC4601] also apply to
   the new hello option defined here.
