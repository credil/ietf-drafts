    On demand IPv4 address provisioning in Dual-Stack PPP deployment
                               scenarios

Abstract

   Today the Dual-Stack approach is the most straightforward and the
   most common way for introducing IPv6 into existing systems and
   networks.  However a typical drawback of implementing Dual-Stack is
   that each node will still require at least one IPv4 address.  Hence,
   solely deploying Dual-Stack does not provide a sufficient solution to
   the IPv4 address exhaustion problem.  Assuming a situation where most
   of the IP communication (e.g. always-on, VoIP etc.) can be provided
   via IPv6, the usage of public IPv4 addresses can significantly be
   reduced and the unused public IPv4 addresses can under certain
   circumstances be returned to the public IPv4 address pool of the
   service provider.  New Dual-Stack enabled services can be introduced
   without increasing the public IPv4 address demand, when IPv6 will be
   the preferred network layer protocol.  This document describes such a
   solution in a Dual-Stack PPP session network scenario and explains
   the protocol mechanisms which are used.

1.  Abstract

   The Dual-Stack approach as defined in [RFC4213] provides the most
   straightforward and most common way for introducing IPv6 [RFC2460]
   into existing systems and networks.  However a typical drawback of
   the Dual-Stack approach is that each network node will still require
   at least one IPv4 [RFC0791] address.  Assuming a situation where most
   of the IP communication (e.g. always-on, VoIP etc.) can be provided
   via IPv6, the usage of public IPv4 addresses can be reduced
   significantly and the unused public IPv4 addresses may be returned to
   the public IPv4 address pool of the provider.  This document
   describes how such a solution can be realised in a Dual-Stack PPP
   session scenario and details the protocol mechanisms of the solution
   which are also thought as contribution to [BBF-WT-242].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]


2.  Problem Statement and Purpose of IPv4 address efficiency

   The Broadband Forum describes in [BBF-TR-187] a target IPv4/IPv6
   Dual-Stack Architecture (assuming native implementation of IPv6).
   TR-187 builds on the capabilities of existing protocols such as
   Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC1332] and Layer 2 Tunnelling
   Protocol (L2TP) [RFC2661] to provide IPv6 service in addition to
   today's IPv4 service.  These protocols allow the parallel usage of
   IPv4 and IPv6 within a single PPP respectively L2TP session.  Usually
   in such a scenario the service provider offers to the customer the
   usage of public IPv4 and IPv6 address resources during the duration
   of the PPP session.  Because of the potential parallel usage of IPv4
   and IPv6 within such a Dual-Stack PPP scenario an Public IPv4 address
   is always provisioned, also in the case where most of the
   communication is transported using IPv6.  This document extends the
   sketched Dual-Stack deployment scenario for PPP and L2TPv2 with a
   mechanism that allows a temporary assignment and a release of an
   unused IPv4 address within such a Dual-Stack capable PPP session
   scenario.  The IPv4 address may also only be provided on-demand later
   on, after initiating the Dual-Stack PPP session with an IPv6 address
   only.

2.1.  Architecture and Communication in a PPP Dual-Stack environment

   Assuming a Dual-Stack network access via PPP sessions, end devices
   can in general communicate via IPv4 and/or IPv6 transport, depending

   on their own and their IP communication partners capabilities.  The
   actual usage of IPv4 or IPv6 or both protocols depends on the
   capabilities of the IP communication endpoints (e.g. protocol stack,
   applications, configuration of the preferences etc.), the network
   itself and also on the used communication services (like e.g.  VoIP).
   The later two are mainly in responsibility of the network and service
   provider.  The approach, sketched in this document, is based on the
   assumption that the customer starts a Dual-Stack PPP session in
   "IPv6-only" mode and "adds" IPv4 later on only in the case that
   applications or services explicitly request IPv4 connectivity.  When
   IPv4 connectivity is not needed during the whole time of PPP network
   connectivity than a continuous provisioning of a global IPv4 address
   to the customer device (e.g. end system, CPE etc.) is not necessary.
   Therefore mechanisms are needed to provision and release public IPv4
   addresses for Dual-Stack PPP sessions dynamically.

   The goal of the solution sketched in this document, is to limit and
   decrease the public IPv4 address pool size of the PPP network access
   provider.  Assuming that always-on services are reachable via IPv6, a
   Dual-Stack capable PPP connected device should per default request
   IPv4 address parameters only on demand, when the need for
   establishing IPv4 connectivity has been detected and IPv4 traffic
   towards the PPP WAN interface (e.g. of a CPE) is intended.  As
   already described above it is sufficient, when initially only IPv6
   address parameters are provisioned to the PPP customer endpoint (e.g.
   end systems, Home Gateway, CPE).

   This means that this customer device does not initially start a
   complete Dual-Stack PPP session but an "IPv6 only" PPP session.  The
   IPv4 part of the complete Dual-Stack is initiated later on only in
   the case that IPv4 connectivity is explicitly requested.

                   Figure 1: PPP Dual-Stack architecture

   The figure above shows the architecture of a PPP Dual-Stack
   environment for providing Internet access for residential customers.

   The abstract topology normally consists of 3 components:

   1.  Private Internet (aka.  Customer LAN)

   2.  Public Internet

   3.  Service Provider AAA area

   The Private Internet as defined in [RFC1918] is the local area
   network on customer site wherein IPv4 and IPv6 communication are
   provided.  The Private Internet is an optional part of the PPP Dual-
   Stack architecture.  Within the Customer LAN exist one or more
   private hosts which are connected to the local area network
   interfaces of the Customer Premise Equipment.  These hosts can have

   IPv4-only, IPv6-only or Dual-Stack communication capabilities.  For
   IPv6 communication inside the Customer LAN Unique Local or public
   IPv6 addresses may be used.  For IPv6 communication to the public
   Internet public IPv6 addresses should be used.  For IPv4
   communication within the Customer LAN and to the public Internet it
   is assumed that private IPv4 addresses must be used by the private
   hosts.  In order to ensure IPv4 communication to the public Internet
   the CPE must hence provide IPv4 Network Address Translation (NAT44)
   functionality and map the private IPv4 addresses of the private hosts
   to a public IPv4 address of the WAN interface of the NAT and vice
   versa.  The NAT functionality on the CPE is the border element
   between the private IPv4 Internet (aka.  Customer LAN) and the public
   IPv4 Internet.  In the case of using public IPv6 addresses for the
   communication the CPE and its interfaces are an integral part of the
   public Internet.

   To the public Internet belong the Access Network of the service
   provider and all other networks outside the customer LAN that are
   addressed with global IPv4 and / or IPv6 addresses and can be
   accessed from the private Internet as well as from other systems
   within the public Internet.

   The focus of this draft is directed to the access network of the
   service provider where in our scenario PPP is used between the CPE
   and the NAS in order to provide customer access to the public
   Internet.

   The Service Provider AAA area is a network which consists of several
   systems to control the Network Access Server (NAS) and to provide AAA
   functionalities in order to reduce the load on the NAS.  Such Service
   Provider AAA functionalities include also management of the public
   IPv4 and public IPv6 address pools inside the NAS and can hence also
   be integrated directly into the NAS.

2.2.  The advantage of the dynamic address assigning feature

   This approach is based on the assumption that the customer initiates
   a PPP session based on IPv6 and uses IPv4 only if applications or
   services require explicit IPv4 connectivity.  A public IPv4 address
   can therefore provided sequentially to different customers during the
   runtime of their PPP connections.  This enables a smooth migration
   from IPv4 to IPv6 in comparison to other IPv4-IPv6 migration
   approaches (e.g.  NAT in service provider network).  The customer
   will be provisioned with a public IPv4 address only in the case when
   global IPv4 connectivity is really needed and will not be provisioned
   with an IPv4 address per default when the Dual-Stack PPP session is
   initiated.  Furthermore, a provisioned IPv4 address can be released
   (e.g. after a certain time interval) in the case that the CPE detects

Internet-Draft   draft-fleischhauer-ipv4-addr-saving-01   September 2011


   that there is no need any more for global IPv4 connectivity.  Or in
   other words, when global IPv4 connectivity is not needed during the
   whole time of the PPP session then a (continuous) provisioning of a
   public IPv4 address to the CPE is not necessary and the provisioning
   of a public IPv4 address can be done on-demand and dynamically.

   The main goal of this mechanism is to limit and decrease the pool
   size for public IPv4 addresses at the service provider site.

   A similar effect in limiting and decreasing the IPv4 address demand
   could also be achieved by using separate PPP sessions for IPv4 and
   IPv6.  But in that case the following problems occur:

   o  For each additional PPP session additional AAA parameters have to
      be created and handled which leads to an extension of AAA domains
      and more complex processes.

   o  Each additional PPP session will require additional resources on
      the PPP endpoints (e.g. for handling additional customer
      credentials) as well in devices that act as PPP intermediate
      agents.

   o  Accounting and controlling of traffic classes on an access line or
      customer base will be impeded or at least complicated.

   Because of these reasons the introduction of IPv6 as additional
   network layer protocol on a access line with an additional PPP
   session is not recommended.


3.  Specification

   As defined in RFC 2661 [RFC2661] PPP and L2TP provide the following
   main functionalities:

   1.  A method for encapsulating datagrams over serial links.

   2.  A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing, configuring, and
       testing the data-link connection.

   3.  (Optional) Authentication Protocol for one or both peers.

   4.  A family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and
       configuring different network-layer protocols.

   For provisioning of IPv4 or IPv6 communication parameters (e.g.
   addresses, DNS resolver) as network-layer protocols only the NCPs
   Internet Protocol (Version 4) Control Protocol (IPCP) RFC 1332

   [RFC1332] and Internet Protocol (Version 6) Control Protocol (IPV6CP)
   RFC 2472 [RFC2472] are used.  Whereas IPCP is responsible for
   configuring, enabling, and disabling the IPv4 protocol modules on
   both ends of the point-to-point link, IPV6CP is responsible for
   configuring, enabling, and disabling the IPv6 protocol modules on
   both ends of the point-to-point link.  Once one of both network-layer
   protocols has been configured, datagrams from this network-layer
   protocol can be sent over the PPP link.  Both NCP protocol mechanisms
   are independent from each other (see also requirement WLL-3 in
   [RFC6204]).

   An implementation wishing to close a dedicated NCP connection (e.g.
   IPCP or IPv6CP) SHOULD transmit a Terminate-Request to the peer.
   Upon reception of a Terminate-Request, a Terminate-Ack MUST be
   transmitted to the sender of the Terminate-Request.  The PPP session
   itself and the other NCP connection inside the PPP session will
   remain existent.  Only in the case that both NCP connections are
   closed, the PPP session will be terminated.

3.1.  Definition of the participating elements and their functionalities

   This chapter names the network elements that are involved in the
   message flows to enable the on-demand IPv4 address provisioning
   functionality and describes their functionalities related to this
   mechanism.

   Customer Edge Router (CER aka.  CPE)/End System

   This is any device implementing a Dual-Stack PPP stack and acting as
   a PPP client to the PPP server in the service provider network in
   order to achieve connectivity to the service provider network.  The
   PPP interface of this device is also called WAN interface [RFC6204].
   In the case of a Customer Edge Router (CER) this is a node (e.g.
   intended for home or small office usage) which forwards IPv4 and IPv6
   packets those are not explicitly addressed to itself .  Therefore the
   demand for IPv4 connectivity of such a Customer Edge Router will be
   triggered either by own applications or by receiving IPv4 packets on
   its customer network facing interfaces that are addressed to the
   public Internet.  In the case of an End System, this system is a node
   that intends to send IPv4 and/or IPv6 packets.  On a End System the
   IPv4 connectivity demand can only be triggered by own applications.
   However, in both cases the IPv4_idle_timer resides on the WAN
   interface in order to detect IPv4 packets passing the WAN interface
   (incoming/ outgoing) and to measure the related IPv4 idle time when
   no IPv4 packet has been sent or received.

   Network Access Server (NAS)/Layer 2 Network Server (LNS)

   The Network Access Server (NAS) is a device providing local Dual-
   Stack PPP connectivity to the Service Provider network and acting as
   a PPP server to the PPP client on the Customer Edge Router or
   customer end system.  Within a RFC 2661 architecture the PPP server
   within the service provider network is the L2TP Network Server (LNS).
   The address pool management can be provided locally on the NAS/LNS or
   remotely.  In the case of a local address pool management no
   information exchange to an external address pool management system is
   needed in order to assign or release IPv4 addresses.  In the case of
   an external address pool management an information exchange between
   the NAS/LNS and the address pool management system is required.

   External Address Pool Management

   External Address Pool Management is used in the case when no local
   Address Pool Management system is implemented in the NAS/LNS.  In
   this case it is necessary that the NAS/LNS communicates with an
   External Address Pool Management System for assigning or releasing
   IPv4 addresses.  RADIUS as specified in [RFC2865] or DIAMETER as
   specified in [RFC3588] can be used as protocol between NAS/LNS and
   the External Address Pool Management System.

3.2.  Assigning IPv4 address parameter on-demand after establishing PPP
      and IPv6 connectivity

   A PPP client implementation wishing to open a connection MUST
   transmit a NCP Configure-Request to the PPP server.  If every
   Configuration Option received in a NCP Configure-Request is
   recognizable and all values are acceptable, then the PPP server
   implementation MUST transmit a NCP Configure-Ack to the initiator of
   the NCP Configure-Request.

   Applied to the above sketched Dual-Stack PPP session use case the
   configuration and enabling of the IPv6 protocol module can be done
   immediately after a successful LCP data link configuration (and maybe
   successful authentication) of the PPP session.

   Separately from that, the IPv4 protocol module can be configured and
   enabled using IPCP.  However this SHALL only be done in the case that
   an IPv4 connectivity demand has been detected on the PPP customer end
   system or CPE (PPP client).  Therefore the NAS MUST not initiate the

        Figure 2: Message flow for assigning IPv4 address parameter

   In the diagram above, the CPE/End System is triggered (1) to set up
   IPv4 connectivity via an already existing PPP session.  The CPE/End
   System detects that there is no public IPv4 address for its WAN
   interface available and starts the negotiation of the needed IPv4
   address parameter by sending an IPCP Configure-Request to the NAS
   (2).  The NAS will request the corresponding IPv4 connectivity
   parameters (e.g.  IPv4 address, DNS resolver address) from a local
   (e.g. within the NAS) or remote database representing the Address
   Pool Management System(e.g. via RADIUS/DIAMETER) (3, 4).  After this
   the PPP peers use the standard IPCP procedures to finalize the IPv4
   address parameter negotiation (5, 6, 7, 8, 9).  After the successful
   provisioning of the IPv4 address parameter the CPE/End system has
   full global IPv4 connectivity and can proceed with the IPv4
   communication.  In case of an external Address Pool Management, the
   NAS will send an Accounting-Request message (10) to the external
   Address Pool Management System in order to signal the successful
   negotiation of the IPv4 address parameter.  The external Address Pool
   Management System will answer with an Accounting-Response (11)
   message.

3.3.  Releasing unused IPv4 address parameters

   An implementation wishing to close a dedicated NCP connection (e.g.
   IPCP or IPv6CP) SHOULD transmit a Terminate-Request to the peer.
   Upon reception of a NCP Terminate-Request, a Terminate-Ack MUST be
   transmitted to the sender of the Terminate-Request.

   In the PPP Dual-Stack session scenario discussed here, the generation
   of the Terminate-Request message for the IPCP part of the PPP Dual-
   Stack session MUST be triggered by an IPv4 traffic idle timer within
   the PPP client (e.g. end system, CPE).  As long as there is still an

   ongoing IPv6 connection within the PPP session, the PPP session MUST
   be kept open.  Equivalently, when no IPv6 connectivity is detected
   the IPV6CP session can be terminated again by sending an IPv6CP
   Terminate-Request and accepting this by a Terminate-Ack.  Afterwards
   the link layer connectivity and hence the whole PPP connection can be
   terminated by exchanging the LCP Terminate-Request and Terminate-Ack
   messages.

        Figure 3: Message flow for releasing IPv4 address parameter

   The termination of an IPCP session is illustrated in figure 3 above.
   Within this exemplary message flow it is assumed that there is still
   an IPV6CP connection active inside the Dual-Stack PPP session.  After
   the expiration of the IPv4 traffic idle timer (1) the CPE/End system
   sends an IPCP terminate request to the peer (2).  The request will be
   answered with an Terminate-Ack message (3).  The IPv4 address can be
   returned to the local address pool (e.g. within the NAS) or to the
   remote IPv4 address pool by sending Interim-Accounting messages (4,
   5) (e.g. via RADIUS/DIAMETER).

3.4.  Timer Considerations

   IPv4_Idle_Timer

   The sending of the Terminate-Request message MUST be triggered by an
   IPv4 traffic idle timer within the PPP client (e.g. end system, CPE).
   The timer value MUST be configurable to adopt the mechanism due to
   the needs of the applications which are using IPv4 and with respect
   to an optimization of the IPv4 address saving potential.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   TBD.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs
   [RFC5226] for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do
   anything, the section contains an explicit statement that this is the
   case (as above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section
   will be removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.


6.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
