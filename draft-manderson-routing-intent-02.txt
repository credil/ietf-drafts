Internet-Draft  Routing Intent in IANA Address Registries    August 2011


1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft  Routing Intent in IANA Address Registries    August 2011


2.  Introduction

   The IANA address registries currently do not have a uniform and
   consistent nomenclature to signal if an allocation is intended to be
   publicly routed.  While some registries, such as the IANA IPv4
   Special Purpose Address Registry [RFC5736], include a column
   describing routing scope it is the exception.  The consequence of
   this is that at present the intended routing posture of many
   allocations is, at best, implied.

   Work is underway in the IETF to design and document a number of
   systems or architectures to facilitate the desire to secure the
   Internet routing system.  [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch] describes one such
   architecture.  Such work will require an explicit statement as to the
   intended public routability of an allocation.  Over time several
   architectures may come to exist, and in support of the idea of
   routing security, this document provides direction to IANA to mark
   existing and future IANA IPv4 [RFC0791] and IPv6 [RFC2460]
   allocations with generic terms pertaining to the Public (global)
   Routing Intent (PRI) and with a granularity that removes any possible
   ambiguity in interpreting the address registry.

   These well defined generic terms can then be applied in technology
   solutions that address routing security, or other routing concerns.

3.  Definitions

   Publically Routed: Where the announcement of a prefix contained
   within, or representing, an allocation is exchanged between 2 or more
   Autonomous Systems that do not share a common and unified routing
   policy except for the announcement and acceptance of routes
   containing a prefix directly allocated to themselves.

   Routable: An IPv4 [RFC0791] or IPv6 [RFC2460] prefix that is intended
   to be (publicly) routed.

   Not Routable: An IPv4 [RFC0791] or IPv6 [RFC2460] prefix that is NOT
   intended to be (publicly) routed.

4.  Wording for future IETF Documents

   All future IETF documents that request IANA [RFC5226] to allocate,
   assign, or reserve an IPv4 [RFC0791] or IPv6 [RFC2460] address block
   MUST include a statement for each and every unique prefix it requests
   that describes the routing intent for the prefix.  Suitable examples
   are:


   1) This prefix, 2001:DB8::/32, is to be considered Routable.
   2) 2001:DB8::/32 is for private use and intended to be Not Routable.
   3) The assignment of 2001:DB8::/32 is intended to be Routable.

5.  Special Address Registries

   The IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Address Registry [RFC5736] already
   contains a routing scope definition.  While this registry is the
   exception for address registries, the PRI column MUST be added to the
   IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Address Registry leaving the existing
   Routing Scope in place for additional information to the reader.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document directs IANA to extend all the IPv4 and IPv6 address
   registries to record Public Routing Intent (PRI) as either "Routable"
   or "Not Routable".  This intent should be initially taken from the
   appendices in [I-D.ietf-sidr-iana-objects] for reserved, special use,
   and unallocated address space.  Address space already allocated to
   the Regional Internet Registries or other entities for use on the
   public internet MUST be marked as "Routable".  Future standards
   action IETF documents that request action in all IANA IPv4 or IPv6
   addresses registries MUST include a statement pertaining to the
   routing intent of the resulting action as described in this document.

   Implementation of this document further requires IANA to update the
   IPv4 and IPv6 address registries to use a granularity commensurate
   with the most specific entry in the address registry.  An example
   registry can be found in Appendix A (Appendix A).

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not alter the security profile for IANA IPv4
   [RFC0791] or IPv6 [RFC2460] address registries.
