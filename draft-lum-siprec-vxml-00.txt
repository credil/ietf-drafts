Abstract

   This document addresses the use case of recording Interactive Voice
   Response (IVR) VoiceXML applications using the SIPREC protocol.  This
   document also provides a potential solution for capturing additional
   information about the call flow within the VoiceXML application from
   a recording perspective.

1.  Introduction

   One of the use case defined in [RFC6341] is the use of recording
   self-service Interactive Voice Response (IVR) calls.  Recording IVR
   calls are required in some cases to meet compliance requriements or
   to provide application performance tuning purposes.  VoiceXML is the
   standard for defining a voice dialog, and this document provides a
   proposed method for providing SIPREC metadata for VoiceXML sessions.
   A list of requirements is provided define the scope of the solution
   defined in this document.

1.1.  Usage

   As VoiceXML is the standard markup for defining voice dialogs, the
   usage of a voice dialog varies a depending on the use cases.  The
   main use case for VoiceXML application is to provide a self-service
   voice application, for example, to take self-service orders for the
   user.  In some environments it is required that the voice application
   must be recorded before any self-service transaction can take place,
   and this means that the voice application must have some form of
   awareness that the recording is taking place at the moment before
   presenting the option of self-service transaction to the user.
   Certain types of self-service transactions may request the user to
   enter sensitive information such as a PIN or the CVV of a credit
   card, and it is required that the VoiceXML application has the
   ability to explicitly mark certain parts of the application as
   sensitive portion and that recording is paused while taking senstive
   data.

   Another type usage for a VoiceXML application would be started within
   a media server dialog to provide basic annoucements, prompts, or
   controls.  This type of usage is typically not related to self-
   service transactions while does require recording for compliance
   purposes.  Recording may be useful in this context to provide data to
   help tuning and reporting of the application.

1.2.  Deployment types

   Depending on the implementation of the IVR and the implementation of
   the VoiceXML interpreter, there are different ways recording can
   happen based on the deployment model.  As per [RFC5552], the IVR is a
   SIP User Agent that serves VoiceXML applications.  The IVR in this
   case can be a SIPREC-aware SIP UA and relies on a separate SRC to
   provide recording capabilities.  Being a SIPREC-aware SIP UA allows
   the IVR to provide recording indications to the VoiceXML application.

   The IVR can also be implemented as an SRC so that the IVR can
   directly initiate recording sessions to an SRS.  This gives the IVR
   more control over local recording policies by ensuring recording can
   happen before executing certain VoiceXML applications that require
   recording.

2.  Recording requirements for VoiceXML applications

   REQ1:  Provide an ability for the VoiceXML application to know that
      it is being recorded.

   REQ2:  Provide an ability for the VoiceXML application to pause/
      resume certain parts of the application from being recorded

   REQ3:  Define the scope which the recording starts or stops within
      the VoiceXML application.

   REQ4:  Capture DTMF input as media or metadata.

   REQ5:  Define metadata format to provide essential information about
      the recorded application.

   REQ6:  Define additional metadata to provide detailed information
      about about the application executed.

3.  Solution

3.1.  VoiceXML extensions

3.1.1.  Recording indication

Internet-Draft   Recording VoiceXML sessions with SIPREC       July 2013


   The VoiceXML interpreter can provide a new session variable called
   session.recording (a boolean) to indicate whether recording is
   currently taking place.  It is possible that the recording is taking
   place over the connection by a separate SRC, so a separate session
   variable called session.connection.recording (a boolean) can indicate
   whether the recording is taking place over the connection.

   If the recording is taking place over the connection while the
   application is executing, a new event can be thrown so that the
   application can catch this event.  The new event is called
   connection.record, and the default action would not reprompt so that
   an application which does not care about this event can simply ignore
   this event.

3.1.2.  Pause/Resume

   As the use case for pause/resume is to mask the recording while
   taking sensitive data, this can map naturally to the <field> element
   in VoiceXML.  A new attribute siprec:mask (boolean) is introduced to
   note that the field is taking sensitive data and shall mask the audio
   portion when accepting input for this field.  If the IVR is an SRC,
   then the SRC would initiate a pause request while accepting input for
   the field, and then resume when the field is filled.  If the IVR is a
   SIPREC-aware SIP UA, then the IVR would request to pause the
   recording, and it is up to the SRC to determine whether the recording
   is pause or not.

3.2.  DTMF input

   The typical input method for an IVR application is DTMF input, and in
   addition, some VoiceXML applications supports speech input.  In order
   to ensure the recording of the VoiceXML application captures DTMF as
   input, the media codec telephone-event must be supported to record
   DTMF input, which is part of the audio media stream.

3.3.  Metadata

   The IVR is modeled as a participant in a Communication Session.  As
   per [I-D.ietf-siprec-metadata], the participant only contains the
   address of record.  Additional information can be provided about the
   VoiceXML session to provide more context of about the IVR.  Example
   attributes:

   o  The URI of the VoiceXML page;

   o  The session.connection.* session variables;

   o  Any input parameters to the VoiceXML page, such as parmaters
      injected by a media server dialog;

   o  <exit> namelist parameters

   o  Any additional messages and parameters logged by the VoiceXML
      application.

   Some pieces of metadata relevant to a VoiceXML application may be
   generated during runtime, for example, the <exit> tag can only happen
   as the last statement in the application.  Any metadata generated
   after the initial execution of the VoiceXML session may not get a
   chance to provide the metadata in the initial INVITE or UPDATE in the
   RS.  The SRC would need to initiate an UPDATE to provide additional
   metadata to the SRS.  It is important to note that it is not a good
   idea to generate an UPDATE every time new messages or parameters are
   generated by the VoiceXML application, as this can potentially
   generate large amount of SIP transactions.  The SRC should either
   wait until the end of the VoiceXML session to present all the
   metadata or limit the rate which UPDATE transactions are generated.
