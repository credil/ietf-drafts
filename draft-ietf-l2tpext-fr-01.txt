Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) describes a mechanism to tunnel
Point-to-Point (PPP) sessions.  The protocol has been designed to be
independent of the media it runs over.  The base specification
describes how it should be implemented to run over the User Datagram
Protocol (UDP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).  This document
describes how L2TP is implemented over Frame Relay Permanent Virtual
Circuits (PVCs) and Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs).

This document is a product of the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol
Extensions Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
