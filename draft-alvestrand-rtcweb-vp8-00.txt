Internet-Draft                   VP8 MTI                    October 2012


1.  Introduction

   As described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview], successful interoperable
   deployment of RTCWEB requires that implementations share a video
   codec.  Not requiring a video codec will mean that this decision is
   left to processes outside the standards process, and risks the
   spectre of fragmented deployment.

   This memo argues that VP8 should be that codec.


2.  Requirements for an MTI codec

   As outlined by the presentation given at the IETF meeting at IETF 84
   in Vancouver, it is unclear what the hard requirements for a video
   codec are, but the items that it was suggested that proposals give
   information on were:

   o  Image quality - comparative data was sought, but without defining
      a baseline

   o  Performance - what resolutions / frame rates can be achieved in
      software on some common systems

   o  Power consumption of hardware and/or software implementations

   o  Hardware support

   o  IPR status

   This document lays out the available information in each category.


3.  Definition of VP8

   VP8 is defined in [RFC6386], and its RTP payload is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-payload-vp8] .  There are no profiles; all decoders are
   able to decode all valid media streams.


4.  Image quality evaluations

   In tests carried out by Google on a set of ten sample video clips
   containing typical video-conference content, VP8 outperformed the
   x264 H.264 codec running the constrained baseline profile by on
   average 37.2%.  That is, at the same quality, measured by PSNR, VP8
   produced 37.2% fewer bits on average than H.264.  VP8 outperformed
   H.264 on all ten of the test clips by between 19% and 64%.  Both

Internet-Draft                   VP8 MTI                    October 2012


   codecs were configured in one-pass mode using settings conducive to
   real-time operation, and the ten clips varied in size between 640x360
   pixels and 1280x720 pixels.

   An independent evaluation by Christian Feller and Mohammed Raad,
   presented to ISO/IEC SC29 WG11 in July 2012, showed that VP8
   performed better than the (H.264 baseline) anchors for the IVC
   project on a majority of the cases.


5.  Performance evaluation

5.1.  Software

   The current reference implementation is libvpx, developed in the WebM
   project.

   The encoding speed in software depends on the quality setting.  On a
   stock PC platform using an Intel Xeon CPU at 2.67 GHz, in a test
   using extremely difficult 720p material and encoding at a target data
   rate of 2 Mbit/sec, VP8's encoding speed varied from 48.4 fps (at the
   setting used in WebRTC today) to 96.2 fps (at the fastest setting),
   using a single thread.  This variation in encode speed is achieved by
   changing the configuration of VP8 encoding tools in a deterministic
   way to trade-off encoding speed with output quality.

   On a stock PC platform using an Intel Xeon CPU with 8 cores at
   2.27GHz, tests using difficult 720p material encoded at 2 Mbit/sec
   show that using a single thread VP8 can decode at 200.50 fps (in
   comparison H.264, baseline profile, achieves 107.95 fps), using four
   threads VP8 decodes at 519.96 fps (H.264 achieves 363.73 fps), and
   using sixteen threads VP8 decodes at 1,076.49 fps (H.264 achieves
   807.11 fps). .

5.2.  Hardware support

   To date, Google has licensed VP8 hardware accelerators to over 50
   chip manufacturers, and VP8 hardware IP cores have also been made
   available by Imagination Technologies, Verisilicon and Chips & Media.
   Furthermore, Google is aware of several 3rd party implementations of
   VP8 decoders and encoders from the world's leading semiconductor
   companies.

   At the time of this writing, more than a dozen of chip manufacturers
   have announced chips with 1080p VP8 support, including Samsung
   (Exynos 5), NVIDIA (Tegra 3), Marvell (Armada 1500), Broadcom
   (BCM28150), Texas Instruments (OMAP54xx), Freescale (i.MX 6), ST-
   Ericsson (NovaThor L9540), LG Electronics, Hisilicon (K3v2), Rockchip

   (RK2918, RK3066), Nufront (NS115), Ziilabs (ZMS40) and Allwinner
   (A10).  Google estimates that a clear majority of leading mobile
   chipsets in 2013 will contain VP8 hardware support.

5.3.  Hardware performance

   Several of the aforementioned hardware implementations are based on
   the WebM video hardware designs described at
   http://www.webmproject.org/hardware/.  Performance figures include:

   o  Decode of 1080p video at 30 fps at less than 100 MHz clock
      frequency

   o  Decoding more than ten simultaneous SD video streams on a single
      chip

   o  Less than 25 milliwatts of power for 1080p decoding

   o  Encoding 1080p video at 30 fps at less than 220 MHz clock
      frequency

   o  Less than 80 milliwatts of power for HD video encoding

   Based on the Hantro G1 multiformat decoder implementation, the VP8
   hardware decoder is 45% smaller in silicon area than the H.264 High
   Profile decoder.  VP8 also requires 18% less DRAM bandwidth than
   H.264 as it does not use bidirectional inter prediction, allowing
   significant reductions in the overall decoding system power
   consumption.


6.  IPR status

   Google has made its position clear with respect to Google-owned IPR
   in its licensing terms,
   http://www.webmproject.org/license/additional/.

   As of this moment (October 5, 2012), Google's royalty-free license
   commitment is the only IPR statement filed against RFC 6386 in the
   IETF disclosures database.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

8.  Security Considerations

   Codec definitions do not in themselves comprise security risks, as
   long as there is no means of embedding active content in their
   datastream.  VP8 does not contain such active content.

   Codec implementations have frequently been the cause of security
   concerns.  The reference implementation of VP8 has been extensively
   tested by Google security experts, and is believed to be free from
   exploitable vulnerabilities.  There is a continuous program in place
   to ensure that any vulnerabilities identified are repaired as quickly
   as possible.
