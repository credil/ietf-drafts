Internet-Draft            Link Format and WADL                 Sept 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) working group aims at
   providing a comprehensive suite of standards that will make it
   possible to build a REST architecture for M2M applications with
   highly constrained nodes and networks.

   The CoRE Link Format [I-D.ietf-core-link-format] which is part of
   this suite defines a format to be used by CoAP servers to list hosted
   resources using the Web linking technique defined in RFC 5988
   [RFC5988].  More specically the 'if' attribute of Link Format allows
   an interface designer indicate a description of the behavior, the
   parameters, the representation and eventually the set of sub-
   resources associated to a given CoRE resource.  One way to describe
   the interface to a resource is using the Web Application Description
   Language (WADL).

   The first part of this document will explain how to benefit from WADL
   to describe the REST interface of CoRE resources.  Then the second
   part of the document will show how the previous guidelines are
   applied in different use cases.

   The reader should keep in mind that this document does not suggest in
   any way constrained nodes would be able to retrieve and parse a WADL
   description.  The interface description is rather considered as
   documentation with a standard and machine-processable language that
   will help implementors to understand an interface and eventually
   generate stub code.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  WADL in a CoRE environment

3.1.  CoAP adaptations

   The WADL language is primilarily designed to describe HTTP-based web
   applications.  WADL is not strongly tied to the HTTP protocol
   [RFC2616] and any HTTP-like web protocol can be described with WADL.
   In a CoRE environment the CoAP protocol [I-D.ietf-core-coap] is
   deployed in place of the HTTP protocol as an optimized web transfer
   protocol.  An interface designer must take into consideration the
   specifity of CoAP while writing the WADL definition.

Internet-Draft            Link Format and WADL                 Sept 2011


3.1.1.  Methods

   CoAP only supports a subset of HTTP methods.  So a WADL description
   deployed in a CoRE environment MUST only make use of methods
   available in CoAP namely GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.

3.1.2.  Status code

   CoAP decorrelates the response code representation from the actual
   value of the code.  Hence the response code 2.00 has the value 64.
   When a CoAP response code is associated to the description of a
   response in WADL, it is RECOMMENDED to use the response code labels.

3.1.3.  HTTP header parameters

   CoAP does not support user-defined options in the base specification.
   So as a rule of thumb, header parameters are discouraged with CoAP.

3.2.  CoRE resources

   The WADL language describes a REST resource with a resource element
   which associates a REST behavior to a URI.  WADL offers language
   elements to describe the following aspects of a REST behavior:
   allowed methods, query string parameters, media type of the request
   and response content, URI of the resource and the subordinate
   resources.  The description of the behavior can either be a reference
   to a resource_type element or child elements if the description is
   inline.

   When WADL is combined with the CoRE Link Format it is RECOMMENDED to
   write definitions with resource_type elements.  Then a Web link can
   reference a resource_type with the Interface Description 'if'
   attribute.  So a Web link plays the same role as the resource element
   of WADL in the sense that the Web link instantiates a resource_type
   by linking it to an URI.

   Because the resource_type element is referenced outside of the WADL
   description, the rules of section 2.5.1 in WADL [wadl] are not
   applicable.  Instead the target URI of the Web link where the
   resource_type element is referenced MUST be used as the base URI to
   construct each child resource identifiers.

   The 'if' attribute of a Web link SHOULD reference a resource_type AND
   a WADL document to avoid potential ambiguities. resource_type
   elements are identified by their XML id.  The 'if' attribute MAY take
   the form of an URI.  The path of the URI specify the WADL document
   while the fragment part of the URI points to a resource_type.  The
   full URI notation may add significant overhead in a link format

   description thus several formats are acceptable depending on the risk
   of identifier conflicts.  Here are few examples of 'if' attributes.

   o  http://www.example.org/interface.wadl#resourceType

   o  interface.wadl#resourceType

   o  resourceType

3.3.  Semantic description

   The main goal of the WADL description in a CoRE environment is to
   describe the actions that can be performed on a REST resource.  The
   WADL document may include a grammar element with a schema to offer a
   detailed description of data representations hence semantically
   refining the description.  But this mechanism is not applicable to
   all data representations especially if the data is not XML-based.
   Moreover the interface description is not meant to be directly
   interpreted by CoRE nodes.  Thus it is RECOMMENDED to associate the
   semantic description of a resource with a resource type 'rt'
   attribute without relying only on the 'if' attribute.  This
   separation of concerns allows an interface designer to reuse the same
   interface description for resources that grasp different concepts.

3.4.  Binary XML format

   Because CoRE deals with constrained networks, traditional XML data
   representations may be superseded with a more compact format for the
   XML information set.  Efficient XML Interchange [exi] is an example
   of such binary XML format which heavily relies on a XML schema to
   achieve the best compression performances.  The schema identifier can
   be carried inline with the binary stream or specified out-of-band.
   If there is no schema identifier present in the data stream but the
   WADL definition of the representation has a reference to grammar
   element, one MUST assume that the data stream is schema-informed.


4.  Use cases

4.1.  WADL resource type identifiers

   Let's consider an organization which has defined two application
   profiles in two separate WADL documents.  The first profile targets
   Home Automation applications while the second deals with Energy
   Management.  One CoRE device may implement REST services from both
   profiles.

   The WADL descriptions are versioned to support future evolutions of

   the interface.  The profiles have a class/type structure with a dot
   notation for REST resource types.  They also share some concepts but
   with different implementations.  Figure 1 and Figure 2 are short
   extracts of possible WADL descriptions for such profiles.

                                 Figure 2

   In a home network, the devices share the same infrastructure but
   usually come from different vendors and may implement many
   application profiles.  In this context it is useful to reference a
   WADL interface with an absolute URI.

   REQ: GET /.well-known/core
   RES: 2.00 OK
   </tmp>;rt="AirTemperature";
   if="http://www.example.org/ha1.wadl#sensor.temperature",
   </tmp/thr>;rt="TemperatureAlarm";
   if="http://www.example.org/ha1.wadl#parameter.threshold"
   </pwr>;rt="PowerConsumption";
   if="http://www.example.org/em2.wadl#meter.power",
   </pwr/thr>;rt="PowerAlarm";
   if="http://www.example.org/em2.wadl#parameter.threshold"

   If a deployment of devices is known to implement only REST services
   from one organization the resource_type identifiers may be shortened.
   It is however indispensable to clearly indicate a WADL document

   because the resource_type identifiers are only unique within a single
   WADL document.  The example below reflects how these assumptions are
   actually applied.

   REQ: GET /.well-known/core
   RES: 2.00 OK
   </tmp>;rt="AirTemperature";if="ha1.wadl#sensor.temperature",
   </tmp/thr>;rt="TemperatureAlarm";if="ha1.wadl#parameter.threshold"
   </pwr>;rt="PowerConsumption";if="em2.wadl#meter.power",
   </pwr/thr>;rt="PowerAlarm";if="em2.wadl#parameter.threshold"

   If the network is dedicated to a specific application profile it is
   acceptable to omit the reference to the WADL description which is
   supposed to be known out-of-band.  Web links may have the following
   format:

   REQ: GET /.well-known/core
   RES: 2.00 OK
   </tmp>;rt="AirTemperature";if="sensor.temperature",
   </thr>;rt="TemperatureAlarm";if="parameter.threshold"

4.2.  Description of query parameters

   A typical usage of WADL is to provide a detailed description of how a
   client can build the query string component of a URI to access a
   parametrized resource.  Below is an example that describes how a
   client can select the unit for a temperature sensor.

4.3.  Interface description and associated semantic

   The same interface description can often be reused for similar but
   distinct concepts.  For example a temperature sensor may be able to
   produce the traditional air temperature but also the effective
   temperature which is a combination of air temperature and wind speed.
   Then the definition in Figure 3 is valid for both concepts and the
   device description could look like depicted below.

   REQ: GET /.well-known/core
   RES: 2.00 OK
   </tmp>;rt="DryBulbTemperature";if="sensor.temperature",
   </eff>;rt="EffectiveTemperature";if="sensor.temperature"

4.4.  Collection of resources

   Repeating an interface definition attribute with the same identifier
   for a collection of resources is especially inefficient and laborious
   with link format.  Hopefully WADL supports templated path definitions
   to describe sub-resources.  The template style of parameters allows
   an interface designer to specify the dynamic path elements of a URI
   thanks to a curly brace notation.  It is also possible to precisely
   determine the data type associated to a variable path element.  Below
   is an example of how a list of pending alarms can be described with
   this feature.
