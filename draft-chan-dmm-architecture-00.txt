  A architecture of distributed mobility management using mip and pmip
                     draft-chan-dmm-architecture-00

Abstract

   This draft proposes a distributed architecture of mobility management
   in terms of abstracted logical functions.  Mobility management
   functions are abstracted into different logical functions: (1)
   allocation of home network prefixes or home addresses to mobile
   nodes; (2) location management which includes managing the IP
   addresses and locations of the mobile nodes; and (3) mobility routing
   which includes intercepting and forwarding packets.  A distributed
   architecture can be contructed by providing the mobility routing
   functions in multiple networks in the data plane and a distributed
   database is used to host the location management function.  This
   generalized architecture enables different distributed mobility
   designs using primarily the existing mobility protocols (MIP and
   PMIP) and their extensions.  Several existing distributed mobility
   management proposals are briefly reviewed using this framework.  It
   is expected that the different proposals, when expressed in terms of
   the generalized framework of logical functions, can interwork with
   each other as well as with the existing hierarchical deployments.

1.  Introduction

   The family of Mobile IP [RFC6275] protocols, including Proxy mobile
   IP [RFC5213] and various variants of Mobile IP separate session
   identifier and routing address into a home address and a care-of-
   address respectively and supports mobility with a mobility anchor or
   home agent in the home network.  By routing via the anchor in the
   home network, triangle routing is encountered when a mobile node is
   far from the anchor while being much closer to its correspondent
   node.

   Centralized mobility management has naturally been used in existing
   hierarchical networks, distributed mobility management appears more
   compatible with the flattened networks.  While there are research on
   new protocols for distributed mobility management it has also been
   proposed, e.g., in [Paper-Distributed.Mobility.PMIP] and in many
   other publications, that distributed mobility management can be
   designed using primarily the existing mobility management protocols.
   It will then be helpful to be able to use the same distributed
   mobility management tools in both a distributed and a centralized
   manner and to achieve distributed mobility in both the hierarchical
   network and the flattened network.  Evolution path and compatibility
   with different deployments may then be less of a challenge.

   [I-D.dmm-approaches] has also suggested that a framework using mainly
   the existing mobility protocols and extensions may provide the needed
   solutions and expected that architecture work rather than protocol
   work is needed.  This draft proposes such a generic architectural
   framework to deploy distributed mobility, which also embodies some
   other proposed designs.  If also describes another design of
   distributed mobility management.

1.1.  Overview

   Session 3 proposes to decouple the logical functions of a local
   mobility anchor into that of home address allocation, location
   management, and mobility routing.  Such decoupling enables separation
   between the data plane and the control plane, and enables flexibility
   for the implementation to place the logical functions at their most
   appropriate locations.  When using MIP, PMIP, and their extensions,
   the logical functions are a decomposition or classification of the
   functions of these existing mobility protocols.  Yet it provides a
   framework upon which different designs of distributed mobility may be
   constructed.

   Session 4 describes how to put the logical functions into a
   distributed architecture.  In a distributed architecture, the
   mobility routing function may be present in many geographical

   locations to support dynamic mobility management and to route more
   directly to avoid triangle routing in the data plane.  However, the
   internetwork location management function may be kept only at the
   network where the mobile node is running a session using the IP
   address allocated from that network.  The individual location
   management information for a specific mobile node may be acquired
   whenever needed (Session 4.1).

   The architectural framework enables distributed mobility management
   addressing the issues in centralized mobility management (Session
   4.2).  It can be used for both client-based and network-based Mobile
   IP (Session 4.3).

   Session 5 explains that the distributed architecture in terms of the
   logical functions enables dynamic mobility management.  Several other
   proposals of dynamic mobility management can be considered as
   different designs as welll as filling in any protocol gaps when
   needed.

   Besides achieving dynamic mobility management, one can also take
   advantage of the distributed architecture to avoid unnecessarily long
   routes in the data plane.  Such mechanisms are explained in Session
   6.  Several different route optimization in distributed mobility
   management are reviewed as different designs in terms of a common
   framework, even though they may use different terminologies.  For
   example, the extension of MAG at an access router to include mobility
   anchor function is basically an access router with the logical
   function of mobility routing.  Another draft previously submitted to
   the netext WG, [I-D.distributed-lma], had discussed route
   optimization but with a somewhat different mechanism in terms of
   receiving, sending, handover, and other scenarios.  In the 00 version
   of this draft, the route optimization mechanisms is explained in
   terms of the reachability of the MN only but can be expanded in
   future.

   A route optimization design as well as the above framework is
   explained in [Paper-Distributed.Mobility.Management].  This design is
   reproduced in Session 7 of this draft.

   Part of the contents of this draft are taking from another draft
   previously submitted to the netext wg but with a different design.
   It is expected that expressing different designs in terms of the
   logical functions of a common framework not only provides flexibility
   but may enable interworking between the different designs as well as
   with the existing centralized deployment.  The other draft
   [I-D.distributed-lma] explains how the distributed design can
   interwork with the existing centralized designs of MIP and PMIP.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

2.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the general mobility-related terms and their acronyms used in
   this document are to be interpreted as defined in the Mobile IPv6
   base specification [RFC6275] and in the Proxy mobile IPv6
   specification [RFC5213].  These terms include mobile node (MN),
   correspondent node (CN), home agent (HA), local mobility anchor
   (LMA), and mobile access gateway (MAG).

   In addition, this draft introduces the following terms.

   Mobility routing  (MR) is the logical function to intercept packets
      to/from the HoA of a mobile node and to forward the packets, based
      on the internetwork location information, either to the
      destination or to some other network element that knows how to
      forward to the destination.
   Home address allocation  is the logical function to allocate the home
      network prefix or home address to a mobile node.
   Location management  (LM) is the logical function to manage and keep
      track of the internetwork location information of a mobile node,
      which include a mapping of the HoA of the MN to the routing
      address of the MN or another network element that knows how to
      forward packets towards the MN.
   Home network of an application session (or an HoA IP address)  (LM)
      is the network that has allocated the IP address used as the
      session identifier (HoA) by the application being run in an MN.
      Because a MN may run multiple applications each using a different
      HoA, the notion of the home network may be generalized to that of
      an application session rather than that of a MN.


3.  Logical functions of mobility management

   We decouple the mobility management functions into the following
   logical functions to allow a more flexible design to achieve DMM:

   1.  allocation of home network prefix or HoA to a MN that registers
       with the network;

Internet-Draft              DMM-Architecture                  March 2012


   2.  internetwork location management (LM) function: managing and
       keeping track of the internetwork location of a MN, which include
       a mapping of the HoA to the mobility anchoring point that the MN
       is anchored to; and

   3.  mobility routing (MR) function: intercepting packets to/from the
       HoA of the MN and forwarding the packets, based on the
       internetwork location information, either to the destination or
       to some other network element that knows how to forward to the
       destination.

   Mobile IP and Proxy mobile IP bundle all these three mobility
   management functions into the home agent or mobility anchor.  When
   all these logical functions are bundled into one single entity known
   as the home agent in Mobile IP and as the local mobility anchor in
   Proxy Mobile IP, having this anchor in only one network results in
   triangle routing as shown in Figure 1.

   Figure 1.  Figure showing the triangle routing problem with a MN and
   a CN in networks which may be close to each other but are far from
   the anchor points (LMA or HA).

   A method to solve the triangle routing problem is to duplicate the
   anchor points in many networks (Figure 2) in different geographic
   locations.  In [GHAHA], these anchor points (home agents) announce
   the same IP prefixes using anycast.  The traffic originating from the
   mobile node will then be served by the nearest anchor point, and the
   traffic sent from a correspondent node to the mobile node will be
   intercepted by the anchor point nearest to the correspondent node.
   Therefore both traffic will use the anchor point nearest to where the
   traffic originates, so that triangle routing is avoided.  These
   anchor points may possess identical information about the mobile
   nodes [Paper-Migrating.Home.Agents].  Yet the synchronization of all
   the home agents will then be a challenge [Paper-SMGI].  In addition,
   the amount of signaling traffic needed in synchronizing the home
   agents may become excessive when the number of mobile nodes and the
   number of home agents both increase.

   Figure 2.  Figure showing the replication of mobility anchors in
   multiple networks.

   Decoupling the functions of the anchoring point into the logical
   functions allow more flexibility.  As illustrated in Figure 3, having
   the mobility routing (MR) function available in multiple networks
   will solve the triangle routing problem.  It is also evident that the
   network which has allocated the HoA of an MN may also manage the
   internetwork location information of the MN.  Yet pushing this
   internetwork location management (LM) information to all the other
   networks may be an overkill, especially when the mobile node does not
   always actually communicate with any CNs in many other networks.
   Keeping the location management function at the home network of the
   HoA will eliminate the need to synchronize the location management
   information in a timely and scalable manner.  Each network may then
   maintain the location management information of the HoA for which it
   has allocated the home network prefix.  The different such
   information servers in different networks may work together to
   constitute a distributed database.  That is, the data in each server
   of the distributed database need not be pushed to all the other
   servers but the database system only needs to know which data resides
   in which server.

   in the network that has allocated the network prefix of the HoA.


4.  A distributed architecture of mobility management

4.1.  Multiple MRs and distributed LM database

   The different use case scenarios of distributed mobility management
   are described in [I-D.dmm-scenario] as well as in [Paper-
   Distributed.Mobility.Review].  The architecture describes in this
   draft is mainly on separating the data plane and the control plane.

   Fig. 4 shows an architecture of DMM.  The figure shows, as an
   example, three networks.  Each network has its own IP prefix
   allocation function which is not explicitly shown in the figure.  In
   the data plane, the mobility routing function is distributed to
   multiple locations at the MRs so that routing can be optimized.  In
   the control plane, the MRs may signal with each other, and the LM
   function is a distributed database, with multiple servers, of the
   mapping of HoA to CoA.

   Figure 4.  A distributed architecture of mobility management.

   To perform mobility routing, the MRs need the location information
   which is maintained at the LMs.  The MRs are therefore the clients of
   the LM servers and may also send location updates to the LM as the
   MNs perform handover.  The location information may either be pulled
   from the LM servers by the MR or pushed to the MR by the LM servers.
   In addition, the MR may also cache a limited amount of location
   information.

   This figure shows three MRs (MR1, MR2, and MR3) in three networks.
   MN11 has moved from the first network supported by MR1 and LM1 to the
   third network supported by MR3 and LM3.  It may use an HoA (HoA11)
   allocated to it when it was in the first network for those
   application sessions that had already started when MN11 was attached
   there and that require session continuity after handover to the third
   network.  When MN11 was in the first network, no location management
   is needed so that LM1 will not keep an entry of HoA11 thereby partly
   addressing the problem 5 in Session 3 on wasting resources to support
   MNs not needing mobility support.  After MN11 has performed handover
   to the third network, the database server LM1 keeps a mapping of

   HoA11 to MR3.  That is, it points to the third network and it is the
   third network that will keep track of how to reach MN11.  Such an
   hierarchical of mapping can avoid frequent update signaling to LM1 as
   MN11 performs intra-network handover within the third network.  In
   other words, the concept of hierarchical mobile IP [RFC5380] is
   applied here but only in location management and not in routing in
   the data plane.

4.2.  Against the issues of centralized mobility

   The desired architecture of distributed mobility management should
   enable solutions to address the issues of centralized mobility
   management such as those explained in [Paper-
   Distributed.Mobility.Review].  The distributed architecture is
   examined against the issues of centralized deployment of mobile IP as
   follows:

   1.  Non-optimized routes especially with content delivery network
       (CDN) servers moved closer to the user:

       The architecture has multiple MRs so that an MR is available in
       each network enables avoiding the non-optimal routes in the data
       plane.

   2.  Non-optimality in evolved network architecture:

       These MRs can be implemented in any network so that an MR can be
       closer to the access network to which an MNs is attached.  Such
       an architecture can support the more flattened networks and the
       CDN networks.

   3.  low scalabiltiy of centralized route and mobility context
       maintenance:

       The distributed architecture is more scalable than a centralized
       one, as is discussed in [Paper-Distributed.Centralized.Mobility].

   4.  Single point of failure and attack:

       This problem is mitigated in a distributed database design with
       multiple servers.  In addition, the availability of multiple
       servers is compatible with a system to use neighboring servers to
       backup the location information of each other.

   5.  Wasting resources to support mobile nodes which are not actively
       needing mobility support.

       Dynamic mobility management to be discussed in the next session

       will avoid providing mobility support when no application is
       using the HoA.


4.3.  DMM for MIP versus DMM for PMIP

   MIP and PMIP both employ the same concept of separating session
   identifier and routing address into the HoA and CoA respectively.
   Figure 5 compares (a) MIP and (b) PMIP by showing the destination IP
   address in the network-layer header as a packet traverses from a CN
   to an MN.

   sent from the CN and tunneled to the MAG showing the destination IP
   address as the packet traverses from the CN to the MN.

   The comparison shows that, as far as the data-plane traffic is
   concerned, the route from CN to MN in MIP is similar to the route
   from CN to MAG in PMIP.  The difference is only in replacing the MN
   in MIP with the MAG-MN combination.  Therefore, the distributed
   architecture using MIP can be adapted to the architecture using PMIP
   by replacing the MN with the MAG-MN combination.

   The DMM architecture shown in Figure 4 therefore applies equally well
   to both host-based and network-based mobility management.  The
   difference in the network-based mobility management is in inserting a
   proxy function between the MR and the MN, and this function may be
   located at the access router which then becomes the mobile access
   gateway as that defined in PMIP.

5.  Dynamic mobility management

   The above distributed architecture, which has an MR and an HoA
   allocation function in each network, enables dynamic mobility
   management.

   When new applications are started after moving to a new network, the
   device can simply use a new IP address allocated by the new network.
   Dynamic mobility management, i.e., invoking mobility management only
   when needed, has been proposed in [Paper-
   Distributed.Dynamic.Mobility].

   [I-D.dmm-dma] describes the dynamic mobility management using PMIP.
   There the MR, LM, and the HoA allocation functions are co-located at
   the access router in a flattened network.

   [Paper-Net.based.DMM], or equivalently the draft [I-D.dmm-pmip], also
   describes dynamic mobility management in which the MR and the HoA
   allocation function are both co-located at the access router whereas
   the LM information in each of these access routers are linked
   together under the hierarchy of a centralized LM server.

   [I-D.dmm-armip] again describes dynamic mobility management in which
   the MR and the HoA allocation function are both co-located at the
   access router.

   The distributed mobility architecture compared with a centralized
   approach is more convenient to achieve dynamic mobility management.
   In Fig. 6 above, the LM function and the IP address allocation
   function may communicate with each other or may co-locate.  The
   device MN11 may simply be using a dynamic IP address which is leased
   from the network with a finite lifetime of say 24 hours.  As MN11
   leaves the first network and attaches to the third network, it may or
   may not have ongoing sessions requiring session continuity.  If it
   does not, there is no need for LM1 to keep the binding.  If it does,
   it may use the existing MIP signaling mechanism so that the LM1 will
   keep the binding HoA11:MR3.  When all the ongoing sessions requiring
   session continuity have terminated, it is possible for MN11 to
   deregister with LM1.  Yet one may not assume the device will always
   perform the de-registration.  Alternatively the lease of the dynamic
   IP address HoA11 will expire upon which LM1 will remove the binding.

   In the event that the ongoing session outlives the lease of the
   HoA11, MN11 will need to renew the lease with the IP address
   allocation function in the first network.

5.1.  Home network of an application session

   Because a MN may run multiple applications each using a different IP
   address, there can be multiple HoAs belong to different networks.
   Therefore the notion of home network may be generalized to that of an
   application session or the IP address used by that session as an HoA.
   Then the home network of an application session is simply the network
   that has allocated the IP address used as the session identifier
   (HoA) by the application run in an MN.


6.  Route optimization mechanisms

   The distributed architecture has already enabled dynamic mobility
   management, as is described in [I-D.dmm-dma], even when the routes
   are not optimized.  Route optimization mechanism can be achieved in
   addition to dynamic mobility.

   With the above architecture, there are a number of ways to enable
   reachability of an MN by packets sent from a CN using the mobility
   routing function.

   The target to avoid unnecessarily long route is the direct route
   instead of a triangular route.  In general, when a packet is sent
   from a CN in one network to a MN in another network, the direct route
   consists of the following 3 routing segments (RS):

   RS1.CN-MR(CN):  the route segment from the CN to the nearest MR;

   RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN):  the route segment from the MR serving (and
      therefore being closest to) the CN to the MR serving the MN; and

   RS3.MR(MN)-MN:  the route segment from the MR serving the MN to the
      MN.

   One may therefore examine the route optimization mechanism in terms
   of these 3 routing segments.  In the first segment RS1:CN-MR(CN), the
   alternatives are:

   RS1.CN-MR(CN).anycast:  Use anycast to route the packet to the
      nearest MR function.  Here, each MR includes all the HoAs in its
      route announcement as if each of them is the destination for the
      HoA.  Such route announcements will affect the routing table such
      that the packet destined to an HoA will be routed to the nearest
      MR.  The use of anycast to reach the nearest HA has been used in
      [Paper-Migrating.Home.Agents] but with a different distributed
      architecture of duplicating many HAs.  It is again proposed in
      [Paper-Distributed.Mobility.PMIP].

Internet-Draft              DMM-Architecture                  March 2012


   RS1.CN-MR(CN).gw/ar:  Co-locate the MR function at a convenient
      location to which the packet will always pass.  Such locations may
      be the gateway router or the access router.  This approach will be
      described later.
      It is noted here that in PMIP design in a hierchical network,
      generally, the MAG is at the access router but LMA can be in the
      gateway router of a network.  Whether a distributed mobility
      design enhances the MAG or the LMA may involve quite different
      mechanisms.  Yet when looking at the logical function, it is
      basically the same MR function whether this function co-locates
      with the access router or the gateway router.  This draft
      therefore put both approaches together.  There is however a
      difference that the access router needs to perform proxying
      function when using PMIP.  Yet the logical MR functions are the
      same.
      It is again noted that in flattened network, the access router and
      the gatway router may merge together.  With they are merged, the
      needed function is again the same logical MR function.

   In the second segment RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN), the alternatives are:

   RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).query:  The MR query the LM database and use the
      result to tunnel the packet to the MR serving the MN.  In order
      words, the MR pulls the needed internetwork location information
      from the LM server.  There will be a delay owing to the time taken
      to send this query and to receive the reply.  Optionally, before
      receiving the reply, the first packet or the first few packets may
      be forwarded using mip or pmip.  Then the first packet may incur a
      triangle route rather than to wait for the query reply.  After
      receiving the reply, the packet will be tunneled to the MR(MN).
      The result may be cached for forwarding subsequent packets.

   RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).push:  The MR routes the first packet to the home
      network using the existing MIP or PMIP mechanism.  It will then be
      intercepted by the MR of the MN which, with the help of LM, knows
      whether the MN has moved to a different network and use the
      mapping in LM to tunnel the packet to the MR of the MN.  Then the
      MR of the MN will inform MR of the CN to tunnel the packet
      directly to the MR of the MN in future.  In order words, after
      MR(CN) has forwarded the first packet to MR(MN), the MR(MN) is
      triggered to push the location information to MR(CN).  The MR of
      the CN may keep this information in its cache memory for
      forwarding subsequent packets.

   In the final segment RS3.MR(MN)-MN, the MR may keep track of the
   location of MN and route to it using its intra-network mobility
   management mechanism.

   Different designs using the above architecture can be made by taking
   different combinations of the different designs in the different
   route segments.  For example, the overall design of DMM may be:

   1.  RS1.CN-MR(CN).anycast followed by RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).query:

   2.  RS1.CN-MR(CN).anycast followed by RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).push:

       An example is [Paper-Distributed.Mobility.PMIP] which is
       explained for network-based mobile IP but is also applicable to
       host-based mobile IP.

   3.  RS1.CN-MR(CN).gw/ar followed by RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).query:

       An example is in [I-D.dmm-pmip-based] in which the MR function is
       co-located at the MAG which is usually at the access router.
       Here, when CN is also a MN using PMIP, the packet sent from it
       naturally goes to the access router which takes the logical
       function of MR so that it will query the LM, which resides in the
       LMA.  It then uses the query result to tunnel the packet to the
       MR(MN), which resides in the AR/MAG of the destination MN.  The
       signaling flow and other details are described in the referenced
       draft.

       Another example is in [Paper-PMIP.dmc].  In the signal driven
       approach, the MR is co-located the access router, which is
       considered as an extension of MAG.  The MR, i.e., the extended
       MAG, serving the CN queries the LM and cache the result so that
       it can tunnel packets to the MR serving the destination MN.

       [I-D.dmm-nat-phl] also colocates the MR at the gateways.  The
       gateway which serves the network of transmitting node and where
       the MR is colocated is called the Ingress router, whereas that at
       the network of the MN at the receiving side is called egress
       router.  Instead of tunneling between these 2 gateways, header
       rewrite using NAT is used to forward the packet through the
       internetwork route segment.

   4.  RS1.CN-MR(CN).gw/ar followed by RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).push:

       Another example will be described in the next Section.


7.  Co-locating MR at gateway or access router

   The mechanism of co-locating MR at the gateway and routing the first
   packet to the home network using existing MIP/PMIP mechanism is
   explained further here.

   When the first packet is sent from a correspondent node CN21 to the
   home address HoA11 of the mobile node MN11, it first arrives at GW2.
   GW2 does not find any location information of the MN and therefore
   sends the packet to GW1 in accordance with routing table with the IP
   prefix of HoA11.  If the MN is in the network served by GW1, the
   packet will be forwarded to MN11.  In this case shown in the figure,

   MN11 has moved to the network served by GW3, and LM1 contains the
   binding of HoA11 to the IP address of GW3.  GW1 therefore tunnels the
   packet to GW3.  GW3 contains the binding HoA to AR32 and therefore
   tunnels the packet to AR32 which in turn delivers the packet to MN11.

   Meanwhile based on the source IP address of the packet, GW1 finds out
   that the packet had come from GW2.  It informs GW2 to cache the
   binding HoA11 to GW3.  When subsequent packets to MN11 reach GW2, GW2
   finds out from its cache memory this binding so that it will tunnel
   these subsequent packets directly to GW3 (Figure 7. ).
