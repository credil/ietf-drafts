         Multicast LDP extension for hub & spoke multipoint LSP
                 draft-jin-jounay-mpls-mldp-hsmp-04.txt

Abstract

   This draft introduces a hub & spoke multipoint LSP (short for HSMP
   LSP), which allows traffic both from root to leaf through P2MP LSP
   and also leaf to root along the co-routed reverse path.  That means
   traffic entering the HSMP LSP from application/customer at the root
   node travels downstream, exactly as if it was traveling downstream
   along a P2MP LSP to each leaf node, and traffic entering the HSMP LSP
   at any leaf node travels upstream along the tree to the root.  A
   packet traveling upstream should be thought of as being unicast to
   the root, except that it follows the path of the tree rather than
   ordinary unicast path.

Internet-Draft       draft-jin-jounay-mpls-mldp-hsmp         August 2011


1.  Introduction

   The point-to-multipoint LSP defined in [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp]
   allows traffic to transmit from root to several leaf nodes, and
   multipoint-to-multipoint LSP allows traffic from every node to
   transmit to every other node.  This draft introduces a hub & spoke
   multipoint LSP (short for HSMP LSP), which allows traffic both from
   root to leaf through P2MP LSP and also leaf to root along the co-
   routed reverse path.  That means traffic entering the HSMP LSP at the
   root node travels downstream, exactly as if it was traveling
   downstream along a P2MP LSP, and traffic entering the HSMP LSP at any
   other node travels upstream along the tree to the root.  A packet
   traveling upstream should be thought of as being unicast to the root,
   except that it follows the path of the tree rather than ordinary
   unicast path.


2.  Applications

   In some cases, the P2MP LSP may not have a reply path for the OAM
   message (e.g, LSP Ping).  If P2MP LSP is provided by HSMP LSP, then
   the upstream path could be exactly used as the OAM message reply
   path.  This is especially useful in the case of P2MP LSP fault
   detection, performance measurement, root node redundancy and etc.
   There are several other applications that could take advantage of
   such kind of LDP based HSMP LSP as described below.

2.1.  Time synchronization

   The delivery of time synchronization to end equipments, such as base
   stations, can be achieved using a time protocol as [IEEE1588v2] (also
   known as PTP).  This protocol defines Transparent Clock (TC)
   function, which can be used in transport nodes to improve the
   accuracy of time synchronization.  Two types of TCs exist in
   [IEEE1588v2]: End-to-end Transparent Clock (E2E TC) and Peer-to-peer
   Transparent Clock (P2P TC).  P2P TCs assume that the link delays
   between the different nodes are calculated.

   Assuming that a chain of P2P TCs is used between a PTP master and a
   PTP slave, time synchronization can be delivered to the PTP slave by
   sending timestamps only in the direction master to slave (one way
   mode), via PTP Sync messages.  This is possible thanks to the link
   delay calculation performed locally by each node, which enable to
   calculate the propagation delay over the path.  This scenario permits
   that the same PTP Sync messages would be sent by the PTP master to
   all the PTP slaves.

   In this scenario (chain of P2P TCs), the PTP slave might have to send

Internet-Draft       draft-jin-jounay-mpls-mldp-hsmp         August 2011


   also messages (not carrying timestamps) back to the PTP master in
   some cases.  For instance, PTP Signaling messages could be sent back
   to the PTP master.  These PTP Signaling messages are not intended to
   be received by the other PTP slaves.

   IEEE1588 over MPLS is defined in [I-D.ietf-tictoc-1588overmpls].  By
   using point-to-multipoint technology to transmit PTP Sync messages
   will greatly improve the bandwidth usage for above applications.
   Unfortunately current point-to-multipoint LSP only provides
   unidirectional path from source to leaf, which cannot fulfill the
   above new requirement (i.e. need for a reverse path for the PTP
   Signaling messages).  The main motivation of this draft is to solve
   the new problem.  LDP based HSMP LSP described in this draft provides
   co-routed reverse path from leaf to root based on current
   unidirectional point-to-multipoint LSP.

   There are two main specific scenarios for timing synchronization
   based on [IEEE1588v2]:1.  HSMP for phase/time delivery with TCKs.2.
   HSMP for phase/time delivery with BCKs.The benefit of using mLDP
   based HSMP LSP here is to provision dynamically the topology.

   Time synchronization is also required for accurate quantification of
   one-way delay as described in [I-D.ietf-mpls-loss-delay].  HSMP LSP
   can be used to do time synchronization based on [IEEE1588v2] with a
   chain of P2P TCs for P2MP LSP or P2MP PW.

2.2.  IPTV scenario

   The mLDP based HSMP LSP can also be applied in a typical IPTV
   scenario.  There is usually only one location with senders but there
   are many receiver locations.  If IGMP is used for signaling between
   senders and receivers, the messages from the receivers are travelling
   only from the leaves to the root (and from root towards leaves) but
   not from leaf to leaf.  In addition traffic from the root is only
   replicated towards the leaves.  Then leaf node receiving IGMP message
   (for SSM case) will join HSMP LSP, and send IGMP message upstream to
   root along HSMP LSP.

2.3.  P2MP PW based L2VPN (VPMS and VPLS)

   Point to multipoint PW described in [I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw] requires
   to setup reverse path from leaf node (referred as egress PE) to root
   node (referred as ingress PE), if HSMP LSP is used to multiplex P2MP
   PW, the reverse path can also be multiplexed to HSMP upstream path to
   avoid setup independent reverse path.  In that case, the operational
   cost will be reduced for maintaining only one HSMP LSP, instead of
   P2MP LSP and n (number of leaf nodes) P2P reverse LSPs.

Internet-Draft       draft-jin-jounay-mpls-mldp-hsmp         August 2011


   The VPMS defined in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpms-frmwk-requirements] requires
   reverse path from leaf to root node.  The P2MP PW multiplexed to HSMP
   LSP can provide VPMS with reverse path, without introducing
   independent reverse path from each leaf to root.

   The P2MP PW multiplexed to HSMP LSP can also be used to VPLS
   [RFC4762], which will reduce the overall broadcast/multicast
   utilization on a VPLS.  In current VPLS implementations with a full
   mesh of P2P PWs between PEs, broadcast, multicast and unknown traffic
   are not efficiently propagated on the physical links between PEs and
   Ps.

   In the VPLS implementation scenario with P2MP PW multiplexed to HSMP
   LSPs, each PE signals a P2MP PW with itself as a root to all other
   PEs in the VPLS.  Thereafter, all broadcast/multicast/unknown traffic
   from this PE will use this P2MP PW multiplexed to HSMP.  Unicast
   traffic from a particular PE (e.g.  PE1) to another PE (e.g.  PE2)
   will be sent from leaf to root using the reverse path of P2MP PW
   where PE2 is the root.

   This simplifies the VPLS implementation by: 1. reducing traffic
   utilization from broadcast, multicast and unknown traffic; 2.
   reducing the total number of LSPs maintained by each PE (i.e. instead
   of requiring a full mesh of PW, now only require one P2MP PW
   multiplexed to HSMP per PE).


3.  Terminology

   mLDP: Multicast LDP.

   P2MP LSP: An LSP that has one Ingress LSR and one or more Egress
   LSRs.

   MP2MP LSP: An LSP that connects a set of nodes, such that traffic
   sent by any node in the LSP is delivered to all others.

   HSMP LSP: hub & spoke multipoint LSP.  An LSP allows traffic both
   from root to leaf through P2MP LSP and also leaf to root along the
   co-routed reverse path.


4.  Setting up HSMP LSP with LDP

   HSMP LSP is similar with MP2MP LSP described in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp], with the difference that the leaf LSRs can
   only send traffic to root node along the same path of traffic from
   root node to leaf node.

   HSMP LSP consists of a downstream path and upstream path.  The
   downstream path is same as MP2MP LSP, while the upstream path is only
   from leaf to root node, without communication between leaf and leaf
   nodes.  The transmission of packets from the root node of a HSMP LSP
   to the receivers is identical to that of a P2MP LSP.  Traffic from a
   leaf node follows the upstream path toward the root node, along the
   identical path of downstream path.

   For setting up the upstream path of a HSMP LSP, ordered mode MUST be
   used which is same as MP2MP.  Ordered mode can guarantee a leaf to
   start sending packets to root immediately after the upstream path is
   installed, without being dropped due to an incomplete LSP.

   Due to much of same behavior between HSMP LSP and MP2MP LSP, the
   following sections only describe the difference between the two
   entities.

4.1.  Support for HSMP LSP setup with LDP

   HSMP LSP also needs the LDP capabilities [RFC5561] to indicate the
   supporting for the setup of HSMP LSPs.  An implementation supporting
   the HSMP LSP procedures specified in this document MUST implement the
   procedures for Capability Parameters in Initialization Messages.
   Advertisement of the HSMP LSP Capability indicates support of the
   procedures for HSMP LSP setup.

   A new Capability Parameter TLV is defined, the HSMP LSP Capability.
   Following is the format of the HSMP LSP Capability Parameter.

   The HSMP LSP capability type is to be assigned by IANA.

4.2.  HSMP FEC Elements

   Similar as MP2MP LSP, we define two new protocol entities, the HSMP
   downstream FEC and upstream FEC Element.  Both elements will be used
   as FEC Elements in the FEC TLV.  The structure, encoding and error
   handling for the HSMP downstream and upstream FEC Elements are the

Internet-Draft       draft-jin-jounay-mpls-mldp-hsmp         August 2011


   same as for the MP2MP FEC Element described in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp] Section 4.2.  The difference is that two
   additional new FEC types are used: HSMP downstream type (TBD, IANA)
   and HSMP upstream type (TBD, IANA).

4.3.  Using the HSMP FEC Elements

   In order to describe the message processing clearly, following
   defines the processing of the HSMP FEC Elements, which is inherited
   from [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp] section 4.3.

   1.  HSMP downstream LSP <X, Y> (or simply downstream <X, Y>): a HSMP
   LSP downstream path with root node address X and opaque value Y.

   2.  HSMP upstream LSP <X, Y> (or simply upstream <X, Y>): a HSMP LSP
   upstream path for root node address X and opaque value Y which will
   be used by any of downstream node to send traffic upstream to root
   node.

   3.  HSMP downstream FEC Element <X, Y>: a FEC Element with root node
   address X and opaque value Y used for a downstream HSMP LSP.

   4.  HSMP upstream FEC Element <X, Y>: a FEC Element with root node
   address X and opaque value Y used for an upstream HSMP LSP.

   5.  HSMP-D Label Map <X, Y, L>: A Label Map message with a single
   HSMP downstream FEC Element <X, Y> and label TLV with label L. Label
   L MUST be allocated from the per-platform label space of the LSR
   sending the Label Map Message.

   6.  HSMP-U Label Map <X, Y, Lu>: A Label Map message with a single
   HSMP upstream FEC Element <X, Y> and label TLV with label Lu.  Label
   Lu MUST be allocated from the per-platform label space of the LSR
   sending the Label Map Message.

4.3.1.  HSMP LSP Label Map

   This section specifies the procedures for originating HSMP Label Map
   messages and processing received HSMP label map messages for a
   particular HSMP LSP.  The procedure of downstream HSMP LSP is same as
   that of downstream MP2MP LSP described in [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp].
   Under the operation of ordered mode, the upstream LSP will be setup
   by sending HSMP LSP mapping message with label which is allocated by
   upstream LSR to its downstream LSR one by one from root to leaf node,
   installing the upstream forwarding table by every node along the LSP.
   Detail procedure of upstream HSMP LSP is different with that of
   upstream MP2MP LSP, and is specified in below section.

Internet-Draft       draft-jin-jounay-mpls-mldp-hsmp         August 2011


   All labels discussed here are downstream-assigned [RFC5332] except
   those which are assigned using the procedures described in section 5.

   Determining the upstream LSR for a HSMP LSP <X, Y> follows the
   procedure for a MP2MP LSP described in [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp]
   Section 4.3.1.1.

   Determining one's downstream HSMP LSR procedure is much same as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp] section 4.3.1.2.  A LDP peer U
   which receives a HSMP-D Label Map from a LDP peer D will treat D as
   downstream HSMP LSR.

   Determining the forwarding interface to an LSR has same procedure as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp] section 2.4.1.2.

4.3.1.1.  HSMP LSP leaf node operation

   The leaf node operation is same as the operation of MP2MP LSP defined
   in [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp] section 4.3.1.4, only with different FEC
   element processing and specified below.

   A leaf node Z will send a HSMP-D Label Map <X, Y, L> to U, instead of
   MP2MP-D Label Map <X, Y, L>. and expects a HSMP-U Label Map <X, Y,
   Lu> from node U and checks whether it already has forwarding state
   for upstream <X, Y>.  The created forwarding state on leaf node Z is
   same as the leaf node of MP2MP LSP.  Z will push label Lu onto the
   traffic that Z wants to forward over the HSMP LSP.

4.3.1.2.  HSMP LSP transit node operation

   Suppose node Z receives a HSMP-D Label Map <X, Y, L> from LSR D, the
   procedure is same as processing MP2MP-D Label Mapping message defined
   in [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp] section 4.3.1.5, and the processing
   protocol entity is HSMP-D label mapping message.  The different
   procedure is specified below.

   Node Z checks if upstream LSR U already assigned a label Lu to
   upstream <X, Y>.  If not, transit node Z waits until it receives a
   HSMP-U Label Map <X, Y, Lu> from LSR U. Once the HSMP-U Label Map is
   received from LSR U, node Z checks whether it already has forwarding
   state upstream <X, Y> with incoming label Lu' and outgoing label Lu.
   If it does, Z sends a HSMP-U Label Map <X, Y, Lu'> to downstream
   node.  If it does not, it allocates a label Lu' and creates a new
   label swap for Lu' with Label Lu over interface Iu.  Interface Iu is
   determined via the procedures in Section 4.3.1.  Node Z determines
   the downstream HSMP LSR as per Section 4.3.1, and sends a HSMP-U
   Label Map <X, Y, Lu'> to node D.

Internet-Draft       draft-jin-jounay-mpls-mldp-hsmp         August 2011


   Since a packet from any downstream node is forwarded only to the
   upstream node, the same label (representing the upstream path) can be
   distributed to all downstream nodes.  This differs from the
   procedures for MPMP LSPs [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp], where a distinct
   label must be distributed to each downstream node.  The forwarding
   state upstream <X, Y> on node Z will be like this {<Lu'>, <Iu Lu>}.
   Iu means the upstream interface over which Z receives HSMP-U Label
   Map <X, Y, Lu> from LSR U. Packets from any downstream interface over
   which Z send HSMP-U Label Map <X, Y, Lu'> with label Lu' will be
   forwarded to Iu with label Lu' swap to Lu.

4.3.1.3.  HSMP LSP root node operation

   Suppose root node Z receives a HSMP-D Label Map <X, Y, L> from node
   D, the procedure is much same as processing MP2MP-D Label Mapping
   message defined in [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp] section 4.3.1.6, and the
   processing protocol entity is HSMP-D label mapping message.  The
   different procedure is specified below.

   Node Z checks if it has forwarding state for upstream <X, Y>.  If
   not, Z creates a forwarding state for incoming label Lu' that
   indicates that Z is the LSP egress.  E.g., the forwarding state might
   specify that the label stack is popped and the packet passed to some
   specific application.  Node Z determines the downstream HSMP LSR as
   per section 4.3.1, and sends a HSMP-U Label Map <X, Y, Lu'> to node
   D.

   Since Z is the root of the tree, Z will not send a HSMP-D Label Map
   and will not receive a HSMP-U Label Map.

4.3.2.  HSMP LSP Label Withdraw

   The HSMP Label Withdraw procedure is much same as MP2MP leaf
   operation defined in [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp] section 4.3.2, and the
   processing protocol entities are HSMP FECs.  The only difference is
   process of HSMP-U label release message, which is specified below.

   When a transit node Z receives a HSMP-U label release message from
   downstream node D, Z should check if there are any incoming interface
   in forwarding state upstream <X, Y>.  If all downstream nodes are
   released and there is no incoming interface, Z should delete the
   forwarding state upstream <X, Y> and send HSMP-U label release

4.3.3.  HSMP LSP upstream LSR change

   The procedure for changing the upstream LSR is the same as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp] section 4.3.3, except it is applied to HSMP

5.  HSMP LSP on a LAN

   The procedure to process P2MP LSP on a LAN has been described in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp].  When the LSR forwards a packet downstream
   on one of those LSPs, the packet's top label must be the "upstream
   LSR label", and the packet's second label is "LSP label".

   When establishing the downstream path of a HSMP LSP, as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-upstream], a label request for a LSP label is send
   to the upstream LSR.  The upstream LSR should send label mapping that
   contains the LSP label for the downstream HSMP FEC and the upstream
   LSR context label.  At the same time, it must also send label mapping
   for upstream HSMP FEC to downstream node.  Packets sent by the
   upstream router can be forwarded downstream using this forwarding
   state based on a two label lookup.  Packets traveling upstream need
   to be forwarded in the direction of the root by using the label
   allocated by upstream LSR.


6.  Redundancy considerations

   In some scenario, it is necessary to provide two root nodes for
   redundancy purpose.  One way to implement this is to use two
   independent HSMP LSPs acting as active/standby.  At one time, only
   one HSMP LSP will be active, and the other will be standby.  After
   detecting the failure of active HSMP LSP, the root and leaf nodes
   will switch the traffic to the new active HSMP LSP which is switched
   from former standby LSP.  The detail of redundancy mechanism will be
   for future study.


7.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations apply as for the MP2MP LSP described
   in [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp].


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires allocation of two new LDP FEC Element types:

   1. the HSMP-upstream FEC type - requested value 0x09

   2. the HSMP-downstream FEC type - requested value 0x10

   This document requires the assignment of new code points for the
   Capability Parameter TLVs, corresponding to the advertisement of the
   HSMP LSP capabilities.  The values requested are:

   HSMP LSP Capability Parameter - requested value 0x050B
