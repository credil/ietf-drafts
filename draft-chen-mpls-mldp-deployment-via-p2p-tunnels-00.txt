Abstract

   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be used to set up Point-to-
   Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched
   Paths.  The existing specification for this functionality assumes
   that a pair of LDP neighbors which support the P2MP/MP2MP capability
   are directly connected.  However, the real deployment may not have
   all the nodes along the LSP path to be P2MP/MP2MP capable so that the
   CapEx of the deployment can be reduced or the deployment of the LDP
   P2MP/MP2MP can be in phases instead of updating the whole network.
   This document provides a solution for finding the first upstream node
   which supports the LDP P2MP/MP2MP along the path from the current
   node to the root node.

Internet-Draft   Deploying mLDP through p2p LSP Tunnels     October 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Specification of requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Motivation

   This document provides a solution to setup LDP's P2MP and MP2MP LSPs
   in a network where where the mLDP LSP passes through nodes which is
   not mLDP capable.

   The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) extensions for setting up
   Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and
   Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs are specified in [mLDP].  This
   set of extensions is generally known as "Multipoint LDP" (mLDP).  The
   term "Multipoint" means "either P2MP or MP2MP" normmally.

   In the deployment scenarios where the service providers wish to
   upgrade their network gradually by only making certain nodes of the
   existing network to be upgraded both on the control plane and
   forwarding plane and for the rest of the network nodes, they only
   require a minor signaling plan change while keeping the forwarding
   plan as same as before.  This will reduce the CapEx for the users who
   doesn't need to update every nodes of their network to support the
   mLDP.

   The base specification for mLDP does not explicitly cover the case
   where the LDP multipoint extensions are used for over a path where
   the transit nodes along path to the root node don't support the mLDP
   capability.

   If LSR D is setting up the MP-LSP <R, X>, D needs to determine the
   "upstream LSR" for <R, X>.  In [mLDP], the upstream LSR for <R, X>,
   U, is defined to be the "next hop" on D's path to root R, and "next
   hop" is tacitly assumed to mean "IGP next hop".  It is thus assumed
   that there is a direct LDP session between D and U. In the deployment
   scenario where the "IGP next hop" may not support the mLLDP fearure.
   In this specification, we specify a p2p tunnel through method which
   identifies an "upstream LSR" which is doesn't have the direct session
   with LSR D, but it is the first node on D's path to root R.

       mLDP deployment issue when some nodes without mLDP capability

                                 Figure 1

   In the figure above, the R4 nodes finds out that the upstream route
   R3 doesn't support mLDP, and there is no other upstream node which R4
   can use as the upstream node to go to Root, then this mLDP LSP shown
   the picture above can not be setup.

   This document specifies a mechanism for deploying the mLDP with the
   nodes supporting mLDP completely in the control plane and also in the
   forwarding plan mixed with the nodes which dont support the mLDP but
   can propagate the notification message toward the root until it finds
   the node which supports the mLDP.  Both the protocol extensions and
   processing procedures are specified in this documents.

   In the figure above, when the R4 find out that the upstream route R3
   support the mLDP in a p2p tunneled mode, and the R4 sends out the
   lapping mapping in a p2p tunnel format, and when the R3 receives this
   label mapping message, it will pass up this message to is upstream
   router R1.  When R1 receives this able mapping message, it will setup
   one p2p tunnels which will make the R4 to chose R1 as the next hop to
   root for mLDP LSP setup.

   In the figure above, when the R6 and find out that the upstream
   router R4 supports the mLDP in a p2p tunneled mode, and the R4 is
   already in the tunnel mode for the mLDP LSP, then R6 will setup
   another p2p tunnel between R6 and R3.  In this case, R3 will become
   the branch node for this mLDP LSP, where the outgoing two branches
   are implemented using two p2p tunnels.

2.1.  The signaling procedures for deploying mLDP through p2p tunnels

   o  If LSR D is setting up the MP-LSP <R, X>, D finds out that the
      direct connected "upstream LSR" for <R, X> is not supporting mLDP.

   o  The node D find the upstream node supporting mLDP in p2p
      tunneling-through mode capability from the upstream node for mLDP
      capability advertisement.

   o  The node D send an notification message to this upstream node with
      its local LSR-ID and mLDP LSP's root node IP address.

   o  The next hop node sends an notification message to its upstream
      node until it reaches the node which support the full mLDP
      capability.

   o  The fist node which has mLDP full capability receives this
      notification will setup LDP target LDP sessions with the the node
      D identified by the LSR-ID in the notification message.  And at
      the same time, this first node tells that the node D identified by

      the LSR-ID to chose this first node as the upstream router for the
      mLDP LSP setup.

   o  Once the node with the LSR-ID receives this notification from the
      first node, it will setup the mLDP lsp as its upstream node to the
      root of the mLDP.

2.2.  Protocol extensions for deploying mLDP through p2p tunnels

   A new type of LDP MP Status Value Element is introduced, for
   notifying upstream LSRs and about the LSR-ID and the root of the
   mLDP.  The MP status element can use what defined in the draft of
   draft-mpls-ldp-p2mp-15 by adding two more element types, one of them
   is used to identify the root node address of the mLDP and another is
   used for identifying the LSR which needs the p2p tunnel to setup the
   mLDP lsp.  It is encoded as follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3
