1.  Introduction

   The mobile network has been evolved from 2G, 3G and now the 4G
   network is being deployed by many operators.  Traditionally, the
   mobile core network equipment is dedicated telecom equipment, many of
   them are based on dedicated hardware platform, e.g. CPCI.  The core
   network equipment's software is normally tightly coupled with the
   hardware.  This purpose of this dedicate hardware and software
   integrated approach is to achieve telecom level high performance and
   high reliability.  But the consequence of this design approach is the
   lack of flexibility of the network.  Current mobile network is facing
   the challenge of the booming of the mobile Internet.  The mobile
   network not only facing the very fast increasing of the data traffic
   and also have to face the challenge from OTT applications.  Those
   challenges require the mobile core network having more flexibilitys.
   This document proposes a cloud based mobile network architecture to
   meet those challenges.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  The motivation for cloud based mobile core network

   Current mobile network is facing the following challenge:

   1.  The fast increasing of the data traffic.  According to Cisco's
   visual networking prediction,the mobile Internet traffic will
   increase 66% CAGR from 2012 to 2017.  Such high volume of data
   traffic will not only put a lot of pressure to the wireless access
   network side but also give a lot of challenge to the mobile core
   network side.  For example, in current mobility management
   architecture, both the Mobile IP protocol developed by IETF and the
   GTP protocol developed by 3GPP share a common idea that there will be
   one or more IP anchoring points that maintain the home address of the
   mobile node and its topological routable IP address.  The fast
   increasing of the mobile data traffic will give much pressure to the
   mobile anchor point.  IETF DMM working group was formed to tackle
   this problem by distributing of the anchor point.  A more radical
   approach is that there is no anchoring point in the network, it will
   relay on the routing system or SDN to take care of the mobility
   management.

   2.  The lack of flexibility of network functionality.  Although the
   telecom industry is trying to decouple the service and the network
   but we still can see that in current mobile network architecture it
   is very difficult to deploy a new service or upgrade the network's
   capability.  Since currently, most of the mobile core equipment is
   build on the CPCI hardware platform and the software normally tightly
   coupled with the hardware platform.  It is very difficult to change
   or upgrade the network equipment's functionality in an agile way.  On
   the other hand, the mobile operators want to provide more intelligent
   and value added service other than to be a just dumb pipe providers.
   That will also require the mobile core network has the flexibility.

   3.  The lack of flexibility of service deployment.  When the operator
   wants to deploy a new service, it is needed to make the network
   upgrade plan carefully and need to do the trial deployment in a small
   area to guaranty that the new service and network upgrading will not
   affect the production network.  The whole process of a new service to
   be deployed normally takes several months even years.

   4.  The challenge of reducing the CAPEX and OPEX cost.  The mobile
   operators need to lower both the CAPEX and the OPEX of their network,

   especially when they are facing the fast increasing of the data
   traffic.  Dedicated hardware and tightly coupled software also makes
   the CAPEX and OPEX at a high level.

   In this architecture, the mobile core network is located in the cloud
   /data center.  That could be the operator's private cloud.  The
   access network is connected to the mobile core network through IP
   transmit network.  The mobile core network could run in a virtualized
   platform in the cloud/datacenter.

5.  Problem statement of cloud based mobile core architecture

5.1.  Control and data plane separation

   The cloud based mobile core network architecture implies the
   separation of the control and data plane.  The control plane is
   located in the cloud and the data plane should be distributed.
   Otherwise, all the data traffic will go through to the cloud which is
   obviously not optimized for the mobile node to mobile node
   communication.

   For the mobile node to Internet communication, the Internet access
   point normally is located in the metro IP transmit network.  In this
   case, the mobile node to Internet traffic should also go through from
   the Internet access point instead of go to the mobile core in the
   cloud.

   However, in some deployment scenario, the operator may choose to put
   the mobile core cloud in the convergency layer of IP metro network.
   In this case, the Internet access point may co-located with the
   mobile core cloud.  In this case, the mobile node to Internet traffic
   may go through the mobile core cloud.

5.2.  Mobility management

   Since the control plane and data plane are separated and the data
   plane is distributed, traditional mobility management can not meet
   this requirement.

   Distributed mobility management or SDN based mobility management may
   be used in this architecture to meet the traffic routing requirement
   (e.g. MN to MN and MN to Internet traffic should not go through from
   the mobile core cloud.).

5.3.  Network slicing

   Network slicing is a technology that can 'slice' a physical network
   into different pieces.  Each piece is logically independent from each
   other.  One example of network slicing technology is FlowVisor.
   FlowVisor [FlowVisor] is based on open flow protocol, multiple open
   flow controller could be connected to the FlowVisor and the FlowVisor
   connect to the physical switches.  The FlowVisor can translate the

   flow control command from the controller above the FlowVisor in to
   the flow control command specific to the network slice that allocated
   to this controller.  For example, in figure 2, from controller A's
   perspective, it believes that it has the full control of all the
   physical network.  Also from controller B's perspective, it also
   believe that it has the full control of all the physical network.
   Multiple controllers do not interfere from each other.By this way,
   multiple controller can share the same physical network and the
   physical network is sliced into multiple pieces.


                  +----------+    +----------+   +----------+
            |Controller|    |Controller|   |Controller|
            |    A     |    |    B     |   |    C     |
            +----------+    +----------+   +----------+
                   |             |               |
            +-----------------------------------------+
            |                                         |
            |              Flow Visor                 |
            |                                         |
            +-----------------------------------------+
                                |
            +-----------------------------------------+
            |                                         |
            |           Physical Network              |
            |                                         |
            +-----------------------------------------+


   Figure 2: FlowVisor

   Network slicing can provide a flexible network capability for the
   operator.  For example, the operator can deploy a new service in a
   new network slice without worry about affecting the production
   network's service.

   FlowVisor is only one example for network slicing and network
   virtualization.  Furthermore, how to combine network slicing and
   mobility management in the cloud based mobile core architecture is an
   important topic need to be further studied.

5.4.  Network auto-configuration

   Network auto-configuration is a way to simplify the network operation
   and reduce the network OPEX.  In an ideal case, the mobile access
   network should be registered automatically to the mobile core network
   without manual configuration.  IETF has defined CAPWAP for wireless
   access point control and configuration.  However, how to keep the

   auto-configuration protocol compatible with existing mobile network
   protocols need to be further studied.

6.  Conclusion

   This document discusses the motivation and challenges of the cloud
   based mobile core network.  There are several key points that need to
   be further studied by the community.

   1.  Innovative mobility management scheme that fulfils with the
   distributed data plane traffic routing and network slicing
   requirement.

   2.  Network slicing.  FlowVisor is one example of network slicing
   technology that based on openflow.  Further study should be made
   regarding how to virtualize the mobile core network.

   3.  Network auto-configuration.  How to define a mobile network auto-
   configuration protocol while keeps the backward compatibility with
   current mobile network need to be further studied.

7.  Security Considerations

   Security should be studied when design the cloud based mobile core
   network.
