1. Introduction

   The Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3), which is defined in RFC
   1939 [RFC1939], is an application-layer protocol used by local e-mail
   clients to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a simple TCP/IP
   connection.  It supports simple download-and-delete requirements for
   access to remote mailboxes (also called a maildrop).

   As POP3 is employed to transfer sensitive information, there is a
   need for privacy protection.  Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [RFC5246] (and its predecessor Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) [RFC6101])
   are commonly used for this purpose. 

   Two ways of protecting POP3 with TLS have been deployed (like 2 ways
   of securing HTTP [RFC2616]; see below).  The first includes
   establishing TLS layer connection during the POP3 transaction (also
   known as upgrading to TLS) [RFC2595].  The other one involves
   establishing TLS connection directly before establishing POP3
   transaction.  Unlike the former, this way (called "POP3S" throughout
   this document) has not been previously specified in an RFC.  (In the
   case with HTTP the first way is specified in RFC 2817 [RFC2817]; the
   second one - in RFC 2818 [RFC2818].)

   This document specifies POP3S.  It updates RFC 2595 [RFC2595] (see
   Section 2.5 for justification).  This memo also updates the

   registration of the TCP well-known port 995, used with POP3S.

   RFC 6186 [RFC6186] specifies the way to use DNS SRV records [RFC2782]
   for locating information about email access services.  It supports
   both POP3S and the aforementioned POP3 upgraded to TLS.  For more
   information, refer to Section 3.3 of RFC 6186. 

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
   Terminology from RFC 1939 [RFC1939] is used in this document.

   The "POP3S transaction" refers to the POP3 transaction established as
   described in Section 2.1.

2. POP3 over TLS Protocol

   This section contains the technical definition of POP3 over TLS
   protocol (POP3S).

2.1. Connection Establishment and User Authentication

   This section describes how to establish POP3S transaction.

   First, the client first establishes the TCP connection [RFC0793] to
   the server on the 995 port, or other, if explicitly mentioned.  As
   soon as successful connection is established, the TLS negotiation
   [RFC5246] SHALL be preformed.  RFC nnnn [I-D.melnikov-email-tls-
   certs] describes the procedure which MUST be followed by the clients
   to verify the server's certificate.  Upon successful negotiation all
   data SHALL be sent under TLS layer, as defined in Section 2.2. 
   Unsuccessful TLS negotiation SHALL lead to termination of TCP
   connection.

   As soon as successful TLS layer connection is established, the server
   sends the greeting line, as defined by RFC 1939.  Both the server and
   the client MUST enter AUTHORIZATION state then.

   Next, the client should authorize itself to the server.  If there is
   a bilateral convention between the parties regarding authorization
   using X.509 certificate, the client SHOULD first try to authorize
   itself using SASL EXTERNAL mechanism, which is defined in Appendix A
   of RFC 4422 [RFC4422].  For this purpose, the AUTH command [RFC5034]
   SHALL be used.  (Correspondingly, those servers and clients which
   support authentication using X.509 certificates MUST support the SASL
   EXTERNAL mechanism.)  Servers that lack configuration to accept an

INTERNET DRAFT               POP3 over TLS               August 30, 2011


   X.509 client certificate for authentication purposes SHOULD NOT send
   a CertificateRequest handshake to the client during TLS negotiation. 

   However, if SASL EXTERNAL authentication fails, or there was no
   certificate exchange during TLS negotiation, the client MAY either
   close the connection or try a different authentication mechanism
   (e.g., USER and PASS commands). 

   After the client has received the +OK response to the authentication
   command, both the client and server MUST enter TRANSACTION state, per
   RFC 1939.

   SSL 2.0 MUST NOT be used for POP3S; see RFC 6176 [RFC6176] for
   details.

2.2. Data Exchange

   All the data (explicitly, POP3 commands and responses), upon
   successful TLS negotiation, SHALL be sent as TLS "application data".

2.3. Connection Closure

   TLS provides the possibility for secure connection closure. 
   Therefore, upon POP3S transaction closure, the client SHALL initiate
   the exchange of TLS close alerts, which should happen before TCP
   connection termination.  When the server receives the TLS close
   alert, it may be sure that no other data will be sent in this
   connection.  The POP3 client MAY, after sending TLS close alert,
   terminate its part of connection without waiting for a response from
   the server.

2.4. Default Port

   POP3S uses the default port 995.  Section 4 updates the IANA
   registration for this port. 

2.5. Disadvantages of POP3S

   Section 7 of RFC 2595 [RFC2595] expresses concerns about use of a
   separate port for POP3S.  The concern about port usage does not apply
   as port 995 was previously registered.  RFC 6186 mitigates the other
   concerns.  The usefulness of POP3S outweighs these flaws so the
   statement in section 7 of RFC 2595 discouraging use of POP3S is
   rescinded.

3. Security Considerations

   POP3S uses TLS [RFC5246] to provide protection from eavesdropping and

   tampering with POP3 protocol content.  The security considerations of
   TLS [RFC5246] and those related to server identity verification
   [RFC6125][I-D.melnikov-email-tls-certs] apply. 

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to update the registration of the TCP well-known port
   995 using the following template (see RFC 6335 [RFC6335]):

     Service Name: pop3s

     Transport Protocol: TCP
