			This specification defines a new SDP Grouping Framework extension, "BUNDLE", 
			that can be used with the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer 
			mechanism to negotiate the usage of bundled media, which refers to the usage 
			of a single 5-tuple for media associated with multiple SDP media descriptions 
			("m=" lines).
		</t>

<middle>
    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
		<t>
			In the IETF RTCWEB WG, a need to use a single 5-tuple for sending and receiving media 
			associated with multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" lines) has been identified. This 
			would e.g. allow the usage of a single set of Interactive Connectivity Establishment 
			(ICE) <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5245"/> candidates for multiple 
			media descriptions. Normally different media types (audio, video etc) will be described 
			using different media descriptions.			
		</t>		
		<t>
			This specification defines a new SDP Grouping Framework <xref format="default" pageno="false" 
			target="RFC5888"/> extension, "BUNDLE", that can be used with the Session Description 
			Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer mechanism <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/> 
			to negotiate the usage of bundled media, which refers to the usage of a single 5-tuple for 
			media associated with multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" lines).
		</t>
		<t>
			The SDP Offerer and SDP Answerer <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/> use
			the "BUNDLE" grouping extension to indicate which media is associated with a single 5-tuple. For
			each media, the associated "m=" line is associated with a "BUNDLE" group.
		</t>
		<t>
			For each "BUNDLE" group, the SDP Offerer and SDP Answerer use an identical port number value
			in each "m=" line associated with the "BUNDLE" group. However, until it is known that the
			SDP Answerer supports the "BUNDLE" grouping extension, when the SDP Offerer generates an
			SDP Offer, a different port number value is inserted for each "m=" line associated with the 
			"BUNDLE" group. The port number value associated with the first "m=" line associated with
			the "BUNDLE" group represents the port value number offered to be used in the single 5-tuple.
		</t>		
		<t>
			NOTE: As defined in RFC 4566 <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC4566"/>, the 
			semantics of multiple "m=" lines using the same port number value are undefined, and 
			there is no grouping defined by such means. Instead, an explicit grouping mechanism needs 
			to be used to express the intended semantics. This specification provides such extension.
		</t>
		<t>
			SDP Offers and SDP Answer can contain multiple "BUNDLE" groups. For each "BUNDLE" group, 
			a different port number value MUST be used.
		</t>
		<t>
			When media is transported using the Real-Time Protocol (RTP) <xref format="default" 
			pageno="false" target="RFC3550"/>, the default assumption of the mechanism is that all 
			media associated with a "BUNDLE" group will form a single RTP Session <xref format="default" 
			pageno="false" target="RFC3550"/>. However, future specifications can extend the mechanism, 
			in order to negotiate RTP Session multiplexing, i.e. "BUNDLE" groups where media associated 
			with a group form multiple RTP Sessions.
		</t>
		<t>
			The mechanism is backward compatible. Endpoints that do not support the "BUNDLE" grouping
			extension are expected to generate SDP Offers and SDP Answers without inserting a "BUNDLE" 
			group, and to insert different port number values in each "m=" line, in the SDP Offers and
			SDP Answers, as defined in RFC 4566 and RFC 3264.

	<section title="SDP Grouping Framework BUNDLE Extension Semantics" toc="default">
		<t>
			This section defines a new SDP Grouping Framework extension, "BUNDLE".
		</t>
		<t>
			The "BUNDLE" extension can be indicated using an SDP session-level 'group'
			attribute. Each SDP media description ("m=" line) that is grouped together, 
			using an SDP media-level 'mid' attribute, is part of a specific "BUNDLE" 
			group.
		</t>
    </section>
	
    <section title="SDP Offer/Answer Procedures" toc="default">
		<section anchor="sec-oa-gen" title="General" toc="default">
			<t>
				When an endpoint generates an SDP Offer or SDP Answer, which contains a "BUNDLE" 
				group, it MUST insert an SDP session-level 'group' attribute, with a "BUNDLE" value, 
				and assign SDP media-level 'mid' attribute values for each "m=" line associated the 
				"BUNDLE" group.
			</t>
			<t>
				Until it is known whether the SDP Answerer supports the "BUNDLE" grouping extension, 
				the SDP Offerer MUST, for each "m=" line associated with a "BUNDLE" group:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>1. Insert different port number values.</t>
					<t>2. Insert identical connection data ("c=" line) value.</t>
					<t>3. Insert different SDP 'rtcp' attribute value, when used.</t>
					<t>4. Insert different ICE candidate values, when used.</t>
					<t>5. Insert an SDP 'rtpc-mux' attribute.</t>
					<t>6. Insert identical DTLS-SRTP fingerprint attribute, when used</t>
					<t>7. Insert different SDES crypto attribute, when used</t>
				</list>				
			</t>		
			<t>				
				Once it is known that both endpoints support the "BUNDLE" grouping extension, 
				the SDP Offerer and SDP Answerer MUST, for each "m=" line associated with 
				a "BUNDLE" group:				
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>1. Insert identical port number values.</t>
					<t>2. Insert identical connection data ("c=" line) value.</t>
					<t>3. Insert identical SDP 'rtcp' attribute value, when used.</t>
					<t>4. Insert identical ICE candidate values, when used.</t>
					<t>5. Insert an SDP 'rtpc-mux' attribute.</t>
					<t>6. Insert identical DTLS-SRTP fingerprint attribute, when used</t>
					<t>7. Insert different SDES crypto attribute, when used</t>
				</list>				
			</t>	
			<t>
				Once both endpoints have indicated support of the "BUNDLE" grouping extension, 
				they can start using the single port for the media associated with each "m=" line 
				in the "BUNDLE group".			
			</t>
			<t>
				OPEN ISSUE #1: If the SDP Answerer supports "BUNDLE", do we mandate that 
				"m=" lines must be grouped in the same way in the SDP Answer as they 
				are grouped in the SDP Offer?			
			</t>
		</section>
			
		<section title="SDP Offerer Procedures" toc="default">			
			<t>
				When the SDP Offerer generates an SDP Offer that contains a "BUNDLE" group, the SDP 
				Offer MUST be generated according to the procedures in <xref format="default" 
				pageno="false" target="sec-oa-gen"/>.
			</t>
			<t>
				If the associated SDP Answer contains a "BUNDLE" group, and the SDP Offer contained
				different port number values in each "m=" line associated with the "BUNDLE" group, 
				the SDP Offerer MUST generate a new SDP Offer, and insert an identical port number 
				value for each "m=" line associated with the "BUNDLE" group. Unless ICE is used, the 
				SDP Offerer MUST generate the new SDP Offer immediately when it has received the SDP
				Answer indicating that the SDP Answerer supports the "BUNDLE" grouping extension. If
				ICE is used, the SDP Offer can wait until the SDP Offer indicating that ICE is
				finished is sent, as defined in RFC 5245.
			</t>	
			<t>
				NOTE: The reason for sending the new SDP Offer, which includes an identical port number
				value in each "m=" line associated with the "BUNDLE" group, is to ensure that
				intermediary entities that look at SDP information e.g. for different type of policing
				functions, have the correct information regarding which ports will be used for media.
			</t>
			<t>
				If the SDP Offer contains different port number values for each "m=" lines associated
				with the "BUNDLE" group, and if the associated SDP Answer does not contain a 
				"BUNDLE" group, the SDP Offerer MUST use the different port number values that were 
				included in the SDP Offer.
			</t>
			<t>
				Once it is known that both the SDP Offerer and SDP Answerer support the "BUNDLE" 
				grouping extension, in each subsequent SDP Offer towards the SDP Answerer, the SDP Offer
				MUST insert an identical port number value in each "m=" line associated with the "BUNDLE" 
				group.
			</t>
			<t>
				NOTE: If needed, the SDP Offerer is allowed to change the port number value in an 
				subsequent SDP Offer, but it still inserts the same identical port number value in 
				each "m=" line associated with the "BUNDLE" group.
			</t>
			<t>
				When generating an SDP Offer, if the SDP Offerer wants to disable media associated with an
				"m=" line in a "BUNDLE" group, it will insert a zero port number value in the disabled "m=" 
				line, as defined in RFC 3264. However, if the "m=" lines associated with the "BUNDLE" group 
				contain different port number values (i.e. the SDP Offer is generated until it is known 
				whether the SDP Answerer supports the "BUNDLE" grouping extension) the SDP Offerer MUST NOT set 
				the port number value of the first "m=" line associated with the "BUNDLE" group to zero.
			</t>
			<t>
				The SDP Offerer MUST NOT insert an identical port number value in multiple "m=" lines, unless
				the "m=" lines are associated with a "BUNDLE" group.
			</t>
			<t>
				OPEN ISSUE #2: If the session has been established without BUNDLE, do we allow BUNDLE to be 
				enabled later during the session?
			</t>
			<t>
				OPEN ISSUE #3: If the session has been established with BUNDLE, do we allow BUNDLE to be disabled
				later during the session, meaning that different port number values will be used for media
				associated with each "m=" line?
			</t>

		<section title="SDP Answerer Procedures" toc="default">
			<t>
				When an SDP Answerer receives an SDP Offer which contains a "BUNDLE" group, and the SDP Answerer 
				accepts the offered "BUNDLE" group, the SDP Answerer MUST generate an SDP Answer according to 
				the procedures in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="sec-oa-gen"/>.
			</t>
			<t>
				When generating the SDP Answer, if the SDP Answerer wants to reject media associated with an
				"m=" line in the "BUNDLE" group, it will insert a zero port number value in the disabled "m=" 
				line, as defined in RFC 3264.
			</t>
			<t>
				The SDP Answerer MUST NOT insert a "BUNDLE" group in an SDP Answer, unless the associated SDP Offer
				contains a "BUNDLE" group.
			</t>
			<t>
				The SDP Answerer MUST NOT insert an identical port number value in multiple "m=" lines, unless
				the "m=" lines are associated with a "BUNDLE" group.
			</t>
			<t>
				Until the SDP Answerer receives the new SDP Offer, which contains an identical port number value
				for each "m=" line associated with a "BUNDLE" group, it MUST use the port, and related information
				(ICE candidates, SDES keys etc) associated with the first "m=" line in the "BUNDLE" group.

			<t>
				When entities negotiate the usage of bundled media, the default assumption 
				is that all media associated with the bundled media will form a single RTP 
				session.
			</t>
			<t>
				The usage of multiple RTP Sessions within a "BUNDLE" group is outside the scope
				of this specification. Other specification needs to extend the mechanism in
				order to allow negotiation of such bundle groups.
			</t>
			<t>
				It is possible to use multiple "BUNDLE" groups, in case the RTP media within
				each group will be part of different RTP Sessions.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Single RTP Session" toc="default">
			<t>
				When a single RTP Session is used, media associated with all "m=" lines part 
				of a bundle group share a single SSRC <xref format="default" pageno="false" 
				target="RFC3550"/> numbering space.
			</t>			
			<t>
				In addition, the following rules and restrictions apply for a single RTP
				Session:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>- The dynamic payload type values used in the "m=" lines MUST NOT overlap.</t>
					<t>- The "proto" value in each "m=" line MUST be identical (e.g. RTP/AVPF).</t>
					<t>- A given SSRC SHOULD NOT transmit RTP packets using payload types that 
					originates from different "m=" lines.</t>
				</list>				
			</t>		
			<t>
				NOTE: The last bullet above is to avoid sending multiple media types from the same SSRC. 
				If transmission of multiple media types are done with time overlap RTP and RTCP fails 
				to function. Even if done in proper sequence this causes RTP Timestamp rate switching 
				issues [ref to draft-ietf-avtext-multiple-clock-rates].

			<t> 
				One of the main issues regarding the "BUNDLE" grouping extensions has been whether,
				in SDP Offers and SDP Answers, the same port number value should be inserted in "m=" 
				lines associated with a "BUNDLE" group, as the purpose of the extension is to negotiate
				the usage of a single 5-tuple for media associated with the "m=" lines. Issues
				with both approaches, discussed in the Appendix have been raised. The outcome was
				to specify a mechanism which uses SDP Offers with both different and identical
				port number values.
			</t>
			<t> 
				Below are the primary issues that have been considered when defining the "BUNDLE"
				grouping extension:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>1) Interoperability with existing UAs.</t>
					<t>2) Interoperability with intermediary B2BUA- and proxy entities.</t>
					<t>3) Time to gather, and the number of, ICE candidates.</t>
					<t>4) Different error scenarios, and when they occur.</t>
					<t>5) SDP Offer/Answer impacts, including usage of port number value zero.</t>

				RFC 4961 specifies a way of doing symmetric RTP but that is an a later
				invention to RTP and Bob can not assume that Alice supports RFC 4961. This
				means that Alice may be sending RTP from a different port than 10000 or
				10002 - some implementation simply send the RTP from an ephemeral
				port. When Bob's endpoint receives an RTP packet, the only way that Bob
				know if it should be passed to the video or audio codec is by looking at
				the port it was received on. This lead some SDP implementations to use the
				fact that each "m=" line had a different port number to use that port
				number as an index to find the correct m line in the SDP. As a result, some
				implementations that do support symmetric RTP and ICE still use a SDP data
				structure where SDP with "m=" lines with the same port such as:

		<section  title="Usage of port number value zero" toc="default">
			<t>
				In an SDP Offer or SDP Answer, the media associated with an "m=" line can be 
				disabled/rejected by setting the port number value to zero. This is different 
				from e.g. using the SDP direction attributes, where RTCP traffic will 
				continue even if the SDP "inactive" attribute is indicated for the 
				associated "m=" line.
			</t>
			<t>
				If each "m=" line associated with a "BUNDLE" group would contain different
				port number values, and one of those port would be used for the 5-tuple,
				problems would occur if an endpoint wants to disable/reject the "m=" line
				associated with that port, by setting the port number value to zero. After that,
				no "m=" line would contain the port number value which is used for the 5-tuple.				
				In addition, it is unclear what would happen to the ICE candidates associated 
				with the "m=" line, as they are also used for the 5-tuple.

			It would be looking for RTCP on port 49172 but would not see any

			<section  title="Traffic Policing" toc="default">
				<t> 
					Sometimes intermediaries do not act as B2BUA, in the sense that
					they don't modify SDP bodies, nor do they terminate SIP dialogs.
					Still, however, they may use SDP information (e.g. IP address and 
					port) in order to control traffic gating functions, and to set
					traffic policing rules. There might be rules which will trigger
					a session to be terminated in case media is not sent or received
					on the ports retrieved from the SDP. This typically occurs once the
					session is already established and ongoing.

			<section  title="Bandwidth Allocation" toc="default">
				<t> 
					Sometimes intermediaries do not act as B2BUA, in the sense that
					they don't modify SDP bodies, nor do they terminate SIP dialogs.
					Still, however, they may use SDP information (e.g. codecs and 
					media types) in order to control bandwidth allocation functions. 
					The bandwidth allocation is done per "m=" line, which means that
					it might not be enough if media associated with all "m=" lines
					try to use that bandwidth. That may either simply lead to bad
					user experience, or to termination of the call.

		<section  title="Candidate Gathering" toc="default">
			<t> 
				When using ICE, an candidate needs to be gathered for each port. This
				takes approximately 20 ms extra for each extra "m=" line due to the NAT
				pacing requirements. All of this gather can be overlapped with other
				things while the page is loading to minimize the impact. If the client
				only wants to generate TURN or STUN ICE candidates for one of the "m="
				lines and then use trickle ICE [TODO REF] to get the non host ICE
				candidates for the rest of the "m=" lines, it MAY do that and will not
				need any additional gathering time.
			</t>
			<t> 
				Some people have suggested a TURN extension to get a bunch of TURN
				allocation at once. This would only provide a single STUN result so in
				cases where the other end did not support BUNDLE, may cause more use of
				the TURN server but would be quick in the cases where both sides
				supported BUNDLE and would fall back to a successful call in the other
				cases.
