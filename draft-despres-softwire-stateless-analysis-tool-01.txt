   Feature Analysis Tool for stateless IPv4/IPv6 (MAP-T, MAP-E, 4rd)
           draft-despres-softwire-stateless-analysis-tool-01

Abstract

   This document proposes a discussion tool for the Softwire meeting at
   IETF 83 in Paris.

   Significant differentiating features between the MAP approach
   (proposed standards MAP-T and MAP-E) and the unified approach
   (proposed standard 4rd) are presented in tabular format.

   Its purpose is to facilitate decision making, and is therefore
   temporary.

Internet-Draft           Stateless Analysis Tool              March 2012


1.  Introduction

   Stateless solutions that are proposed for residual IPv4 service
   across IPv6-only networks will be discussed at IETF 83 in Paris,
   March 25-30, 2012.  This document proposes a tool to facilitate
   common understanding during these discussions, and thus facilitate
   decision making on what to standardize and why.

   It contains tables in which, for each of the major proposed
   specifications, MAP-T, MAP-E and 4rd, the most significant
   differentiating features are listed:

   o  Table 1 for features that depend on whether IPv4 packets are twice
      translated (MAP-T), tunneled with packet encapsulation (MAP-E), or
      tunneled with IPv4/IPv6 header mapping (4rd).

   o  Table 2 for features that depend on formats of IPv6 addresses that
      are derived from IPv4 addresses or, if addresses are shared, from
      addresses plus ports.

   o  Table 3 for features that depend on how port-sets of shared IPv4
      addresses are derived from Port-set Identifiers (PSIDs);

   o  Table 4 for miscellaneous features.

   Tables are based on available drafts whose references are listed in
   Section 3.  If needed to take care any valid points made on the
   mailing list between now and March 23, an update will be possible at
   the beginning of the Paris meeting.

   NOTE: There has been discussions concerning a feature of MAP-T
   whereby IPv4 applications of MAP-T CEs can communicate with IPv6-only
   hosts having IPv4 translatable addresses.  This feature hasn't been
   included as differentiating because BIH of [RFC6535] already exists,
   and can be used in MAP-E and 4rd CE nodes to get the same result.  It
   is however understood that this issue may need further clarification.
