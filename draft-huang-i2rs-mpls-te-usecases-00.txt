Abstract

   An MPLS Traffic Engineering(TE) network is typically configured and
   results of its operation are analyzed by Command Line Interface
   (CLI), SNMP or NETCONF.  These interactions to control MPLS TE and
   diagnose its operation encompass: MPLS TE configuration, MPLS TE
   protection, traffic switching-over, monitoring of MPLS TE and fault
   detection.

   Interface to the Routing System's (I2RS) Programmatic interfaces, as
   defined in [I-D.ward-i2rs-framework], provides an alternate way to
   control the configuration and diagnose the operation of MPLS TE.
   I2RS may be used for the configuration, manipulation, polling or
   analyzing MPLS TE.  This document describes set of use cases for
   which I2RS can be used for MPLS TE.  It is intended to provide a base
   for the solution draft describing a set of interfaces to MPLS TE.

1.  Introduction

   Typically, an MPLS TE network configured and results of its operation
   are analyzed by CLI, SNMP or NETCONF.  These interactions to control
   MPLS TE and diagnose its operation encompass: MPLS TE configuration,
   MPLS TE protection, traffic switching-over, traffic detection and
   fault detection.

   The I2RS Framework document [I-D.ward-i2rs-framework] describes a
   mechanism to control network protocols like MPLS TE using a set of
   programmatic interfaces.  These programmatic interfaces allow one to

   control MPLS TE network by analyzing its operational state and TE LSP
   data, plus manipulating TE LSP's configuration to achieve various
   goals.  The I2RS is not intended to replace any existing
   configuration mechanisms, (i.e.: Command Line Interface or NETCONF).
   Instead, I2RS is intended to augment those existing mechanisms by
   defining a standardized set of programmatic interfaces to enable
   easier configuration, interrogation and analysis of MPLS TE network.

   This document describes set of use cases for which I2RS's
   programmatic interfaces can be used to control and analyze the
   operation of MPLS TE.  The use cases described in this document cover
   the following aspects of MPLS TE: MPLS TE configuration, MPLS TE
   protection, MPLS TE traffic switching-over, monitoring of MPLS TE and
   fault detection.  The goal is to inform the community's understanding
   of where the I2RS MPLS TE extensions fit within the overall I2RS
   architecture.  It is intended to provide a basis for the solutions
   draft describing the set of Interfaces to the MPLS TE.

   architecture.  It is intended to provide a basis for the solutions
   draft describing the set of Interfaces to the MPLS TE.

2.  MPLS TE Configuration

   There is two types of TE LSP: static CR-LSP and dynamic TE LSP
   created by protocol of RSVP-TE or CR-LDP.  Static CR-LSP is
   configured with forwarding items such as interface, label and
   bandwidth etc. node by node.  Dynamic TE LSP is configured with MPLS
   TE parameters which are used to calculate path and set up TE LSP by
   protocol.  Both configurations are complex

   Following will introduce how to improve configuration efficiency with
   I2RS and I2RS controller.

2.1.  Static CR-LSP Configuration

   Nodes and interfaces to be gone through should be prepared with label
   and bandwidth before a static CR-LSP configuration, and then static
   CR-LSP will be configured through some forms of CLI or NETCONF.
   Static CR-LSP is used in small, simple topology and less service for
   its complex configuration.

Internet-Draft    Use Cases for an Interface to MPLS TE     October 2013


   Network programming software may be put in I2RS controller, and the
   software may include a path calculation entity, a label management
   entity and a bandwidth management entity.  With I2RS, it will greatly
   improve static CR-LSP configuration efficiency.

   LSP forward downloading is processed node by node.  When ingress node
   finishes forward downloading, the other nodes' forward item may not
   be ready and traffic will be lost in this condition.

   With I2RS, I2RS controller my download the forwarding items from
   egress node to ingress node, and download the next node forwarding
   item after getting the forward downloading success event from the
   fore device.

2.2.  RSVP-TE LSP Configuration

   MPLS TE defines abundant constraints such as explicit path,
   bandwidth, affinity, SRLG, priority and hop limit etc.  Local path
   calculation entity would calculate an appropriate path according to
   the constraints.  It is known to all that the calculated results are
   closely related with the request order, different calculation order
   may have different results.  Concurrent calculation would get the
   optimized result and hold more services in TE network.

   With I2RS, I2RS central controller would trigger global concurrent
   re-optimization timely or manually to re-optimize MPLS TE network and
   send the constraints include the calculated path to devices to re-
   signal the TE LSPs with make-before-break method.

3.  MPLS TE Protection

   There are so many kinds of protection for MPLS TE, such as TE tunnel
   protection, TE LSP protection and TE FRR protection.  Further, each
   protection may have two methods: 1:1 and 1+1 protection.  FRR may
   have another two methods: link and node protection.  With I2RS, I2RS
   controller can define the protection mode according to the service
   requirement.

   In addition, typically when it is told that there is no enough
   resource for the backup LSP or TE tunnel, it is usually not true in
   the distributed network.  If existing LSP or TE tunnel could be
   adjusted to bypass some links or nodes, resource will be released to
   the backup LSP or TE tunnel.  With I2RS, I2RS central controller
   would trigger concurrent calculation by the failed path calculation
   for the backup LSP or TE tunnel events.  Then the updated path will
   be set to devices to re-signal the TE LSPs with make-before-break
   method.  MPLS TE network would be re-optimized to hold the backup LSP
   or TE tunnel.

   With I2RS, I2RS central controller would trigger concurrent
   calculation by the fail calculation for the backup LSP or TE tunnel
   events and send updated path to devices to re-signal the TE LSPs with
   make-before-break method.  MPLS TE network would be re-optimized to
   hold the backup LSP or TE tunnel.

4.  MPLS TE Traffic Switching-over

   This section describes set of use cases of MPLS TE traffic switching-
   over.  The use cases described in this section cover the following
   aspects: failure detection, network upgrading, overloading and
   switch-over on schedule.

4.1.  Failure Detection

   There are many failure detect technologies such as Ethernet OAM/BFD/
   OAM/RSVP Hello.  When a failure is detected, traffic will be switched
   over to the backup path.  Re-optimization of the TE tunnel may fail
   for insufficient resource.

   With I2RS, I2RS central controller would trigger global concurrent
   optimization for the fail event and send updated path to devices to
   re-signal the TE LSPs with make-before-break method.

4.2.  Network Upgrading

   When upgrading in a network are planned (e.g., for maintenance
   purposes), some graceful mechanisms can be used to gracefully shut
   down MPLS-TE / GMPLS-TE on such resource as a TE link, a component
   link within a bundled TE link, a label resource, or an entire TE
   node, to avoid traffic disruption.  Typically IGP or RSVP-TE protocol
   is extended to notify ingress node to bypass the shut down point.

   With I2RS, I2RS controller gets the upgrade event from operator, and
   calculate another path for the affected TE tunnels to deviate the
   traffic from the resource to be upgraded.  After finishing upgrade,
   I2RS controller would switch back the traffic or re-optimize all the
   TE tunnels.  This will simplify the process without protocol
   extension.

4.3.  Overloading

   When there is overloading in some nodes, such as CPU overloading,
   memory overloading, label overloading or LSP number overloading in
   some nodes, setup of new TE LSPs should be rejected at this
   condition.  However, existing TE LSPs may be affected and TE LSPs
   flapping would occur.

Internet-Draft    Use Cases for an Interface to MPLS TE     October 2013


   Typically, a threshold value is set to avoid overloading, setup of
   new TE LSPs should be rejected in advance to avoid affection of the
   existing TE LSPs.  Protocol like IGP or RSVP-TE would be extended to
   take some new error code to notify all other nodes or ingress node to
   bypass the overloading nodes.

   With I2RS, I2RS controller may monitor devices and find overloading
   occurrence and disappearance, and it will avoid to choose the
   overloading node in the following calculations without protocol
   extension.

5.  Monitoring of MPLS TE

5.1.  Performance Monitoring

   Typically, performance measurement such as traffic statistics is done
   in the ingress node of TE tunnel.  There are many application about
   traffic analysis, traffic dining, and traffic forecast etc.  The
   applications depend on the statistics information reported to a
   central controller.  With I2RS, I2RS controller provides a platform
   to implement these applications.

   In automatic bandwidth adjustment application, with I2RS, I2RS
   controller would monitor and analyze TE tunnel real traffic and
   calculate a new path with the new bandwidth for TE tunnel if it is
   needed, and send to devices to re-signal the TE tunnel with make-
   before-break method.

5.2.  Fault monitoring

   When node or link failure happens, traffic will be switched over to
   the backup path.  At the same time, the failure information will be
   reported and recorded.  Network operator will process network
   management and maintenance based on the failed information.

   With I2RS, the failed information may be reported to the I2RS central
   controller.

5.3.  LSP State Monitoring

   In global concurrent re-optimization process in section 2.2, an LSP
   update may depend on another LSP to release resource for it.  I2RS
   controller will notify devices to re-signal TE LSPs one by one if
   there is dependency.  I2RS controller should be aware of the TE LSPs'
   state.  With I2RS, I2RS controller would monitor the TE LSPs' state.

   This document makes no request of IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   The MPLS TE use cases described in this document assumes use of
   I2RS's programmatic interfaces described in the I2RS framework
   mentioned in [I-D.ward-i2rs-framework].  This document does not
   change the underlying security issues inherent in the existing [I-D
   .ward-i2rs-framework].
