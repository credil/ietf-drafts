Abstract

   To enhance the reliability, bridged network is normally multi-homed
   to an EVPN network, there are two categories of mechanisms to avoid
   the layer 2 traffic loop. The first category does not require the PEs
   participating in the control protocol of the bridged network, while
   the second category requires that. [EVPN] described one of the first
   category mechanisms called  designated forwarder (DF) election to
   achieve loop avoidance and vlan-based load balancing. This draft
   mainly focuses on the second category of mechanisms which can achieve
   intra-vlan MAC-based load balancing. MAC-based VLAN balancing is more
   applicable than DF election mechanism if all end stations in bridged
   network are on the same VLAN which can cause traffic congestion in DF
   link.

1. Introduction

   [EVPN] introduces a solution for multipoint L2VPN services. In EVPN
   networks, MAC learning between PEs is not via the data
   plane( different from what happens in traditional bridging network)
   but via the control plane using multi-protocol (MP) BGP.

   To enhance the reliability, the PE nodes need offer multi-homed
   connectivity to a CE or access Network, i.e, both multi-homed device
   (MHD) as well as multi-homed network (MHN) scenarios in [EVPN-REQ]
   should be covered by E-VPN solution. In MHN scenario, the multi-homed
   Ethernet network would typically run a resiliency mechanism such as
   Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol [802.1Q] or Ethernet Ring Protection
   Switching [G.8032]. For example, EVPN can be used for Data Center(DC)
   interconnection to provide LAN extension for each DC site and each
   site is an MSTP networks. Normally each site should be multi-homed to
   multiple EVPN PEs to ensure the reliability.

   As defined in [EVPN-REQ], the following solutions should be provided
   for MHN scenario:

   A solution MUST support multi-homed network connectivity with
   active/standby redundancy.

   A solution MUST also support multi-homed network with active/active
   VLAN-based load balancing (i.e. disjoint VLAN sets active on
   disparate PEs).

   A solution MAY support VLAN-based load balancing among PEs that are
   member of a redundancy group spanning multiple ASes.

   A solution MAY support multi-homed network with active/active MAC-
   based load balancing (i.e. different MAC addresses on a VLAN are
   reachable via different PEs).

   The former three requirements can be addressed through designated
   forwarder (DF) election mechanism as described in [EVPN], a brief
   review of DF election mechanism will be given in section 3.

   This draft will mainly focus on a new mechanism to achieve
   active/active MAC-based load balancing to fulfil the fourth
   requirement. The details of the solution will be illustrated in
   section 4. Protocol extensions of EVPN for this mechanism will be
   given in section 5.

                      Figure 1 DF election mechanism

   As described in [EVPN], designated forwarder(DF) mechanism is
   required for loop avoidance. Only one of the links between the
   switched bridged network and the PEs is active for a given Ethernet
   tag, as shown by Figure 1. This mechanism does not require the PEs to
   participate in the control protocol of the bridged network. Bridges
   in the local bridged network runs normal Multiple Spanning Tree
   Protocol [802.1Q] or Ethernet Ring Protection Switching [G.8032].

   Through this method VLAN-based load balancing among PEs can be
   achieved. All end systems of one VLAN can access the EVPN network
   through only one PE.

   In this case, the Ethernet A-D route per Ethernet segment MUST be
   advertised with the "Active-Standby" flag set to one. Only one PE is
   elected as DF for each EVI(E-VPN Instance). Only DF is responsible
   for sending multicast, broadcast and unknown unicast traffic, on a
   given Ethernet tag to the bridged network. In order to perform better
   traffic load-balancing within a given segment, multiple DFs per
   Ethernet segment can be elected and each PE is the DF for a disjoint
   set of EVIs. An EVI is an E-VPN routing and forwarding instance on a
   PE and consists of one or more broadcast domains which is identified
   by an Ethernet Tag which are assigned to the broadcast domains of a
   given E-VPN instance by the provider of that E-VPN. The information
   about an Ethernet Tag on a particular Ethernet segment is advertised
   using an "Ethernet Auto-Discovery route(Ethernet A-D route)". In the
   case of a multi-homed CE, this route MUST carry the "ESI Label
   Extended Community" to enable split horizon.  Also, the route can be
   used for Designated Forwarder (DF) election and MAY be used to
   optimize the withdrawal of MAC addresses upon failure.

   For fast convergence case, upon a failure in connectivity to the
   attached segment, the PE withdraws the corresponding Ethernet A-D
   route. This triggers all PEs that receive the withdrawal to update
   their next-hop adjacencies for all MAC addresses associated with the
   Ethernet segment in question. If there is any other PE  advertising
   an Ethernet A-D route for the same segment, the PE updates the next-
   hop adjacencies to point to this backup PE(s).

   With DF mechanism, native frames enter and leave bridged network via
   the same designated forwarder for a given VLAN. It may cause
   congestion or suboptimal routing. PE and bridges should be carefully
   configured so that end stations on a remnant bridged LAN are
   separated into different VLANs that have different designated
   forwarders to achieve better load balancing.

4. Active/Active MAC-based load balancing mechanism

   Active/Active MAC-based load balancing mechanism requires the PEs to
   participate in the control plane protocol of the bridged network.
   With this mechanism, loop avoidance and per-vlan MAC-based load
   balancing can be achieved. So it can achieve better load balancing
   than DF election, and is more applicable if all end stations in
   bridged network on the same VLAN may cause traffic congestion over
   the link to DF.

   The following two solutions can be used to achieve active/active MAC-
   based load balancing. One is emulated MSTP root bridge solution;
   another is bridge control plane protocol tunneling solution. We will

   PE1 and PE2 act as an emulated MSTP root bridge. PE1 & PE2 use the
   same bridge ID to emit spanning tree BPDUs as the highest priority
   root Bx. All bridges in bridged network see PE1 and PE2 as single
   tree root. Therefore B1-B2 and B2-B3 links are blocked for loop
   avoidance by the spanning tree protocol.

   When B1-B3 link fails, alternate port p2 on B3 will start to send TC
   BPDU and go to forwarding state. PE2 receives TC BPDU from B2
   sequentially. PE2 tunnel the TC BPDU to PE1. At the same time, PE2
   notifies remote PE3 to flush the MAC table through corresponding
   Ethernet A-D route.

   With this solution, PE1 and PE2 needs to tunnel TC BPDU to each other
   when topology change occurs in the local bridged network.

            Figure 3 PE1 and PE2 act as normal MSTP bridge nodes

   The solution described in the previous section is applicable for
   STP/MSTP domain. Now we are going to present another solution which
   can be used for both MSTP and G.8032 domain. The basic idea is to
   tunnel the control plane messages of local domain among the multi-
   homed PEs over EVPN network.

4.2.1. Scenario 1: Local bridged network is MSTP

   PE1 and PE2 act as normal MSTP bridge nodes. MSTP root bridge can be
   PE or any switch in the bridged network. BPDU message can be sent
   through tunnel over EVPN network between PE1 and PE2. The tunnel can
   be MPLS P2P LSP, MPLS P2MP LSP, or NVO3 tunnel, etc. PE1 and PE2
   regard the BPDU tunnel as normal physical link. To avoid BPDU tunnel
   blocked by MSTP, link cost of the tunnel should be set to 0 or
   minimum value in MSTP network. With such configuration, it is
   expected that the blocked port by MSTP protocol can never be the EVPN
   network facing port on PEs.

4.2.2. Scenario 2: Local bridged network is G.8032

   Similarly, PE1 and PE2 act as normal G.8032 ring nodes. They support
   standard FDB MAC learning, forwarding, flush behavior and port
   blocking/unblocking mechanisms. G.8032 message can be sent through
   tunnel over EVPN network between PE1 and PE2. ring protection
   link(RPL) owner node can be PE or any switch in bridged network. If
   PE is RPL owner node, RPL can only be configured on access link and
   can never be configured on the EVPN network facing port on PEs.

4.2.3. Fast convergence

   For fast convergence, when a PE notice a topology change event, it
   should flush local MAC entries and notify the remote PE of the same
   EVPN instance to withdraw the corresponding Ethernet A-D route. The
   remote PE that received the withdrawal simply invalidates the MAC
   entries for that segment.

5. EVPN protocol extension

   ESI Label Extended Community MUST be included in EVPN Ethernet A-D
   route. All-Active multi-homing or active-standby multi-homing mode is
   decided by the "Active-Standby" bit in the flags of the ESI Label
   Extended Community through DF mechanism.

   ESI Label Extended Community should be extended to support the
   mechanisms illustrated in this document. "M" bit is introduced to
   indicate multi-homing mode of MAC-based all active without DF
   Election. DF selection procedures should be skipped if "M" bit is set
   to be 1. When remote PE receives Ethernet A-D route withdraw message,
   it simply invalidates the MAC entries for the segment that
   corresponding to the Ethernet A-D route.

   DF: As defined in [EVPN]. It should be ignored if M bit is 1.

   R: The bit is already defined as the "Root-Leaf" in [EVPN].

   M: The bit is defined as "MAC-based all active without DF Election"
   and may be set to 1. The above "DF" bit is significant only when "M"
   bit is set to 0. A value of 1 for M bit means that multi-homed site
   uses MAC-based active-active access.
