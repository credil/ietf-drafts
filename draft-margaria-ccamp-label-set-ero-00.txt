Abstract

   The paths chosen by Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE)
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be constrained using the Explicit
   Route (ERO) object and related sub-objects.  Standard ERO sub-objects
   can specify the Autonomous System (AS), LSR Node Ids, Numbered or
   unnumbered TE links, downstream and upstream labels, and PCE path
   keys thus restricting which resources are to be used by a TE-LSP.

   The Explicit Label Control (ELC) in the explicit route object (ERO)
   allows both terminating an LSP on a particular outgoing port and
   label of an egress node, as well as restricting which label to use on
   any hop along the path determined by the route.  However, currently,
   its not allowed to specify more than 2 labels (downstream and
   upstream label), and it is not possible to specify, for a given
   section or segment of a TE-LSP path, a set of labels to restrict
   which label to be allocated from a Set of candidate labels.

   This memo provides extensions to the RSVP-TE and PCEP protocols to
   support Label Sets in the form of ERO sub-objects, being applicable
   to ERO and ERO-like (IRO, RRO, XRO) sub-objects, extending the ELC
   concept to a set of candidate labels.

1.  Introduction

   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) can be route-constrained by making use of the Explicit
   Route (ERO) object and related sub-objects as defined in [RFC3209],
   [RFC3473], [RFC3477], [RFC4873], [RFC4874], [RFC5520] and [RFC5553].
   In general, ERO sub-objects identify the resources to be used by a
   GMPLS, and can be used to restrict, exclude (IRO/XRO), define (ERO)
   or report (RRO) such resources.

   The Explicit Label Control (ELC) in the explicit route object (ERO)
   allows both terminating an LSP on a particular outgoing port and
   label of an egress node, as well as restricting which label to use on
   any hop along the path determined by the route.  However, currently,
   its not allowed to specify more than 2 labels (downstream and
   upstream label), and it is not possible to specify, for a given
   section or segment of a TE-LSP path, a set of labels to restrict
   which label to be allocated from a Set of candidate labels.

   On the other hand, [RFC3473] defines the RSVP-TE LABEL_SET object,
   which can be used in a Path Message to restrict the choice of the
   generalized label, allocated by the downstream node to a set of
   labels.

   Extending the semantics of the Explicit Label Control to a label set
   and restricting / limiting the choice of label within a given Label
   Set, while maintaining the applicability of ERO and ERO-like RSVP-TE
   and PCEP objects can be beneficial in the following cases:

   o  To constrain and restrict the choice of a Label at a given port
      (including egress port) to be selected from a set of labels but
      without strictly enforcing a single value (for example, when
      conveying a set of available labels due to hardware limitations
      such as tunable wavelengths).

   o  Due to known label switching constraint on some section of the TE-
      LSP path: explicitly specify the label constraint on a specific
      link by requesting a Label Set to limit the choice of the label.

   o  To constraint a distributed wavelength assignment (D-WA) for a TE-
      LSP DWDM transparent optical section

   o  To allow a PCE or any other centralized entity to indicate a set
      of labels to be used in signaling, not only in the initial Label
      set but in any hop along the path.

   o  To allow a Path Computation Client (PCC) to indicate, as an input
      constraint when requesting a combined R&WA computation to a PCE,

      which set of wavelengths are acceptable at a given TE link,
      transparent segment or end-to-end path, depending on the label
      (wavelength) continuity restrictions of the underlying data plane.

   o  To exclude (i.e., in a XRO object) a set of Labels from being
      considered in a label allocation, reusing the efficient encoding
      that has been proposed for Label sets and Label set ERO sub-
      objects.

   o  To control resource sharing for pre-planned protecting LSP, where
      one can indicate which labels should be shared in addition to the
      PPRO disjointness constraints.

2.  Solution overview

   In order to support specifying several labels as a potential set of
   labels to be used when allocating a label, several solutions are
   applicable and described in this document:

      Allowing several consecutive Label ERO subobjects in an ERO
      object.

      Defining a Label Set ERO subobject to be used in an ERO (and
      similar) object.

      Extending the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object with a new TLV targeting
      attributes at a given node.

   A short overview of each solution is provided in the next sections
   and an evaluation of each one on is provided afterwards.

3.  Multiple consecutive Label ERO subobjects

   This approach would require relaxing the rules that define how Label
   sub-objects are used within an ERO/XRO/RRO object, and notably in
   what concerns Explicit Label Control.  In particular, the procedure
   described in [RFC3473] section 5.1.1 is modified as follows:

   The following SHOULD NOT result in a "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object"
   errors:

      For there to be two label subobjects with the same U-bit values

   It is allowed to have several consecutive Label subobects with the
   same U-bit values, which become equally valid alternatives for the
   downstream label.

   To support the label subobject, a node must check to see if one or
   more sub-objects following its associated address/interface sub-
   objects are label subobjects.  If this is the case, the sub-objects
   are examined: a RSVP-TE LABEL_SET object (Type 36) is constructed
   with the values of the labels that have the U-bit cleared.  This
   LABEL_SET object MUST be included in the outgoing Path message and
   MAY be splitted into several LABEL_SET objects (LABEL_SET for the
   downstream direction).  Note that this LABEL_SET does not replace the
   existing LABEL_SET and MAY be merged with it.

   The new Label_Set objects included in the Path message do not replace
   existing Label_Set object.

   If the U-bit of the subobject being examined is set (1), then the set
   of value of the Label subobject with U bit set should be used to
   restrict the choice of the upstream label associated with the
   bidirectional LSP.  If this label is not acceptable, a "Bad
   EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" error SHOULD be generated.  If the label is
   acceptable, the assigned label is copied into a new Upstream_Label
   object.  This Upstream_Label object MUST be included on the
   corresponding outgoing Path message.

4.  Label Set ERO subobject

   In this solution a new Label Set subobject is defined.

   The Label Set ERO subobject is defined as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |L|    Type     |     Length    |U|   Reserved  |   C-Type(1)   |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                             Label  Set                        |
    |                              ...                              |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   See [RFC3471] for a description of L,U and Label Set parameters.

   Type  x Label Set

   Length  The Length contains the total length of the subobject in
      bytes, including the Type and Length fields.  The Length is always
      divisible by 4.

   C-Type  The C-Type of the included Label Object.  Copied from the
      Label Object.

4.1.  Procedures

   The Label Set subobject follows a similar procedure to the
   aforementioned one that is used when several Label sub-objects are
   allowed.  The Label Set subobject must follow a subobject identifying
   the link where the Label Set is applicable (a subobject containing a
   IP address or an interface identifier) or a previous Label Set
   subobject.  Several Label Set subobject may be present.  The
   following SHOULD result in "bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" errors:

      If the first Label Set subobject is not preceded by a subobject
      containing an IP address or an interface identifier associated
      with an output link

      On unidirectional LSP setup, for there to be a label set subobject
      with the U-bit set

   It is not allowed to mix Label Set and Label subobject.

   The following text is adapted from the Label subobject procedure
   described in [RFC3473]



Margaria, et al.        Expires September 4, 2012               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         Expressing Label Set in ERO            March 2012


   To support the label set subobject, a node must check to see if the
   subobject following its associate address/interface is a label set
   subobject.  If it is, the following subobjects are examined.  If the
   U-bit of the subobject being examined is clear (0), then value of the
   label set is copied into a a RSVP-TE LABEL_SET object (Type 36).  One
   LABEL_SET object MUST be included in the outgoing Path message.  The
   LABEL-SET object MAY be splitted into several LABEL_SET objects or
   MAY be merged with the existing LABEL-SET objects of this LSP.

   If the U-bit of the subobject being examined is set (1), then value
   of the label set is used to choose the label to be used for upstream
   traffic associated with the bidirectional LSP.  If this label is not
   acceptable, a "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" error SHOULD be generated.
   If the label set is acceptable and a label assigned, the label is
   copied into a new Upstream_Label object.  This Upstream_Label object
   MUST be included on the corresponding outgoing Path message.

   After processing, the label set subobjects are removed from the ERO.

   Note an implication of the above procedures is that the label set
   subobject should never be the first subobject in a newly received
   message.  If the label subobject is the the first subobject an a
   received ERO, then it SHOULD be treated as a "Bad strict node" error.

   Procedures by which an LSR at the head-end of an LSP obtains the
   information needed to construct the Label Set subobject are outside
   the scope of this document.

5.  LSP_ATTRIBUTE extensions

   In order to indicate, at a given hop or interface within the ERO, a
   set of candidate labels to be used when selecting the generalized
   label, it is also possible to use LSP_ATTRIBUTE extensions [RFC5240]
   .  To this end, the procedure to generate the outgoing RSVP-TE Path
   message LABEL_SET object from the information contained in the
   LSP_ATTRIBUTE is similar conceptually to the previous ones.  The
   following new TLVs are required for this solution :

   o  a TLV indicating attributes for a node/interface (one per node/
      interface)

   o  This TLV will contain sub-TLV, here:

      *  Attribute Flag TLV

      *  A Label Set TLV

      *  Any Attribute TLV which are applicable to a specific Node/
         interface

   A new flag should be defined for the Targeted LSP attribute,
   requiring this will then depend in which object this is added.  The
   Label Set TLV also required a new flag, but it SHOULD NOT appear
   directly in the LSP_ATTRIBUTE, this solution add TLVs that can be
   scoped only to specific interface or node.  The RRO subobject
   attribute processing is not modified, a Node MAY report all the bits
   from the Attribute flag TLV in LSP_ATTRIBUTES or/and
   LSP_REQUIERED_ATTRIBUTES or/and the Attribute flag TLV in the
   TARGETED_LSP_ATTRIBUTE TLV.

5.1.  TARGETED_LSP_ATTRIBUTE TLV

   A new TLV is introduced, the TARGETED_LSP_ATTRIBUTE TLV, which is
   valid on Path message only in LSP_ATTRIBUTE and
   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object.

5.2.  PCEP Extensions

   This solution does not fit to existing PCEP object, One possible
   solution would be to map the RSVP LSP_ATTRIBUTE logic to PCEP LSPA
   object and define a set of LSPA TLVs carrying relevant LSP_ATTRIBUTE
   TLVs.  This is for further study.

6.  Evaluation of proposed solution alternatives

   The First two solutions would easily allow a centralized entity such
   as a PCE or a NMS to add this per-hop constraints information but
   would imply a greater impact to existing deployments.  Let us note
   that, in general, a PCE currently uses the existing ERO sub-objects
   (with different semantics) in the following PCEP sub-objects.

   o  ERO - to indicate the result of a Path Computation given one or
      more requests.

   o  IRO - to specify which elements, resources, etc. must be used in a
      path computation.

   o  XRO - to specify which elements, resources, etc. must be excluded
      in a path computation.

   o  RRO - to report of existing Paths

   Making use of the LSP_ATTRIBUTES would reduce the impact on existing
   deployment yet allow to mandate the support of the attribute if
   desired, but will introduce several source for Label information.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Label Set ERO subobject

   IANA is requested to make the following subobject allocations from
   the "EXPLICIT_ROUTE Subobject Type" registry.


                       Sub-object type TBA

                       Name            Label Set

                       Reference       This document

7.2.  LSP_ATTRIBUTE

   IANA is request to add the following information for each TLV in the
   RSVP TLV type identifier registry.

   o  Whether allowed on TARGETED_LSP_ATTRIBUTE TLV

   The existing registry is modified for existing TLVs.

7.2.1.  Attribute Flags

   The new TLV type definition is as follow

   o  TLV Type = 1

   o  TLV Name = Attribute Flags TLV

   o  Allowed on LSP_ATTRIBUTES object

   o  Allowed on LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object

   o  Allowed on TARGETED_LSP_ATTRIBUTE TLV

7.2.2.  Service ID TLV

   The new TLV type definition is as follow

   o  TLV Type = 1

   o  TLV Name = Attribute Flags TLV

   o  Allowed on LSP_ATTRIBUTES object

   o  Not allowed on LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object

   o  Not allowed on TARGETED_LSP_ATTRIBUTE TLV

7.2.3.  Targeted LSP attribute TLV

   IANA is requested to make the following allocations from the RSVP
   Attribute TLV Space registry.

   o  TLV Type = n

   o  TLV Name = Targeted LSP attribute TLV

   o  Allowed on LSP_ATTRIBUTES object

   o  Allowed on LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object

   o  Not allowed on TARGETED_LSP_ATTRIBUTE TLV

   IANA is request to make the following allocation from the RSVP
   Attribute Flags registry

   Bit   Name            Attribute Flags Attribute Flags  RRO Reference
   No                    Path            Resv
