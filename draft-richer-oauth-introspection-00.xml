    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>In OAuth, the contents of tokens are opaque to clients. This means
      that the client does not need to know anything about the content or
      structure of the token itself, if there is any. However, there is still
      a large amount of metadata that may be attached to a token, such as its
      current validity, approved scopes, and extra information about the
      authentication context in which the token was issued.</t>

      <t>This specification defines an Introspection Endpoint that allows the
      holder of a token to query the Authorization Server to discover the set
      of meta-information for a token.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Introspection Endpoint">
      <t hangText="instance_name">The Introspection Endpoint is an OAuth 2
      Endpoint that responds to HTTP GET and HTTP POST requests from token
      holders. The endpoint takes a single parameter representing the token
      (and optionally further authentication) and returns a JSON document
      representing the meta information surrounding the token.</t>

      <section title="Introspection Request">
        <t hangText="instance_name"><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="token">the string value of the token.</t>
          </list>The endpoint SHOULD also require some form of authentication
        to access this endpoint, such as the Client Authentication as
        described in <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2 Core Specification</xref>
        or a separate OAuth2 Access Token. The methods of managing and
        validating these authentication credentials are out of scope of this
        specification. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Introspection Response">
        <t>The server responds with a JSON object in <spanx style="code">application/json</spanx>
        format with the following top-level members. Specific implementations
        MAY extend this structure with their own service-specific pieces of
        information.</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="valid">REQUIRED. Boolean indicator of whether or not
            the presented token is valid. </t>

            <t hangText="expires_at">OPTIONAL. Integer timestamp, measured in
            the number of seconds since January 1 1970 UTC, indicating when
            this token will expire.</t>

            <t hangText="issued_at">OPTIONAL. Integer timestamp, measured in
            the number of seconds since January 1 1970 UTC, indicating when
            this token was originally issued.</t>

            <t hangText="scope">OPTIONAL. Array of strings representing the
            scopes associated with this token.</t>

            <t hangText="user_id">OPTIONAL. Local identifier of the Resource
            Owner who authorized this token.</t>

            <t hangText="client_id">OPTIONAL. Client Identifier for the Client
            that requested this token.</t>

            <t hangText="audience">OPTIONAL. Service-specific string
            identifier of the intended audience for this token.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Non-normative Example">
        <t hangText="instance_name">For example, a Protected Resource accepts
        a request from a Client carrying an OAuth2 Bearer Token. In order to
        know how and whether to serve the request, the Protected Resource then
        makes the following request to the Introspection Endpoint of the
        Authorization Server.</t>

          <preamble>Following is a non-normative example request (with line

        </figure>

        <t>The Authorization Server validates the client credentials and looks
        up the information in the token. If the token is valid, it returns the
        following JSON document.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>If left unprotected and un-throttled, the Introspection Endpoint
      could present a means for an attacker to poll a series of possible token
      values, fishing for a valid token. Therefore, the Authorization Server
      SHOULD issue special client credentials to any protected resources or
      clients that need to access the introspection endpoint. These
      credentials may be used directly at the endpoint, or they may be
      exchanged for an OAuth2 Access token scoped specifically for the
      Introspection Endpoint.</t>
