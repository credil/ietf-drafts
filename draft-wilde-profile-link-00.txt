                    The 'profile' Link Relation Type
                      draft-wilde-profile-link-00

Abstract

   This specification defines the 'profile' link relation type that
   allows resource representations to indicate that they are following
   one or more profiles.  A profile is defined to not alter the
   semantics of the resource representation itself, but to allow clients
   to learn about additional semantics that are associated with the
   resource in addition to those defined by the media type and possibly
   other mechanisms.

Internet-Draft             "profile" Link Type                March 2012


1.  Introduction

   One of the foundations of the Internet and Web Architecture is the
   fact that resource representations communicated through protocols
   such as SMTP or HTTP are labeled with a 'media type', which allows a
   client to understand at run time what 'type' of resource
   representation it is handling.  Sometimes, it would be useful for
   servers and clients to include additional information about the
   nature of the resource, so that a client understanding this
   additional information could react in a way specific to that
   specialization of the resource.  HTML 4 [3] has such a mechanism
   built into the language, which is the 'profile' attribute of the
   'head' element.  This mechanism, however, is specific to HTML alone,
   and it seems as if HTML 5 will drop support for this mechanism
   entirely.

   This specification registers a 'profile' link relation type according
   to the rules of RFC 5988 [1].  This link relation type is independent
   of the resource representation it is used in (but the representation
   must support types links for this mechanism to work) and independent
   of the target of the linked URI.  In fact, for the purpose of this
   specification, the URI does not necessarily have to link to a
   dereferencable resource, and clients can treat the occurrence of a
   specific URI in the same sense as a namespace URI and invoke specific
   behavior based on the assumption that a specific profile URI signals
   that a resource follows a specific profile.  Note that at the same
   time, it is possible for profile URIs to use referencable URIs and
   use a media type (which is outside the scope of this specification)
   which represents the information about the profile in a human- or
   machine-readable way.

   As one example, consider the case of podcasts, a specific kind of
   feed using additional fields for media-related metadata.  Using a
   'profile' link, it would be possible for a client to understand that
   a specific feed is supposed to be a podcast feed, and that it may
   contain entries using podcast-specific fields.  This may allow a
   client to behave differently when handling such a feed (such as
   rendering a UI), even when the current set of entries in the feed may
   not contain any podcast entries.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

3.  Resource Profiles

   The concept of a resource profile has no strict definition on the
   Internet or within the Web. For the purpose of this specification, a
   resource profile are additional semantics that can be used to process
   a resource.  These semantics SHOULD be independent of specific
   representations of both the resources using them, and a of a specific
   profile representation (if it exists), so that a profile URI can be
   reused across media types.  Furthermore, a profile MUST NOT change
   the semantics of the resource when processed without profile
   knowledge, so that clients both with and without knowledge of a
   profiled resource can safely use the same representation.

   Profiles can be combined, meaning that a single resource can conform
   to zero or any number of profiles.  Depending on the profile support
   of clients it is this possible that the same resource, when linked to
   a number of profiles, can be processed with very different sets of
   processing rules, based on the profile knowledge of the clients.

   Profiles are identified by URI, but as with for example XML namespace
   URIs, the URI in this case first and foremost serves as an
   identifier, meaning that the presence of a certain URI can be
   sufficient for a client to assert that a resource conforms to a
   profile.  However, in some settings it may be desirable to allow
   profiles to change at runtime, in which case it is necessary for
   clients to dereference links to profiles and interpret the profile
   representation they retrieve.  In such a scenario, a media type for
   profile representation is required, but both the scenario and the
   required media type are outside of the scope of this specification.


4.  IANA Considerations

   The link relation type below has been registered by IANA per Section
   6.2.1 of RFC 5988 [1]:

      Relation Name: profile

      Description: Identifying that a resource conforms to a certain
      profile, without affecting the non-profile semantics of the
      resource.

      Reference: RFC xxxx (this draft's eventual RFC number)

      Notes: Profile URIs are primarily intended to be used as
      identifiers, and thus clients SHOULD NOT indiscriminately access
      profile URIs.

5.  Security Considerations

   The 'profile' relation type is truly believed not to raise any new
   security issues which are not discussed in RFC 5988 [1] for generic
   use of Web linking mechanism.
