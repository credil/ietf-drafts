                 Transmission of IPv6 Extension Headers
                  draft-carpenter-6man-ext-transmit-00

Abstract

   Various IPv6 extension headers have been defined since the IPv6
   standard was first published.  This document updates RFC 2460 to
   describe how intermediate nodes should deal with such extension
   headers and with any that are defined in future.  It also specifies
   how extension headers should be registered by IANA, with a
   corresponding minor update to RFC 2780.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Extension Header Transmission        August 2012


1.  Introduction

   An initial set of IPv6 extension headers was defined by [RFC2460],
   which also described how they should be handled by intermediate
   nodes, with the exception of the hop-by-hop options header:

   "...extension headers are not examined or processed
   by any node along a packet's delivery path, until the packet reaches
   the node (or each of the set of nodes, in the case of multicast)
   identified in the Destination Address field of the IPv6 header."

   This provision allowed for the addition of new extension headers,
   since it means that forwarding nodes should be completely transparent
   to them.  Thus, new extension headers could be introduced
   progressively, used only by hosts that have been updated to create
   and interpret them.  Several such extension headers have been defined
   since RFC 2460.

   Unfortunately, experience has showed that the network is not
   transparent to these headers.  The main reason for this is that some
   firewalls attempt to inspect the transport payload.  This means that
   they traverse the chain of extension headers, if present, until they
   find the payload.  If they encounter an unknown extension header
   type, some of these firewalls treat the packet as suspect and drop
   it.  It is an established fact that several widely used firewalls do
   not recognise some or all of the extension headers defined since RFC
   2460.  It has also been observed that a few firewalls do not even
   recognise all the extension headers in RFC 2460, including the
   fragment header, causing fundamental problems of connectivity.

   Other types of middlebox, such as load balancers or packet
   classifiers, might also fail in the presence of extension headers
   that they do not recognise.

   A contributory factor to this problem is that, because extension
   headers are numbered out of the existing IP Protocol Number space,
   there is no collected list of them.  For this reason, it is hard for
   an implementor to quickly identify the full set of valid extension
   headers.  An implementor who consults only RFC 2460 will miss all
   extension headers defined subsequently.

   [RFC6564] improves the situation by defining a uniform format for any
   future extension headers, but this in itself is insufficient.  The
   present document clarifies that the above requirement from RFC 2460
   applies to all types of node that forward IPv6 packets and to all
   extension headers defined now and in the future.  It also requests
   IANA to create a subsidiary registry that clearly identifies valid
   extension header types, and updates RFC 2780 accordingly.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Extension Header Transmission        August 2012


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Requirement to Transmit Extension Headers

   [NOTE IN DRAFT: These requirements may look controversial compared to
   RFC 2460, and are presented for discussion in the WG.  In reality,
   hop-by-hop options are not handled by many high speed routers, or are
   processed only on a slow path.  Also, many firewalls inspect and
   filter extension headers.  The following text is intended to deal
   with those realities.]

   The IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options header SHOULD be processed by
   intermediate nodes as described in [RFC2460].  However, it is to be
   expected that some high performance routers will either ignore it, or
   assign packets containing it to a slow processing path.  Designers
   planning to use a Hop-by-Hop option should be aware of this likely
   behaviour.

   Apart from that, any node along an IPv6 packet's path, which forwards
   it for any reason, SHOULD do so regardless of any extension headers
   that are present, as described in RFC 2460.  Exceptionally, if this
   node is designed to examine extension headers for any reason, such as
   firewalling, it MUST recognise and deal appropriately with all valid
   IPv6 extension header types.  The list of currently valid extension
   header types is maintained by IANA (see Section 4).

   RFC 2460 requires destination hosts to discard packets containing
   unrecognised extension headers.  However, intermediate forwarding
   nodes MUST NOT do this by default, since that might cause them to
   inadvertently discard traffic using a recently defined extension
   header, not yet recognised by the intermediate node.

   As mentioned above, firewalls that violate RFC 2460 by discarding
   packets containing valid extension headers are known to cause
   connectivity failures.  Therefore, it is important that firewalls
   behave according to the above requirements.  If a firewall chooses to
   discard a packet containing a valid IPv6 extension header, it MUST be
   the result of an explicit firewall policy, and not just the result of
   a failure to recognise such a header.

   The IPv6 Routing Header Types 0 and 1 have been deprecated and SHOULD
   NOT be used.  However, as specified in [RFC5095], this does not mean
   that the IPv6 Routing Header can be unconditionally dropped by
   forwarding nodes.  Packets containing undeprecated Routing Headers
   MUST be forwarded by default.

3.  Security Considerations

   Firewall devices MUST conform to the requirements in the previous
   section.  In particular, packets containing specific extension
   headers are only to be discarded as a result of explicit policy, and
   never by default.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to replace the existing empty IPv6 Next Header
   Types registry by an IPv6 Extension Header Types registry, clearly
   marked as subsidiary to the existing Assigned Internet Protocol
   Numbers registry.  It will contain only those protocol numbers which
   are also IPv6 Extension Header types.  The initial list will be as
   follows:
   o  0, Hop-by-Hop Options, [RFC2460]
   o  43, Routing, [RFC2460], [RFC5095]
   o  44, Fragment, [RFC2460]
   o  50, Encapsulating Security Payload, [RFC4303]
   o  51, Authentication, [RFC4302]
   o  58, ICMPv6, [RFC2460]
   o  59, No Next Header, [RFC2460]
   o  60, Destination Options, [RFC2460]
   o  135, MIPv6, [RFC6275]
   o  139, HIP, [RFC5201]
   o  140, shim6, [RFC5533]

   Any future IPv6 Extension Header types will be added to this registry
   as well as to the Assigned Internet Protocol Numbers registry.

   The reference to the IPv6 Next Header field in [RFC2780] applies
   equally to the IPv6 Extension Header field.
