<t>
	PIM Group-to-RP mappings are distributed dynamically using protocols
   such as BSR or Auto-RP.  The BGP-MVPN specification provides for this
   information to be encapsulated in an I-PMSI or S-PMSI provider tunnel
   between the PEs in an MVPN environment.  Since this is control
   information, it is desirable to signal this information in BGP
   between PEs, similar to carrying other customer control state
   such as C-Multicast routes.  This document specifies the mechanisms and 
   procedures to carry bootstrap information via BGP to provide true control and data plane separation.

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
   In PIM-SM <xref target='RFC4601'/>, the Group-to-RP mapping information 
   is distributed dynamically through methods such as BSR <xref target='RFC5059'/>
   or Auto-RP. When multicast is deployed in an VPN environment, PEs in the provider space 
   need to carry this information transparently across its core so that CEs in all the sites 
   can access this RP information. MVPN specification <xref target='RFC6513'/> defined a mechanism in section 5.3.4 
   where the BSR messages can be transmitted in the provider space over PMSI tunnels.  
   However, carrying control messages like BSR in the data tunnels is not 
   always desirable. BGP encodings in BGP-MVPN specification <xref target='RFC6514'/> already define 
   mechanisms to carry C-Multicast route information in BGP. This document specifies 
   carrying BSR Group-to-RP mapping information through BGP. Auto-RP mechanism is out of scope for this specification.  
</t>
</section>
<section title="Terminology">
<t>
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target='RFC2119'/>.
</t>

<t>
   This document uses the following terms:
</t>

<t>
         "MVPN"
</t>

<t>
          "Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs" <xref target='RFC6513'/> includes two different methods, BGP and PIM, 
for exchanging customer's multicast control information. This document only deals with
BGP for exchanging the customer multicast control information. MVPN in the following sections refers to BGP-MVPN.

</t>


<t>
         "C-Multicast routes"
</t>

<t>
          MVPN customer's multicast routing information that is carried in BGP is referred in 
this document as C-Multicast routes. 

</t>


<t>
         "RP-Set"
</t>

<t>
          RP-Set is the Group-to-RP mapping information distributed by 
BSR. 
</t>
</section>
<section title="Motivation">
<section title="Unified BGP based control plane">
<t>
In BGP based MVPN, PE Auto Discovery and the exchange of PIM Join/Prune state,
are a part of the customer multicast control plane and are accomplished via advertisements
of BGP MVPN NLRI. BSR/Auto-RP protocols also carry a type of customer multicast control information. Carrying them
in BGP is not only logical but also gives a unified BGP based control plane to carry all the
Customer space control messages. 
</t>
</section>
<section title="Manageability at a common provider location">
<t>
A provider of MVPN services would be interested to know the customer's RP topology and the detailed
mappings. This information will be critical for operations to troubleshoot and/or manage customer's
multicast deployments. Like the C-Multicast routes, obtaining this information at a centralized location
like a BGP Route-Reflector is desired. In the current MVPN specifications, if a provider wants such information, 
it needs to be obtained from the customer VRFs on all PE's importing these customer VRF's. More so, obtaining 
this information on each PE through intervals is prone to information lost between intervals, especially with 
soft-state control protocols like PIM. Since the RP-Set information is not a control message passed through BGP,
obtaining this information is not possible through BGP Route Reflector. 

</t>
</section>
<section title="Avoiding unnecessary Provider Tunnels">
<t>
With the current specification, the RP-Set is carried via PMSI tunnels. There may be deployments
which uses only S-PMSI. Carrying BSR information through S-PMSI implies creating 
tunnels just to carry control information. Also, if the BSR is located at the receiver-only site, an S-PMSI tunnel
needs to be created with the PE at receiver site as root. This PE needs to create an S-PMSI tunnel
with bursty source just for distributing control message which was otherwise not required to be
setup as it is a receiver-only PE. 
</t>

</section>
</section>

<section title="MCAST-VPN-BSR NLRI">
<t>
This document defines a new NLRI called the MCAST-VPN-BSR NLRI. 
The format of the MCAST-VPN-BSR NLRI is identical to what is defined in BGP-MVPN <xref target='RFC6514'/>
</t>
<figure>
<artwork>
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   Route Type (1 octet)              |
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   Length (1 octet)                  |
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   Route Type specific (variable)    |
      +-------------------------------------+
	  
</artwork>
</figure>
<t>
The following 3 Route Types are defined for MCAST-VPN-BSR NLRI. 
</t>
<t>
<list>
<t>
1 - BSR Parameters
</t>
<t>
2 - BSM Group parameters
</t>
<t>
3 - BSM RP Parameters
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
The MCAST-VPN-BSR NLRI is carried in BGP <xref target='RFC4271'/> with an AFI of 1 or 2 and a SAFI of MCAST-VPN-BSR.
In order for two BGP speakers to exchange MCAST-VPN-BSR NLRIs, they must use a BGP Capabilities Advertisement to ensure 
that they both are capable of properly processing such an NLRI.  This is done as specified in [RFC4760], by using capability 
code 1 (multiprotocol BGP) with an AFI of 1 or 2 and a SAFI of MCAST-VPN-BSR.
</t>
<section title="BSR Parameters NLRI">
<t>
   A BSR Parameters Route Type specific MCAST-VPN-BSR NLRI consists of
   the following:
</t>
<figure>
<artwork>
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   RD   (8 octets)                   |
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   len of BSR Address (1 octet)      |
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   BSR Address (Variable length)     |
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   Hash Mask Length (1 octet)        |
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   BSR Priority (1 octet)            |
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   Originating PE's IP Address       |
      +-------------------------------------+

</artwork>
</figure>
 <t>
 The RD is encoded as described in <xref target='RFC4364'/>.
 </t>
<t>
BSR Address defines the Elected/Candidate BSRs IP address extracted from the Bootstrap message. The field "len of BSR Address" 
determines whether it is IPv4 or IPv6. If the value is 32, the corresponding IP address is an IPv4 address. If the value is 
128 it is an IPv6 address. 
</t>
<t>
BSR priority is a 1 octet value as defined in BSR specification <xref target='RFC5059'/>.
</t>
<t>
Hash Mask Length is a 1 octet value which is used for RP selection by the routers running BSR. This value
MUST be taken from the BSM and copied in to the BSR Parameters route by the originating router. 
</t>
<t>
Originating PE's IP Address field is set to the IP address that the PE places in the Global Administrator field of the 
VRF Route Import Extended Community of the VPN-IP routes advertised by the PE. For a given MVPN, a single such IP 
address MUST be used, and that same IP address MUST be used as the originating PE's IP address in all route types of the 
MCAST-VPN-BSR NLRI that the PE transmits.
</t>
<t>
The usage and details of this NLRI is discussed in "Protocol Details" section.
</t>
</section>
<section title="BSM Group Parameters NLRI">
<t>
   A BSM Group Parameters Route Type specific MCAST-VPN-BSR NLRI consists of
   the following:
</t>
<figure>
<artwork>
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   RD   (8 octets)                   |
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   len of BSR Address (1 octet)      |
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   BSR Address (Variable length)     |
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   len of Group Address (1 Octet)    |
      +-------------------------------------+
      | Group Prefix (Encoded Group format) |
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   Originating PE's IP Address       |
      +-------------------------------------+
</artwork>
</figure>
<t>
Group prefix can contain IPv6 or IPv4 address. Similar to RP Address, this can be determined by 
"len of Group Address" field. A value of 32 indicates IPv4 and 128 indicates IPv6 Group prefix.
Note that the length only indicates the length of the Group address amd not the encoded group prefix.
</t>
<t>
Encoded Group prefix format is defined in PIM-SM specification <xref target='RFC4601'/> and the same
is extracted from the BSM message and is placed in this NLRI. Along with the group prefix, the encoded
group format also contains important information such as 'BiDir' and Admin Scope zone which needs to be
carried across to the egress PEs.
</t>
<t>
The usage and details of this NLRI is discussed in "Protocol Details" section.
</t>
</section>
<section title="BSM RP Parameters NLRI">
<t>
   A BSR RP Parameters Route Type specific MCAST-VPN-BSR NLRI consists of

      +-------------------------------------+	  
      |   Originating PE's IP Address       |
      +-------------------------------------+
</artwork>
</figure>
<t>
RP Address is in Encoded unicast format as defined in PIM-SM specification <xref target='RFC4601'/> and the same
is extracted from the BSM message and is placed in this NLRI.
</t>
<t>
Hold Time is a 2 octet value in seconds, as defined in BSR specification <xref target='RFC5059'/>.
It is a per RP value which is taken from the BSM and filled in the NLRI by the originating router.
</t>
<t>
The usage and details of this NLRI is discussed in "Protocol Details" section.
</t>
</section>
<section title="BSR-BGP Path Attribute">
<t>
This document defines and uses a new BGP attribute called the "BSR-BGP attribute".  This
is an optional transitive BGP attribute.  The format of this attribute is defined as follows:
</t>
<figure>
<artwork>
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   Fragment Tag (2 Octets)           |
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   Group Count  (1 Octet)            |
      +-------------------------------------+
      |   RP Count  (1 Octet)               |
      +-------------------------------------+
</artwork>
</figure>
<t>
All MCAST-VPN-BSR NLRI route types carry the BSR-BGP Path attribute. However, based on the route-type the corresponding fields are set.
Fragment Tag MUST be set by all 3 route types. The usage of Fragment Tag is discussed in the details section. 
</t>
<t>
BSR Parameters NLRI also sets the Group Count field indicating the number of Groups this BSM is carrying. RP Count is not used by the
originator of BSR Parameters NLRI and SHOULD be ignored by the receiver of BSR Parameters NLRI. 
</t>
<t>
BSM Multicast Group Parameters NLRI sets the RP Count indicating the number of RPs that this Group carries. The Group Count for this NLRI 
is not set and SHOULD be ignored by the receiver of BSM MUlticast Group Parameters NLRI
</t>
<t>
BSM RP parameters NLRI sets only the Fragment Tag. Group Count and RP Count fields are not set by the originator and SHOULD be ignored by 
the receiver of BSM RP Parameters NLRI.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Protocol Overview">
<t> 
   In this section, we will discuss the overview of the mechanism to carry BSR through BGP.
The full specification will be discussed in the next section. The actual processing of BSR message 
is not changed by this specification for BSR messages sent/received on PE-CE links. i.e. the way BSR is elected based on 
BSM or RP selection procedure will continue to follow the BSR specification. This document only describes how the information 
carried in BSR is redistributed into BGP at the ingress PEs, and how the remote PEs redistribute this information from BGP back 
into BSR. The same applies when the PE itself is configured as C-RP or BSR for the given VRF. When the PE is C-RP, the RP 
advertisements are unicasted to the elected BSR based on the BSR specification. When the PE is configured as BSR for a 
specific MVPN VRF, it MUST originate the BSMs as it would normally do and send them towards CE facing interfaces. PE also 
originates MVPN-MCAST-BSR NLRIs from the RP-Set it created by virtue of being a BSR and advertises them to other remote PEs.

</t>
<section title="Handling Bootstrap messages">
<t>
BSR specification can be broadly classified into 3 stages:
</t>
<t>
<list style="format (%c)">
<t>
BSR election
</t>
<t>
Candidate RP advertisements
</t>
<t>
Elected BSR (E-BSR) advertising the RP-Set information
</t>
</list>
</t>
   
<t>
Candidate RP advertisements are unicasted and hence it is not necessary to carry them in PMSI tunnels or 
convert them into BGP routes. On the other hand, both the empty BSMs and the BSMs sent by the Elected BSRs (E-BSR)
needs to be converted into BGP routes.
</t>
<section title="Data for BSR Parameters Route">
<t>
The Bootstrap Router (BSR) election is based on the Bootstrap Message (BSM) transmitted with BSR priority,
by the candidate BSRs. Whenever a PE receives a BSM on a PE-CE link, it needs to originate a BSR Parameters Route with the
BSR Address and Priority extracted from the BSM. The BSR election on the PEs is done based on BSR Parameters 
Route received. BSR Parameters Route also MUST contain the BSR-BGP Path Attribute with Fragment-Tag and "Group Count" 
fields set. "Group Count" is the number of Group prefixes this BSM is carrying. The "Group Count" field is not present
in the original BSR specification and needs to be populated by the originating PE.
The Fragment Tag field can be any locally generated unique value at the originating PE. The usage of this field is 
discussed in the next section.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Fragmented BSMs" anchor="sec_frag">
<t>
BSR specification also provides a way to deal with fragmentation such that, if number of group-to-rp mappings exceed
the packet size, semantic fragmentation is performed. 'Fragment tag' in the BSM distinguishes the fragments
of the same BSM. If the fragmentation boundary happens to be within a group prefix, the difference of "RP Count" 
and "Frag RP Cnt" in the BSM determines how many more RPs are to come. When the fragmentation boundary falls at the 
group prefix (i.e a group range is fit entirely into a BSM fragment), then there is no way to determine if more such 
fragments are coming in other BSMs. An originating PE SHOULD wait for all the fragmented BSMs to arrive before propagating 
the same in BGP, if it is known that more fragments are coming based on "Frag RP Cnt" value. Otherwise, the PE SHOULD start 
converting the mappings into BGP NLRIs and advertise the routes as soon as the first BSM is received. The receiving PE will 
start assembling the RP-Set based on the received Group-to-RP mapping routes and send the resulting BSM to the CE. 
In the event of originating PE receiving subsequent fragments of the same BSM, it MUST advertise "BSR Parameters" NLRI 
with change in BSR-BGP path attribute reflecting the modified "Group Count". However, the existing "BSM Group Parameters" and 
"BSM RP Parameters" routes are still considered valid and the new routes are to be treated as incremental routes by the egress PE. 
This is possible because the Fragment tag value is same for the new mappings in the subsequent fragment. The details of this are 
discussed in the next section.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Mappings arriving in different BGP UPDATES">
<t>
Even without fragmentation, all the Group-to-RP mappings may not fit a single BGP UPDATE message at the originating PE. The NLRIs
can be split and sent into multiple BGP UPDATE messages. In such a situation, egress PEs can know whether all the mappings are recieved by using the 
"Group Count" and the "RP Count" in the "BSR-BGP" Path attributes present in the BSR Parameters and BSM Group Parameters NLRIs respectively.
BGP Graceful Restart (GR) specification <xref target='RFC4724'/> also proposes End-Of-RIB marker that can be used for non GR purpose. 
PEs MAY use End-Of-RIB marker to indicate the completion of all the route updates to the peer. The peer to the ingress PE can be a BGP 
route reflector. If negotiated for the MCAST-MVPN-BSR family, a BGP peer SHOULD wait for the End-of-RIB from the peer before advertising 
it to the other clients. Egress PE SHOULD wait for the End-Of-RIB marker before considering the routes for BSM Group-to-RP mapping calculation 
and informing its corresponding CEs.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title = "Mapping individual groups to RP">

<t>
For a router or management system to determine the RP mapping for an individual multicast stream,
the "PIM Group-to-Rendezvous-Point Mapping" specification <xref target='RFC6226'/> 
requires that the following be evaluated in addition to any 
dynamic Group-to-RP mappings: source-specific multicast (SSM) group ranges, dense mode (DM) 
group-ranges, embedded-RP encoded in the IPv6 group address, and statically configured Group-to-RP mappings.
This specific Group-to-RP mapping given by the algorithm in RFC6226 determines the RP that a router would use
for joining PIM shared trees or sending PIM Register messages for individual streams.
</t>

<t>
In addition to the dynamic RP group-range-to-RP mappings obtainable from BGP, 
a router or management system that needs to make these specific group-to-RP mapping decisions for
individual streams is assumed to have knowledge of the same information required by RFC6226 as all the
routers in the multicast domain. Specifically, it must know the source-specific multicast (SSM) group ranges, 
dense mode (DM)  group-ranges, embedded-RP encoded in the IPv6 group address, 
and statically configured group-range-to-RP mappings. How it learns these is outside the scope of
this document.
</t>
</section>
<section title = "Triggered BSMs by egress PE">
<t>
Unlike the regular BSR implementations where the BSM is flooded, egress PE in this implementation is acting as a proxy and generating BSMs.
An egress PE MUST generate BSMs periodically from the mapping information taken from the MCAST-VPN-BSR NLRIs. In addition to the periodic BSMs, 
whenever there is a change in BSM mapping, a triggered BSM MUST be generated which will then refresh the information on the CE. Ingress PE and 
egress PE may not be in sync with each other in terms of timing. Assume that periodic BSM is sent at t=0 and it received a change in BGP route 
with one RP withdrawn. In this case, an egress PE generates a new BSM without waiting for BS_Period to expire. There MUST however be a 
minimum of BS_Min_Interval time between each time a BSM is sent as noted in <xref target='RFC5059'/>. This will cause an extra 
BSM to be generated towards the CE whenever there is a change in Group-to-RP mapping in the egress PE. 
</t>
</section>

<section title = "Reverse Path Forwarding for Dynamic RP advertisements">
<t>
BSR relies on variations of Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) to ensure
that advertisement messages do not loop through the network. RPF delivery semantics must 
also be maintained across the BGP-MVPN service provider core for dynamic RP advertisements 
encoded in BGP.
</t>

<t>
The BGP NLRI to be defined for dynamic RP advertisements includes a Originating PE's IP address
field which can be used by PEs receiving advertisements via BGP to conduct RPF checks 
when handling these advertisements. When a PE receives the MCAST-VPN-BSR NLRI for a particular MVPN from some
other PE, the PE accepts the message only if the 'Originating PE's IP address' field is the selected
upstream PE for the IP address of the Bootstrap router. Otherwise, the PE simply discards the update. 
</t>
</section>

<section title = "Interoperation with tunneled BSR">
<t>
In order for this specification to be incrementally deployable in a network, PEs that implement
this specification must be able to interoperate with PEs that do not. Such PEs that are not 
capable of advertising dynamic RP information in BGP will send tunneled BSR messages.
</t>

<t>
For example, it is possible that a BSR router could be multihomed to multiple
PEs, some of which advertise dynamic RP mappings in BGP and some of which encapsulate the native
packets. In such a topology, it's possible that each of the PEs connecting the site of the 
BSR sender will forward the redundant advertisements for the same sender to the other PEs 
across the core via the different protocol mechanisms. 
Further, it is possible that different senders are connected to PEs with differing capabilities 
and unique advertisements will arrive from the core at PEs via different protocol mechanisms.
</t>

<t>
In these scenarios in which there are non-capable PEs in the network, 
PEs sending dynamic RP advertisements via BGP may also choose
to encapsulate the same advertisements as native BSR packets tunnel via the 
PMSIs of the BGP-MVPN for delivery to receiving PEs that are not capable of handling
the dynamic RP advertisements from BGP. However, when it is known that ALL PEs are
capable of dynamic RP advertisements in BGP, PEs should filter multicasted BSR 
messages such that they are not encapsulated in PMSI tunnels.
</t>

<t>
PEs receiving dynamic RP advertisements from the service provider core
must apply RPF rules to the received advertisements regardless of the mechanism of delivery. 
Propagation of native BSR encapsulated advertisements by receiving PEs enabled for 
dynamic RP advertisements in BGP should occur as if these advertisements were received from BGP,
and as specified in this document.
</t>

<section title = "Route Targets for Group-to-RP mapping routes">
<t>
By default the Group-to-RP mapping routes SHOULD have the same Route Targets as the VPN-IP unicast routes towards 
BSR/Mapping Agent/C-RP carried in these routes. An implementation SHOULD allow to modify the default via configuration.
With the use of Route Target Constraint <xref target='RFC4684'/>, the distribution of these routes can be controlled 
to only those PEs who have the RT configured.
</t>
</section>

<section title = "BSR multihomed">
<t>
When a BSR is multihomed, say to two PEs, both the PEs will originate the MCAST-VPN-BSR NLRIs. In such a case, egress PEs
SHOULD take the NLRIs from the PE based on single forwarder selection procedure described in section 9.1.2 of <xref target='RFC6513'/>.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Protocol Details">

<section title="Originating Group-to-RP Mapping route for bootstrap messages received on a VRF">
<t>
When a PE router receives a BSM message on its CE facing interface that is the RPF towards the BSR or configures an RP 
locally and is the elected BSR, the router will add the mappings to the local copy of Group-to-RP set. The PE router 
will then form BGP NLRIs as mentioned in the previous section based on the received BSR message. The PE router will determine if 
there were any previous advertisements from the same BSR and if there is any change in the BSM content. If the routes are already 
advertised and is not changed as a result of the BSR message, then the same is not re-advertised in BGP. Refer to section 3.4 of 
BSR specification <xref target='RFC5059'/> for forwarding the received BSR messages. Unless the BSR implementation requires 
a particular BSM to be blocked, BSR messages needs to be forwarded via BGP to the egress PEs.
</t>

<t>
In the case where a new BSR has come up, it generates a BSM with empty content. In such a case, only a "BSR Parameters" route  
is generated by the PE with BSR address and priority fields filled. Even if the BSR which sent empty BSM is not a preferred
BSR (the current EBSR is better), "BSR Parameters" NLRI MUST be generated with this BSR address and sent to the
remote PEs in order to maintain consistency with the BSR implementation. The local BSR implementation will take
care of chosing the right BSR.
</t>
<t>
If a PE is rebooted or newly added, it may receive a BSM with "No-Forward" bit set or a unicasted BSM from the CE
to which it formed PIM neighborship. In either case, PE MUST originate the required NLRIs from the BSM
and forward the same to the remote PEs. There is no need to carry "No-Forward" bit in BGP for this scenario.
</t>
<t>
As discussed in <xref target="sec_frag"/>, if the BSM is fragmented and if the fragmentation
boundary is at at group prefix, there is no way to tell whether more fragments will arrive. Hence, 
the BSR routes are advertised as soon as the BSM is received. If another BSM is received 
with  same "Fragment Tag" field at a later time, the BSR implementation treats this as part of the same
BSM that was received earlier. Hence, these BSMs are converted to the respective BSR NLRIs and advertised 
to the BGP peers. 
</t>
</section>
<section title="Handling changes in BSR messages" anchor="withdraw_bsm">

<t>
A PE router may need to withdraw a Group-to-RP mapping for which it has originated an 
advertisement based on several conditions. If a BSM is received from a CE with a holdtime of zero for the 
mapping, or if a local PE is BSR and an RP is unconfigured, then the advertisement MUST be withdrawn immediately.

In addition, scenarios such as a BSM missing an RP mapping entry or missing BSMs entirely may necessitate 
withdrawal of advertised mappings. A change may also happen to a group, where a new group may get added 
or existing group may be removed. These needs to be propagated accordingly through BGP.

</t>

<section title="Missing RP or Group mapping entry">
<t>
Assume a scenario where a given Group prefix had 100 RPs in the received BSM from a BSR. In the next periodic update
after BS_Period interval, only 99 RPs are present for that group. This can happen when an RP did not 
go down gracefully (i.e, it did not advertise with Hold Timer = 0). The BSR implementation on the PE will continue 
to keep the RP mapping until the "RP Hold Time" expires. However, this needs to be communicated via BGP.  
</t>
<t>
In this scenario, originating PE will continue to keep the "BSR Parameters" route unchanged. The "BSM Group Parameters"
route for the respective group is re-advertised with change in the "RP Count" value in the BSR-BGP path attribute.
"Fragment Tag" field in the path attribute MUST NOT be changed. Along with that, the respective "BSM RP Parameters" route (Type-3) MUST
be withdrawn. 
</t>
<t> 
Egress PE receiving a changed Type-2 route (BSM Group Parameters) MUST wait until the RP count matches before generating the 
BSM towards the CE with this change. In case the "End-Of-RIB" is negotiated, this check SHOULD be performed only after the "End-Of-RIB" is received.
The RP will not be removed from the local group-to-rp mapping table until the RP hold time expires. BSM that is advertised 
towards the CE is changed to reflect the missing RP. This scenario also handles any out of sequence messages arising. For example, 
if Type-3 (BSM RP Parameters) withdrawal comes before the changed Type-2 (BSM Group Parameters), the RP count check would fail 
making the egress PE wait until the update is complete. 
</t>
<t>
Another scenario to consider  is when a RP for a group is removed and a new RP is added. In this case, the "RP Count" remains same, but
the BSM RP Parameters route (Type-3) corresponding to old RP is withdrawn, and Type-3 for new RP is advertised. Even if these two arrive in two different
BGP updates, the corresponding checks at egress PE will ensure that a BSM is triggered only when the Type-3s for the group is matched with
the RP count in the corresponding BSM Group Parameters route (Type-2). 
</t>
<t>
Consider another scenario where initially the Group Count was 100. The new BSM received has the same Group Count, but one 
group removed and a new group added. In this situation, an ingress PE need not generate a new "BSR Parameters" (Type-1) route since
the group count did not change. For the group which was removed from the BSM, the corresponding Type-2 route and its Type-3 routes MUST 
be withdrawn and a new BSM Group parameters route (Type-2) route with its RP parameters route (Type-3) MUST be advertised. At the egress
PE, as soon as the Type-2 withdrawal comes, all the corresponding RP entries (Type-3) are placed as inactive and MUST not be considered, 
irrespective of whether a withdrawal for those routes are received or not. However, PEs SHOULD keep those routes 
until the actual withdrawals arrive.  The "Group Count" and its "RP Count" per group are to be matched before BSM is generated towards the CE.
</t>
<t>
Lastly, consider a scenario where a new Group is added over the existing entries. In this case, the "BSR Parameters" route is re-advertised
with modified "Group Count" value, keeping the "Fragment Tag" same. Along with that, "BSM Group Parameters" route and "BSM RP Parameters"
route are generated for the new Group and RPs. Again, the egress PE MUST wait for the values to match before generating the BSM towards egress.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Missing BSM">
<t>
Like missing a particular mapping, missing an entire BSM can also happen due to several reasons. It could be that the BSR
went down ungracefully or BSM is missed due to congestion. BSR specification <xref target='RFC5059'/>
defines a timer BS_Timeout (defaults to 2*BS_Period + 10 seconds) before declaring a BSR as dead and electing a new BSR.
While most of the scenarios are taken care by the local BSR implementation on the PEs, we need to handle communicating the missing BSM 
between the PEs through BGP. In the scenario of missing BSM, the corresponding "BSR Parameters" (Type-1) route is withdrawn, however the
corresponding "BSM Group Parameters" route (Type-2) and "BSM RP Parameters" route (Type-3) entries MUST NOT be withdrawn by the ingress PE. 
</t>
<t>
Egress PE receiving a withdrawn "BSR Parameters" route (Type-1) MUST still keep the corresponding Type-2 and Type-3 entries. However, it MUST NOT 
advertise the BSM to the CE without the Type-1 route present. As soon as the Type-1 is withdrawn, BS_Timeout period has to be started
at the egress and upon its expiry, all the Type-2 and Type-3 entries MUST be deleted. 
</t>
<t>
Say the egress has generated BSM at t=0. At t=1 BS_Period expired at ingress PE and ingress PE did not get the periodic BSM. So, it withdraws 
type-1 (BSR Parameters). Egress PE has already generated BSM just before the type-1 withdrawal was received. The egress PE skips the next periodic 
BSM towards the CE. But CE is "off" by BS_Period interval by now. Once the BS_Timeout expires, egress PE removes all the type-2 and type-3 entries. 
CEs connected to egress PE will remove the same, a whole BS_Period later. Hence, to avoid this issue, once the BS_Timeout expires,an egress PE MUST 
generate a new BSM towards CE with RP hold time set to "0" for all the type-2 and type-3 entries. This will make the CEs in sync with the the PEs.
After generating the BSM, PE removes all the Type-2 and Type-3 entries as stated above.
</t>
<t>
After the BSR is timed out (after BS_Timeout), when a new BSM comes from the same BSR, a new "Fragment Tag" MUST be generated by the ingress PE.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Change of Elected BSR">
<t>
As per the BSR specification <xref target='RFC5059'/>, when a preferred BSM is received, the current 'Elected BSR' will transfer 
its state to 'Candidate BSR' and forward the received BSM. All the routers will also change the elected BSR based on the preferred BSM. 
When an originating PE's local bootstrap module elects a new BSR, all the old Group-to-RP mapping entries advertised by the previous BSR MUST be
withdrawn. 
</t>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Receiving Group-to-RP Mapping routes for BSR">
<t>
The PEs receiving the BGP Group-to-RP Mapping route NLRIs will act as a proxy. First step is to check if the received
routes are valid. If the "Fragment Tag" present in the "BSR Parameters" route does not match with the "BSM Group Parameters" (Type-2)
and "BSM RP Parameters" (Type-3) routes, then those entries are considered invalid. Similarly, if the 
len of BSR/RP/Group Address field contains any value other than "0","32" or "128" it MUST be considered as a malformed message
and MUST be discarded. The PE MUST also run a RPF check for the BSR IP address and see if the originating PE address 
is the router through which the BSR is reachable. If the preferred route to the BSR is through the core, RPF check is 
done as per the MVPN upstream multicast hop (UMH) selection described in MVPN specification <xref target='RFC6513'/>. 
If the advertising PE is not the PE matching UMH selection, or if the preferred route to the BSR is through one of the 
CE interfaces, the RPF check fails and the routes MUST be ignored.
</t>
<t>
The receiving PE collects the Group-to-RP mapping routes per BSR IP address and makes an entry in its BSR Group-to-RP mapping table. 
From the Group-to-RP mapping per BSR, the egress PE forms a BSM message. In order to generate the BSM message, the PE
need to construct certain fields such as Checksum which is not available in the advertised NLRIs. 
</t>
<t>
Unlike CE PIM routers, the PE receiving Group-to-RP mapping routes via BGP will not receive periodic soft-state 
refreshes of the mappings every BS_Period. The receiving PE MUST generate periodic BSMs every BS_Period as specified 
in the BSR RFC <xref target='RFC5059'/>. When there is a change in the corresponding Group-to-RP mapping routes, a fresh 
BSM MUST be triggered after the calculation of "Group Count" and "RP Count" matches. Egress PE MUST also ensure that
there is a minimum period of BS_Min_Interval between each time a BSM is sent towards the CE as noted in BSR 
specification <xref target='RFC5059'/>.
</t>
<t>
When a "BSR Parameters" (Type-1) route is received with "Group Count" as 0, the PE MUST treat it as an empty
BSM. An empty BSM MUST be formed and sent to the CEs with other relevant fields populated. Other aspects of electing
a BSR based on the BSR priority MUST be same as what is specified in the BSR specification <xref target='RFC5059'/>.
</t>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
Since a BSR message allows semantic fragmentation, a message can be very big with lot of mappings there by leading to PE generating
several Group-to-RP mapping route NLRIs. An implementation SHOULD be able to restrict the number of Groups and RP mappings allowed on
a VRF or interface level so that the number of BGP routes generated for the mapping are controlled. 
</t>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>
   This document defines a new NLRI, called MCAST-VPN-BSR, to be carried in
   BGP using multiprotocol extensions. It requires assignment of a new
   SAFI.

   This document defines a new BGP optional transitive attribute, called
   BSR-BGP.
