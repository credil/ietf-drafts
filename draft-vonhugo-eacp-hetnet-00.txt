Internet-Draft     Energy Aware Control Approach for QoS       July 2013


1.  Introduction

   Major challenge for carrier grade network operators trying to reduce
   power consumption in the access domain is to grant customer
   satisfaction in terms of only minimum degraded service quality. This
   requires the network to meet the specified and agreed performance
   figures demanded by various applications using network connectivity.
   Energy saving by load-adaptive provision of transmission capacity in
   terms of switch-on and -off of resources (nodes, lines, node
   components) or dynamic invocation of sleep modes may introduce
   performance loss caused by the overhead involved for re-activation
   and reconfiguration.  Therefore intelligent mechanisms for network
   operation control have to be applied to find optimum decision in
   terms of timeliness and accuracy to perform the reconfigurations
   such that the actually provided capacity ensures as much as possible
   a successful transmission of user traffic demand at required quality.

   Degradations in user perceived service quality depend on the service
   specific requirements in terms of e.g. bandwidth, packet loss rate,
   delay and delay variations which are governed both by the kind of
   service (e.g. audio, video, file transfer, ...) as well as equipment
   and application software specific measures to cope with network
   performance variations.  Thus for video streaming services such as
   IPTV countermeasures to cope with variable bandwidth and delay are
   implemented such as buffers to store data (see e.g [4]).

   This draft reports an approach following the considerations and
   requirements laid out in [2] to counteract the potential impact due
   to energy aware network operation, which is represented as bandwidth
   reduction, introduced stretch/delay, decreased recovery speed,
   additional jitter/delay variations, and other operational aspects.

   Issues of power-aware routing and traffic engineering have already
   been considered in [8] and [9] in detail.

3.  Energy aware network model

   The proposed concept for load adaptive energy aware access networks
   follows a model similar to [2] where the following measures are
   described as primary ways to reduce energy usage 

   o  Removing redundant links from the network topology
   o  Removing redundant network equipment from the network topology
   o  Reducing the amount of time equipment or links are operational
   o  Reducing the link speed or processing rate of equipment

   Considerations here shall focus on a network for fixed and mobile 
   services such as DSL-based (digital subscriber line) fixed access as
   described by BBF or a cellular access network as specified by 3GPP.
   Technology specific approaches towards an energy aware operation are
   laid out e.g. in [3] for mobile access where some cells providing
   additional capacity are proposed to be switched off for reasons of
   power consumption optimization in case they are no longer needed.
   Important is that both continuity of radio coverage and service QoS
   remains guaranteed. 

   A local-autonomous solution for fixed DSL networks' energy efficiency  
   improvements is laid out e.g. in [10] where the data rate and the
   power consumption associated with it are adapted to real traffic
   demands observed on a particular access line by means of defined
   bit rate and power modes. 
 
   A multi-link heterogeneous access network consisting of multiple
   radio access technologies (Multi-RAT) such as cellular mobile and
   WiFi is able to provide an end user equipment (UE) with multiple 
   links concurrently or subsequently to enable continuous network 
   connectivity.  Depending on current load within an area of coverage
   (radio cell) part of the access nodes (i.e. radio base stations and
   WiFi access points) are temporarily switched off either completely
   or partially thus realizing the above mentioned measures. 

   Similarly, a hybrid fixed-radio access network is conceivable where  
   the specifics of the per-technology power management solutions have  
   to be taken into account and in addition they have to be coordinated.

   The simplistic network model used in [2] is shown in Figure 1.

   Corresponding to this model here the access network part is described
   with R1 as the UE connected to different access routers R2, R3 (or
   AR1, AR2) which are attached to a common aggregation node R4 (AGR)
   connected to the serving gateway to the core network, R5 (GW) via at
   least two redundant links.

   Task of the control plane to prevent ongoing sessions from negative
   impact of network performance variations to user perceived service
   quality or Quality of Experience (QoE) is to detect and counteract 
   those variations resulting in bandwidth reduction, and additional
   delay and jitter.  On the other hand a decreased recovery speed in
   case of (e.g. failure caused) loss of remaining redundant links and
   nodes is more a network operational issue with impact on network
   availability and reliability.
 
   The approach described here focusses on the well known situation
   that a network is dimensioned so to provide enough capacity to serve
   all users and services expected in so-called busy hours when multiple
   users are concurrently active at peak demands.  During off-peak time
   the demanded network load is low so that part of the network in terms
   of access nodes and routers can be operated in sleep mode or switched
   off partially or completely.

   For a cellular network we therefore may assume that a UE is
   potentially being served by at least two such access nodes whereas in
   a fixed network customer nodes can be switched to low power mode
   reducing capacity and energy consumption both at the UE and in the
   the AR (here: DSL Access Multiplexer, DSLAM).  Such a behaviour is
   denoted as load adaptive network reconfiguration.

   The concept allowing for adaptive reconfiguration is based on
   reliable measurement of actual traffic demand and subsequent decision
   on corresponding configuration actions.  Therefore a data base and
   decision engine is employed to collect and analyse context
   information allowing for best decisions on changes in network
   topology and configuration.  An optimization is achieved when
   provided capacity follows as much as possible the traffic demand with
   as little overprovisioning as possible to grant energy efficient
   operation and account for enough margin to cope with traffic demand
   uncertainties in terms of load variability to prevent perceivable
   quality degradations.

   Such quality impact may be introduced by network performance
   degradations in terms of congestion and bandwidth reduction in case
   of mismatch between capacity and demand.  In addition the energy
   aware network operation may introduce bandwidth reduction, stretch/
   delay, additional jitter/delay variations as laid out in [2].  In a
   cellular system additional delay or even loss of connectivity due to
   handover of an UE between neighboring access nodes may occur when the
   currently serving node is going to energy save state.  New proposals
   for mobility management taking into account both low handover delay
   and resource efficient operation are under way in WG DMM (Distributed
   Mobility Management) [5].

   Impact of all these parameters on different services according to
   their requirements have to be considered and counteracted for
   customer satisfaction.  A communication network operating in an
   energy aware mode SHOULD apply additional measures to keep track of
   network node and link states as well as of service related network
   performance to minimize risk of degradations in service quality. 

   One approach is to apply a dedicated control protocol or enhance
   existing ones to take into account both the network status and the
   service demand to assign the required network resources.  This can be
   done in terms of prioritization of critical sessions and
   corresponding de-priorisation of more robust ones in terms of
   performance parameters under stress.  E.g. in case of switching on
   new equipment to provide additional capacity the introduced delay
   variation may be counteracted by providing spare capacity for those
   services which are highly sensitive to delay variations.

   In this context a QoS attribute and corresponding parameters MAY have
   to be applied to flows of active sessions such as proposed in [11].

   Furthermore energy related information on network devices as defined
   in [12] for network management purposes SHOULD be incorporated in a
   concept to control assessment of QoS requirements of different
   services with respect to impact of energy aware networks.

5.  Security Considerations

   Security is an important issue in access to communication networks 
   both in fixed-line networks and for mobile and wireless ones as
   described e.g. in [5] such that any proposed protocol must
   incorporate sufficiently strong protection mechanisms.  Beside that
   to our knowledge no new security risks are introduced with this
   concept.
