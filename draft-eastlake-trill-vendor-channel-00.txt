             TRILL: Vendor Specific TRILL Channel Protocol
              <draft-eastlake-trill-vendor-channel-00.txt>


Abstract

   The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
   protocol is implemented by devices called TRILL switches or RBridges
   (Routing Bridges). TRILL includes a general mechanism, called RBridge
   Channel, for the transmission of typed messages between RBridges in
   the same campus and between RBridges and end stations on the same
   link. This document specifies how to send vendor specific messages
   over the RBridge Channel facility.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                     TRILL: Vendor Channel


1. Introduction

   The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
   protocol [RFC6325] is implemented by devices called TRILL switches or
   RBridges. It provides efficient least cost transparent frame routing
   in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and link
   technologies, using link-state routing and a hop count. Links between
   TRILL switches can be arbitrary technology and, in general, the TRILL
   way to address or specify a TRILL switch (RBridge) in the interior of
   a TRILL campus is by its TRILL provided nickname [RFC6325]
   [ClearCorrect].

   The TRILL protocol includes an RBridge Channel facility [RFCchannel]
   to support typed message transmission between RBridges in the same
   campus and between RBridges and end stations on the same link. This
   document specifies a method of sending messages specific to a
   particular organization, indicated by OUI (Organizationally Unique
   Identifier [RFC5342]), over the RBridge Channel facility.

   Such organization specific messages can be used for vendor specific
   diagnotic or experimental messages.



1.1 Terminology and Acronyms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses the acronyms defined in [RFC6325] supplemented by
   the following additional acronym:

      OUI - Organizationally Unique Identifier [RFC5342]

TRILL switch - An alternative term for an RBridge

2. Vendor Channel Packet Format

   The general structure of an RBridge Channel packet on a link between
   RBridges (TRILL switches) is shown in Figure 1 below. When an RBridge
   Channel message is sent between an RBridge and an end station on the
   same link, in either direction, the TRILL Header is omitted. The type
   of RBridge Channel packet is given by a Protocol field in the RBridge
   Channel Header which indicates how to interpret the Channel Protocol
   Specific Payload. See [RFCchannel].

                Figure 2. Channel Tunnel Message Structure

   The fields in Figure 2 related to the Vendor RBridge Channel Protocol
   are as follows:

      Channel Protocol:  The RBridge Channel Protocol value allocated
         for Vendor Channel (see Section 4).

      OUI:  The field indicates the vendor specifying the particular use
         or uses of the Vendor Channel. The vendor to whom the OUI in
         this field has been allocated is in charge of specifying Vendor
         Channel messages using their OUI.

      VERR:  Vendor Channel Error. See Section 3.

      Sub-Protocol: Actually, the vendor specifying their use of the
         Vendor Channel can do whatever they want with the bits after
         the VERR field. But it is strongly recommended that they use
         the sub-protocol / sub-version fields so that multiple and
         evolving uses can be specified based on a single OUI.

      Sub-Version: See explanation above of the Sub-Protocol field. This
         field is provided to indicate the version of the particuar
         vendor's Sub-Protocol.

3. Vendor Channel Errors

   The VERR field values from 0x0 through 0xF inclusive are reserved for
   specification by the IETF. See Section 4.  All other non-zero values
   of VERR are available for whatever use the vendor specifies except
   that a Vendor Channel implementation MUST NOT send a Vendor Channel
   Error in response to a Vendor Channel message with a non-zero VERR
   field.

   The IETF specified VERR values thus far are as follows:

   0. The VERR field is zero in Vendor Channel messages unless the the
      Vendor Channel packet is reporting an error.

   1. The value one indicate that the OUI field value is unknown. If an
      RBridge implements the Vendor Channel facility and receives a
      Vendor Channel packet with a zero VERR field and an OUI field it
      does not recognize and the SL flag is zero in the RBridge Channel
      Header, it MUST set the VERR field to the value one and returns
      the packet as described in Section 3.1.

   2. The value two indicates that the Sub-Protocol field value is
      unknown. If an RBridge implements the Vendor Channel facility and
      receives a Vendor Channel packet with a zero VERR field and zero
      SL flag in the RBridge Channel Header, an OUI that it implements,
      but a Sub-Protocol fields value it does not recongize, it SHOULD
      set the VERR field to the value two and returns the packet as
      described in Section 3.1.

   3. The value three indicates that the Sub-Version field value is
      unknown. If an RBridge implements the Vendor RBridge Channel
      facility and receives a Vendor Channel packet with a zero VERR
      field and zero SL flag in the RBridge Channel Header, an OUI and
      Sub-Protocol that it implements, but a Sub-Version fields value it
      does not recongize, it SHOULD set the VERR field to the value
      three and returns the packet as described in Section 3.1.



3.1 Sending an Error Response

   The IETF specified Vendor Channel error response are sent in response
   to a received RBridge Channel packet by setting the VERR field as
   specified above and modifying the packet as specified below.

      The RBridge Channel Header is modified by setting the SL flag.
      (The ERR field will be zero because, if it was non-zero, the
      packet would have been handled at the RBridge Channel rather than
      being passed down to the Vendor Channel level.)

INTERNET-DRAFT                                     TRILL: Vendor Channel


      o  If Vendor Channel message was sent between RBridges, the TRILL
         Header is modified by clearing the M bit, setting the egress
         nickname to the ingress nickname as received, and setting the
         ingress nickname to a nickname held by the TRILL switch sending
         the error packet.

      o If Vendor Channel message was sent between an RBridge and an end
         station in either direction, the outer MAC addresses are
         modified by setting the Outer.MacDA to the Outer.MacSA as
         received, and the Outer.MacSA is set to the MAC address of the
         port of the TRILL switch or end station sending the error
         packet.

      o  The priority of the error response message MAY be reduced from
         the priority of the Vendor Chanel messge causing the error,
         unless it was already minimum priority, and MAY set the Drop
         Eligibility Indicator bit in an error response. (Priorities are
         ordered from highest to lowest as 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 0, and 1.
         See Section 4.1.1, [RFC6325].)

   It is generally anticipated that the entire packet in which an error
   was detected would be sent back, modified as above, so that, for
   example, error responses could more easily be matched with messages
   sent; however, this is really up to the vendor specifying how their
   Vendor RBridge Channel messages are to be used.

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate TBD for Vendor Specific RBridge Channel
   Protocol from the range of RBridge Channel protocols allocated by
   Standards Action.

   IANA is requested to establish a "Vendor RBridge Channel Error Codes"
   registry with initial entries as follows:

          Code      Description                      Reference
          ----      -----------                      ---------
            0       No error                         This document
            1       Unknown OUI                      This document
            2       Unknown Sub-Protocol             This document
            3       Unknown Sub-Version              This document
         0x04-0x0F  Allocated by Standards Action    -
         0x10-0xFF  Reserved for vendor use          This document

5. Security Considerations

   See [RFC6325] for general TRILL Secuirty Considerations.

   See [RFCchannel] for general RBridge Channel Security Considerations.

   The Vendor Specific RBridge Channel Protocol provides no security
   assurances or features. Any needed security could be provided by
   fields or processing within the Vendor Protocol Specific Data, which
   is outside the scope of this document. Alternatively, use of Vendor
   Channel could be nested inside the RBridge Channel Tunnel Protocol
   [RFCtunnel] which can provide some security services.
