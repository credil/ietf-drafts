1.  Introduction

   The IS-IS [ISO10589] routing protocol has been widely used in
   Internet Service Provider IP/MPLS networks.  Operational experience
   with the protocol, combined with ever increasing requirements for
   lossless operations have demonstrated some operational issues.  This
   document describes those issues and some mechanisms for dealing with
   those issues.  These mechanisms do involve implementation support,
   but do not require protocol changes.

1.1.  Interface Shutdown Black Hole

   One of these operationally problematic issues occurs when IS-IS is
   disabled on only one side of a link.  This can result in a
   significant delay before neighbor(s) on the other end of the same
   link notice this change.  In turn, this can result in several seconds
   during which traffic is blackholed, until the IS-IS neighbor(s) time
   out the adjacency and IS-IS reconverges.

1.2.  LAN of Last Resort

   Another issue stems from a situation when operators want to
   temporarily make an interface a "last resort" link for transit
   traffic.  This is a straightforward, though cumbersome, operation to
   perform on a point-to-point link.  Each device on the link is
   reconfigured to use very high metric.  This causes traffic to divert
   to other links in the network.  This same operation is more difficult

   on a multi-access LAN.  There, the operator would have to increase
   the metric on each and every interface attached to the LAN, requiring
   the reconfiguration of a number of systems.

1.3.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Sending Hellos with Fast Exit Notification

   When an operator shuts down IS-IS on an interface, as described in
   Section 1.1, there is a significant interval before the change is
   noticed by all adjacencies and traffic is subsequently re-routed
   around this link.  This delay is unnecessary, as neighbors should not
   have to wait for the adjacency to timeout, particularly when there
   exist alternate, viable, paths to downstream neighbors.  This delay
   can be eliminated by carefully removing the adjacency between
   neighbors prior to actually disabling IS-IS on the interface.

   An IS-IS adjacency uses the 3-way handshake protocol as defined in
   [ISO10589] for multi-access LANs and [RFC3373] for point-to-point
   links.  In both cases, the IS to IS Hello (IIH) message is used to
   establish and maintain the adjacency carries the system identifier of
   the adjacent systems.  The receiving system expects to see its own
   system identifier listed.  If not, then it must drop the adjacency.

   An implementation that wishes to avoid the issue in Section 1.1 can
   do so by sending out a final IIH that includes no neighboring system
   IDs.  When this is received, it should cause all neighbors to drop
   their adjacencies with the router that sent the IIH.  This will also
   cause the systems to update their Link State Protocol Data Units
   (LSPs), flood them and reconverge to new paths.  The technique is
   known as Fast Exit Notification.

3.  Pseudonodes with Non-zero Metrics

   If an operator wishes to reconfigure a multi-access LAN so that it is
   only used as a resource of the last resort, then with current
   mechanisms, the operator must reconfigure each node on the LAN to
   give the LAN a high metric, as described in Section 1.2.  It would be
   much easier for the operator if they could make a single
   configuration change that would cause IS-IS to treat the multi-access
   LAN as a link of last resort.

   [ISO10589] defines the pseudonode LSP as having a metric of zero.
   This implies that during the Shortest Path First (SPF) calculation,



Shen, et al.            Expires August 18, 2013                 [Page 3]

   the metric for traversing the LAN is solely based on the metric set
   by the IS used to access the LAN.  Thereby, the pseudonode does not
   contribute to the cost of traversing the LAN.

   However, from the point of view of the SPF calculation, the metric in
   the pseudonode LSP does not have to be zero.  Instead, the metric in
   a pseudonode LSP could be treated just like a normal LSP and have
   non-zero metrics to some or all of the systems on the LAN.  This can
   then be used to simplify the operation for turning an entire LAN into
   a link of last resort.  This could be done by having the Designated
   Intermediate System (DIS) change all of the metrics within the
   pseudonode LSP to a high value.  This would effectively make the
   entire LAN look very 'expensive' and cause SPF calculations to
   converge to alternate links, if at all possible.

   This technique can also be used to divert traffic away from a subset
   of the nodes on the LAN.  If the DIS increases the metric from the
   pseudonode to a subset of the systems on the LAN, then traffic will
   avoid exiting the LAN via that subset of systems.

3.1.  Alternative Approaches

   An alternative is to allow any system to temporarily become the DIS,
   when it is directed to, and set a non-zero metric in the pseudonode
   LSP(s).  This is beneficial because the operator would otherwise
   first have to determine the current DIS, access that system and
   reconfigure it.  If an implementation wishes to support this, it can
   provide an operation that both changes its priority on the LAN, so
   that a node first becomes DIS, and then generates a new pseudonode
   LSP with the non-zero metric.

   If there is a concern that the DIS may change, it is prudent to
   define another node on the same LAN with the second highest priority
   for becoming DIS.  This node can be configured to also set the metric
   in its pseudonode LSP appropriately if it becomes the new DIS.

4.  Operational Considerations

4.1.  Operational Considerations: Fast Exit Notification

   The approach described in Section 2 is not guaranteed.  If the final
   IIH is lost on the link, then the neighboring systems will have to
   wait to time out the adjacency.  Since this is unlikely, it is still
   a useful optimization.  Implementations that require an even higher
   degree of assurance can retransmit the final IIH, possibly multiple
   times.

4.2.  Operational Considerations: Pseudonodes with Non-zero Metrics

   Because the change to the usage of the pseudonode LSP, as described
   in Section 3, is in direct contradiction to the existing IS-IS
   specification, extreme caution is necessary.  Implementations that
   would not interpret a non-zero pseudonode metric correctly might
   cause forwarding loops.  Operators should perform Lab testing and
   take caution when deploying this feature to ensure that nodes that
   receive a non-zero pseudonode metric will interpret it correctly.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues for IS-IS.
