This document describes a simple, interoperable mechanism that can be
employed in Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)
networks in order to decrease the data loss associated with
deterministic blackholing of packets during transient network
conditions.  The mechanism proposed here requires no IS-IS protocol
changes and is completely interoperable with the existing IS-IS
specification.
