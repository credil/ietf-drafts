    A Registry Investigation for IPPM Packet Delay Variation Metrics
                   draft-morton-ippm-registry-pdv-00

Abstract

   This memo investigates a scheme to organize registry entries,
   primarily those defined in RFCs prepared in the IP Performance
   Metrics (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF.  Three aspects make IPPM
   metric registration difficult: (1) Use of the Type-P notion to allow
   users to specify their own packet types. (2) Use of Flexible input
   variables, called Parameters in IPPM definitions, some which
   determine the quantity measured and others which should not be
   specified until execution of the measurement. (3) Allowing
   flexibility in choice of statistics to summarize the results on a
   stream of measurement packets.  Specifically, this memo investigates
   registry entries that would follow from RFC 3393, the specification
   IP Packet Delay Variation that allows for many different forms of
   unique metrics, as a difficult and important test of the registry
   structure.

1.  Introduction

   This memo investigates a scheme to organize registry entries,
   primarily those defined in RFCs prepared in the IP Performance
   Metrics (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF, according to their
   framework [RFC2330].  Three aspects make IPPM metric registration
   difficult: (1) Use of the Type-P notion to allow users to specify
   their own packet types. (2) Use of Flexible input variables, called
   Parameters in IPPM definitions, some which determine the quantity
   measured and others which should not be specified until execution of
   the measurement. (3) Allowing flexibility in choice of statistics to
   summarize the results on a stream of measurement packets.
   Specifically, this memo investigates registry entries that would
   follow from [RFC3393], the specification IP Packet Delay Variation
   that allows for many different forms of unique metrics, as a
   difficult and important test of the registry structure.

   Although there are several standard templates for organizing
   specifications of performance metrics (see [RFC2679] for an example
   of the traditional IPPM template, based to large extent on the
   Benchmarking Methodology Working Group's traditional template in
   [RFC1242], and [RFC6390] for a similar template), none of these
   templates were intended to become the basis for the columns of an
   IETF-wide registry of metrics.  As we examine the aspects of metric
   specifications which need to appear in the registry, we will see that
   none of the existing metric templates fully satisfies the needs of a
   registry.

   The authors of [draft-bagnulo-ippm-new-registry] and
   [draft-bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent] made important
   contributions to this memo in the registry column structure, and the
   problem of registry development in general.  We also acknowledge
   input from the authors of [draft-claise-ippm-perf-metric-registry],
   especially the value of an Element ID and the need for naming
   conventions.


2.  Scope

   This memo investigates the registry structure that best describes
   IPPM delay variation metrics based on [RFC3393] using the conventions
   of the IPPM framework [RFC2330].

   We find that the flexibility allowed in [RFC3393] requires further
   specificity to have a metric worthy of registration, and we refer to
   [RFC5481] for the needed definition details.

   In this memo, we attempt a combinatoric registry, where all factors



Morton                  Expires February 27, 2014               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               Round-trip Loss                 August 2013


   that can be reasonably specified ARE specified, and changing even one
   factor would require a new registry entry (row).  It is believed that
   this exercise can also be instructive for a registry based on
   independent factors, [draft-bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent]
   but that topic is beyond the scope of this effort.


3.  List of Registry Columns

   This section briefly describes the columns used by this draft, as
   this is likely to be a topic for discussion and revision.  Taken as a
   whole, the entries in the columns give a registered instance of a
   metric with sufficient specificity to promote comparable results
   across independent implementations.  In other words, a complete
   Metric Description.

3.1.  Element ID

   An integer having enough digits to uniquely identify each entry in
   the Registry.

3.2.  Metric Name

   A metric naming convention is TBD.

   The current guidance from Section 13 of [RFC2330], where Type-P is a
   feature of all IPPM metric names, is:

   "... we introduce the generic notion of a "packet of type P", where
   in some contexts P will be explicitly defined (i.e., exactly what
   type of packet we mean), partially defined (e.g., "with a payload of
   B octets"), or left generic.  Thus we may talk about generic IP-type-
   P-connectivity or more specific IP-port-HTTP-connectivity.  Some
   metrics and methodologies may be fruitfully defined using generic
   type P definitions which are then made specific when performing
   actual measurements.  Whenever a metric's value depends on the type
   of the packets involved in the metric, the metric's name will include
   either a specific type or a phrase such as "type-P". ..."

   Registry entries are a context where Type-P must be defined.

   IPPM Metric names have also included the typically included the
   stream type, to distinguish between singleton and sample metrics (see
   [RFC2330] for the definition of these terms).

3.3.  Run-time Parameters

   Run-Time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.  However, the values of these
   parameters is not specified in the Registry, rather these parameters
   are listed as an aid to the measurement system implementor or user
   (they must be left as variables, and supplied on execution).

   Where metrics supply a list of Parameters as part of their
   descriptive template, a sub-set of the Parameters will be designated
   as Run-Time Parameters.

3.4.  Fixed Parameters

   Fixed Parameters are input factors that must be determined and
   embedded in the measurement system for use when needed.  The values
   of these parameters is specified in the Registry.

   Where metrics supply a list of Parameters as part of their
   descriptive template, a sub-set of the Parameters will be designated
   as Fixed Parameters.

   A Parameter which is Fixed for one Registry element may be designated
   as a Run-time Parameter for another Registry element.

3.5.  Metric Definition

   This entry provides references to relevant sections of the RFC(s)
   defining the metric, as well as any supplemental information needed
   to ensure an unambiguous definition for implementations.

3.6.  Metric Units (and Data Format?)

   The results of a metric must be expressed using some standard
   dimension or units of measure.  This column provides the units (and
   if possible, the data format, whose specification will simplify both
   measurement implementation and collection/storage tasks).

   When a sample of singletons is collected, this entry will include the
   data format and units of measure for each measured value.

3.7.  Stream Type and Stream Parameters

   Principally, two different streams are used in IPPM metrics, Poisson
   distributed as described in [RFC2330] and Periodic as described in
   [RFC3432].  Both Poisson and Periodic have their own unique
   parameters, and the relevant set is specified in as Fixed Parameters

   in this column.

3.8.  Method of Measurement

   This entry provides references to relevant sections of the RFC(s)
   describing the method of measurement, as well as any supplemental
   information needed to ensure an unambiguous methods for
   implementations.

3.9.  Output Statistic

   For entries which involve a stream and many singleton measurements, a
   statistic may be specified in this column to summarize the results to
   a single value.

3.10.  Discussion/Remarks

   Besides providing additional details which do not appear in other
   columns, the Discussion/Remarks column allows for unforeseen issues
   to be addressed by simply updating this Informational column.


4.  Registry Column Entries for PDV

   This is a complete Metric Description for one Packet Delay Variation
   (PDV) metric.

4.1.  Element ID

   An integer with enough digits to uniquely identify the entry.

4.2.  Metric Name

   A metric naming convention is TBD.

   One possibility based on IPPM's framework is:

   IP-UDP-One-way-pdv-95th-percentile-Poisson

4.3.  Run-time Parameters

   Where metrics supply a list of Parameters as part of their
   descriptive template, a sub-set of the Parameters will be designated
   as Run-Time Parameters.

   o  Src, the IP address of a host

Internet-Draft               Round-trip Loss                 August 2013


   o  Dst, the IP address of a host

   o  T, a time (start of test interval)

   o  Tf, a time (end of test interval)

   o  T1, the wire time of the first packet in a pair, measured at
      MP(Src) as it leaves for Dst.

   o  T2, the wire time of the second packet in a pair, measured at
      MP(Src) as it leaves for Dst.

   o  I(i),I(i+1), i >=0, pairs of times which mark the beginning and
      ending of the intervals in which the packet stream from which the
      measurement is taken occurs.  Here, I(0) = T0 and assuming that n
      is the largest index, I(n) = Tf.

4.4.  Fixed Parameters

   Where metrics supply a list of Parameters as part of their
   descriptive template, a sub-set of the Parameters will be designated
   as Fixed Parameters.

   o  F, a selection function defining unambiguously the packets from
      the stream selected for the metric.  See section 4.2 of [RFC5481]
      for the PDV form.

   o  L, a packet length in bits.  L = 200 bits.

   o  Tmax, a maximum waiting time for packets to arrive at Dst, set
      sufficiently long to disambiguate packets with long delays from
      packets that are discarded (lost).  Tmax = 3 seconds.

   o  Type-P, as defined in [RFC2330], which includes any field that may
      affect a packet's treatment as it traverses the network.  The
      packets are IP/UDP, with DSCP = 0 (BE).

4.5.  Metric Definition

   See sections 2.4 and 3.4 of [RFC3393].  Singleton delay differences
   measured are referred to by the variable name "ddT".

4.6.  Metric Units (and Data Format?)

   See section 3.3 of [RFC3393] for singleton elements.

   [RFC2330] recommends that when a time is given, it will be expressed
   in UTC.

   The timestamp format (for T, Tf, etc.) is the same as in [RFC5905]
   (64 bits) and is as follows: the first 32 bits represent the unsigned
   integer number of seconds elapsed since 0h on 1 January 1900; the
   next 32 bits represent the fractional part of a second that has
   elapsed since then.

   The result format for ddT is *similar to* the short format in
   [RFC5905] (32 bits) and is as follows: the first 16 bits represent
   the *signed* integer number of seconds; the next 16 bits represent
   the fractional part of a second.

4.7.  Stream Type and Stream Parameters

   Poisson distributed as described in [RFC2330], with the following
   Parameters.

   o  lambda, a rate in reciprocal seconds (for Poisson Streams). lambda
      = 1 packet per second

   o  Upper limit on Poisson distribution (values above this limit will
      be clipped and set to the limit value).  Upper limit = 30 seconds.

4.8.  Method of Measurement

   See section 2.6 and 3.6 of [RFC3393] for singleton elements.

4.9.  Output Statistic

   See section 4.3 of [RFC3393] for details on the percentile statistic.
   The percentile = 95.

   Individual results (singletons) should be represented by the
   following triple

   o  T1 and T2, times as described above

   o  ddT as defined in section 2.4 of [RFC3393]

   if needed.

4.10.  Discussion/Remarks

   Lost packets represent a challenge for delay variation metrics.  See
   section 4.1 of [RFC3393] and the delay variation applicability
   statement[RFC5481] for extensive analysis and comparison of PDV and
   IPDV.

      for a sample (Tf may be relative to T0 if desired).

   o  T1, the wire time of the first packet in a pair, measured at
      MP(Src) as it leaves for Dst.

   o  T2, the wire time of the second packet in a pair, measured at
      MP(Src) as it leaves for Dst.

   o  I(i),I(i+1), i >=0, pairs of times which mark the beginning and

      affect a packet's treatment as it traverses the network.  The
      packets are IP/UDP, with DSCP = 0 (BE).

5.5.  Metric Definition

   statistic, or max(ddT) - min(ddT).  Note that min(ddT) will almost
   always be a negative value.

   Individual results (singletons) should be represented by the
   following triple

   o  T1 and T2, times as described above

   o  ddT as defined in section 2.4 of [RFC3393]

   if needed.

5.10.  Discussion/Remarks

   Lost packets represent a challenge for delay variation metrics.  See
   section 4.1 of [RFC3393] and the delay variation applicability
   statement[RFC5481] for extensive analysis and comparison of PDV and
   IPDV.


6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Denial of Service Attacks

   The metrics in this memo require a stream of packets sent from one
   host (source) to another host (destination) through intervening
   networks, and back.  This method could be abused for denial of
   service attacks directed at the destination and/or the intervening
   network(s).

   Administrators of source, destination, and the intervening network(s)
   should establish bilateral or multi-lateral agreements regarding the
   timing, size, and frequency of collection of sample metrics.  Use of
   this method in excess of the terms agreed between the participants

   may be cause for immediate rejection or discard of packets or other
   escalation procedures defined between the affected parties.

6.2.  User Data Confidentiality

   Active use of this method generates packets for a sample, rather than
   taking samples based on user data, and does not threaten user data
   confidentiality.

6.3.  Interference with the metrics

   It may be possible to identify that a certain packet or stream of
   packets is part of a sample.  With that knowledge at the destination
   and/or the intervening networks, it is possible to change the
   processing of the packets (e.g. increasing or decreasing delay) in a
   way that may distort the measured performance.  It may also be
   possible to generate additional packets that appear to be part of the
   sample metric.  These additional packets are likely to perturb the
   results of the sample measurement.

   Authentication or encryption techniques, such as digital signatures,
   MAY be used where appropriate to guard against injected traffic
   attacks.  [RFC5357] includes both authentication and encryption
   features.


7.  IANA Considerations

   Metrics previously defined in IETF were registered in the IANA IPPM
   METRICS REGISTRY, however this process was discontinued when the
   registry structure was found to be inadequate, and the registry was
   declared Obsolete [RFC6248].

   Although the metrics in this draft may be considered for some form of
   registration in the future, no IANA Action is requested at this time.


8.  Acknowledgements

   The author thanks Brian Trammell for suggesting the term "Run-time
   Parameters", which led to the distinction between run-time and fixed
   parameters implemented in this memo.
