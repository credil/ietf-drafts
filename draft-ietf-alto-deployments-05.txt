                     ALTO Deployment Considerations
                     draft-ietf-alto-deployments-05

Abstract

   Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as
   pieces of information or server processes, which are available in
   several equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but
   is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal
   of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
   guidance to these applications, which have to select one or several
   hosts from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired
   resource.  The protocol is under specification in the ALTO working
   group.  This memo discusses deployment related issues of ALTO for
   peer-to-peer and CDNs, some preliminary security considerations, and
   also initial guidance for application designers using ALTO.

Internet-Draft          Deployment Considerations           October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as
   pieces of information or server processes, which are available in
   several equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but
   is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications and Content
   Delivery Networks (CDNs).  The goal of Application-Layer Traffic
   Optimization (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications, which
   have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates, that
   are able to provide a desired resource.  The basic ideas of ALTO are
   described in the problem space of ALTO is described in [RFC5693] and
   the set of requirements is discussed in [RFC6708].

   However, there are no considerations about what operational issues
   are to be expected once ALTO will be deployed.  This includes, but is
   not limited to, location of the ALTO server, imposed load to the ALTO
   server, or from whom the queries are performed.

   Comments and discussions about this memo should be directed to the
   ALTO working group: alto@ietf.org.

2.  General Considerations

   The ALTO protocol is a client/server protocol, operating between a
   number of ALTO clients and an ALTO server, as sketched in Figure 1.
   The ALTO working groups defines the ALTO protocol
   [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol].

2.1.  General Placement of ALTO

   The ALTO server and ALTO clients can be situated at various entities
   in a network deployment.  The first differentiation is whether the
   ALTO client is located on the actual host that runs the application,
   as shown in Figure 2, (e.g., peer-to-peer filesharing application) or
   if the ALTO client is located on resource directory, as shown in
   Figure 3 (e.g., a tracker in peer-to-peer filesharing).

   Figure 2 shows the operational model for applications that do not use
   a tracker, such as, edonky, or in if the tracker should be the
   querying party.  This use case also holds true for CDNs.  The ALTO
   server can also be queried by CDNs to get a guidance about where the
   a particular client accessing data in the CDN is exactly located in
   the ISP's network.

     Figure 3: Overview of protocol interaction between ALTO elements,
                           scenario with tracker

   However, Figure 3 does not denote where the ALTO elements are
   actually located, i.e., if the tracker and the ALTO server are in the
   same ISP's domain, or if the tracker and the ALTO server are managed/
   owned/located in different domains.  The latter is the typical use
   case, e.g., taking Pirate Bay as example that serves Bittorrent peers
   world-wide.

2.2.  Relationship between ALTO and Applications

   ALTO is intended to be used by a wide-range of applications.
   However, any application using ALTO must also work if no ALTO servers
   can be found or if no responses to ALTO queries are received, e.g.,
   due to connectivity problems or overload situation (see also
   [RFC6708]).  (Editor's note: better text needed here!)

2.3.  Provided Guidance

   ALTO gives guidance to applications on what IP addresses or IP
   prefixes, and such which hosts are to be preferred according to the
   operator of the ALTO server.  The general assumption of the ALTO WG
   is that a network operator would always express to prefer hosts in
   its own network while hosts located outside its own network are to be
   avoided (are undesired to be considered by the applications).  This
   might be applicable in some cases but may not be applicable in the
   general case.  The ALTO protocol gives only the means to let the ALTO
   server operator to express is preference, whatever this preference

   is.  This section explores this space.

2.3.1.  Keeping Traffic Local in Network

   ALTO guidance can be used to let applications prefer other peers
   within the same network operator's network instead of randomly
   connecting to other peers which are located in another operator's
   network.  Figure 4 shows such a scenario where peers prefer peers in
   the same network (e.g., Peer 1 and Peer 2 in ISP1 and Peer 3 and Peer
   4 in ISP2).

                Figure 4: ALTO Traffic Network Localization

   TBD: Describes limits of this approach (e.g., traffic localization
   guidance is of less use if the peers cannot upload); describe how
   maps would look like.

2.3.2.  Off-Loading Traffic from Network

   Another scenario where the use of ALTO can be beneficial is in mobile
   broadband networks, e.g., CDMA200 or UMTS, but where the network
   operator may have the desire to guide peers in its own network to use
   peers in remote networks.  One reason can be that the wireless
   network is not made for the load cause by, e.g., peer-to-peer

   applications, and the operator has the need that peers fetch their
   data from remote peers in other parts of the Internet.

2.3.3.  Intra-Network Localization/Bottleneck Off-Loading

   The above sections described the results of the ALTO guidance on an
   inter-network level.  However, ALTO can also be used to guide peers
   on which internal peers are to be preferred.  For instance, to guide
   Peers on a remote network side to prefer to connect to each other,
   instead of crossing a bottleneck link, a backhaul link to connect the
   side to the network core.  Figure 6 shows such a scenario where Peer
   1 and Peer 2 are located in Net 2 of ISP1 and connect via a low
   capacity link to the core (Net 1) of the same ISP1.  Peer1 and Peer 2
   would both exchange their data with remote peers, probably clogging
   the bottleneck link.

3.  Deployment Considerations by ISPs

   The Internet is a large network constituted of multiple networks
   worldwide.  Numerous of these networks are built by telecom operators
   or network operators (named ISP in this memo), and these networks
   provide network connectivity, such as cable networks, 3G and so on.
   As well as some of networks are built by universities or big
   organizations themselves, and these networks are used to provide
   connectivity for research and work.  The essence of Internet is its
   connectivity and sharing capability.  However, ISPs emphasize
   network's manageability and controllability, because ISPs provide
   public network access service for most person and families, they need
   to manage, to control and to audit the traffic.  Thus, it's important
   for ISPs to understand the requirement of optimizing traffic, and how
   to deploy ALTO service in these manageability and controllability
   networks.

3.1.  Requirement for Traffic Optimization by ISPs

   All networks of ISPs are connected to each other through peering
   points.  From view of business mode, the inter-network settlement is
   needed in traffic exchanging between these ISP's networks.  The
   current settlement can be costly.  So to save these cost, the simple
   and basic method is to decrease the traffic exchange across the
   peering points and keep the traffic in own network area.

   For some large ISPs, their whole network is layered.  The upper layer
   network includes one or several backbone networks, and the lower
   layer network includes multiple access networks.  These access
   networks are connected to backbone networks, and the exchange traffic
   with others through backbone network.  In this kind of layered
   network, the bandwidth of backbone network is important and may be
   scarce.  Traffic should be limited to the access networks, so to
   decrease the usage of backbone as far as possible.

   Compared to fixed networks, mobile networks have some special
   characters, including small link bandwidth, high cost, limited radio
   frequency resource, and terminal battery.  In mobile network, the
   usage of wireless link should be decreased as far as possible and be
   high-efficient.  For example, in the case of a P2P service, the
   clients in the fixed network should decrease the data transport from
   the clients in the mobile networks, as well as the clients in the
   mobile networks should prefer the data transmission from the clients
   in the fixed networks.

3.2.  Considerations for ISPs

3.2.1.  Very small ISPs with simple Network Structure

   For very small ISPs, the traffic optimizing problem they focus is
   that how to decrease the traffic exchanging with other ISPs, because
   of high settlement costs.  To use the ALTO service to optimize
   traffic, small ISPs can define two optimization areas: one is their
   own network; the other is all outer networks connected with their
   network.  The cost map can be defined like this: the cost of link
   between clients of inner ISP's networks is lower than from clients of
   outer ISP's networks to clients of inner ISP's networks.  So the
   client of this ISP will prefer to require data from the clients in
   the same ISP with high priority.

   One example is given as below in Figure 8.  ISP A is one small ISP,
   only having one access network.  In ALTO service deploying, we can
   define ISP A to be one optimization area, named as PID1, and define
   other networks to be the other optimization area, named as PID2.  C1
   is denoted as the link cost in inner ISP A. C2 is denoted as the link
   cost from PID2 to PID1.  We define the cost map as:

   C1<C2

              -----------
          ////           \\\\
        //                   \\
      //                       \\                  /-----------\
     | +---------+               |             ////             \\\\
     | | ALTO    |  ISP A        |    C2      |    Other Networks   |
    |  | Service |  PID 1         <-----------     PID 2
     | +---------+  C1           |            |                     |
     |                           |             \\\\             ////
      \\                       //                  \-----------/
        \\                   //
          \\\\           ////
              -----------

3.2.2.  Large ISPs with layered fixed Network Structure

   For large ISPs with layered fixed network structure, the traffic
   optimizing problems they focus will include that: using backbone
   network by high-efficiency, adjusting traffic balance in different
   access networks according to traffic conditions and management
   policies, and considering settlement cost with other ISPs.  So in

Internet-Draft          Deployment Considerations           October 2012


   ALTO service deploying to this kind of large ISP, first the
   optimization area can be defined according to real network condition.
   For example, each access network can be defined to be one
   optimization area.  Then cost can be defined according to the
   optimizing requirement by ISPs.  There is one example described below
   and also shown in Figure 9.

   In this example, ISP A has one backbone network and three access
   networks, named as AN A, AN B, and AN C. A P2P application is used in
   this example.  For the traffic optimization, the first requirement is
   to decrease the P2P traffic of backbone network in inner ISP A; and
   the second requirement is to decrease the P2P traffic to outer ISPs.
   Always, the second requirement is prior to the first one.  Also, we
   assume that the settlement rate with ISP B is lower than with other
   ISPs.  Then ISP A can deploy ALTO service to meet the need of traffic
   optimization.  We will give the detail example of ALTO service
   definition and configuration according to requirements above.

   In inner network of ISP A, we can define each access network to be
   one optimization area, and assign one PID to every access network,
   such as PID1, PID2, and PID 3.  Because of different settlement with
   different outer ISPs, we define ISP B to be one optimization area,
   and assign PID 4 to it, as well as define all other networks to be
   one optimization area and PID 5.

   We assign cost names (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7) as the figure
   below.  C1 is denoted as the link cost in inner AN A, the same as C2
   and C3.  C4 is denoted as the link cost from PID 1 to PID 2, the same
   as C5.  C6 is denoted as the link cost from the ISP B to ISP A. C7 is
   denoted as the link cost from other networks to ISP A.

   According to discussion of the first requirement and the second
   requirement above, the relationship of these costs will be defined
   as: (C1, C2, C3) < (C4, C5) < (C6) < (C7)

   This is one very simple example above, in which we do not consider
   the different link type of access network.  In deploying ALTO service
   in real network, we must consider more real network conditions and
   requirements.  One real example is described in greater detail in
   [I-D.lee-alto-chinatelecom-trial].

3.2.3.  ISPs with Mobile Network

   For ISPs with mobile network and fixed network, the traffic
   optimizing problems they focus will be optimizing the mobile traffic,
   except problems on last hop section.  Wireless radio frequency
   resource is scarce and costly in mobile network.  The requirement of
   traffic optimization in mobile network is mainly decreasing the usage
   of radio resource.  The ALTO service can be deployed to meet these
   needs.

   For example in one ISP A as below in Figure 10, there is one mobile
   network is connected to backbone network.  In this kind of network
   structure, mobile network can be defined as one optimization area,
   and assigned PID 1.  We also define other PID and cost as figure
   below.

   To decrease the usage of wireless link, the relationship of these
   costs will be defined to:

   From view of mobile network:(C4 < C1).  This means that, the clients
   in mobile network requiring data resource from clients of the other
   access networks is prior to clients of mobile network.  This policy
   can decrease the usage of wireless link and power consumption in
   terminal.

   From view of AN A:(C2 < C6, C5 = maximum cost).  This means that, to

   other optimization area, requiring data from mobile network should be
   avoided.

   server has to discover the handling ALTO server, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-alto-server-discovery].  However, the peers do not have any
   way to query the server themselves.  This setting allows to give the
   peers a better selection of candidate peers for their operation at an
   initial time, but does not consider peers learned through direct
   peer-to-peer knowledge exchange.  This is called peer exchange (PEX)
   in bittorent, for instance.

              Figure 12: Global Tracker - Local ALTO Servers

   The scenario in Figure 12 lets the peers directly communicate with
   their ISP's ALTO server (i.e., ALTO client embedded in the peers),
   giving thus the peers the most control on which information they
   query for, as they can integrate information received from trackers
   and through direct peer-to-peer knowledge exchange.

     Figure 13: P4P approach with local tracker and local ALTO server

   There are some attempts to let ISP's to deploy their own trackers, as
   shown in Figure 13.  In this case, the client has no chance to get
   guidance from the ALTO server, other than talking to the ISP's
   tracker.  However, the peers would have still chance the contact
   other trackers, deployed by entities other than the peer's ISP.

   Figure 13 and Figure 11 ostensibly take peers the possibility to
   directly query the ALTO server, if the communication with the ALTO
   server is not permitted for any reason.  However, considering the
   plethora of different applications of ALTO, e.g., multiple tracker
   and non-tracker based P2P systems and or applications searching for
   relays, it seems to be beneficial for all participants to let the
   peers directly query the ALTO server.  The peers are also the single
   point having all operational knowledge to decide whether to use the
   ALTO guidance and how to use the ALTO guidance.  This is a preference
   for the scenario depicted in Figure Figure 12.

4.1.  Using ALTO for Tracker-based Peer-to-Peer Applications

   The scope of this section is the interaction of peer-to-peer
   applications that use a centralized resource directory ("tracker"),
   with the ALTO service.  In this scenario, the resource consumer

   ("peer") asks the resource directory for a list of candidate resource
   providers, which can provide the desired resource.

   For efficiency reasons (i.e., message size), usually only a subset of
   all resource providers known to the resource directory will be
   returned to the resource consumer.  Some or all of these resource
   providers, plus further resource providers learned by other means
   such as direct communication between peers, will be contacted by the
   resource consumer for accessing the resource.  The purpose of ALTO is
   giving guidance on this peer selection, which is supposed to yield
   better-than-random results.  The tracker response as well as the ALTO
   guidance are most beneficial in the initial phase after the resource
   consumer has decided to access a resource, as long as only few
   resource providers are known.  Later, when the resource consumer has
   already exchanged some data with other peers and measured the
   transmission speed, the relative importance of ALTO may dwindle.

   The ALTO protocol specification [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] details how
   an ALTO client can query an ALTO server for guiding information and
   receive the corresponding replies.  However, in the considered
   scenario of a tracker-based P2P application, there are two
   fundamentally different possibilities where to place the ALTO client:

   1.  ALTO client in the resource consumer ("peer")

   2.  ALTO client in the resource directory ("tracker")

   In the following, both scenarios are compared in order to explain the
   need for third-party ALTO queries.

   In the first scenario (see Figure 15), the resource consumer queries
   the resource directory for the desired resource (F1).  The resource
   directory returns a list of potential resource providers without
   considering ALTO (F2).  It is then the duty of the resource consumer
   to invoke ALTO (F3/F4), in order to solicit guidance regarding this
   list.

   In the second scenario (see Figure 17), the resource directory has an
   embedded ALTO client, which we will refer to as RDAC in this
   document.  After receiving a query for a given resource (F1) the
   resource directory invokes the RDAC to evaluate all resource
   providers it knows (F2/F3).  Then it returns a, possibly shortened,
   list containing the "best" resource providers to the resource
   consumer (F4).

   Note: the message sequences depicted in Figure 15 and Figure 17 may
   occur both in the target-aware and the target-independent query mode
   (c.f.  [RFC6708]).  In the target-independent query mode no message
   exchange with the ALTO server might be needed after the tracker
   query, because the candidate resource providers could be evaluated
   using a locally cached "map", which has been retrieved from the ALTO
   server some time ago.

   The problem with the first approach is, that while the resource
   directory might know thousands of peers taking part in a swarm, the
   list returned to the resource consumer is usually shortened for
   efficiency reasons.  Therefore, the "best" (in the sense of ALTO)
   potential resource providers might not be contained in that list
   anymore, even before ALTO can consider them.

   For illustration, consider a simple model of a swarm, in which all
   peers fall into one of only two categories: assume that there are
   "good" ("good" in the sense of ALTO's better-than-random peer
   selection, based on an arbitrary desired rating criterion) and "bad'
   peers only.  Having more different categories makes the maths more
   complex but does not change anything to the basic outcome of this
   analysis. ssume that the swarm has a total number of N peers, out of
   which are M "good" and N-M "bad" peers, which are all known to the
   tracker.  A new peer wants to join the swarm and therefore asks the
   tracker for a list of peers.

   If, according to the first approach, the tracker randomly picks n
   peers from the N known peers, the result can be described with the
   hypergeometric distribution.  The probability that the tracker reply
   contains exactly k "good" peers (and n-k "bad" peers) is:



              / m \   / N - m \
              \ k /   \ n - k /
  P(X=k) =  ---------------------
                    / N \
                    \ n /


          / n \        n!
  with    \ k /  = -----------    and    n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * .. * 1
                    k! (n-k)!


   The probability that the reply contains at most k "good" peers is:
   P(X<=k)=P(X=0)+P(X=1)+..+P(X=k).

   For example, consider a swarm with N=10,000 peers known to the
   tracker, out of which M=100 are "good" peers.  If the tracker
   randomly selects n=100 peers, the formula yields for the reply:
   P(X=0)=36%, P(X<=4)=99%.  That is, with a probability of approx. 36%
   this list does not contain a single "good" peer, and with 99%
   probability there are only four or less of the "good" peers on the
   list.  Processing this list with the guiding ALTO information will
   ensure that the few favorable peers are ranked to the top of the



Stiemerling & Kiesel     Expires April 25, 2013                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft          Deployment Considerations           October 2012


   list; however, the benefit is rather limited as the number of
   favorable peers in the list is just too small.

   Much better traffic optimization could be achieved if the tracker
   would evaluate all known peers using ALTO, and return a list of 100
   peers afterwards.  This list would then include a significantly
   higher fraction of "good" peers.  (Note, that if the tracker returned
   "good" peers only, there might be a risk that the swarm might
   disconnect and split into several disjunct partitions.  However,
   finding the right mix of ALTO-biased and random peer selection is out
   of the scope of this document.)

   Therefore, from an overall optimization perspective, the second
   scenario with the ALTO client embedded in the resource directory is
   advantageous, because it is ensured that the addresses of the "best"
   resource providers are actually delivered to the resource consumer.
   An architectural implication of this insight is that the ALTO server
   discovery procedures must support third-party discovery.  That is, as
   the tracker issues ALTO queries on behalf of the peer which contacted
   the tracker, the tracker must be able to discover an ALTO server that
   can give guidance suitable for the that respective peer.

4.2.  Expectations of ALTO

   This section hints to some recent experiments conducted with ALTO-
   like deployments in Internet Service Provider (ISP) network's.  NTT
   performed tests with their HINT server implementation and dummy nodes
   to gain insight on how an ALTO-like service influence a peer-to-peer
   systems [I-D.kamei-p2p-experiments-japan].  The results of an early
   experiment conducted in the Comcast network are documented
   here[RFC5632]

5.  Using ALTO for CDNs

   Section 2 discussed the placement and usage of ALTO for P2P systems,
   but not beyond.  This section discuss the usage of ALTO for Content
   Delivery Networks (CDNs).  CDNs are used to bring a service (e.g., a
   web page, videos, etc) closer to the location of the user - where
   close refers to shorten the distance between the client and the
   server in the IP topology.  CDNs use several techniques to decide
   which server is closest to a client requesting a service.  One common
   way to do so, is relying on the DNS system, but there are many other
   ways, see [RFC3568].

   The general issue for CDNs, independent of DNS or HTTP Redirect based
   approaches (see, for instance, [I-D.penno-alto-cdn]), is that the CDN
   logic has to match the client's IP address with the closest CDN
   cache.  This matching is not trivial, for instance, in DNS based
   approaches, where the IP address of the DNS original requester is
   unknown (see [I-D.vandergaast-edns-client-ip] for a discussion of
   this and a solution approach).

5.1.  Request Routing using the Endpoint Cost Service

   Alternatively, the Request Router may request the Endpoint service
   from the ALTO client.

   Specifically, the Request Router requests the Endpoint Cost Service
   in order to rank/rate the content locations (i.e., IP addresses of
   CDN nodes) based on their distance/cost (by default the Endpoint Cost
   Service operates based on Routing Distance) from/to the user address.

   Once the Request Router obtained from the ALTO Server the ranked list
   of locations (for the specific user) it can incorporate this
   information into its selection mechanisms in order to point the user
   to the most appropriate location.

   A Request Router that uses the Endpoint Cost Service may query the
   ALTO Server for rankings of CDN Node IP addresses for each
   interesting host and cache the results for later usage.

   Maps Services and ECS deliver similar ALTO service by allowing the
   CDN to optimize internal selection mechanisms.  Both services deliver
   similar level of security, confidentiality of layer-specific
   information (i.e.: application and network) however, Maps and ECS
   differ in the way the ALTO service is delivered and address a
   different set of requirements in terms of topology information and
   network operations.

Internet-Draft          Deployment Considerations           October 2012


5.1.1.  ALTO Topology Vs. Network Topology

   The ALTO server builds a ALTO-specific network topology that
   represents the network as it should be understood and utilized by the
   application layer (the CDN).  Besides the security requirements that
   consist of not delivering any confidential or critical information
   about the infrastructure, there are efficiency requirements in terms
   of what visibility of the network, and which level of granularity, it
   is required by the CDN and more in general by the application layer.

   The ALTO server builds topology (for either Map and ECS services)
   based on multiple sources that may include: routing protocols,
   network policies, state and performance information, geo-location,
   etc.  In all cases, the ALTO topology will not contain any details
   that would endanger the network integrity and security (e.g.: There
   will be no leaking of OSPF/ISIS/BGP databases to ALTO clients).

5.1.2.  Topology Computation and ECS Delivery

   ECS allows the CDN not to have to implement any specific algorithm or
   mechanism in order to retrieve, maintain and process network topology
   information (of any kind).  The complexity of the network topology
   (computation, maintenance and distribution) is kept in the ALTO
   server and ECS is delivered on demand.  Thus ECS is used in order to
   implement a lightweight integration of ALTO services in the CDN
   layer.  ECS implies an ALTO and CDN implementation with the necessary
   scalability in order to cope with the amount of transactions that CDN
   and ALTO server will have to handle (knowing that the CDN is able to
   cache ALTO ECS results for further use).

   The ALTO server delivering ECS may integrate various information
   sources such as routing topology, policies, state and performance,
   geo-location, etc, and deliver the ranking service to the CDN upon
   request.  The network topology information is controlled, managed by
   the ALTO server and the CDN benefits from ranking services in order
   to optimize application layer mechanisms used for content location
   selection.  This allows the ALTO server to enhance and modify the way
   the topology information sources are used and combined without
   requiring any update in the mechanisms the ECS is delivered and do
   not require any update process between ALTO and the CDN.

5.1.3.  Ranking Service

   When a user request a given content, the CDN locates the content in
   one or more caches and executes a selection algorithms in order to
   redirect the user to the 'best' cache.  In order to achieve that, the
   CDN issues an ECS request with the endpoint address (IPv4/IPv6) of
   the user (content requester) and the set of endpoint addresses of the



Stiemerling & Kiesel     Expires April 25, 2013                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft          Deployment Considerations           October 2012


   content caches (content targets).  The ALTO server, receives the
   request and ranks the list of content targets addresses based on
   their distance from the content requester.  By default, according to
   [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol], the distance represents the routing cost as
   computed by the routing layer (OSPF, ISIS, BGP) and may take into
   consideration other routing criteria such as MPLS-VPN (MP-BGP) and
   MPLS-TE (RSVP), policy and state and performance information in
   addition to other information sources (policy, geo-location, state
   and performance).

   Once the ALTO server computed the distance it replies with the ranked
   list of content target addresses.  The list being ranked by distance,
   the CDN is capable of integrating the rankings into its selection
   process (that will also incorporate other criteria) and redirect the
   user accordingly.

5.1.4.  Ranking and Network Events

   ALTO server ranks addresses based on topology information it acquires
   from the network.  The different methods and algorithms through which
   the ALTO server computes topology information and rankings is out of
   the scope of this document.  However, and in the case the rankings
   are based on routing (IP/MPLS) topology, it is obvious that network
   events may impact the ranking computation.  The scope of the ECS
   service delivered to a CDN is not to maintain the CDN aware of any
   possible network topology changes since, due to redundancy of current
   networks, most of the network events happening in the infrastructure
   will have limited impact on the CDN.  However, catastrophic events
   such as main trunks failures or backbone partition will have to take
   into account by the ALTO server so to redirect traffic away from the
   failure impacted area.

5.1.5.  Caching and Lifetime

   Each reply sent back by the ALTO server to the ALTO client running in
   the CDN has a validity in time so that the CDN can cache the results
   in order to re-use it and hence reducing the number of transactions
   between CDN and ALTO server.  The ALTO server may indicate in the
   reply message how long the content of the message is to be considered
   reliable and insert a lifetime value that will be used by the CDN in
   order to cache (and then flush or refresh) the entry.

   An ALTO server implementation may want to keep state about ALTO
   clients so to inform and signal to these clients when a major network
   event happened so to clear the ALTO cache in the client.  In a CDN/
   ALTO interworking architecture where there's a few CDN component
   interacting with the ALTO server there are no scalability issues in
   maintaining state about clients in the ALTO server.

Internet-Draft          Deployment Considerations           October 2012


5.1.6.  Redirection

   When ALTO server receives an ECS request, it may not have the most
   appropriate topology information in order to accurately determine the
   ranking.  In such case, the ALTO server, may want to adopt the
   following strategies:

   o  Reply with available information (best effort).

   o  Redirect the request to another ALTO server presumed to have
      better topology information (redirection).

   o  Doing both (best effort and redirection).  In this case, the reply
      message contains both the rankings and the indication of another
      ALTO server where more accurate rankings may be delivered.

   The decision process that is used to determine if redirection is
   necessary (and which mode to use) is out of the scope of this
   document.  As an example, an ALTO server may decide to redirect any
   request having addresses that are located into a remote Autonomous
   System.  In such case the redirection message includes the ALTO
   server to be used and that resides in the remote AS.  Redirection
   implies communication between ALTO servers so to be able to signal
   their identity, location and type of visibility (AS number).

5.1.7.  Groups and Costs

   An automated ALTO implementation may use dynamic algorithms to
   aggregate network topology.  However, it is often desirable to have a
   mechanism through which the network operator can control the level
   and details of network aggregation based on a set of requirements and
   constraints.  IP/MPLS networks make use of a common mechanism to
   aggregate and group prefixes that is called BGP Communities.  BGP is
   the protocol all SP networks use in order to exchange information
   about their prefix reachability.  BGP Community us an attribute used
   to tag a prefix so to group prefixes based on mostly any criteria (as
   an example, most SP networks originate BGP prefixes with communities
   identifying the Point of Presence (PoP) where the prefix has been
   originated).

   The ALTO server may leverage the BGP information that is available in
   the SP network layer and compute group of prefixes.  By policy, the
   ALTO server operator may decide an arbitrary cost to set between
   groups.  Alternatively, there are algorithms that allows a dynamic
   computation of cost between groups.

6.  Advanced Features

6.1.  Cascading ALTO Servers

   The main assumptions of ALTO seems to be each ISP operates its own
   ALTO server independently, irrespectively of the ISP's situation.
   This may true for most envisioned deployments of ALTO but there are
   certain deployments that may have different settings.  Figure 18
   shows such setting, were for example, a university network is
   connected to two upstream providers.  ISP2 if the national research
   network and ISP1 is a commercial upstream provider to this university
   network.  The university, as well as ISP1, are operating their own
   ALTO server.  The ALTO clients, located on the peers will contact the
   ALTO server located at the university.

   In this setting all "destinations" useful for the peers within ISP2
   are free-of-charge for the peers located in the university network
   (i.e., they are preferred in the rating of the ALTO server).
   However, all traffic that is not towards ISP2 will be handled by the

   ISP1 upstream provider.  Therefore, the ALTO server at the university
   has also to include the guidance given by the ISP1 ALTO server in its
   replies to the ALTO clients.  This can be called cascaded ALTO
   servers.

6.2.  ALTO for IPv4 and IPv6

   TBD

6.3.  Monitoring ALTO

   In addition to providing configuration, an ISP providing ALTO may
   want to deploy a monitoring infrastructure to assess the benefits of
   ALTO and adjust its ALTO configuration according to the results of
   the monitoring.

   To construct an effective monitoring infrastructure, the ISP should
   (1) define the performance metrics to be monitored; (2) and identify
   and deploy data sources to collect data to compute the performance
   metrics.  We discuss both below.

   [Editor's note: Is there a relationship to the IPPM working group at
   the IETF?]

6.3.1.  Monitoring Metrics Definition

   o  Inter-domain ALTO-Integrated Application Traffic (Network metric):
      This metric includes total cross domain traffic generated by
      applications that utilize ALTO guidance.  This metric evaluates
      the impacts of ALTO on the inbound and outbound traffic of a
      domain.

   o  Total Inter-domain Traffic (Network metric): This is similar to
      the preceding but focuses on all of the traffic, ALTO aware or
      not.  One possibility is that some of the reduction of interdomain
      traffic by ALTO aware applications may (XXX missing words?).  This
      metric is always used with the preceding and the following
      metrics.

   o  Intra-domain ALTO-Integrated Application Traffic (Network metric).
      (XXX description missing)

   o  Network hop count (Network metric): This metric provides the
      average number of hops that traffic traverses inside a domain.
      ALTO may reduce not only traffic volume but also the hops.  The
      metric can also indirectly reflect some application performance
      (e.g., latency).

Internet-Draft          Deployment Considerations           October 2012


   o  Application download rate (Application metric): This metric
      measures application performance directly.  Download means inbound
      traffic to one user.  Global average means the average value of
      all users' download rates in one or more domains.

   o  Application Client type audit(Application metric): this metric
      gives the audit of client types in ALTO service.  The current
      types include fixed network client and mobile network client.

6.3.2.  Monitoring Data Sources

   The preceding metrics are derived from data sources.  We identify
   three data sources.

   1.  Application Log Server: Many application systems deploy Log
       Servers to collect data.

   2.  P2P Clients: Some P2P applications may not have Log Servers.
       When available, P2P client logs can provide data.  This is for
       P2P application

   3.  OAM: Many ISPs deploy OAM systems to monitor IP layer traffic.
       An OAM provides traffic monitoring of every network device in its
       management area.  It provides data such as link physical
       bandwidth and traffic volumes.

6.3.3.  Monitoring Structure

   As discussed in the preceding section, some data sources are from ISP
   while some others are from application.  When there is a
   collaboration agreement between the ISP and an application, there can
   be an integrated monitoring system as shown in the figure below.  In
   particular, an application developer may deploy Monitor Clients to
   communicate with Monitor Server of the ISP to transmit raw data from
   the Log Server or P2P clients of the application to the ISP.

7.  Known Limitations of ALTO

   This section describes some known limitations of ALTO in general or
   specific mechanisms in ALTO.

7.1.  Limitations of Map-based Approaches

   The specification of the ALTO protocol [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] uses,
   amongst others mechanism, so-called network maps.  The network map
   approach uses Host Group Descriptors that group one or multiple
   subnetworks (i.e., IP prefixes) to a single Host Group Descriptor.  A
   set of IP prefixes is called partition and the associated Host Group
   Descriptor is called partition ID.  The "costs" between the various
   partition IDs is stored in a second map, the cost map.  Map-based
   approaches are chosen as they lower the signaling load on the server,
   as the maps have only to be retrieved if they are changed.

   The main assumption for map-based approaches is that the information
   provided in these maps is static for a longer period of time, where
   this period of time refers to days, but not hours or even minutes.
   This assumption is fine, as long as the network operator does not
   change any parameter, e.g., routing within the network and to the
   upstream peers, IP address assignment stays stable (and thus the
   mapping to the partitions).  However, there are several cases where
   this assumption is not valid, as:

   1.  ISPs reallocate IPv4 subnets from time to time;

   2.  ISPs reallocate IPv4 subnets on short notice;

   3.  IP prefix blocks may be assigned to a single DSLAM which serves a
       variety of access networks.

   For 1): ISPs reallocate IPv4 subnets within their infrastructure from
   time to time, partly to ensure the efficient usage of IPv4 addresses
   (a scarce resource), and partly to enable efficient route tables
   within their network routers.  The frequency of these "renumbering
   events" depend on the growth in number of subscribers and the
   availability of address space within the ISP.  As a result, a
   subscriber's household device could retain an IPv4 address for as
   short as a few minutes, or for months at a time or even longer.

      Some folks have suggested that ISPs providing ALTO services could
      sub-divide their subscribers' devices into different IPv4 subnets
      (or certain IPv4 address ranges) based on the purchased service
      tier, as well as based on the location in the network topology.
      The problem is that this sub-allocation of IPv4 subnets tends to
      decrease the efficiency of IPv4 address allocation.  A growing ISP



Stiemerling & Kiesel     Expires April 25, 2013                [Page 33]

Internet-Draft          Deployment Considerations           October 2012


      that needs to maintain high efficiency of IPv4 address utilization
      may be reluctant to jeopardize their future acquisition of IPv4
      address space.

   However, this is not an issue for map-based approaches if changes are
   applied in the order of days.

   For 2): ISPs can use techniques, such as ODAP (XXX) that allow the
   reallocation of IP prefixes on very short notice, i.e., within
   minutes.  An IP prefix that has no IP address assignment to a host
   anymore can be reallocate to areas where there is currently a high
   demand for IP addresses.

   For 3): In DSL-based access networks, IP prefixes are assigned to
   DSLAMs which are the first IP-hop in the access-network between the
   CPE and the Internet.  The access-network between CPE and DSLAM
   (called aggregation network) can have varying characteristics (and
   thus associated costs), but still using the same IP prefix.  For
   instance one IP addresses IP11 out of a IP prefix IP1 can be assigned
   to a VDSL (e.g., 2 MBit/s uplink) access-line while the subsequent IP
   address IP12 is assigned to a slow ADSL line (e.g., 128 kbit/s
   uplink).  These IP addresses are assigned on a first come first
   served basis, i.e., the a single IP address out of the same IP prefix
   can change its associated costs quite fast.  This may not be an issue
   with respect to the used upstream provider (thus the cross ISP
   traffic) but depending on the capacity of the aggregation-network
   this may raise to an issue.

7.2.  Limitiations of Non-Map-based Approaches

   The specification of the ALTO protocol [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] uses,
   amongst others mechanism, a mechanism called Endpoint Cost Service.
   ALTO clients can ask guidance for specific IP addresses to the ALTO
   server.  However, asking for IP addresses, asking with long lists of
   IP addresses, and asking quite frequent may overload the ALTO server.
   The server has to rank each received IP address which causes load at
   the server.  This may be amplified by the fact that not only a single
   ALTO client is asking for guidance, but a larger number of them.

   Caching of IP addresses at the ALTO client or the usage of the H12
   approach [I-D.kiesel-alto-h12] in conjunction with caching may lower
   the query load on the ALTO server.

7.3.  General Challenges

   An ALTO server stores information about preferences (e.g., a list of
   preferred autonomous systems, IP ranges, etc) and ALTO clients can
   retrieve these preferences.  However, there are basically two



Stiemerling & Kiesel     Expires April 25, 2013                [Page 34]

Internet-Draft          Deployment Considerations           October 2012


   different approaches on where the preferences are actually processed:

   1.  The ALTO server has a list of preferences and clients can
       retrieve this list via the ALTO protocol.  This preference list
       can be partially updated by the server.  The actual processing of
       the data is done on the client and thus there is no data of the
       client's operation revealed to the ALTO server .

   2.  The ALTO server has a list of preferences or preferences
       calculated during runtime and the ALTO client is sending
       information of its operation (e.g., a list of IP addresses) to
       the server.  The server is using this operational information to
       determine its preferences and returns these preferences (e.g., a
       sorted list of the IP addresses) back to the ALTO client.

   Approach 1 (we call it H1) has the advantage (seen from the client)
   that all operational information stays within the client and is not
   revealed to the provider of the server.  On the other hand, does
   approach 1 require that the provider of the ALTO server, i.e., the
   network operator, reveals information about its network structure
   (e.g., AS numbers, IP ranges, topology information in general) to the
   ALTO client.

   Approach 2 (we call it H2) has the advantage (seen from the operator)
   that all operational information stays with the ALTO server and is
   not revealed to the ALTO client.  On the other hand, does approach 2
   require that the clients send their operational information to the
   server.

   Both approaches have their pros and cons and are extensively
   discussed on the ALTO mailing list.  But there is basically a
   dilemma: Approach 1 is seen as the only working solution by peer-to-
   peer software vendors and approach 2 is seen as the only working by
   the network operators.  But neither the software vendors nor the
   operators seem to willing to change their position.  However, there
   is the need to get both sides on board, to come to a solution.

8.  Extensions to the ALTO Protocol

8.1.  Host Group Descriptors

   Host group descriptors are used in the ALTO client protocol to
   describe the location of a host in the network topology.  The ALTO
   client protocol specification defines a basic set of host group
   descriptor types, which have to be supported by all implementations,
   and an extension procedure for adding new descriptor types .  The
   following list gives an overview on further host group descriptor
   types that have been proposed in the past, or which are in use by
   ALTO-related prototype implementations.  This list is not intended as
   normative text.  Instead, the only purpose of the following list is
   to document the descriptor types that have been proposed so far, and
   to solicit further feedback and discussion:

   o  Autonomous System (AS) number

   o  Protocol-specific group identifiers, which expand to a set of IP
      address ranges (CIDR) and/or AS numbers.  In one specific solution
      proposal, these are called Partition ID (PID).

8.2.  Rating Criteria

   Rating criteria are used in the ALTO client protocol to express
   topology- or connectivity-related properties, which are evaluated in
   order to generate the ALTO guidance.  The ALTO client protocol
   specification defines a basic set of rating criteria, which have to
   be supported by all implementations, and an extension procedure for
   adding new criteria .  The following list gives an overview on
   further rating criteria that have been proposed in the past, or which
   are in use by ALTO-related prototype implementations.  This list is
   not intended as normative text.  Instead, the only purpose of the
   following list is to document the rating criteria that have been
   proposed so far, and to solicit further feedback and discussion:

8.2.1.  Distance-related Rating Criteria

   o  Relative topological distance: relative means that a larger
      numerical value means greater distance, but it is up to the ALTO
      service how to compute the values, and the ALTO client will not be
      informed about the nature of the information.  One way of
      generating this kind of information MAY be counting AS hops, but
      when querying this parameter, the ALTO client MUST NOT assume that
      the numbers actually are AS hops.

   o  Absolute topological distance, expressed in the number of
      traversed autonomous systems (AS).

Internet-Draft          Deployment Considerations           October 2012


   o  Absolute topological distance, expressed in the number of router
      hops (i.e., how much the TTL value of an IP packet will be
      decreased during transit).

   o  Absolute physical distance, based on knowledge of the approximate
      geolocation (continent, country) of an IP address.

8.2.2.  Charging-related Rating Criteria

   o  Traffic volume caps, in case the Internet access of the resource
      consumer is not charged by "flat rate".  For each candidate
      resource provider, the ALTO service could indicate the amount of
      data that may be transferred from/to this resource provider until
      a given point in time, and how much of this amount has already
      been consumed.  Furthermore, it would have to be indicated how
      excess traffic would be handled (e.g., blocked, throttled, or
      charged separately at an indicated price).  The interaction of
      several applications running on a host, out of which some use this
      criterion while others don't, as well as the evaluation of this
      criterion in resource directories, which issue ALTO queries on
      behalf of other peers, are for further study.

8.2.3.  Performance-related Rating Criteria

   The following rating criteria are subject to the remarks below.

   o  The minimum achievable throughput between the resource consumer
      and the candidate resource provider, which is considered useful by
      the application (only in ALTO queries), or

   o  An arbitrary upper bound for the throughput from/to the candidate
      resource provider (only in ALTO responses).  This may be, but is
      not necessarily the provisioned access bandwidth of the candidate
      resource provider.

   o  The maximum round-trip time (RTT) between resource consumer and
      the candidate resource provider, which is acceptable for the
      application for useful communication with the candidate resource
      provider (only in ALTO queries), or

   o  An arbitrary lower bound for the RTT between resource consumer and
      the candidate resource provider (only in ALTO responses).  This
      may be, for example, based on measurements of the propagation
      delay in a completely unloaded network.

   The ALTO client MUST be aware, that with high probability, the actual
   performance values differ significantly from these upper and lower
   bounds.  In particular, an ALTO client MUST NOT consider the "upper

   bound for throughput" parameter as a permission to send data at the
   indicated rate without using congestion control mechanisms.

   The discrepancies are due to various reasons, including, but not
   limited to the facts that

   o  the ALTO service is not an admission control system

   o  the ALTO service may not know the instantaneous congestion status
      of the network

   o  the ALTO service may not know all link bandwidths, i.e., where the
      bottleneck really is, and there may be shared bottlenecks

   o  the ALTO service may not know whether the candidate peer itself is
      overloaded

   o  the ALTO service may not know whether the candidate peer throttles
      the bandwidth it devotes for the considered application

   o  the ALTO service may not know whether the candidate peer will
      throttle the data it sends to us (e.g., because of some fairness
      algorithm, such as tit-for-tat)

   Because of these inaccuracies and the lack of complete, instantaneous
   state information, which are inherent to the ALTO service, the
   application must use other mechanisms (such as passive measurements
   on actual data transmissions) to assess the currently achievable
   throughput, and it MUST use appropriate congestion control mechanisms
   in order to avoid a congestion collapse.  Nevertheless, these rating
   criteria may provide a useful shortcut for quickly excluding
   candidate resource providers from such probing, if it is known in
   advance that connectivity is in any case worse than what is
   considered the minimum useful value by the respective application.

8.2.4.  Inappropriate Rating Criteria

   Rating criteria that SHOULD NOT be defined for and used by the ALTO
   service include:

   o  Performance metrics that are closely related to the instantaneous
      congestion status.  The definition of alternate approaches for
      congestion control is explicitly out of the scope of ALTO.
      Instead, other appropriate means, such as using TCP based
      transport, have to be used to avoid congestion.

   This sections gives some informational guidance on how the interface
   between the actual application using the ALTO guidance and the ALTO
   client can look like.

   This is still TBD.

10.  Security Considerations

   The ALTO protocol itself, as well as, the ALTO client and server
   raise new security issues beyond the one mentioned in
   [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] and issues related to message transport over
   the Internet.  For instance, Denial of Service (DoS) is of interest
   for the ALTO server and also for the ALTO client.  A server can get
   overloaded if too many TCP requests hit the server, or if the query
   load of the server surpasses the maximum computing capacity.  An ALTO
   client can get overloaded if the responses from the sever are, either
   intentionally or due to an implementation mistake, too large to be
   handled by that particular client.

10.1.  Information Leakage from the ALTO Server

   The ALTO server will be provisioned with information about the owning
   ISP's network and very likely also with information about neighboring
   ISPs.  This information (e.g., network topology, business relations,
   etc) is consider to be confidential to the ISP and must not be
   revealed.

   The ALTO server will naturally reveal parts of that information in
   small doses to peers, as the guidance given will depend on the above
   mentioned information.  This is seen beneficial for both parties,
   i.e., the ISP's and the peer's.  However, there is the chance that
   one or multiple peers are querying an ALTO server with the goal to
   gather information about network topology or any other data
   considered confidential or at least sensitive.  It is unclear whether
   this is a real technical security risk or whether this is more a
   perceived security risk.

10.2.  ALTO Server Access

   Depending on the use case of ALTO, several access restrictions to an
   ALTO server may or may not apply.  For an ALTO server that is solely
   accessible by peers from the ISP network (as shown in Figure 12), for
   instance, the source IP address can be used to grant only access from
   that ISP network to the server.  This will "limit" the number of
   peers able to attack the server to the user's of the ISP (however,
   including botnet computers).

   On the other hand, if the ALTO server has to be accessible by parties
   not located in the ISP's network (see Figure Figure 11), e.g., by a
   third-party tracker or by a CDN system outside the ISP's network, the
   access restrictions have to be more loose.  In the extreme case,
   i.e., no access restrictions, each and every host in the Internet can
   access the ALTO server.  This might no the intention of the ISP, as
   the server is not only subject to more possible attacks, but also on

Internet-Draft          Deployment Considerations           October 2012


   the load imposed to the server, i.e., possibly more ALTO clients to
   serve and thus more work load.

10.3.  Faking ALTO Guidance

   It has not yet been investigated how a faked or wrong ALTO guidance
   by an ALTO server can impact the operation of the network and also
   the peers.

   Here is a list of examples how the ALTO guidance could be faked and
   what possible consequences may arise:

   Sorting  An attacker could change to sorting order of the ALTO
      guidance (given that the order is of importance, otherwise the
      ranking mechanism is of interest), i.e., declaring peers located
      outside the ISP as peers to be preferred.  This will not pose a
      big risk to the network or peers, as it would mimic the "regular"
      peer operation without traffic localization, apart from the
      communication/processing overhead for ALTO.  However, it could
      mean that ALTO is reaching the opposite goal of shuffling more
      data across ISP boundaries, incurring more costs for the ISP.

   Preference of a single peer  A single IP address (thus a peer) could
      be marked as to be preferred all over other peers.  This peer can
      be located within the local ISP or also in other parts of the
      Internet (e.g., a web server).  This could lead to the case that
      quite a number of peers to trying to contact this IP address,
      possibly causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

   This section is solely giving a first shot on security issues related
   to ALTO deployments.

11.  Conclusion

   This is the first version of the deployment considerations and for
   sure the considerations are yet incomplete and imprecise.
