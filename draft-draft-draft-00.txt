                          draft-draft-draft-00

Abstract

   Network file access is often highly inefficient due to complexity of
   existing protocols.  Direct Random Access File Transfer (DRAFT) is
   one new protocol that uses simple UDP techniques to overcome this
   problem.

1.  Introduction and Problem Statement

   Network file access is often very inefficient.  This is because
   available solutions are horribly complicated (e.g.  Network File
   System version 4).  A much simpler solution is needed.  It is called
   the Direct Random Access File Transfer (DRAFT).

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Protocol

   New file is opened by sending one UDP packet containing file name to
   agreed mutualy port number on an server.  Any IANA-defined port
   number will do, although for best results port 9 SHOULD NOT be used.

   One file block is written by sending an UDP packet to remote server
   at its port number corresponding to required file block.  Since port
   numbers up to 65535 are reserved by IANA, DRAFT port number is file
   block number plus 65536.  Contents of UDP payload is written to file
   block.  Server sends back 1 empty UDP packet if success.

   Any file block is read by sending one empty UDP packet to DRAFT port
   number as defined above.  Then server sends back one UDP packet
   containing file block.  No packet means no block success.

   Files are closed in the DRAFT when server crashes.  If client wants
   to open an additional file acheives so by picking different a source
   port.

   UDP checksums are inefficient so not used in the DRAFT.  The Internet
   is quite reliable enough without them.

   Also DRAFT does not make congestion control, because that would
   reduce performance just to be fair to other users.  Obviously that
   would be silly.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security is inefficient, so DRAFT provides none.  Most Internet users
   are quite honest.

5.  IANA Considerations

   It would be better if IANA would let us use all ports below 65536,
   but we are not optimistic.  IANA is very unhelpful about such
   requests.

6.  Acknowledgements

   There is no acknowledgements.  Nobody would help us.
