  Applicability of Proxy Mobile IPv6 Protocol for WLAN Access Networks
        draft-gundavelli-netext-pmipv6-wlan-applicability-04.txt

Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility management protocol.
   The protocol is designed for providing mobility management support to
   a mobile node, without requiring its participation in any IP mobility
   related signaling.  The base protocol is defined in an access
   technology independent manner, it identifies the general requirements
   from the link-layer for supporting the protocol operation.  However,
   it does not provide any specific details on how it can be supported
   on a specific access technology.  This specification identifies the
   key considerations for supporting Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol on the
   widely deployed wireless LAN access architectures, based on IEEE
   802.11 standards.  It explores the current dominant wireless LAN
   deployment models and provides the needed interworking details.

Internet-Draft     Proxy Mobile IPv6 for WLAN Networks      October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility management protocol
   specified in [RFC5213].  The protocol can be used for providing
   mobility management support to a mobile node within a localized
   domain, without requiring its participation in any IP mobility
   related signaling.

   The core functional entities in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain are the
   local mobility anchor (LMA) and the mobile access gateway (MAG).  The
   local mobility anchor is responsible for maintaining the mobile
   node's reachability state and is the topological anchor point for the
   mobile node's home network.  The mobile access gateway is the entity
   that performs the mobility management on behalf of a mobile node, and
   it resides on the access link where the mobile node is anchored.  The
   mobile access gateway is responsible for detecting the mobile node's
   movements to and from the access link and for initiating binding
   registrations to the mobile node's local mobility anchor.

   There are numerous protocol extensions defined to Proxy Mobile IPv6
   protocol, for supporting various features.  These features include
   support for IPv4 transport and addressing support [RFC5844], GRE Key
   negotiation support [RFC5845], Binding Revocation support [RFC5846].
   Diameter support [RFC5779], RADIUS support
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netext-radius-pmip6] and Proxy Mobile IPv6 MIB
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netlmm-pmipv6-mib].  All of these features give the
   protocol a completeness for being adopted as a network-based mobility
   management protocol within a micro-mobility domains, based on WLAN
   access architectures.

   This specification identifies the key considerations for supporting
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol in micro-mobility domains, such as in
   wireless LAN access architectures, based on IEEE 802.11 standards.

   Figure 2, illustrates the scenario where the MAG [RFC5213] is

3.2.  Key Considerations

   Wireless LAN architectures have evolved from single autonomous access
   points to systems consisting of a centralized wireless LAN Controller
   and access points.  In today's deployments, the wireless LAN
   controller and the access points are configured to perform certain
   manageability (Ex: CAPWAP) related functions.  For enabling network-
   based mobility management in these architectures, based on Proxy

   Mobile IPv6, these network elements must apply the following
   considerations.

   o  The local mobility anchor [RFC5213] function can be collocated on
      any access edge device, such as an access controller.  This access
      controller in in some deployments can be configured to host both
      the mobility management and other provisioning functions (as
      specified in CAPWAP specifications, [RFC5415] and [RFC5415]).  In
      some deployments, these functions can be non-collocated).

   o  If the access point is configured to operate as an IP router
      (layer-3 device), with IP forwarding enabled between the wireless
      and wired links, the mobile access gateway [RFC5213] function can
      be collocated on the access point.

   o  If the access point is configured to operate as a bridge (layer-2
      device), with layer-2 bridging enabled between the wireless and
      wired links, the mobile access gateway [RFC5213] function can be
      collocated on the aggregation device terminating the layer-2
      devices.

   o  The mobile access gateway when sending the Proxy Binding Update
      message MUST identify the access technology type, it MUST include
      the Access Technology Type [RFC5213] option, and the value in the
      option MUST be set to (4) (IEEE 802.11a/b/g).

   o  The All the network entities in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain MUST be
      able to identify a mobile node, using its MN-Identifier [RFC5213].
      This identifier MUST be stable and unique across the Proxy Mobile
      IPv6 domain.  The mobility entities in the Proxy Mobile IPv6
      domain MUST be able to use this identifier in the signaling
      messages and unambiguously identify a given mobile node.  The
      mobile access MUST learn this identifier from the access
      authentication mechanisms as specified in
      [draft-liebsch-netext-pmip6-authiwk].

   o  The Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol is designed to support a Per-MN-
      Prefix [RFC5213] model.  In this model, each mobile node is
      assigned a set of unique IPv6 prefixes which are not shared with
      any other node.  The mobile access gateway ensures, the Router
      Advertisement [RFC4861] messages that a mobile node receives
      contains its own set of IPv6 prefixes.  In access networks where
      the link between the mobile node and the mobile access is a point-
      to-point link, supporting this semantic does not require any
      special considerations.  However, on IEEE 802.11 based access
      links, which is a shared link, the mobile access gateway MUST
      transmit the multicast messages as unicast messages on the link-
      layer.  This approach is specified in

5.  Security Considerations

   All the security considerations from the base Proxy Mobile IPv6
   specifications, [RFC5213] and [RFC5844], apply equally well to Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domains supporting IEEE 802.11-based access networks.
   The support for IEEE 802.11-based access networks does not require
   any new security considerations and does not introduce any new
   security vulnerabilities known at this time.
