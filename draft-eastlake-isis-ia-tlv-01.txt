                  <draft-eastlake-isis-ia-tlv-01.txt>


Abstract

   This document specifies an IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate
   System) TLV that enables the reporting by an Intermediate System of
   sets of addresses of different types such that all of the addresses
   in each set designate the same interface (port). For example, an
   EUI-48 MAC (Extended Unique Identifier 48-bit, Media Access Control)
   address, IPv4 address, and IPv6 address can be reported as all
   corresponding to the same interface. Such information could be used,
   for example, to synthesize responses to or by-pass the need for the
   Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) or the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)
   protocol in some cases.

1. Introduction

   This document specifies an IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate
   System [ISO-10589] [RFC1195]) TLV that enables the reporting by an
   Intermediate System in its LSP (Link State PDU) of sets of addresses
   of different types such that all of the addresses in each set
   designate the same interface (port). For example, an EUI-48 MAC
   (Extended Unique Identifier 48-bit, Media Access Control [RFC5342])
   address, IPv4 address, and IPv6 address can be reported as all three
   corresponding to the same interface.  Such information could be used,
   for example, to synthesize responses to or by-pass the need for the
   Address Resolution Protocol (ARP, [RFC826]), Reverse Address
   Resolution Protocol (RARP, [RFC903]) or the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   (ND [RFC4861]) protocols in some cases.

   Although, in some IETF protocols, address field types are represented
   by EtherType [802] or Hardware Type [RFC5494] only Address Family
   Number is used in this TLV.

2. The Interface Addresses TLV

   The Interface Addresses TLV is used to indicate that a set of
   addresses indicate the same interface. These addresses can be in
   different address families. For example, it can be used to declare
   that an interface has a particular IPv4 address, IPv6 address, and
   EUI-48 MAC address.

   The Template Size gives the number of AFNs present below. The set of
   AFNs preent give a template for the type and order of addresses in
   each Address Set.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Type = TBD    |                  (1 byte)

                    Figure 1. The Interface Addresses TLV

   o  Type: Interface Addresses TLV type, set to TBD[#247 suggested]
      (IA-TLV).

   o  Length: Variable, minimum 7. If length is 6 or less, the TLV MUST

      be ignored.

   o  E: The E (rEachability) flag is set to one to indicate that the
      interfaces whose addresses are being given in the TLV are
      reachable through the Intermediate System that is advertising the
      TLV.

   o  RESV: Reserved. MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

   o  Topology-ID: This field carries a topology ID [RFC5120] or zero if
      topologies are not in use.

   o  Addr Set End: The unsigned offset of the byte, within the TLV
      value part, of the last byte of the last Address Set. This will be
      the byte just before the first sub-TLV if any sub-TLVs are
      present. [RFC5305]

   o  Confidence: This 8-bit quantity indicates the confidence level in
      the addresses being transported.  The semantics of the Confidence
      are further defined by the technology using the IA-TLV.

   o  Template Size: A byte containing the unsigned integer number K of
      AFNs (Address Family Numbers) in the template specifying the
      structure of each Address Set occurring later in the TLV. The
      minimum valid value is 1 and there must be room in the TLV for the
      AFNs. If Template Size is zero or too big, the TLV MUST be
      ignored.

   o  AFN: A two-byte Address Family Number. The number of AFNs present
      is given in the Template Size field. This sequence specifies the
      structure of the Address Sets occurring later in the TLV. For
      example, if Template Size is 2 and the two AFNs present are the
      AFNs for IPv4 and EUI-48, in that order, then each Address set
      present will consist of a 4-byte IPv4 address followed by a 6-byte
      MAC address. If any AFNs are present that are unknown to the
      receiving IS and the length of the corresponding address is not
      provided by a sub-TLV as specified below, the receiving IS will be
      unable to parse the Address Sets and MUST ignore the enclosing
      TLV.

   o  Address Set: Each address set consists of a sequence of Template
      Size number of addresses of the types given by the AFN sequence
      template earlier in the TLV in the same order as those AFNs. No
      alignment, other than to a byte boundary, is guaranteed. The
      addresses in each Address Set are contiguous with no unused bytes
      between them and the Address Sets are contiguous with no unused
      bytes between Address Sets. The Address Sets must fit within the
      TLV. If the product of the size of an Address Set and the number
      of Address Sets is so large that this is not true, the TLV is
      ignored.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                    IA TLV


   o  sub-TLVs: If the Address Sets indicated by Addr Sets End do not
      completely fill the Length of the TLV, the remaining bytes are
      parsed as sub-TLVs [RFC5305]. These sub-TLVs are from a new
      sequence of sub-TLVs. Any such sub-TLVs that are not known to the
      receiving IS are ignored. Should this not be possible, for example
      there is only one remaining byte or an apparent sub-TLV extends
      beyond the end of the TLV, the containing IA-TLV is considered
      corrupt and is ignored. Several sub-TLV types are specified in
      Section 3.

   This Reachable Interface Addresses TLV occurs only within LSP PDUs
   and may occur multiple times in the same or different LSP PDUs with
   the same or different templates.

   Different IA-TLVs within the same or different LSP PDUs from the same
   IS may have different templates. The same AFN may occur more than
   once in a template and the same address may occur in more than one
   address set. For example, an EUI-48 MAC address interface might have
   three IPv6 addresses. This could be represented by an IA-TLV whose
   template specifically provided for one EUI-48 address and three IPv6
   addresses, which might be an efficient format if there were multiple
   interfaces with that pattern. Alternatively, a template with one
   EUI-48 and one IPv6 address could be used in an IA-TLV with three
   address sets each having the same EUI-48 address but different IPv6
   addresses, which might be the most efficient format if only one
   interface had multiple IPv6 addresses and other interfaces had only
   one IPv6 address.

   In order to be able to parse the Address Sets, a receiving IS must
   know at least the size of the address each AFN in the Temple
   specifies; however, the presence of the Addr Set End field means that
   the sub-TLVs, if any, can always be located by a receiving IS.  An IS
   can be assumed to know the size of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (AFNs 1
   and 2) and the size of the additional AFNs allocated by the IANA
   Considerations below. Should an IS wish to include an AFN that some
   receiving IS in the campus may not know, it SHOULD include an AFN-
   Size sub-TLV as described below. If an IA-RLV is received with one or
   more AFNs in its template for which the receiving IS does not know
   the length and for which an AFN-Size sub-TLV is not present, that IA-
   TLV will be ignored.

3 IA-TLV sub-TLVs

   IA-TLVs may have trailing sub-TLVs [RFC5305] as specified below.
   These sub-TLVs occur after the Address Sets and the amount of space
   available for sub-TLVs is determined from the overall IA-TLV length
   and the value of the Addr Set End byte.

   There is no ordering restriction on IA-TLV sub-TLVs. Unless otherwise
   specified each sub-TLV type can occur zero, one, or many times in an
   IA-TLV.



3.1 AFN Size sub-TLV

   Using this sub-TLV, the originating IS can specify the size of an
   address type. This is useful under two circumstances:

   1. One or more AFNs that are unknown to the receiving IS appears in
      the template. If an AFN Size sub-TLV is present for each such AFN,
      the at least the IA-TLV can be parses the Address Sets and make
      use of any address types present that it does understand.

   2. If an AFN occurs in the template that represents a variable length
      address, this sub-TLV gives its size for all occurrences in that
      IA-TLV.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |subType = AFNsz|                  (1 byte)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Length        |                  (1 byte)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | AFN Size Record(s)                            |  (3 bytes)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Where each AFN Size Record is structured as follows:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  AFN                          |  (2 bytes)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  AdrSize      |                  (1 byte)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Type: AFN-Size sub-TLV type, set to 1 (AFNsz).

   o  Length: 3*n where n is the number of AFN Size Records present. If
      n is not a multiple of 3, the sub-TLV MUST be ignored.

   o  AFN Size Record(s): Zero or more 3-byte records, each giving the
      size of an address type identified by an AFN,


D. Eastlake, et al.                                             [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                    IA TLV


   o  AFN: The AFN whose length is being specified by the AFN Size
      Record.

   o  AdrSize: The length of the address specified by the AFN field.

   This sub-TLV may occur multiple times in an enclosing IA-TLV.

   The declaration of a size for an AFN address type controls for the
   occurrences of the AFN in the enclosing IA-TLV and for and subsequent
   IA-TLVs in the enclosing LSP PDU until the next occurrence in the LSP
   PDU of an AFN Size sub-TLV for that AFN.  Thus, an AFN Size sub-TLV
   for a fixed size AFN need only be included in the first IA-TLV in a
   PDU. But one must be included in or before first IA-TLV using an AFN
   in each PDU where that AFN appears in the template if needed.
   Otherwise Address Sets will not be parseable by a receiving IS. If
   multiple AFN Size Records occur for the same AFN in the same AFN Size
   sub-TLV the last size given controls.

   An AFN Size sub-TLV for any AFN known to the receiving IS (which
   always includes AFN 1 and 2 and the AFNs specified in Section 5) is
   compared with the size known to the IS and if they differ, the
   enclosing IA-TLV is ignored.



3.2 Data Label sub-TLV

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |Type==DATA-LABEL|                 (1 byte)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Length        |                 (1 byte)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...
      | Data Label                      (variable)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...

   o  Type: Data Label sub-TLV type, set to 2 (DATA-LABEL).

   o  Length: variable, minimum 1. If Length is zero, the sub-TLV MUST
      be ignored.

   o  Data Label: A data label under which all the interfaces listed in
      the TLV can be reached. Exact meaning for different lengths
      depends on the technology in use. If absent, no label is
      specified. If more than one different Data Label sub-TLV occurs in
      an Interface Addresses TLV, it indicates that the interfaces
      listed can be reach via all the labels given.

      For TRILL use, if Length=2, the Data Label is a VLAN-ID which
      appears right justified in two bytes with four leading bits that
      MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

3.3 Nickname sub-TLV

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |Type=NICKNAME  |                 (1 byte)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Length        |                 (1 byte)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...
      | Nickname                        (variable)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...

   o  Type: Data Label sub-TLV type, set to 3 (NICKNAME).

   o  Length: variable, minimum 1. If Length is zero, the sub-TLV MUST
      be ignored.

   o  Nickname: The nickname of an Intermediate System through which all
      the interfaces listed in the TLV can be reached. Exact meaning for
      different lengths depends on the technology in use. If absent, no
      nickname is specified. If more than one different Nickname sub-TLV
      occurs in an Interface Addresses TLV, it indicates that the
      interfaces listed can be reach via all the nicknames given.
      Occurrence of one or more Nickname sub-TLVs in an Interface
      Addresses TLV does not change the effect of the E flag bit in the
      TLV initial fixed fields; the E flag having the value one still
      indicates that the interfaces are reachable through the
      Intermediate System advertising the TLV.



3.4 Fixed Address sub-TLV

   There may be cases where, in an Interface Addresses TLV, the same
   address would appear across every address set in the TLV. To avoid
   having a larger template and wasted space in all Address Sets, this
   sub-TLV can be used to indicate such a fixed address

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |Type=FIXEDADR  |                 (1 byte)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Length        |                 (1 byte)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | AFN           |                 (2 bytes)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...
      | Fixed Address                   (variable)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...

   o  Type: Data Label sub-TLV type, set to 4 (FIXEDADR).

   o  Length: variable, minimum 3. If Length is 2 or less, the sub-TLV
      MUST be ignored.

5. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new TLV number for IA-TLV [#247
   suggested because #147 is the MAC Reachability (MAC-RI) TLV].

   IANA is requested to allocate three new AFN numbers as follows:

      Number   Description  References

      TBD(26)  EUI-48      RFC 5342, this document
      TBD(27)  EUI-64      RFC 5342, this document
      TBD(28)  IPv6/64     This document.

   [[[Curiously enough, the AFN RFC references seem to always use
   "Address Family Identifier" although IANA uses "Address Family
   Number". Furthermore, neither of the two RFCs pointed to by the IANA
   Address Family Number Registry actually has IANA Considerations for
   Address Family Numbers although the IANA Registry has shows policies
   for different ranges of AFNs. Conceivably, such IANA Considerations
   should appear in this document.]]]

   IPv6/64 is an 8-byte quantity that is the first 64 bits of an IPv6
   address. If present, there will normally be an EUI-64 or EUI-48
   address in the address set to provide the lower 64 bits of the IPv6
   address. For this purpose, an EUI-48 is expanded to 64 bits as
   described in [RFC5342].

   IANA is requested to establish a new subregistry for sub-TLVs of the
   IA-TLV with initial contents as shown below.
