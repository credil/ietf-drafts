  The WebRTC Data Channel as a Transport for the Message Session Relay
                            Protocol (MSRP)
                        draft-pd-msrp-webrtc-00

Abstract

   The WebRTC Data Channel enables two-way real-time communication
   between browsers.  This document updates normatively updates RFC 4975
   to add support for WebRTC Data Channel as a transport for MSRP
   (Message Session Relay Protocol).  This will enable secure, low-
   latency, structured peer-to-peer messaging between WebRTC end-points.

Internet-Draft        MSRP over WebRTC Data Channel             May 2013


1.  Introduction

   The WebRTC Data Channel [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] enables
   secure, reliable, low-latency message exchange between browsers.
   Network Address Translation (NAT) issues between browsers are handled
   through the use of ICE [RFC5245].

   Modern web browsers include a WebRTC client stack complying with the
   WebRTC API [WEBRTC-API] as specified by the W3C. The specification in
   this document enables usage of MSRP in these scenarios.

   This specification updates MSRP [RFC4975] to support WebRTC Data
   Channel as a transport for the exchange of MSRP messages between
   browsers.

   MSRP over WebRTC is well suited for MSRP interactions between clients
   that require security, reliability, low-latency, and where there are
   no local policies requiring authorisation and/or logging of
   interactions.  For client-to-server messaging or where local policy
   requires authentication and/or logging MSRP over WebSocket
   [I-D.pd-dispatch-msrp-websocket] should be considered.


2.  Terminology

   All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-
   normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
   Everything else in this specification is normative.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Definitions

   MSRP WebRTC Client:  An MSRP entity capable of opening WebRTC Data
         Channel connections to other MSRP entities.


3.  The WebRTC Data Channel

   _This section is non-normative._

   The WebRTC Data Channel [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] is a transport
   layer on top of SCTP over DTLS over UDP in which clients exchange
   message units in both directions.

   WebRTC Data Channel defines message units to be used by applications



Dunkley & Llewellyn     Expires November 11, 2013               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        MSRP over WebRTC Data Channel             May 2013


   for the exchange of data, so it provides a message boundary-
   preserving transport layer.  These message units contain binary data.


4.  MSRP WebRTC Data Channel Transport

4.1.  General

   Each MSRP chunk MUST be carried within a single Data Channel message,
   and a Data Channel message MUST NOT contain more than one MSRP chunk.

      This simplifies parsing of MSRP messages for clients.  When large
      messages are sent MSRP chunking (as defined in section 5.1 of
      [RFC4975]) MUST be used to split the message into several smaller
      MSRP chunks.

4.2.  Updates to RFC 4975

4.2.1.  MSRP URI Transport Parameter

   This document defines the value "dc" as the transport parameter value
   for an MSRP URI [RFC3986] to be contacted using WebRTC Data Channel
   as transport.

   The updated augmented BNF (Backus-Naur Form) [RFC5234] for this
   parameter is the following (the original BNF for this parameter can
   be found in [RFC4975]):

     transport  =  "tcp" / "dc" / 1*ALPHANUM

4.2.2.  SDP

   When using MSRP over WebRTC the SDP connection and media-lines will
   be generated by browser when the "createOffer" method
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-jsep] is called.  MSRP WebRTC Clients MUST NOT
   create connection and media-lines as described in section 8.1 of
   [RFC4975].

   Other MSRP related SDP fields are contained within attribute-lines
   which MUST be added to browser generated SDP.

   As all MSRP over WebRTC messages are routed directly between MSRP
   WebRTC Clients there are no backwards compatibility issues with non-
   WebRTC MSRP clients.

   The "dc" transport parameter will appear in the endpoint URI in SDP
   "path" attribute ([RFC4975] section 8.2).

Internet-Draft        MSRP over WebRTC Data Channel             May 2013


4.3.  Opening Data Channels for MSRP

   Section 5.4 of [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp] defines the "subprotocol
   Attribute" enabling the client to indicate which protocol it would
   like to speak on a channel.  This document defines a new subprotocol
   of "MSRP" which MUST be used on channels carrying MSRP over WebRTC.

   When establishing MSRP sessions clients often include a lot of meta-
   data [RFC5547] about the intended use of the session in attribute-
   lines within the SDP (for example, when performing file-transfer
   filename, type, and size are indicated).  There is no information in
   these attribute-lines that that will enable a client to associate
   them with a specific channel.  To solve this issue MSRP WebRTC
   Clients MUST create SCTP associations with only 1 channel (that is,
   one stream in each direction).

      Section 5 of [I-D.jesup-rtcweb-data-protocol] allows applications
      to specify the number of streams for an SCTP association.  It is
      usually the case that more streams are desirable to enable
      additional communication between browsers without the need for
      renegotiation and to create new Data Channels; this is not
      applicable to MSRP.  Additional MSRP sessions require renegotion
      so that the meta-data [RFC5547] describing the intended use of the
      session can be exchanged.


5.  Examples

5.1.  SDP exchange

   The following example shows SDP that could be included in a SIP
   message to set up an MSRP session between Alice and Bob.

   Note that SDP does not permit line folding.  A "\" in the examples
   shows a line continuation due to limitations in line length of this
   document.  Neither the backslash nor the extra CRLF is included in
   the actual SDP.

   Alice makes an offer:


   m=application 54111 DTLS/SCTP 5000
   c=IN IP4 79.97.215.79
   a=sctpmap:5000 webrtc-DataChannel 1
   a=webrtc-DataChannel:5000 \
     stream=1;label="channel 1";subprotocol="msrp"
   a=accept-types:message/cpim text/plain text/html
   a=path:msrp://df7jal23ls0d.invalid:5000/98cjs;dc

Internet-Draft        MSRP over WebRTC Data Channel             May 2013


   In this offer, Alice wishes to receive MSRP messages using the WebRTC
   Data Channel.  She can accept message/cpim, text/plain, and text/html
   message bodies in SEND requests.

   Bob's answer to this offer could look like:


   m=application 63241 DTLS/SCTP 3000
   c=IN IP4 79.97.215.84
   a=sctpmap:3000 webrtc-DataChannel 1
   a=webrtc-DataChannel:3000
     stream=1;label="channel 1";subprotocol="msrp"
   a=accept-types:message/cpim text/plain
   a=path:msrp://jk3apo92lf5w.invalid:3000/20ksw;dc

   Here Bob wishes to receive the MSRP messages.  He can accept only
   message/cpim and text/plain message bodies in SEND requests and has
   rejected the text/html content offered by Alice.

5.2.  SEND


   Alice    (MSRP DC)           Bob
   |                             |
   |SEND F1                      |
   |---------------------------->|
   |200 OK F2                    |
   |<----------------------------|

   In the same scenario Alice sends an instant message to Bob (session
   details having been previously negotiated by some other mechanism -
   such as SDP.

   secure communication between browsers.  As such there are no specific
   security considerations for this draft.

Appendix A.  Implementation Guidelines

   _This section is non-normative._

A.1.  MSRP WebRTC Client Considerations

   The JavaScript stack in web browsers does not have the ability to
   discover the local transport address used for originating WebRTC
   connections.  Therefore the MSRP WebSocket Client constructs a domain
   name consisting of a random token followed by the ".invalid" top-
   level domain name, as stated in [RFC2606], and uses it within its
   From-Path headers.
