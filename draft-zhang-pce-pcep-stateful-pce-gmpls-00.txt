   The Path Computation Element (PCE) facilitates Traffic Engineering 
   (TE) based path calculation in large, multi-domain, multi-region, or 
   multi-layer networks. PCE can be stateless or stateful. With the LSP 
   state information acquired from the network, a stateful PCE exhibits 
   superiority in facilitating a wide variety of applications, 
   especially in GMPLS networks, such as impairment-aware routing and 
   wavelength assignment in wavelength-switched optical networks (WSON), 
   time-based scheduling applications. This memo provides extensions 
   required for PCE communication protocol (i.e. PCEP) so as to enable 
   the usage of a stateful PCE capability in GMPLS networks. To be more 
   specific, the PCEP extensions specified in this memo include not 
   only new objects but also modification of existing objects in PCEP 
   messages, with regard to stateful PCE usage in GMPLS networks.

1. Introduction 

   [RFC 4655] presents the architecture of a Path Computation Element 
   (PCE)-based model for computing Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) 
   and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched 
   Paths (TE LSPs). To perform such a constrained computation, a PCE 
   stores the network topology (i.e., TE links and nodes) and resource 
   information (i.e., TE attributes) in its TE Database (TED). To 
   request path computation services to a PCE, [RFC 5440] defines the 
   PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path 
   Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between two PCEs. A PCC can 
   initiate a path computation request to a PCE through a Path 
   Computation Request (PCReq) message, and then the PCE will return 
   the computed route to the requesting PCC in response to a previously 
   received PCReq message through a PCEP Path Computation Reply (PCRep) 
   message.  

   As per [RFC 4655], a PCE can be stateless or stateful. Compared to a 
   stateless PCE, a stateful PCE stores not only the network state, but 
   also the set of computed paths and reserved resources in use in the 
   network. Note that [RFC4655] further specifies that the TED contains 
   link state and bandwidth availability as distributed by IGPs or 
   collected via other means. Even if such information can provide 
   finer granularity and more details, it is not state information in 
   the PCE context and so a model that uses it is still described as a 
   stateless PCE.  

   Stateful PCE(s) are shown to be helpful in many application 
   scenarios, especially in GMPLS networks, as illustrated in 
   [Stateful-APP]. In order for these applications to able to exploit 
   the capability of stateful PCE(s), extensions to the PCE 
   communication protocol (i.e., PCEP) are required.  

   It is expected that there are common aspects for stateful PCE PCEP 
   extension in GMPLS networks with that in MPLS networks [Stateful-
   PCE]. Therefore, this document focuses on the extensions unique to 
   GMPLS networks while maintains a complete picture of the PCEP 
   extensions required for a stateful PCE. In summary, this draft gives 
   an overview of PCEP extensions necessary for stateful PCE usage in 
   GMPLS networks as well as the details of required PCEP extension 
   unique to stateful PCE usage in GMPLS networks.

2. PCEP Extensions  

2.1. Overview 

   According to the description in [Stateful-APP], a summary of PCEP 
   extensions required for stateful PCE in GMPLS networks is provided 
   as follows: 

   o Advertisement and negotiation of stateful PCE capability;  

   o LSP synchronization; 

   These two are fundamental extension requirements needed in order to 
   make a stateful PCE functional. Attention should be paid in terms of 
   the general considerations as discussed in [Stateful-APP]. Since the 
   extensions to these two aspects are straightforward and have already 
   been covered in [Stateful-PCE], we only cover the points that are 
   either relevant to GMPLS or still missing in [Stateful-PCE].  

   o LSP Delegation; 

   As explained in [Stateful-APP], the ability to collect LSP state 
   information should be mandatory. As for PCE's ability to modify the 
   LSP attributes as presented in [Stateful-PCE] as well as how it is 
   enabled (per PCE base, per LSP base, or per NE base?) should be 
   operator-dependent and is for further study.  

   o Simplification of the existing PCEP protocol [RFC5440]; 

   Since the LSP state is part of the information that a stateful PCE 
   possesses, some simplifications to PCEP are possible and explained 
   in this draft. 

   o Application-specific extensions desired; 

   A list of examples is provided in [Stateful-APP] and they may 
   require additional extensions or modification of the PCEP protocol. 
   In this draft, we present the PCEP extensions for some typical 
   application examples.  

2.2. PCEP Extension for Stateful PCE Capability Advertisement and 
   Negotiation 

   Whether a PCE has the stateful capability or not can be negotiated 
   during the PCEP session establishment process. It can also be 
   advertised through routing protocols as described in [RFC5088]. In 
   either case, the following additional aspects should also be 
   considered.

 2.2.1. PCE Capability Negotiation/Advertisement in Multi-layer Networks 

   In multi-layer network scenarios where there is a PCE responsible 
   for each layer, then the PCCs should be informed of which PCE they 
   should synchronize their LSP states with as well as send path 
   computation requests to.  

   A new LayerCapability TLV is defined as shown below to denote to 
   which layer a PCE is in charge of LSP synchronization as well as 
   path computation. It can be included in the OPEN Object if 
   applicable. Alternatively, the extension to current OSPF PCED TLV is 
   needed.

2.3. LSP Delegation  

   If a LSP span across multiple domains and the delegation features 
   presented in [Stateful-PCE] is supported, it adds complexity to LSP 
   state synchronization/update. For instance, in a multi-domain 
   networks where one PCE per domain is adopted, a contiguous LSP is 
   setup which spans across multiple domains. Then, each PCE is 
   responsible for synchronizing/updating or is able to modify only 
   part of the LSP within the network for which the PCE is deployed. 
   Moreover, a modification action of a stateful PCE for partial LSP 
   may trigger a chain of LSP updating actions (e.g., informing other 
   PCEs of the modification or requesting other PCEs of additional 
   modification).  

   This needs to be considered carefully and modification capability 
   specifications might be needed to limit the scope of LSP attribute 
   modification action to avoid conflicts(?).

   [Editor Note: this needs clarification and further discussion. The 
   scenario with mixed stateful/stateless PCE might also cause 
   potential issues for LSP delegation ability.] 

2.4. PCEP Extensions for LSP Synchronization 

   For LSP state synchronization of stateful PCE(s) in GMPLS networks, 
   the LSP attributes, such as its bandwidth, associated label as well 
   as protection information etc, should be updated by PCC(s) to PCE 
   LSP database (LSP-DB).  

   As per [Stateful-PCE], it only covers LSP attributes pertaining to 
   MPLS networks, based on [RFC5440]. Therefore, extensions of PCEP 
   protocol for stateful PCE usage in GMPLS networks are required. The 
   following presents a list of objects/TLVs that should be used by 
   stateful PCE for LSP synchronization purpose when applied in GMPLS 
   networks: 

   o GENERALIZED BANDWIDTH 

   o PROTECTION ATTRIBUTE  

   o Extended Objects to support the inclusion of label sub-object 

     - RP 

     - IRO 

     - XRO 

   Note that the list above should also be used for path computation 
   requests/replies. Refer to [PCEP-GMPLS] for the details of these 
   objects/TLVs. 

2.5.  PCEP Simplification  

   One of the merits mentioned in [Stateful-APP] is its ability to 
   simplify the information exchange between PCC and PCE. To be more 
   specific, with a stateful PCE, it is possible for PCCs to carry only 
   LSP ID information, instead of giving detailed LSP information (such 
   as route), whenever necessary.  

   Example 1: a PCC (e.g. NMS) requesting for a re-optimization of 
   several LSPs, it can send the request with relevant LSP IDs. 

   In order to support these, the LSP identifier TLV defined in 
   [Stateful-PCE] can be used in the RP Object to specify the request 
   LSP ID(s). Upon receiving the PCReq message, PCE should be able to 
 
 
Zhang                   Expires January 2013                  [Page 6] 

draft-zhang-pce-pcep-stateful-pce-gmpls-00.txt                July 2012 
    

   correlate with one or multiple LSPs with their detailed state 
   information and carry out optimization accordingly. 

   Example 2: in order to set up a LSP which is diversified with one or 
   more specific LSPs, a PCC can send a PCReq with the ID of these LSPs. 
   A stateful PCE should be able to find the corresponding route and 
   resource information so as to meet the constraints set by the 
   requesting PCC.  

   In order to support this, a new subobject type should be supported, 
   i.e. LSP ID(s). Hence, the LSP identifier TLV defined in [Stateful-
   PCE] can be used in XRO object for this purpose.   

2.6.  Application-specific PCEP extensions for stateful PCE  

   [Editor's Note: this is not a complete list of application-specific 
   PCEP extensions. Suggestions are welcome on expansion on this 
   section.] 

 2.6.1. Time-based Scheduling  

   To support time-based scheduling, network operators need to reserve 
   resources in advance according to customers' requests with specified 
   starting time and duration. A simple utilization example of this 
   service is to support scheduled data transmission between data 
   centers or any generic scheduled based services.  

   Traditionally, this can be supported by NMS operation through path 
   pre-establishment and activation on the agreed starting time. 
   However, this does not provide efficient network usage since the 
   established paths exclude the possibility of being used by other 
   services even when they are not used for undertaking any service due 
   to the lack of a time-based mechanism. It can also be accomplished 
   through GMPLS protocol extensions by carrying the related request 
   information (e.g., starting time and duration) across the network. 
   Nevertheless, this method inevitably increases the complexity of 
   signaling and routing process. 

   Since a stateful PCE needs to collect LSP related information for 
   the whole network, it can naturally support this service with 
   resource usage flexibility (i.e., only excluding the time slot(s) 
   reserved for time-based scheduling requests). Moreover, it can avoid 
   the need to add complexity on network elements in this regard. A 
   stateful PCE should also maintain a database that stores all the 
   reserved information with time reference. This can be achieved 
   either by maintaining a separate database or having all the reserved 
   information with time reference incorporated into LSP-DB. The 
   details of organizing time-based scheduling related information are

   subject to network provider's policy and administrative 
   consideration and thus outside of the scope of this document. 

2.6.1.1. PCEP Extension 

   For a PCC to request a path computation for scheduled service, it 
   MUST be able to specify the time-related information, including the 
   starting time and LSP holding time, in PCEP request.  

   A SERVICE-TIME object is presented as follows to provide the 
   required information (i.e. service starting time and holding time). 

   The Object-Class is TBD and the Object-Type is 1.

   Upon receiving the PCReq message, PCE should compute the path taking 
   into consideration the constraints of the TED, LSP-DB as well as 
   other scheduled service information and return the computed route 
   back to the requesting PCC.  

   If no path can be found, PCE should return an error message 
   specifying the reason.  

 2.6.2. RWA in Impairment-aware Wavelength-switched Optical Networks 
    (WSON) 

   In impairment-ware WSON networks, the routing and wavelength 
   assignment process needs to consider the constraints incurred by the 
   physical impairments. As described in [Stateful-APP], stateful PCE 
   can effectively reduce the control plane overhead by centrally 
   maintaining the impairment-information related to each LSP.

   o OSNR 

   o PMD  

   o T.B.D. 

   Upon receiving the path computation request, a stateful PCE should 
   take into consideration the explicitly defined constraints as well 
   as those of the existing LSPs, stored in LSP-DB. Furthermore, a PCE 
   may need to reply in PCRep with the actual values of the one or more 
   of the above-mentioned parameters to the requesting PCC as well as 
   the adjustment needed. After receiving the reply message, the PCC 
   can take appropriate actions along the to-be-established paths in 
   tuning its power or changing other impairment-related parameters so 
   as to achieve the desired signal quality.  

   To support the above-mentioned requirements, the METRIC object 
   defined in [RFC5440] can be exploited with proper extension. A new 
   type value should be added. 

   T=T.B.D.: Impairment-aware information 

   Furthermore, as described in [PCE-IA-WSON], there are two types of 
   parameters that can be specified, i.e. path level or link level. If 
   a stateful PCE needs to reply with adjustment needed for path level 
   parameters. Then further extension to the METRIC object is desirable 
   and this will be considered in the future.
