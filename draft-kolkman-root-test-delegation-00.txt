   Using Test Delegations from the Root Prior to Full Allocation and
                               Delegation
                 draft-kolkman-root-test-delegation-00

Abstract

   The delegation of certain strings as TLDs will cause stability and
   security issues if such strings have been used in private
   environments prior to their delegation.  It is recommended that test
   delegations be used to enable empirical research on the extent of the
   possible disruption prior to actual allocation and delegation of any
   label in the root zone.

1.  Introduction and Motivation

   [[The authors are aware that this first version of the document does
   is not fully consistent.  However they would value feedback on
   whether the idea is worth further pursuance.]]

   [Editor not: An appropriate mailinglist for discussion of this draft
   has not yet been identified]

   DNS names have always co-existed with other namespaces that are
   virtually indistinguishable from the DNS. The DNS was itself deployed
   alongside the host [RFC0822] table.  NetBIOS [NETBIOS] names, though
   only one label long, could always interact with the DNS search path
   mechanism to generate DNS names.  Additionally, mDNS [RFC6762] names
   often look just like DNS names.  Because different naming systems are
   usually linked together in the user interface, from an end user's
   point of view these name spaces are all one -- even though they
   function differently on the Internet.

   While [RFC6761] reserved certain special names for internal or
   private use, there is evidence [SAC45] that various sites connected
   to the Internet have used other names for internal purposes.  In
   fact, [RFC6762] advises not to use .local for private use and
   observes: "the following top-level domains have been used on private
   internal networks without the problems caused by trying to reuse
   ".local."  for this purpose:"

      .intranet.

      .internal.

      .private.

      .corp.

      .home.

      .lan.

   In the event such names are delegated for use in the public DNS,
   there will be inevitable consequences for sites that have used those
   names.  Some of those consequences have implications for security,
   with the potential for leakage of credentials and HTTP cookies
   ([RFC6265]). Responsible administration of the public namespace
   therefore requires great care in permitting public delegation of any
   name when there is good reason to suppose it is in widespread use as
   a private namespace, even though such private namespaces are (from
   the point of view of the DNS) irregular, even if common.

1.1.  Search-path interaction.

   In many cases a string appears to be used as an "undelegated TLD"
   (being used as the rightmost label in an name), but this is simply an
   artifact of domain search list processing.

   For example, suppose the Example Widgets corporation uses a sub-
   domain (.corp) of their primary domain (example.com) to name their
   employee workstations, servers, printers and similar.  They have an
   "intranet" server named intranet.corp.example.com.  In order to allow
   their employees to simply type "intranet.corp" to access this server,
   the users' workstations are configured (probably using [RFC3379])
   with the search-list set to "corp.example.com, example.com".

   When a user enters "intranet.corp", their workstation will try and
   resolve the name.  RFC1535 [RFC1535] specifies that "in any event
   where a "."  exists in a specified name it should be assumed to be a
   fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and SHOULD be tried as a rooted
   name first."  So, the user's workstation will first try and resolve
   "intranet.corp.".  As there is (currently) no .corp TLD this will
   result in an NXDOMAIN response.  The workstation will then append
   entries in the search-list until it is able to resolve the (now
   fully-qualified) name.

   If the .corp label were to be delegated as a TLD and the sub-domain
   "intranet" created within .corp, the first lookup ("intranet.corp")
   would no longer generate an NXDOMAIN response.  This would stop the

   search-list processing, and direct the user somewhere other than
   where the user intended to go -- the "wrong server", in the eyes of
   the user, even if right according to the DNS.

   It is worth noting that a researcher analyzing DNS queries hitting
   the root servers would see queries before search-list processing
   expands them.  While this may not change whether or not it is safe to
   delegate these names, having an understanding of the cause is
   valuable.

1.2.  Scire est mensurare

   The local use of undelegated top-level domain names is troublesome
   because it produces different experience depending on the search path
   and location of a given device.  That is a normal effect of the
   search path mechanism or the roaming of users, but with the advent of
   new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), the problem gets more acute,
   because many TLDs are intended to be mnemonics that will be intuitive
   to humans.  Since names higher in the DNS tree are likely also to use
   those same intuitive labels, there is potential for user confusion
   and information leakage.

   At the same time, it is not clear that the DNS protocol was designed
   around a static list of top-level domains (TLDs), and therefore it
   seems reasonable to plan for the possible addition of new TLDs whose
   use might conflict with deployed search path settings.  Yet prudent
   operation of the root zone requires that deployment of new names in
   the root should not cause widespread untoward effects for users of
   the DNS, particularly when those users are relying on features that
   have always been part of the protocol.

   What is needed is a mechanism to test whether a particular delegation
   from the root zone presents a serious conflict with widespread use.
   This memo presents a methodology for making such a determination.

   The methodology depends on temporary delegation of the top-level
   domains in question, and the use of a domain under an existing TLD in
   order to capture and compare queries generated by a large number of
   querying sources under the control of the experiment.

2.  Terms and Conventions Used in this Memo

   The mechanism outlined here is intended to complement the analysis
   already performed in "Name Collision in the DNS" [namecollision].  We
   therefore use the terms defined in section 1.1 of [namecollision]
   whenever appropriate.

   Note that the evaluation methodology outlined here is intended to be
   complementary input to a risk analysis e.g.  as found in
   [namecollision]; risk tradeofs are likely to include other factors
   than the effects measured herewith.

3.  Principle of Operation

Internet-Draft       Test Delegations From the Root       September 2013


   In order to assess whether there is significant use of a given
   candidate string (CandidateTLD), probes will send out sets of queries
   from a large number of random locations.  The queries are answered by
   dedicated servers that collect statistics.  In this section we
   describe the query generation, data-collection, and what the
   dedicated servers should answer to not interfere with Internet
   traffic.

   The goal of the experiment is to assess whether there is significant
   existing use of a single CandidateTLD.

3.1.  Measurements Servers and Zones

   In addition to the candidate string ("CandidateTLD") the methodology
   uses a specific sting "TestName".  During an experiment the Proposed
   TLD under evaluation ("CandidateTLD") and a control TLD ("TestName")
   are delegated from the root zone to a special DNS name server, the
   experiment's server.  Further, a second control name
   (TestName.ExistingTLD) is delegated from a 'common' existing TLD
   (ExistingTLD) to the experiment's server.

   The experiment's server has two functions:

   First, with one exception detailed below in Section 3.4, if any
   request for any name inside the CandidateTLD or the TestName
   namespace reaches the name server, the name server MUST respond with
   RCODE 3 (Name Error or NXDOMAIN) (Note that from a DNS client
   perspective the ultimate RCODE 3 response is indistinguishable from
   what is returned without the test delegation in place.)

   Second, the experiment's server tracks every name in any request it
   receives, the time at which the request arrived, the RRTYPE and CLASS
   in the request, and the source network for the request.

3.2.  Query Generation

   Software probes will need to be deployed throughout the Internet
   (also see Section 3.3) these probes will send, in parallel, sets of
   queries.

   Each set comprises one measurement and consists of three queries (or
   even 4, see Section 6). A measurement is identified by a unique
   measurement identifier (<uniqueid>, syntactically a valid hostname);
   the set will include the following:

      the QNAME is <uniqueid>-a.TestName.

      the QNAME is  <uniqueid>-b.TestName.CandidateTLD

Internet-Draft       Test Delegations From the Root       September 2013

      the QNAME is <uniqueid>-c.TestName.ExistingTLD

   The TestName MUST be a randomly chosen name that remains constant for
   the duration of the experiment, MUST be a syntactically valid label,
   SHOULD be semantic nonsense, an MUST NOT be delegated from the root
   or in the ExistingTLD already.

   Depending on the environment in which the probe is located the query
   that is send by a stub resolver is handled differently.  We
   distinguish 4 possibilities.

   Local CandidateTLD use without Search List: The probe is located
      within a network that locally resolves the candidateTLD and there
      are no searchlists being used that append CandidateTLD.  The query
      with a QNAME of <uniqueid>-b.TestName.CandidateTLD will not exit
      the local network while the queries with a QNAME of
      <uniqueid>-c.TestName.ExistingTLD. and QNAME of
      <uniqueid>-a.TestName.  will arrive at the authoritative servers
      for the respective domains.

   Local CandidateTLD and CandidateTLD appened Search List: The probe is
      located within a network that locally resolves the candidateTLD
      and there are searchlists being used that append CandidateTLD. The
      query with a QNAME of <uniqueid>-b.TestName.CandidateTLD will not
      exit the local network while the queries with a QNAME of
      lt;uniqueid>-c.TestName.ExistingTLD. will arrive at the
      authoritative server for the domain.  The query with a QNAME of
      <uniqueid>-a.TestName.  is subject to the search algortithm, the
      query name will effectively be substitude to
      <uniqueid>-a.TestName.CandidateTLD and be resolved localy.  The
      query for <uniqueid>-a.TestName.  will therefore not be seen at
      the authoritative server.

   No use of CandidateTLD and no use of Search List: The probe is
      located within a network that does not resolve the candidate TLD
      and no searchlists being used that append CandidateTLD. All
      queries will arrive at the authoritative servers for the
      respective domains.

   No use of CandidateTLD and CandidateTLD appended by Search List: The 
      probe is located within a network that does not resolve the
      candidate TLD but search list processing appends CandidateTLD. In
      this case the queries for Lt;uniqueid>-a.TestName.  get rewritten
      to lt;uniqueid>-a.TestName.CandidateTLD and arrive, together with
      lt;uniqueid>-b.TestName.CandidateTLD at the authoritative server
      for CandidateTLD, while queries for the QNAME
      <uniqueid>-c.TestName.ExistingTLD arrive at the server
      authoritative for TestName.ExistingTLD.

   As a result, by comparing what arrives at the authoritative servers
   one can establish the prevalence of the various scenarios.  Under the

Internet-Draft       Test Delegations From the Root       September 2013

   assumption of a broad unbiased sample exclusively observing the 3rd
   option (all queries hitting their respective servers) would be a
   strong indication that a candidate TLD is not in use.

3.3.  Sampling

   To perform the evaluation, a names of the form
   <uniqueid>.TestName.CandidateTLD and
   <uniqueid>.controlname.ExistingTLD are embedded in content that is
   placed around the web.  As people visit web sites, the content is
   processed, yielding attempts at resolution of the names.

   The easiest way to provide the content that causes the relevant DNS
   lookup is to use an online (ad) campaign.  There is no reason for the
   campaign actually to cause users to click though, so it should be as
   boring as possible.  However, the campaign must result in the
   independent resolution of both the control and test names.  Behavior
   of this sort is trivially achievable with several available online
   advertising systems.

   It is critical that the sampling be as representative of the Internet
   population as possible.  This sort of sample already has the
   significant problem that it can only measure users of the web.  And
   there may be sampling effects that might prevent measurements from
   taking place in those environments that need to be reached.  For
   instance, add-blocking or different web surfing behavior in corporate
   environements.

   The measurements should be unbiased with respect to temporal behavior
   like sleep-wake and work-rest cycles.

   [[The sampling biases probably deserve their own section with much
   more elaboration and more possible biases]]

3.4.  The Name Server

   This procedure rests on a name server that is configured and
   instrumented in particular ways.  First, the name server must be
   configurable so that it authoritative for all requests inside the
   Candidate TLD. Normally, it will always return RCODE 3 (NXDOMAIN) for
   all queries inside that Candidate TLD, except that the name server
   must also be configurable so that it is the authoritative name server
   for the test name.  All names underneath the test name, however, also
   return RCODE 3. A summary of the behavior is in Table 1.

4.  Evaluation

   [TODO align with above]

   To evaluate the results, it is only necessary to compare the number
   of resolution attempts of the test names against the resolution
   attempts of the control names.  If the test name is not in wide
   private use, then a lookups for the name unique identifier in each
   name space will arrive nearly as often and at the same time (modulo
   the difference in the recursive nameserver following the delegation
   chain) at the instrumented name server.

   If the test name is in widespread private use without a search list,
   or is otherwise resolved locally, then we should expect that lookups
   inside the test namespace will happen less often than lookups inside
   the control namespace.  If there is no search list in use, then the
   test QNAMEs of the "b" form will arrive less often than those of "a"
   form and "c" form.  If there is a search list in use, then the "a"
   form will also not arrive at the authoritative server.  If the
   CandidateTLD is in a search list, we can expect to see duplicated
   queries of the "b" form on the authoritative server (because the "a"
   form gets the search list appended).

5.  A Basis for Acceptable Behaviour

   We assume that there will always be some "stray" queries to the DNS:
   queries for names that have a TLD-label that does not exist in the
   root-zone, and which were not intended to be sent to the global DNS.
   Therefore, it is necessary to establish some baseline level of these
   "noise" queries, and then use that to evaluate whether some proposed
   new name for the DNS presents a problem.

   Because of the historic prominence of the .com TLD, it may be
   supposed that .com is, like the root itself, a special zone in which
   unusual behaviour might be expected.  Therefore, names inside the
   .com name space are a poor guide for "normal" behaviour, and it
   should not be used for making these sorts of evaluations.  The best
   guide will likely come from using TLDs that are themselves
   statistically normal.

   In addition, overwhelming conservatism suggests that using
   comparisons with the TLD that is queried least often provides a great
   margin of safety.  As of this writing, a string that is queried less
   often than that least-queried TLD seems likely not to be in
   widespread real use, and therefore comparisons with that least-
   queried TLD are a good conservative choice when evaluating.

6.  Possible Experiment Extension

   A bias to the measurement is introduced if in certain environments
   lists of existing TLDs are used in access lists of, for instance,
   firewalls.  In that case queries for the QNAME
   <uniqueid>-b.TestName.CandidateTLD might be blocked.  To calibrate
   that behavior an additional non-existent TLD could be delegated for
   the duration of the experiment:

      the QNAME is  <uniqueid>-d.TestName.RandomTLD

   Whereby RandomTLD is a short TLD with the same properties as the
   candidate TLD. e.g.  if the CandidateTLD is U-Label then the
   RandomTLD is a U-Label from the same script.

   If the measurement servers receive queries where the QNAME is neither
   <uniqueid>-d.TestName.RandomTLD nor
   <uniqueid>-b.TestName.CandidateTLD then it is likely that all non-
   delegated domains are blocked.  An alternative way of interpreting
   this is that the queries where the QNAME is
   <uniqueid>-d.TestName.RandomTLD that arrive at the measurement
   servers provide a baseline for the transparency of the querying
   environment for non-delegated TLDs.

7.  Security Considerations

   The delegation of the Proposed TLD (CandidateTLD) and control TLD
   (TestName) comes with some risk of interference with existing
   deployments.  The risks for name collision for the TestName is under
   the control of the experimenter and can be minimized by taking random
   strings without semantic value.

   The risk of name collision with the CandidateTLD is minimized reduced
   by having the experiment's server returning RCODE=3. Under the
   assumption of regular DNS implementations that response is
   indistinguishable from a direct root-response for applications that
   receive such answer from a stub resolver.  The authors have no reason
   to believe that there are DNS implementations that would hand the
   applications a different response if a delegation is part of the
   resolution process.

   The authors would advise against signing the various delegated
   domains, as the introduction of DNSSEC is likely to bias the
   experiment.  At the root domain and ExistingTLDs, regular signing
   practices, including the inclusion of an NSEC or NSEC3 RR proving the
   non-existence of a DS record should continue.

   The experiment can be biased by 3rd parties through sending queries
   that have properties like the ones specified herein.  The
   experimentor SHOULD carefully control and record the <uniqueid>
   values used in the experiment and discard non-expected and non-unique
   queries that arrive at the nameserver.
