1. Introduction

   The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is a profile of the
   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), which can provide
   confidentiality, message authentication, and replay protection to the
   RTP traffic and to the control traffic for RTP, the Real-time
   Transport Control Protocol (RTCP).  It is important to note that the
   outgoing SRTP packets from a single endpoint may be originating from
   several independent data sources. 
 
   Authenticated encryption [BN00] is a form of encryption that, in
   addition to providing confidentiality for the plaintext that is
   encrypted, provides a way to check its integrity and authenticity. 
   Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data, or AEAD [R02], adds
   the ability to check the integrity and authenticity of some
   Associated Data (AD), also called "additional authenticated data",
   that is not encrypted.  This specification makes use of the interface
   to a generic AEAD algorithm as defined in [RFC5116]. 
 
   The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a block cipher that
   provides a high level of security, and can accept different key
   sizes.  Two families of AEAD algorithm families, AES Galois/Counter
   Mode (AES-GCM) and AES Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message
   Authentication Code (AES-CCM), are based upon AES.  This
   specification makes use of the AES versions that use 128-bit and
   256-bit keys, which we call AES-128 and AES-256, respectively. 
 
   The Galois/Counter Mode of operation (GCM) and the Counter with
   Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code mode of operation
   (CCM) are both AEAD modes of operation for block ciphers.  Both use
   counter mode to encrypt the data, an operation that can be
   efficiently pipelined.  Further, GCM authentication uses operations
   that are particularly well suited to efficient implementation in
   hardware, making it especially appealing for high-speed
   implementations, or for implementations in an efficient and compact
   circuit.  CCM is well suited for use in compact software
   implementations.  This specification uses GCM and CCM with both
   AES-128 and AES-256. 
 
   In summary, this document defines how to use AEAD algorithms,
   particularly AES-GCM and AES-CCM, to provide confidentiality and
   message authentication within SRTP and SRTCP packets.

3. Overview of the SRTP/SRTCP Security Architecture

   SRTP/SRTCP security is based upon the following principles:
 
       a)  Both privacy and authentication are based upon the use of
           symmetric algorithms.  An AEAD algorithm such as AES-CCM and
           AES-GCM combines privacy and authentication into a single
           process. 
 
       b)  A secret master key is shared by all participating endpoints,
           both those originating SRTP/SRTCP packets and those receiving
           these packets.  Any given master key MAY be used
           simultaneously by several endpoints to originate SRTP/SRTCP
           packets (as well one or more endpoints using this master key
           to process inbound data). 
 
       c)  A Key Derivation Function is applied to the shared master key
           value to form separate encryption keys, authentication keys
           and salting keys for SRTP and for SRTCP (a total of six
           keys).  This process is described in sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.3
           of [RFC3711].  Since AEAD algorithms such as AES-CCM and
           AES-GCM combine encryption and authentication into a single
           process, AEAD algorithms do not make use of the
           authentication keys.  The master key MUST be at least as
           large as the encryption key derived from it. 
 

4. Terminology

   The following terms have very specific meanings in the context of
   this RFC:
 
      Crypto Context  For the purposes of this document, a crypto
                      context is the outcome of any process which
                      results in authentication of each endpoint in the
                      SRTP session and possession by each endpoint of a
                      shared secret master key.  Various encryption
                      keys, authentication keys and salts are derived
                      from the master key.  Aside from making
                      modifications to IANA registries to allow AES-GCM
                      and AES-CCM to work with SDES, DTLS and MIKEY, the
                      details of how the master key is established are
                      outside the scope of this document.  Similarly any
                      mechanism for rekeying an existing Cipher Context
                      is outside the scope of the document. 
 
      Instantiation   In AEAD, an instantiation is an (Encryption_key,
                      salt) pair together with all of the data
                      structures (for example, counters) needed for it
                      to function properly.  In SRTP/SRTCP, each
                      endpoint will need two instantiations of the AEAD
                      algorithm for each master key in its possession,

                      one for SRTP and one for SRTCP. 
 
      Invocation      SRTP/SRTCP data streams are broken into packets. 
                      Each packet is processed by a single invocation of
                      the appropriate instantiation of the AEAD
                      algorithm. 
 
   In many applications, each endpoint will have one master key for
   processing outbound data but may have one or more separate master
   keys for processing inbound data. 
 

5. Generic AEAD Processing


5.1. Types of Input Data

     Associated Data        This is data that is to be authenticated but
                            not encrypted. 
 
     Plaintext              Data that is to be both encrypted and
                            authenticated. 
 
     Raw Data               Data that is to be neither encrypted nor
                            authenticated. 
 
   Which portions of SRTP/SRTCP packets that are to be treated as
   associated data, which are to be treated as plaintext, and which are
   to be treated as raw data are covered in sections 8.2, 9.2 and 9.3. 
 

5.2. AEAD Invocation Inputs and Outputs


5.2.1. Encrypt Mode

   
      Inputs:
        Encryption_key              Octet string, either 16 or 32
                                    octets long
        Initialization_Vector       Octet string, 12 octets long
        Associated_Data             Bit string of variable length
        Plaintext                   Bit string of variable length
        Tag_Size_Flag (CCM only*)   One Octet
   
      Outputs
        Ciphertext                  Bit string, length =
                                     length(ciphertext)-tag_length
   
     (*) For GCM, the algorithm choice determines the tag size.
   
   AES-CCM uses a Tag_Size_Flag that has the hex value 5A if an 8-octet

   authentication tag is used, 6A if a 12-octet authentication tag is
   used, and 7A if a 16-octet authentication tag is used. 
 

5.2.2. Decrypt Mode

   
      Inputs:
        Encryption_key              Octet string, either 16 or 32
                                    octets long
        Initialization_Vector       octet string, 12 octets long
        Associated_Data             Bit string of variable length
        Ciphertext                  Bit string of variable length
        Tag_Size_Flag (CCM only*)   One Octet
   
      Outputs
        Plaintext                   Bit string, length =
                                      length(ciphertext)-tag_length
        Validity_Flag               Boolean, TRUE if valid,
                                    FALSE otherwise
   
      (*) For GCM, the algorithm choice determines the tag size.
   
   AES-CCM uses a Tag_Size_Flag that has the hex value 5A if an 8-octet
   authentication tag is used, 6A if a 12-octet authentication tag is
   used, and 7A if a 16-octet authentication tag is used. 
 

5.3. Handling of AEAD Authentication

   AEAD requires that all incoming packets MUST pass AEAD authentication
   before any other action takes place.  The ciphertext MUST NOT be
   decrypted until the AEAD tag has been validated.  The associated data
   MUST NOT be released until the AEAD tag has been validated. 
 
   Should the AEAD tag prove to be invalid, the incoming data is to be
   discarded and appropriate error flags raised.  Local policy
   determines how these flags are to be handled and are outside the
   scope of this document. 
 

6. Counter Mode Encryption

   Each outbound packet uses a 12 octet IV and encryption key to form a
   keystream of bits which is XORed to the plaintext to form cipher. 
   Using the 12-octet IV and a 4-octet block counter, the keystream is
   formed in 16-octet blocks until it is at least as long as the
   plaintext, and any excess keystream bits are discarded.  At the start
   of each packet, the block counter is initialized to 0x0000 for
   AES-CCM and to 0x0001 for AES-GCM.  A key block is formed by
 
         key_block = AES_ENC( IV || block_counter; key=Encryption_key )


Igoe and McGrew                  Informational                  [Page 6]

Internet Draft         AES-GCM and AES-CCM for SRTP         Jun 25, 2012


 
   and the block counter is incremented.  This allows for a per packet
   keystream of length of up to 2^36 octets for AES-CCM and up to
   2^36-16 octets for AES-GCM. 
 
   With any counter mode, if the same (IV, Encryption_key) pair is used
   twice, precisely the same keystream is formed.  As explained in
   section 9.1 of RFC 3711, this is a cryptographic disaster.  For
   AES-GCM, the consequences of such a reuse are even worse than
   explained in RFC 3711 because it would completely compromise the
   AES-GCM authentication mechanism. 
 

7. Unneeded SRTP/SRTCP Fields

   AEAD counter mode encryption removes the need for certain existing
   SRTP/SRTCP mechanisms. 
 

7.1. SRTP/SRTCP Authentication Field

   The AEAD message authentication mechanism MUST be the primary message
   authentication mechanism for AEAD SRTP/SRTCP.  Additional SRTP/SRTCP
   authentication mechanisms SHOULD NOT be used with any AEAD algorithm
   and the optional SRTP/SRTCP Authentication Tags are NOT RECOMMENDED
   and SHOULD NOT be present.  Note that this contradicts section 3.4 of
   [RFC3711] which makes the use of the SRTCP Authentication field
   mandatory, but the presence of the AEAD authentication renders the
   older authentication methods redundant. 
 
      Rationale.  Some applications use the SRTP/SRTCP Authentication
      Tag as a means of conveying additional information, notably
      [RFC4771].  This document retains the Authentication Tag field
      primarily to preserve compatibility with these applications. 
 

7.2. RTP Padding

   Neither AES-GCM not AES-CCM requires that the data be padded out to a
   specific block size, reducing the need to ude the padding mechanism
   provided by RTP.  It is RECOMENDED that the RTP padding mechanism not
   be used unless it is necessary to disguise the length of the
   underlying plaintext. 
 

8. AES-GCM/CCM processing for SRTP


8.1. SRTP IV formation for AES-GCM and AES-CCM

   The 12 byte initialization vector used by both AES-GCM and AES-CCM
   SRTP is formed by first concatenating 2-octets of zeroes, the 4-octet

   SSRC, the 4-octer Rollover Counter (ROS) and the two octet sequence
   number SEQ.  The resulting 12-octet value is then XORed to the
   12-octet salt to form the 12-octet IV.

           Figure 1: AES-GCM and AES-CCM SRTP
                     Initialization Vector formation.

   Using the terminology of section 8.2.1.  of [GCM], the first six
   octets of the IV are the fixed field and the last six bytes are the
   invocation field. 
 

8.2. Data Types in SRTP Packets

   All SRTP packets MUST be both authenticated and encrypted.  The data
   fields within the SRTP packets are broken into Associated Data,
   Plaintext and Raw Data as follows (see figure 2):
 
     Associated Data  The version (2 bits), padding flag (1 bit),
                      extension flag (1 bit), CSRC count (4 bits),
                      sequence number (16 bits), timestamp (32 bits),
                      SSRC (32 bits), optional contributing source
                      identifiers (CSRCs, 32 bits each), and optional
                      RTP extension (32 bits). 
 
     Plaintext        The RTP payload (variable length), RTP padding (if
                      used, variable length), and RTP pad count ( if
                      used, 8 bits). 
 
     Raw Data         The optional 32-bit SRTP MKI and the 32-bit SRTP
                      authentication tag (whose use is NOT
                      RECOMMENDED).

8.3. Prevention of SRTP IV Reuse

   In order to prevent IV reuse, we must ensure that the (ROC,SEQ,SSRC)
   triple is never used twice with the same master key.  There are two
   phases to this issue. 
 
     Counter Management A rekey MUST be performed to establish a new
                        master key before the (ROC,SEQ) pair cycles back
                        to its original value. 
 
     SSRC Management    The set of all SSRC values must be partitioned
                        into disjoint pools, one pool for each endpoint
                        using the master key to originate outbound
                        data.  Each such endpoint MUST only issue SSRC
                        values from the pool it has been assigned. 
                        Further, each endpoint MUST maintain a history
                        of outbound SSRC identifiers that it has issued
                        within the lifetime of the current master key,
                        and when a new synchronization source requests

                        an SSRC identifier it MUST NOT be given an
                        identifier that has been previously issued.  A
                        rekey MUST be performed before its pool of SSRC
                        values is exhausted. 
 

9. AES-GCM/CCM Processing of SRTCP Compound Packets

   All SRTCP compound packets MUST be authenticated, but unlike SRTP,
   SRTCP packet encryption is optional.  A sender can select which
   packets to encrypt, and indicates this choice with a 1-bit encryption
   flag (located just before the 31-bit SRTCP index)
 

9.1. SRTCP IV formation for AES-GCM and AES-CCM

   The 12 byte initialization vector used by both AES-GCM and AES-CCM
   SRTCP is formed by first concatenating 2-octets of zeroes, the
   4-octet Synchronization Source identifier (SSRC), 2-octets of zeroes,
   a single zero bit, and the 31-bit SRTCP Index.  The resulting
   12-octet value is then XORed to the 12-octet salt to form the
   12-octet IV.

              Figure 3: SRTCP Initialization Vector formation.
   
   
   Using the terminology of section 8.2.1.  of [GCM], the first eight
   octets of the IV are the fixed field and the last four bytes are the
   invocation field. 
 

9.2. Data Types in Encrypted SRTCP Compound Packets

   When the encryption flag is set to 1, the SRTCP packet is broken into
   plaintext, associated data, and raw (untouched) data as listed below
   (see figure 4):
 
     Associated Data  The packet version (2 bits), padding flag (1 bit),
                      reception report count (5 bits), packet type (8

                      bits), length (2 octets), SSRC (4 octets),
                      encryption flag (1 bit) and SRTCP index (31
                      bits). 
 
     Raw Data         The 32-bit optional SRTCP MKI index and 32-bit
                      SRTCP authentication tag (whose use is NOT
                      RECOMMENDED). 
 
     Plaintext        All other data. 
 
   Note that the plaintext comes in one contiguous field.  Since the
   AEAD cipher is larger than the plaintext by exactly the length of the
   AEAD authentication tag, the corresponding STRCP encrypted packet
   replaces the plaintext field with a slightly larger field containing
   the cipher.

9.3. Data Types in Unencrypted SRTCP Compound Packets

   When the encryption flag is set to 0, the SRTCP compound packet is
   broken into plaintext, associated data, and raw (untouched) data as
   follows (see figure 5):
 
     Plaintext        None. 
 
     Raw Data         The 32-bit optional SRTCP MKI index and 32-bit
                      SRTCP authentication tag (whose use is NOT
                      RECOMMENDED). 
 
     Associated Data  All other data. 
 
   Even though there is no plaintext in this RTCP packet, AEAD
   encryption returns a cipher field which is precisely the length of
   the AEAD authentication tag.  This cipher is to be placed before the
   Encryption flag and the SRTCP index in the authenticated SRTCP
   packet.

9.4. Prevention of SRTCP IV Reuse

   A new master key MUST be established before the 31-bit SRTCP index
   cycles back to its original value.  Ideally a rekey performed should
   be performed and a new master key in place and well before the SRTCP
   index overflows. 
 
   The comments on SSRC management in section 8.3 also apply. 
 

10. Constraints on AEAD for SRTP and SRTCP

   In general, any AEAD algorithm can accept inputs with varying
   lengths, but each algorithm can accept only a limited range of
   lengths for a specific parameter.  In this section, we describe the
   constraints on the parameter lengths that any AEAD algorithm must
   support to be used in AEAD-SRTP.  Additionally we specify a complete
   parameter set for two specific AEAD algorithms, namely AES-GCM and
   AES-CCM. 
 

10.1. Generic AEAD Parameter Constraints

   All AEAD algorithms used with SRTP/SRTCP MUST satisfy the three
   constraints listed below:
 
      PARAMETER  Meaning                  Value
      
      A_MAX      maximum additional       MUST be at least 12 octets
                 authenticated data
                 length
      N_MIN      minimum nonce (IV)       MUST be no more than 12 octets
                 length
      N_MAX      maximum nonce (IV)       MUST be at least 12 octets
                 length
      C_MAX      maximum ciphertext       MUST be at most 2^36-16 octets
                 length per invocation    C_max values less than 2232
                                          are discouraged
      
   The upper bound on C_MAX are based on purely cryptographic
   considerations.  The lower bound on C_MAX is obtained by subtracting
   away a 20-octet IP header, 8-octet UDP header, and 12-octet RTP
   header from the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of 2272. 
 
   For sake of clarity we specify two additional parameters:
 
      Authentication Tag Length         MUST be either 8, 12, or 16
                                             octets
      Maximum number of invocations     MUST be at most 2^48 for SRTP

Internet Draft         AES-GCM and AES-CCM for SRTP         Jun 25, 2012


         for a given instantiation      MUST be at most 2^31 for SRTCP
      Block Counter size                MUST be 32 bits
      
   The reader is reminded that the plaintext is shorter than the
   ciphertext by exactly the length of the AEAD authentication tag. 
 

10.2. AES-GCM for SRTP/SRTCP

   AES-GCM is a family of AEAD algorithms built around the AES block
   cipher algorithm.  AES-GCM uses AES counter mode for encryption and
   Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC) for authentication.  A
   detailed description of the AES-GCM family can be found in
   [RFC5116].  The following members of the AES-GCM family may be used
   with SRTP/SRTCP:
 
             Table 1: AES-GCM algorithms for SRTP/SRTCP
      Name                 Key Size      Auth. Tag Size     Reference
      ================================================================
      AEAD_AES_128_GCM     16 octets     16 octets          [RFC5116]
      AEAD_AES_256_GCM     32 octets     16 octets          [RFC5116]
      AEAD_AES_128_GCM_8   16 octets     8 octets           [RFC5282]
      AEAD_AES_256_GCM_8   32 octets     8 octets           [RFC5282]
      AEAD_AES_128_GCM_12  16 octets     12 octets          [RFC5282]
      AEAD_AES_256_GCM_12  32 octets     12 octets          [RFC5282]
      
   Any implementation of AES-GCM SRTP SHOULD support both
   AEAD_AES_128_GCM_8 and AEAD_AES_256_GCM_8, and it MAY support the
   four other variants shown table 1. 
 

10.3. AES-CCM for SRTP/SRTCP

   AES-CCM is another family of AEAD algorithms built around the AES
   block cipher algorithm.  AES-CCM uses AES counter mode for encryption
   and AES Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC MAC)
   for authentication.  A detailed description of the AES-CCM family can
   be found in [RFC5116].  The following members of the AES-CCM family
   may be used with SRTP/SRTCP:

   AEAD_AES_256_CCM     32 octets   8, 12 or 16 octets   [RFC5116]
   
   Any implementation of AES-CCM SRTP/SRTCP SHOULD support both
   AEAD_AES_128_CCM and AEAD_AES_256_CCM. 
 
   AES-CCM uses a flag octet that conveys information about the length
   of the authentication tag, length of the block counter, and presence
   of additional authenticated data.  For AES-CCM in SRTP/SRTCP, the

   flag octet has the hex value 5A if an 8-octet authentication tag is
   used, 6A if a 12-octet authentication tag is used, and 7A if a
   16-octet authentication tag is used.  The flag octet is one of the
   inputs to AES during the counter mode encryption of the plaintext. 
 

11. Key Derivation Functions

   A Key Derivation Function (KDF) is used to derive all of the required
   encryption and authentication keys from a secret value shared by the
   endpoints.  Both the AEAD_AES_128_GCM algorithms and the
   AEAD_AES_128_CCM algorithms MUST use the (128-bit) AES_CM_PRF Key
   Derivation Function described in [RFC3711].  Both the
   AEAD_AES_256_GCM algorithms and the AEAD_AES_256_CCM algorithms MUST
   use the AES_256_CM_PRF Key Derivation Function described in [RFC
   6188]. 
 

12. Security Considerations


12.1. Handling of Security Critical Parameters

   As with any security process, the implementer must take care to
   ensure cryptographically sensitive parameters are properly handled. 
   Many of these recommendations hold for all SRTP cryptographic
   algorithms, but we include them here to emphasize their importance. 
 
      - If the master salt is to be kept secret, it MUST be properly
        erased when no longer needed. 
      - The secret master key and all keys derived from it MUST be kept
        secret.  All keys MUST be properly erased when no longer
        needed. 
      - At the start of each packet, the block counter MUST be reset (to
        0 for CCM, to 1 for GCM).  The block counter is incremented
        after each block key has been produced, but it MUST NOT be
        allowed to exceed 2^32-1. 
      - Each time a rekey occurs, the initial values of the SRTCP index
        and the values of all the SEQ counters MUST be saved. 
      - Processing MUST cease if the 48-bit Packet Counter or the 31-bit
        SRTCP index cycles back to its initial value.  Processing MUST
        NOT resume until a new SRTP/SRTCP session has been established
        using a new SRTP master key.  Ideally, a rekey should be done
        well before either of these counters cycle. 
 

12.2. Size of the Authentication Tag

   We require that the AEAD authentication tag must be at least 8
   octets, significantly reducing the probability of an adversary
   successfully introducing fraudulent data.  The goal of an
   authentication tag is to minimize the probability of a successful

Internet Draft         AES-GCM and AES-CCM for SRTP         Jun 25, 2012


   forgery occurring anywhere in the network we are attempting to
   defend.  There are three relevant factors: how low we wish the
   probability of successful forgery to be (prob_success), how many
   attempts the adversary can make (N_tries) and the size of the
   authentication tag in bits (N_tag_bits).  Then
 
           prob_success < expected number of successes
                        = N_tries * 2^-N_tag_bits.
   Suppose an adversary wishes to introduce a forged or altered packet
   into a target network by randomly selecting an authentication value
   until by chance they hit a valid authentication tag.  The table below
   summarizes the relationship between the number of forged packets the
   adversary has tried, the size of the authentication tag, and the
   probability of a compromise occurring (i.e.  at least one of the
   attempted forgeries having a valid authentication tag).  The reader
   is reminded that the forgery attempts can be made over the entire
   network, not just a single link, and that frequently changing the key
   does not decrease the probability of a compromise occurring.

13. IANA Considerations


13.1. SDES

   Security description [RFC 4568] defines SRTP "crypto suites"; a
   crypto suite corresponds to a particular AEAD algorithm in SRTP.  In
   order to allow SDP to signal the use of the algorithms defined in
   this document, IANA will register the following crypto suites into
   the subregistry for SRTP crypto suites under the SRTP transport of
   the SDP Security Descriptions:

13.2. DTLS

   DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] defines a DTLS-SRTP "SRTP Protection Profile"; it
   also corresponds to the use of an AEAD algorithm in SRTP.  In order
   to allow the use of the algorithms defined in this document in
   DTLS-SRTP, we request IANA register the following SRTP Protection

   these profiles use AEAD algorithms, and thus do not use a separate

13.3. MIKEY

   In accordance with "MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing" [RFC3830],
   IANA maintains several Payload Name Spaces under Multimedia Internet
   KEYing (MIKEY).  This document requires dditions to two of the lists
   maintained under MIKEY Security Protocol Parameters. 
 
   On the SRTP policy Type/Value list (derived from Table 6.10.1.a of
   [RFC3830]) we request the following addition:
 
      Type | Meaning                         | Possible values
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
       TBD | AEAD authentication tag length  | 8, 12, or 16 (in octets)
      
      
   On the Encryption Algorithm List (derived from Table 6.10.1.b of
   [RFC3830]) we request the following additions:
 
       SRTP encr alg. | Value | Default Session Encr. Key Length
       -----------------------------------------------------------
         AES-CCM       |  TBD  |        16 octets
         AES-GCM       |  TBD  |        16 octets
      
   The SRTP encryption algorithm, session encryption key length, and
   AEAD authentication tag values received from MIKEY fully determine
   the AEAD algorithm (e.g., AEAD_AES_256_GCM_8).  The exact mapping is
   described in section 14. 
 

14. Parameters for use with MIKEY

   MIKEY specifies the algorithm family separately from the key length
   (which is specified by the Session Encryption key length ) and the
   authentication tag length (specified by AEAD Auth.  tag length).

             Table 4: Mapping MIKEY parameters to AEAD algorithm
     
     
   Section 11 in this document restricts the choice of Key Derivation
   Function for AEAD algorithms.  To enforce this restriction in MIKEY,
   we require that the SRTP PRF has value AES-CM whenever an AEAD
   algorithm is used.  Note that, according to Section 6.10.1 in
   [RFC3830], the key length of the Key Derivation Function (i.e.  the
   SRTP master key length) is always equal to the session encryption key
   length.  This means, for example, that AEAD_AES_256_GCM will use
   AES_256_CM_PRF as the Key Derivation Function.
