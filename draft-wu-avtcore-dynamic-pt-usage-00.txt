         Guideline for dynamic payload type number usage policy
                  draft-wu-avtcore-dynamic-pt-usage-00

Abstract

   The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control
   (RTP/AVP) is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure
   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for
   Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/
   AVPF), and the Extended Secure RTP Profile for RTCP-Based Feedback
   (RTP/SAVPF).  This document updates RFC 3551 and provide guidelines
   for payload type number usage policy.

1.  Introduction

   The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control
   (RTP/AVP) [RFC3551] is the basis for many other profiles, such as the
   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP
   Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based
   Feedback (RTP/ AVPF), and the Extended Secure RTP Profile for RTCP-
   Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF).  RTP Payload type can have the values 0
   to 127.  The binding of RTP payload format to Payload type can be
   static or dynamic.  [RFC3551] establishes the policy that no
   additional static payload types will be assigned beyond the ones
   defined.  As described in RFC5761 [RFC5761], dynamic RTP payload
   types SHOULD be chosen first from the range 96-127.  Values below 64
   MAY be used if that is insufficient.

   However some implementations may still exhaust the dynamic payload
   type numbering space before re-using a payload type within the scope
   of a local transport address.  This document updates RFC 3551 and
   provide guidelines for payload type number usage policy.

3.  Update to RFC3551

   Section 3 of " RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with
   Minimal Control " [RFC3551] states:

   "
   This association is effective only for the duration of the RTP
   session in which the dynamic payload type binding is made.
   This association applies only to the RTP session for which
   it is made, thus the numbers can be re-used for different
   encodings in different sessions so the number space
   limitation is avoided.

   This document changes the quoted text as follows:

   "
   This association is effective only for the duration of the RTP
   session in which the dynamic payload type binding is made.
   This association applies only to the RTP session for which
   it is made, thus the numbers can be re-used for different
   encodings in different sessions. Support for multiple RTP
   streams in a single session which is recommended in order
   to reduce the number of open transport connections can
   exhaust the payload type space.
   "


4.  Use of Dynamic payload type

   As described in section 3 of RFC3551 [RFC3551], the payload type
   number space is relatively small and cannot accommodate assignments
   for all existing and future encodings.  The registry for RTP Payload
   types (PT) for standard audio and video encodings [http://
   www.iana.org/assignments/rtp-parameters/rtp-parameters.xhtml#rtp-
   parameters-1] is closed.  New payload formats(e.g.,H.264,VP8) MUST
   use dynamic payload type number assignment.  Each payload format is
   named by a registered media subtype.  The "encoding name" is also
   registered as a media subtype under the media type "audio" or
   "video".

   When these dynamic payload type are used, SDP [RFC4566] or other
   protocols such as ITU-T Recommendation H.323/H.245[H323] [H245] be
   used to establish dynamic mapping between a payload type and an
   encoding.

   Applications SHOULD first use values in the range for dynamic payload
   types [96-127].  Those applications which need to define more than 32
   dynamic payload types MAY bind codes below 96, in which case it is
   RECOMMENDED that unassigned payload type numbers [35-63] followed by
   [20-24], 27, [29-30].  If more payload type numbers are needed the
   application may use the reserved values 1,2,19 see [RFC3551] and 64,

   65 see [RFC5761] If more Payload type numbers are needed then mapping
   to the defined static payload type may be used [0, 3-18,25,26,28] but
   may cause problems for applications that may assume a specific
   payload format based on the Payload Type ignoring the mapping in the
   signaling.

      Editor note: do we want to recommend re-use of payload type in
      bundled m-lines if they map to the same payload format here?

5.  Security Considerations

   This document modifies the IANA allocation of RTP Payload Types in
   relationship to RFC 3551.  This policy change itself does not add
   security concerns to the ones in [RFC3551] and [RFC5761].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This section describes changes to the IANA Considerations sections
   outlined in RFC 3551 regarding the allocation of payload type number
   by IANA.

   Add to the note in http://www.iana.org/assignments/rtp-parameters/
   rtp-parameters.xhtml the following text "Policy for mapping of
   dynamic payload type numbers to payload format is defined in RFCxxxx
   [this document].

7.  Acknowledgements

   The content of this document is the result of the work in the IETF
   Audio/Video Transport Core Maintenance (AVTCORE) working group.  We
   would therefore like to thank all the working group members who were
   involved in that discussion.  While it appears to be a fairly small
   change in the usage policy and allocation policy, the effect on
   implementations is rather dramatic.
