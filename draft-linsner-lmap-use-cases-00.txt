              Large-Scale Broadband Measurement Use Cases 
                    draft-linsner-lmap-use-cases-00


Abstract

   Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important for   
   network diagnostics by providers and users, as well for as public   
   policy.  To conduct such measurements, user networks gather data,   
   either on their own initiative or instructed by a measurement   
   controller, and then upload the measurement results to a designated  
   measurement server.  Understanding the various scenarios and users of
   measuring broadband performance is essential to development of the
   system requirements.  The details of the measurement metrics
   themselves are beyond the scope of this document.

INTERNET DRAFT               LMAP Use Cases            December 21, 2012


1  Introduction

   Large-scale measurement efforts in [LMAP-REQ] describe three use
   cases to be considered in deriving the requirements to be used in
   developing the solution.  This documents attempts to describe those
   use cases in further detail and include addtional use cases.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Use Cases

   The first 3 use cases are copied directly from [LMAP-REQ], then
   changes made attempting to correlate with list discussions.

2.1 Access Network Provider

   Internet service providers have an interest in knowing how well their
   networks are performing, as viewed from their customers' perspective.
   Such performance information allows them to identify bottlenecks and
   observe the impact of changes in user behavior, e.g., the emergence
   of new network applications or time-of-day patterns.  Here, the
   provider is not interested in the performance of an individual edge
   network or device, but rather wants to get a statistically-valid
   sample of performance across their network.  Service providers may be
   interested in both the end device performance, i.e., the performance
   as seen by edge devices in home and enterprise networks, as well as
   the edge performance, i.e., as seen by the network device directly
   attached to their network, such as a cable modem, DSL modem or
   enterprise edge router.  To reduce the network load, providers are
   unlikely to gather measurements from all clients all the time, but
   rather sample randomly across both time and their user population.

2.2 End User Network Diagnostics

   End users may want to determine whether their network is performing
   according to the specifications (e.g., service level agreements)
   offered by their Internet service provider, or they may want to
   diagnose whether components of their network path are impaired.  End
   users may perform measurements on their own, using the measurement
   infrastructure they provide or infrastructure offered by a third
   party, or they may work directly with their network or application
   provider to diagnose a specific performance problem.  Depending on
   the circumstances, measurements may occur at specific pre-defined

   intervals, or may be triggered manually.  A system administrator may
   perform such measurements on behalf of the user.

2.3 Multi-provider Network Measurements

   As an extension of the first use case, multiple network providers and
   third parties, such as a regulatory body, may collaborate to gather
   network performance data on a one-time or recurring basis, using a
   subset of customers of the service providers.  The form of
   collaboration is beyond the scope of this paper, however it should be
   understood that a data collection platform must serve multiple
   stakeholder interests.

   The main consumer of this use case is someone other than the 'last
   mile' provider.

2.4 Over the Top Providers

   Possibly an extension to the Multi-Provider use case, OTT providers
   have an interest to ensure Quality of Experience (QOE) associated
   with content consumption.  The uniqueness to this use case compared
   to those mentioned above is the feature that the measurement client
   will run on software based apps and embedded apps such as those found
   in set-top boxes or disc players.  It is assumed that measurement
   tests run by OTT providers would only include the metrics associated
   with layer 3 and up.

   The main consumer of this use case are content providers.
