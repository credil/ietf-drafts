         Via header field parameter to indicate received realm
              draft-holmberg-sipcore-received-realm-00.txt

Abstract

   This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   Via header field parameter, "received-realm", which allows a SIP
   entity acting as an entry point to a transit network to indicate from
   which adjacent upstream network a SIP request is received, using a
   network realm value associated with the adjacent network.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  General

   When SIP sessions are established between networks belonging to
   different operators, or between interconnected networks belonging to
   the same operator (or enterprise), the SIP requests might traverse
   transit network.

   Such transit networks might provide different kind of services.  In
   order to do that, a transit network often needs to know to which
   operator (or enterprise) the adjacent upstream network, from which
   the SIP session initiation request is received, belongs.

   This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   Via header field parameter, "received-realm", which allows a SIP
   entity acting as an entry point to a transit network to indicate from
   which adjacent upstream network a SIP request is received, using a
   network realm value associated with the adjacent network.

   NOTE: As the adjacent network can be an enterprise network, an Inter
   Operator Identifier (IOI) cannot be used to identity the network, as
   IOIs are not defined for enterprise networks.

   The following sections describe use-case where the information is
   needed.

1.2.  Use-Case: Transit Network Application Services

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) TS 23.228 [3GPP.23.228]
   specifies how an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) network can be used to
   provide transit funtionality.  An operator can use its IMS network to
   provide transit functionality e.g. to non-IMS customers, to
   enterprise networks, and to other network operators.

   The transit network operator can provide application services to the
   networks for which it is providing transit functionality.  Transit
   application services are typically not provided per user basis, as
   the transit network does not have access to the user profiles of the
   networks for which the application services are provided.  Instead,
   the application services are provided per served network.

   When a SIP entity that provides application services (e.g. an
   Application Server) within a transit network receives a SIP request,
   in order to apply the correct services it needs to know the adjacent
   upstream network from which the SIP request is received.

1.3.  Use-Case: Transit Network Routing

   A transit network operator normally interconnects to many diferent
   operators, including other transit network operators, and provides
   transit routing of SIP requests received from one operator network
   towards the destination.  The destination can be within an operator
   network to which the transit network operator has a direct
   interconnect, or within an operator network that only can be reached
   via one or more interconnected transit operators.

   For each customer, i.e. interconnected network operator for which,
   the transit network operator routes SIP requests towards the
   requested destination a set of transit routing polices are defined.
   These policies are used to determine how a SIP request shall be
   routed towards the requested destination to meet the agreement the
   transit network operator has with its customer.

   When a SIP entity that performs the transit routing functionality
   receives a SIP request, in order to apply the correct set of transit
   routing policies, it needs to know from which of its customers, i.e.
   adjacent upstream network, the SIP request is received.


2.  Applicability

   The mechanism defined in this specification MUST only be used by SIP
   entities that are able to verify from which adjacent upstream network
   a SIP request is received.

   The mechanism for verifying from which adjacent upstream network a
   SIP request is received is outside the scope of this specification.


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


4.  Definitions

   SIP entity: SIP User Agent (UA), or SIP proxy, as defined in RFC
   3261.

   Adjacent upstream SIP network: The adjacent SIP network in the
   direction from which a SIP request is received.

   Network entry point: A SIP entity on the border of network, which
   recieves SIP requests from adjacent upstream networks.

   Inter Operator Identifier (IOI): A globally unique identifier to
   correlate billing information generated within the IP Multimedia
   Subsystem (IMS).


5.  User Agent and Proxy behavior

5.1.  General

   This section describes how a SIP entity, acting as an entry point to
   a network, uses the "received-realm" Via header field parameter.

5.2.  Behavior of a SIP entity acting as a network entry point

   When a SIP entity, acting as a network entry point, forwards a SIP
   request, or initiates a SIP request on its own (e.g. a PSTN gateway),
   the SIP entity adds a Via header field to the SIP request, according
   to the procedures in RFC 3261 [RFC3261].  In addition, if the SIP
   entity is able to assert the adjacent upstream network, and if the
   SIP entity is aware of a network realm value defined for that
   network, the SIP entity can add a "received-realm" Via header field
   parameter, conveying the network realm value, to the Via header field
   added to the SIP request.
