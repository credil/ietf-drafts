     OSPF Extensions for Link State Database Synchronization Group
                   draft-ylz-ospf-lsdb-sync-group-00

Abstract

   This document describes a special scheme of OSPF Database
   synchronization by dividing OSPF Routers into different groups and
   preventing OSPF Routers from different groups to synchronize, this
   scheme can help to enhance the number of OSPF adjacencies and the
   capability of deploying OSPF on large network.

Internet-Draft               OSPF SYNC GROUP               February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The OSPF routing protocol has been used more and more widely in IP
   radio access networks and enterprise networks.  The routers in these
   networks are usually small devices which have limited memory and CPU,
   and can not be deployed on large network or large number of
   adjacencies.  This document describes a new mechanism for improving
   this issue.


2.  Terminology

   Synchronization Group: Subset of one area in which the OSPF Routers
   can exchange LSAs with each other.  The OSPF Routers from different
   Synchronization Groups MUST NOT exchange LSAs with each other.

   Synchronization Group ID: Identity of Synchronization Group.

   Group Member: One role of OSPF in Synchronization Group which has a
   unique Synchronization Group ID carried in its LSA.  Only those
   members who are carrying the same Synchronization Group ID SHOULD
   establish adjacency.  Otherwise no adjacency SHOULD be established.
   The interface of Group Member is called Group Member interface.

   Group Master: One role of OSPF in Synchronization Group which should
   establish adjacencies with any other OSPF Routers ignoring Group IDs.
   The interface of Group Master is called Group Master interface.


3.  Requirement

   The OSPF routing protocol [RFC2328]has an mechanism to make sure the
   LSA database to synchronize.  If the LSA database is not
   synchronized, There may be loop of routes or black hole of routes.
   One OSPF in network must exchange link status information with its
   adjacencies.  In some scenarios that there are thousands of LSAs and
   more than one thousand adjacencies in the network, lots of LSAs need
   to be transferred on so many adjacencies for synchronization.  The
   physical device resource including memory/CPU/ line card is the
   critical factor to extend the size of network.

3.1.  Hub and Spoke Scenario

           /   | : |   \
          p1    ...    pn

      Figure 1 Hub and Spoke Network

   Suppose Hub A establish n adjacencies and there are m LSAs in the
   network.  Hub A will transfer (including receiving and sending) these
   LSAs on its n interfaces.  The total LSAs to transfer is O(n*m)
   without considering the number of LSAs which need to be
   retransmitted.  The time to synchronize LSAs to n adjacencies for Hub
   A is critical for route convergence.  Hub A need support high
   performance of transferring packets.  In some scenarios, hub and
   spoke devices are poor hardware condition with limited memory and
   CPU, especially the spoke devices can not store all LSAs in the
   network because of less memory.  In such case, there are some special
   requirements:

   1) The spoke devices are not necessary to learn routes with each
   other.

   2) The spoke devices learn default route or gate way route from hub
   device.


4.  Solution

   This document introduces a new mechanism which supports LSAs to
   synchronize in part of one area.

4.1.  Synchronization Group

   One area is divided into several parts called Synchronization Groups
   which are identified by unique ID (Synchronization Group ID).

   Two roles of OSPF Routers are defined here: Group Member OSPF Router
   and Group Master OSPF Router.

   Group Member OSPF Routers from the same Synchronization Group SHOULD
   establish adjacencies and exchange LSAs;

   Group Member OSPF Routers from different Synchronization Group MUST
   NOT establish adjacencies and MUST NOT exchange LSAs with each other.

   The interface of Group Member OSPF Router is defined as Group Member
   Interface; The interface of Group Master OSPF Router is defined as

Internet-Draft               OSPF SYNC GROUP               February 2013


   Group Master Interface.

4.2.  Synchronization Group Adjacency

   The procedure of establishing Synchronization Group Adjacency:

   1) A new TLV called Synchronization Group sub-TLV (see section 5) can
   be carried in Router Information Opaque LSA [RFC4970]and Link-Local
   Signaling (LLS for short) [RFC4813].  Group Member Interface sends
   Router Information Opaque LSA including Synchronization Group TLV
   with its related Synchronization Group ID and M bit set to 0; Group
   Master Interface sends Router Information Opaque LSA including
   Synchronization Group TLV with its Synchronization Group ID set to 0
   and M bit set to 1.  (Note: Group Member Routers/Interface SHOULD set
   Synchronization Group ID as configured value which is not 0.  Group
   Master Routers/Interface SHOULD set Synchronization Group ID as 0.)

   2) For Group Member whose Synchronization Group ID is not 0,

   a) If Group Member OSPF Router has one or more neighbors of Group
   Member, none of them don't support Synchronization Group feature,
   they MUST NOT form normal adjacency/adjacencies.

   b) If Group Member OSPF Router has one or more neighbors of Group
   Member which have the same Synchronization Group ID, they SHOULD form
   Synchronization Group adjacency/adjacencies; otherwise, they MUST NOT
   form normal adjacency/adjacencies.

   3) For Group Master OSPF Router of which Synchronization Group ID is
   0,

   a) If Group Master OSPF Router has one or more neighbors of OSPF
   Routers, but none of them supports Synchronization Group feature,
   then they can form normal adjacency/adjacencies.

   b) If Group Master OSPF Router has one or more neighbors of Group
   Member OSPF Routers which have the same Synchronization Group ID,
   they can form Synchronization Group adjacency/adjacencies.  If some
   neighbors have different Synchronization Group IDs, they MUST NOT
   form normal adjacency/adjacencies.

   c) If Group Master OSPF Router has more than one neighbor of OSPF
   Routers and some of them support Synchronization Group feature while
   others don't, then they MUST NOT form normal adjacency/adjacencies.

   d) Group Master OSPF Routers SHOULD form normal adjacencies with each
   other on the LAN where no Group Member OSPF exists.

   e) If a common LAN is shared by two or more Group Master OSPF Routers
   and some Group Member OSPF Routers whose Synchronization Group ID are
   the same, they can form Synchronization Group adjacency/adjacencies.

   f) If a common LAN is shared by two or more Group Master OSPF Routers
   and some Group Member OSPF Routers whose Synchronization Group ID are
   not the same, they MUST NOT form adjacency/adjacencies.

   Synchronization Group Adjacency SHOULD be advertised as normal
   adjacency.

4.3.  LSA Synchronization by Group

   Group Member OSPF MUST carry Synchronization Group TLV (see section
   5) in Router Information Opaque LSA and LLS.  Group Member OSPF
   Router just holds the LSAs which are generated by OSPF Routers which
   in the same Synchronization Group, or by Group Master OSPF Routers,
   or by OSPF Routers which don't support Synchronization Group feature.

   The procedure of SNP packets:

   1) Group Member Interface and Group Master Interface which has
   Synchronization Group Adjacency SHOULD send/receive special LSA
   packets which just contain the entries of the same group and non-
   group LSAs.

   2) When Group Member Interface receives some LSAs from packet which
   is not belong the same group,

   a) If the LSA entry with non-maxage, the LSA entry SHOULD be discard.

   b) If the LSA entry with maxage, the LSA entry SHOULD be processed as
   described in OSPF [RFC2328].

   The procedure of LSA, When Group Member OSPF A receives OSPF B's LSA
   x:

   1) if x is maxage LSA, A SHOULD synchronize LSA x to adjacencies of
   Group Member. maxage LSA SHOULD be synchronized as described in OSPF
   [RFC2328].

   2) if x is not maxage LSA and A does not receive the Synchronization
   Group sub-TLV of Router Information Opaque LSA of B before, LSA x
   cannot make sure which group it belongs, so LSA x SHOULD not be sent
   to adjacencies of Group Member.

   3) if x is not maxage LSA and A has received the Router Information
   Opaque LSA of B,

Internet-Draft               OSPF SYNC GROUP               February 2013


   a) If B does not support Synchronization Group feature, LSA x SHOULD
   be synchronized to all adjacencies of A.

   b) If B supports Synchronization Group feature and has the same
   Synchronization Group ID, LSA x SHOULD be synchronized to all
   adjacencies of A; otherwise, LSA x SHOULD NOT be sent to adjacencies
   of Group Member.

4.4.  Route Calculation

   OSPF calculates routes based on its LSA database.  No change in this
   document.

4.5.  Change of Group Member's Group ID

   When a Group Member OSPF wants to change its group ID to another one,
   it is RECOMMENDED to change system ID of OSPF for a new one at the
   same time.  Group member will generate new LSAs and be synchronized
   in new group.  The old LSAs will remain in the old group, but it will
   not be used in route calculation.  The remain life of the old LSAs
   will be reduced until reach Maxage to flush.


5.  Protocol Extension

   A new TLV called Synchronization Group TLV is defined to be included
   in Router Information Opaque LSA.  The Opaque LSA transmitted by a
   interface that belongs to one Synchronization Group MUST include this
   TLV.

   MUST NOT be 0.

   Sub-TLV is not defined in this document which could be extended in
   future.


6.  Protocol Process

   Synchronization Group TLV is introduced to indicate whether support
   Synchronization Group feature or not.

6.1.  Sending

   Synchronization Group TLV MUST be carried in the Router Information
   Opaque LSA and MUST encode once in LSA; This TLV is optional to carry
   for Group Master OSPF Router.

   Group Member Interface MUST carry this TLV in its Router Information
   Opaque LSA with its related Synchronization Group ID and M bit set to
   0;

   Group Master Interface sends Router Information Opaque LSA including
   synchronization Group TLV with its Synchronization Group ID set to 0
   and M bit set to 1.

6.2.  Receiving

   If there are more than one Synchronization Group TLVs in Router
   Information Opaque LSA, the first one is selected, others are
   ignored.

   if Synchronization Group ID and M bit are both set to 0 in TLV, the
   TLV is illegal and SHOULD be ignored.

   the TLV is illegal and SHOULD be ignored.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA allocate from the OSPF TLV
   Codepoints Registry a new TLV, referred to as the "Synchronization
   Group" TLV
