1.  Introduction

   This memo specifies the CDNI Logging interface between a downstream
   CDN (dCDN) and an upstream CDN (uCDN).  First, it describes a
   reference model for CDNI logging.  Then, it specifies the CDNI
   Logging File format and the actual protocol for exchange of CDNI
   Logging Files.

   The reader should be familiar with the following documents:

   o  CDNI problem statement [RFC6707] and framework
      [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework] identify a Logging interface,

   o  Section 8 of [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements] specifies a set of
      requirements for Logging,

   o  [RFC6770] outlines real world use-cases for interconnecting CDNs.
      These use cases require the exchange of Logging information
      between the dCDN and the uCDN.

   As stated in [RFC6707], "the CDNI Logging interface enables details
   of logs or events to be exchanged between interconnected CDNs".

   The present document describes:

   o  The CDNI Logging reference model (Section 2),

   o  The CDNI Logging File format (Section 3),

   o  The CDNI Logging File Exchange protocol (Section 4).

1.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the first letter of each CDNI-specific term is
   capitalized.  We adopt the terminology described in [RFC6707] and
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework], and extend it with the additional terms
   defined below.

   For clarity, we use the word "Log" only for referring to internal CDN
   logs and we use the word "Logging" for any inter-CDN information
   exchange and processing operations related to CDNI Logging interface.
   Log and Logging formats may be different.

   CDN Logging information: logging information generated and collected
   within a CDN

   CDNI Logging information: logging information exchanged across CDNs
   using the CDNI Logging Interface

   Logging information: logging information generated and collected
   within a CDN or obtained from another CDN using the CDNI Logging
   Interface

   CDNI Logging Field: an atomic element of information that can be
   included in a CDNI Logging Record.  The time an event/task started,
   the IP address of an End user to whom content was delivered, and the
   URI of the content delivered are examples of CDNI Logging Fields.

   CDNI Logging Record: an information record providing information
   about a specific event.  This comprises a collection of CDNI Logging
   Fields.

   CDNI Logging File: a file containing CDNI Logging Records, as well as
   additional information facilitating the processing of the CDNI
   Logging Records.

   CDN Reporting: the process of providing the relevant information that
   will be used to create a formatted content delivery report provided
   to the CSP in deferred time.  Such information typically includes
   aggregated data that can cover a large period of time (e.g., from
   hours to several months).  Uses of Reporting include the collection
   of charging data related to CDN services and the computation of Key
   Performance Indicators (KPIs).

   CDN Monitoring: the process of providing content delivery information
   in real-time.  Monitoring typically includes data in real time to
   provide visibility of the deliveries in progress, for service
   operation purposes.  It presents a view of the global health of the
   services as well as information on usage and performance, for network
   services supervision and operation management.  In particular,
   monitoring data can be used to generate alarms.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  CDNI Logging Reference Model

2.1.  CDNI Logging interactions

   The CDNI logging reference model between a given uCDN and a given
   dCDN involves the following interactions:

   o  customization by the uCDN of the CDNI logging information to be
      provided by the dCDN to the uCDN (e.g. control of which logging
      fields are to be communicated to the uCDN for a given task
      performed by the dCDN, control of which types of events are to be
      logged).  The dCDN takes into account this CDNI logging
      customization information to determine what logging information to
      provide to the uCDN, but it may, or may not, take into account
      this CDNI logging customization information to influence what CDN
      logging information is to be generated and collected within the
      dCDN (e.g. even if the uCDN requests a restricted subset of the
      logging information, the dCDN may elect to generate a broader set
      of logging information).  The mechanism to support the
      customisation by the uCDN of CDNI Logging information is outside
      the scope of this document and left for further study.  We note
      that the CDNI Control interface or the CDNI Metadata interface
      appear as candidate interfaces on which to potentially build such
      a customisation mechanism in the future.  Before such a mechanism
      is available, the uCDN and dCDN are expected to agree off-line on
      what CDNI logging information is to be provide by dCDN to UCDN and
      rely on management plane actions to configure the CDNI Logging
      functions to generate (respectively, expect) in dCDN
      (respectively, in uCDN).

   o  generation and collection by the dCDN of logging information
      related to the completion of any task performed by the dCDN on
      behalf of the uCDN (e.g., delivery of the content to an end user)
      or related to events happening in the dCDN that are relevant to
      the uCDN (e.g., failures or unavailability in dCDN).  This takes
      place within the dCDN and does not directly involve CDNI
      interfaces.

   o  communication by the dCDN to the uCDN of the logging information
      collected by the dCDN relevant to the uCDN.  This is supported by
      the CDNI Logging interface and in the scope of the present
      document.  For example, the uCDN may use this logging information
      to charge the CSP, to perform analytics and monitoring for
      operational reasons, to provide analytics and monitoring views on

      its content delivery to the CSP or to perform trouble-shooting.
      This document exclusively specifies non-real-time exchange of
      logging information.  Closer to real-time exchange of logging
      information (say sub-minute or sub-second) is outside the scope of
      the present document and left for further study.  This document
      exclusively specifies exchange of logging information related to
      content delivery.  Exchange of logging information related to
      operational events (e.g. dCDN request routing function
      unavailable, content acquisition failure by dCDN) for audit or
      operational reactive adjustments by uCDN is outside the scope of
      the present document and left for further study.

   o  customization by the dCDN of the logging to be performed by the
      uCDN on behalf of the dCDN.  The mechanism to support the
      customisation by the dCDN of CDNI Logging information is outside
      the scope of this document and left for further study.

   o  generation and collection by the uCDN of logging information
      related to the completion of any task performed by the uCDN on
      behalf of the dCDN (e.g., serving of content by uCDN to dCDN for
      acquisition purposes by dCDN) or related to events happening in
      the uCDN that are relevant to the dCDN.  This takes place within
      the uCDN and does not directly involve CDNI interfaces.

   o  communication by the uCDN to the dCDN of the logging information
      collected by the uCDN relevant to the dCDN.  For example, the dCDN
      might potentially benefit from this information for security
      auditing or content acquisition troubleshooting.  This is outside
      the scope of this document and left for further study.

   Figure 1 provides an example of CDNI Logging interactions (focusing
   only on the interactions that are in the scope of this document) in a
   particular scenario where 4 CDNs are involved in the delivery of
   content from a given CSP: the uCDN has a CDNI interconnection with
   dCDN-1 and dCDN-2.  In turn, dCDN2 has a CDNI interconnection with
   dCDN3.  In this example, uCDN, dCDN-1, dCDN-2 and dCDN-3 all
   participate in the delivery of content for the CSP.  In this example,
   the CDNI Logging interface enables the uCDN to obtain logging
   information from all the dCDNs involved in the delivery.  In the
   example, uCDN uses the Logging data:

   o  to analyze the performance of the delivery operated by the dCDNs
      and to adjust its operations after the fact (e.g., request
      routing) as appropriate,

   o  to provide (non real-time) reporting and monitoring information to
      CSP.

   For instance, uCDN merges Logging data, extracts relevant KPIs, and
   presents a formatted report to the CSP, in addition to a bill for the
   content delivered by uCDN itself or by its dCDNs on his behalf. uCDN
   may also provide Logging data as raw log files to the CSP, so that
   the CSP can use its own logging analysis tools.

   ===> CDNI Logging Interface
   ***> outside the scope of CDNI


          Figure 1: Interactions in CDNI Logging Reference Model

   A dCDN (e.g., dCDN-2) integrates the relevant logging information
   obtained from its dCDNs (e.g., dCDN-3) in the logging information
   that it provides to the uCDN, so that the uCDN ultimately obtains all
   logging information relevant to a CSP for which it acts as the
   authoritative CDN.

   Note that the format of Logging information that a CDN provides over
   the CDNI interface might be different from the one that the CDN uses
   internally.  In this case, the CDN needs to reformat the Logging
   information before it provides this information to the other CDN over
   the CDNI Logging interface.  Similarly, a CDN might reformat the
   Logging data that it receives over the CDNI Logging interface before
   injecting it into its log-consuming applications or before providing
   some of this logging information to the CSP.  Such reformatting
   operations introduce latency in the logging distribution chain and

   introduce a processing burden.  Therefore, there are benefits in
   specifying CDNI Logging format that are suitable for use inside CDNs
   and also are close to the CDN Log formats commonly used in CDNs
   today.

2.2.  Overall Logging Chain

   This section discusses the overall logging chain within and across
   CDNs to clarify how CDN Logging information is expected to fit in
   this overall chain.  Figure 2 illustrates the overall logging chain
   within the dCDN, across CDNs using the CDNI Logging interface and
   within the uCDN.  Note that the logging chain illustrated in the
   Figure is obviously only an example and varies depending on the
   specific environments.  For example, there may be more or less
   instantiations of each entity (i.e., there may be 4 Log consuming
   applications in a given CDN).  As another example, there may be one
   instance of Rectification process per Log Consuming Application
   instead of a shared one.

            Figure 2: CDNI Logging in the overall Logging Chain

   The following subsections describe each of the processes potentially
   involved in the logging chain of Figure 2.

2.2.1.  Logging Generation and During-Generation Aggregation

   CDNs typically generate logging information for all significant task
   completions, events, and failures.  Logs are typically generated by
   many devices in the CDN including the surrogates, the request routing
   system, and the control system.

   The amount of Logging information generated can be huge.  Therefore,
   during contract negotiations, interconnected CDNs often agree on a
   Logging retention duration, and optionally, on a maximum size of the
   Logging data that the dCDN must keep.  If this size is exceeded, the
   dCDN must alert the uCDN but may not keep more Logs for the
   considered time period.  In addition, CDNs may aggregate logs and
   transmit only summaries for some categories of operations instead of
   the full Logging data.  Note that such aggregation leads to an
   information loss, which may be problematic for some usages of Logging
   (e.g., debugging).

   [RFC6983] discusses logging for HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS).  In
   accordance with the recommendations articulated there, it is expected
   that a surrogate will generate separate logging information for
   delivery of each chunk of HAS content.  This ensures that separate
   logging information can then be provided to interconnected CDNs over
   the CDNI Logging interface.  Still in line with the recommendations
   of [RFC6983], the logging information for per-chunck delivery may
   include some information (a Content Collection IDentifier and a
   Session IDentifier) intended to facilitate subsequent post-generation
   aggregation of per-chunk logs into per-session logs.  Note that a CDN
   may also elect to generate aggregate per-session logs when performing
   HAS delivery, but this needs to be in addition to, and not instead
   of, the per-chunk delivery logs.  We note that this may be revisited
   in future versions of this document.

   Note that in the case of non real-time logging, the trigger of the
   transmission or generation of the logging file appears to be a
   synchronous process from a protocol standpoint.  The implementation
   algorithm can choose to enforce a maximum size for the logging file
   beyond which the transmission is automatically triggered (and thus
   allow for an asynchronous transmission process).

2.2.2.  Logging Collection

   This is the process that continuously collects logs generated by the
   log-generating entities within a CDN.

   In a CDNI environment, in addition to collecting logging information
   from log-generating entities within the local CDN, the Collection
   process also collects logging information provided by another CDN, or
   other CDNs, through the CDNI Logging interface.  This is illustrated
   in Figure 2 where we see that the Collection process of the uCDN
   collects logging information from log-generating entities within the
   uCDN as well as logging information coming through CDNI Logging
   exchange with the dCDN through the CDNI Logging interface.

2.2.3.  Logging Filtering

   A CDN may require to only present different subset of the whole
   logging information collected to various log-consuming applications.
   This is achieved by the Filtering process.

   In particular, the Filtering process can also filter the right subset
   of information that needs to be provided to a given interconnected
   CDN.  For example, the filtering process in the dCDN can be used to
   ensure that only the logging information related to tasks performed
   on behalf of a given uCDN are made available to that uCDN (thereby
   filtering all the logging information related to deliveries by the
   dCDN of content for its own CSPs).  Similarly, the Filtering process
   may filter or partially mask some fields, for example, to protect End
   Users' privacy when communicating CDNI Logging information to another
   CDN.  Filtering of logging information prior to communication of this
   information to other CDNs via the CDNI Logging interface requires
   that the downstream CDN can recognize the set of log records that
   relate to each interconnected CDN.

   The CDN will also filter some internal scope information such as
   information related to its internal alarms (security, failures, load,
   etc).

   In some use cases described in [RFC6770], the interconnected CDNs do
   not want to disclose details on their internal topology.  The
   filtering process can then also filter confidential data on the

Internet-Draft                CDNI Logging                  October 2013


   dCDNs' topology (number of servers, location, etc.).  In particular,
   information about the requests served by every Surrogate may be
   confidential.  Therefore, the Logging information must be protected
   so that data such as Surrogates' hostnames is not disclosed to the
   uCDN.  In the "Inter-Affiliates Interconnection" use case, this
   information may be disclosed to the uCDN because both the dCDN and
   the uCDN are operated by entities of the same group.

2.2.4.  Logging Rectification and Post-Generation Aggregation

   If Logging is generated periodically, it is important that the
   sessions that start in one Logging period and end in another are
   correctly reported.  If they are reported in the starting period,
   then the Logging of this period will be available only after the end
   of the session, which delays the Logging generation.

   A Logging rectification/update mechanism could be useful to reach a
   good trade-off between the Logging generation delay and the Logging
   accuracy.  Depending on the selected Logging protocol(s), such
   mechanism may be invaluable for real time Logging, which must be
   provided rapidly and cannot wait for the end of operations in
   progress.

   In the presence of HAS, some log-consuming applications can benefit
   from aggregate per-session logs.  For example, for analytics, per-
   session logs allow display of session-related trends which are much
   more meaningful for some types of analysis than chunk-related trends.
   In the case where the log-generating entities have generated during-
   generation aggregate logs, those can be used by the applications.  In
   the case where aggregate logs have not been generated, the
   Rectification process can be extended with a Post-Generation
   Aggregation process that generates per-session logs from the per-
   chunk logs, possibly leveraging the information included in the per-
   chunk logs for that purpose (Content Collection IDentifier and a
   Session IDentifier).  However, in accordance with [RFC6983], this
   document does not define exchange of such aggregate logs on the CDNI
   Logging interface.  We note that this may be revisited in future
   versions of this document.

2.2.5.  Log-Consuming Applications

2.2.5.1.  Maintenance/Debugging

   Logging is useful to permit the detection (and limit the risk) of
   content delivery failures.  In particular, Logging facilitates the
   detection of configuration issues.





Le Faucheur, et al.      Expires April 13, 2014                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                CDNI Logging                  October 2013


   To detect faults, Logging must enable the reporting of any CDN
   delivery operation success and failure.  The uCDN can summarize such
   information into KPIs.  For instance, Logging needs to allow the
   computation of the number of times, during a given time period, that
   content delivery related to a specific service succeeds/fails.

   Logging enables the CDN providers to identify and troubleshoot
   performance degradations.  In particular, Logging enables the
   communication of traffic data (e.g., the amount of traffic that has
   been forwarded by a dCDN on behalf of an uCDN over a given period of
   time), which is particularly useful for CDN and network planning
   operations.

2.2.5.2.  Accounting

   Logging is essential for accounting, to permit inter-CDN billing and
   CSP billing by uCDNs.  For instance, Logging information provided by
   dCDNs enables the uCDN to compute the total amount of traffic
   delivered by every dCDN for a particular Content Provider, as well
   as, the associated bandwidth usage (e.g., peak, 95th percentile), and
   the maximum number of simultaneous sessions over a given period of
   time.

2.2.5.3.  Analytics and Reporting

   The goal of analytics is to gather any relevant information to track
   audience, analyze user behavior, and monitor the performance and
   quality of content delivery.  For instance, Logging enables the CDN
   providers to report on content consumption (e.g., delivered sessions
   per content) in a specific geographic area.

   The goal of reporting is to gather any relevant information to
   monitor the performance and quality of content delivery and allow
   detection of delivery issues.  For instance, reporting could track
   the average delivery throughput experienced by End-Users in a given
   region for a specific CSP or content set over a period of time.

2.2.5.4.  Security

   The goal of security is to prevent and monitor unauthorized access,
   misuse, modification, and denial of access of a service.  A set of
   information is logged for security purposes.  In particular, a record
   of access to content is usually collected to permit the CSP to detect
   infringements of content delivery policies and other abnormal End
   User behaviors.

2.2.5.5.  Legal Logging Duties

Internet-Draft                CDNI Logging                  October 2013


   Depending on the country considered, the CDNs may have to retain
   specific Logging information during a legal retention period, to
   comply with judicial requisitions.

2.2.5.6.  Notions common to multiple Log Consuming Applications

2.2.5.6.1.  Logging Information Views

   Within a given log-consuming application, different views may be
   provided to different users depending on privacy, business, and
   scalability constraints.

   For example, an analytics tool run by the uCDN can provide one view
   to an uCDN operator that exploits all the logging information
   available to the uCDN, while the tool may provide a different view to
   each CSP exploiting only the logging information related to the
   content of the given CSP.

   As another example, maintenance and debugging tools may provide
   different views to different CDN operators, based on their
   operational role.

2.2.5.6.2.  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

   This section presents, for explanatory purposes, a non-exhaustive
   list of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that can be extracted/
   produced from logs.

   Multiple log-consuming applications, such as analytics, monitoring,
   and maintenance applications, often compute and track such KPIs.

   In a CDNI environment, depending on the situation, these KPIs may be
   computed by the uCDN or by the dCDN.  But it is usually the uCDN that
   computes KPIs, because uCDN and dCDN may have different definitions
   of the KPIs and the computation of some KPIs requires a vision of all
   the deliveries performed by the uCDN and all its dCDNs.

   Here is a list of important examples of KPIs:

   o  Number of delivery requests received from End-Users in a given
      region for each piece of content, during a given period of time
      (e.g., hour/day/week/month)

   o  Percentage of delivery successes/failures among the aforementioned
      requests

   o  Number of failures listed by failure type (e.g., HTTP error code)
      for requests received from End Users in a given region and for



Le Faucheur, et al.      Expires April 13, 2014                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                CDNI Logging                  October 2013


      each piece of content, during a given period of time (e.g., hour/
      day/week/month)

   o  Number and cause of premature delivery termination for End Users
      in a given region and for each piece of content, during a given
      period of time (e.g., hour/day/week/month)

   o  Maximum and mean number of simultaneous sessions established by
      End Users in a given region, for a given Content Provider, and
      during a given period of time (e.g., hour/day/week/month)

   o  Volume of traffic delivered for sessions established by End Users
      in a given region, for a given Content Provider, and during a
      given period of time (e.g., hour/day/week/month)

   o  Maximum, mean, and minimum delivery throughput for sessions
      established by End Users in a given region, for a given Content
      Provider, and during a given period of time (e.g., hour/day/week/
      month)

   o  Cache-hit and byte-hit ratios for requests received from End Users
      in a given region for each piece of content, during a given period
      of time (e.g., hour/day/week/month)

   o  Top 10 of the most popularly requested content (during a given day
      /week/month),

   o  Terminal type (mobile, PC, STB, if this information can be
      acquired from the browser type header, for example).

   Additional KPIs can be computed from other sources of information
   than the Logging, for instance, data collected by a content portal or
   by specific client-side application programming interfaces.  Such
   KPIs are out of scope for the present memo.

   The KPIs used depend strongly on the considered log-consuming
   application -- the CDN operator may be interested in different
   metrics than the CSP is.  In particular, CDN operators are often
   interested in delivery and acquisition performance KPIs, information
   related to Surrogates' performance, caching information to evaluate
   the cache-hit ratio, information about the delivered file size to
   compute the volume of content delivered during peak hour, etc.

   Some of the KPIs, for instance those providing an instantaneous
   vision of the active sessions for a given CSP's content, are useful
   essentially if they are provided in real-time.  By contrast, some
   other KPIs, such as the one averaged on a long period of time, can be
   provided in non-real time.

3.  CDNI Logging File

3.1.  Rules

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation and core rules of [RFC5234].  In particular, the present
   document uses the following rules from [RFC5234]:

      CR = %x0D ; carriage return

      DIGIT = %x30-39 ; 0-9

      DQUOTE = %x22 ; " (Double Quote)

      CRLF = CR LF ; Internet standard newline

      HEXDIG = DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"

      HTAB = %x09 ; horizontal tab

      LF = %x0A ; linefeed

      OCTET = %x00-FF ; 8 bits of data

   The present document also uses the following rules from [RFC3986]:

      host = as specified in section 3.2.2 of [RFC3986].

      IPv4address = as specified in section 3.2.2 of [RFC3986].

      IPv6address = as specified in section 3.2.2 of [RFC3986].

   The present document also defines the folowing additional rules:

      ADDRESS = IPv4address / IPv6address

      DATE = 4DIGIT "-" 2DIGIT "-" 2DIGIT

         Dates are recorded in the format YYYY-MM-DD where YYYY, MM and
         DD stand for the numeric year, month and day respectively.  All
         dates are specified in Universal Time Coordinated (UTC).

      DEC = 1*DIGIT ["." *DIGIT]

      QSTRING = DQUOTE *NDQUOTE DQUOTE ; where

         NDQUOTE = <any OCTET excluding DQUOTE> / 2DQUOTE ; whereby a
         DQUOTE is conveyed inside a QSTRING unambiguously by repeating
         it.

      NHTABSTRING = *NHTAB ; where

         NHTAB = <any OCTET excluding HTAB>

      TIME = 2DIGIT ":" 2DIGIT ":" 2DIGIT ["." *DIGIT]

         Times are recorded in the form HH:MM:SS or HH:MM:SS.S where HH
         is the hour in 24 hour format, MM is minutes and SS is seconds.
         All times are specified in Universal Time Coordinated (UTC).

3.2.  CDNI Logging File Structure

   As defined in Section 1.1 a CDNI logging field is as an atomic
   logging information element and a CDNI Logging Record is a collection
   of CDNI Logging Fields containing all logging information
   corresponding to a single logging event.  This document defines a
   third level of structure, the CDNI Logging File, that is a collection
   of CDNI Logging Records.  This structure is illustrated in Figure 3.
   The use of a file structure for transfer of CDNI Logging information
   is selected since this is the most common practise today for exchange
   of logging information within and across CDNs.

                   Figure 3: Structure of Logging Files

   The CDNI Logging File format is inspired from the W3C Extended Log
   File Format [ELF].  However, it is fully specified by the present
   document.  Where the present document differs from the W3C Extended
   Log File Format, an implementation of CDNI Logging MUST comply with
   the present document.

   Using a format that resembles the W3C Extended Log File Format is
   intended to keep CDNI logging format close to intra-CDN logging
   format commonly used in CDNs today, thereby minimizing systematic
   translation at CDN/CDNI boundary.

   A CDNI Logging File MUST contain a sequence of lines containing US-
   ASCII characters [CHAR_SET] terminated by CRLF.

   Each line of a CDNI Logging File MUST contain either a directive or a
   CDNI Logging Record.

   Directives record information about the CDNI Logging process itself.
   Lines containing directives MUST begin with the "#" character.
   Directives are specified in Section 3.3.

   Logging Records provide actual details of the logged event.  Logging
   Records are specified in Section 3.4.

   The CDNI File structure is defined by the following rules:

      DIRLINE = "#" directive CRLF

      DIRGROUP = 1*DIRLINE

      RECLINE = <CDNI Logging Record> CRLF

      RECGROUP = *RECLINE

      <CDNI Logging File> = 1*<DIRGROUP RECGROUP>

3.3.  CDNI Logging File Directives

   The CDNI Logging File directives are defined by the following rules:

      directive = DIRNAME ":" HTAB DIRVAL

      DIRNAME = any CDNI Logging Directive name registered in the CDNI
      Logging Directive Names registry (Section 5.1).

      DIRVAL = <directive value as specified below for each directive
      name>

   An implementation of the CDNI Logging interface MUST support all of
   the following directives, listed below by their directive name:

   o  Version:

      *  format: "CDNI" "/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT

      *  directive value: indicates the version of the CDNI Logging File
         format.  The value MUST be "CDNI/1.0" for the version specified
         in the present document.

      *  occurrence: there MUST be one and only one instance of this
         directive per CDNI Logging File.  It MUST be the first line of
         the CDNI Logging file.

   o  UUID:

      *  format: NHTABSTRING

      *  directive value: this a Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID)
         from the UUID Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace specified
         in [RFC4122]) for the CDNI Logging File .

      *  occurrence: there MUST be one and only one instance of this
         directive per CDNI Logging File.

   o  Claimed-Origin:

      *  format: host

      *  directive value: this contains the claimed identification of
         the entity transmitting the CDNI Logging File (e.g. the host in
         a dCDN supporting the CDNI Logging interface) or the entity
         responsible for transmitting the CDNI Logging File (e.g. the

      *  occurrence: there MUST be zero or one instance of this
         directive per CDNI Logging File.  This directive MAY be
         included by the dCDN.  It MUST NOT be included or modified by
         the uCDN.

   o  Verified-Origin:

      *  format: host

      *  directive value: this contains the identification, as
         established by the entity receiving the CDNI Logging file, of
         the entity transmitting the CDNI Logging File (e.g. the host in
         a dCDN supporting the CDNI Logging interface) or the entity
         responsible for transmitting the CDNI Logging File (e.g. the
         dCDN).

      *  occurrence: there MUST be zero or one instance of this
         directive per CDNI Logging File.  This directive MAY be added
         by the uCDN (e.g. before storing the CDNI Logging File).  It
         MUST NOT be included by the dCDN.  The mechanisms used by the
         uCDN to establish and validate the entity responsible for the
         CDNI Logging File is outside the scope of the present document.
         We observe that, in particular, this may be achieved through
         authentication mechanisms that are part of the CDNI Logging
         File pull mechanism (Section 4.2).

   o  Record-Type:

      *  format: NHTABSTRING

      *  directive value: indicates the type of the CDNI Logging Records
         that follow this directive, until another Record-Type directive
         (or the end of the CDNI Logging File).  This can be any CDNI
         Logging Record type registered in the CDNI Logging Record-types
         registry (Section 5.2).  "cdni_http_request_v1" MUST be
         indicated as the Record-Type directive value for CDNI Logging
         records corresponding to HTTP request (e.g. a HTTP delivery
         request) as specified in Section 3.4.1.

      *  occurrence: there MUST be at least one instance of this
         directive per CDNI Logging File.  The first instance of this
         directive MUST precede a Fields directive and precede any CDNI
         Logging Record.

   o  Fields:

      *  format: FIENAME *<HTAB FIENAME> ; where FIENAME can take any
         CDNI Logging field name registered in the CDNI Logging Field
         Names registry (Section 5.3).

      *  directive value: this lists the names of all the fields for
         which a value is to appear in the CDNI Logging Records that
         follow the instance of this directive (until another instance
         of this directive).  The names of the fields, as well as their
         possible occurrences, are specified for each type of CDNI
         Logging Records in Section 3.4.

      *  occurrence: there MUST be at least one instance of this
         directive per Record-Type directive.  The first instance of
         this directive for a given Record-Type MUST appear before any
         CDNI Logging Record for this Record-Type.

   o  Integrity-Hash:

      *  format: 32HEXDIG

      *  directive value: This directive permits the detection of a
         corrupted CDNI Logging File.  This can be useful, for instance,
         if a problem occurs on the filesystem of the dCDN Logging
         system and leads to a truncation of a logging file.  The valid
         Integrity-Hash value is included in this directive by the
         entity that transmits the CDNI Logging File.  It is computed by
         applying the MD5 ([RFC1321]) cryptographic hash function on the
         CDNI Logging File, including all the directives and logging
         records, up to the Intergrity-Hash directive itself, excluding
         the Integrity-Hash directive itself.  The Integrity-Hash value
         is represented as a US-ASCII encoded hexadecimal number, 32
         digits long (representing a 128 bit hash value).  The entity
         receiving the CDNI Logging File also computes in a similar way
         the MD5 hash on the received CDNI Logging File and compares
         this hash to the value of the Integrity-Hash directive.  If the
         two values are equal, then the received CDNI Logging File MUST
         be considered non-corrupted.  If the two values are different,
         the received CDNI Logging File MUST be considered corrupted.
         The behavior of the entity that received a corrupted CDNI
         Logging File is outside the scope of this specification; we
         note that the entity MAY attempt to pull again the same CDNI

         Logging file from the transmitting entity.  If the entity
         receiving the CDNI Logging File adds a Verified-Origin
         directive, it MUST recompute and update the Integrity-Hash
         directive so it also protects the added Verified-Origin
         directive.

      *  occurrence: there MUST be zero or one instance of this
         directive.  There SHOULD be one instance of this directive.
         One situation where that directive could be omitted is where
         integrity protection is already provided via another mechanism
         (for example if an integrity hash is associated to the CDNI
         Logging file out of band through the CDNI Logging Logging Feed
         Section 4.1 leveraging ATOM extensions such as those proposed
         in [I-D.snell-atompub-link-extensions].  When present, this
         field MUST be the last line of the CDNI Logging File.

3.4.  CDNI Logging Records

   A CDNI Logging Record consists of a sequence of CDNI Logging Fields
   relating to that single CDNI Logging Record.

   CDNI Logging Fields MUST be separated by the "horizontal tabulation
   (HTAB)" character.

   To facilitate readability, a prefix scheme is used for CDNI Logging
   field names in a similar way to the one used in W3C Extended Log File
   Format [ELF] . The semantics of the prefix in the present document
   is:

   o  c: refers to the User Agent that issues the request (corresponds
      to the "client" of W3C Extended Log Format)

   o  d: refers to the dCDN (relative to a given CDN acting as a uCDN)

   o  s: refers to the dCDN Surrogate that serves the request
      (corresponds to the "server" of W3C Extended Log Format)

   o  u: refers to the uCDN (relative to a given CDN acting as a dCDN)

   o  cs: refers to communication from the User-Agent towards the dCDN
      Surrogate

   o  sc: refers to communication from the dCDN Surrogate towards the
      User-Agent

   An implementation of the CDNI Logging interface as per the present
   specification MUST support the CDNI HTTP Delivery Records as
   specified in Section 3.4.1.

   A CDNI Logging Record is defined by the following rules:

      FIEVAL = <CDNI Logging Field value>

      <CDNI Logging Record> = FIEVAL *<HTAB FIEVAL> ; where FIEVAL
      contains the CDNI Logging field values corresponding to the CDNI
      Logging field names (FIENAME) listed is the last Fields directive
      predecing the present CDNI Logging Record.

3.4.1.  HTTP Request Logging Record

   The HTTP Request Logging Record is a CDNI Logging Record of Record-
   Type "cdni_http_request_v1".  It contains the following CDNI Logging
   Fields, listed by their field name:

   o  date:

      *  format: DATE

      *  field value: the date at which the processing of request
         completed on the Surrogate.

      *  occurrence: there MUST be one and only one instance of this
         field.

   o  time:

      *  format: TIME

      *  field value: the time at which the processing of request
         completed on the Surrogate.

      *  occurrence: there MUST be one and only one instance of this
         field.

   o  time-taken:

      *  format: DEC

      *  field value: decimal value of the duration, in seconds, between
         the start of the processing of the request and the completion
         of the request processing (e.g. completion of delivery) by the
         Surrogate.

      *  occurrence: there MUST be one and only one instance of this
         field.

   o  c-ip:

      *  format: ADDRESS

      *  field value: the source IPv4 or IPv6 address (i.e. the "client"
         address) in the request received by the Surrogate.

      *  occurrence: there MUST be one and only one instance of this
         field.

   o  c-ip-anonimizing:

      *  format: 1*DIGIT

      *  field value: the number of rightmost bits of the address in the
         c-ip field that are zeroed-out in order to anonymize the
         logging record.  The mechanism by which the two ends of the
         CDNI Logging interface agree on whether anonimization is to be
         supported and the number of bits that need to be zeroed-out for
         this purpose are outside the scope of the present document.

      *  occurrence: there MUST be zero or one instance of this field.

   o  c-port:

      *  format: 1*DIGIT

      *  field value: the source TCP port (i.e. the "client" port) in
         the request received by the Surrogate.

      *  occurrence: there MUST be zero or exactly one instance of this
         field.

   o  s-ip:

      *  format: ADDRESS

      *  field value: the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the Surrogate that
         served the request (i.e. the "server" address).

      *  occurrence: there MUST be zero or exactly one instance of this
         field.

   o  s-hostname:

      *  format: host

      *  field value: the hostname of the Surrogate that served the
         request (i.e. the "server" hostname).

         field.

   o  s-port:

      *  format: 1*DIGIT

      *  field value: the destination TCP port (i.e. the "server" port)
         in the request received by the Surrogate.

      *  occurrence: there MUST be zero or exactly one instance of this
         field.

   o  cs-method:

      *  format: NHTABSTRING

      *  field value: this is the HTTP method of the HTTP request
         received by the Surrogate.

      *  occurrence: There MUST be one and only one instance of this
         field.

   o  cs-uri:

      *  format: NHTABSTRING

      *  field value: this is the complete URL of the request received
         by the Surrogate.  It is exactly in the format of a http_URL
         specified in [RFC2616]) or, when the request was a HTTPS
         request ([RFC2818]), it is in the format of a http_URL but with
         the scheme part set to "https" instead of "http".

      *  occurrence: there MUST be zero or exactly one instance of this
         field.

   o  u-uri:

      *  format: NHTABSTRING

      *  field value: this is a complete URL, derived from the complete
         URI of the request received by the Surrogate (i.e.  the cs-uri)
         but transformed by the entity generating or transmitting the
         CDNI Logging Record, in a way that is agreed upon between the
         two ends of the CDNI Logging interface, so the transformed URI
         is meaningful to the uCDN.  For example, the two ends of the
         CDNI Logging interface could agree that the u-uri is
         constructed from the cs-uri by removing the part of the

         performed the delivery.  The details of modification performed
         to generate the u-uri, as well as the mechanism to agree on
         these modifications between the two sides of the CDNI Logging
         interface are outside the scope of the present document.

      *  occurrence: there MUST be one and only one instance of this
         field.

   o  protocol:

      *  format: NHTABSTRING

      *  field value: this is value of the HTTP-Version field as
         specified in [RFC2616] of the Request-Line of the request
         received by the Surrogate (e.g.  "HTTP/1.1").

      *  occurrence: there MUST be one and only one instance of this

      *  occurrence: there MUST be zero or exactly one instance of this
         field.

   o  cs(<HTTP-header-name>):

      *  format: QSTRING

      *  field value: the value of the HTTP header (identified by the
         <HTTP-header-name> in the CDNI Logging field name) as it
         appears in the request processed by the Surrogate.  For
         example, when the CDNI Logging field name (FIENAME) listed in
         the prededing Fields directive is "cs(User-Agent"), this CDNI
         Logging field value contains the value of the User-Agent HTTP
         header as received by the Surrogate in the request it
         processed.

      *  occurrence: there MUST be zero, one or any number of instance

      *  format: QSTRING

      *  field value: this contains the value of a Session IDentifier
         generated by the dCDN for a specific HTTP Adaptive Streaming
         (HAS) session and whose value is included in the Logging record
         for every content chunk delivery of that session in view of
         facilitating the later correlation of all the per content chunk
         log records of a given HAS session.  See section 3.4.2.2. of
         [RFC6983] for more discussion on the concept of Session
         IDentifier.

      *  occurrence: there MUST be zero or exactly one instance of this
         field.

   o  s-cached:

      *  format: 1DIGIT

      *  field value: this characterises whether the Surrogate served
         the request using content already stored on its local cache or
         not.  The allowed values are "0" (for miss) and "1" (for hit).
         "1" MUST be used when the Surrogate did serve the request using
         exclusively content already stored on its local cache. "0" MUST
         be used otherwise (including cases where the Surrogate served
         the request using some, but not all, content already stored on
         its local cache).  Note that a "0" only means a cache miss in
         the Surrogate and does not provide any information on whether
         the content was already stored, or not, in another device of
         the dCDN i.e. whether this was a "dCDN hit" or "dCDN miss".

      *  occurrence: there MUST be zero or exactly one instance of this

   The "Fields" directive corresponding to a HTTP Request Logging Record
   MUST list all the fields name whose occurrence is specified above as

4.  CDNI Logging File Exchange Protocol

   This document specifies a protocol for the exchange of CDNI Logging
   Files as specified in Section 3.

   This protocol comprises:

   o  a CDNI Logging feed, allowing the dCDN to notify the uCDN about
      the CDNI Logging files that can be retrieved by that uCDN from the

   o  a CDNI Logging File pull mechanism, allowing the uCDN to obtain
      from the dCDN a given CDNI Logging File at the uCDN convenience.
      The CDNI Logging File pull mechanisms is specified in Section 4.2.

   An implementation of the CDNI Logging interface as per the present
   document generating CDNI Logging file (i.e. on the dCDN side) MUST
   support the server side of the CDNI Logging feed and the server side
   of the CDNI Logging pull mechanism.

   An implementation of the CDNI Logging interface as per the present
   document consuming CDNI Logging file (i.e. on the uCDN side) MUST
   support the client side of the CDNI Logging feed and the client side
   of the CDNI Logging pull mechanism.

   We note that implementations of the CDNI Logging interface MAY also
   support other mechanisms to exchange CDNI Logging Files, for example
   in view of exchanging logging information with minimum time-lag (e.g.
   sub-minute or sub-second) between when the event occurred in the dCDN
   and when the corresponding Logging Record is made available to the
   uCDN (e.g. for log-consuming applications requiring extremely fresh
   logging information such as near-real-time content delivery
   monitoring).  Such mechanisms are outside the scope of the present
   document but might be defined in future version of this document .

4.1.  CDNI Logging Feed

Internet-Draft                CDNI Logging                  October 2013


   The server-side implementation of the CDNI Logging feed MUST produce
   an Atom feed [RFC4287].  This feed is used to advertise log files
   that are available for the client-side to retrieve using the CDNI
   Logging pull mechanism.

4.1.1.  Atom Formatting

   A CDNI Logging feed MUST be structured as an Archived feed, as
   defined in [RFC5005], and MUST be formatted in Atom [RFC4287].  This
   means it consists of a subscription document that is regularly
   updated as new CDNI logging files become available, and information
   about older CDNI Logging files is moved into archive documents.  Once
   created, archive documents are never modified.

   Each CDNI Logging file listed in an Atom feed MUST be described in an
   atom:entry container element.

   The atom:entry MUST contain an atom:content element whose "src"
   attribute is a link to the CDNI Logging file and whose "type"
   attribute is the MIME Media Type indicating that the entry is a CDNI
   Logging File.  We define this MIME Media Type as "application/
   cdni.LoggingFile" (See Section 5.4).

   For compatibility with some Atom feed readers the atom:entry MAY also
   contain an atom:link entry whose "href" attribute is a link to the
   CDNI Logging file and whose "type" attribute is the MIME Media Type
   indicating that the entry is a CDNI Logging File using the
   "application/cdni.LoggingFile" MIME Media Type (See Section 5.4).

   The IRI used in the atom:id of the atom:entry MUST contain the UUID
   of the CDNI Logging file.

   The atom:updated in the atom:entry MUST indicate the time at which
   the CDNI Logging file was last updated.

4.1.2.  Updates to Log Files and the Feed

   CDNI Logging files MUST NOT be modified by the dCDN once published in
   the CDNI Logging feed.

   The frequency with which the subscription feed is updated, the period
   of time covered by each CDNI Logging file or each archive document,
   and timeliness of publishing of CDNI Logging files is outside the
   scope of the present document and is expected to be agreed upon by
   uCDN and dCDN via other means (e.g. human agreement).

   The server-side implementation MUST retain, and be ready to serve,
   any CDNI Logging File currently published by the server-side in the
   subscription document of the CDNI Logging Feed.

   The server-side implementation SHOULD use HTTP cache control headers
   on the subscription feed to indicate the frequency at which the
   client-side is to poll for updates.

4.1.3.  Redundant Feeds

   The server-side implementation MAY present more than one CDNI Logging
   feed and for redundancy, CDNI Logging files MAY be published in more
   than one feed.

   A client-side implementation MAY support such redundant CDNI Logging
   feeds.  If it supports redundant CDNI Logging feed, the client-side
   SHOULD use the UUID of the CDNI Logging file, presented in the
   atom:id element of the Atom feed, to avoid uncessarily pulling and
   storing each CDNI Logging file more than once.

   CDNI Logging feed.

4.2.  CDNI Logging File Pull

   A client-side implementation of the CDNI Logging interface MUST pull,
   at its convenience, a CDNI Logging File that is published by the
   server-side in the CDNI Logging Feed.  To do so, the client-side:

   o  MUST use HTTP v1.1 ( [RFC2616]);

   o  SHOULD use TLS (i.e. use what is loosely referred to as "HTTPS")
      as per [RFC2818] whenever protection of the CDNI Logging
      information is required (see Section 6.1);

   o  MUST use the URI that was associated to the CDNI Logging File
      (within the "src" attribute of the corresponding atom:content
      element) in the CDNI Logging Feed

   o  MUST support exchange of CDNI Logging Files with no content
      encoding applied to the representation;

   o  SHOULD support exchange of CDNI Logging Files with "gzip" content
      encoding (as defined in [RFC2616]) applied to the representation.







Le Faucheur, et al.      Expires April 13, 2014                [Page 33]

Internet-Draft                CDNI Logging                  October 2013


   Note that a client-side implementation of the CDNI Logging interface
   MAY pull a CDNI Logging File that it has already pulled, as long as
   the file is still published by the server-side in the subscription
   document of CDNI Logging Feed.

   The server-side implementation MUST respond to any valid pull request
   by a client-side implementation for a CDNI Logging File published by
   the server-side in the subscription document of the CDNI Logging
   Feed.  The server-side implementation:

   o  MUST handle the client-side request as per HTTP v1.1;

   o  MUST include the CDNI Logging File identified by the request URI
      inside the body of the HTTP response;

   o  MUST support exchange of CDNI Logging Files with no content
      encoding applied to the representation;

   o  SHOULD support exchange of CDNI Logging Files with "gzip" content
      encoding (as defined in [RFC2616]) applied to the representation.

   Content negotiation approaches defined in [RFC2616] (e.g. using
   Accept-Encoding request-header field or Content-Encoding entity-
   header field) MAY be used by the client-side and server-side
   implementations to establish the content-coding to be used for a
   particular exchange of a CDNI Logging File.

   Applying compression content encoding (such as "gzip") is expected to
   mitigate the impact of exchanging the large volumes of logging
   information expected across CDNs.  This is expected to be
   particularly useful in the presence of HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS)
   which, as per the present version of the document, will result in a
   separate CDNI Log Record for each HAS segment delivery in the CDNI
   Logging File.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Authentication, Confidentiality, Integrity Protection




Le Faucheur, et al.      Expires April 13, 2014                [Page 36]

Internet-Draft                CDNI Logging                  October 2013


   The use of TLS as per [RFC2818] for transport of the CDNI Logging
   feed mechanism (Section 4.1) and CDNI Logging File pull mechanism
   (Section 4.2) allows:

   o  the dCDN and uCDN to authenticate each other (to ensure they are
      transmitting/receiving CDNI Logging File from an authenticated
      CDN)

   o  the CDNI Logging information to be transmitted with
      confidentiality

   o  the integrity of the CDNI Logging information to be protected
      during the exchange

   In an environment where any such protection is required, TLS SHOULD
   be used for transport of the CDNI Logging feed and the CDNI Logging
   File pull.

   A CDNI Logging implementation MUST support TLS transport of the CDNI
   Logging feed and the CDNI Logging File pull.

   The Integrity-Hash directive inside the CDNI Logging File provides
   additional integrity protection, this time targeting potential
   corruption of the CDNI logging information during the CDNI Logging
   File generation.  This mechanism does not allow restoration of the
   corrupted CDNI Logging information, but it allows detection of such
   corruption and therefore triggering of appropraite correcting actions
   (e.g. discard of corrupted information, attempt to re-obtain the CDNI
   Logging information).

6.2.  Privacy

   CDNs have the opportunity to collect detailed information about the
   downloads performed by End-Users.  The provision of this information
   to another CDN introduces potential End-Users privacy protection
   concerns.  We observe that when CDNI interconnection is realised as
   per [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework], the uCDN handles the initial End-User
   requests (before it is redirected to the dCDN) so, regardless of
   which information is, or is not, communicated to the uCDN through the
   CDNI Logging interface, the uCDN has visibility on significant
   information such as the IP address of the End-User request and the
   URL of the request.  Nonetheless, if the dCDN and uCDN agree that
   anonymization is required to avoid making some detailed information
   available to the uCDN (such as how much bytes of the content has been
   watched by an enduser and/or at what time) or is required to meet
   some legal obligations, then the uCDN and dCDN can agree to exchange
   anonymized End-User IP addresses in CDNI Logging files and the c-ip-
   anonymization field can be used to convey the number of bits that

   have been anonymized so that the meaningful information can still be
   easily extracted from the anonymized addressses (e.g. for geolocation
   aware analytics).

Appendix A.  Compliance with CDNI Requirements

   [Editor's Note: this section may need a small update if ietf-cdni-
   requirements introduces an additional requirement for Privacy/
   Anonimization as recently discussed on the list, and if LI14 & LI-15
   are modified]

   The three tables below review compliance against, respectively, the
   Generic CDNI requirements, the CDNI Logging interafce requirements
   and the CDNI security requirements of [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements].
   The first two columns of the tables indicate the requirement number,
   and the requirement priority as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements].  The third column of the table
   indicates the level of compliance of the CDNI Logging interface
   specified in the present document against the given requirement, and
   the fourth column provides additional comment and explanation on how
   or why the compliance is achieved or not achieved.
