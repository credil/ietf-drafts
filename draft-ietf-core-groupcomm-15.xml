      <t>
      CoAP is a specialized web transfer protocol for constrained devices and constrained networks.  It is
      anticipated that constrained devices will often naturally operate in groups 
      (e.g., in a building automation scenario all lights in a given room may
      need to be switched on/off as a group). This document provides guidance for
      how the CoAP protocol should be used in a group communication context.  An approach for
      using CoAP on top of IP multicast is detailed.  Also, various use cases and corresponding protocol
      flows are provided to illustrate important concepts. Finally, guidance is
      provided for deployment in various network topologies.

  <section title="Background">
    <t>
    Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a Representational State Transfer (REST)
    based web transfer protocol for resource constrained devices operating in an IP
    network <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/>.  CoAP has many similarities to HTTP <xref target="RFC2616" />
    but also has some key differences. Constrained devices can be large in numbers, but are often related to
    each other in function or location. For example, all the light switches in a building may
    belong to one group and all the thermostats may belong to another group.
    Groups may be pre-configured before deployment or dynamically formed during operation. If information
    needs to be sent to or received from a group of devices, group communication
    mechanisms can improve efficiency and latency of communication and reduce
    bandwidth requirements for a given application.  HTTP does not
    support any equivalent functionality to CoAP group communication.</t>
  </section>

  <!-- section anchor="sec-1.2" title="Scope" -->
  <section title="Scope">
    <t>Group communication involves a one-to-many relationship between CoAP endpoints.
    Specifically, a single CoAP client will simultaneously get (or set) resource representations
    from multiple CoAP servers using CoAP over IP multicast.  An example would be a CoAP light
    switch turning on/off multiple lights in a room with a single CoAP group communication PUT
    request, and handling the potential multitude of (unicast) responses.</t>

    <t>The normative protocol aspects of running CoAP on top of IP Multicast and processing the responses are given
    in <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/>. The main contribution of this document lies in
    providing additional guidance for several important group communication features.  Among the topics covered are
    group definition, group resource manipulation, and group configuration. Also, proxy operation and
    minimizing network congestion for group communication is discussed. Finally, specific use cases 
    and deployment guidelines for CoAP group communication are outlined.

  <!-- section anchor="sec-2.1" title="IP Multicast Background" -->
  <section title="IP Multicast Background">
	  
    <t>
    IP Multicast protocols have been evolving for decades, resulting in 
    standards such as Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse
    Mode (PIM-SM) <xref target="RFC4601" />. IP Multicast is very popular in specific
    deployments such as in enterprise networks
    (e.g., for video conferencing), smart home networks (e.g., Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)) 
    and carrier IPTV deployments.  The packet economy and minimal host complexity of
    IP multicast make it attractive for group communication in constrained environments.
    </t>
    <t>To achieve IP multicast beyond link-local scope, an IP multicast routing or forwarding protocol needs to be
	    active on IP routers. An example of a routing protocol specifically for LLNs is  
	    the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)
	    (Section 12 of <xref target="RFC6550"/>) and an example of a forwarding protocol for LLNs
	    is Multicast Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (MPL) 
	    <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-trickle-mcast" />.  RPL and MPL do not depend on each other;
	    each can be used in isolation and both can be used in combination in a network.  
	    Finally, PIM-SM  <xref target="RFC4601" /> is
	    often used for multicast routing in regular IP networks (i.e. networks that are not constrained). 
    </t>

    <t>IP multicast can also be run in a Link-Local (LL) scope.  This means that there is no routing
       involved and an IP multicast message is only received over the link on which it was sent.
    </t>

    <t>For a complete IP multicast solution, in addition to a routing/forwarding protocol, a
	    "listener" protocol may be needed for the devices to subscribe to groups 
	    (see <xref target="deploy_mld"/>).
    </t>

  </section>

  <!-- section anchor="sec-2.2" title="Group Definition and Naming" -->
  <section title="Group Definition and Naming">
    <t>
    A group is defined as a set of CoAP endpoints, where each endpoint is configured to receive  
    multicast CoAP requests that are sent to the group's associated IP multicast address. An endpoint
    MAY be a member of multiple groups. Group membership of an endpoint MAY dynamically change over time.
    </t>
	    
    <t>A Group URI has the scheme 'coap' and includes in the authority part either a group IP multicast address or a hostname 
       (e.g., Group Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)) that can be resolved to the group IP multicast address. 
       A Group URI also contains an optional CoAP port number in the authority part.
       Group URIs follow the CoAP URI syntax <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/>.</t>  

    <t>Note: A Group URI is needed to initiate CoAP group communications.  For CoAP implementations that
	    accept a CoAP URI as input in the group communications request API,
	    it is recommended to use the parsing method of Section 6.4 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/>,
	    in such way that a CoAP multicast request is generated.</t>  

    <t> It is recommended, for sending nodes, to use the IP multicast address literal in a Group URI. 
	In case a Group hostname is used, it can be uniquely mapped to a site-local or global IP multicast address via DNS
	resolution (if supported). Some examples of hierarchical Group FQDN naming (and scoping) for
	a building control application are shown below (and are derived from <xref target="I-D.vanderstok-core-dna" />):

    <figure><artwork>
  URI authority                           Targeted group of nodes
  --------------------------------------- --------------------------
  all.bldg6.example.com                   "all nodes in building 6"
  all.west.bldg6.example.com              "all nodes in west wing, 
                                           building 6"
  all.floor1.west.bldg6.example.com       "all nodes in floor 1, 
                                           west wing, building 6"
  all.bu036.floor1.west.bldg6.example.com "all nodes in office bu036,
                                           floor1, west wing, 
                                           building 6"
    </artwork></figure>
    </t>
    
    <t>Similarly, if supported, reverse mapping (from IP multicast address to Group FQDN) is possible
	    using the reverse DNS resolution technique (<xref target="I-D.vanderstok-core-dna" />).
    </t>
  </section>



 <!-- section anchor="sec-2.3" title="Port and URI Configuration" -->  
  <section title="Port and URI Configuration">
	 
    <t>
    A CoAP server that is a member of a group listens for CoAP messages on the group's IP multicast address,
    on a specified UDP port. The default UDP port is the CoAP default port 5683 but 
    a non-default UDP port MAY be specified for the group; in which case implementers 
    MUST ensure that all group members are configured to use this same port.
    </t>

    <t>
      Multicast based group communication will not work if there is diversity in the authority
      port (e.g., different dynamic port addresses across the group) or if other parts of the
      URI such as the path, or the query, differ on different endpoints.

    	Therefore, some measures must be present to ensure uniformity in port number
    	and resource names/locations within a group.  
    
	    All CoAP multicast requests MUST be sent using a port number according to one of below options:
	    <list style="numbers">
	    	<t> A pre-configured port number. The pre-configuration mechanism MUST ensure
	    	    that the same port number is pre-configured across all endpoints in a group and across
	    	    all CoAP clients performing the group requests.</t>
	    	<t> If the client is configured to use service discovery including port discovery,
	    	 	  it uses a port number obtained via a service discovery lookup operation 
		        for the targeted CoAP multicast group.</t>
	    	<t> Use the default CoAP UDP port (5683).</t>
			</list>
	</t>


    <t>All CoAP multicast requests SHOULD operate on URI paths in one of the following ways:
			 <list style="numbers">
			 	<t> Pre-configured URI paths, if available. The pre-configuration mechanism SHOULD ensure that these paths 
			 		  are pre-configured across all CoAP servers in a group and all CoAP clients performing
					  the group requests.  Note that <xref target="I-D.ietf-appsawg-uri-get-off-my-lawn"/> prescribes that
					  any specification must not constrain, define structure or semantics for any path component.			
				  </t>


			 	<t> If the client is configured to use default CoRE resource discovery, it uses URI paths 
			 			retrieved from a "/.well-known/core" lookup on a 
			 			group member. The URI paths the client will use MUST be known 
			 			to be available also in all other endpoints in the group. The URI path configuration mechanism on servers
			 			MUST ensure that these URIs (identified as being supported by the group) are configured on 
			 			all group endpoints.</t>
			 	<t> If the client is configured to use another form of service discovery, it uses URI paths 
						from an equivalent service discovery lookup which returns the
		      	resources supported by all group members.</t>
		    <t> If the client has received a Group URI through a previous RESTful interaction with a trusted server,
		    	  for the purpose of the client using this URI in a request, it can use this URI in a multicast request.
		    	  For example, a commissioning tool may instruct a sensor device in this way to which target (multicast
		    	  URI) it should report sensor events.</t>

  <!-- section anchor="sec-2.4" title="Group Methods" -->
  <section title="Group Methods">
      
    <t>Idempotent methods (i.e., CoAP GET, PUT, and DELETE) SHOULD be used for group communication,
	    with one exception as follows.  A non-idempotent method (i.e., CoAP POST) MAY be used
	    for group communication if the resource being POSTed to has been designed to cope with
	    the lossy nature of multicast.  Note that not all group members are guaranteed to receive
	    the multicast request, and the sender cannot readily find out which group members did not
	    receive it.</t>

   <t>All CoAP messages that are sent via multicast MUST be Non-confirmable.
      A unicast response per server MAY be sent back to answer the group communication request
      (e.g., response "2.05 Content" to a group GET request) taking into
      account the congestion control rules defined in
      <xref target="Congestion_Control"/>.  The unicast responses received may be a mixture
      of success (e.g., 2.05 Content) and failure (e.g., 4.04 Not Found)

	<t>The group membership of a CoAP endpoint may be configured in one of the following ways.
	First, the group membership may be pre-configured before node deployment. Second, a node may
	be programmed to discover (query) its group membership during operation using a specific service
	discovery means. Third, it may be configured during operation by another node
       	(e.g., a commissioning device). 
	</t>

	<t>
	In the first case, the pre-configured group information may be either directly a IP multicast
	address, or a hostname (FQDN) which is during operation resolved to a IP multicast address
       	by the endpoint using DNS (if supported). 
	</t>

	<t>
	For the second case, a CoAP endpoint may look up its group membership using techniques such as
       	DNS-SD and Resource Directory <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory"/>. The latter
	is detailed more in <xref target="CommissioningWithRD"/>.
	</t>

	<t>
	In the third case, typical in scenarios such as building control, a commissioning tool
	determines to which group a sensor or actuator node belongs, and writes this information to the 
	node, which can subsequently join the correct IP multicast group on its network interface. The 
	information written may again be an IP multicast address or a hostname.

	      <section title="RESTful Interface" anchor="ConfiguringMembersRestful">

	<t>
	To achieve better interoperability between endpoints from different manufacturers, 
	an OPTIONAL RESTful interface for configuring CoAP endpoints with relevant group 
	information is described here. This interface provides a solution for the third
	case mentioned above. To access this interface a client MUST use unicast methods (GET/PUT/POST/DELETE) 
	only as it is a method of configuring group information in individual endpoints.
	Using multicast operations in this situation may lead to unexpected (possibly circular) behavior in the network.
	Also, the (unicast) methods to configure group membership SHOULD use DTLS-secured CoAP
       	<xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/>.  Thus only authorized controllers should be allowed by
       	an endpoint to configure its group membership.
	</t>
	

	<t>
	CoAP endpoints implementing this optional mechanism MUST support the group configuration Internet Media Type
	"application/coap-group+json" (<xref  target="InternetMediaType"/>).  A resource offering this representation can
       	be annotated for direct discovery <xref target="RFC6690"/> using the resource type (rt) "core.gp" where "gp" is shorthand for
	"group" (<xref  target="ResourceType"/>). An authorized controller uses this media type to query/manage group membership
	of a CoAP endpoint as defined below.
	</t>




		  
              <!-- section anchor="sec-2.6.2.1" title="GET Interface" --> 
	      <section title="GET Interface" anchor="ConfiguringMembersGET">

	<t>
	The group configuration resource has a JSON-based content format (as indicated by the media type). A (unicast)
	GET on a CoAP endpoint with a resource with this format returns a JSON array of group 
	objects, each group object being a JSON object that indicates one multicast group membership. 
	The example below illustrates a request to an endpoint querying its group membership information,
       	where the response is in the "application/coap-group+json" content format 
	containing a single group object:

<figure><artwork>	
   Req: GET /gp

   ]   
</artwork></figure>
	</t>

  <t>
   In a response, the OPTIONAL "n" key/value pair stands for "name" and identifies the group 
   with a hostname, for example a FQDN.</t>

  <t>
   The "a" key/value pair specifies the IP multicast address (and optionally the port number)
   of the group.  It contains an IPv6 address or an IPv4 address in dotted decimal notation. The following ABNF
   rule can be used for parsing the address, referring to the definitions in 
   Section 6 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> and  <xref target="RFC3986"/>.

	CoAP <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> and CoRE Link Format <xref target="RFC6690"/> define
	normative behaviors for:
	
	<list style="numbers">
		<t>Multicast request acceptance - in which cases a CoAP request is accepted and executed, and when not.</t>
		<t>Multicast response suppression - in which cases the CoAP response to an already-executed request is returned to

	</list>
	
	A CoAP response differs from a CoAP ACK; ACKs are never sent by servers in response to a multicast CoAP 
	request. This section first summarizes these normative behaviors and then presents additional guidelines
	for response suppression.  Also a number of multicast example applications are given to illustrate the overall approach.
	</t>
	<t>
	To apply any rules for request and/or response suppression, a CoAP server must be aware that an incoming request
	arrived via multicast by making use of APIs such as IPV6_RECVPKTINFO <xref target="RFC3542"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
	For multicast request acceptance, the REQUIRED behaviors are:

		<t>A server SHOULD NOT accept a multicast request that cannot be "authenticated" in some way (cryptographically 
			or by some multicast boundary limiting the potential sources) <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/>.  See 
			<xref target="Security_Mitigation"/> for examples of multicast boundary limiting methods.
		</t>
		<t>A server SHOULD NOT accept a multicast discovery request with a query string (as defined in CoRE Link Format
		<xref target="RFC6690"/>) if filtering (<xref target="RFC6690"/>) is not supported by the server.</t>
		<t>A server SHOULD NOT accept a multicast request that acts on a specific resource for which multicast support 
			is not required. (Note that for the resource "/.well-known/core", multicast support is required
		       	if "multicast resource discovery" is supported as specified in section 1.2.1 of <xref target="RFC6690"/>).
			Implementers are advised to disable multicast support by default on any other resource, until explicitly
			enabled by an application or by	configuration.)</t>
		<t>Otherwise accept the multicast request.</t>

	</list>
       </t>

	<t>
	For multicast response suppression, the REQUIRED behaviors are: 
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>A server SHOULD NOT respond to a multicast discovery request if the filter specified by the request's
		   query string does not match.</t>
		<t>A server MAY choose not to respond to a multicast request, if there's nothing useful to respond (e.g., error 
			 or empty response).</t>
		 <t>Otherwise respond to the multicast request.</t>
	</list>

	</t>
	
	<t>
	The above response suppression behaviors are complemented by the following guidelines.
	CoAP servers SHOULD implement configurable response suppression, enabling at least
	the following options per resource that supports multicast requests:
	
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>Suppression of all 2.xx success responses;</t>
		<t>Suppression of all 4.xx client errors;</t>

	<t>
	A number of group communication example applications are given below to illustrate
	how to make use of response suppression:
	
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>CoAP resource discovery: Suppress 2.05 responses with empty payload and all 4.xx and 5.xx errors.</t>
		<t>Lighting control: Suppress all 2.xx responses after a lighting change command.</t>
		<t>Update configuration data in a group of devices using multicast PUT: No suppression at all. The client uses collected responses
		   to identify which group members did not receive the new configuration; then attempts using CoAP CON unicast to
		   update those specific group members.</t>
		<t>Multicast firmware update by sending blocks of data: Suppress all 2.xx and 5.xx responses. After having sent
			 all multicast blocks, the client checks each endpoint by unicast to identify which data blocks are still missing
			 in each endpoint.</t>
		<t>Conditional reporting for a group (e.g., sensors) based on a URI query: Suppress all 2.05 responses with empty payload (i.e., if
				a query produces no matching results).</t>

  <section title="Congestion Control" anchor="Congestion_Control">
    <t>
    Multicast CoAP requests may result in a multitude of responses from
    different nodes, potentially causing congestion. Therefore both the sending of multicast requests,
    and the sending of the unicast CoAP responses to these multicast requests should be conservatively controlled.
    </t><t>
    CoAP <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> reduces multicast-specific congestion 
    risks through the following measures:
    
    <list style="symbols">    
      <t>A server MAY choose not to respond to a multicast request if there's nothing useful 
      to respond (e.g., error or empty response). See <xref target="ResponseSuppression"/> for 
      more detailed guidelines on response suppression.</t>
      <t>A server SHOULD limit the support for multicast requests to specific resources 
      where multicast operation is required.</t>
      <t>A multicast request MUST be Non-confirmable.</t>
      <t>A response to a multicast request SHOULD be Non-confirmable (Section 5.2.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/>).</t>
      <t>A server does not respond immediately to a multicast request, but SHOULD first wait for 
      a time that is randomly picked within a predetermined time interval called the Leisure.</t>
    </list>
    
    </t>
    <t>
    Additional guidelines to reduce congestion risks defined in this document are:   
    <list style="symbols">    
      <t>A server in an LLN should only support multicast GET for resources that are small.  For example, the 
	      payload of the response is 5% of the IP Maximum Transmit Unit (MTU) size (e.g. so it fits
	      into a single link-layer frame).</t>
      <t>A server can minimize the payload length in response to a multicast GET on "/.well-known/core" 
      by using hierarchy in arranging link descriptions for the response. An example of this is given 
      in Section 5 of <xref target="RFC6690"/>.</t>
      <t>A server can also minimize the payload length of a response to a multicast GET (e.g.,
      on "/.well-known/core") using CoAP blockwise transfers <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-block"/>,
      returning only a first block of the CoRE Link Format description.  For this reason, a CoAP client
      sending a multicast CoAP request to "/.well-known/core" SHOULD support core-block.</t>
      <t>A client should use CoAP multicast with the smallest possible multicast scope
      that fulfills the application needs. As an example, site-local scope is always preferred
      over global scope IP multicast if this fulfills the application needs.</t>

  <!-- section anchor="sec-2.9" title="Proxy Operation" -->
  <section title="Proxy Operation">
	  <t> CoAP <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> allows a client to request a forward-proxy to process
		  its CoAP request. For this purpose the client either specifies the request URI as a string in the 
		  Proxy-URI option, or it specifies the Proxy-Scheme option with the URI constructed from the
		  usual Uri-* options. This approach
		  works well for unicast requests.  However, there are certain issues and limitations of processing 
		  the (unicast) responses to a group communication request made in this manner through a proxy.</t>


	  <t>A proxy may buffer all the individual (unicast) responses to a group communication request and then
		  send back only a single (aggregated) response to the client.  However there are some issues with
		  this aggregation approach:
		  
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>Aggregation of (unicast) responses to a group communication request in a proxy is difficult.  This is
		because the proxy does not know how many members there are in the group, or how many group members
		will actually respond.  Also the proxy does not know how long to wait before deciding to send back
	       	the aggregated response to the client.</t>


		<t>There is no default format defined in CoAP for aggregation of multiple responses into a single
			 response.</t>
	</list>
	
	Alternatively, if a proxy follows directly the specification for a CoAP Proxy <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/>,
	the proxy would simply forward all the individual (unicast) responses to a group communication request
	to the client (i.e., no aggregation).  There are also issues with this approach:
  
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>The client may be confused as it may not have known that the Proxy-URI contained a multicast target.  
			That is, the client may be expecting only one (unicast) response but instead receives multiple (unicast) 
			responses potentially leading to fault conditions in the application.</t>
		<t>
			Each individual CoAP response will appear to originate (IP Source address) from the CoAP Proxy, and 
			not from the server	that produced the response. This makes it impossible for the client to identify 
			the server that	produced each response.
		</t>
	</list>
    </t>
    
    <t>
    	Due to above issues, a guideline is defined here that a CoAP Proxy SHOULD NOT support processing
    	a multicast CoAP request but rather return a 501 (Not Implemented) response in such case. The
    	exception case here (i.e., to process it) is allowed under following conditions:
    	
    	<list style="symbols">
    	<t>The CoAP Proxy MUST be explicitly configured (whitelist) to allow proxied multicast requests by  
    		specific client(s).</t>
	<t>The proxy SHOULD return individual (unicast) CoAP responses to the client (i.e., not aggregated).  
		The exception case here occurs when a (future) standardized aggregation format is being used.</t>
    	<t>It MUST be known to the person/entity doing the configuration of the proxy, or otherwise verified in
		some way, that the client configured in the whitelist supports receiving multiple responses
	       	to a proxied unicast CoAP request.</t>

    <t>Group communication using IP multicast offers improved network efficiency and latency amongst

		<t>To illustrate the use cases we define two network configurations. Both are based on

		<t>A large room (Room-A) with three lights (Light-1, Light-2, Light-3) controlled by a

		<t>Light-2 and the Light-3 are connected to another router (Rtr-2).</t>
		<t>The routers are connected to an IPv6 network backbone which is also multicast

	    		<list style="symbols">
				<t>Light-2 is installed and powered on for the first time.</t>

				       	to the site-local "All CoAP Nodes" multicast address.</t>
				<t>This multicast message will then go to each node in subnet-2.  Rtr-2 will
					then forward into to the Network Backbone where it will be received
					by the CoAP RD.  All other nodes in subnet-2 will ignore the multicast
				       	GET because it is qualified by the query string "?rt=core.rd" 
					(which indicates it should only be processed by the endpoint if it contains a resource of type core.rd).</t>
				<t>The CoAP RD will then send back a unicast response containing the requested content,

					happen for Light-1, Light-3 and the Light Switch when they are first

			The CoAP RD may also be discovered by other means such as by assuming a default location

      <t>For other discovery use cases such as discovering local CoAP servers, services or resources
      group communication can be used in a similar fashion as in the above use case. Both Link-Local (LL) and

	<section title="Lighting Control" anchor="Lighting_Control_Use_Case">	     
    <t>
	    The protocol flow for a building automation lighting control scenario
	    for the network (<xref target="Example_Topology" />) 
	    is shown in <xref target="Example_Protocol_Flow_3" />.
	    The network is assumed to be in a 6LoWPAN configuration. 
	    Also, it is assumed that the CoAP servers
	    in each Light are configured to suppress CoAP responses for any multicast CoAP requests 
	    related to lighting control. (See <xref target="ResponseSuppression"/> for more details on
	    response suppression by a server.) 
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>In addition, <xref target="Example_Protocol_Flow_4" />
	    shows a protocol flow example for the case that servers do respond to a
	    lighting control multicast request with (unicast) CoAP NON responses. 
	    There are two success responses and one 5.00
	    error response. In this particular case, the Light Switch does not check that all Lights
	    in the group received the multicast request by examining the responses.
	    This is because the Light Switch is not configured with an exhaustive
	    list of the IP addresses of all Lights belonging to the group. 
	    However, based on received error responses it could take
	    additional action such as logging a fault or alerting the user via its
	    LCD display.  In case a CoAP message is delivered multiple times to a Light,
	    the subsequent CoAP messages can be filtered out as duplicates, based on the CoAP Message ID.
          </t>
	  
	  <t>Reliability of CoAP multicast is not guaranteed. Therefore, one or more lights in the
	  	group may not have received the CoAP control request due to packet loss. In this use case
	  	there is no detection nor correction of such situations: the application layer expects 
	  	that the multicast forwarding/routing will be of sufficient quality to provide on average
	  	a very high probability of packet delivery to all CoAP endpoints in a multicast group.
	  	An example protocol to accomplish this using randomized retransmission is the MPL forwarding protocol for LLNs
	  	<xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-trickle-mcast"/>.	  
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>
	    We assume the following steps have already occurred before the illustrated flows:

    		<list style="numbers">
				<t>Startup phase:  6LoWPANs are formed.  IPv6 addresses assigned to all devices.  
					The CoAP network is formed.</t>
				<t>Network configuration (application-independent): 6LBRs are configured with
				   multicast addresses, or address blocks, to filter out or to pass through to/from the 6LoWPAN.</t>
				<t>Commissioning phase (application-related): The IP multicast address of the group 
					(Room-A-Lights) has been configured in all the Lights and in the Light Switch.</t>
				<t>As an alternative to the previous step, when a DNS server is available, the 
				 	Light Switch and/or the Lights
				  have been configured with a group hostname which each nodes resolves to the above
				  IP multicast address of the group. </t>
        </list>	
			Note for the Commissioning phase: the switch's 6LoWPAN/CoAP software stack supports sending 
		  unicast, multicast or proxied unicast CoAP requests, including processing of
		  the multiple responses that may be generated by a multicast CoAP request.

				In this case a controller connected to the Network Backbone sends a CoAP multicast request
				to turn on all lights in Room-A. Every Light sends back a CoAP response to the Controller after

    <t>
    The use case of previous section can also apply in networks where nodes support the
    MLD protocol <xref target="RFC3810" />. The Lights then 
    take on the role of MLDv2 listener and the routers (Rtr-1, Rtr-2) are MLDv2 Routers.
    In the Ethernet based network configuration, MLD may be available on all involved network
    interfaces. Use of MLD in the 6LoWPAN based configuration is also possible, but requires MLD support
    in all nodes in the 6LoWPAN. In current 6LoWPAN implementations, MLD is however not supported.  Though
    this is expected to change in the near future.
    </t><t>
    The resulting protocol flow is shown in <xref target="Example_Protocol_Flow_2"/>. This flow
    is executed after the commissioning phase, as soon as Lights are configured with a group
    address to listen to. The (unicast) MLD Reports may require periodic refresh activity as specified
    by the MLD protocol. In the figure, LL denotes Link Local communication. 
    </t><t>
    After the shown sequence of MLD Report messages has been executed, both Rtr-1 and Rtr-2
    are automatically configured to forward multicast traffic destined to Room-A-Lights onto
    their connected subnet. Hence, no manual Network Configuration of routers, as previously 
    indicated in <xref target="Lighting_Control_Use_Case"/>, is needed anymore.

		<t>
			This section outlines how devices in the lighting use case (both Switches and Lights) can
			be commissioned, making use of Resource Directory <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory"/>
			and its group configuration feature.		
		</t><t>
		Once the Resource Directory (RD) is discovered, the Switches and Lights need to be discovered
		and their groups need to be defined. For the commissioning of these devices, a commissioning
		tool can be used that defines the entries in the RD. The commissioning tool has the authority
		to change the contents of the RD and the Light/Switch nodes. DTLS based security is used by the commissioning
	       	tool to modify operational data in RD, Switches and Lights.
		</t><t>
		In our particular use case, a group of three lights is defined with one multicast address and hostname
		"Room-A-Lights.floor1.west.bldg6.example.com". The commissioning tool has a list of the three lights
		and the associated multicast address. For each light in the list the tool learns the IP address of the
		light and instructs the RD with three POST commands to store the endpoints associated with the three lights
		as prescribed by the RD specification <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory"/>.  Finally the commissioning
		tool defines the group in the RD to contain these three endpoints. Also the commissioning tool writes the multicast
	       	address in the Light endpoints with, for example, the POST /gp command discussed in <xref target="ConfiguringMembersPOST"/>.
		</t><t>
		The light switch can discover the group in RD and thus learn the multicast address of the group. The light
		switch will use this address to send multicast commands to the members of the group. When the message
	  arrives the Lights should recognize the multicast address and accept the message.

   <t>
   This section provides guidelines how IP Multicast based 
   CoAP group communication can be deployed in various network configurations.  
   </t>


	<!-- section anchor="sec-4.1" title="Target Network Topologies" -->   
	<section title="Target Network Topologies">
		<t>
		CoAP group communication can be deployed in various network topologies. First, the
		target network may be a regular IP network, or a LLN such as a 6LoWPAN network, or 
		consist of mixed regular/constrained network segments.
		Second, it may be a single subnet only or multi-subnet; e.g., multiple 6LoWPAN 
		networks joined by a single backbone LAN. Third, a wireless network segment may have all its
		nodes reachable in a single IP hop (fully connected), or it may require multiple IP hops for 
		some pairs of nodes to reach each other.
		</t><t>
		Each topology may pose different requirements on the configuration of routers and protocol(s),
		in order to enable efficient CoAP group communication. To enable all the above target
		network topologies, an implementation of CoAP group communication needs to allow:
		<list style="numbers">
			<t>Routing/forwarding of IP multicast packets over multiple hops</t>
			<t>Routing/forwarding of IP multicast packets over subnet boundaries between regular
				 and constrained (e.g. LLN) networks.</t>
		</list>
		The remainder of this section discusses solutions to enable this.
		</t>
	</section>
	

  <!-- section anchor="sec-4.2.1" title="Using the MLD Protocol" -->
  <section title="Networks Using the MLD Protocol" anchor="deploy_mld">
    <t>
    CoAP nodes that are IP hosts (i.e., not IP routers) are generally unaware of the specific multicast 
    routing/forwarding protocol being used. When such a host needs to join a specific (CoAP) multicast 
    group, it requires a way to signal to multicast routers which multicast traffic it wants to receive. 
    </t>
    <t>
    The Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) protocol <xref target="RFC3810" /> (see <xref target="mld"/>)
    is the standard IPv6 method to achieve this; therefore this approach should be used on regular
    IP networks. CoAP server nodes would then act in the role of MLD Multicast Address Listener.
    </t>
    <t>
    The guidelines from <xref target="RFC6636"/> on tuning of MLD
    for mobile and wireless networks may be useful when implementing MLD in LLNs.
    However, on LLNs and 6LoWPAN networks the use of MLD may not be feasible at all due to constraints
    on code size, memory, or network capacity.
  	</t>
  </section>

  <!-- section anchor="sec-4.2.2" title="Using RPL Multicast" -->
  <section title="Networks Using RPL Multicast Without MLD"  anchor="deploy_rpl">
    <t>
    It is assumed in this section that the MLD protocol is not implemented in a network,
    for example due to resource constraints.
    The RPL routing protocol (see Section 12 of <xref target="RFC6550"/>) defines the 
    advertisement of IP multicast destinations using DAO messages and routing of multicast
    IP packets based on this. 
    It requires the RPL Mode of Operation (MOP) to be 3 (Storing Mode with multicast support).    
    </t><t>
    Hence, RPL DAO can be used by CoAP nodes 
    to advertise IP multicast group membership to parent routers. Then, the RPL protocol is 
    used to route multicast CoAP requests over multiple hops to the correct CoAP servers.
    </t><t>
    The same mechanism can be used to convey IP multicast group membership
    information to an edge router (e.g., 6LBR), in case the edge router is also the root
    of the RPL DODAG. This is useful because 
    the edge router then learns which IP multicast traffic it needs to pass through from
    the backbone network into the LLN subnet. 
    In 6LoWPAN networks, such selective "filtering" may avoid congestion of a 6LoWPAN subnet 
    by IP multicast traffic from the regular backbone network.
    </t>
	</section>

  <!-- section anchor="sec-4.2.3" title="Using the MPL Forwarding Protocol" -->
    <section title="Networks Using MPL Forwarding Without MLD" anchor="deploy_mpl">
		<t>
		The MPL forwarding protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-trickle-mcast" /> can be used 
		for propagation of IP multicast packets to all MPL Forwarders within a predefined network domain, over
		multiple hops. MPL is designed to work in LLNs. In this section it is again assumed
		that the MLD protocol is not implemented in the network, for example due to resource
		limitations in an LLN.
		</t><t>
		In a typical use of MPL, all nodes in an LLN are MPL Forwarders. So it would appear there is
		no need for CoAP servers to advertise their multicast group membership, since any IP
		multicast packet that enters the MPL Domain is distributed to all MPL Forwarders without regard
		to what multicast addresses the individual nodes are listening to. 
		</t><t>
		However, if an IP multicast request originates outside the MPL Domain, this request will
		by default not be propagated by MPL to the CoAP server(s) within the MPL Domain that need to receive it.
		This situation can become a problem in building control use cases. For example, in a network
		topology of <xref target="Example_Topology" /> where the Subnets are 6LoWPAN subnets and
		per 6LoWPAN subnet one Realm-Local MPL Domain is defined.	Suppose that the Controller Client needs to send a
		single CoAP multicast request to group Room-A-Lights. By default, the request would be blocked
		by Rtr-1 and by Rtr-2, and not enter the Realm-Local MPL Domains associated to Subnet-1 and Subnet-2. The
		reason is that Rtr-1 and Rtr-2 do not have the knowledge that devices in Subnet-1/2 want to 
		listen for IP packets destined to multicast group Room-A-Lights.
		</t><t>
		To solve the above issue, the following solutions could be applied:
		<list style="numbers">
			<t>Extend the MPL Domain (e.g. in above example, include the Network Backbone in the MPL Domain)</t>
			<t>Manual configuration of routers (e.g. in above example, configure Rtr-1 and Rtr-2 with a whitelist
				to pass through certain multicast traffic based on IP destination address range(s). Or configure the routers
				to pass through all multicast traffic.)</t>				
			<t>Use an additional protocol for injection of multicast traffic from outside an MPL Domain into 
				the MPL Domain. Such protocol is currently not defined in IETF and outside scope of 
				<xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-trickle-mcast" />.</t>
		</list>
		</t><t>
		Concluding, MPL can be used directly in case all sources of multicast CoAP requests (CoAP clients) and also 
		all the destinations
		(CoAP servers) are inside a single MPL Domain. Then, each source node acts as an MPL Seed.
		In all other cases, MPL can only be used with additional protocols and/or configuration.

		  <t>
		   To support multi-subnet scenarios for CoAP group communication,
		   it is recommended that a 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR) will act in an
		   MLD Router role on the backbone link.  If this is not possible then
		   the 6LBR should be configured to act as an MLD Multicast Address
		   Listener (see <xref target="mld"/>) on the backbone link.

  <!-- section anchor="Appendix A" title="Multicast Listener Discovery" -->
  <section anchor="mld" title="Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)">
  	<t>
  	In order to extend the scope of IP multicast beyond link-local scope, an IP multicast 
  	routing or forwarding protocol has to be active in routers on an LLN. To achieve efficient 
  	multicast routing (i.e., avoid always flooding IP multicast packets), routers
  	have to learn which hosts need to receive packets addressed to specific IP multicast 
  	destinations.
  	</t><t>
  	The Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) protocol <xref target="RFC3810" /> 
  	(or its IPv4 equivalent IGMP <xref target="RFC3376" />) is today the method of choice used by an 
  	(IP multicast enabled) router to discover 
  	the presence of multicast listeners on directly attached links, and to 
  	discover which multicast addresses are of interest to those listening nodes. MLD 
  	was specifically designed to cope with fairly dynamic situations in which multicast
  	listeners may join and leave at any time.
  	</t><t>
	<xref target="RFC6636"/> discusses optimal tuning of the parameters of MLD/IGMP for routers
       	for mobile and wireless	networks. These guidelines may be useful when implementing MLD in LLNs.

     <t>Changes from ietf-06 to ietf-07:
	     <list style="symbols">
	     <t>Added an IANA request (in section 7.2) for a dedicated content-format (Internet Media type) for the group management
		     JSON format called 'application/coap-group+json' (#299).</t>
	     <t>Clarified semantics (in section 3.6) of group management JSON format (#300).</t>
	     <t>Added details of IANA request (in section 7.1) for a new CORE Resource Type called 'core.gp'.</t>
	     <t>Clarified that DELETE method (in section 3.6) is also a valid group management operation.</t>
	     <t>Various editorial updates for improved readability.</t>
	     </list>
     </t>

     <t>Changes from ietf-05 to ietf-06:
	     <list style="symbols">
	     <t>Added a new section on commissioning flow when using discovery services when end devices discover
	     	  in which multicast group they are allocated (#295).</t>
	     <t>Added a new section on CoAP Proxy Operation (section 3.9) that outlines the potential issues and limitations of
			    doing CoAP multicast requests via a CoAP Proxy (#274).</t>
			 <t>Added use case of multicasting controller on the backbone (#279).</t>
	     <t>Use cases were updated to show only a single CoAP RD (to replace the previous multiple RDs with one in each subnet).  
		     This is a more efficient deployment and also avoids RD specific issues such as synchronization
		     of RD information between serves (#280).</t>
	     <t>Added text to section 3.6 (Configuring Group Membership in Endpoints) that clarified that any (unicast) operation to
		     change an endpoint's group membership must use DTLS-secured CoAP.</t>
	     <t>Clarified relationship of this document to <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> in section 2.2 (Scope).</t>
	     <t>Removed IPSec related requirement, as IPSec is not part of <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> anymore.</t>
	     <t>Editorial reordering of subsections in section 3 to have a better flow of topics.  Also renamed some of the
		     (sub)sections to better reflect their content.  Finally, moved the URI Configuration text to the same
		     section as the Port Configuration section as it was a more natural grouping (now in section 3.3) .</t>
	     <t>Editorial rewording of section 3.7 (Multicast Request Acceptance and Response Suppression) to make
		     the logic easier to comprehend (parse).</t>
	     <t>Various editorial updates for improved readability.</t>
	     </list>
     </t>

     <t>Changes from ietf-04 to ietf-05:
	     <list style="symbols">
	     <t>Added a new section 3.9 (Exceptions) that highlights that IP multicast (and hence group communication)
		     is not always available (#187).</t>
	     <t>Updated text on the use of <xref target="RFC2119"/> language (#271) in Section 1.</t>
	     <t>Included guidelines on when (not) to use CoAP responses to multicast requests and when 
	        (not) to accept multicast requests (#273).</t>
	     <t>Added guideline on use of core-block for minimizing response size (#275).</t>
	     <t>Restructured section 6 (Security Considerations) to more fully describe threats and threat mitigation (#277).</t>
	     <t>Clearly indicated that DNS resolution and reverse DNS lookup are optional.</t>
	     <t>Removed confusing text about a single group having multiple IP addresses.  If multiple IP addresses
		     are required then multiple groups (with the same members) should be created.</t>
	     <t>Removed repetitive text about the fact that group communication is not guaranteed.</t>
	     <t>Merged previous section 5.2 (Multicast Routing) into 3.1 (IP Multicast Routing Background) and added
		     link to section 5.2 (Advertising Membership of Multicast Groups).</t>
	     <t>Clarified text in section 3.8 (Congestion Control) regarding precedence of use of IP 
		     multicast domains (i.e. first try to use link-local scope, then site-local scope,
		     and only use global IP multicast as a last resort).</t>
	     <t>Extended group resource manipulation guidelines with use of pre-configured ports/paths
		     for the multicast group.</t>
	     <t>Consolidated all text relating to ports in a new section 3.3 (Port Configuration).</t>
	     <t>Clarified that all methods (GET/PUT/POST) for configuring group membership in endpoints
		     should be unicast (and not multicast) in section 3.7 (Configuring Group Membership
		     In Endpoints).</t>
	     <t>Various editorial updates for improved readability, including editorial comments by Peter
		     van der Stok to WG list of December 18th, 2012.</t>
	     </list>
     </t>

     <t>Changes from ietf-03 to ietf-04:
	     <list style="symbols">
	     <t>Removed section 2.3 (Potential Solutions for Group Communication) as it is
		     purely background information and moved section to draft-dijk-core-groupcomm-misc (#266).</t>
	     <t>Added reference to draft-keoh-tls-multicast-security to section 6 (Security Considerations).</t>
	     <t>Removed Appendix B (CoAP-Observe Alternative to Group Communications) as it is
		     as an alternative to IP Multicast that the WG has not adopted and moved section
		     to draft-dijk-core-groupcomm-misc (#267).</t>
	     <t>Deleted section 8 (Conclusions) as it is redundant (#268).</t>
	     <t>Simplified light switch use case (#269) by splitting into basic operations and additional
		     functions (#269).</t>
	     <t>Moved section 3.7 (CoAP Multicast and HTTP Unicast Interworking) to draft-dijk-core-groupcomm-misc
		     (#270).</t>
	     <t>Moved section 3.3.1 (DNS-SD) and 3.3.2 (CoRE Resource Directory) to draft-dijk-core-groupcomm-misc as
		     these sections essentially just repeated text from other drafts regarding DNS based features.
		     Clarified remaining text in this draft relating to DNS based features to clearly indicate
		     that these features are optional (#272).</t>
	     <t>Focus section 3.5 (Configuring Group Membership) on a single proposed solution.</t>
	     <t>Scope of section 5.3 (Use of MLD) widened to multicast destination advertisement methods
		     in general.</t>
	     <t>Rewrote section 2.2 (Scope) for improved readability.</t>
	     <t>Moved use cases that are not addressed to draft-dijk-core-groupcomm-misc.</t>

		     and unsuccessful responses (section 3.4 and Figure 6) (#251).</t>

	     <t>Added mechanism for group membership configuration (#249).</t>
	     <t>Removed IANA request for multicast addresses (section 7) and replaced with a note
		     indicating that the request is being made in <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> (#248).</t>
	     <t>Made the definition of 'group' more specific to group of CoAP endpoints and included
		     text on UDP port selection  (#186).</t>
	     <t>Added explanatory text in section 3.4 regarding why not to use group communication
		     for non-idempotent messages (i.e. CoAP POST) (#186).</t>
	     <t>Changed link-local RD discovery to site-local in RD discovery use case to make it
		     more realistic.</t>
	     <t>Fixed lighting control use case CoAP proxying; now returns individual CoAP responses
		     as in coap-12.</t>  
	     <t>Replaced link format I-D with RFC6690 reference.</t>
