                       Route Leaks -- Definitions
                  draft-dickson-sidr-route-leak-def-03

Abstract

   The Border Gateway Protocol, version 4, (BGP4) provides the means to
   advertise reachability for IP prefixes.  This reachability
   information is propagated in a peer-to-peer topology.  Routes may be
   announced to neighbors, contrary to the receiver's local peering
   policy.  If that occurs, those routes may then be propagated
   indiscriminantly, once they have been accepted.

   This document considers the situations that can lead to routes being
   leaked, and tries to find acceptable definitions for describing these
   scenarios.

   The purpose of these definitions is to facilitate analysis of what a
   route leak is, and what the scope of the problem space for route
   leaks is.

   This, in turn, is intended to inform a requirements document for
   detection of (and prevention of) route leaks.  And finally, the
   definitions and requirements are intended to allow proposed solutions
   which meet these criteria, and to facilitate evaluation of proposed
   solutions.

   The ultimate goal is to "solve the route leaks problem".

Internet-Draft           Route Leak Definitions             October 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Assumptions

   Much of this document assumes the observer has total knowledge of the
   state of everything in the hypothetical examples presented.

   It is understood that participants in the real world routing
   scenarios will not have that knowledge.

   The purpose of presuming that total knowledge here, is to illustrate
   how little is needed to identify leaked routes.

   In particular, it is hoped that this leads to a correspondingly
   simple set of definitions with useful real-world meaning.

1.2.  Rationale

   Generally speaking, a route-leak occurs when a route goes somewhere
   it should not.  In other words, that somewhere along the path, a
   route was sent that somehow violated the implicit or explicit policy
   between two neighbors, without being blocked by the recipient.  Route
   leaks cause harm, in a variety of ways.  They expose traffic to Man-
   In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks.  They may result in traffic congestion,
   latency, or even black-holing of traffic.

   It is a leak if any receiver in the propogation path did not want the
   route, from a generic policy perspective.  It does not matter which
   party caused the situation - a leaks are in the eye of the receivers.
   By their nature - unintentional, unwanted, and harmful - route leaks
   are bad.

   By first establishing a more precise definition of route leak, the
   intent is to find requirements for mechanisms for stopping route
   leaks, and then finding solutions that meet those requirements.

1.3.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.4.  Terminology

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with BGP version 4, both from a
   protocol perspective and from an operational perspective.  BGP4 is
   defined in [RFC1771], and updated or enhanced by a variety of other
   RFCs.

Internet-Draft           Route Leak Definitions             October 2012


   The following additional terminology is used throughout this
   document:

   Route (or synonomously, prefix): an NLRI in BGP, including all its
   attributes.  (This term subject to change by GROW.)

   Neighbor (or "peer", not capitalized): A toplogically adjacent
   Autonomous System, with whom routes are exchanged.

   Link: A BGP connection to a Neighbor.  A Neighbor may be reached via
   one or more links, where each link may have a different
   classification, and/or local policy.

   Link Classification: The "intent" of a given BGP peering session,
   which addresses only the categories of route announced and accepted,
   and which is further modified by Local Policy.

   Local Policy: The set of rules, as applied on a single Neighbor Link,
   specifying which routes are announced, which routes are accepted, and
   what attributes are changed to affect choice of BGP Best Path per
   prefix.

   Path: Also known as AS_PATH (or optionally AS4_PATH), the sequence of
   ASNs through which a route has passed from Originator to recipient.

   Hijacked Route: A route which has been originated by a party other
   than the owner of the prefix.  This could be via a forged ASN, or
   from another ASN.

   Validated Origination: a route whose origination has been validated,
   e.g. via cryptographic means, such as using an ROA.


2.  Scope Limitations

   The following issues are not in the scope of route leaks.  Each item
   in the list includes the rationale for excluding it.
   o  Hijacked Routes - Origin Validation (proposed work in the SIDR WG)
      addresses the issue of Hijacked Routes.  By limiting Route Leak
      efforts to Validated Routes, we are able to presume the origin is
      correct, and narrow the scope.
   o  Violations of Local Policy - issues between adjacent ASNs which do
      not propogate any further, or which do not violate the Link
      Classification.
   o  Other-ASN Relationship - The "correctness" of a given prefix
      received over a Link, is determined only by the Link
      Classifications of each Link in the Path.  The existence of other
      Links, to Neighbors with ASNs on a given Path (which may have

Internet-Draft           Route Leak Definitions             October 2012


      differing Link Classifications), is a classic "apples to oranges"
      comparision.  It is incorrect to compare ASNs outside the context
      of the AS path, so we exclude those comparisons from this work.
   Essentially, the only elements being considered are the Path, and
   Link Classifications at each hop in the Path.


3.  Route Leak Definitions

   Route Leak Initiation: A Route announced over a Link by a Neighbor,
   which does not match the Link Classification, where one of the
   following is true:
   o  the Neighbor is the Originator
   o  the Neighbor received the Route, where the received Route was not
      a Route Leak
   In lay terms, this means that the Neighbor is the party that caused
   the route leak, by announcing a route contrary to the Link
   Classification (and consequently also violated the Local Policy).

   Route Leak Propagation: A Route announced over a Link by a Neighbor,
   where the Route that the Neighbor received was either a Route Leak
   Initiation, or a Route Leak Propagation.

   Once a Route has become a Route Leak Initiation, any further
   announcement of that Route is a Route Leak Propagation.

   NB: A Route Leak Propagation may appear to match the Link
   Classification, since the Path appears similar to non-leaked routes
   for the first two ASNs in the Path.

   Link Classifications: a Link may be classified as:
   o  Customer
   o  Transit
   o  Peer
   o  Special (which includes Mutual Transit, Sibling, and other non-
      trivial arrangements)

   Special (e.g.  Mutual Transit): a Link where the two parties agree to
   provide full routes, and to advertise each others' customers routes
   the same as they would advertise their own customers' routes.
   Semantically, this behaves the same as having two parallel Links
   between the same two Neighbors, where one Link Policy is Transit and
   the other Link Policy is Customer.  Recall, Link Classification is
   the superset of Local Policy - the term "full routes" here means
   simply that any route in addition to customers' routes, is permitted.

4.  Peer Links and Routes

   A Peer Classification is a Link over which the two parties send ONLY
   their respective Customer Routes (and their Customer's Routes, and so
   on).

   A Link which is classified as a Peer, will see us as a Peer
   Classification as well.  The relationship is symmetric in nature.


5.  Customer Links and Routes

   A Customer Link Classification: The Customer sends us only their own
   (locally originated) Routes, and the Customer's Customer's Routes
   (and Customer^Nth Routes).  The Customer relationship is transitive.

   A Transit Link Classification: The Transit provider sends all Routes.
   This include the Transit Provider's Customers, the Transit Provider's
   Peers, and if there are any, the Transit Provider's Transit
   Provider's Routes.  The Transit Provider relationship is also
   transitive.

   Transit and Customer are the opposite ends of the same Link, by
   definition.

   The Transit Link Classification is a superset of the actual Local
   Policy of a specific Customer.  This means that while a Transit Link
   Classification means "we send all routes", the actual Local Policy
   for a specific Customer might differ, and the Customer might only
   receive some Routes, or none at all.  Similarly, the Classification
   means that we are prepared to accept the Customer's own Routes, as
   well as those of the Customer's Customers.  However, the Local Policy
   might be to accept only a specific subset of the Customer's Routes.


5.1.  Customer's Customer

   It is important to define when a Route is a Customer's Customer
   Route.

   A Customer's Customer Route: the Path to be from the Customer's
   Customer, to the Customer, to us.  Similarly, Customer^Nth Paths must
   proceed directly from Customer^N to Customer^(N-1) to Customer to us.
   It is not sufficient for the Origin of the Route to be the ASN of a
   Customer's Customer.  Each Link must be a Customer Classification (or
   Special, e.g.  Mutual Transit, which is a superset of Customer).

   In particular, if the Path were to include any Link which were not a

Internet-Draft           Route Leak Definitions             October 2012


   Customer Link, the Route would NOT be a Customer^N.

   NB: It is sufficient that the Customer's Customer relationship is
   declared.  The "Customer" relationship, in the context of route
   leaks, is restrictive.  Erroneous or inadvertent classification as
   Customer cannot result in a route leak.


6.  Non-Leak-Initiation Links

   To help identify the exact conditions where a Route Leak Initiation
   can occur, it is helpful to exclude Link Classifications where it is
   axiomatically impossible to cause a Route Leak Initiation.

   Since a Transit Classification, by definition, can receive all
   routes, a Transit Link cannot be the source of a Route Leak
   Initiation.  By the same logic, a Special (e.g.  Mutual Transit)
   Classification cannot be the source of a Route Leak Initiation.

   This leads to a more precise definition of a Route Leak Initiation.


7.  Route Leak Initiation

   Route Leak Initiation: A Non-Customer Route which is received over a
   Peer or Customer Link.


8.  Route Leak

   Route Leak: any Route where, somewhere in the Path, a Non-Customer
   Route was received over a Peer or Customer Link.  (This is synomous
   with "was sent over a Peer or Transit Link".)

   It should be observed that a route which is not a route leak, has an
   as-path that matches the following pattern:

   {C|S}*P?{T|S}*

   Where C is Customer, T is Transit, P is Peer, and S is Special, and
   "{ | }" denotes either/or, "*" means zero or more occurrences of, and
   "?" means zero or one occurrences of.


9.  Security Considerations

   None per se.
