Abstract

   Multiple virtual machines (VMs) created in a single physical platform
   greatly improve the efficiency of data centers by enabling more work
   from less hardware.  VMs have their lifecycles from VM creation, VM
   Startup to VM deletion.  The VMs may also move across the
   participating virtualization hosts (e.g., the virtualization server,
   hypervisor).  This document discusses how VMs are managed and desired
   signaling functionalities for VM management.

1.  Introduction

   Multiple virtual machines (VMs) created in a single physical platform
   greatly improve the efficiency of data centers by enabling more work
   from less hardware.  VMs have their lifecycles from VM creation, VM
   startup to VM deletion.  The VMs may also move across the
   participating virtualization hosts (e.g., the virtualization server
   or hypervisor).  One example is, as the workload on one physical
   server increases or physical server needs upgrade, VMs can be moved
   to other available lightweight-workload servers to ensure that
   service level agreement and response time requirements are met.  We
   call this VM movement or relocation as VM migration.  When the
   workload decreases, the VMs can be moved back, allowing the unused
   server powered off to save cost and energy.  Another example is as
   one tenant moves, VMs associated with this tenant may also move to
   the place that is more close to the tenant and provides better user
   experience (e.g., larger bandwidth with lower latency).  We call such
   movements as VM mobility.  VM migration refers to the transfer of a
   VM image including memory, storage and network connectivity while VM
   mobility refers to sending data to the moving tenant associated with
   the VM and emphasizes service non-disruption during a tenant's
   movement.  This document advocates the distinction between VM
   mobility and VM migration, both important notions in VM management.
   The implication is that different signaling or protocols for VM
   mobility and VM migration might be chosen to automate Network
   Management for VM Movement, thus possibly reusing the existing
   protocols or schemes to manage VM migration and VM mobility
   separately.  Unfortunately we sometimes mixed them up or don't
   distinct VM migration management from VM mobility management and
   intend to utilize one common protocol to support both VM migration
   and VM mobility, which seems to simplify the overall protocol design
   but it is difficult or impossible to run one such protocol across
   both VM mobility management system that manages VM mobility and VM
   management platform that manages VM attributes.

   This document discusses how VMs are managed, signaling for VM
   management and argues VMs need management functionality support but
   can be managed without VM mobility functionality support.

3.  Discussions

3.1.  VM awareness and VM movement awareness

   Virtual machines usually operate under the control of a server
   virtualization software residing on the physical compute server.  The
   server virtualization software is commonly referred to as
   'hypervisor'.  The hypervisor is the container of the VM and provides
   shared compute/memory/storage and network connectivity to each VM
   that it hosts.  Therefore the hypervisor or the virtualized server
   MUST be aware of VMs that it hosts.  However it should not be aware
   of VMs that it doesn't host.  When VMs hosted in different
   virtualization servers need to communicate each other, packets from
   one VM will be forwarded by a virtual switch within the
   virtualization server or the hypervisor to other VMs on another
   virtualization server.  Since the virtual switch resides within the
   hypervisor or virtualization server, the rule on VM awareness applied
   to the hypervisor should apply to virtual switch too.

   Unlike VM awareness, VM movement awareness is the capability of
   knowing the location update of the VM.  For example, when a VM moves
   out of the hypervisor and goes to another host, the original
   hypervisor that hosts the VM is aware of VM movement or location
   changing but may not be able to keep track of the new location after
   the VM moves.  Therefore one external party that maintains the
   mapping between the VM's identity and the VM's current location is
   needed which keeps track VM movements.

3.2.  Why VM migration

   VM migration refers to VM movement within a virtual environment in
   response to events,conditions or based on requirements.  The events
   or conditions could be, for example, very high workloads experienced
   by the VMs or upgrades of the physical server or virtualization
   server, load balancing between virtualization servers.  The
   requirements could be, for example,low power and low cost
   requirements or service continuity requirement.  When a VM is moved
   without service disruption, we usually call this VM movement as VM
   mobility.  However it is very difficult to provide transparent VM
   mobility support since it not only needs to keep connection
   uninterrupted but also needs to move the whole VM image from one
   place to another place, which may take a long down time (e.g., more
   than 400 ms) and can be noticed by the end user.

   Fortunately, VMs may be migrated without VM mobility support.  For
   example, a server manager or administrator can move a running virtual
   machine or application between different physical machines without
   disconnecting the client or application if the client or application



Schott, et al.           Expires April 15, 2013                 [Page 5]

   supports VM suspending and resuming operation or stopped at the
   source before the movement and restart at the destination after
   movement.

   In some case when VM mobility is really needed, it is recommended
   that one copy of VM SHOULD be replicated from the source to the
   destination and during VM replication, thus the VM running on the
   source should not be affected.  When VM replication to the
   destination completes and the VM on the destination restarts, the VM
   on the source can be stopped.  However how the VM on the destination
   coordinates with the VM on the source to know whom the latter is
   communicating with is a challenging issue.

3.3.  Who manages VM

   To ensure the quality of applications (e.g., real-time applications)
   or provide the same service level agreement, the VM's state(i.e., the
   network attributes and policies associated with the VM ) should be
   moved with the VM as well when the VM moves across participating
   virtualization hosts (e.g., virtualization server or hypervisor).
   These network attributes associated with VM should be enforced on the
   physical switch and the virtual switch corresponding to VM to avoid
   security and access threats.  The hypervisor or the virtualization
   server may maintain the network attributes for each VM.  However when
   VMs are moved from the previous server to the new server, the old
   server and the new server may have no means to find each other.
   Therefore one external party called VM network management system
   (e.g., Cloud Broker) is needed and should get involved to coordinate
   between the old server and the new server to establish the
   association between network attributes/policies and the VM's
   identity.  If the VM management system does not span across data
   center and the VM is moved between data centers, the VM network
   management system in one data center may also need to coordinate with
   VM network management system in another data center.

3.4.  VM Grouping

   VM grouping significantly simplifies the administration tasks when
   managing large numbers of virtual machines, as new VMs are simply
   added to existing groups.  With grouping, similar VMs can be grouped
   together and assigned with the same networking policies to all
   members of the group to ensure consistent allocation of resources and
   security measures to meet service level goals.  Members of the group
   retain the group attributes wherever they are located or move within
   the virtual environment, providing a basis for dynamic policy
   assignments.  VM groups can be maintained or distributed on the
   virtualization server or can be maintained on a centralized place,
   e.g., the VM management platform that manages all the virtualization



Schott, et al.           Expires April 15, 2013                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                VM management                 October 2012


   servers in the data center.  VM groups maintained on each
   virtualization server may change at any time due to various VM
   operations (e.g., VM adding, VM removing, VM moving).  Therefore VM
   groups need to be synchronized with the central VM management
   platform.  Profiles containing network configurations such as VLAN,
   traffic shaping and ACLs for VM groups can be automatically
   synchronized to the central VM management platform as well.  This
   way, consistent network policies can be enforced regardless of the
   VM's location.

3.5.  What VM information should be managed

   The ability to identify VMs within the physical hosts is very
   important.  With the ability to identify each VM uniquely, the
   administrator can apply the same philosophy to VMs as used with
   physical servers.  VLAN and QoS settings can be provisioned and ACL
   attributes can be set at a VM level with permit and deny actions
   based on layer 2 to layer 4 information.  In the VM environment, a VM
   is usually identified by MAC or IP address and owned by the tenant.
   Typically, the tenant not only owns the VM but also owns one or
   several virtual networks, while one VM only belongs to one tenant.
   Furthermore, one tenant may own a group of VMs in one virtual network
   or several groups of VMs distributed in multiple virtual networks.
   On the request of the tenant, a VM can be added, removed and moved by
   the virtualization server or the hypervisor.  When the VM moves, the
   network attributes or configuration attributes associated with the VM
   should also be moved with the VM as well to ensure that the service
   level agreement and response times are met.  These network attributes
   include access and tunnel policies and (L2 and/or L3) forwarding
   functions and should be part of VM information.  We use Virtual
   Network Instance ID to represent those network attributes.  One
   virtual network has at least one Virtual Network Instance ID.
   Therefore each VM should at least include the following information:

   o  VM MAC/IP address

   o  Virtual Network Instance ID

   o  Virtual Network Identifier

   o  Tenant ID

   Additional information optionally includes Group ID and Server ID.

   Editor Notes: It is more desirable to use TLV or a figure to describe
   the structure of VM information.  The current structure seems not
   representing the embededness relationship of a VM within a Server or
   Virtual Network,nor indication of server ID.  How many occurrences of

Internet-Draft                VM management                 October 2012


   each field could be.  Also which combination uniquely identifies a
   VM?  We should make it clear here.

3.6.  Who Triggers or Controls VM Movements

   VM can be moved within the virtual environment in response to events
   or conditions.  An issue here is who triggers and controls VM
   movement?  In a small scale or large scale data center, the server
   administrator is usually not aware of VM movement and may respond
   quickly to system fault or server overload and move a virtual machine
   or a group of VMs to different physical machines.  However it is hard
   for the server administrator to response to dynamic VM movement and
   creation since he doesn't keep track of VM movements.

   In large scale data centers, the server administrator or VM network
   administrator may be more hesitated to utilize VM movements because
   of the time demands of managing the related networking requirements.
   Therefore automated solutions that safely create and move virtual
   machines and free VM network or Server administrators from their
   responsibilities is highly required.

   The external party (i.e., the VM management platform) is needed to
   play the role of server administrator and should support keeping
   track of VM movement and response quickly to dynamic VM creation and
   movement.

   When one tenant moves from one place to another place, VM movement
   associated tenant should be informed to the VM management platform.
   When one tenant requests to improve the quality of application and
   shorten the response time, the VM management platform can trigger VM
   being moved to the server that is closer to the user.

3.7.  VM Monitoring

   In order to sort out bad VMs, VM monitoring is very important.  The
   VM monitor mechanism keeps track of the availability of VMs and their
   resource entitlements.  It ensures that there is no overloading of
   resources whereby many service requests cannot be simultaneously
   fulfilled due to limited resource available.  VM monitor is also
   useful for server administrations and report thstatus information of
   VMs or VM groups in each server to the VM management system.

4.  General Reference Model

   We envision the VM management reference model to consist of vServers
   (virtualization servers) and vCenters (the aforementioned VM
   management platform).  One vCenter may be placed in each data center
   and manage all the vServers in that data center.  Also, one vCenter
   may be placed in the central place; it either directly manages a
   large number of vServers distributed in each data center, or
   indirectly manages the vServers distributed in each data center by
   coordinating with local vCenter in each datacenter.  The vServer
   connects to NVE Edge in its own data center either directly or via a
   switched network (typically Ethernet).

4.1.  vServer

   system.

4.2.  vCenter

   The vCenter manages vServer and maintains not only vServer
   configurations such as vServer name, vServer MAC/IP address but also
   VM configurations for each tenant end system associated with that
   vServer.

5.  Signaling between Server and vCenter

5.1.  VM Configuration Registration

   When a VM is created in the vServer, the vServer may create profile
   for this VM containing VM identity, ACL and QoS parameter and
   registers the VM configuration associated with the tenant to the
   vCenter.  Upon receiving such a registration request, vCenter should
   check if it has already established profile for the corresponding VM:
   if yes, vCenter should update the existing profile for that VM,
   otherwise vCenter should create a new profile for the VM.

5.2.  VM Configuration Deregistration

   When a VM is removed from the vServer, the vServer may remove profile
   for this VM containing VM identity, ACL and QoS parameter and
   deregisters the VM configuration associated with the tenant to the
   vCenter.  Upon receiving such a deregistration request, vCenter
   should check if it has already established profile for that VM: if
   yes, vCenter should remove the existing profile for that VM,
   otherwise other vCenter should report alert to the vServer.

5.3.  VM Group Synchronization

   When a large number of VMs are created in one vServer and share the
   same networking policy, the vSever may create a profile for a group
   of these VMs and send a bulk registration request containing the
   group identifier and associated profile to the vCenter.  Upon
   receiving such a bulk registration request, vCenter should create or
   update the profile for a group of these VMs.

5.4.  Virtualization Server Lookup/Discovery

   When a VM is moved from one vServer and added to the current vServer,
   the current vServer should check with vCenter based on VM identity to
   see if the profile for that VM already exists and which server
   maintains that VM configuration.  If yes, vCenter should reply to the
   current vServer with the vServer's address or name from which the VM
   is moved.

5.5.  VM Relocation

   When vCenter is triggered to move one VM or a group of VMs from one
   source vServer to another destination vServer, the vCenter should
   send a VM relocation request to both vServers and updates its profile
   to indicate the new vServer that maintains the VM configuration for
   that VM or a group of those VMs.  The relocation request will trigger
   the VM image to be moved from the source vServer to the destination

   vServer.

5.6.  VM Replication

   One tenant moves between vServers or between data centers and may, as
   the internet user, want to access applications via the VM without
   service disruption.  In order to achieve this, he can choose to
   access applications via the same VM without moving the VM when he
   moves.  However, the VM he is using may be far away from where he
   stays.  In order to provide better user experience, the tenant may
   request vCenter to move VM to the vServer that is more close to where
   he stays and keeps the service uninterrupted.  In such case, the
   tenant may request vServer that hosts the original VM to interact
   with the vCenter, chooses one vServer that is closer to him and moves
   one copy of the VM image to the destination vServer.

5.7.  VM Report

   When one VM is created, moved, added, removed from the vServer, the
   VM monitor should be enabled to report the status information and
   resource availability of that VM to the vCenter.  In this case,
   vCenter can know which server is overloaded, which server is unused
   or least used.

6.  Signaling between vCenters

   When one vCenter cannot interact with the vServers distributed in
   multiple data centers, vCenter in the central place may interact with
   local vCenter in each location and signaling VMs operation that is
   applied between vServer and vCenter to the corresponding vServers
   through local vCenter in each data center.

7.  Signaling between vServers

   For sigaling between vServers helps moving VM from one physical
   server to another, one way is to let vServers interact with the
   corresponding Network Virtualization Edges (NVE)[ I.D-ietf-nvo3-
   framework] that are connecting to vServers and copy VM memory to the
   destination vServer through the tunnel established between NVEs.

8.  Security Considerations

   Threats may arise when VMs move into a hostile VM environment, e.g.,
   when the VM identity is exploited by adversaries to launch denial of
   service or Phishing attacks[Phishing].  Further details are to be
   explored in the future version of this document.
