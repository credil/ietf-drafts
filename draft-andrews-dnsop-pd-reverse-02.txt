Internet-Draft       IP6.ARPA with Prefix Delegation       November 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a method to automate the delegation of
   IP6.ARPA reverse zones when performing Prefix Delegations.

   This will allow home users and small businesses to have IP6.ARPA
   zones without manual intervention on the part of the ISP.


2.  Method

   1) CPE device generates a RSA key pair and stores this in non-
   volatile memory.

   2) CPE device generates a DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation [RFC3633] request
   which includes a KEY-RDATA option (code point TBA), which contains a
   the rdata of a DNS KEY record containing a RSASHA256 key using the
   public components of the previously generated RSA key pair.

   3) DHCP server updates DNS server based on the prefix it is
   delegating and the KEY-RDATA, using TSIG [RFC2845] for
   authentication, and responds with prefix.  If this is a new prefix
   delegation, it will clear out all the old DNS records as part of the
   delegation process.  If there are multiple prefixes being delegated
   the ISP's DNS server will be updated for all of them.  If the
   delegated prefix is not nibble aligned then the server will update
   all the reverse apex names that cover the address space, i.e. 1, 2, 4
   or 8 KEY records will be added all with the same rdata contents.

   4) CPE device configures the nameserver built into it to serve the
   reverse of the delegated prefixes.  Alternatively it may configure
   other nameservers to serve these zones, however the method to do that
   is out of scope for this document.

   5) CPE device generates a DNS UPDATE [RFC2136] which delegates the
   reverse name space to itself and others if they have been configured.
   It uses SIG(0) [RFC2931] to sign the request, with owner name
   matching the reverse of the delegated prefix.

   6) The ISP's DNS server is configured to accept self-signed requests
   (the owner name used in the SIG(0) signature matches the owner name
   of the data to be updated).  It examines the request, looks at the
   KEY record added by the DHCPv6 server, and decides whether the
   request is valid.

3.  Example

   If 2001:DB8:1:4::/62 is delegated then KEY records for

   4.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA KEY ...
   5.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA KEY ...
   6.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA KEY ...
   7.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA KEY ...

   will be added.  The CPE device will configure the nameservers to
   serve all of the following zones

   4.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA
   5.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA
   6.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA
   7.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA

   then will send individual UPDATE messages to delegate each of the
   reverse zones.

   % nsupdate -k K4.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA
   update add 4.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA NS ...
   send
   % nsupdate -k K5.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA
   update add 5.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA NS ...
   send
   % nsupdate -k K6.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA
   update add 6.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA NS ...
   send
   % nsupdate -k K7.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA
   update add 7.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA NS ...
   send


4.  IANA Considerations

   Allocate a DHCPv6 code point for KEY-RDATA.


5.  Security Considerations

   The UPDATE requests are all signed.  This is a proven method for
   securing UPDATE requests in the DNS.

   As a RSA key is being used there is no issue with key material being
   sent in the clear.

   Only the CPE device and the ISP itself is capable of creating,
