1. Introduction 
  Some discussion happened on request routing interface of CDNI among the CDNI 
  working group, consensus has been achieved that the request routing interface 
  comprises two main parts and these two parts should be addressed in different 
  documents to progress separately: 
    
  * the asynchronous advertisement of footprint and capabilities by a 
   dCDN that allows a uCDN to decide whether to redirect particular user requests to 
   that dCDN; and 
    
   * The synchronous operation of actually redirecting a user request.

Internet-Draft              cap-info-advertising                 February 2012 
   
  This document hence focuses on defining the Capability Information Advertising 
  Protocol for CDNI, which is one of the main building blocks of request routing 
  interface. 
      

1.1. Terminology 
  This document reuses the terminology defined in [I-D.draft-cdni-problem-statement]. 
 
1.2. Reference Model 
  Figure 1 from [I-D.draft-cdni-problem-statement] illustrating the 
  CDNI model and the CDNI interfaces are replicated below.  

  The Capability Information Advertising Protocol is not explicitly shown in figure 
  1. Although that might be changed later upon the working group's decision, but now 
  it is thought that capability advertisement is part of the function of the Request 
  Routing interface.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
  "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
  interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. Capability information description 

  The Capability Information Advertising Protocol allows the Downstream CDN to 
  provide the Upstream CDN with information (e.g. resources, footprint, load) to 
  facilitate selection of the Downstream CDN by the Upstream CDN request routing 
  system when processing subsequent content requests from User Agents. 

  From the perspective of an Upstream CDN, to make a routing decision from multiple 
  Downstream CDNs which will meet the local policy or requirement of the CP, the 
  information needed may includes: 

  O Status of each CDN, e.g. in service or out of service; 

  O Resource status of each Downstream CDN, e.g. usage percentage of acquisition 
  bandwidth, usage percentage of delivery bandwidth, available acquisition bandwidth, 
  available delivery bandwidth etc.; 

  O Footprint of each Downstream CDN;

Internet-Draft              cap-info-advertising                 February 2012 
   

  O Delivery protocol supported by each Downstream CDN; 

  O Cost information of each Downstream CDN; 

  O Authentication type to end user supported by each of the Downstream CDNs 
  (Optional) 

   

4. Protocol Function and Operation Overview 
  CDN capability is information coupling with a specified application (CDNI), it 
  should be conveyed via an application layer protocol rather than any other 
  underlying layer protocol e.g. IP layer which should de-coupling with any 
  application. In this document HTTP/1.1 protocol [RFC2616] is used for capability 
  information advertising. The CDNs which have contracted for providing 
  interconnection service to each other send capability advertisement messages to 
  their interconnected peers. The detailed capability information description and 
  message definition is described in section 5 of this document. 
   
  The Capability Information Advertising Protocol takes two modes. One is report 
  mode, where the Downstream CDN advertises its capability information to the 
  Upstream CDN during at a periodic interval, e.g. every 5 minutes. The other one is 
  query mode, where the Upstream CDN acquires the capability information from the 
  Downstream CDN periodically, e.g. every 5 minutes. The Upstream CDN utilizes the 
  capability information to makes its routing decision upon receiving a content 
  request from an end user. 
   
  To enable the communications over the Capability Information Advertising Protocol, 
  the two interconnected CDNs need to know each other's contact address. The contact 
  address may be statically pre-configured, dynamically discovered via control 
  interface, or other means. However, they are not specified in this document, as 
  this is considered not in the scope of the CDNI Capability Information Advertising 
  Protocol. 
   

5. Protocol Specification 

  This section describes the details of the Capability Information Advertising 
  Protocol. 

5.1. Capability information description 
  The Downstream CDN exposes its capability information to an Upstream CDN to 
  facilitate CDN selection among other functions. The exposure should be of 
  appropriate granularity to ensure the self-administrative nature of Downstream CDN. 
   
  The following information in Table 2 is considered for capability exchange.

  Note: The value of "maxDeliveryBW" and "DeliveryBWUsage" may be 
  an absolute value taking only the physical bandwidth of the CDN into 
  account or it may be a normalized value which may also consider the disk I/O 
  capacity and CPU usage as a whole. This depends on the CDN specific implementation 
  and is out of scope of CDNI.

  The HTTP request is HTTP POST for Report mode and HTTP GET for Query mode 
  respectively. 
   
  The request URI in both modes conforms to [RFC3986]. The URI format in this 
  document is as follows: HTTP://<host>/<url-path>, where the <host> specifies a 
  destination, and the <url-path>  conveys the message name. 
   
  The message body representation specified in this document is JavaScript Object 
  Notation(JSON). 

5.2.1. Report mode 
  The Downstream CDN issues an HTTP POST message to the Upstream CDN to report its 
  capability information. 
   
  The message name in the request URI is "CdniCapReport". 
   
  The Content-Type header field is "application/json". 
   
  The message body includes capability information. 
   
  Upon successful receipt of the POST request, the Upstream CDN responds with a 200 
  OK message. 
 
 
5.2.2. Query mode 
  The Upstream CDN issues a HTTP GET message to a Downstream CDN to query its 
  capability information. 
   
  The message name in the request URI is "CdniCapQuery". 
   
  Upon successful receipt of the GET request, the Downstream CDN responds a 200 OK 
  message with its capability information. 
   
  The Content-Type header field for the response is "application/json". 
   

5.3. Message examples 

  This section gives some message examples for Capability Information Advertising 
  Protocol. 

5.3.1. Report mode 
  The POST request and corresponding response are illustrated as below. 
   
  Request example (Downstream CDN to Upstream CDN): 
   
  POST http://contact-address.ucdn.example/CdniCapReport HTTP/1.1 
  Content-Type: application/json 
  Content-Length: 350

5.3.2. Query mode 
  The GET request and corresponding response are illustrated as below. 
   
  Request example (Upstream CDN to Downstream CDN): 
   
  GET http://contact-address.dcdn.example/CdniCapQuery HTTP/1.1 
   
   
  Response example: 
   
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
  Content-Type: application/json 
  Content-Length: 350 
   
  The content of message body is the same as that of POST message illustrated in 
  section 4.3.1. 
 
   

6. Security Considerations 
  Capability advertising is a main function which will affect the final routing 
  decision of an upstream CDN, security threats on it

  include that any identity spoofing of the downstream CDN or changing of the 
  capability advertising message with malicious intent which would cause the 
  upstream CDN redirect an end user request to an inappropriate downstream CDN which 
  possible cannot provide service to the end user.   
    
  It is mentioned in section 8 of the requirement draft [I-D.draft-cdni-
  requirements], all the CDNI interface shall support secure operation over 
  unsecured IP connectivity (e.g. The Internet).  This includes authentication, 
  confidentiality, integrity protection as well as protection against spoofing and 
  replay. As this security requirement applies to all the CDNI interfaces and it is 
  recommended that the working group addresses this issue and considers a consistent 
  solution in another separate document later. 
 
7. IANA Considerations 
  If the approach described in this document is adopted, we would request that IANA 
  allocate the message name "CdniCapReport" and CdniCapQuery" in the HTTP Parameters 
  registry.
