    <abstract>
      <t>The base ALTO specification defines two properties for cost metric
      attribute in the Cost MAP, including 'hopcount' and 'routingcost'. This
      specification define five new cost metric and one new parameter for
      Traffic Engineering(TE) performance information in the ALTO Information
      Resource Directory: Link Delay, Delay Variation, Packet Loss, Residual
      Bandwidth, Available Bandwidth,linkstate. They can be used either as
      constraint attribute associated with cost metric attribute 'routingcost'
      or returned cost metric in the response.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The ALTO protocol [I.D-ietf-alto-protocol] uses a REST-ful design ,
      and encodes its requests and responses using JSON. In ALTO architecture
      [I.D-ietf-alto-protocol], the ALTO server allows alto information to be
      gathered from multiple systems(e.g., routing protocol).
      [I.D-ietf-ospf-te-metric-extensions] describes extensions to OSPF TE
      called "OSPF TE Metric Extensions", that can be used to distribute
      network performance information (such as link delay, delay variation,
      packet loss, residual bandwidth, and available bandwidth). The mechanism
      defined in [I.D-ietf-ospf-te-metric-extensions]can be used by an ALTO
      Server to retrieve the necessary performance information supplementing
      the prefix and network topology data gathered from other sources in the
      underlying network.</t>

      <t>In the ALTO Information Resource Directory, Network and Cost Map are
      two core ALTO Information provided to clients. The TE performance metric
      can be represented using Cost MAP. The base ALTO specification
      [I.D-ietf- alto-protocol] defines one typical cost metric attribute for
      Cost Type in the Cost MAP (i.e.,'routingcost')and uses constraint
      attribute to list additional constraints to which elements of the Cost
      Map are related. This specification defines five new cost map attributes
      and one property associated with these attributes in alto information
      service: Link Delay, Link Jitter,Packet Loss, Residual Bandwidth,
      Available Bandwidth,linkstate. These five attribute and one new
      parameter can be either used as constraint attribute associated with
      'routingcost' cost metric attribute or used as returned Cost Map in the
      response.</t>

cost-type  The CostType (Section 9.7) for the returned costs.  The
cost-metric and cost-mode fields MUST match one of the supported
Cost Types indicated in this resource's capabilities
(Section 10.2.2.4).  The ALTO Client SHOULD omit the description
field, and if present, the ALTO Server MUST ignore the description
field.

constraints  Defines a list of additional constraints on which
elements of the Cost Map are returned.  This parameter MUST NOT be
specified if this resource's capabilities ( Section 10.2.2.4)
indicate that constraint support is not available.  A constraint
contains two entities separated by whitespace: (1) an operator,
 'gt' for greater than, 'lt' for less than, 'ge' for greater than
or equal to, 'le' for less than or equal to, or 'eq' for equal to;
(2) a target cost value.  The cost value is a number that MUST be
defined in the same units as the Cost Metric indicated by the
cost-metric parameter.  ALTO Servers SHOULD use at least IEEE 754
double-precision floating point [IEEE.754.2008] to store the cost
value, and SHOULD perform internal computations using double-
precision floating-point arithmetic.  If multiple 'constraint'
parameters are specified, they are interpreted as being related to
each other with a logical AND.

constraints  Defines a list of additional constraints on which

contains three entities separated by whitespace: (1)an cost type
is by default cost-type in the JSON Object of type ReqFilteredCostMap.
In addition, it could be another cost-type used for the returned cost 
(2) an operator, 'gt' for greater than, 'lt' for less than, 'ge' for
greater than or equal to, 'le' for less than or equal to, or 'eq' for 
equal to; (3) a target cost value.  The cost value is a number that 
MUST be defined in the same units as the Cost Metric indicated by the

Parameter name:  linkstate

Purpose:  Used in a multi-valued property to
          indicate whether it is steady state
          link performance.

Description:  When a property is multi-valued,
   LINKSTATE can be used to construct a steady state
   Performance topology for initial tunnel path computation,
   or to verify alternative failover paths. The LINSTATE
   is set when the measured value of this parameter exceeds
   its configured maximum threshold.  The LINKSTATE is
   cleared when the measured value falls below its
   configured threshold. LINKSTATE should be used
   together with Cost metric we defined in the
   section 3. Cost Metrics prefixed with 'lss:' are
   reserved for cost metric that is not steady state 
   link performance. Cost Metrics without prefix ‘lss:’ 
   indicate the cost metrics are steady state link performace.

            <t>In many standards track documents several words are used to
            signify the requirements in the specification. These words are
            often capitalized. This document defines these words as they
            should be interpreted in IETF documents. Authors who follow these
            guidelines should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of
            their document: <list>
                <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
                "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
                "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
                in RFC 2119.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Note that the force of these words is modified by the
