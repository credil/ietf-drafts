    Moving Generic Associated Channel registries to a new name space
             draft-andersson-mpls-moving-iana-registries-00

Abstract

   When RFC 6374 "Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks"
   were developed, the code points allocated by this RFC were mistakenly
   placed within the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameter registry.  This document creates
   a new dedicated name space for Generic Associated Channel code points
   and move them to a name space their own.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 6374 [RFC6374] specify protocols for delay and loss measurements.
   The protocols run over the Generic Associated Channel (GACh).  There
   are four registries with code points for these protocols.  These
   registries were mistakenly allocated within the LSP Ping Parameters
   namespace.  This document now creates a new GACh name space and move
   the Loss and Delay parameter registries to the new registry.

2.  Moving GACh parameters out of LSP Ping parameter registry

   In the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs) Ping Parameters" name space there are four registries that are
   for using the MPLS Generic Associated Channel [RFC5586]for MPLS Loss
   and Delay measurements [RFC6374].

   The registries are:

   o  Measurement Timestamp Type

   o  Loss/Delay Measurement Control Code: Query Codes

   o  Loss/Delay Measurement Control Code: Response Codes

   o  MPLS Loss/Delay Measurement TLV Object

Internet-Draft          Creating GACh registries               July 2013


   These registries are now moved into a new name space under the
   "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture" (MPLS) heading called
   "MPLS Generic Associated Channel Parameters".

   This is an update to RFC6374.

   The sub-section 9.2 in the IANA section of RFC6374 has a sentence
   that read:

   IANA has created a new "Measurement Timestamp Type" registry, with
   format and initial allocations as follows:

   This sentence is now changed to read:

   IANA has created a new "Measurement Timestamp Type" registry in the
   "MPLS Generic Associated Channel Parameters" name space, with format
   and initial allocations as follows:

   The sub-section 9.3 in the IANA section of RFC6374 has a sentence
   that read:

   IANA has created a new "MPLS Loss/Delay Measurement Control Code"
   registry.

   This sentence is now changed to read:

   IANA has created a new "MPLS Loss/Delay Measurement Control Code"
   registry in the "MPLS Generic Associated Channel Parameters" name
   space, with format and initial allocations as follows:

   The sub-section 9.4 in the IANA section of RFC6374 has a sentence
   that read:

   IANA has created a new "MPLS Loss/Delay Measurement TLV Object"
   registry, with format and initial allocations as follows:

   This sentence is now changed to read:

   IANA has created a new "MPLS Loss/Delay Measurement TLV Object"
   registry in the "MPLS Generic Associated Channel Parameters", with
   format and initial allocations as follows:

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to take the actions listed below.

3.1.  Moving Loss/Delay registries

   1.  To create a new name space called "MPLS Generic Associated
       Channel Parameters" under the "MPLS Architecture" heasding.

   2.  To move the "Measurement Timestamp Type", the "Loss/Delay
       Measurement Control Code: Query Codes", the "Loss/Delay
       Measurement Control Code: Response Codes" and the "MPLS Loss/
       Delay Measurement TLV Object" to the newly created "MPLS Generic
       Associated Channel Parameters" name space.

   3.  Not to change any of the values previously assigned in the
       registries that are moved.

   4.  The registries should be moved without any traces left in the
       "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths
       (LSPs) Ping Parameters" name space.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document is about updating the IANA LSP Ping TLV and sub-TLV
   registries and it does not add any new security issues as compared to
   the RFC that specifies the protocol.
