  Prefix Pool Option for DHCPv6 Relay Agents on Provider Edge Routers
                draft-yeh-dhc-dhcpv6-prefix-pool-opt-06

Abstract

   The DHCPv6 Prefix Pool option provides a mechanism for DHCPv6 Prefix
   Delegation (DHCPv6-PD), allowing the DHCPv6 server to notify a DHCPv6
   relay agent implemented on a Provider Edge (PE) router about active
   prefix pools allocated by the DHCPv6 server to the PE router.  The
   information of active prefix pools can be used to enforce IPv6 route
   aggregation on the PE router by adding or removing aggregated routes
   according to the status of the prefix pools.  The advertising of the
   aggregated routes in the routing protocol enabled on the network-
   facing interface of PE routers will dramatically decreases the number
   of the routing table entries in the network.

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Prefix Pool Option           January 2012


1.  Introduction

   The DHCPv6 protocol [RFC3315] specifies a mechanism for the
   assignment of IPv6 address and configuration information to IPv6
   nodes.  The DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) [RFC3633] specifies
   a mechanism for the delegation of IPv6 prefixes from the Delegating
   Router (DR) acting as the DHCPv6 server to the Requesting Routers
   (RR) acting as the DHCPv6 Clients.  DHCPv6 servers always maintain
   authoritative information related to their operations including, but
   not limited to, binding data of the delegated IPv6 prefixes, lease
   data of the delegated IPv6 prefixes, and binding data of their prefix
   pools.  A prefix pool configured and maintained on the server can
   usually be a short prefix (e.g., a /40 prefix) out of which the
   longer prefixes (e.g., /56 prefixes) are delegated to customer
   networks.

   In the scenario of a centralized DHCPv6 server, the Provider Edge
   (PE) routers act as DHCPv6 relay agents when the DHCPv6 server acting
   as DR and the DHCPv6 clients acting as RRs are not on the same link.
   For ensuring reachability, the PE routers always need to add or
   withdraw the route entries directing to each customer network in
   their routing table to reflect the status of IPv6 prefixes delegated
   by the DHCPv6 server to customer routers (a.k.a.  Routed-RG or
   Routed-CPE), which acts as RRs (see Section 6.2, [BBF TR-177]).

   When a routing protocol is enabled on the network-facing interface of
   the PE router, all the routes directing to the customer networks are
   advertised in the ISP network.  This will make the number of route
   entries in the routing table on the ISP router unacceptable large.
   Hence, it is desirable to aggregate the routes directing to the
   customer networks on the PE router.

   Because the prefixes of the customer networks can not be guaranteed
   to be valid and continuous, the routing protocol enabled on the PE
   router in general can not create one aggregated route automatically
   to cover all the prefixes delegated within the prefix pool.  One way
   to make the aggregated routes is to configure them manually and
   permanently per the provision of the prefix pools, but the PE router
   generally does not know about the prefix pools when it acts as the
   relay agent.

   This document proposes a new Prefix Pool option for the DHCPv6 relay
   agent implemented on PE routers, allowing the DHCPv6 server to notify
   the DHCPv6 relay agent about the prefix of pools.  After the PE
   router received information about the prefix pools, the aggregated
   route entries (e.g., black-hole routes) pointing to each of the
   prefix pools can be added or withdrawn in the routing table of the PE
   router.  The aggregated routes will be advertised into the ISP

   network through the routing protocol enabled on the PE's network-
   facing interface.

   DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery [RFC5460] specifies a mechanism for bulk
   transfer of the binding data of each delegated prefix from the server
   to the requestor (i.e., a DHCPv6 relay agent), to support the
   replacement or reboot event of a relay agent.  In this document, the
   capability of DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery will be extended to support the
   bulk transfer of the binding data of the prefix pools for route
   aggregation.


2.  Terminology and Language

   This document defines a new DHCPv6 option to communicate the prefix
   of an IPv6 prefix pool.  This document should be read in conjunction
   with the DHCPv6 specifications, [RFC3315], [RFC3633], [RFC5007] and
   [RFC5460], for understanding the complete mechanism.  Definitions for
   terms and acronyms not specified in this document are defined in
   [RFC3315], [RFC3633], [RFC3769], [RFC5007] and [RFC5460].

   The following terms can be found in this document:

   o  Requesting Router (RR): A router defined in [RFC3633] that acts as
      a DHCPv6 client, and is requesting prefix(es) to be assigned.

   o  Delegating Router (DR): A router defined in [RFC3633] that acts as
      a DHCPv6 server, and is responding to the prefix request.

   o  Prefix Pool: An IPv6 address space allocated with a common prefix
      out of which the longer prefixes are delegated via prefix
      delegation.

   o  Aggregated Route: A route entry created on an edge router, is
      based on the knowledge of a delegated prefix pool.

   o  Requestor: A router defined in [RFC5007] that acts as a DHCPv6
      relay agent, is leasequery client.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].


3.  Scenario and Network Architecture

   Figure 1 and Figure 2 illustrate two typical cases of the targeted
   network architectures.

   Reserved  2~255

   The status of 'Valid' in the Prefix Pool option can be used to add

   agent; while the status of 'Released' in the Prefix Pool option can
   be used to withdraw the prefix pool and the associated aggregated
   route on the relay agent.

   If the administrative policy on the DHCPv6 server permits and
   supports route aggregation on the relay agent, the status of prefix
   pool can be determined by the delegated prefixes within the
   associated prefix pool.  If there is one delegated prefix within the
   pool that has a valid lease, the status of the prefix pool will be
   'Valid'.  Otherwise, the status of the prefix pool is 'Released'.  If
   the administrative policy on the server does not permit or support
   route aggregation on the DHCPv6 relay agent, the status of the prefix
   pool will always be 'Released'.

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Prefix Pool Option           January 2012


5.  Relay Agent Behavior

   The relay agent who needs the information of prefix pools, must
   include the Option Request option (OPTION_ORO, 6) to request the
   Prefix Pool option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]) from the DHCPv6
   server, who maintains the status of the prefix pools associated to
   the relay agent itself (Figure 1) or its particular customer-facing
   interface (Figure 2) when receiving the DHCPv6-PD message from
   clients.  The DHCPv6 relay agent can include this Option Request
   option for the Prefix Pool option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]) in the
   relay-forward (12) message of SOLICIT (1), REQUEST (3), RENEW(5),
   REBIND (6) and RELEASE (8).  The relay agent may also include the
   Prefix Pool option with the field values of pfx-pool-len and IPv6-
   prefix to indicate its preference which prefix pool the relay agent
   would like the server to return.

   The relay agent should include the Interface ID option
   (OPTION_INTERFACE_ID, 18) so that the DHCPv6 server can identify the
   relay agent itself or its particular customer-facing interface to
   which the prefix pool is associated, if the server would not like to
   use the link-address field specified in the encapsulation of the
   DHCPv6 relay-forward message to identify the interface of the link on
   which the clients are located.

   After receiving the Prefix Pool option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD])
   for the relay agent itself or its particular customer-facing
   interface in the relay-reply message (13) of REPLY (7) from the
   DHCPv6 server, the relay agent shall add or withdraw the aggregated
   route entry per the status of the prefix pool.  If the status of the
   prefix pool received from the server is 'Valid', the relay agent
   shall add an aggregated route entry in its routing table, if the same
   entry has not been added in.  If the status of the prefix pool
   received from the server is 'Released', the relay agent shall
   withdraw the associated aggregated route entry in its routing table,
   if the same entry has not been withdrawn.  If there is no route entry
   directing to the customer network within the associated aggregated
   route, the relay agent shall automatically withdraw the aggregated
   route.

   The relay agent advertises its routing table including the entries of
   the aggregated routes based on the information of prefix pools when
   the routing protocol is enabled on its network-facing interface.

   The Relay Agent (i.e., Requestor) can use the DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery
   [RFC5460] to query the binding data of prefix pools in the 'Valid'
   status from the server.  After established a TCP connection with the
   DHCPv6 server, the relay agent must include Query option
   (OPTION_LQ_QUERY, 44) and set the proper query-type

   (QUERY_BY_RELAY_ID, QUERY_BY_LINK_ADDRESS, QUERY_BY_REMOTE_ID), link-
   address and query-options in the LEASEQUERY (14) message.  The query
   options must include Option Request option (OPTION_ORO, 6) to request
   the Prefix Pool option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]) from the server.


6.  Server Behavior

   Per DHCPv6-PD [RFC3633], if the prefix of the customer network
   requested in relay-forward message of SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW, REBIND
   by the DHCPv6 client (i.e., the RR) has a valid lease, the DHCPv6
   server (i.e., the DR) will delegate the prefix with the relevant
   parameters in the relay-reply message of REPLY.  In order to give a
   meaningful reply, the server has to be able to maintain the binding
   data of the delegated IPv6 prefixes with the identification of the
   client.  The Interface ID option (OPTION_INTERFACE_ID, 18) nested in
   the relay-forward message is usually used to identify the access line
   of the client.

   After receiving the Option Request option (OPTION_ORO, 6) requesting
   the Prefix Pool option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]) in the relay-
   forward messages of the PD, the server must include the Prefix Pool
   option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]) with the status indicated for the
   associated relay agent itself (Figure 1) or its customer-facing
   interface (Figure 2) in the relay-reply messages if the relay-forward
   messages received are valid.

   The server may use the link-address specified in relay-forward
   message to identify the relay agent itself or its particular
   customer-facing interface where the prefix pool is associated, but
   the server has to maintain the binding data of prefix pools in
   association with these link-addresses.  To be more readable, the
   server can alternatively use the Interface ID option
   (OPTION_INTERFACE_ID, 18) included in the relay-forward message by
   the relay agent to identify the relay agent itself (Figure 1) or its
   particular customer-facing interface (Figure 2) where the prefix pool
   is associated.  In order to give a meaningful reply, the server has
   to maintain the binding data of prefix pools in association with the
   information derived from the Interface ID option.

   Per DHCPv6 [RFC3315], the server shall copy the same Interface ID
   option received via the relay-forward message into the relay-reply
   message.

   If the server is configured to support route aggregation on the relay
   agent for the particular prefix pool, the status of this prefix pool
   can be determined by the delegated prefixes within the associated
   prefix pool.  If at least one of delegated prefix in the associated

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Prefix Pool Option           January 2012


   prefix pool has a valid lease, the server shall set the status of the
   prefix pool to be 'Valid'.  If the lease of each delegated prefix
   within the associated prefix pool has expired, or if the delegated
   prefix in the relay-forward message of RELEASE is the last prefix
   releasing in the associated prefix pool, the server shall set the
   status of the associated prefix pool to be 'Released'.  If the server
   is configured to not support route aggregation on the relay agent for
   the particular prefix pool, the status of prefix pool will always be
   'Released'.

   When the administrator of the server changes the setting to support
   route aggregation on the relay agent for the particular prefix pool,
   the server may send a relay-reply message of RECONFIGURE (10)
   including the Prefix Pool option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]) to add
   or withdraw the prefix pool and the associated aggregated route on
   the relay agent if at least one delegated prefix within the prefix
   pool has the valid lease.

   Multiple prefix pools may be associated with the same PE router
   implementing a DHCPv6 relay agent (Figure 1) or its customer-facing
   interface (Figure 2) in the binding table on the server.  Note that
   the delegated prefix is only from one prefix pool.

   After receiving the LEASEQUERY (14) message from the relay agent with
   the Query option (OPTION_LQ_QUERY, 44) including the Option Request
   option (OPTION_ORO, 6) to request the Prefix Pool option
   (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]), the server must include the Client Data
   options (OPTION_CLIENT_DATA, 45) in the LEASEQUERY-REPLY (15) and
   LEASEQUERY-DATA (16) message to convey the binding data of the
   associated prefix pools with the 'Valid' status through the
   established TCP connection per [RFC5460].  Each Client Data option
   (OPTION_CLIENT_DATA, 45) shall contain a Prefix Pool option
   (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]), and may contain the Interface ID option
   (OPTION_INTERFACE_ID, 18).  In order to be able to provide meaningful
   replies to different query types, the server has to be able to
   maintain the relevant association of prefix pools with the RELAY_ID,
   link addresses or Remote_ID of the relay agent in its binding
   database.


7.  Security Considerations

   Security issues related DHCPv6 are described in section 23 of
   [RFC3315].

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code to Option_Prefix_Pool from
   the "DHCPv6 and DHCPv6 options" registry
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-
   parameters.xml).
