              PIM flooding mechanism and source discovery
               draft-wijnands-pim-source-discovery-bsr-03

Abstract

   PIM Sparse-Mode uses a Rendezvous Point (RP) and shared trees to
   forward multicast packets to Last Hop Routers (LHR).  After the first
   packet is received by the LHR, the source of the multicast stream is
   learned and the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) can be joined.  This draft
   proposes a solution to support PIM Sparse Mode (SM) without the need
   for PIM registers, RPs or shared trees.  Multicast source information
   is flooded throughout the multicast domain using a new generic PIM
   flooding mechanism.  This mechanism is defined in this document, and
   is modeled after the PIM Bootstrap Router protocol.  By removing the
   need for RPs and shared trees, the PIM-SM procedures are simplified,
   improving router operations, management and making the protocol more
   robust.

2.  A generic PIM flooding mechanism

   The Bootstrap Router protocol (BSR) [RFC5059] is a commonly used
   protocol for distributing dynamic Group to RP mappings in PIM.  It is
   responsible for flooding information about such mappings throughout a
   PIM domain, so that all routers in the domain can have the same
   information.  BSR as defined, is only able to distribute Group to RP
   mappings.  We are defining a more generic mechanism that can flood
   any kind of information throughout a PIM domain.  It is not
   necessarily a domain though, it depends on administrative boundaries
   being configured.  The forwarding rules are identical to BSR, except
   that there is no BSR election.  The protocol includes an originator
   address which is used for RPF checking to restrict the flooding, just
   like BSR.  Just like BSR it is also sent hop by hop.  Note that there
   is no built in election mechanism as in BSR, so there can be multiple
   originators.  It is still possible to add such an election mechanism
   if this protocol is used in scenarios where this is desirable.  We
   include a type field, which can allow boundaries to be defined, and
   election to take place, independently per type.  We call this
   protocol the PIM Flooding Protocol (PFP).

   PIM Version:   Reserved, Checksum Described in [RFC4601].

   Type:   PIM Message Type.  Value (pending IANA) for a PFP message.

   [N]o-Forward bit:   When set, this bit means that the PFP message is
      not to be forwarded.

   Originator Address:   The address of the router that originated the
      message.  This can be any address assigned to this router, but
      MUST be routable in the domain to allow successful forwarding
      (just like BSR address).  The format for this address is given in
      the Encoded-Unicast address in [RFC4601].

   PFP Type:   There may be different sub protocols or different uses
      for this generic protocol.  The PFP Type specifies which sub
      protocol it is used for.

   [U]nknown-No-Forwarding bit:   Some sub protocols may require each
      router to do some processing of the contents and not simply
      forwarding.  This bit controls how a router should treat an
      unknown PFP Type.  When set, a router MUST NOT forward the message

      when the PFP Type is unknown.  When clear, a router MUST forward
      the message when possible.  If the PFP Type is known, then the
      specification of that type will specify how to handle the message,
      including whether it should be forwarded.

   Type 1..n:   A message contains one or more TLVs, in this case n
      TLVs.  The Type specifies what kind of information is in the
      Value.  Note that the Type space is shared between all PFP.  Not
      all types make sense for all protocol types though.

   Length 1..n:   The length of the the value field.




   Value 1..n:   The value associated with the type and of the specified
      length.

3.  Distributing Source to Group Mappings

   We want to provide information about active multicast sources
   throughout a PIM domain by making use of the generic flooding
   mechanism defined in the previous section.  We request PFP Type 0 to
   be assigned for this purpose.  We call a message with PFP Type 0 an
   SG Message.  We also define a PFP TLV which we request to be type 0.
   How this TLV is used with PFP Type 0 is defined in the next section.
   Other PFP Types may specify the use of this TLV for other purposes.
   For PFP Type 0 the U-bit MUST NOT be set.  This means that routers
   not supporting PFP Type 0 would still forward the message.

   Type:   This TLV has type 0.

   Length:   The length of the value.

   Group Address:   The group we are announcing sources for.  The format
      for this address is given in the Encoded-Group format in
      [RFC4601].

   Src Count:   How many unicast encoded sources address encodings
      follow.

   Src Holdtime:   The Holdtime (in seconds) for the corresponding
      source(s).

   Src Address:   The source address for the corresponding group.  The
      format for these addresses is given in the Encoded-Unicast address
      in [RFC4601].

4.  Originating SG messages

   An SG Mesage, that is a PFP message of Type 0, may contain one or
   more Group Source Holdtime TLVs.  This is used to flood information
   about active multicast sources.  Each FHR that is directly connected
   to an active multicast source originates SG BSR messages.  How a
   multicast router discovers the source of the multicast packet and
   when it considers itself the FHR follows the same procedures as the
   registering process described in [RFC4601].  After it is decided that
   a register needs to be sent, the SG is not registered via the PIM SM
   register procedures, but the SG mapping is included in an SG message.
   Note, only the SG mapping is distributed in the message, not the
   entire packet as would have been done with a PIM register.  The
   router originating the SG messages includes one of its own addresses
   in the originator field.  Note that this address must be routeable
   due to RPF checking.  The SG messages are periodically sent for as
   long as the multicast source is active, similar to how PIM registers
   are periodically sent.  The default announcement period is 60
   seconds, which means that as long as the source is active, it is
   included in an SG message originated every 60 seconds.  The holdtime
   for the source is by default 210 seconds.  Other values can be
   configured, but the holdtime must be larger than the announcement
   period.

5.  Processing SG messages




Wijnands, et al.        Expires January 13, 2014                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft PIM flooding mechanism and source discovery     July 2013


   A router that receives an SG message should parse the message and
   store the SG mappings with a holdtimer started with the advertised
   holdtime for that group.  If there are directly connected receivers
   for that group this router should send PIM (S,G) joins for all the SG
   mappings advertised in the message.  The SG mappings are kept alive
   for as long as the holdtimer for the source is running.  Once the
   holdtimer expires a PIM (S,G) prune must be sent to remove itself
   from the tree.

6.  The first packets and bursty sources

   The PIM register procedure is designed to deliver Multicast packets
   to the RP in the absence of a native SPT tree from the RP to the
   source.  The register packets received on the RP are decapsulated and
   forwarded down the shared tree to the LHRs.  As soon as an SPT tree
   is built, multicast packets would flow natively over the SPT to the
   RP or LHR and the register process would stop.  The PIM register
   process bridges the gap between how long it takes to build the SPT
   tree to the FHR.  If the packets would not be unicast encapsulated to
   the RP they would be dropped by the FHR until the SPT is setup.  This
   functionality is important for applications where the initial
   packet(s) must be received for the application to work correctly.
   Another reason would be for bursty sources.  If the application sends
   out a multicast packet every 4 minutes (or longer), the SPT is torn
   down (typically after 3:30 minutes of inactivity) before the next
   packet is forwarded down the tree.  This will cause no multicast
   packet to ever be forwarded.  A well behaved application should
   really be able to deal with packet loss since IP is a best effort
   based packet delivery system.  But in reality this is not always the
   case.

   With the procedures proposed in this draft the packet(s) received by
   the FHR will be dropped until the LHR has learned about the source
   and the SPT tree is built.  That means for bursty sources or
   applications sensitive for the delivery of the first packet this
   proposal would not be very applicable.  This proposal is mostly
   useful for applications that don't have strong dependency on the
   initial packet(s) and have a fairly constant data rate, like video
   distribution for example.  For applications with strong dependency on
   the initial packet(s) we recommend using PIM Bidir [RFC5015] or SSM
   [RFC4607].  The protocol operations are much simpler compared to PIM
   SM, it will cause less churn in the network and both guarantee best
   effort delivery for the initial packet(s).

   Another solution to address the problems described above is
   documented in [I-D.ietf-magma-msnip].  This proposal allows for a
   host to tell the FHR its willingness to act as Source for a certain
   Group before sending the data packets.  LHRs have time to join the



Wijnands, et al.        Expires January 13, 2014                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft PIM flooding mechanism and source discovery     July 2013


   SPT tree before the host starts sending which would avoid packet
   loss.  The SG mappings announced by [I-D.ietf-magma-msnip] can be
   advertised directly in SG messages, allowing a very nice integration
   of both proposals.  The life time of the SPT is not driven by the
   liveliness of Multicast data packets (which is the case with PIM SM),
   but by the announcements driven via [I-D.ietf-magma-msnip].  This
   will also prevent packet loss due to bursty sources.

7.  Resiliency to network partitioning

   In a PIM SM deployment where the network becomes partitioned, due to
   link or node failure, it is possible that the RP becomes unreachable
   to a certain part of the network.  New sources that become active in
   that partition will not be able to register to the RP and receivers
   within that partition are not able to receive the traffic.  Ideally
   you would want to have a candidate RP in each partition, but you
   never know in advance which routers will form a partitioned network.
   In order to be fully resilient, each router in the network may end up
   being a candidate RP.  This would increase the operational complexity
   of the network.

   The solution described in this document does not suffer from that
   problem.  If a network becomes partitioned and new sources become
   active, the receivers in that partitioned will receive the SG
   Mappings and join the source tree.  Each partition works
   independently of the other partition(s) and will continue to have
   access to sources within that partition.  As soon as the network
   heals, the SG Mappings are re-flooded into the other partition(s) and
   other receives can join to the newly learned sources.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations are no different from what is documented
   in [RFC5059].

9.  IANA considerations

   This document requires the assignment of a new PIM Protocol type for
   the PIM Flooding Protocol (PFP).  IANA also needs to create a
   registry for PFP Types with type 0 allocated to "Source-Group
   Message".  IANA also needs to create a registry for PFP TLVs, with
   type 0 allocated to the "Source Group Holdtime" TLV.  The allocation
   procedures are yet to be determined.
