This document lays out general definitions of and mechanisms for
establishing Uniform Resource Names (URN) "namespaces".  The URN WG
has defined a syntax for URNs in RFC 2141, as well as some proposed
mechanisms for their resolution and use in Internet applications in
RFC 3401 and RFC 3405.  The whole rests on the concept of individual
"namespaces" within the URN structure.  Apart from proof-of-concept
namespaces, the use of existing identifiers in URNs has been discussed
in RFC 2288.

This document is a product of the Uniform Resource Names Working Group
of the IETF.
