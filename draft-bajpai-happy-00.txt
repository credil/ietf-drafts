             Measuring the Effectiveness of Happy Eyeballs
                       draft-bajpai-happy-00.txt

Abstract

   The IETF has developed solutions that promote a healthy IPv4 and IPv6
   co-existence.  The happy eyeballs algorithm for instance, provides
   recommendations to application developers to help prevent bad user
   experience in situations where IPv6 connectivity is broken.  This
   document describes a metric used to measure the effectiveness of the
   happy eyeballs algorithm.  The insights uncovered by analysing the
   data from multiple locations is discussed.

1.  Introduction

   The function getaddrinfo(...) resolves a service name to a list of
   endpoints in an order that prioritizes an IPv6-upgrade path
   [RFC6724].  The order can dramatically reduce the application's
   responsiveness when IPv6 connectivity is broken.  The degraded user
   experience can be subverted by implementing the happy eyeballs
   algorithm [RFC6555].  The algorithm recommends that a host, after
   resolving the service name, tries a TCP connect(...) to the first
   endpoint.  However, instead of waiting for a timeout, it waits for
   300ms, after which it must initiate another TCP connect(...) to an
   endpoint with a different address family and start a competition to
   pick the one that completes first.

   This document describes a metric used to measure the effectiveness of
   the happy eyeballs algorithm.  The insights uncovered by analysing
   the data from multiple locations is discussed.

2.  Related Work

   Fred Baker in [RFC6556] describes metrics and testbed configurations
   to measure how quickly an application can reliably establish
   connections from a dual-stacked environment.  The metrics measure
   whether the communication establishment time is same regardless of
   the address family and the routing viability available to a dual-
   stacked host.  The metrics defined in [RFC6556] is different in three
   ways:

   o  DNS is accounted in connection establishment time.  Our metric
      does not take this into account.  Accounting DNS resolution may
      invite multiple input factors (slow resolvers) that may bias our
      TCP connection establishment time results.  In addition, according
      to [RFC6555], the 300ms advantage applies to the first address

      family after the getaddrinfo(...) call.  From a programming
      perspective, an application calls getaddrinfo(...) and that does
      its job, regardless of which address family is used.

   o  The testbed configuration in [RFC6556] is more passive than
      active.  An external analyser is used to passively observe the
      client's traffic using tcpdump.  There is no active measurement
      test, instead the routers along the path are configured to control
      what connectivity route is taken.  We on the other hand, have an
      active measurement test running on the client.  The test is
      agnostic to network path configuration since it independently
      tries a TCP connection to each connectivity route.  It also
      actively measures the time taken instead of relying on an external
      analyser program.

   o  The testbed setup in [RFC6556] is designed for a controlled
      environment.  The router in the path is configured to disrupt all
      but one routes to control the prefix used in the connection.  As
      such, the test is repeated N times with different router
      configurations to try all possible permutations of route
      connectivity.  Our measurement test is agnostic to the network
      path and does not require path configuration changes.

3.  Metric

   We have defined a metric that uses the TCP connection establishment
   times as a parameter to measure the algorithm's effectiveness.  The
   methodology also helps examine the impact of tunneling mechanisms
   employed by early adopters.  The input parameter of the metric is a
   (IP address, port number) tuple and the output is the connection
   establishment time, typically measured in microseconds.

4.  Implementation

   We have developed happy, a simple TCP happy eyeballs probing tool
   that conforms to the definition of our metric.  It uses non-blocking
   connect(...) calls to concurrently establish connections to all
   endpoints of a service and measures the elapsed time.  The tool
   enforces a small delay between concurrent connect(...) calls to avoid
   bursty TCP SYN traffic.  The initially performed service name
   resolution is not accounted in the connection establishment elapsed
   time.

5.  Measurement Trials

   We use Alexa's top 1M service names as input to prepare a top 100
   dual-stacked service names list.  We run happy on our internal test-
   bed of multiple measurement agents with different flavors of
   connectivity ranging from native IPv4, native IPv6, IPv6 tunnel
   broker endpoints, Teredo and tunnelled IPv4.  The list of Measurement
   Agents (MAs) is shown in Table 1.

   Figure 2 shows the standard deviation of the TCP connection

   (MA) is a SamKnows probe connected at Jacobs University Bremen.  It
   receives IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity via German Research Network (DFN)
   [AS 680].  A PDF rendering of the plot is available at [std].

   It appears that an application never uses IPv6 using Teredo except
   when IPv4 connectivity is broken.  We noticed, that a 300ms advantage
   leaves a dual-stacked host only 1% chance to prefer a IPv4 route even

   though it may be significantly faster than IPv6.  We also measured
   the margin by which happy eyeballs is inhibiting the fastest
   available route by comparing the slowness of a happy eyeballed winner
   to that of the loser.

7.  Conclusions

   We have performed a preliminary study on measuring the effectiveness
   of happy eyeballs.  We noticed several cases where the algorithm does
   not select the best route and instead hampers the user experience.
   We are working towards running this test on a large-scale measurement
   platform to develop a more comprehensive picture to help improve the
   algorithm.
