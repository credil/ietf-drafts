Abstract

   The purpose of this document is to register the 'xri' Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme, which is used in URIs mapped from
   Extensible Resource Identifiers (XRIs), in the corresponding IANA
   registry under 'provisional' category.

1. Introduction

   Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards
   (OASIS) has developed the specification of Extensible Resource
   Identifiers (XRIs).  An XRI is a protocol element which is a superset
   of Internalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [RFC3987] and is designed
   to suit Requirements for Uniform Resource Names (URNs), laid out in
   RFC 1737 [RFC1737], even though they are not URNs [RFC2141]
   themselves.

   Current version of XRI syntax specification [XRISyntax], Section
   2.3.1, specifies how to map XRIs to IRI [RFC3987] and URI [RFC3986]
   references.  It prescribes that the scheme name to be used in such
   IRIs and URIs is "xri".  The purpose of this document is to formally
   register the scheme with IANA in the corresponding registry under
   'provisional' category.

   Please note that there is no assurance that further versions of XRI
   specifications (including the work-in-progress "XRI Syntax 3.0"
   [XRISyntax3]) will continue to use 'xri' URIs; if its use gets
   deprecated, the scheme will be moved to 'historical' to reflect this.

1.1. Community Consensus

   OASIS has the Technical Committee (TC), which is responsible for
   developing and maintaining XRI specifications, - XRI TC.  This
   document has been prepared for this TC and has received its review,
   which revealed wide consensus of the TC's members.

2. Registration Template for 'xri' URI Scheme

   This section contains the registration template for 'xri' URI scheme,
   as required by [RFC4395].

     URI scheme name: xri

     Status: Provisional

     URI scheme syntax: see Section 2.3.1 of [XRISyntax]

     URI scheme semantics: XRIs and correspondingly 'xri' URIs are meant
     to persistently identify the resource, as URNs [RFC2141]; see

     'xri' URIs

3. Security Considerations

   Security considerations for XRIs are discussed in Section 3 of
   [XRISyntax].

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the 'xri' URI scheme using the template of
   Section 2.
