Abstract

   A DECADE system must provide discovery mechanisms which enable the
   automatic configuration of DECADE clients with all information
   necessary to contact appropriate DECADE servers in the network. 
   Typically, this configuration information would include the domain
   name or IP address of each DECADE server that should be considered by
   the client.  Ideally, a DECADE discovery mechanism should capitalize
   upon existing Internet protocols, such as DHCP, which is widely
   deployed today.  This document discusses DECADE server discovery and,
   as a first step towards automatic discovery, specifies how a DECADE
   client can obtain server location information using DHCP.  To this
   end, it defines two DHCPv6 options which can be used to automatically
   provision the domain name or IP address of suitable servers in a
   DECADE system.

INTERNET DRAFT          DECADE Server Discovery       September 13, 2012


2  Introduction

   The Decoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) architecture [D-ARCH]
   defines a system comprising content distribution applications, in-
   network storage, and network servers that can improve the efficiency
   of sharing data in the Internet as a whole, as well as in smaller,
   confined IP networks.

   DECADE aims at being an open system [RFC6646] in which applications
   can store and retrieve data objects inside the network and use DECADE
   servers to manage them [D-REQS].  Applications are also given the
   means to explicitly control who can access their stored data objects
   via the DECADE servers [D-ARCH].  

   A single DECADE system may include numerous servers deployed at
   different parts of the network, some of which may handle the general
   storage needs of the entire user base while others could provide
   purpose-specific quotas to a subset of the users.  In such a large
   system, each client should be able to locate all servers which it is
   authorized to use.  In particular for large organizations, automatic
   provisioning and configuration of DECADE clients, possibly taking
   into consideration the point of network attachment, is important from
   an operations and management perspective.

   Obviously, application end-points can use "native application
   protocols" to exchange information about DECADE server locations and
   convey such information to their respective DECADE client.  For
   example, once an application end-point uploads a data object in a
   server, it can notify its peer about the server location where the
   data object has been stored along with all necessary credentials to
   access it.  Such application-level only interaction may be plausible
   for many scenarios.  However, in other scenarios, the network
   administrator may wish to point applications wishing to partake in a
   DECADE system to suitable servers based on network-related
   preferences.

   Overall, the mechanism(s) defined in this document can assist DECADE
   clients in determining which server(s) to use.  In general, we should
   expect that DECADE server location information could be provisioned
   through different channels.  This document introduces DECADE server
   discovery and, as a first step towards this direction, specifies how
   a DECADE client can obtain server location information using DHCP. 
   In doing so, this specification follows the recommendation of
   [D-ARCH] and reuses and extends an existing and widely deployed, we
   may add, protocol for server discovery in a DECADE system.  Finally,
   by capitalizing on DHCP [RFC3315], this client configuration method
   can support both push and pull functionality on behalf of the network
   administrator.

INTERNET DRAFT          DECADE Server Discovery       September 13, 2012


   The rest of this document is organized as follows.  After clarifying
   the terminology used in this document in the following subsection, we
   proceed with the introduction of DECADE server discovery in Sections
   3 and 4.  DECADE client operation in this context is discussed in
   Section 5.  Finally, Section 6 presents the specification's security
   considerations.

2.1  Terminology

   This document uses the terms DECADE-compatible client, server,
   system, and data object as defined in [D-REQS].  In general, we will
   use the terms "client" and "server" to refer to the DECADE system
   entities.  In addition, within the context of this document, we
   assume a DECADE-compatible system with an architecture as described
   in [D-ARCH].

   Further, this document uses the terms DHCP client, server, DUID, and
   domain as defined in RFC 3315 [RFC3315].

   Finally, and unless otherwise noted, the terms "IP" and "DHCP" refer
   to IPv6 and DHCPv6, respectively. 


3  DECADE Server Discovery

   According to [D-REQS][D-ARCH], a DECADE compatible system MUST
   include a server discovery mechanism.  Clearly, DECADE clients MAY
   obtain server configuration details by other means, including manual
   configuration, presets at the operating system or application level,
   or using other application-specific protocols.  For instance, a
   DECADE-compatible application may come pre-configured to access a
   particular server through its fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or
   globally routable IP address.

   In addition, however, the network administrator may wish to provision
   DECADE system related information to eligible nodes authorized to
   connect at different attachment points of the network.  For example,
   each domain in a large organization may include a (set of) DECADE
   server(s) accessible for use only by the nodes in the particular
   domain, such as the data analysis or the software development
   department.  Deployment of servers on the basis of geographical or
   departmental criteria can often take advantage of traffic locality to
   improve performance and security as well as ease management and
   maintenance tasks.

   Moreover, the network administrator may choose to provision all
   eligible network nodes with information about further DECADE
   server(s), which may be accessible from the entire network of the

   organization.  The client could also be provisioned with backup
   DECADE server location information to improve system resilience or to
   balance traffic load.  In all, a DECADE client can take advantage of
   any manually (or otherwise) provisioned servers, may use different
   servers when connected to different network attachment points, and
   should be able to access organization-wide DECADE servers in
   parallel.

   Examples for automatic configuration of DECADE clients based on the
   preferences of the network administrator abound.  Consider, for
   instance, the case of users traveling abroad.  Subscribers of an ISP
   providing residential broadband connectivity may use the ISP's DECADE
   server when connected from home but can take advantage of another
   server when on vacation at a resort hotel halfway around the globe. 
   This nowadays typical scenario, involves users uploading and sharing
   with friends vacation photos and videos while connected to a Wi-Fi
   hotspot.

   In this case, the administrator of the Wi-Fi hotspot may offer DECADE
   services along with plain Internet connectivity to all nodes
   connected to its network.  In principle, the administrator could
   require users to manually enter (local) server location information. 
   In practice, however, this process is cumbersome and error-prone.  It
   would be far better if the DECADE client on each node connected to
   the Wi-Fi hotspot were able to automatically discover available
   server location information in this network.  This way, the
   vacationers of our example could exchange photos and videos as data
   objects stored locally at the DECADE server of the resort with their
   friends vacationing at the same hotel while, at the same time, they
   could arrange that all of their data objects were also stored at
   another DECADE server back home.

   The following section specifies the mechanisms which enable a DECADE
   client to obtain the DECADE server domain name(s) and/or IP
   address(es) based on the network administrator preferences using
   DHCP, thus providing a solution for scenarios such as those described
   above.

   Note that the use of DHCP for discovering DECADE servers is
   orthogonal to other mechanisms for DECADE client configuration.  A
   DECADE client, in coordination with the application(s) using the
   DECADE system, can decide which server(s) to employ based on several
   factors, such as, for example, user preferences; node and network
   policies; authorization, trust, privacy, and other security concerns;
   quota availability and usage cost; and end-to-end performance, just
   to name a few.  However, the decision making process regarding which
   of the available (or already discovered) servers to use is outside
   the scope of the server discovery specification.

4  DECADE Server Discovery using DHCP

   A DECADE client MAY use DHCP to obtain server location information
   (e.g., domain name or IP address) in the network.  This specification
   defines two DHCP options: one for obtaining an ordered list of DECADE
   server domain names and another for obtaining an ordered list of
   DECADE server IP addresses, described in subsections 4.1 and 4.2,
   respectively.  The DHCP options defined herein refer to server
   location information only.

   A DECADE-compatible application MAY trigger the DHCP-based server
   discovery process upon its startup or at any point of time during its
   operation.  The DHCP client on the node MUST provide a mechanism for
   the DECADE client to retrieve the DECADE server location information
   as received from the network.

   A DECADE-compatible application and/or DECADE client MAY indicate to
   the DHCP client on the node the currently configured DECADE
   server(s).  Said server(s) SHOULD have been used successfully in a
   previous application session, regardless of how they have been
   configured, i.e. via DHCP or otherwise, perhaps even manually, at an
   earlier stage.

   In addition, on a node with support for DECADE protocols, it is
   possible to discover DECADE server(s) upon bootstrapping or operating
   system configuration time, as well as when the node changes its point
   of network attachment, or when new interfaces become active.  That
   is, the DHCP client on a node with DECADE support MAY use the DHCP
   options described in this document whenever it obtains a new address
   for any of its interfaces.  In this case, when a DECADE-compatible
   application is started, it MAY use the DECADE server(s) which were
   already discovered through DHCP without initiating another discovery
   process.

   Finally, a DHCP implementation MUST support both options as described
   in subsections 4.1 and 4.2, below, in order to be compliant with this
   specification.

4.3  DHCP Client Operation

   A DHCP client implementing these options and running on a node with a
   DECADE-compatible client MAY send neither, either, or both of the
   DHCP options defined in this document.

   A DHCP client implementing this option can include the DECADE Server
   DHCP options in its Option Request Option (ORO) as per [RFC3315] at
   node bootstrap, (re)configuration time, or upon explicit request from
   a DECADE client.  See also Section 4.5, below.

   The DHCP client MUST make all DECADE server configuration
   information, as received from the DHCP server, available to the
   DECADE client(s) on the node.  For example, if both a domain name
   list and a IP address list are returned by the DHCP server, then the
   DECADE client must be able to obtain both lists as ordered by the
   network administrator. 

4.4  DHCP Server Operation

   A DHCP server that implements the options specified in this document
   and is configured by the network administrator with DECADE server
   location information (domain name and IP address):

   * MAY send both the domain name list and the IP address list,
     even if the DHCP client did not explicitly request DECADE server
     location information in its ORO.

   * SHOULD send the domain name list and it MAY send the IP address
     list, if the client requests the DECADE Server Domain Name List.

   * MUST send the IP address list and it MAY send the domain name list,
     if the client requests the DECADE Server IP Address List only.

   The DHCP server MAY use the DHCP Unique IDentifier (DUID) [RFC3315]
   of the DHCP client to determine the contents of the DECADE server
   list(s) to be returned. 

4.5  Option Appearance 

   The DECADE Server Domain Name List and DECADE Server IP Address List
   options MUST each appear at most once in any DHCP message.  The order
   in which these options appear is not significant; however, the DHCP
   client MUST maintain the order of servers in the respective lists as
   set by the DHCP server.

   The DECADE Server Domain Name List and DECADE Server IP Address List
   options MUST appear only in the following DHCP messages [RFC3315]: 
   Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind, Information-Request, and
   Reply.  If either of these options appears in other DHCP messages,
   they MUST be ignored by compliant implementations.

   Similarly, the option numbers for the options defined in this
   specification (OPTION_DECADE_SERVER and OPTION_DECADE_SERVER_ADDR)
   MAY appear in the Option Request Option (ORO) part of the following
   DHCP messages [RFC3315]:  Solicit, Request, Renew, Rebind,
   Information-Request, and Reconfigure.  If either of these option
   numbers appears in other DHCP messages, they SHOULD be ignored by
   compliant implementations.

4.6  On DHCP Options Aliasing 

   The network location of a DECADE server can be defined through an IP
   address or a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).  In principle, the
   network administrator need only configure the DECADE server domain
   names in a DHCP server.  The DHCP server implementation can perform
   the domain name lookup on behalf of the DHCP client and return the
   DECADE server IP address list instead of the domain name list, thus
   reducing signaling overhead in terms of DNS resolution messages and
   packet overhead as argued in [GUIDE], Section 7.  Therefore, one can
   make the case that there is no need to define two options that
   provision the same type of configuration parameter, in this case, the

INTERNET DRAFT          DECADE Server Discovery       September 13, 2012


   DECADE server location information.  Hence, defining one option, e.g.
   the DECADE Server IP Address List, instead of two, should be
   sufficient.

   However, it is more likely than not that a DECADE client can take
   better decisions about which DECADE server(s) to use if it does
   obtain the domain name of the server(s).  To sum up, and given the
   advantages of DNS indirection as well, a DECADE client SHOULD prefer
   DECADE servers which can be located by an FQDN.  That said, and given
   the strong recommendation against aliasing [GUIDE], it remains for
   the DECADE WG to decide which of the two options to choose, if a
   choice is mandated.


5  DECADE Client Operation

   In general, the DECADE client SHOULD prefer to contact a DECADE
   server using its domain name.  The indirection and late binding
   provided by DNS should be taken advantage of whenever possible. 
   However, it is possible that for certain DECADE system deployments
   DNS cannot be used or be relied upon, hence, a DECADE client MAY
   contact a server using an IP address. 

   The client implementation may maintain two separate lists for DECADE
   domain names and IP addresses.  The list(s) of DECADE servers at the
   client may be prioritized according to various factors and can
   include server location information which has been entered manually
   or configured automatically, e.g., via DHCP. 

   With respect to the list of DECADE server location information made
   available to the DECADE client via the DHCP options defined in this
   document (or other means), the DECADE client MAY decide to ignore all
   DECADE servers suggested by the network administrator.  However, if
   the DECADE client decides to use the servers suggested by the network
   administrator via DHCP, the client MUST consider all domain names in
   the received list first, before initiating connections to DECADE
   servers in the IP address list.


6  Security Considerations

   In general, a DECADE client SHOULD be on guard with all configuration
   information which is dynamically provisioned.  In particular, the
   DECADE client should exercise caution when using dynamically
   provisioned information as it may end up contacting malicious DECADE
   servers, the operators of which could get access to sensitive or
   private information, lead denial of service attacks, pollute data
   objects uploaded on the server, and so on.  That said, DHCP supports

   an authentication mechanism that can alleviate man-in-the-middle
   attacks and more authentication mechanisms may be deployed; see
   [GUIDE].

   DHCP is used to provision nodes with generally applicable
   configuration information.  As such, the server location information
   received by a client SHOULD apply to all applications running on the
   node.  A DECADE system administrator SHOULD NOT use the DHCP options
   defined in this document to provide application-specific server
   locations in order to avoid placing extraneous load on the DHCP
   server infrastructure.

   As the server location can be used by any application in a DECADE-
   compatible node, effectively, DHCP can be used to provide further
   server options to DECADE-compatible applications.  However, the
   availability of server location information does not necessarily mean
   that the client has access to store and retrieve data objects from
   the servers obtained through DHCP.  Authentication and authorization
   for accessing each server included in the lists obtained via DHCP are
   performed as per usual.

   The security considerations in [D-ARCH], [D-REQS], and [RFC3315]
   apply here as well, and DECADE client and server implementers ought
   to keep in mind that a range of attacks from within the network are
   possible.


7  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign two option codes from the "DHCPv6 Options
   Codes" registry for OPTION_DECADE_SERVER and
   OPTION_DECADE_SERVER_ADDR.


8  Acknowledgments

   Section 4 of this draft would not be possible without the great job
   done by the folks who wrote [RFC3315], [RFC3319], [RFC5908], and
   [GUIDE].  Tomasz Mrugalski provided valuable pointers and insights
   with respect to DHCP, in general, and options definitions, in
   particular.  Many thanks!
