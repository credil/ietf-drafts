Abstract 

   This document defines a schema, object classes and attributes, for
   Printers and Print Services, for use with directories that support
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (RFC 4510).  This document is
   based on the Printer attributes listed in Appendix E of Internet
   Printing Protocol/1.1 (IPP) (RFC 2911).  Additional Printer
   attributes are based on definitions in the Printer MIB v2 (RFC 3805),
   IEEE-ISTO PWG Command Set for IEEE 1284 Device ID (PWG 5107.2),
   IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 (PWG 5100.13),
   and IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP Everywhere (PWG 5100.14).  
   
   This document is published by the IETF on behalf of the Internet
   Printing Protocol Working Group of the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working
   Group.  
   
   This document updates RFC 3712.

Internet-Draft       LDAP Schema for Printer Services        17 May 2013



1.  Introduction

   This document defines several object classes to provide Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol [RFC4510] applications with flexible
   options in defining Printer information using LDAP schema.  Classes
   are provided for defining directory entries with common Printer
   information as well as for extending existing directory entries with
   SLPv2 [RFC2608], IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], and LPR [RFC1179]
   protocol-specific information.  
   
   This document is published by the IETF on behalf of the Internet
   Printing Protocol Working Group [PWGIPP] of the IEEE-ISTO Printer
   Working Group [PWG].  
   
   This document updates RFC 3712.  
   
   The schema defined in this document is based on the Printer
   attributes listed in Appendix E 'Generic Directory Schema' of
   Internet Printing Protocol/1.1 (IPP) [RFC2911].  Additional Printer
   attributes are based on definitions in the Printer MIB v2 [RFC3805],
   IEEE-ISTO PWG Command Set for IEEE 1284 Device ID [PWG5107.2],
   IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 [PWG5100.13], or
   IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP Everywhere [PWG5100.14] 
   
   The schema defined in this document is technically aligned with the
   stable IANA-registered 'service:printer:' v2.0 template [SLPPRT20],
   for compatibility with already deployed Service Location Protocol
   (SLPv2) [RFC2608] service advertising and discovery infrastructure.
   The attribute syntaxes are technically aligned with the
   'service:printer:' v2.0 template - therefore simpler types are
   sometimes used (for example, 'DirectoryString' [RFC4517] rather than
   'labeledURI' [RFC2079] for the 'printer-uri' attribute).  
   
   Please send comments directly to the authors at the addresses listed
   in the section "Authors' Addresses".  
   
   
   
   1.1.  Rationale for using DirectoryString Syntax
   
   The attribute syntax 'DirectoryString' (UTF-8 [STD63]) defined in
   [RFC4517] is specified for several groups of string attributes that
   are defined in this document:  
   
   1)  URI 
       - printer-uri, printer-xri-supported, printer-more-info,
       printer-charge-info-uri, printer-uuid 
       
       The UTF-8 encoding is compatible with deployment of (UTF-8 based)

Internet-Draft       LDAP Schema for Printer Services        17 May 2013

       IRI Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [RFC3987].  
       
   2)  Description 
       - printer-name, printer-location, printer-info,
       printer-make-and-model 
       
       The UTF-8 encoding supports descriptions in any language,
       conformant with the IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages
       [BCP18].  
       
       Note:  The printer-natural-language-configured attribute contains
       a language tag [BCP47] for these description attributes (for
       example, to support text-to-speech conversions).  
       
   3)  Keyword 
       - printer-compression-supported, printer-finishings-supported,
       printer-media-supported, printer-media-local-supported,
       printer-print-quality-supported 
       
       The UTF-8 encoding is compatible with the current IPP/1.1
       [RFC2911] definition of the equivalent attributes, most of which
       have the IPP/1.1 union syntax 'keyword or name'.  The keyword
       attributes defined in this document are extensible by
       site-specific or vendor-specific 'names' which behave like new
       'keywords' 
       
       Note:  In IPP/1.1, each value is strongly typed over-the-wire as 
       either 'keyword' or 'name'.  This union selector is not preserved
       in the definitions of these equivalent LDAP attributes.  
   
   
   
   1.2.  Rationale for using caseIgnoreMatch
   
   The EQUALITY matching rule 'caseIgnoreMatch' defined in [RFC4517] is 
   specified for several groups of string attributes that are defined in
   this document:  
   
   1)  URI 
       
       These URI attributes specify EQUALITY matching with
       'caseIgnoreMatch' (rather than with 'caseExactMatch') in order to
       conform to the spirit of [STD66], which requires case insensitive
       matching on the host part of a URI versus case sensitive matching
       on the remainder of a URI.  
       
       These URI attributes follow existing practice of supporting case 
       insensitive equality matching for host names in the
       associatedDomain attribute defined in [RFC4524].  
       
       Either equality matching rule choice would be a compromise:

Internet-Draft       LDAP Schema for Printer Services        17 May 2013

       a) case sensitive whole URI matching can lead to false negative
       matches and has been shown to be fragile (given deployed client
       applications that 'pretty up' host names displayed and
       transferred in URI); 
       b) case insensitive whole URI matching can lead to false positive
       matches, although it is a dangerous practice to publish URI that
       differ only by case (for example, in the path elements).  
       
   2)  Description 
       
       Case insensitive equality matching is more user-friendly for
       description attributes.  
       
   3)  Keyword 
       
       Case insensitive equality matching is more user-friendly for
       keyword attributes.  
       
   4)  IEEE 1284 Device ID 
       
       Case insensitive equality matching is mandatory for IEEE 1284
       Device ID attributes.  
   
   
   
   1.3.  Rationale for using caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
   
   The SUBSTR matching rule 'caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch' defined in
   [RFC4517] is specified for several groups of string attributes that
   are defined in this document:  
   
   1)  URI 
       
       These URI attributes follow existing practice of supporting case 
       insensitive equality matching for host names in the
       associatedDomain attribute defined in [RFC4524].  
       
   2)  Description 
       
       Support for case insensitive substring matching is more
       user-friendly for description attributes.  
       
   3)  Keyword 
       
       Support for case insensitive substring matching is more
       user-friendly for keyword attributes.  
       
   4)  IEEE 1284 Device ID 
       
       Support for case insensitive substring matching is mandatory for
       IEEE 1284 Device ID attributes.

3.  Definition of Object Classes

   We define the following LDAP object classes for use with both generic
   Printer related information and services specific to SLPv2 [RFC2608],
   IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], and LPR [RFC1179].  
   
   slpServicePrinter - auxiliary class for SLP registered Printers
   printerAbstract - abstract class for all Printer classes
   printerService - structural class for Printers
   printerServiceAuxClass - auxiliary class for Printers
   printerIPP - auxiliary class for IPP Printers
   printerLPR - auxiliary class for LPR Printers
   
   The following are some examples of how applications could choose to
   use these classes when creating directory entries:  
   
   1)  Use printerService for directory entries containing common
       Printer information.  
       
   2)  Use both printerService and slpServicePrinter for directory
       entries containing common Printer information for SLP registered
       Printers.  
       
   3)  Use printerService, printerLPR and printerIPP for directory
       entries containing common Printer information for Printers that
       support both LPR and IPP.  
       
   4)  Use printerServiceAuxClass and object classes not defined by this
       document for directory entries containing common Printer
       information.  In this example, printerServiceAuxClass is used for
       extending other structural classes defining Printer information
       with common printer information defined in this document.  
   
   Refer to Section 4 for definition of attribute types referenced by
   these object classes.  We use attribute names instead of OIDs in
   object class definitions for clarity.  Some attribute names described
   in [RFC2911] have been prefixed with 'printer-' as recommended in
   [RFC2926] and [SLPPRT20].

   This auxiliary class defines Service Location Protocol (SLPv2)
   [RFC2608] specific information.  It SHOULD be used with a structural
   class such as printerService.  It MAY be used to create new or extend
   existing directory entries with SLP 'service:printer' abstract
   service type information as defined in [SLPPRT20].  This object class
   is derived from 'slpService', the parent class for all SLP services,
   defined in [RFC2926].

4.  Definition of Attribute Types

   The following attribute types are referenced by the object classes
   defined in Section 3.  
   
   The following attribute types reference syntax OIDs defined in
   Section 3 of [RFC4517] (see Section 5 'Definition of Syntaxes'
   below).  
   
   The following attribute types reference matching rule names (instead
   of OIDs) for clarity (see Section 6 below).  For optional attributes,
   if the Printer information is not known, the attribute value SHOULD
   not be set.  In the following definitions, referenced matching rules
   are defined in Section 4 of [RFC4517] (see Section 6 'Definition of
   Matching Rules' below).  
   
   Note:  For interoperability and consistent text display, values of
   attributes defined in this document:  (a) SHOULD be normalized as
   recommended in Unicode Format for Network Interchange [RFC5198]; (b) 
   SHOULD not contain DEL or any C0 or C1 control characters except for
   HT, CR, and LF; (c) SHOULD only contain CR and LF characters together
   (not as singletons); and SHOULD NOT contain HT, CR, or LF characters
   in names, e.g., printer-name and printer-aliases.  
   
   Note:  Some of the following attributes are described as 'List of
   xxx' (using a comma as the member delimiter).  Some other attributes
   are described as 'One of xxx' (single-valued).  In all cases, any
   attribute can have multiple values represented as multiple instances.
   
   The following table is a summary of the attribute names defined by
   this document and their corresponding source document names as
   defined in [RFC2911], [RFC3805], [PWG5107.2], or [PWG5100.13].  Some
   source attribute names have been prefixed with 'printer-' as
   recommended in [RFC2926], to address the flat namespace for LDAP
   identifiers.

   fields.  
   
   Note:  Multiple values for this attribute are represented as multiple
   instances of this attribute.  
   
   Values of URI SHOULD conform to [STD66], although URI schemes can be 
   defined which do not conform to [STD66] (see [BCP35]).  
   
   Note:  LDAP application clients SHOULD not attempt to use malformed

   'uri-authentication-supported', and 'uri-security-supported' (called 
   the 'Three Musketeers' because they are parallel ordered attributes) 
   defined in IPP/1.1 [RFC2911].  This attribute unfolds those IPP/1.1
   attributes and thus avoids the ordering (and same number of values)
   constraints of the IPP/1.1 separate attributes.  
   
   Defined keywords for fields include:  
   
       'uri' (IPP 'printer-uri-supported')
       'auth' (IPP 'uri-authentication-supported')
       'sec' (IPP 'uri-security-supported')
   
   A missing 'auth' field SHOULD be interpreted to mean 'none'.  Per
   IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3
   [PWG5100.13], and IANA IPP Registry [IANAIPP], defined values of the
   'auth' field include:  
   
       'none' (no authentication for this URI)
       'requesting-user-name' (from operation request)
       'basic' (HTTP/1.1 Basic [RFC2617])
       'digest' (HTTP/1.1 Digest [RFC2617])
       'certificate' (X.509 Certificate [RFC5280])
       'negotiate' (HTTP/1.1 Negotiate [RFC4559])
   
   A missing 'sec' field SHOULD be interpreted to mean 'none'.  Per
   IPP/1.1 [RFC2911] and IANA IPP Registry [IANAIPP], defined values of
   the 'sec' field include:  
   
       'none' (no security for this URI)
       'ssl3' (Netscape SSL3)
       'tls' (IETF TLS, [RFC5246])
   
   Each XRI field MUST be delimited by '<', with optional trailing
   whitespace.  For example:  
   
       'uri=ipp://example.com/ipp< auth=digest< sec=tls<'
       'uri=ipps://example.com/ipp< auth=digest< sec=tls<'

8.  Internationalization Considerations

   All text string attributes defined in this document of syntax
   'DirectoryString' [RFC4517] have values that are encoded in UTF-8
   [STD63], as required by [RFC4517].  
   
   A language tag [BCP47] for all of the text string attributes defined
   in this document is contained in the
   printer-natural-language-configured attribute.  
   
   Therefore, all object classes defined in this document conform to the
   IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages [BCP18].  
   
   Note:  For interoperability and consistent text display, values of
   attributes defined in this document:  (a) SHOULD be normalized as
   recommended in Unicode Format for Network Interchange [RFC5198]; (b) 
   SHOULD not contain DEL or any C0 or C1 control characters except for
   HT, CR, and LF; (c) SHOULD only contain CR and LF characters together
   (not as singletons); and SHOULD NOT contain HT, CR, or LF characters
   in names, e.g., printer-name and printer-aliases.  



9.  Security Considerations

   See [RFC4513] for detailed guidance on authentication methods for
   LDAP and the use of TLS/1.2 [RFC5246] to supply connection
   confidentiality and data integrity for LDAP sessions.  
   
   As with any LDAP schema, it is important to protect specific entries 
   and attributes with the appropriate access control.  It is
   particularly important that only administrators can modify entries
   defined in this LDAP Printer schema.  Otherwise, an LDAP client might
   be fooled into diverting print service requests from the original
   Printer (or spooler) to a malicious intruder's host system, thus
   exposing the information in printed documents.  
   
   Note:  Security vulnerabilities can arise if DEL or any C0 or C1
   control characters are included in names, e.g., printer-name or
   printer-aliases.  
   
   For additional security considerations of deploying Printers in an
   IPP environment, see Section 8 of [RFC2911].
