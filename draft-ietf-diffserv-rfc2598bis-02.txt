This document defines a PHB (per-hop behavior) called Expedited
Forwarding (EF).  The PHB is a basic building block in the
Differentiated Services architecture.  EF is intended to provide a
building block for low delay, low jitter and low loss services by
ensuring that the EF aggregate is served at a certain configured
rate.  This document obsoletes RFC 2598.

This document is a product of the Differentiated Services Working
Group of the IETF.

This document is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.  

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
should be sent to IETF-REQUEST@IETF.ORG.  Requests to be
added to or deleted from the RFC-DIST distribution list should
be sent to RFC-DIST-REQUEST@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.
