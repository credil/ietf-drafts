Abstract

   Open Shortest Path First stub neighbor is an enhancement to the
   protocol to support large scale of neighbors in some topologies with
   improved convergence behavior.  It introduces limited changes
   protocol behavior to implement a scalable solution for hub and spoke
   topologies by restricting the functionality changes to the hub.  The
   concepts are also applicable to a host running in a virtual machine
   environment.

1.  Introduction

   With the growing size of an Open Shortest Patch First (OSPF)
   [RFC2328] network, most large networks are now deploying OSPF in
   large hub and spoke topologies.  Also in lot of cases L3 routing
   would be extended to Top of rack or even to a host running virtual
   machines.

   In any case these remote devices constitute a stub point in an OSPF
   network.  These devices although being part of OSPF network will
   never be a transit point and thus do not need any topology
   information of the area nor do they require optimal routing
   calculations.

Internet-Draft             OSPF Stub Neighbors                 July 2013


   The spoke router in the case of a hub and spoke (or a host running
   OSPF) only need a default route to the rest of the network, but they
   do need to send information about the connected network in the local
   site.  In case of hosts they need to advertise routes inside of the
   virtual machines.

   OSPF as network protocol was designed for an environment where
   routers were of similar capabilities.  To protect the larger network,
   area hierarchy was introduced.  Network was typically broken up into
   a backbone area and several subordinate areas.  This breakup of the
   topology into areas serves multiple purposes

   As OSPF has become pervasive protocol in the enterprise network it
   needs to evolve for large hub and spoke setups, these are typical
   retail environments.  In a retail setup typical remote branch router
   does not have enough capacity to become part of a larger area, even
   if we break the network in large number of smaller areas.  A remote
   router in one retail store does not need to have routes to all the
   router in other retail store that are part of its area setup.

   Also increasing the number of areas on Area Border Routers(ABR) can
   burden the router due to the creation of large number of Summary Link
   State Advertisement (LSA).  Although this can be handled by creating
   the areas as stub with no summary.  Even by creating smaller sized
   areas with stub no summary, it does not completely eliminate the
   problem of having unnecessary information from the prospective of
   intra area.

   With the advent of virtualized hosts, hosts are now advertising an
   increasing number of new virtual machine routes.  These prefixes need
   to be advertised by a router that is connected to the host.
   Traditionally the host would be connected to the router via a shared
   link between the two (host and router).  The host is often sourcing
   subnets that are not connected to the common subnet between the host
   and routers.

   However, the hosts (or spokes) themselves just need a default route
   from the router(or hub) to reach rest of the network.

   The solutions using current features of the protocol are not
   scalable.  The overhead of protocol info and flooding of large number
   of unnecessary information to low-end routers caps the number of
   spokes on a hub.

                           Hub and Spoke Example

   This document describes extensions to OSPF to support very large Hub
   and spoke topologies more efficiently.  Currently, the spoke router
   receives unnecessary information from the neighboring hub routers
   about all the other routers in the area.  In most cases all a spoke
   router needs is IP reachability to hub routers which are the gateways
   to the rest of the network.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Incremental deployment

   For ease of deployment, the changes proposed in this document will be
   limited to the hub routers only.

   By limiting changes only to the hub router the feature can be
   incrementally introduced without upgrading other routers in the
   network.  Specifically, the spoke sites do not need to be upgraded.

   It will be the responsibility of the hub router to mask the changes
   from the spoke as well as rest of the OSPF network such that the
   upgrading the network is simple from the point of interoperability
   and ease of deployment.

   The hub router can be a normal router and there is no requirement for
   the hub to be a area border router or an autonomous system boundary
   router.  Hub site is a sort of passive listener.  It is there to
   receive routes from the spoke site, and to just provide exit towards
   rest of the network.  A hub router sends a default or aggregated
   route towards the spoke and filters out all the information about
   rest of the network from the spoke.

4.  Link State Advertisement Filtering

   Routers establish adjacencies to flood topological information.  The
   flooding process ensures all the information is consistent across the
   entire area and ensures the LSAs are delivered to all routers within
   the same area.

   From the protocol prospective topological information that is carried
   in the LSAs cannot be filtered, which it is essential to the loop
   free topology.

   The topological information learned, by all routers within an area
   build the consistent graph of the network connections.

   Today prefix aggregation can only be achieved using summary type 3 or
   type 5 LSA.  There is no way to limit or mask intra area information.
   The hub and spoke topologies or Data center cases, it would be
   beneficial to mask intra area information as it would not cause any
   loop.

4.1.  Area Border Router(ABR) Hub Routers

   Aggregation can be achieved at the ABR Hub router level using current
   features.  The aggregation can be done by either using ranges or the
   default route injected as a type 3 LSA.

4.2.  Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR) Hub Routers

   Similarly aggregation can be achieved at the ASBR Hub router level
   using current features.  The aggregation can be done by either using
   ranges or the default route injected as a type 5 or type 7 LSA.

4.3.  Other Hub Routers

   Currently there is no possibility of aggregating prefixes sent to the
   spoke routers which severely impacts the scale.  This document
   describes the extensions to the protocol to address these scale
   issues in section 5.

5.  Proposed Changes

5.1.  Stub neighbor overview

   We propose a new kind of adjacency for neighbors configured as stub.
   The local adjacency will have a modified flooding content as the stub
   router only need a gateway through its neighbor.  The hub router will
   send limited information to the remote spoke router without
   overwhelming the host with area topology.  Spoke nodes should be
   considered a stub node when the remote site needs to send only
   prefixes to rest of the OSPF network without being considered a
   transit node.

5.2.  Local Adjacency

   The local adjacency concept in only present on a hub router and it
   applies to those neighbors configured as stub neighbors.  In this
   case, the hub router will maintain the adjacency to stub neighbors as
   local only.

   The hub router will flood a simplified router LSA to its local
   adjacencies so as to mask the area topology behind it.  The Hub
   "Local" router LSA will contain only a p2p link to the stub neighbor
   when full adjacency is achieved and advertise one stub link with a
   configured range or the default prefix or both.  The Hub router will
   effectively hide all the area topology including the prefixes behind
   it.

   We are introducing a new type of default route with a local behavior.
   The current use of default route as type 3 or as type 5 cannot solve
   some of the use cases and more specifically in the Data center
   topologies.

   The spoke router will function as normal advertising all its
   connected prefixes to Hub router.

5.3.  Local Router LSA originated on the Hub Router

   The local Router LSA MUST contain at least 2 links.  One p2p link to
   the stub neighbor and a stub link to advertise the default prefix or
   a range defined per configuration.


   Example 1: Hub Local router-LSA for any area with default prefix

   LS age = 0                     ;always true on origination
   Options =           ;

         Hub Local router-LSA for any area with configured ranges

   A spoke router is usually a leaf node or in some cases may be in a
   dual-homed topology with another hub.  In these cases, both Hub
   routers MUST be configured to view the spoke as a stub neighbor.  The
   Local Router LSA of a Hub will get flooded over the other OSPF
   interfaces of a spoke router.  A Hub router MUST ignore local router
   LSAs from other Hub routers flooded by a stub neighbor.

6.  Demand Circuit

   Sections 4.1, 4.2 described how to reduce the amount of information
   flooded and increase scalability.  The use of Demand Circuit
   capability [RFC1793] can further enhance the scalability for some use
   cases.

   By making the spoke neighbors as demand circuit we will be able to
   suppress the refresh of all the routes we have learned from spoke
   sites.  Only incremental changes are flooded in the network.  Most
   networks have large number of spoke sites, in some large network
   there could be around 18-20K spoke sites each sending up to 3-5
   subnets.  Have to refresh these large number of LSAs can have
   unnecessary information flooded throughout large OSPF domain.

   Second type of spoke sites that are emerging are running over long
   distance wireless networks.  Sending periodic hellos for neighbor
   detection is not desired behavior in long distance wireless network.
   We do understand this can have convergence impact for the spoke that
   is dual homed.

7.  Benefits

   By making hub router define a stub neighbor we would be able to run
   OSPF in a true hub and spoke setup.  Where the router that connects
   to the network and has local routes that needs to be advertising to
   rest of the network does not have to know about the OSPF topology
   beyond its hub.

8.  Security Considerations

   This memo does not introduce any new security concerns or take any
   directed action towards improving the security of OSPF deployments in
   general.

9.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.
