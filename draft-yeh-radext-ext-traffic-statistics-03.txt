Internet-Draft        RADIUS Accounting Extensions             July 2012


1.  Introduction

   RADIUS has been widely used as the centralized authentication,
   authorization and user management method for the service provision in
   Broadband access network.  [RFC3162], [RFC4818] and
   [ietf-radext-ipv6-access-09] has specified some attributes to support
   the service provision for IPv6 access.  In the meantime, Radius is
   also a protocol for carrying accounting information between a Network
   Access Server and a shared accounting server.  In the scenarios of
   dual-stack or any other IPv6 transition use case, there is a demand
   to report the separated IPv4 & IPv6 traffic statistics for the
   differential accounting and traffic recording.

   [BBF TR-187], whose purpose is to describe the network architecture
   and elements requirements in the PPPoE scenario to support IPv6-only
   or dual-stack for Internet access service, explicitly expressed this
   demand in its section 9.4, that the BNG must also be able to support
   separate queues, input and output counters for IPv4 or IPv6 traffic.
   And it recommended to use the Radius attributes of Acct-Input-Octets
   (42), Acct-Output-Octets (43), Acct-Input-Packets (47), Acct-Output-
   Packets (48) for the combination of IPv6 and IPv4 traffic.  Note that
   BNG of BBF is a kind of broadband NAS of IETF.  The new RADIUS
   attributes for reporting the separated IPv4 or IPv6 traffic
   statistics are required.

   [draft-hu-v6ops-radius-issues-ipv6-00] presented the same issue on
   'protocol specific accounting' for the dual-stack traffic statistics,
   but it also limits to the PPP case.
   [draft-maglione-radext-ipv6-acct-extensions-01] and
   [draft-yeh-radext-dual-stack-access-02] tried to defined a batch of
   attributes on the traffic statistics respectively for the IPv6-only
   access and dual-stack access in the traditional type space with the
   flat mode , while [draft-winter-radext-fancyaccounting-00] indicated
   that the accounting attributes of Input-Octets, Output-Octets, Input-
   Packets and Output-Packets can be grouped in the new basic data type
   of TLV-nesting defined in the section 2.3 of
   [draft-ietf-radext-radius-extensions-06] for the extended type space.
   According to [RFC6158] and the section 6.3 of
   [draft-ietf-radext-radius-extensions-06], Nesting-TLV is the only
   recommendation for the new attribute design now, which intends to
   employ multiple fields in the complex data type.  Based on the judge
   of the quickly-exhausted traditional type space, the Radext Working
   Group tends to adopt the new data type of nesting-TLV defined for the
   extended type space to report the traffic statistics for the
   accounting extension.

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   This document describes some new RADIUS attributes and the associated
   usage on NAS and AAA server.  This document should be read in
   conjunction with the relevant RADIUS specifications, including
   [RFC2865], [RFC2866], [RFC2869], and
   [draft-ietf-radext-radius-extensions-06], for a complete mechanism.
   Definitions for terms and acronyms not specifically defined in this
   document are defined in [RFC2865], [RFC2866], [RFC2869], [RFC3575],
   [RFC6158], and [draft-ietf-radext-radius-extensions-06].

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].


3.  Deployment Scenarios

   Figure 1 show the typical use case of the traffic statistics
   reporting for the dual-stack users.

    | Customer |  ------------  |   NAS    |  ------------  |  Server  |
    |  Router  |      IPoE      |          |   Accounting   |          |

                         for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic

        Figure 1: Traffic Statistics of Dual-Stack Users for RADIUS
                                Accounting

   Note that traffic statistics reporting is also needed in the IPv6
   transition cases, such as DS-Lite, 6rd or the potential MAP, where
   AFTR (Address Family Transition Router) or BR (Border Router) acts as
   the broadband NAS.


4.  Acct-Traffic-Statistics attribute

   The attribute of Acct-traffic-statistics is designed according to the
   guidelines described in [RFC6158] and section 6 of
   [draft-ietf-radext-radius-extensions-06].  It adopts the data
   structure of the TLV nesting, has 1 container attribute, Acct-
   Traffic-Statistics, and 6 contained sub-attributes, Stack-Type,
   Input-Octets, Output-Octets, Input-Packets, Output-Packets, DSCP-Type
   (Differentiated Services CodePoint) to support the extensible types
   of traffic statistics.  The sub-attribute of Stack-Type must be

   included in the container attribute; one or more of Input-Octets,
   Output-Octets, Input-Packets or Output-Packets sub-attributes much be
   also included; while the sub-attribute of DSCP-Type is optional for
   the detailed specified traffic type in the container attribute.
   Because each of the sub-attributes has its own type code, the
   appearance of the contained sub-attributes is not necessary in a
   fixed order.

4.1.  Container attribute of Acct-Traffic-Statistics

   Description

      The container attribute of Acct-Traffic-Statistics, which includes
      sub-attributes of Stack-Type, or DSCP-Type, and Input-Octets,
      Output-Octets, Input-Packets or Output-Packets, reports how many
      octets or packets of the specified traffic type, from the user or
      sent to the user, from the starting of the associated service
      provided.  The sub-attributes of Stack-Type or DSCP-Type indicates
      the specified traffic type.  Acct-traffic-statistics can be
      presented in Accounting-Request(4) message while the Acct-Status-
      Type(40) is set to Interim-Update or Stop.

      A summary of the Acct-Traffic-Statistics attribute format is shown
      as below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

      attribute of Stack-Type, and one of Input-Octets, Output-Octets,
      Input-Packets or Output-Packets sub-attributes must be included.

4.2.6.  Acct-Traffic-Statistics.DSCP-Type

   Description

      The sub-attribute of Acct-Traffic-Statistics.DSCP-Type indicates
      the DSCP type of the separated or combined IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.

      A summary of the Acct-Traffic-Statistics.DSCP-Type attribute
      format is shown as below.  The fields are transmitted from left to
      right.

   Type

      TBA.6 for Acct-Traffic-Statistics.DSCP-Type (by IANA)

   Length

      6

   Value

      Enumerated Data Type in 4-Octet unsigned integer defined in
      [RFC6158].  The beginning 3 Octets are reserved for future use,
      and are set to 0x00 now.  The last 6 bits of the last octet is
      used to contain the DSCP value as per [RFC2474]


5.  Table of Attribute

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

   The meaning of the above table entries is as follows:

   0    This attribute MUST NOT be present.
   0+   Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present.
   0-1  Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present.
   1    Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present.
   1+   One or more of these attributes MUST be present.


6.  Diameter Considerations

   Given that the Attributes defined in this document are allocated from
   the RADIUS extended type space, no special handling is required by
   Diameter entities.


7.  Security Considerations

   Known security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol may apply to
   its attributes.  Security issues related RADIUS are described in
   section 8 of [RFC2865], section 5 of [RFC3162].


8.  IANA Considerations

   The authors of this document request to assign new Radius type codes
   for Acct-Traffic-Statistics and its following sub-attributes.

   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Stack-Type
   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Input-Octets
   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Output-Octets
   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Input-Packets
   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Output-Packets
   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.DSCP-Type

   These type codes should be allocated from the RADIUS extended type
   space based on section 10 of [draft-ietf-radext-radius-extensions-06]
   and "IETF Review" policy [RFC5226].


9.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Roberta Maglione, Jie Hu for their efforts in the history
   to bring this problem to IETF, Stefan Winter for his effort to
   introduce TLV in the attribute design, and Alan DeKok, Peter Deacon
   for their valuable comments in the mailing list of Radext.
