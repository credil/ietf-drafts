                 draft-nottingham-http-browser-hints-04

Abstract

   Over time, Web browsers have adapted how they use HTTP based upon
   common server configurations and behaviours.  While this is necessary
   in the common case, it can be detrimental for performance and
   interoperability.

   This document establishes a mechanism whereby origin servers can make
   available hints for browsers about their preferences and
   capabilities, without imposing overhead on their interactions or
   requiring support for them.

   This is intended to allow browsers to safely optimise connections to
   servers.

Internet-Draft             HTTP Browser Hints               October 2012


1.  Introduction

   HTTP [RFC2616] clients -- especially browsers -- typically use
   hardcoded values or heuristics to determine how many TCP connections
   to use to a server, based on common-case server behaviours and
   limitations.

   Likewise, they often send voluminous request headers (e.g., in User-
   Agent and Allow) because they fear that changing those headers'
   values will break some sites that depend upon specific values.

   These are just two examples of common, conservative behaviour by
   browsers that is good for interoperability, but potentially bad for
   performance in certain circumstances.

   This document specifies a mechanism whereby a HTTP server can
   advertise hints for browsers (and other clients), so that
   communication with them can be optimised.

   It does so by defining a file format for such Browser Hints
   Section 3, and defining how clients can discover it for a given Web
   site Section 4.  Finally, an extensible vocabulary of hints is
   defined Section 5.


2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  A file format for Browser Hints

   Browser hints are conveyed in a JSON [RFC4627] formatted file,
   containing a single object whose member's names are browser hints, as
   defined by the registry Section 7.3.

   For example;

   {
   "max-conns": 5,
   "small-hdrs": true
   }

   By their nature, all browser hints are optional; i.e., browsers are
   free to ignore them.

Internet-Draft             HTTP Browser Hints               October 2012


3.1.  The 'prefixlist' Value Type

   Each browser hint is defined to have a JSON-derived value type; e.g.,
   'string' or 'array'.  This section defines a special value type,
   'prefixlist' that is an array containing one or more arrays, each
   containing a path prefix followed by either 'true' or 'false' to
   indicate whether the hint applies to that path.

   Prefixlists are evaluated in order, with the first case-sensitive,
   character-by-character prefix match for a given URI's path
   determining whether the hint applies.

   For example, given the following hint document:

   {
     "omit-cookies": [
       ["/images/users/", false],
       ["/images/", true]
     ]
   }

   We can tell that "omit-cookies" applies to resources under the
   "/images/" path (such as "/images/123.jpg"), except for those under
   "/images/users/" (such as "/images/users/bob.jpg").

   If a value specified to be a prefixlist is either 'true' or 'false'
   that indicates that the hint applies to the whole site, or does not
   apply to the whole site, respectively.

   For example,

   {
     "omit-cookies": true
   }

   Indicates that the "omit-cookies" hint applies to the entire site.

   Prefixlists can only be used when the browser hint's registration
   nominates their use.


4.  Discovering Browser Hints for a Web site

   The hints relevant to a given site can be determined by fetching the
   URI path "/.well-known/browser-hints" for that site.

   Typically, clients (especially browsers) will not block other
   requests to a site while fetching the browser hints (because they're

   optional); instead, it will usually be done concurrently with other
   requests, or on idle connections for future use.

   In this specification, "site" is scoped by the URI scheme and
   authority.  As such, all of the following are considered to be
   different sites, and therefore have different browser hints:

   o  http://foo.com/
   o  https://foo.com/
   o  http://foo.com:8000/
   o  http://www.foo.com/

   Clients SHOULD follow HTTP 3xx redirects when retrieving hints.

   A successful response is valid for its associated site for as long as
   it can be cached in HTTP.

   If the response has a 200 status code but no explicit freshness
   (e.g., a Cache-Control: max-age or Expires: header), clients SHOULD
   cache the response heuristically for a generous fixed period (e.g.,
   14 days).

   If the response has a 404 status code but no explicit freshness,
   clients SHOULD cache the response heuristically for a generous fixed
   period (e.g., 14 days).

4.1.  Notifying Clients with the BH Response Header Field

   It is anticipated that Browser Hints will be used by some, but not
   all, Web sites.  Because clients might be reluctant to optimistically
   request the well-known URI, this document defines a new HTTP response
   header field, BH, to indicate that hints are available on a site.

   For example,

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/html
   Content-Length: 324
   BH: 1

   The presence of the BH header field in a response indicates that the
   origin associated with the effective request URI has a Browser Hints
   resource available at the well-known URI.

   The header field value MAY be "0" or "1".

   Origin servers that wish to indicate to clients that Browser Hints
   are available SHOULD include a BH header in all responses with a

Internet-Draft             HTTP Browser Hints               October 2012


   value of "1".

   Proxy servers that wish to suppress the use of certain Browser Hints
   MAY set (or reset) the BH header's value to "0".

4.2.  Interaction with HTTP Proxies

   Browser Hints are intended to optimise the connection between a
   client and the origin server.  However, HTTP allows proxies to be
   interposed between browsers and origin servers, meaning that careless
   use of some hints -- especially those that are connection-oriented --
   might not be applicable, and might even be harmful to the proxy.

   To mitigate these risks, some hints identify additional requirements
   for clients consuming browser hints when there is evidence of a proxy
   in use.

   A proxy is considered to be in use if:

   o  A proxy is explicitly configured by the client, or
   o  The BH response header field has a value of "0".

   Note that the presence of the Via header is not considered, because
   it can also be generated by intermediaries working on behalf of the
   origin server ("reverse proxies").

   Proxies MAY modify the value of the BH header field to be "0", or
   insert a BH header field with the value "0" if it is not present.
   Proxies MUST NOT modify a response so that the BH header field is "1"
   where it was previously not.


5.  Pre-defined Browser Hints

5.1.  max-conns

   o  Browser Hint Name: max-conns
   o  Description: When present, this hint indicates the maximum number
      of concurrent persistent connections that the site would like
      clients to use.
   o  Value Type: number
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net
   o  Notes: Not to be used when there is evidence of a proxy.

5.2.  pconn-ip

Internet-Draft             HTTP Browser Hints               October 2012


   o  Browser Hint Name: pconn-ip
   o  Description: When true, this hint indicates that the site allows
      clients to reuse persistent connections keyed by IP address,
      rather than by hostname.  Note that all sites that are sharing the
      connection MUST declare this hint for it to be used, and if a
      transport-layer certificate is in use (e.g., for TLS [RFC5246]),
      it MUST be valid for all sites.
   o  Value Type: true | false
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net
   o  Specification: [this document]
   o  Notes: Not to be used when there is evidence of a proxy.

   In other words, if both www.example.com and foo.example.org resolve
   to the address 192.0.2.5, and indicate this hint, then clients can
   send a request to www.example.com and then a request to
   foo.example.org on the same TCP connection to that address.

   If any of the sites grouped together for the purposes of pconn-ip
   declare a max-conns hint, the max-conns value for that address is
   considered to be the maximum of the declared max-conn hints present.

5.3.  ip-balance

   o  Browser Hint Name: ip-balance
   o  Description: When present, this hint indicates a preferred policy
      for clients to handle a DNS lookup that return multiple IPv4
      addresses for the site.
   o  Value Type: string
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net
   o  Notes: Not to be used when there is evidence of a proxy.

   Defined values include:

   o  round-robin - Use each IP address in succession, using the next
      address each time a new connection is opened.
   o  random - Use a random IP address from the list for each new
      connection.
   o  failover - Use the first IP address, falling back to the following
      address upon failure, and so forth.
   o  fastest - Attempt to connect to all IP addresses, using the
      fastest for this and subsequent connections.

5.4.  connect-timeout

   o  Browser Hint Name: connect-timeout
   o  Description: When present, this hint indicates how long the site
      wishes browsers to wait for a connection to be established, in
      seconds, before considering that connection unresponsive.

   o  Value Type: integer
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net
   o  Notes: Not to be used when there is evidence of a proxy.

5.5.  read-timeout

   o  Browser Hint Name: read-timeout
   o  Description: When present, this hint indicates how long the site
      wishes browsers to wait before considering a connection
      unresponsive, when data is outstanding (either a response or part
      thereof), in seconds.
   o  Value Type: integer
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net

   Note that requests on timed-out connections can be retried, subject
   to the constraints of HTTP.

5.6.  max-pipeline-depth

   o  Browser Hint Name: max-pipeline-depth
   o  Description: When present, this hint indicates the maximum number
      of pipelined requests per connection that the site would like
      clients to use.
   o  Value Type: number
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net
   o  Notes: Not to be used when there is evidence of a proxy.

5.7.  small-hdrs

   o  Browser Hint Name: small-hdrs
   o  Description: When true, this hint indicates that clients can omit
      the Accept and Accept-Charset request headers when communicating
      with the resource, and that they can use a shortened version of
      the User-Agent header.
   o  Value Type: prefixlist
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net

5.8.  relative-referer

   o  Browser Hint Name: relative-referer
   o  Description: When true, this hint indicates that servers prefer a
      relative URI in the Referer request header.
   o  Value Type: true | false
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net

5.9.  chunk-req-bodies

   o  Browser Hint Name: chunk-req-bodies
   o  Description: When true, this hint indicates that the server can
      successfully process a request with a chunk-encoded body; i.e.,
      that it should not return a 411 Length Required status.  Note that
      clients may still encounter a 411 response status, even in when
      this hint is present (e.g., a proxy).  When false, the server may
      or may not require a Content-Length on requests with bodies.
   o  Value Type: true | false
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net

5.10.  omit-cookies

   o  Browser Hint Name: omit-cookies
   o  Description: When true, this hint indicates that cookies [RFC6265]
      can be omitted in requests.
   o  Value Type: prefixlist
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net

5.11.  cookie-whitelist

   o  Browser Hint Name: cookie-whitelist
   o  Description: When present, indicates that the browser can omit any
      cookie [RFC6265] whose cookie-name is not a member of the value
      array.
   o  Value Type: array
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net


6.  Security Considerations

   TBD


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  The 'browser-hints' Well-Known URI

   This document defines the "browser-hints" Well-Known URI [RFC5785].

   o  URI suffix: browser-hints
   o  Change controller: mnot@mnot.net
   o  Specification document(s): [this document]
   o  Related information:

Internet-Draft             HTTP Browser Hints               October 2012


7.2.  The BH HTTP Response Header Field

   This document defines the "BH" HTTP header field, and registers it in
   the Permanent Message Headers registry.

   o  Header field name: BH
   o  Applicable protocol: HTTP
   o  Status: Informational
   o  Author/Change controller: Mark Nottingham, mnot@mnot.net
   o  Specification document(s): [this document]
   o  Related information:

7.3.  The HTTP Browser Hints Registry

   This document establishes the HTTP Browser Hints Registry.

   New hints are registered First Come First Served (see [RFC5226]), by
   sending e-mail to <mailto:iana@iana.org> (or using other mechanisms,
   as established by IANA).

   Registration requests MUST use the following template:

   o  Browser Hint Name: [name of hint]
   o  Description: [description of hint]
   o  Value Type: [JSON value type]
   o  Contact: [e-mail address(es)]
   o  Specification: [optional; reference or URI to more info]
   o  Notes: [optional]

   New hints MUST be optional; they cannot place requirements upon
   implementations.

   Likewise, new hints MUST be relevant to browser use cases; other non-
   browsing hints and metadata would make the hints response undesirably
   large.  However, note that non-browser clients MAY use them.

   Finally, new hints MUST NOT make communication non-conformant with
   HTTP itself; i.e., this is not a mechanism for changing the HTTP
   protocol in incompatible ways.  For example, if a hint indicates that
   browsers can compress request headers using GZIP, intermediaries that
   are interposed are likely to fail.

   The initial contents of the registry are defined in Section 5.
