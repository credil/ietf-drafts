1.  Overall Applicability

   Uniform Resource Name (URN) for emergency and other Well-Known
   Services are well defined within RFC5031 [2].  There are also
   existing proposals for automatic and manual ecall IN-Vehicles which
   defines their own URN's and additional procedures for vehicle
   specific eCalls.  Due to the existing telecommunication world and
   their implementations a combination of both is needed.  Due to the
   fact that only one URN can be used within the request line of a SIP
   Message a new approach is needed.  Therefore this document proposes
   to extend the existing URN's with an extension to reflect this.

   This draft should be seen as proposal which could be incoperated into
   draft-rosen-ecrit-ecall-10 [3] after discussing this approach

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].

3.  Overview

   RFC5031 [2] defines URN values for emergency calls.  The values for
   the SOS subtree are sos.ambulance, sos.animal-control, sos.fire,
   sos.gas, sos.marine, sos.mountain , sos.physician, sos.poison and
   sos.police [3]  proposes two additional URN for ecall. automatic and
   ecall.manual the sub-services 'sos' as specified in Section 4.2 of
   RFC5031 [2].

   Within the existing implementation in GSM networks for emergency call
   as specified in 3GPP TS 22.101 [4] the following requirements and
   code points are described:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   ---

Internet-DraUniform Resource Name (URN) extension for automat  July 2013


   It shall be possible to initiate emergency calls to different
   emergency call centers, depending on the type of emergency.  The
   following types of emergency calls shall be possible:

   o Police

   o Ambulance

   o Fire Brigade

   o Marine Guard

   o Mountain Rescue

   o Manually Initiated eCall

   o Automatically Initiated eCall

   ....

   It shall be possible to tie any emergency call number to any single
   emergency call type or to any combination of emergency call types.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------

   This means in practice that a emergency Call Center from police must
   differentiate between automatic and manual eCalls.  Same belongs to
   the other types like fire brigade Marine Guard ect.

   Requirement:

   Req-1: It shall be possible to tie a manually initiated eCall with
   different type of emergency type i.e. Police, Ambulance, Fire
   Brigade, Marine Guard and Mountain Rescue.

   Req-2:It shall be possible to tie a automatically initiated eCallC
   with different type of emergency type i.e. Police, Ambulance, Fire
   Brigade, Marine Guard and Mountain Rescue.

   These requirements will not allow a second different URN Format as
   described in draft-rosen-ecrit-ecall-10 [3].  This draft adds two
   additional URN urn:service:sos.ecall.manual and
   urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic Which allows to address the ecall
   itself.  But the requirement in 3GPP TS 22.101 [4] described will not
   be satisfied.  Therefor this document proposes an other format of the
   URN

4.  IANA Consideration

   IANA is requested to register the URNs described below under the sub-
   services 'sos' registry defined in Section 4.2 of RFC5031[2]

4.1.  sublabel for sos service and the related subservices

   An additional sublabel for sos and the 5 base values of police,
   ambulance, fire, mountain are defined.

   .ecall

   This sublevel indicated that an ecall has been triggered.

   .automatic

   This sublevel indicates that an eCall had been triggered
   automatically.  This could be a sensor-controlled measuring of heat
   or pressure in case of car accidents or fire situations.

   .manual

   This sublevel indicates that an eCall had been triggered based on the
   manual interaction of a person.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise security considerations beyond those
   described in RFC5031 [2].
