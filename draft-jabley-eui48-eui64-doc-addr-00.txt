     EUI-48 and EUI-64 Address Assignments for use in Documentation
                  draft-jabley-eui48-eui64-doc-addr-00

Abstract

   48-bit Extended Unique Identifiers (EUI-48) and 64-bit Extended
   Unique Identifiers (EUI-64) are address formats specified by the IEEE
   for use in various layer-2 networks, e.g. ethernet.

   This document describes an allocation of EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses
   under the IANA Organisationally Unique Identifier (OUI) to be used
   for the purposes of documentation.

Internet-Draft  EUI-48 and EUI-64 Documentation Addresses     March 2013


1.  Introduction

   48-bit Extended Unique Identifiers (EUI-48) [EUI48] and 64-bit
   Extended Unique Identifiers (EUI-64) [EUI64] are address formats
   specified by the IEEE for use in various layer-2 networks, e.g.
   ethernet.

   This document describes an allocation of EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses
   under the IANA Organisationally Unique Identifier (OUI) to be used
   for the purposes of documentation, in accordance with the guidelines
   and requirements for such allocations described in [RFC5342].

   As noted in [RFC5737], the use of designated address ranges for
   documentation and examples reduces the likelihood of conflicts and
   confusion arising from the use of addresses assigned for some other
   purpose.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  EUI-48 Addresses for use in Documentation

   The 256 unicast identifiers from 00-00-5E-XX-XX-XX to
   00-00-5E-XX-XX-XX have been allocated for use in documentation.

   The 256 multicast idenrifiers from 01-00-5E-XX-XX-XX to 01-00-5E-XX-
   XX-XX have been allocated for use in documentation.

   The 256 unicast identifiers from 00-00-5E-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX to 00-00-5E-

   The 256 multicast idenrifiers from 01-00-5E-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX to 01-00-
   5E-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX have been allocated for use in documentation.

5.  Guidance for Document Authors

   Documents which include literal EUI-48 or EUI-64 addresses, as
   examples or for other reasons, SHOULD choose addresses within the
   ranges described in Section 3 and Section 4.

   Where literal EUI-48 or EUI-64 addresses in a document are required
   to be part of a different allocation, e.g. for reasons specific to a
   particular protocol, authors MAY use addresses from ranges other than
   those specified in Section 3 and Section 4.

6.  Operational Implications

   Addresses within the ranges described in Section 3 and Section 4
   SHOULD NOT be used for any purpose other than documentation.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is directed to document the allocations described in
   Section 3 and Section 4 in the appropriate IANA Ethernet Numbers
   subregistry.
