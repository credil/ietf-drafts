      <t>These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-05 to
         draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-06. </t>
      <t><list style="numbers">
         <t>Only minor editorial and formatting changes were made to this
            document revision.  No substantive changes were made to
            the SMF-MIB module itself.</t>
       </list></t>

      <t>These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-04 to

      <t><list style="numbers">
         <t>Updated the smfInterfaceTable to reflect that fact that we want
            it to 'sparsely augment' the ifTable.</t>
         <t>Added a section to the text discussing the SMF Tables and their
            indexing.</t>
         <t>Added the section on 'Applicability Statement'.</t>
         <t>Added/checked for DEFVAL, REFERENCES, UNITS and SIZE
            clauses within the MIB.</t>
       </list></t>

         <t>Removed the bitmap switch in the notifications
                control group.</t>
         <t>Moved the notification Objects group up

                traps and SNMPv2 notifications.</t>
         <t>Removed reference to the notifications
                state group.</t>

            This is later used in the Notifications to indicate
            the origin of the event to the management station.</t>
         <t>Removed the Router Priority object as this was used
            only in the eCDS algorithm and hence should be contained
            within the future eCDS-MIB.</t>
         <t>Cleaned up the TEXTUAL CONVENTION for the
            `SmfOpMode'.</t>

          <t>Editorial changes to the textual material.  These included the
