This memo proposes an optional fast-track way to get from a working group
document to IESG review that can be used for cases when a working group chair
believes that there is open-source running code that implements a working group
Internet-Draft. The basic idea is to do all of working group last call, IETF
last call and area director review during the same two week period, and to
impose a higher barrier for comments that might block progress. The motivation
is to offer a reward for running code, consistent with the IETF's overall
philosophy of running code and rough consensus. This version is an initial
draft solely proposed by the author (and not the IESG) to attempt to ascertain
if there is enough interest in this to warrant trying out the idea as an RFC
3933 process experiment.

<section title="Introduction">

<t>

This is an initial
draft solely proposed by the author (and not the IESG) to attempt to ascertain
if there is enough interest in this to warrant trying out the idea as an <xref target="RFC3933"/> experiment.

</t>

<t>

The idea here is not to save the universe, nor to boil any oceans. WG's are
still liable to sometimes take years to get to the point where this "fastrack"
might apply. However, the author thinks that this is taking the IETF in the
right direction and so is worth a look. This approach might also help with
recent cases where smaller open-source software groups have found the IETF
process difficult for various reasons.

<section title="Fast-Track Processing">


<t>

Sometimes, it can take a long time to get a Proposed Standard
produced in the IETF. This memo proposes an optional way to 
speed up the parts of the process that happen after a working
group (WG) has done its job as a "reward" for having an 
open-source implementation available at that time.

</t>

<t>

There is probably no need to refer to <xref target="RFC2119"/>
here, but why not:-)

</t>

<t>

The basic idea is that a WG chair can choose to progress a WG
draft on the "fast-track" in some circumstances.  

</t>

<t>

When a document is being progressed on the fast-track, the
following changes from <xref target="BCP9"/> apply, and
define the new "fast-track last call" state:

<list style="numbers">

<t>Working group last call (WGLC), IETF last call (IETF-LC)
and Area Director (AD) review all run in parallel over the
same two-week period.</t>

<t>Only comments that would be "DISCUSS-worthy" according
to the IESG Discuss Criteria <xref target="DCRIT"/> need be
handled during last call. Other comments can be handled
or not, at the authors/editors discretion.</t>

<t>After fast-track last-call, the document must either
be returned to the WG, or else enter IESG review as
soon as any changes required are made. The 
relevant AD makes the decision as to whether changes
are required and when those are completed sufficiently
to move to the next stage.</t>

<t>As soon as the authors/editors have made any changes
required as a result of fast-track last-call, then the
document will enter IESG review and will be automatically
placed on the next IESG telechat agenda.</t>

<t>Given the fast-track processing, the relevant AD is
not expected to (but of course can) ballot "Yes" for the
document. Draft progression after IESG review is 
otherwise unaffected, so a "Yes" ballot is needed from
some AD.</t>

</list>

</t>

</section>

<section title="Fast-Track Rules">

<t>Some rules associated with this new fast-track are as follows:

<list style="numbers">

<t>Only a WG chair can choose to propose a draft from her working
group that is aimed for Proposed Standard for fast-track
processing.</t>

<t>Where there are two or more WG chairs, all need to agree
to fast-track processing.</t>

<t>An open-source implementation of the draft is required for
fast-track last-call. If there is no implementation or if the 
implementation is unavailable or does not implement the
draft sufficiently closely then the document needs to be returned to the WG.
Note: this only requires one implementation, not two.
</t>

<t>An AD can choose to accept the word of a WG chair that the
implementation is available and sufficiently accurate, or an
AD might choose to confirm this herself or via a third-party.</t>

<t>A document can only be proposed on the fast-track once. That is, if
the document comes back to the WG after having been proposed on the
fast-track, then normal processing must be used if that draft is to
be progressed subsequently.</t>

<t>WG chairs ought to provide sufficient notice to the relevant
AD that they will be using the fast-track last-call process and
should ensure that the AD has sufficient time to carry out a 
review of the draft during fast-track last call.</t>

<t>
This one is not a "rule" but where a WG chair indicates that
a work item is planned for fast-track processing, then the 
IESG and IAOC ought to try to accomodate requests for space
and other logistics to support this at IETF meetings. Of 
course, what is possible will depend on the venue and on
resources available and required, but the goal of the IETF
ought be to try to help the WG to get the document to the
point where fast-track processing can be done, which implies
helping the WG with efforts to develop the open-source
implementation required.

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>

Since this is proposed by a security AD something is 
clearly needed here. A WG chair and author could collude
to launch an 
attack
on the WG's AD by proposing a draft with code containing a
trojan. Not much fun or profit for anyone there though:-)
