Abstract

   Currently, TRILL solution can only provide optimum unicast
   forwarding just for Layer2 traffic of intra-subnet forwarding, not
   for Layer3 traffic(inter-subnet forwarding). In this document, a
   TRILL Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) solution is introduced
   to provide optimum unicast forwarding not just for Layer 2 traffic
   (intra-subnet forwarding), but also for Layer 3 traffic (inter-
   subnet forwarding). In the TRILL IRB scenario, an edge RB MUST
   perform the bridging function for the End Systems that are on the
   same subnet and the IP routing for the End Systems that are on the
   different subnets of same tenant.ESADI extension can be used for
   synchronizing <MAC, IP> correspondence among edge RBridges. To
   reduce the number of ESADI session among edge RBridges, Management 
   Data Label for ESADI is suggested to be used.

1. Introduction

The IETF has standardized the TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of
Lots of Links) protocol [RFC6325] that provides a solution for least
cost transparent routing in multi-hop networks with arbitrary
topologies and link technologies, using [IS-IS] [RFC6165] [RFC6326bis]
link-state routing and a hop count. TRILL switches are sometimes called
RBridges (Routing Bridges).

Currently, TRILL only provides optimum unicast forwarding for Layer 2
LAN traffic (intra-subnet forwarding), not for Layer 3 traffic (inter-
subnet forwarding).

In this document, a TRILL Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB)
solution is introduced to provide optimum unicast forwarding not just
for Layer 2 traffic (intra-subnet forwarding), but also for Layer 3
traffic (inter-subnet forwarding). In the TRILL IRB solution, the edge
RBridge provides a per tenant virtual switching and routing instance
with address isolation and Layer 3 tunnel encapsulation across the core.
The edge RBridge supports bridging among end stations that belong to
same subnet and routing among end stations that belongs to different
subnets of same routing domain.

This document is organized as follows: Section 3 describes why an
IRB solution is needed. Section 4 gives forwarding procedures. Section
5 describes TRILL protocol extensions to support TRILL IRB solution.

Familiarity with [RFC6325] and [ESADI] is assumed in this document.

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   Figure-1 depicts a Data Center Network (DCN) using TRILL where edge
   RB functionality resides in physical Top of Rack (ToR) switches.
   Centralized gateway (GW) nodes are provided not only for north-south
   bound L3 forwarding but also for east-west bound inter-subnet L3
   forwarding. If two end stations of same tenant are on two different
   subnets and need to communicate with each other, their packets need
   to be forwarded all the way to a centralized layer 3 GW so one of
   the GW devices can perform L3 forwarding. This is generally sub-
   optimal because the two end stations may be connected to the same
   TOR where L3 switching could have been performed locally. If an edge
   RB has IRB capability, then it can perform optimum L2 forwarding for
   intra-subnet traffic and optimum L3 forwarding for inter-subnet
   traffic, delivering optimum forwarding for unicast packets at all
   time.

                   Figure 2 Edge RB Model as default GW

   In a data center network (DCN), each tenant may include one or more
   IP subnets. Each IP subnet corresponds to one layer 2 virtual
   network and in normal cases each tenant corresponds to one routing
   domain (RD). One layer 2 virtual network (VN) maps to a unique IP
   subnet within a VRF context. Each layer 2 virtual network in a TRILL
   campus is identified by a unique 12-bit VLAN ID or 24-bit Fine
   Grained Label [FGL]. Different routing domains should have
   overlapping address space, distinct and separate routes. The end
   systems that belongs to the same subnet communicate through L2
   forwarding, end systems of same tenant that belongs to different
   subnet communicate through L3 forwarding.

   The above figure 2 depicts the model where there are N VRFs
   corresponding to N tenants with each tenant having up to M
   segments/subnets (virtual network).

4. Requirements of edge RB acts as default GW

   In the TRILL IRB scenario, an edge RB MUST perform the bridging
   function for the End Systems that are on the same subnet and the IP
   routing for the End Systems that are on the different subnets of
   same tenant. For L3 traffic edge RB must act as default GW for
   connected end systems that belongs to each routing domain.

Internet-Draft            TRILL Irb Solution                July 2013


   Each GW should establish a gateway interface and VRF for each
   routing domain. Each L2 VN maps to a unique IP subnet within a VRF
   context. Because the end systems in each routing domain may spread
   over multiple edge RBs, all these edge RBs should act as default GWs
   and have same gateway IP and MAC address for the connected end
   systems that belong to same routing domain. The default GW must
   satisfy following requirements:


   1, Support <MAC, IP> correspondence learning on each default GW. An
   edge RBridge can learn IP/MAC correspondence of locally attached end
   stations by inspecting the ARP message or other data frame. An end
   system uses the ARP/ND protocol to discover other end system MAC
   addresses if they are on the same subnet; An end system sends a
   packet to a known gateway if the destination of the packet is on
   different subnet from the sender end system and the end system uses
   ARP/ND protocol to find the gateway MAC address. When the default GW
   receives ARP/ND request packet from an access link, if destination
   IP in the packet is equals to the IP address of the default GW, it
   returns an ARP reply with self MAC and IP mapping information. After
   the end system acquires the MAC address of the GW, it will send
   unicast IP packets to destination end systems with destination MAC
   equals to the MAC of default GW, the default GW will perform L2
   termination and find routing table entry with destination IP to
   perform L3 forwarding for the unicast packet.

   2, Support <MAC, IP> correspondence synchronization for each routing
   domain among default GWs.

   For each tenant, there may be multiple L2 VNs and the end systems in
   each L2 VN may spread over multiple edge RBs. These edge RBs can
   only acquire the ARP/ND table for locally attached end systems. To
   support inter-subnet communication between locally attached end
   stations and remote end stations, the edge RB should have <MAC, IP,
   L2 VNID > mapping information for all remote end stations that are
   attached to all other edge RBs.

   So all edge RBs should synchronize ARP/ND table (i.e. MAC, IP, L2
   VNID for each local attached end systems) of local attached end
   systems to all other edge RBs that have the same routing domain.
   Similarly, when a ARP/ND table in an edge RB ages, the edge RB
   should flood the ARP/ND table flush event to all other RBs.

   After ARP/ND table synchronization is finished, all edge RBs keep
   all ARP/ND tables and install an IP forwarding table for all end

   systems in each VRF. After that, these edge RBs can support inter-
   subnet L3 forwarding for all end systems in each routing domain.

   3, Support L2 forwarding for intra-subnet traffic and L3 forwarding
   for inter-subnet traffic on each default GW.

   When ingress edge RB receives packets from local attached end
   station, the RB performs following process:

   1. The RB will check the destination MAC, if the destination MAC
      equals to default GW's MAC, the GW will perform L3 forwarding
      process. Otherwise, the RB will perform L2 forwarding process and
      jump to step 4.

   2. The RB will find IP forwarding table by destination IP to get the
      MAC and VN ID of destination end station.

   3. The RB will modify source MAC, destination MAC and VN ID of the
      packet. Source MAC is modified to GW's MAC, destination MAC is
      modified to destination end station's MAC, VN ID is modified to
      destination end station's VNID.

   4. The RB will perform L2 forwarding process by destination MAC in
      destination L2 VN ID and will get remote nickname by finding MAC
      table entry in destination L2 VN. Then it performs TRILL
      encapsulation and goes through optimal TRILL forwarding to the
      egress RB. After decapsulation at the egress RB, the packet will
      reach to destination end station.

   So when edge RBs support default GW function, optimum unicast
   forwarding will be performed not just for L2 traffic (intra-subnet
   forwarding), but also for L3 traffic (inter-subnet forwarding).In
   the TRILL IRB solution, edge RBridges are connected to each other
   via one or multiple RBridge hops, however they are always a single
   IP hop away.

5. Protocol extension to support <MAC, IP> correspondence
   synchronization

   Edge RBs that belong to same routing domain should synchronize their
   ARP/ND tables with each other. One routing domain may include
   multiple subnets and each subnet maps to a L2 VN ID. A possible
   solution to synchronize ARP/ND tables among edge RBs was described
   by [ESADI].

   each Data Label (VLAN or FGL). ESADI protocol can be extended to
   announce and learn end station ARP/ND tables amongst all edge RBs
   for each routing domain where edge RB acts as a default GW for local
   attached end stations.

   The Interface Addresses APPsub-TLV is used to indicate that a set of
   addresses on the same end-station interface and to associate that
   interface with the TRILL switch by which the interface is reachable.
   The TLV supports multiple address families and can be used to
   declare MAC and IPV4/IPV6 correspondence on each edge RBridge to
   TRILL campus.

   When an edge RBridge learns IP/MAC correspondence of a locally
   attached end station 1 by inspecting the ARP message or other data
   frame, it will use Interface Addresses APPsub-TLV and flood such
   information to all other edge RBs belonging to same routing domain.
   Edge RBs in the same routing domain must establish  ESADI sessions
   for each layer 2 network beforehand. When an edge RBridge receives
   Interface Addresses APPsub-TLV, it retrieves IPv4 and MAC mapping
   information of the end station and install it to its IP routing
   table in the corresponding VRF. After that, the end stations
   attached to the receiving edge RBridges can communicate to end
   station 1 through layer 2 and layer 3 forwarding procedures.

6. Management Data Label for ESADI
   
   As ESADI is a Data Label(VLAN or FGL) scoped solution, each edge
   RBridge needs to establish ESADI session for each L2 VN in a routing
   domain. Therefore the number of ESADI session is huge and is a big
   burden for each RBridge's CPU. So we suggest a management Data Label for 
   ESADI to be used for this purpose.
   
   Every RBridge should be configured with a globally unique management
   Data Label. RBridges establishes ESADI session using this management
   Data Label. In extreme case, we can use one management ESADI session
   for all routing domains. With this approach CPU consumption can be
   greatly reduced on every RBridge. The correspondence of management Data
   Label and L2 VNs can be statically configured on every RBridge.The
   operator must make sure the configuration consistency for all 
   RBridges. A new TLV is suggested to be defined in ESADI to synchronize
   ARP/ND tables for multiple L2 VN in one ESADI session.
