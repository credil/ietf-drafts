Internet-Draft            Trust Router Protocol             October 2011


1.  Introduction

   A Trust Router is an infrastucture element used to construct multihop
   Application Bridging for Federated Authentication Beyond the Web
   (ABFAB) federations, as discussed in
   draft-mrw-abfab-multihop-fed-01.txt.  This document defines both the
   Trust Router Protocol and the Trust Path Query, as discussed in the
   multihop federation document.

   This document defines the protocol used between Trust Routers to
   exchange information about Trust Paths available within an ABFAB
   federation.  It also defines the messages that a federated service
   will use to obtain Trust Path information from its local Trust
   Router, so that it can use the ABFAB Key Negotiation Protocol (KNP)
   to forge a Chain of Trust across a federation.  The Chain of Trust
   will lead to an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA)
   Server for a user's Identity Provider, which will then be used to
   authenticate and authorize the user.


2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Trust Router Protocol

   The Trust Router protocol is a TCP-based protocol that is used to
   exchange information between Trust Routers about available Trust
   Links within an ABFAB Federation.

   As discussed in the multihop federation document, When a Trust Router
   advertises a Trust Link, such as A(T) -> B(T), it is making an
   assertion that Trust Router A is able, and willing, to provide
   temporary identities (via KNP) that can be used to reach Trust Router
   B.

   Trust Routers use the information they receive about available Trust
   Links to construct Trust Paths that can be used to reach AAA Servers
   (i.e.  RADIUS or DIAMETER servers) for a set of Identity Providers
   (IDPs) within a ABFAB federation.  They then return the shortest path
   to a specific IDP in response to Trust Path Queries.

Internet-Draft            Trust Router Protocol             October 2011


4.  Trust Router Messages

4.1.  Hello Message

   Hello Messages are the first messages exchanged by Trust Routers when
   they bring up a new TCP connection, and they may be exchanged at
   other times to ensure that database information is synchronized, or
   to trigger a full Trust Link Database download.  The first Hello
   messages exchanged over a new TCP connection are also used as the
   vehicle to establish an authenticated and encrypted GSS-API session.

   TBD: We need to discuss how GSS-API will be used with this protocol.
   Maybe we need separate authentication messages before the Hello
   messages are exchanged?

4.2.  Trust Link Database Message

   A Trust Link Database Message contains a full (potentially filtered)
   set of Trust Links that can be reached through the sending Trust
   Router.  This message may be quite large, and is only sent when
   solicited by the receiver.

4.3.  Trust Link Update Message

   Trust Routers send Trust Link Update messages to other Trust Routers
   to whom they are connected whenever their Trust Link Database is
   updated.  Trust Link Update messages contain the portions of the
   Trust Link Database that have changed since the last update.  They
   also contain a serial number that can be used by the receiving Trust
   Router to determine if any updates have been missed, in which case a
   full Trust Router Database download is needed.


5.  Trust Router Operation

   This section describes how Trust Routers work, in general.  Detailed
   message formats are described in later sections of the document.

5.1.  Hello Message Exchange

5.2.  Exchanging Initial Trust Link Databases

5.3.  Trust Link Updates

5.4.  Serial Numbers

Internet-Draft            Trust Router Protocol             October 2011


5.5.  TCP Connection Handling

   Trust Routers communicate by exchanging full JSON-encoded messages
   over a TCP connection.  If incomplete messages are received, or if
   the TCP connection is interrupted before a complete message is
   received, the incomplete messages will be discarded, and no protocol
   actions will be taken based on the contents of the incomplete
   message.

   In the Trust Router Protocol, no information about the availability
   of Trust Links is inferred from a TCP reset, or a retransmission
   timeout on the TCP connection to another Trust Router.  A Trust
   Router is only considered unreachable after an attempt to reestablish
   a TCP connection to that Trust Router is reset or times out.

   When a Trust Router is found to be unreachable, the Trust Links
   supplied by that Trust Router are not removed from the local Trust
   Link Database.  They will however, be marked as deprecated until a
   connection can be reestablished with the Trust Router that sent them,
   and it can be verified that the sequence number of that Trust
   Router's Database still matches the sequence number of the most
   recent Trust Link information received.

   When Trust Links are marked as deprecated, they will not be used if
   another, non-deprecated path exists to reach the target Identity
   Provider.  If there are no paths to the target Identity Provider that
   traverse only non-deprecated Trust Links, a path containing a
   deprecated Trust Link will be used.

7.  Message Representation

   This section provides details about the contents and encoding of both
   Trust Router Protocol messages and Trust Path Query messages.

7.1.  Message Encoding

   The Trust Router Protocol and Trust Path Query messages are encoded
   in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627].

7.2.  Hello Message Representation

   Name or Realm (??)  Auth-Token (??)  Database-Serial-Number Database-
   Request

   TBD: It is unclear what sort of authentication information needs to
   be in this message for GSS-API authentication.

   Database-Serial-Number field contains the current serial number of
   the sending Trust Router's Trust Link Database.  This information may
   be used by a receiving Trust Router to determine whether it should
   request a full Trust Link Database download.

   The Database-Request field indicates whether the receiving Trust
   Router should respond to this message with a Trust Link Database
   message, to share its full Trust Link Database with the sending Trust
   Router.  If this field has a value of "true", a download is
   requested.  If it is "false", a download is not requested.

7.3.  Trust Link Database/Update Representation

   In the Trust Router Protocol, each Trust Router will send a
   (potentially filtered) set of Trust Links to its neighboring Trust
   Routers.  The representation of these Trust Links is designed for
   efficient encoding, and to allow easy population of a conceptual
   Trust Link Table on the receiving Trust Router.  Each Trust Router
   will only distribute a set of Trust Links that form a connected tree
   rooted at the sending Trust Router.

   Conceptually, a Trust Link consists:

   o  A Trust Router that is willing to provide a temporary identity.

   o  The Trust Router or AAA Server which the identity can be provided

   o  The Communities-of-Interest to whom the link is available.

Internet-Draft            Trust Router Protocol             October 2011


   o  A lifetime for this link, in seconds.

   However, the actual Trust Links passed in the Trust Router protocol
   rely on inference and ordering to eliminate the need to include the
   first Trust Router identity in each distributed link.  Instead, we
   use an Index variable, which indicates each Trust Link's level in a
   conceptual tree, and we order the Trust Links, so that a Trust Link
   with an Index of N is subordinate to the closest previous Trust Link
   with an index of N-1 that applies to the same Community-of-Interest.
   Each conceptual tree is rooted at the sending Trust Router, which is
   represented by an an entry with an Index value of 0.

7.3.1.  Trust Link Ordering

7.3.2.  Entity Identity

   When we send Trust Router or AAA Server identities in the Trust
   Router Protocol, that information will be sent in an Entity Identity
   structure containing the following fields:

   o  Name

   o  Type

   o  Realm

   The Name field will typically contain a fully-qualified domain name
   (FQDN) that can be used to reach the indicated entity (e.g. "tr-
   A.example.net").

   The Type field indicates that the entity is a Trust Router (Type =
   "T") or a AAA Server (Type = "R", "D", or "S" for a RADIUS Server,
   DIAMETER Server or RADSEC Server, respectively).

   The Realm field contains the security realm associated with the
   entity (e.g. "example.net").

7.3.3.  Trust Link Entry

   As transmitted in the Trust Router Protocol, a Trust Link entry will
   have the following fields:

   o  Index

   o  Target-Entity

   o  Communities-of-Interest

Internet-Draft            Trust Router Protocol             October 2011


   o  Lifetime

   The Index field contains a non-zero integer value, indicating the
   depth of this Trust Link in a conceptual tree of links rooted at the
   sending Trust Router.  The maximum value of this field is 255.

   The Target-Entity field contains a the Trust Router or AAA Server for
   which temporary identities can be generated.  This also represents
   the Trust Router that can generate identities for any directly
   subordinate nodes in the conceptual tree.

   The Communities-of-Interest field contains an array of strings, each
   containing a Community-of-Interest for which this link is available.

   The Lifetime field contains an integer that indicates the lifetime of
   this Trust Link in seconds.  Links are removed from the the
   conceptual Trust Link Table if their lifetime expires.

7.3.4.  Trust Link Database Message

   A Trust Link Databases will consist two fields:

   o  Serial-Number

   o  Trust-Links

   The Serial-Number field contains an integer indicating the version of
   the information contained in this database.  The maximum value for
   this field is (2^32 - 1).

   The Trust-Links field contains an array of Trust Link Entries.

7.3.5.  Trust Link Update Message

7.4.  Trust Path Query Representation

7.4.1.  Trust Link Query Request

   TBD: Pending resolution of open architectural questions regarding
   what will be queried/returned in these messages.

7.4.2.  Trust Link Query Response

   TBD: Pending resolution of open architectural questions regarding
   what will be queried/returned in these messages.
