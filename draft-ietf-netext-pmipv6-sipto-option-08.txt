       IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector Option for Proxy Mobile IPv6
              draft-ietf-netext-pmipv6-sipto-option-08.txt

Abstract

   This specification defines a traffic offload mechanism and a related
   mobility option for carrying IPv4 Offload traffic selectors between a
   mobile access gateway and a local mobility anchor in a Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 domain.  Based on the negotiated IPv4 traffic offload flow
   selectors with the local mobility anchor, a mobile access gateway can
   enable offload traffic rule on the selected IPv4 flows.

Internet-Draft    IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector Option      January 2013


1.  Introduction

   Mobile Operators are expanding their network coverage by integrating
   various access technology domains (Ex: Wireless LAN, CDMA, LTE) into
   a common IP mobility core.  The 3GPP S2a Proxy Mobile IPv6 [TS23402]
   reference point, specified by the 3GPP system architecture defines
   the protocol inter-working for building such integrated multi-access
   network.  In this scenario, the mobile node's IP traffic is always
   tunneled back from the mobile access gateway [RFC5213] in the access
   network to the local mobility anchor in the home network.  Currently,
   there is no mechanism for allowing some of the subscriber's IP flows
   to be offloaded in the access network.

   With the exponential growth in the mobile data traffic, mobile
   operators are exploring new ways to offload some of the IP traffic
   flows at the nearest access edge.  The offload is intended either for
   local service access in the access network, or for internet offload
   through the access network when there is an internet peering point.
   Not all IP traffic flows needs to be routed back to the home network,
   some of the non-essential traffic which does not require IP mobility
   support can be offloaded at the mobile access gateway in the access
   network.  This approach allows efficient usage of the mobile packet
   core which helps in lowering transport costs.  The local mobility
   anchor in the home network can deliver the IP flow policy to the
   mobile access gateway in the access network, for identifying the IP
   flows that need to be offloaded.  It's a policy decision as to which
   traffic an operator deems as non-essential.  One operator might
   choose to offload everything except traffic (such as Voice over IP)
   that requires QoS services.  Another might choose to offload only
   HTTP traffic.  From the point of view of this specification, it is
   only about IPv4 traffic matching a given flow selector and
   classification for offload.  This approach has one limitation with
   respect to identifying encrypted traffic: IPsec encrypted traffic
   with no visibility into the application payload cannot be selected
   for offload.

   This document defines a new mobility option, IPv4 Traffic Offload
   Selector option Section 4 for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  This
   option can be used by the local mobility anchor for delivering the
   IPv4 traffic offload policy associated with a mobility session to the
   mobile access gateway.  This IPv4 traffic offload policy identifies
   the flow selectors that can used for selecting the flows for
   offloading them at the access edge.  Since, the mobile node's IP
   address topologically belongs to the home network, the offloaded IPv4
   traffic flows may need to be NAT [RFC2663] translated.  These
   offloaded flows will not have mobility support as the NAT becomes the
   anchor point for those flows.  However, when the traffic is offloaded
   for local service access as opposed to internet offload, NAT

   translation may not be needed, if the mobile access gateways is in
   path for the return traffic.  The decision on when to apply NAT
   translation can be based on local configuration on the mobile access
   gateway.  There are better ways to address the offload problem for
   IPv6 and with the goal not to create NAT66 requirement, this
   specification therefore does not support traffic offload support for
   IPv6 flows.  An IPv6 enabled mobile node can be assigned multiple
   IPv6 prefixes, some from the access network and the other from the
   home network.  If there is proper prefix coloring marking in the
   Router Advertisement messages, which allows the mobile node to
   identify the IPv6 prefix assigned from the local access network, the
   mobile node can choose to use an address from that prefix for IP
   traffic flows that require offload.  There is active work
   [I-D.bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix]
   [I-D.korhonen-dmm-prefix-properties] in IETF for addressing the
   prefix coloring related enhancements.  This document also does not
   define any new semantics for flow selectors.  The flow identification
   and the related semantics are all leveraged from [RFC6088] and
   [RFC6089].

2.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications
   [RFC5213] and [RFC5844].  Additionally, this document uses the
   following terms:

   IP Flow

      IP Flow [RFC5101] represents a set of IP packets that match a
      traffic selector.  The selector is typically based on the source
      IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port
      and other fields in upper layer headers.

   IP Traffic Offload

      The approach of selecting specific IP flows and routing them
      through the access network, instead of tunneling them to the home
      network.  Offload can also be between two access networks
      (Example: moving some of the traffic from LTE access to WLAN
      access).


3.  Solution Overview

   The following Figure 1 illustrates the scenario where the mobile
   access gateway in an access network has enabled IPv4 traffic offload
   support for a mobility session.  The offload decision is based on the
   IPv4 traffic offload policy that it received from the local mobility
   anchor in the home network.  For example, all the HTTP flows may be
   offloaded at the mobile access gateway and all the other flows for
   that mobility session are tunneled back to the local mobility anchor.
   The offloaded flows have to be typically NAT translated and this
   specification does not impose any restrictions on the location of the
   NAT function.  It is possible for the NAT function to be co-located
   with the mobile access gateway or located somewhere in the edge of
   the access network.  When the NAT is not co-located on the mobile
   access gateway, the NAT function should have the ability to identify
   the offloaded IP traffic for NAT policy enforcement.  This could be
   achieved by configuring a specific VLAN between the mobile access
   gateway and the NAT device and ensuring all the traffic on that VLAN
   is NAT translated.  This can also be achieved through other means and
   the details are outside the scope of this document.  It is also to be
   noted that the NAT translation is not required if the offloaded IPv4
   flows are for local service access.

   The IPv4 traffic selectors that are delivered to the mobile access
   gateway can be used to classify the traffic, so it can be offloaded
   to the access network.  The parameters in the IP traffic selectors
   can be used to match against the header fields in the data packets.
   These parameters include Source IP address, Destination IP address,
   TCP/UDP Port numbers, and other fields.  The format of the IPv4
   Binary Traffic Selector is specified in section 3.1 of [RFC6088].

3.1.  LMA Considerations

   The following considerations apply to the local mobility anchor.

   o  If the configuration variable, EnableIPTrafficOffloadSupport
      (Section 6) on the local mobility anchor is set to a value of (0),
      then the local mobility anchor SHOULD NOT include the IPv4 Traffic
      Offload Selector option (Section 4) in the Proxy Binding
      Acknowledgement message.  It MUST ignore any IPv4 Traffic Offload
      Selector option present in the received Proxy Binding Update and
      process the rest of the message as per [RFC5213].  This would have
      no effect on the operation of the rest of the protocol.

   o  If the received Proxy Binding Update includes the IPv4 Traffic
      Offload Selector option (Section 4), and if the configuration
      variable, EnableIPTrafficOffloadSupport (Section 6) on the local
      mobility anchor is set to a value of (1), then the local mobility
      anchor can acquire the offload policy from a network function (Ex:
      AAA, or PCRF (Policy Charging and Rules Function)) and can
      construct the traffic selectors based on the offload policy and
      deliver that traffic offload policy in the Proxy Binding
      Acknowledgement message using the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector
      option.  The specific details on how the offload policy for a
      mobile node is provisioned on the local mobility anchor is out of
      the scope for this document.  However, if the received Proxy
      Binding Update included a proposed Offload traffic policy, the
      local mobility anchor MAY choose to honor that request and reflect
      the proposed selectors in the reply, or may override them by
      sending its traffic selectors in the reply message.

   o  If the received Proxy Binding Update does not include the IPv4
      Traffic Offload Selector option (Section 4), and if the
      configuration variable, EnableIPTrafficOffloadSupport (Section 6)
      on the local mobility anchor is set to a value of (1), then the
      local mobility anchor SHOULD NOT include the IP Traffic Offload

      Selector option in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement.

3.2.  MAG Considerations

   o  If the configuration variable, EnableIPTrafficOffloadSupport on
      the mobile access gateway is set to a value of (0), then the
      mobile access gateway SHOULD NOT include the IPv4 Traffic Offload
      Selector option (Section 4) in the Proxy Binding Update message
      that it sends to the local mobility anchor.

   o  If the configuration variable, EnableIPTrafficOffloadSupport on
      the mobile access gateway is set to a value of (1), then the
      mobile access gateway SHOULD include the IPv4 Traffic Offload
      Selector option (Section 4) in the Proxy Binding Update message.
      The following considerations apply with respect to including the
      Traffic Selector Sub-option in the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector
      option.

      *  The mobile access gateway MAY choose not to propose any
         specific IPv4 traffic offload policy.  In that scenario, there
         MUST NOT be any Traffic Selector sub-option in the IPv4 Traffic
         Offload Selector option.  Including the IPv4 Traffic Offload
         Selector option in the Proxy Binding Update without the Traffic
         Selector Sub-option serves as an indication that the mobile
         access gateway is not proposing any specific offload policy for
         that mobility session, but rather it indicates a request to the
         local mobility anchor to provide the IPv4 traffic offload flow
         selectors for that mobility session.  The (M) flag Section 4 in
         the option MUST be set to value of (0).

      *  The mobile access gateway MAY choose to propose a specific IPv4
         traffic offload policy to the LMA by including the Traffic
         Selector sub-option in the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option
         Section 4.  This IPv4 traffic offload policy may be locally
         configured at the mobile access gateway, or may have been
         obtained from the AAA.  When this policy is included in the
         Proxy Binding Update message, it serves as a proposal to the
         local mobility anchor, which the local mobility anchor can
         override with its own offload policy, or agree to the proposed
         policy that it received from the mobile access gateway.  When
         including the offload traffic selectors, the Traffic Selector
         sub-option MUST be constructed as specified section 4.2.1.4 of
         [RFC6089].  This sub-option includes a Traffic Selector Format
         field, which identifies the format of the flow specification
         included in that sub-option.  The values for that field and the
         corresponding message format are defined in section 3.0 of
         [RFC6088]

Internet-Draft    IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector Option      January 2013


   o  Lack of a IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option in the
      corresponding Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message received by
      the mobile access gateway in response to a Proxy Binding Update
      indicates that the local mobility anchor did not enable IPv4
      Traffic Offload support for that mobility session, and hence the
      local mobility anchor did not deliver IPv4 flow selectors for that
      mobility session.  The mobile access gateway upon accepting the
      Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message MUST NOT enable any IPv4
      traffic offload support for that mobility session.  All the mobile
      node's IPv4 flows MUST be tunneled back to the local mobility
      anchor.

   o  If there is an IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option in the
      corresponding Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message, the mobile
      access gateway SHOULD enable the IPv4 traffic offload support for
      that mobility session.  It MUST process the Traffic Selector Sub-
      option for the flow selectors.

      *  If the (M) flag of the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option in
         the received Proxy Binding Acknowledgement is set to a value
         (0), then the mobile access gateway SHOULD offload all the
         mobile node's IPv4 flows identified using the flow selectors
         present in the Traffic Selector Sub-option.  The mobile access
         gateway SHOULD tunnel all other mobile node's IPv4 flows to the
         local mobility anchor.

      *  If the (M) flag of the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option in
         the received Proxy Binding Acknowledgement is set to a value
         (1), then the mobile access gateway SHOULD offload all the
         mobile node's IPv4 flows, except the IPv4 flows identified
         using the flow selectors present in the Traffic Selector Sub-
         option.

   o  If the configuration variable EnableIPTrafficOffloadSupport is set
      to a value of (0) and the mobile access gateway has not included
      the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option in the Proxy Binding
      Update, but has received a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message
      that has the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option, then the mobile
      access gateway SHOULD ignore the option and process the rest of
      the message as per [RFC5213].


4.  IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector Option

   A new mobility option, IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option, is
   defined for using it in Proxy Binding Update (PBU) and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement (PBA) messages exchanged between a mobile access
   gateway and a local mobility anchor.  This option is used for

   carrying the IPv4 traffic offload policy.  This policy identifies the
   IPv4 traffic flow selectors that can be used by the IPv4 traffic
   offload function at the mobile access gateway.

   The alignment requirement for this option is 4n.

   Type
      <IANA-1>

   Length
      8-bit unsigned integer indicating the length in octets of the
      option, excluding the type and length fields.

   Reserved
      This field is unused for now.  The value MUST be initialized to 0
      by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Offload Mode Flag
      This field indicates the offload mode.

         If the (M) flag value is set to a value of (0), it is an
         indication that the identified IPv4 flow(s) in this mobility
         option SHOULD be offloaded at the mobile access gateway and all
         other IPv4 flows associated with that mobility session need to
         be tunneled to the local mobility anchor.

         If the (M) flag value is set to a value of (1), it is an
         indication that all the IPv4 flows associated to that mobility
         session except the identified IPv4 flow(s) in the Traffic
         Selector sub-option that follows SHOULD be offloaded at the
         mobile access gateway.

   Traffic Selector Sub-option
      The traffic selector sub-option includes the parameters used to
      match packets for a specific flow binding.  The traffic selector
      sub-option includes the parameters used to match packets for a
      specific flow binding.  The format of the Traffic Selector sub-
      option is defined in section 4.2.1.4 of [RFC6089].  This sub-
      option includes a TS Format field, which identifies the format of
      the flow specification included in that sub-option.  The values
      for that field are defined in section 3 of [RFC6089] and are
      repeated here for completeness.  When the value of TS Format field
      is set to (1), the format that follows is the IPv4 Binary Traffic
      Selector specified in section 3.1 of [RFC6088] and that support is
      mandatory for this specification.

         1: IPv4 binary traffic selector.

         2: IPv6 binary traffic selector (Not used by this
         specification)


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following IANA action.

   o  Action-1: This specification defines a new mobility option, IPv4
      Traffic Offload Selector option.  This option is described in
      Section 4.  The Type value for this option needs to be assigned
      from the same numbering space as allocated for the other mobility
      options [RFC6275].

   o  RFC Editor: please replace <IANA-1> in Section 4 with the assigned
      value, and update this section accordingly.


6.  Protocol Configuration Variables

   This specification defines the following configuration variable that
   controls the IPv4 Traffic Offload support feature.  The mobility
   entities, local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway MUST
   allow these variables to be configured by the system management.  The
   configured values for these protocol variables MUST survive server
   reboots and service restarts.

         This flag indicates whether or not IPv4 Traffic Offload support
         needs to be enabled.  This configuration variable is available
         at both in the mobile access gateway and at the local mobility
         anchor.  The default value for this flag is set to (0),
         indicating that the support for IPv4 Traffic offload support is
         disabled.

         When this flag on the mobile access gateway is set to a value
         of (1), the mobile access gateway MUST enable the IPv4 Traffic
         offload support for all mobility sessions, specifically it MUST
         request the IPv4 traffic offload policy from the local mobility
         anchor by including the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option in
         the Proxy Binding Update message.  If the flag is set to a
         value of (0), the mobile access gateway SHOULD NOT enable IPv4
         Traffic Offload support for any mobility session.  It SHOULD
         NOT include the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option in the
         Proxy Binding Update.

         Similarly, when this flag on the local mobility anchor is set
         to a value of (1), the local mobility anchor MUST enable
         support for IPv4 Traffic offload support.  When the local
         mobility anchor chooses to enable IPv4 Traffic offload support
         and if there is offload flow policy specified for a mobile
         node, it SHOULD deliver the IPv4 traffic offload policy to the
         mobile access gateway by including the IPv4 Traffic Offload
         Selector option in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message.


7.  Security Considerations

   The IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option defined in this
   specification is for use in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement messages.  This option is carried like any other
   mobility header option as specified in [RFC5213].  Therefore it
   inherits from [RFC5213] its security guidelines and does not require
   any additional security considerations.  Carrying IPv4 traffic
   offload selectors does not introduce any new security
   vulnerabilities.

   When IPv4 traffic offload support is enabled for a mobile node, the
   mobile access gateway selectively offloads some of the mobile node's
   IPv4 traffic flows to the access network.  Typically, these offloaded
   flows get NAT translated and essentially that introduces certain
   vulnerabilities which are common to any NAT deployment.  These
   vulnerabilities and the related considerations have been well
   documented in the NAT specification [RFC2663].  There are no
   additional considerations above and beyond what has already been
   documented by the NAT specifications and which are unique to the
