                Prefix Delegation for Proxy Mobile IPv6
                      draft-ietf-netext-pd-pmip-03

Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 enables IP mobility for a host without requiring
   its participation in any mobility signaling, being the network
   responsible for managing IP mobility on behalf of the host.  However,
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 does not support assigning a prefix to a router and
   managing its IP mobility.  This document specifies an extension to
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol for supporting network mobility using
   DHCPv6-based Prefix Delegation.

Internet-Draft   Prefix Delegation for Proxy Mobile IPv6       July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] enables an IPv6 host to move within a
   PMIPv6-Domain without requiring its participation in any IP mobility
   signaling.  However, PMIPv6 does not support providing a network-
   based mobility service to a complete network which is roaming within
   a PMIPv6-Domain without requiring the mobile router of that network
   to run the Network Mobility Basic Support protocol [RFC3963].

   In order to support network mobility in Proxy Mobile IPv6, the IPv6
   prefix used by the mobile network should be topologically anchored by
   the local mobility anchor.  DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation [RFC3633]
   (DHCPv6-PD) can be used to assign mobile network prefix(es) to a
   mobile router (MR) as specified in DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation for
   Network Mobility (NEMO) [RFC6276].  However, Proxy Mobile IPv6, as
   specified in [RFC5213], does not provide mobility support to a
   network behind a mobile router attached to a PMIPv6-Domain, as the
   PMIPv6 network entities (i.e., mobile access gateway and local
   mobility anchor) are not aware of the prefix(es) used by the nodes
   behind the mobile router.  This document describes how DHCPv6 prefix
   delegation can be used by a mobile router attached to a PMIPv6-Domain
   to obtain prefix(es) managed by the local mobility anchor, and the
   extensions required to PMIPv6 to support the mobility of the
   prefix(es).

2.  Convention and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [RFC6275], Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 specification [RFC5213], DHCPv6-PD for NEMO [RFC6276], DHCPv6-PD
   [RFC3633] and Mobility Related Terminology [RFC3753].  This document
   also provides a context-specific explanation to the following term
   used in this document.

   Mobile Router (MR)

      Throughout this document, the term mobile router is used to refer
      to an IP router whose mobility is managed by the network while
      being attached to a PMIPv6-Domain.  The mobile router is not
      required to participate in any IP mobility related signaling for
      achieving mobility for an IPv6 prefix that is obtained in that
      Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.

3.  DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation for Proxy Mobile IPv6

3.1.  Assumptions

   This specification extends Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) to assign a
   mobile network prefix to a mobile router (MR) for supporting network
   mobility.  The specification assumes that a mobile router is a
   regular IPv6 router without mobility management support.  The mobile
   router forwards outgoing packets from its mobile network to the
   mobile access gateway (MAG), and the MAG delivers the incoming
   packets to the mobile network via the MR.

   In order to use DHCPv6-PD as mobile network prefix assignment
   mechanism in PMIPv6-Domain, this specification makes the following
   assumptions.

   o  The mobile router MUST be able to function as a requesting router
      (RR; acts as a DHCPv6 client).

   o  The delegating router (DR; acts as a DHCPv6 server) function MUST
      be co-located with the LMA.

   o  A DHCPv6 Relay Agent (DRA) function (as described in [RFC5213])
      MUST be used by the mobile access gateway to be able to intercept
      the related DHCPv6 message sourced from the mobile router.

   o  The mobile router MUST have obtained a Home Network Prefix (HNP)
      from the PMIPv6-Domain before initiating a DHCPv6-PD procedure.
      In case of stateful address configuration, the prefix delegation
      MAY be performed simultaneously while configuring the Mobile Node
      Home Address (MN-HoA).

   o  The MR (acting as a RR) SHOULD support Prefix Exclude Option for
      DHCPv6-PD as described in [RFC6603].

3.2.  Network Mobility Service

   The network mobility service of a mobile router is indicated by the
   policy profile defined in [RFC5213].  During the mobile router's
   initial attachment procedure, the mobile access gateway MUST identify
   the mobile router and SHOULD acquire the policy profile to determine
   whether the network mobility service is offered to the mobile router.
   If the network mobility service needs to be offered to the mobile
   router, the mobile access gateway MUST set the Mobile Router Flag (R)
   when sending the Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message to the local
   mobility anchor.

    Figure 1: Prefix Delegation in PMIPv6 during the initial attachment
                           to the PMIPv6 Domain

   The steps required to complete the delegation of IPv6 prefix(es) to a
   mobile router that is provided with network mobility service are the
   following (see Figure 1):

   1.   The PMIPv6 tunnel is set up between the MAG and the LMA as
        described in [RFC5213].  This requires the MAG to send a regular
        PBU to the LMA to register the location of the mobile router and
        set-up the bi-directional tunnel.  The LMA binds the allocated
        home network prefix (HNP) to the Proxy-CoA of the mobile router
        (i.e., the address of the mobile access gateway where the MR is
        attached to).

Internet-Draft   Prefix Delegation for Proxy Mobile IPv6       July 2012


   2.   The mobile router, acting as a "Requesting Router" as described
        in [RFC3633], sends a DHCPv6 SOLICIT message including one or
        more IA_PD option(s) to the mobile access gateway (which has a
        "DHCPv6 Relay Agent" function) to acquire the delegated
        prefix(es).

   3.   Upon receiving the DHCPv6 SOLICIT message, the mobile access
        gateway sends a proxy binding update (PBU) message to the local
        mobility anchor, including a Mobile Network Prefix (MNP)
        mobility option as defined in Section 4.3 of [RFC3963].  All the
        considerations from Section 5.3.1 of [RFC5213] MUST be applied
        on the encapsulated Proxy Binding Update message.  If the mobile
        access gateway does not know the delegated prefix, then the
        mobile network prefix in the MNP option MUST be set to the
        unspecified address "::" and the prefix length to 0.  The local
        mobility anchor either assigns the MR a new delegated prefix or
        returns an existing one.

   4.   On reception of the proxy binding update, the local mobility
        anchor returns the assigned prefix in a MNP option conveyed in a
        proxy binding acknowledgment (PBA) message sent to the mobile
        access gateway, unless the prefix included in the PBU was the
        IPv6 unspecified address "::".  The assigned prefix MUST be the
        same one that will be assigned via DHCPv6PD in step 6.  This
        prefix MUST be added to the delegated prefix(es) in the local
        mobility anchor binding cache which is extended as described in
        Section 3.5.1.

   5.   The DHCPv6 Relay Agent function on the mobile access gateway
        relays the DHCPv6 SOLICIT message to the delegation router (as
        described in [RFC3315] ).  The delegating router inserts one or
        more IA_PD option(s) including the delegated prefix(es) in the
        reply message.

        Note: steps 6 to 9 are not present if DHCPv6 Rapid Commit is
        used.

   6.   The delegating router sends the delegated prefix(es) in one or
        more IA_PD(s) to the mobile access gateway (acting as "DHCPv6
        Relay Agent") inside the DHCPv6 ADVERTISE message.

   7.   The mobile access gateway relays the DHCPv6 ADVERTISE message to
        the mobile router.

   8.   The mobile router sends the DHCPv6 REQUEST message with the
        IA_PD option(s) received from previous message to the mobile
        access gateway (which is acting as "DHCPv6 Relay Agent").

Internet-Draft   Prefix Delegation for Proxy Mobile IPv6       July 2012


   9.   The DRA function on the mobile access gateway relays the DHCPv6
        REQUEST message to the DR.

   10.  The DR function on the local mobility anchor responds to the
        REQUEST from the mobile access gateway with a DHCPv6 REPLY
        message.

   11.  The RR function on the mobile router receives one or more IA_PD
        prefix(es) in the DHCPv6 REPLY message sent by the mobile access
        gateway.

3.3.2.  Refreshing the Delegated Prefix in Proxy Mobile IPv6

   When the mobile router sends DHCPv6 Renew messages to extend the
   lifetime of the delegated prefix, these messages are also intercepted
   by the mobile access gateway (acting as "DHCPv6 Relay Agent") and are
   relayed to the local mobility anchor (which is acting as "Delegating
   Router").

3.3.3.  Deletion of the Delegated Prefix in Proxy Mobile IPv6

   If the lifetime of the delegated prefix (included in the IA_PD Prefix
   Option carried by the DHCPv6 Reply message) is set to zero, the
   mobile access gateway MUST send a proxy binding update message to
   remove the binding for that mobile network prefix.

3.4.  Mobile Access Gateway Operation

3.4.1.  Extension to Binding Update List Entry Data Structure

   In order to support this specification, the conceptual Binding Update
   List Entry (BULE) data structure needs to be extended with a new
   prefix information field as [RFC3963] does.  This field is used to
   store the mobile network prefix assigned to the mobile router, which
   is included in the proxy binding acknowledgment.

3.4.2.  Forwarding

   Forwarding packets sent to the MR's mobile network prefix:

   o  On receiving a packet from the bi-directional tunnel established
      with the local mobility anchor, the mobile access gateway MUST
      first decapsulate the packet (removing the outer header) and then
      use the destination address of the (inner) packet to forward it on
      the interface through which the destination mobile network prefix
      is reachable.

   Forwarding packets sent by the mobile router:

Internet-Draft   Prefix Delegation for Proxy Mobile IPv6       July 2012


   o  On receiving packets from a mobile router connected to one access
      link, the mobile access gateway MUST ensure that there is an
      established binding for the mobile router and the local mobility
      anchor for the source mobile network prefix before tunneling the
      packet to the MR's local mobility anchor.

   Other considerations from Section 6.10.5 of [RFC5213] also apply
   here.

3.4.3.  Handover

   When the mobile router moves from the previously attached mobile
   access gateway to the target MAG, the newly attached mobile access
   gateway MAY know the mobile network prefix which was assigned to the
   mobile router during the previous attachment.  It is out of scope of
   this specification how the new mobile access gateway could obtain the
   previously assigned mobile network prefix (e.g., from some network
   element such as the previous MAG).  After moving to the new MAG, a
   proxy binding update message including the assigned mobile network
   prefix (if available) MUST be sent by the MAG to the LMA.  The local
   mobility anchor MUST check the mobile network prefix included in the
   PBU message and return the same assigned mobile network prefix in the
   proxy binding acknowledgment message.  If the previously assigned
   mobile network prefix is not known by new MAG, the mobile network
   prefix MUST be set to unspecified address "::" and the prefix length
   MUST be set to 0 in the proxy binding update message sent by the new
   mobile access gateway to the local mobility anchor.  In this case,
   the local mobility anchor MUST return the same previously assigned
   mobile network prefix in proxy binding acknowledgment message.

3.5.  Local Mobility Anchor Operation

3.5.1.  Extension to Binding Cache Entry Data Structure

   In order to support this specification, the conceptual Binding Cache
   Entry (BCE) data structure needs to be extended with a new prefix
   information field as [RFC3963] does.  This field is used to store the
   delegated mobile network prefix assigned to the mobile router and
   included in the proxy binding update (as described in Section 3.2).

3.5.2.  Forwarding

   Intercepting packets sent to the MR's mobile network prefix:

   o  When the local mobility anchor is serving the mobile router, it
      MUST be able to receive/intercept packets destined to the network
      behind the mobile router.  In order to receive these packets, the
      local mobility anchor MUST be the topological anchor of the MR's

      mobile network prefix(es).

   Forwarding packets to the mobile router:

   o  On receiving a packet from a correspondent node with the
      destination address matching the MR's mobile network prefix(es),
      the local mobility anchor MUST forward the packet through the bi-
      directional tunnel set up with the mobile router.

   Other considerations from Section 5.6.2 of [RFC5213] also apply here.

   The security considerations for DHCPv6 described in the "Security
   Considerations" section of the DHCPv6 base specification [RFC3315],
   the "Security Considerations" of the DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation
   specification [RFC3633], and the security considerations from the
   base Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] apply when using the extensions
   defined in this document.

   The use of DHCPv6, as described in this document, requires message
   integrity protection and source authentication.  The IPsec security
   mechanism mandated by Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] SHOULD be used to
   secure the DHCPv6 signaling between the mobile access gateway and the
   local mobility anchor.  In the following, we describe the Security
   Policy Database (SPD) and Security Association Database (SAD) entries
   necessary to protect the DHCPv6 signaling.  We use the same format
   used by [RFC4877].  The SPD and SAD entries are only example
   configurations.  A particular mobile access gateway implementation
   and a local mobility anchor implementation could configure different
   SPD and SAD entries as long as they provide the required security of
   the DHCPv6 signaling messages.

   For the examples described in this document, a mobile access gateway
   with address "mag_address_1", and a local mobility anchor with
   address "lma_address_1" are assumed.

      mobile access gateway SPD-S:
        - IF local_address = mag_address_1 &
             remote_address = lma_address_1 & proto = UDP &
             local_port = any & remote_port = DHCP
          Then use SA1 (OUT) and SA2 (IN)

      mobile access gateway SAD:
        - SA1(OUT, spi_a, lma_address_1, ESP, TRANSPORT):
              local_address = mag_address_1 &
              remote_address = lma_address_1 &
              proto = UDP & remote_port = DHCP
        - SA2(IN, spi_b, mag_address_1, ESP, TRANSPORT):
              local_address = lma_address_1 &
              remote_address = mag_address_1 &
              proto = UDP & local_port = DHCP

      local mobility anchor SPD-S:
        - IF local_address = lma_address_1 &
             remote_address = mag_address_1 & proto = UDP &
             local_port = DHCP & remote_port = any

          Then use SA2 (OUT) and SA1 (IN)

      local mobility anchor SAD:
        - SA2(OUT, spi_b, mag_address_1, ESP, TRANSPORT):
              local_address = lma_address_1 &
              remote_address = mag_address_1 &
              proto = UDP & local_port = DHCP
        - SA1(IN, spi_a, lma_address_1, ESP, TRANSPORT):
              local_address = mag_address_1 &
              remote_address = lma_address_1 &
              proto = UDP & remote_port = DHCP

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document reuses the mobile network prefix mobility option
   defined in [RFC3963] to convey in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling the
   prefix(es) assigned via DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation.  It does not
   introduce any additional IANA considerations.
