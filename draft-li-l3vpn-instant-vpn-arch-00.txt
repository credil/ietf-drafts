Abstract

   With the wide application of cloud computing technology, more and
   more enterprises will hire public cloud data center resources, reduce
   their own costs.  Providers need to enterprise data center rental
   network and enterprise own network connected together, provide
   enterprise lease line services.  L3VPN is most providers provide this
   service selection.  New VPN line business needs to rapidly deploy,
   but the current technology cannot meet this requirement.  This
   document introduces the architecture to deploy L3VPN rapidly which
   can satisfy the requirement for service provision.

Internet-Draft       An Architecture of Instant VPN         October 2013


1.  Introduction

   Enterprise leased line is one of the provider's principal business.
   Many providers are currently using L3VPN technology to provide this
   type of service, and with the development of cloud computing, the
   public cloud data centers will provide network service for a large
   number of enterprises and the provider's network need deploy massive
   L3VPNs in a short time.  But the current L3VPN deployment has
   following problems to be unable to meet fast deployment requirements.

   1.  The deployment of an L3VPN need to configure the VPN instance and
   tunnel on PE nodes.  If an L3VPN has a lot of access points, many PE
   nodes need to be configured and creation of tunnels will become
   complicated.  For data centers to support massive tenants, the PE
   nodes need to configure massive VPNs.  The configuration work will be
   huge and error-prone.

   2.  The L3VPN deployment need to configure RD, RT, etc. which need
   complex unified planning and design.

   3.  For enterprise lease line services , providers and enterprises
   need to plan ahead between CE and PE IP address and routing
   protocols, and enterprise CE position changes, need to reconfigure
   the corresponding PE.

   This document defines an architecture of instant L3VPN to deploy
   L3VPN fast which is achieved by central control.

2.  Terminology

   VPN: Virtual Private Network

   CE: Customer Edge Router

   PE: Provider Edge Router

   MP-BGP: Multiprotocol BGP

   RT: Route Target

   RD: Route Distinguisher

   EAP: Extensible Authentication Protocol

   RADIUS: Remote Authentication Dial In User Service

   I2RS: Interface to The Internet Routing System

3.  Requirement

   This chapter describe requirements of rapid deployment of L3VPN for
   cloud computing scenarios from the point of view of the enterprise
   and the provider:

   For enterprises:

   Requirement 1: Enterprise users can apply for VPN services from
   providers through web pages.

   Requirement 2: Enterprise users can have access to the VPN network at
   any position.

   Requirement 3: When the position of the enterprise's CE can be
   changed, configuration after migration need not to be changed and CE
   can still access L3VPN network real time.

   Requirement 4: Enterprises can define access strategy between any two
   CEs.

   Requirement 5: Enterprises can define the bandwidth and other
   constraints between any two CEs.

   Requirement 6: Enterprises can apply for virtual machine resources
   from provider data center, and the virtual machine can quickly access
   the enterprise L3VPN networks.

   For providers:

   Requirement 1: Providers can deploy VPN service rapidly according to
   business requirements of the enterprise.

   Requirement 2: Providers can do for enterprise user authentication,
   authorization, and accounting functions.

   Requirement 3: Providers can manage all VPN, including viewing each
   VPN's CE ID, PE address which CE access to, the tunnel state
   information between PEs, etc., and can provide enterprises with a VPN
   SLA reports.

4.  Architecture

   The architecture of Instant VPN is shown in the following figure.
   There is a VPN controller in the network to directly control all PE
   devices.  This document focuses on the VPN deployment in one AS.  The
   central control architecture for the inter-AS VPN will be described
   in the future version.

Internet-Draft       An Architecture of Instant VPN         October 2013


5.2.  VPN User Authentication Process

   Step 1: CE initiates VPN service request to PE automatically ,
   carrying the VPN ID, CE ID, CE password.

   Step 2: PE receives the authentication request and sends the
   authentication request to VPN Controller.

   Step 3: VPN Controller receives and processes the authentication
   request through the VPN Authentication module based on the
   information input by the enterprise users.

   Step 4: If the authentication passes, VPN Controller sends
   authentication success message to PE, carrying information: VPN ID,
   CE ID, the routing protocol between CE and PE, the CE IP address and
   mask, the PE IP address and mask, the CE AS number and PE AS number
   if routing protocol is BGP.

   Step 5: PE decapsulates authentication success message.  If the
   routing protocol between CE and PE is BGP, PE's own AS number and IP
   address will be encapsulated in an authentication success message and
   sent to CE.

5.3.  VRF Instance Configuration

   Step 1: After the CE authentication passes, VPN Authentication module
   informs VPN User Management module.

   Step 2: VPN User Management module creates an VRF instance for the CE
   user, automatically generating VRF RD, import RT and export RT
   information.

   Step 3: VPN User Management module sends VRF configuration
   information to the corresponding PE.

   Step 4: PE receive the VRF configuration from VPN controller, and
   create VRF automatically, binding VRF with the interface which CE
   access to.

5.4.  Route Protocol Configuration Between PE and CE

   Step 1: After the CE user authentication passes, VPN User Management
   gets the routing protocol information between CE and PE and
   automatically generates the routing protocol configuration of the PE.
   If the BGP protocol runs between the CE and the PE, the CE's IP
   address and AS number are also required.  If the enterprise define
   the access strategy, also generates the route policy configuration.

Internet-Draft       An Architecture of Instant VPN         October 2013


   Step 2: VPN User Management sends the configuration to PE to compete
   the configuration automatically.

   Step 3: After the CE receives the authentication success message from
   PE, it can get the route protocol type between CE and PE.  If the
   protocol is BGP, it can also get the PE's IP address and AS number
   from the message.  Then the CE can complete the routing configuration
   automatically.

5.5.  VRF Route Distribution

   Step 1: BGP peers establish automatically between the PE and the VPN
   Controller.

   Step 2: CE advertises its routes to PE.

   Step 3: PE advertises the routes which are received from CE to the
   VPN controller.  VPN controller processes the routes through VPN
   Route Management module.

   Step 4: VPN Route Management module receives VRN routes of all on-
   line CE and calculate routes for each VRF according to the VRF RT
   value.

   Step 5: In the controller the enterprise users can configure specific
   policy for each CE or PE to control the route distribution, such as
   the removal of specific routing prefixes.

   Step 6: VPN Controller advertises the VRF routes to the corresponding
   PE.

   Step 7: PE receives and installs the VRF routes.  Then the PE sends
   routes to CE.

5.6.  VPN Tunnel Establishment

   If the enterprise user does not define the bandwidth and other
   constraints between CEs, the tunnel for the VPN can use LDP or GRE,
   VXLAN and other types of tunnels.  If the enterprise users define the
   bandwidth or other constraints between CEs, MPLS TE tunnel can be
   used.

   Based on VRF RT information of PEs, VPN controller determine the
   tunnels which should be set up among these PEs of the VPN.

   When a new CE is online, VPN Controller will send the PE lists to a
   specific PE.  The PE lists determines the tunnels which the specific
   PE need to set up to these PEs.  In addition, the tunnel type can

   also be advertised to the PE.  If MPLS TE tunnel is used, the MPLS TE
   constraint for the tunnel can also be advertised.  When the PE
   received the PE list, it should establish the tunnel with the other
   PE members specified by the PE list.

6.  Protocol Extension Requirements

6.1.  Authentication Between CE and PE

   Needs to be extended as follows:

   1.  The authentication request message need carry the VPN ID
   information, CE ID, CE password information.

   2.  The authentication response message need carry the route protocol
   between CE and PE, the IP address and mask of CE, if route protocol
   is BGP, also need carry the IP address PE, the CE AS number and the
   PE AS number.

6.2.  Authentication Between PE and VPN Controller

   Needs to be extended as follows:

   1.  The authentication request message need carry the VPN ID
   information, CE ID, CE password information.

   2.  The authentication response message need carry the route protocol
   between CE and PE, the IP address and mask of CE, the IP address and
   mask of PE, if route protocol is BGP, also need carry the CE AS
   number and the PE AS number.

6.3.  Configuration Distributed from VPN Controller to PE

   Needs to be extended as follows:

   1.  VRF configuration, including VRF name, VRF RD, VRF RT.

   2.  The route protocol configuration, including protocol process
   number, route policy etc.

6.4.  Tunnel Information Distributed from VPN Controller to PE

   Needs to be extended as follows:

   1.  PE members list information which VRF accessed to.

   2.  The tunnel type, tunnel constraint information if MPLS TE is
   used.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   In this solution, the main need to consider the security between CE
   and PE communication, PE and VPN Controller, in the existing protocol
   already has good mechanism, this paper does not introduce in detail.
