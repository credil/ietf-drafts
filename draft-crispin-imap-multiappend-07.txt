This document describes the multiappending extension to the Internet
Message Access Protocol (IMAP) (RFC 3501).  This extension
provides substantial performance improvements for IMAP clients which
upload multiple messages at a time to a mailbox on the server.

A server which supports this extension indicates this with a
capability name of "MULTIAPPEND".

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.
