       A Policy Framework for the Interface to the Routing System
                  draft-atlas-irs-policy-framework-00

Abstract

   A key aspect of the Interface to the Routing System (IRS) is what
   mechanisms it includes to carry policy information and to enable
   policy control.  This applies both in the protocol itself and in the
   sub-interfaces associated with the different components of the
   routing system.  Similarly, the data-models associated with the sub-
   interfaces must be capable of expressing the appropriate granularity
   for access and authorization-related policy.  This document describes
   the policy framework for IRS.

Internet-Draft            IRS Policy Framework            September 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Interface to the Routing System (IRS) provides read and write
   access to the information and state that enable the routing
   components of routing elements.  The IRS is introduced and described
   in [I-D.atlas-irs-problem-statement] and [I-D.ward-irs-framework].

   Policy helps provide filters and control on the level of access to
   information and state that is enabled by individual protocol
   interactions.  A clear view of the policy features desirable at the
   IRS is important to shape the architecture and requirements for the
   protocols and sub-interfaces of the IRS.  Policy can be explicitly
   defined or implicitly assumed in a system, and can be enforced by
   that system's rules and behavior.  Since IRS provides sub-interfaces
   to routing sub-systems that already have policy defined (implicitly
   or explicitly), it is important to consider the existing policy
   mechanisms and how an IRS sub-interface should interact with them.

   IRS policy has four different aspects that need to be considered.

   1.  Policy related to the IRS protocol interactions between different
       systems.

   2.  Policy related to the interaction between the IRS Agent and the
       local system to which the IRS Agent is providing an interface.

   3.  Sub-interface policy to support scope and influence restrictions
       and to preserve necessary policy associated with the related
       routing sub-system.

   4.  Policy that can be installed or read via a sub-interface's data-
       model that is associated with the related routing sub-system.


2.  Terminology

   The following memorable terminology is used in this document.

   agent or IRS Agent:   An IRS Agent provides the supported IRS sub-
      interfaces to the local system's routing sub-systems.  The IRS
      Agent understands the IRS protocol and can be contacted by
      commissioners.

   commissioner:   A commissioner speaks the IRS protocol to communicate
      with IRS Agents and uses the IRS sub-interfaces to accomplish a
      task as instructed by the commissioner's local application.  A
      commissioner can be seen as the part of an application that
      supports IRS and could be a software library.

Internet-Draft            IRS Policy Framework            September 2012


   scope:   The set of information which the particular IRS entity
      (agent or commissioner) is authorized to read.  This access
      includes the permission to see the existence of data and the
      ability to retrieve the value of that data.  In the context of an
      interaction between a commissioner and an agent, the effective
      scope is restricted to the intersection of the scopes of the two
      entities.

   influence:   The set of field values which the particular IRS entity
      (agent or commissioner) is authorized to install.  This access can
      restrict what fields can be modified or created, and what specific
      value sets and ranges can be installed.  In the context of an
      interaction between a commissioner and an agent, the effective
      influence is restricted to the intersection of the influences of
      the two entities.

   resources:   A resource is an IRS-specific use of memory, storage, or
      execution that a commissioner may consume due to its IRS
      operations.  The amount of each such resource that a commissioner
      may consume in the context of a particular agent can be
      constrained.  Examples of such resources could include: the number
      of installed operations, number of operations that haven't reached
      their start-time, etc.  These are not protocol-specific resources
      or network-specific resources.

   role or security role:   A security role specifies the scope,
      influence, resources, precedence values, etc. that a commissioner
      or agent has.

   identity:   A commissioner is associated with exactly one specific
      identity.  State installed by a particular identity is owned by
      that identity; state ownership can not be transferred.  It is
      possible for multiple communication channels to use the same
      identity; in that case, the assumption is that the associated
      commissioner is coordinating such communication.  Similarly, an
      agent is associated with a specific identity.


3.  General IRS Policy

   IRS needs its own implicit and explicit policy.  This section
   articulates some of the those key concepts and policy decisions.  The
   IRS policy applies to interactions between the agent and
   commissioners and between the agent and the local system.

   The agent's externally perceivable behavior and associated policy is
   a key aspect of IRS that must be described.  The commissioner's
   behavior and functionality is specifically out-of-scope except where

   it needs to be described with respect to the agent's behavior and the
   IRS protocol.

            Figure 1: Architecture of commissioners and agents

   As can be seen in Figure 1, a commissioner can communicate with
   multiple agents.  The application associated with a commissioner may
   have multiple tasks it is accomplishing (separate functions, short-
   term versus longer-term, etc) and each such task may involve a set of
   agents which may or may not differ.

   As can also be seen in Figure 1, an IRS Agent may communicate with
   multiple commissioners.  Each commissioner may send the agent a
   variety of install operations.  The set of install operations
   received by an agent may overlap and conflict.  No simple protocol or
   policy mechanisms by an agent can completely avoid indirect
   interactions between different install operations.  The functional
   partitioning between the different commissioners must be done to
   avoid undesirable indirect interactions.

3.1.  Policy between commissioner and agent

   Multiple commissioners can communicate with the same agent.  The
   agent must have policies to manage the resulting complexity.
   Implicit policy includes the assumptions about communication between
   the commissioner and agent.  Explicit policy includes mechanisms to
   arbitrate between different commissioners, between operations of the
   same commissioner, and to manage state owned by an commissioner
   inside the agent.

3.1.1.  Identity

   By definition, a commissioner is associated with exactly one
   identity.  An agent will store data that is owned by a particular
   commissioner, based upon that commissioner's identity.  Since a
   commissioner can communicate via multiple transport channels and no
   channel needs to be active for the agent to have associated state,
   the commissioner's identity is used to identify the ownership of the
   data stored by the agent.

   Similarly, by definition, an agent is associated with exactly one
   identity.  An commissioner may also store local state associated with
   a particular agent.  The agent's identity can be used to identify
   ownership of the data stored by the commissioner.

   The details of what constitutes an identity can be dependent upon the
   specifics of the IRS protocol and selected security mechanisms.
   However, there are some critical considerations for identity that do
   impose constraints.

   An identity is not tied to a single communication channel.  A
   commissioner may use multiple IP addresses; an identity should not be
   tied to a specific IP address.  If the commissioner or agent is
   associated with a system that may be mobile, that should be
   considered in its identification.  Finally, the syntax and semantics
   for identifiers used for a commissioner and for an agent may be
   different.

3.1.2.  Security Role

   In the context of an agent, each commissioner will have a security
   role.  The commissioner's identity and associated security role will
   have to be verified via an acceptable security mechanism.  A variety
   of such mechanisms are anticipated to meet different security and
   operational objectives.  Example mechanisms might include a role
   assertion from the commissioner to the agent that the agent can
   cryptographically verify or having the agent to use an already
   trusted protocol to verify the commissioner's security role and

Internet-Draft            IRS Policy Framework            September 2012


   identity.

   An agent must know the scope, influence, and resources associated
   with each particular security role.  This information may vary across
   different agents even in the same network or it may be consistent
   across different agents in the same network.  The latter can be
   enforced by having a commissioner that is authorized to influence the
   meta-data model of security roles on the relevant set of agents.

   A security role also defines what precedence values (See
   Section 3.1.8) a commissioner can use.

3.1.3.  Security Model

   As described above, roles identify the scope, influence, and
   resources allowed to an IRS Commissioner.  The policy model therefore
   needs to include these roles.  The question of the bindings of
   identities to roles, and the selection of identities are protocol
   specific matters outside the scope of this document.

   The policy model for roles needs to address two dimensions.  It needs
   to create the roles themselves.  This should allow for use of
   techniques like inheritance, presumably with some rules on how role
   definitions can augment or restrict the inherited definitions.

   The security model also needs to define, by reference to the policy
   model itself, the scope and influence of the role.  The question of
   defining the resources of a role is for further study.  The role
   definition needs to indicate what types and instances of data can be
   observed and what information about those instances entities with
   that role can observe.  The security model also needs to define which
   data items can be modified, and what modifications (ranges, specified
   values, or other assertions that must be met) are permitted.

3.1.4.  Scope and Influence

   Scope and influence are specified as part of a security role.  A
   security role may be defined and managed in an external repository,
   centralized within an administration.  The security role definitions
   must be accessible to an agent.

   In the context of an interaction between a commissioner and an agent,
   the effective scope or influence is restricted to the intersection of
   the scopes or influence of the two entities.

   What information a particular commissioner is authorized to read is
   known as the commissioner's scope.  A scope includes the ability to
   see that particular data exists and to read the same data.  The scope



Atlas, et al.            Expires March 15, 2013                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            IRS Policy Framework            September 2012


   can have its constraints specified in terms of specific portions of
   data models.

   Similarly, what information a commissioner can install may be
   contrained.  This is known as its influence.  The influence is
   specific in both the parts of the data models and in the set and
   range of data that can be installed.  For example, a commissioner
   might be able to write static routes in the RIB data-model for
   prefixes in 10.0/16.

   While the commissioner's behavior and functionality is specifically
   out-of-scope, it is useful to describe the same scope and influence
   concepts for an agent operating in the context of a commissioner.

   An agent's scope is the set of data that the agent can read or have
   access to.  An agent would generally learn such data because the
   commissioner has sent that data to the agent in an operation.

   An agent's influence is the set and range of data that the agent is
   allowed to provide to the commissioner and that will be accepted by
   the commissioner.  For instance, commissioner B may accept next-hop
   change notifications for prefix 10.0/16 from agent 1 but not from
   agent 2.

3.1.5.  Resources

   When a commissioner sends operations to an agent, those operations
   can consume resources.  Therefore, it is important that the agent
   have policy to limit the resources available to a particular
   commissioner.  This is based on the commissioner's identity and
   security role.  Such resource policy specifications need to be
   provided in a data-model that can be modified by appropriately
   authorized commissioners or local configuration.

   Examples of such resource constraints include:

      Number of installed operations owned,

      Number of operations that haven't reached their start-time, and

      Number of event notifications registered for.

   As discussed in Section 3.1.7, a commissioner can specify priorities
   for the operations it sends.

   If compute resources are considered, it is not the intent to try and
   determine the computation associated with particular operations.
   Instead, the constraint could be on amount of compute-time given to a



Atlas, et al.            Expires March 15, 2013                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            IRS Policy Framework            September 2012


   commissioner every pre-defined period.  This can provide a mechanism
   for fair sharing of compute resources between commissioners.

3.1.6.  Connectivity

   A commissioner does not need to maintain an active communication
   channel with an agent.  Therefore, an agent may need to open a
   communication channel to the commissioner to communicate previously
   requested information.  The lack of an active communication channel
   does not imply that the associated commissioner is non-functional.
   When communication is required, the agent or commissioner can open a
   new communication channel.

   State held by an agent that is owned by a commissioner should not be
   removed or cleaned up when a commissioner is no longer communicating
   - even if the agent cannot successfully open a new communication
   channel to the commissioner.

3.1.7.  Priority

   The motivating example for priority is when a single commissioner is
   sending operations to accomplish multiple tasks.  For example, one
   task might be long-term and another task might deal with unexpected
   requests that are more important.  In this case, the commissioner may
   wish to provide a hint to the relevant agents as to which operations
   should be done first.

   Communication from a commissioner can come across multiple channels,
   so simply specifying that operations be done in order is not
   sufficient.  Additionally, all operations may not be immediately
   carried out, due to varying start-times or other constraints.  With
   these factors and this motivating example, it is useful to introduce
   the concept of prioritization for operations sent from the same
   commissioner.

   By introducing the concept of priority for operations, a commissioner
   can accomplish multiple uncorrelated tasks that affect the same agent
   with the specified prioritization.

   A default priority can be specified for each particular communication
   channel.  In addition, an IRS operation can specify a priority to use
   instead.  Priorities between operations from different commissioners
   need not be compared.

3.1.8.  Precedence

   A mechanism is needed for the agent to determine what state to
   install when there are overlapping install operations.  An install
   operation may overlap with locally-installed configuration state or
   with a previous install operation that was requested by a
   commissioner.  The mechanism to resolve this is termed "precedence".
   No simple mechanism can fully handle indirect interactions;
   considering such interactions is out-of-scope.  Indirect interactions
   must be considered when different commissioners are given their
   tasks.

   A critical aspect of precedence-based decisions is that preference is
   only given based on arrival time of the install operation when
   multiple commissioners use the same precedence value.

   Each install operation has a precedence associated with it.  This
   precedence may come from the default associated with the
   commissioner, with the specific communication channel, or with the
   specific operation.  The range of possible precedence values that can
   be used is known based on the commissioner's security role.  The
   determination of the precedence associated with any operation is a
   policy decision at the agent, but may utilize any or all of the
   information described above.

   When an install operation is executed, the agent first determines if
   there is overlapping existing IRS-installed state.  If not, the agent
   must determine if it overlaps existing local-configuration state.
   Local-configuration state will also have a precedence associated with
   it so that the agent can make an appropriate decision.

   A commissioner can specify whether an install operation should be
   store-if-not-best.  This allows a commissioner to determine what
   happens when an install operation doesn't win the precedence
   comparison.  If store-if-not-best is specified, then the install
   operation succeeds and the associated installed state is stored but
   not actively installed by the agent.  If store-if-not-best is not
   specified, then the install operation will fail.

   The store-if-not-best flag is stored with the installed operation's
   precedence.  If the agent determines that an installed operation must
   be preempted, then the agent consults the store-if-not-best flag.  If
   store-if-not-best is specified, then the agent stores the preempted
   operation and does not notify the associated commissioner.  If store-
   if-not-best is not specified, then the agent notifies the associated
   commisioner of the preemption and removes the previously installed
   state.

   the existing state, then the agent should preempt the existing state
   and act according to the existing state's store-if-not-best flag.  If
   that store-if-not-best flag is set, the agent will store the old
   state and install the new state.  If the store-if-not-best flag is
   clear, the agent will send a preemption notification to the Old IRS
   Comissioner, install the new IRS state, and forget the old.

   If the overlapping existing state has the same precedence and the
   same commissioner associated, then the agent completes the install
   operation; otherwise, the agent must reject or store the install
   operation, based on the store-if-not-best flag.

   If the new overlapping operation has a precedence that is worse than
   the existing state, then the agent must reject or store the install
   operation, based on the state of the new store-if-not-best flag.  If
   the store-if-not-best flag is set, then then the agent will store the
   new IRS state.  If the store-if-not-best flag is clear, then the the
   IRS agent will send a preempt notification to the new commissioner
   and forget the new IRS state.

   This decision process is illustrated in Figure 2.

   When an uninstall operation (e.g. remove) is done, the stored state
   with the next best precedence should be selected and installed.

   A consequence of the precedence policy mechanism is that a
   commissioner must be able to handle its installed operations being
   preempted at any time, either explicitly or simply by having the
   active state changed.  Such preemption can be minimized by
   appropriate separation of tasks, with their associated install
   operations, between the local systems of the commissioners and by
   knowledgeable local system configuration.

3.2.  Policy between Agent and Local System

   It is critical to understand and clearly specify how IRS interacts
   with local configuration.  The key questions are:

   1.  What happens when Local Configuration overlaps with IRS installed
       state?

   2.  What happens when IRS installed state is removed?

   3.  How is state recreated when a local system reboots?

   A consequence of using IRS is that the local system's state may not
   be synchronized with the local configuration.  Since this is a change
   in understood behavior, any discrepencies should be clearly visible

   to the operator with an associated explanation.

   Logically, the local configuration is essentially modeled as a local
   commissioner, with its own precedence, identity, and security role
   and immediate permanent install operations.  The key differences are
   both that all relevant local configuration state need not be cached
   by the agent and that reboot imposes the need to process local
   configuration state before any other IRS-installed state.

3.2.1.  Local Configuration

   The local system's local configuration may have overlapping influence
   with that of one or more commisssioners using an agent.  Therefore,
   explicit and implicit policy interactions must be specified.  The
   mechanism that IRS provides for deciding between overlapping install
   operations is "precedence".  This same mechanism can be used to
   decide between local configuration and an IRS operation.  Local
   configuration can specify the precedence value to be used for the
   local system.

   A precedence value that causes the desired behavior can be specified
   as follows.  (MAX is the highest precedence given to a commissioner.
   MIN is the lowest precedence given to a commissioner.)

      MAX+1 Precedence: If the local configuration has a precedence
      higher than that given to any commissioner, then state from the
      local configuration will always be installed.  If any IRS-
      installed state is therefore preempted, the agent will notify the
      associated commissioner.

      MIN-1 Precedence: If the local configuration has a precedence
      lower than that given to any commissioner, then IRS-installed
      state will always override local configuration.  That this
      preemption has occurred should be reflected in how the local
      system displays its state.

      Other Precedence: The local configuration can have higher
      precedence than that given to some commissioners, lower precedence
      than that given to other commissioners, and equal precedence to
      that given to other commissioners.  Then some local configuration
      state may be preempted by IRS-installed state while some IRS-
      installed state can be preempted by local configuration.

         Local-configuration wins all precedence ties.

   Just as an agent must check to determine if an install operation
   overlaps with existing installed state, the process of committing
   local configuration must check to see if there is overlapping IRS-

Internet-Draft            IRS Policy Framework            September 2012


   installed state.

   What the process of committing local configuration is can vary by
   local system.  Well known examples are when a return is sent to the
   CLI and when an explicit commit command is specified.  How the proper
   checks for interaction between the agent and local configuration are
   done is a local system matter.

   Similarly, when an agent checks to see if an install operation
   overlaps with existing installed state, the agent must determine if
   it overlaps with existing local configuration.

   If the precedence associated with local configuration is changed,
   then it is retroactive.  All local configuration state stored by the
   agent must be updated with the new precedence value and installation
   decisions made for overlapping data.  This change could be very
   disruptive.

3.2.2.  Removal of IRS-installed State

   When a piece of local configuration is removed, the local system goes
   back to the appropriate system default.  However, when an operation
   removes some IRS-installed state is removed, the correct behavior is
   not to just go back to the system default.  Instead, any stored state
   must be considered - whether that comes from local configuration or
   stored IRS install operations that didn't have the highest
   precedence.  If there is any stored state, then the highest
   precedence of the options is selected and installed.  That existing
   overlapping state might come from the local -configuration.

   If IRS's implicit policy were to just go to the system default, then
   the local configuration and the local system state would not be
   synchronized and there would be no remaining IRS-state to explain the
   discrepency.  Since IRS state can also be stored and not installed,
   the same mechanism can be used for stored IRS install operations and
   for local configuration.

3.2.3.  On Reboot

   When the local system reboots, only persistent IRS-installed state is
   preserved by the agent.  The implicit policy for IRS is that the
   local configuration is read and installed first.  After the local
   system has its local configuration installed, the persistent IRS
   install operations are executed to bring the system to the persistent
   state.

4.  Policy in a Sub-Interface

   It is critical to consider how policy influences a sub-interface when
   defining the sub-interface and its associated data-model(s).  There
   are several different aspects to consider.

      How are scope and influence policy specified in the data model?
      What granularity levels are necessary for the particular sub-
      interface?

      How does the implicit policy in the associated routing sub-system
      effect what IRS can be allowed to influence?

      Are the implicit policies of the associated routing sub-system
      captured in the semantic content of the information model, data
      model, and description?

      What explicit policy communicated in the associated routing sub-
      system needs to be included in the data-model?  What indirection
      and abstractions are needed?

4.1.  Resource Reservation and Three-Phase Commit

   Some agents and sub-interfaces may offer the ability to reserve
   resources required by operations before the operation start time.
   There are two aspects to how to support this.

   First, if the agent can do time-aware resource reservation, then an
   install operation can specify "reserve-only" to prompt an
   acknowledgement or failure as to the ability of the agent to confirm
   the reservation.  Then the commissioner can either send an operation
   to commit the reservation, which causes the associated install
   operation, or to remove the reservation.  A "reserve-only" operation
   will have its reservation expire at the end of its associated life-
   time.

   Second, part of a sub-interface's data-model may be to request a
   reservation with a known start-time and duration.  An example might
   be reserving a specific bandwidth on a path for an LSP between two
   devices.  It is important to consider whether a particular sub-
   interface should offer a time-based reservation service as part of
   its data-model.

4.2.  Defining IRS Behavior Based on Implicit and Explicit Policy

   The semantics in a data-model must respect and describe the implicit
   policy of the associated routing sub-system.  This doesn't imply that
   the data-model components should instantiate it or allow reading or



Atlas, et al.            Expires March 15, 2013                [Page 15]

   writing.

   Policy Routing systems must deal with the verification, reading and
   installing of routes from sources such as EGP, IGP, and static
   routes.  Policy routing may also control forwarding and the
   monitoring of data forwarding; and data resources.  The explicit
   policy examples are given for the routing framework.  It is assumed
   the reader can extend this framework to the data forwarding and data
   resource arena.

4.2.1.  Example of Implicit Policy

   The ISIS protocol specification uses implicit policy to set
   constraints on level 1 peers.  Due to this fact, many ISIS
   implementations only let one level 1 ISIS peer associate with one
   Level 2 peer domain.

   This policy is not encoded in any local configuration directly, but
   is rather included as an implicit policy.  When local configuration
   policy is checked (prior to a configuration commit), this local
   policy is checked.  If the configuration input from a CLI is in
   error, the input will be rejected, and the CLI will warn the user.
   Similarily programmic interfaces for the local configuration cause
   the implicit policy to be checked.

   IRS data models guide the commissioner in an interoperable
   interaction with the reading and installation of data at a particular
   agent.  The IRS data models must contain both the implicit policy and
   the explicit policy.  Although an agent may not report the IRS
   implicit policy in the protocol, the commissioner must know of the
   existence of the implicit policy.

   This knowledge allows the commissioner to know the implicit policy
   interactions on different systems in a heterogeneous network.  For
   example, assume a situation where a commissioner is talking to two
   agents - one on system A and one on system B. The routing process on
   system A has has different implicit rules for the ISIS Level 1 peer
   to Level 2 peer connection than the routing process on system B.
   Routing process A is built to allow one level 1 ISIS peer associated
   with 2 ISIS Level 2 peers.  Routing process B upholds the standard
   implicit policy that 1 level ISIS peer can only be associated with 1
   ISIS Level 2 peer.  The commissioner setting up the ISIS peering in a
   network containing system A and system B must know that System A will
   allow a level 1 peer to connect to 2 ISIS Level 2 peers.  When the
   commissioner's scope allows it to read data from system A and system
   B, it should not flag the difference in ISIS level 1 peer connections
   as a problem.  Instead the commissioner will need to determine if the
   use of the different configurations can cause a network problem.

4.2.2.  Passing Explicit Policy

   Routing systems' explicit policy controls protocols, associates/
   deassociates interfaces, route verification policy, route forwarding
   policy, route aggregation policy, and route deaggregation policy.
   All of this policy can be found in the detailed configuration
   specification of a routing process.  However, even via CLI, it is
   rarely possible to configure all the possible options.  Other
   configuration mechanisms do not have public models for all the
   private router configuration.  The developers of a routing system
   often have a complete policy model either in formal modeling
   languages or informal language.

   Explicit policy contained in an IRS data model is the detailed
   configuration model at the deepest level that an gent can access.
   This detailed configuration model may come from IETF Standards and/or
   the vendor specific configurations.  The public data models must
   specify a vendor specific tree where the individual configuration is
   plugged into.

4.2.2.1.  Explicit policy on Data Forwarding, Resources, and Policy
          passing

   Forwarding policy has to do with the data flow may also be controlled
   by an agent.  If so, the explicit policy must be placed in a data
   model along with the implicit policy.

   Lastly, protocols have begun to pass explicit policy about passing
   policy.  Examples of this type of policy are BGP ORFs, BGP Flowspecs,
   and ISIS policy passing.  Commissioners must know the implicit policy
   and explicit policy this policy impacts, and the precedence between
   these policy.  Due to the extensive use of BGP ORFs and the growing
   use in BGP Flowspecs policy, early data models for BGP should
   describe the implicit policy, explicit policy, policy precedence for
   the BGP ORFS and BGP FlowSpecs, and how they interacts with other
   BGP, route policy and preferences.  This information should be placed
   inside an IRS Data Model for an Agent supporting these features.

   These explicit models for BGP policy are not trivial, but these
   models exist today.  Frequently, IRS data models may be simply a
   casting of existing implicit policy and explicit policy into a common
   standard form so that programmic interfaces may interact with a
   routing element.

4.2.2.2.  Example of Explicit Policy

   There are two clear explicit policy pieces for ISIS.  First is the
   peer level.  Second is the policy of the external routes to be
