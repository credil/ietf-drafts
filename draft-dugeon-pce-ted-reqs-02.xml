    <keyword>Draft</keyword>

    <abstract>
      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) working group (WG) has produced a
      set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path Computation Element
      as a tool to help MPLS-TE and GMPLS LSP tunnels placement. In the PCE
      architecture, a main assumption has been done concerning the information
      that the PCE needs to perform its computation. In a fist approach, the
      PCE embeds a Traffic Engineering Database (TED) containing all pertinent
      and suitable information regarding the network that is in the scope of a
      PCE. Nevertheless, the TED requirements as well as the TED information
      have not yet been formalized. In addition, some recent RFC (like the
      Backward Recursive Path Computation procedure or PCE Hierarchy) or WG
      draft (like draft-ietf-pce-stateful-pce ...) suffer from a lack of
      information in the TED, leading to a non optimal result or to some
      difficulties to deploy them. This memo tries to identify some Database,
      at large, requirements for the PCE. It is split in two main sections:
      the identification of the specific information to be stored in the PCE
      Database and how it may be populated.</t>

    <section title="Problem Statement">
      <t>Looking to the different RFCs that describe the PCE architecture and
      in particular <xref target="RFC4655">RFC 4655</xref>, <xref
      target="RFC5440">RFC 5440</xref>, <xref target="RFC5441"> RFC
      5441</xref> and <xref target="RFC6805">RFC 6805</xref>, the Path
      Computation Element (PCE) needs to acquire a set of information that is
      usually store in the Traffic Engineering Database (TED) in order to
      perform its path computation. Even if intra-domain topology acquisition
      is well documented and known (e.g. by listening to the IGP-TE protocol
      that runs inside the network), inter-domain topology information, PCE
      peer address, neighbor AS, existing MPLS-TE tunnels... that are
      necessary for the Global Concurrent Optimization, Backward Recursive
      Path Computation (BRPC) and the Hierarchical PCE are not documented and
      not completely standardized.</t>

      <t>The purpose of this memo is to inventory the required information
      that should be part of the PCE Database and the different mechanisms
      that allow an operator to populate it.</t>

      <section title="PCE Assumption and Hypothesis">
        <t>In some cases, both the path computation and the Database
        operations are slightly coupled: border node identification, endpoint
        localization, TE-LSP learning and domain sequence selection... to name
        a few in which an IGP-based TED may not be sufficient. It is also
        important to differentiate several environments with different
        requirements, especially for the multi-domain problem. The PCE is
        scoped for any kind of network, from transmission networks (TDM/WDM)
        with a rather limited number of domains, few interconnections, and few
        confidentiality issues; transmission networks with a large number of
        domains; MPLS networks with several administrative domains; and big
        IP/MPLS networks with a large number of domains with peering
        agreements. For each of them, a different solution for the
        multi-domain path computation may apply. A solution may not be
        scalable for one, but perfectly suitable for another.</t>

        <t>Up to now, PCE WG has based its work and standard on the assumption
        and hypothesis that the TED contains all pertinent information
        suitable for the PCE to compute an optimal TE-LSP placement, over one
        or several domains a PCE has visibility on or over a set of
        PCE-capable domains (e.g. using BRPC procedure). We could identify two
        major sources of information for the TED:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The intra-domain routing protocol like OSPF-TE or IS-IS-TE
            (including extensions for border links),</t>

            <t>The inter-domain routing protocol, i.e. BGP for the inter-AS
            case.</t>
          </list>If the first source gives a precise and synchronize view of
        the controlled network, BGP typically just provides network
        reachability with only one AS path (unless using recent add path
        option). Nevertheless, to optimize inter-domain path computation,
        route diversity and a minimum set of Traffic Engineering information
        about the foreign domains could be helpful. Despite that it is
        possible to re-announce TE-LSP in the IGP-TE, the PCE needs also to
        have a precise knowledge of previous TE-LSP, not only for its stateful
        version [<xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce">PCEP Extensions for
        Stateful PCE]</xref>, but also when performing a global concurrent
        optimization <xref target="RFC5557">RFC5557</xref> of the previous
        TE-LSPs place on a given domain.</t>

        <t>Another source of information, mainly static information can be the
        management plane, e.g. using SNMP, CLI... So, it is necessary to
        classify the source of information by their frequency of update:
        static or dynamic, e.g. a domain ID is unlikely to change, while
        unreserved bandwidth of a link may be continuously changing.</t>

        <t>In this document, PCE Database (PCED) is used not only to refer to
        the standard Traffic Engineering Database information, but is extended
        to all pertinent information e.g. it also contains previous TE-LSPs
        establish in the domain and sometimes referred as LSP DB in other
        documents.</t>

        <t>For Stateful operation and Global Concurrent Optimization, the PCED
        should also contain information on TE-LSPs already enforce in the

        IGP-TE, the PCE could not learn from the IGP-TE all details of all TE
        LSPs: if TE information is known, detail of the ERO is lost as well as
        initial QoS parameters. The following information will be useful for

        <t>Contrary to intra-domain where the PCE known the exact details of

        mostly for confidentiality of the networks. This memo propose a basic
        schema that allows PCE to known sufficient details about the foreign
        domain while keeping confidential the internal information. For this
        purpose, we propose to describe a domain as a "Grey-Box" with inputs
        and outputs that correspond to the Border Nodes (BNs). Then Grey-Boxes
        are interconnected through inter-domain links between the BNs. Then,
        suitable performance indicators are given to cross the Grey-Boxes from
        an input BN to and output BN. Figure below gives as example of such
        model.</t>

        <t>With such inter-domain information, a PCE could look into the
        different inter-domain path (as the sum of inter-domain links and
        Grey-Box crossing performances) and select the most suitable one
        regarding the PCReq.</t>

        <t>If the inter-domain links between BN that connect the Grey-Boxes

    <section title="PCED Population">
      <t>This section aims to provide best current practices when mechanisms
      are well-known and some hints when standard solutions exist to populate
      the PCE TED, and so give directions to extend them. In particular, we
      aim at providing input on whether the TED gets the information from the
      routing protocol and how it gets it, which specific routing protocols
      are suited, whether it gets it from an NMS, at what frequency the TED is
      updated... and if it needs extra information.</t>

      <section title="Intra-domain">
        <t/>

        <section title="MPLS">
          <t>As the TED mainly contains the intra-domain topology graph, it is
          RECOMMENDED to link the PCE with the underlying IGP-TE (OSPF-TE or
          IS-IS-TE routing protocol). By adding the PCE into the IGP-TE
          routing intra-domain, it is possible to listen to the routing
          protocol and then acquired the complete topology graph as well as
          let the PCE announce itself (see RFC5088 and RFC5089). In addition,
          the TED will synchronize as fast as the routing protocol converges
          like any router in the domain. Best current practices are also of
          interest when a PCE compute path that spawn to several area /
          region. In that case, the PCE must be aware of the topology details
          of each area / region and not only the backbone area / region 1 with
          the summary of stub area / region 2.</t>

          <t>In addition, management tools may be used to complement the
          topology graph provided by the routing protocol.</t>

      <section title="Inter-Domain">
        <t>If for inter-area aspect of the inter-domain, actual IGP-TE
        protocol provide the aforementioned information without any particular
        extension, this is not the case for the inter-as scenario.</t>

        <t>First of all, RFC 5316 or RFC 5392 MUST be activated in the IGP-TE
        (respectively in IS-IS-TE or OSPF-TE) in order to advertise TE
        information on the inter-domain links. This give the advantage for the
        PCE to determine what could be feasible, during path computation, on
        the peering links.</t>

        <t>In MPLS, AS path and network reachability are obtained from BGP and
        routing tables. However, it is not straightforward to collect route
        diversity or TE information (i.e. bandwidth, transit delay, packet
        loss ratio, jitter ...) on a foreign domain. Right now, we have
        identified several methods, which have been tested to fill in the PCED

            <t>A hierarchical TE that could help to advertise, at the AS
            level, TE information on an abstract/aggregate view of the foreign
            AS topology;</t>

            <t>A PCEP extension to convey such TE information to the foreign
            PCE.</t>
          </list></t>

        <section title="Information exchange">
          <t>The force of PCE is to be aware of the complete topology of the
          underlying network. With such knowledge, it could place efficiently
          the tunnel even if it not follows the route computed by the routing
          protocol. Same principles apply also for the inter-domain. But, in
          the Internet today, BGP summarize the route and the PCE should not
          be aware of the route diversity. In particular, it could not choose
          another AS path as the one selected and announced by BGP. In such
          case, the PCE will not be sufficiently aware of the route diversity
          and could not selected the optimal AS path when computing an
          inter-domain LSP. To avoid this and allows PCE known route diversity
          to reach a given foreign domain, the inter-domain information must
          be propagated between all PCEs without aggregation or summarization.
          In summary, PCEs need to synchronize part of their Database i.e. the
          inter-domain ones. Disregarding the protocol, two different
          solutions emerged to exchange inter-domain information:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>Direct Distribution: Exchange TE information using BGP is
              part of this case. In this scenario, it is necessary to
              establish a BGP session between the different domains (whatever
              the platform used, a dedicated router, a PCE, another server
              ...). In the hierarchal PCE scenario, operators that provide
              child PCE, agree to establish a relation with foreign domain
              that provides the parent PCE. But, in BRPC, or in Hierarchical
              PCE where almost operators provide a parent PCE, BGP session
              must be establish between networks that have not necessary
              direct adjacency. However, operators should not agree to accept
              relation from other's not directly attached to their network. In
              addition, this scenario could conduct to establish a full mesh
              of BGP session between PCE which could lead into some
              scalability problems.</t>

              <t>Flooding Distribution: In this case, the inter-domain
              information are flood between all PCE so that each PCE is aware
              about all foreign domain capabilities. This meets the
              requirement but doesn't provide the flexibility of BGP in term
              of filtering. Indeed, BGP allows through configuration to decide
              which information are announced and to whom. As a per session
              relation, a given operator is not oblige to announce the same
              capabilities to its foreign domain. With flooding distribution,
              where everybody redistribute what it has learned without modify
              it, it is not possible to specialize announcement based on
              foreign domain.</t>
            </list>So, the solution must provide the possibility to filter
          what is announce per foreign domain without authorized the
          summarization or aggregation while keeping a distributed relation
          between domains. In addition, a domain is responsible about the
          Grey-Box announcement and the advertisement information must not be
          modified by intermediate PCE.</t>

      <section title="TE-LSPs">
        <t>Up to know, the PCE could learn the tunnel already enforce in the
        controlled domain through dedicated NMS system. Recent works on state
        full extensions for PCEP propose to add new messages in order to
        collect information on TE-LSPs from the PCCs.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operational information">
        <t>Most of the time operational information are provided through the
        management system of the operator, but some could be automatically
        discovered. In particular, in intra-domain, PCCs and PCEs can discover
        automatically reachable PCEs (as well as computation domains) through
        the deployment of <xref target="RFC5088">RFC 5088</xref>, for
        OSPF-controlled networks, and <xref target="RFC5089">RFC 5089</xref>
        for IS-IS controlled networks. However, for the inter-PCE discovery at
        the inter-AS level, no mechanism has been standardized (unless ASes
        are owned by the same ISP).</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Acquisition of information for the PCE TED is of course sensible from
      a security point of view, especially when acquiring information from
      others AS. This section aims at providing best practices to prevent some
      security threat when the PCE try to acquire TED information.</t>

      <section title="Intra-domain information">
        <t>Same security considerations must be applied to the PCE when it is
        connected to an IGP-TE protocol as the routing protocol itself. Best
        practices observed and deployed by operators must also be taken into
        account when installing some PCEs. Indeed, even when deployed as a
        standalone server, PCEs must be considered as a typical router from
        the IGP-TE perspective. As a result, beyond OSPF or IS-IS themselves,
        the usual security rules must be applied, e.g. login/passwd,
        authentication/digest... to protect the connectivity.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Inter-domain information">
        <t>Inter-domain relation and so information exchange are subject to
        high potential hijack and so need attention from the security point of
        view. To avoid disclosing or expose confidential information that two
        operators would exchange to fill in the TEDs of their respective PCEs,
        the relation SHOULD be protected by standard cryptography mechanism.
        E.g. using IPsec tunnel is RECOMMENDED to protect the connectivity
        between PCEs and the TED exchanges.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operational information">
        <t>All operational information like PCE peer addresses are generally
        added manually to the TED and so do not need any particular protection
        nor subject to security. But, as this basic information is needed to
        connected the PCEs to their peers, it could potentially be associated
        to sensitive parameters like login and password. So, standard Best
        Practices are RECOMMENDED to avoid basic security exposition.</t>
