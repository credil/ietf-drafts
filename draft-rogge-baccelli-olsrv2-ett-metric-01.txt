Internet-Draft         Directional ETT for OLSRv2              June 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Funkfeuer [FUNKFEUER] and Freifunk networks [FREIFUNK] are OLSR-
   based [RFC3626] wireless community networks with hundreds of routers
   in permanent operation.  The Vienna Funkfeuer network in Austria, for
   instance, consists of 400 routers (around 600 routes) covering the
   whole city of Vienna and beyond, spanning roughly 40km in diameter.
   It has been in operation since 2003 and supplies its users with
   Internet access.  The particularity of the Vienna Funkfeuer network
   is that it manages to provide Internet access through a city wide,
   large scale Wi-Fi mesh cloud, with just a single uplink.

   Operational experience with such a network has revealed that the use
   of hop-count as routing metric leads to unsatisfactory network
   performance.  Experiments with the ETX metric [MOBICOM03] were
   therefore undertaken in parallel in the Berlin Freifunk network as
   well as in the Vienna Funkfeuer network, and found satisfactory, i.e.
   sufficiently easy to implement and providing sufficiently good
   performance.  This metric has now been in operational use in these
   networks for more than 2 years.

   This ETX metric of a link is the estimated number of transmissions
   required to successfully send a packet (each packet smaller than MTU)
   over that link, until an acknowledgement is received.  The ETX metric
   is additive, i.e. the ETX metric of a path is the sum of the ETX
   metrics for each link on this path.

   While the ETX metric delivers a reasonable performance, it doesn't
   handle networks with heterogeneous links that have different link
   speed well.  Every link is only measured by its packet loss, the
   metric prefers long and slow links over short and fast links, which
   can degrade the performance of a network considerably.

   Based on the ETX metric this document describes an Estimated Travel
   Time (ETT) metric [MOBICOM04] for the usage with the Optimized Link
   State Routing Protocol Version 2, which also takes the link-speed
   into account.  More precisely, this document specifies the processing
   for NHDP [RFC6130] in order to establish the ETT metric value for a
   link.


2.  Terminology

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL
   NOT','SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'NOT RECOMMENDED', 'MAY',
   and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in[RFC2119].

Internet-Draft         Directional ETT for OLSRv2              June 2013


   The terminology introduced in [RFC5444], [OLSRV2] and [RFC6130],
   including the terms "packet", "message", "Address Block", "TLV
   Block","TLV", "address", "address prefix", and "address object" are
   to be interpreted as described therein.

   Additionally, this document uses the following terminology and
   notational conventions:

   QUEUE  - a first in, first out queue of integers.

   QUEUE[0]  - the most recent entry added to the queue.

   push(QUEUE, value)  - an operation which removes the oldest entry in
      the queue and places a new entry at the head of the queue.

   sum(QUEUE)  - an operation which returns the sum of all elements in a
      QUEUE.

   diff_seqno(new, old)  - an operation which returns the positive
      distance between two elements of the circular sequence number
      space defined in Section 5.1 of [RFC5444].  Its value is either
      (new - old) if this result is positive, or else its value is (new
      - old + 65536).

   UNDEFINED  - a constant for -1.

   ETX  - Expected Transmission Count, a link metric proportional to the
      number of transmissions to sucessfully send an IP packet over a
      link.

   ETT  - Estimated Travel Time, a link metric proportional to the
      amount of airtime needed to transmit an IP packet over a link, not
      considering layer-2 overhead created by preamble, backoff time and
      queuing.


3.  Applicability Statement

   The mechanism specified in this document is based on the ETX metric
   used daily by hundreds of routers in the Funkfeuer network
   [FUNKFEUER], as well as in similar OLSR-based wireless community
   networks which use the OLSR.org [OLSR.org] code base, such as
   [FREIFUNK], [AWMN], [NINUX], [GUIFI] and [OPENAIR].  Operational
   experience suggests that this mechanism is viable in (at least) these
   kinds of networks.

   The ETT metric of the new OLSRv2 implementation of Olsr.org is a
   refinement of the ETX metric, providing a directional metric that

Internet-Draft         Directional ETT for OLSRv2              June 2013


   takes into account the speed of the link to compute the link cost.

   The ETX metric value of a link is established by measuring the rate
   of successful exchange of OLSRv2 control packets over that link,
   which use the format defined in [RFC5444].  ETX metric computation is
   thus based only on layer 3 signaling, and is therefore independent
   from underlying link layer technologies.  Moreover, ETX metric
   computation does not require inspection of data traffic.

   The ETT metric value can only be computed if the incoming link speed
   to each one-hop neighbor is known to the routing daemon, either by
   measurement or from a configuration file.


4.  Directional Packet-Size Agnostic ETT

   The metric specified in this document is based on the Estimated
   Travel Time (ETT) metric published in [MOBICOM04].

   The paper describes the metric as 'ETX divided by link-speed', but
   introduce a 'packet size' variable in the formula representation,
   describing the metric as 'ETX times packet-size divided by link-
   speed'.

   This document specifies the use of a variant of the ETT metric
   without any packet-size variable integrated into the link costs.
   There are two reasons for this decision:

   o  The original ETT metric was designed for a DSR derived source-
      routed protocol.  Typical linkstate protocols like OSLRv2 do not
      process each data-plane packet on its own, which makes it
      difficult to integrate the size of the data-plane packets into the
      routing metric.

   o  The original ETT metric assumes that the airtime spend on a link
      is proportional to the size of the packet transmitted over the
      link.

   o  Multiplying all topology edge costs 'ETX divided by link-speed'
      with the size of a packet would not change the result of the
      shortest path calculation, independently of the packet size.  This
      means both description of ETT should result in the same next-hop
      decision.

   In addition to this, the metric described in this document is
   directional, it does calculate the ETX value only based on the packet
   loss at the receiver.

5.  Metric Functioning & Overview

   Router A computes the ETX value of its link with router B by
   continuously estimating the loss rates for incoming traffic over this
   link.  The ETT metric is calculated as the ETX metric, divided by a
   normalized link speed of the incoming unicast traffic and use this
   value as L_in_metric of the Link Set (as defined in section 8.1. of
   [OLSRV2]).


6.  Data Structures

   This specification extends the Link Set per Interface Information
   Base, as defined in [RFC6130], with the following additional elements
   for each link tuple:

      L_METRIC_received is a queue with ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH integer
      elements.  Each entry contains the number of successfully received
      [RFC5444] packets within an interval of ETT_REFRESH_INTERVAL.

      L_METRIC_total is a queue with ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH integer elements.
      Each entry contains the estimated number of [RFC5444] packets
      transmitted by the neighbor, based on the received packet sequence
      numbers within an interval of ETT_REFRESH_INTERVAL.

      L_METRIC_last_pkt_seqno is the last received packet sequence
      number received from this link.

      L_METRIC_hello_time is the time when the next hello will be
      expected.  This is used to detect missing hellos by timeout
      [RFC5497].

      L_METRIC_hello_interval is the interval between two hello messages
      of the links neighbor as signaled by the INTERVAL_TIME TLV of NHDP
      messages.

      L_METRIC_lost_hello_messages is the estimated number of lost hello
      messages from this neighbor, based on the value of the hello
      interval.

      L_METRIC_rx_bitrate is the current link speed of incoming unicast
      traffic for this neighbor.

   Methods to obtain the value of L_METRIC_rx_bitrate are out of scope
   for this specification.  Such methods may be static autoconfiguration
   via a configuration file, or dynamic measurement through mechanisms
   described in a separate specification.  Any Link tuple with L_status
   = HEARD or L_status = SYMMETRIC MUST have a specified value of

Internet-Draft         Directional ETT for OLSRv2              June 2013


   L_METRIC_rx_bitrate if it is to be used by this routing metric.


7.  Initial Values

   When generating a new tuple in the Link Set, the values of the
   elements specified above are set as follows:

      L_METRIC_received := 0, ..., 0.  The queue always have
      ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH elements.

      L_METRIC_total := 0, ..., 0.  The queue always have
      ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH elements.

      L_METRIC_last_pkt_seqno := UNDEFINED.

      L_METRIC_hello_time := EXPIRED.

      L_METRIC_hello_interval := UNDEFINED.

      L_METRIC_lost_hello_messages := 0


8.  Protocol Parameters

   This specification uses the parameters defined in [OLSRV2].  This
   specification defines the following additional parameters:

   ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH  - ETT algorithm queue length.  All received and
      lost packets within the queue are used to calculate the ETT cost
      of the link.

   ETT_REFRESH_INTERVAL  - interval in seconds between two metric
      recalculations as described in Section 11.

   ETT_SEQNO_RESTART_DETECTION  - threshold in number of missing packets
      (based on received packet sequence numbers) at which point the
      router considers the neighbor has restarted.

   ETT_HELLO_TIMEOUT_FACTOR  - timeout factor for HELLO interval at
      which point a HELLO is definitely considered lost.  The value must
      be a floating point number larger than 1.0.

   ETT_WORST_ETX  - Maximum ETX value used in this routing metric.

Internet-Draft         Directional ETT for OLSRv2              June 2013


   ETT_BEST_LINKSPEED  - Maximum link speed in bits/s of used in routing
      metric.

   ETT_WORST_LINKSPEED  - Minimum link speed in bits/s used in this
      metric.

   ETT_WORST_NO_LOSS_METRIC_VALUE  - metric value for ETX 1.0 and
      ETT_WORST_LINKSPEED link speed.


9.  Packets and Messages

   Generated packets and messages use the format defined in [RFC5444].
   The present specification adds the following constraints:

   o  A packet MUST contain a packet sequence number as defined in
      [RFC5444].  This sequence number MUST be interface specific and
      must be incremented by 1 for each packet.

   o  [RFC6130] Hello messages MUST contain the INTERVAL_TIME TLV.

9.1.  Packet Processing

   Each incoming packet is processed as defined in OLSRv2 [OLSRV2].
   Furthermore, the following additional processing MUST be carried out
   after the packet has been processed on the link set tuple
   corresponding to the source of the packet:

   1.  If L_METRIC_last_pkt_seqno = UNDEFINED, then:

       1.  L_METRIC_received[0] := 1.

       2.  L_METRIC_total[0] := 1.

   2.  Otherwise:

       1.  L_METRIC_received[0] := L_METRIC_received[0] + 1.

       2.  diff := seq_diff(seqno, L_METRIC_last_pkt_seqno).

       3.  If diff > ETT_SEQNO_RESTART_DETECTION, then:

           1.  diff := 1.

       4.  L_METRIC_total[0] := L_METRIC_total[0] + diff.

Internet-Draft         Directional ETT for OLSRv2              June 2013


   3.  L_METRIC_last_pkt_seqno := seqno.


10.  HELLO Timeout

   When L_METRIC_hello_time has timed out, the following step MUST be
   done:

   1.  L_METRIC_lost_hellos := L_METRIC_lost_hellos + 1.

   2.  L_METRIC_hello_time := L_METRIC_hello_time +
       L_METRIC_hello_interval.


11.  Periodic Metric Computation

   This metric stores the number of received packets per link from a
   neighbor and use the packet sequence number to calculate the total
   number of sent packets from the neighbor.  The total number of
   packets divided by the number of received packets is used as an ETX
   value for the link.

   If connectivity of link with a node is lost, no packets are received
   anymore and neither the received nor total value of packets will
   change.  To prevent a constant result in this case, the metric stores
   the number of HELLO message interval timeouts since the last received
   packet from a neighbor and uses this value to reduce the received
   packet count proportionally to the length of the metric memory
   ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH.

   Once every ETT_REFRESH_INTERVAL, this protocol MUST recalculate all
   L_in_metric values in all Link Set entries:

   1.  sum_received := sum(L_METRIC_total).

   2.  sum_total := sum(L_METRIC_received).

   3.  If L_METRIC_hello_interval != UNDEFINED and L_METRIC_lost_hellos
       > 0, then:

       1.  penalty := L_METRIC_hello_interval * L_METRIC_lost_hellos /
           ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH.

       2.  sum_received := sum_received * ( 1 - penalty );

   4.  If sum_received < 1, then:

Internet-Draft         Directional ETT for OLSRv2              June 2013


       1.  L_METRIC_r_etx := UNDEFINED.

       2.  L_in_metric := MAXIMUM_METRIC.

   5.  Otherwise:

       1.  etx := sum_total / sum_received.

       2.  If etx > ETT_WORST_ETX, then:

           1.  etx := ETT_WORST_ETX.

       3.  speed := L_METRIC_rx_bitrate.

       4.  If speed > ETT_BEST_LINKSPEED, then:

           1.  speed := ETT_BEST_LINKSPEED.

       5.  If speed < ETT_WORST_LINKSPEED, then:

           1.  speed := ETT_WORST_LINKSPEED.

       6.  L_in_metric := ETT_WORST_NO_LOSS_METRIC_VALUE * etx / (speed
           / ETT_WORST_LINKSPEED).

   6.  push(L_METRIC_total, 0)

   7.  push(L_METRIC_received, 0)


12.  Proposed Values for Parameters and Constants

   This section proposes values for various parameters used in this
   specification.

   o  ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH := 64 seconds

   o  ETT_REFRESH_INTERVAL := 1 second

   o  ETT_SEQNO_RESTART_DETECTION := 256

   o  ETT_HELLO_TIMEOUT_FACTOR := 1.5

   o  ETT_WORST_ETX := 16

   o  ETT_BEST_LINKSPEED := 256 MBit/s

Internet-Draft         Directional ETT for OLSRv2              June 2013


   o  ETT_WORST_LINKSPEED := 1 MBit/s

   o  ETT_WORST_NO_LOSS_METRIC_VALUE := 4096

   With this values this ETT metric will go from 16 (256+ MBit/s, ETX
   1.0) over 4096 (1 MBit/s, ETX 1.0) to a maximum of 65536 (1 MBit/s,
   ETX 16.0).


13.  Security Considerations

   Artificial manipulation of metrics values can drastically alter
   network performance.  In particular, advertising a higher L_in_metric
   value may decrease the amount of incoming traffic, while advertising
   lower L_in_metric may increase the amount of incoming traffic.  By
   artificially increasing or decreasing the L_in_metric values it
   advertises, a rogue router may thus attract or repulse data traffic.
   A rogue router may then potentially degrade data throughput by not
   forwarding data as it should or redirecting traffic into routing
   loops or bad links.
