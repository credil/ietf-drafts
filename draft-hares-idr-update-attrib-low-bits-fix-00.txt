Internet-Draft           Low Bits Clarification             January 2013


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4271] specifies in section 4.3 that that the low order four bits
   of the the Attribute Flags octet are unused, and MUST be zero when
   sent.  There is a disagreement on what when sent means.  This draft
   clarifies the meaning.

   The issue has been that one school of thought considers that "when
   sent" means when originated.  Another holds that "when sent" means
   when originated or propagated.  The real issue is that reserved flags
   are only useful if there is some hope of someday using them for
   something.  If implementations reset these flags on propagation, then
   a future revision to the BGP specification which introduces a new
   flag will not be able to propagate the new attribute flag end to end,
   since it would be very likely that some well-meaning intermediate
   router would zero on it.  The effort to roll out implementations that
   transited the new flag would almost certainly be prohibitive.

            Original Text:

            The lower-order four bits of the Attribute Flags octet are
            unused.  They MUST be zero when sent and MUST be ignored when
            received

            Corrected Text:

            The lower-order four bits of the Attribute Flags octet are
            unused.  They MUST be zero when originated.  When received, any
            value MUST be accepted.  When a BGP speaker propagates an
            attribute, it MUST propagate these flags as received.

3.  Known BGP Implementation Habits

   The following are BGP implementation habits regarding the unused flag
   bits

   o  always ignore bits received, and always send zero (originated or
      propagated);

   o  always ignore bits received, always send zero bits (originated),
      and propagate what was received;

   o  if non-zero bits are received, drop the peering session;

   o  by special condition (policy) handle set bits or set bits, and
      propagate;and

   o  always sets bits under special conditions, and propagates bits.

   The reset of BGP sessions based on non-zero bits has been documented
   at:

   http://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2012-November/053754.html

   Compliance with this draft, as well as [RFC4271], means that routers
   should not reset BGP sessions if if non-zero lower bits are received.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document has no new security cases.

   It clarifies some BGP UPDATE packet flag values and thus may aid in
   improving BGP security.  In particular, it makes it even clearer that
   routers must not reset a session upon receiving unexpected flag
   values.  Behaving otherwise exposes a router to a denial-of-service
   attack since a distant party might be able to inject such flag
   values.
