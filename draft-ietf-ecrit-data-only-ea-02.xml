      <t>The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) <xref target="cap"/> is an XML document format for
        exchanging emergency alerts and public warnings. CAP is mainly used for conveying alerts and
        warnings between authorities and from authorities to citizen/individuals. This document
        describes how data-only emergency calls are able to utilize the same CAP document format.</t>
      <t>Emergency alerts containing data are similar to regular emergency calls in
        the sense that they require emergency call routing functionality and
        may even have the same location requirements.  On the other hand, the
        communication interaction may occur without establishment
        of a voice or video channel.</t>
      <t>Data-only emergency alerts are similar to regular emergency calls in the sense that they
        require emergency call routing functionality and may even have the same location requirements. 
        On the other hand, the initial communication interaction will not lead
        to the establishment of a voice or video channel.</t>

        <t>
          Based on the deployment experience with non-IP based systems, two
   major deployment scenarios are envisaged:
</t>
<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Emergency alerts containing only data are targeted to a 
      recipient responsible for evaluating the next steps, which
      could include:
     <list style="numbers"> 
         <t>Sending an alert containing only data toward a Public
            Safety Answering Point (PSAP);
         </t>
         <t>Establishing an emergency call with a PSAP that could
            include audio/video as well as data
         </t>
    </list>
  </t>
  <t>Emergency alerts targeted to a Service URN used for IP-based 
       emergency calls where the recipient is not known to 
       the originator.  In this scenario, the alert may contain
       only data (e.g. a CAP and a PIDF-LO payload in a SIP MESSAGE) 
       or could be included along with
       establishment of an audio/video channel (e.g. SIP INVITE)
  </t>
  </list> 
</t>
<t>We describe these two cases in more detail in <xref target="arch"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="arch" title="Architectural Overview">
      <t>This section illustrates two envisioned usage modes; targeted and location-based emergency 
      alert routing. <xref target="targeted"/> shows a deployment variant where a sensor, 
      as the author and originator of the alert, is pre-configured (using techniques outside the 
      scope of this document) to issue an alert to a receiver or an aggregator, a special form of mediator, 
      that processes these messages and performs whatever steps are necessary to appropriately 
      react on the alert. For example, a security firm may use different sensor inputs to 
      dispatch their security staff to a building they protect or to initiate a third party emergency call.</t>

      <t>
        In <xref target="location"/> a scenario is shown whereby the alert is routed 
        using location information and the Service URN. An emergency services routing 
        proxy (ESRP) may use LoST to determine the next hop proxy to route the alert 
        message to. A possible receiver is a PSAP and the recipient of the alert 
        may be call taker. In the generic case, there is very likely no prior relationship between 
        the originator and the receiver, e.g. PSAP. A PSAP, for example, is likely to receive and 
        accept alerts from entities it cannot authorize. This scenario corresponds more to the 
        classical emergency services use case and the description in 
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"/> is applicable.

        <t>Since alerts structured via CAP require a "push" medium. The following SIP requests 
        MAY carry the CAP payload defined in this document: INVITE <xref target="RFC3261"/>, UPDATE <xref target="RFC3311"/>,
MESSAGE <xref target="RFC3428"/>, INFO <xref target="RFC6086"/>, NOTIFY <xref target="RFC3265"/>, and PUBLISH <xref target="RFC3903"/>. 
        
         The MIME type is set to 'application/cap+xml'.</t>
        <t>If the server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the
   request then a 501 Not Implemented MUST be returned by RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/>. This is the appropriate response when a UAS does not
   recognize the request method and is not capable of supporting it for
   any user.</t>
   
        <t>The 415 Unsupported Media Type error MUST be returned by RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/> 
        if the server is refusing to service the request because the message
   body of the request is in a format not supported by the server for

   <t>HCOLON, SEMI, and EQUAL are defined in RFC3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/>. DIGIT is
   defined in RFC5234 <xref target="RFC5234"/>.</t>

   <t>The AlertMsg-Error header field MUST contain only one
   ErrorValue to indicate what was wrong with the alert payload
   the recipient determined was bad.</t>
   
   <t>
   The ErrorValue
   contains a 3-digit error code indicating what was wrong with the
   alert in the request.  This error code has a corresponding quoted
   error text string that is human understandable.  The text string are
   OPTIONAL, but RECOMMENDED for human readability, similar to the
   string phrase used for SIP response codes. That said, the strings
   are complete enough for rendering to the user, if so desired. The
   strings in this document are recommendations, and are not
   standardized - meaning an operator can change the strings - but MUST
   NOT change the meaning of the error code. Similar to how RFC 3261
   specifies, there MUST NOT be more than one string per error code.
   </t>
   <t>
   The AlertMsg-Error header field MAY be included in any response
    as an alert message was in the request part of the same transaction.  
    For
   example, a UA includes an alert in an MESSAGE to a PSAP. The PSAP can
   accept this MESSAGE, thus creating a dialog, even though his UA
   determined the alert message contained in the MESSAGE was bad. 
   The PSAP merely
   includes a AlertMsg-Error header value in the 200 OK to the
   MESSAGE informing the UA that the MESSAGE was accepted but the alert
   provided was bad.</t>

   <t>If, on the other hand, the PSAP cannot accept the MESSAGE without a
   suitable alert message, a 425 response is sent.</t>

   <t>A SIP intermediary that requires the UA's alert message in order to
   properly process the MESSAGE may also sends a 425 with a
   AlertMsg-Error code.</t>

   <t>This document defines an initial list of error code ranges for any
   SIP response, including provisional responses (other than 100
   Trying) and the new 425 response. There MUST be no more than
   one AlertMsg-Error code in a SIP response.</t>

<t>AlertMsg-Error: 100 ; code="Cannot Process the Alert Payload"</t>

<t>AlertMsg-Error: 101 ; code="Alert Payload was not present or could not be found"</t>

<t>AlertMsg-Error: 102 ; code="Not enough information to determine
        the purpose of the alert"</t>

<t>AlertMsg-Error: 103 ; code="Alert Payload was corrupted"</t>

<t>Additionally, if an LR cannot or chooses not to process the alert message
   from a SIP request, a 500 (Server Internal Error) SHOULD be used
   with or without a configurable Retry-After header field.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-cons" title="Security Considerations">
      <t> This section discusses security considerations when SIP user agents issue emergency
        alerts utilizing CAP. Location specific threats are not unique to this document and are 
        discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-trustworthy-location"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-sipcore-location-conveyance"/>.</t>
        
        <t>The ECRIT emergency services architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"/> considers classical individual-to-authority emergency calling and the identity of the emergency caller does not play a role at the time of the call establishment itself, i.e., a response to the emergency call will not depend on the identity of the caller. In case of emergency alerts generated by devices, like sensors, the processing may be different in order to reduce the number of falsely generated emergency alerts. Alerts may get triggered based on certain sensor input that may have been caused by other factors than the actual occurrence of an alert relevant event. For example, a sensor may simply be malfunctioning. For this purpose not all alert messages are directly sent to a PSAP but are rather pre-processed by a separate entity, potentially under supervision by a human, to filter alerts and potentially correlate received alerts with others to obtain a larger picture of the ongoing situation. These two message routing examples are shown in <xref target="targeted"/> and in <xref target="location"/>.</t>
        
<t>In any case, for alerts that are initiated by sensors the identity may play an important role in deciding whether to accept or ignore an incoming alert message. With the scenario shown in <xref target="targeted"/> it is very likely that only authorized sensor input will be processed. For this purpose it needs to be ensured that no alert messages from an unknown origin are accepted. Two types of information elements can be used for this purpose: 
<list style="numbers"> 
<t>SIP itself provides security mechanisms that allow the verification of the originator's identity. These mechanisms can be re-used, such as P-Asserted-Identity <xref target="RFC3325"/> or SIP Identity <xref target="RFC4474"/>. The latter provides a cryptographic assurance while the former relies on a chain of trust model.</t> 
<t>CAP provides additional security mechanisms and the ability to carry additional information about the sender's identity. Section 3.3.2.1 of <xref target="cap"/> specifies the signing algorithms of CAP
              documents.</t>
</list> 
</t>
<t>In addition to the desire to perform identity-based access control the classical communication security threats need to be considered, including integrity protection to prevent forgery and replay of alert messages in transit. To deal with replay of alerts a CAP document contains the mandatory
              &lt;identifier&gt;, &lt;sender&gt;, &lt;sent&gt; elements and
              an optional &lt;expire&gt; element. These attributes make the CAP document
              unique for a specific sender and provide time restrictions. An entity that has
              received a CAP message already within the indicated timeframe is able to detect a
              replayed message and, if the content of that message is unchanged, then no additional
              security vulnerability is created. Additionally, it is RECOMMENDED to make use of SIP
              security mechanisms, such as SIP Identity <xref target="RFC4474"/>, to tie the 
              CAP message to the SIP message. To provide protection of the entire SIP message exchange between neighboring SIP entities the usage of TLS is mandatory.</t> 
  
<t>Note that none of the security mechanism in this document protect against a compromised sensor sending crafted alerts.</t>
