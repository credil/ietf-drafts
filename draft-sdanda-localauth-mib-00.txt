1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578, STD 58, RFC 2579 and STD 58, RFC 2580.

2.  Introduction

   Authentication, Authorization and Accounting enables the user to
   allow the control access to system resources.  For small enterprise
   network deployments that provide network access to hundreds of users,
   one may not need to have dedicated AAA servers for authenticating the
   users.  For such scenarios, the user information or profiles can be
   stored locally at the network element.  Thus, in that network
   deployment context, it is useful collect Authentication logs at the
   network element.  This draft defines an portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects
   to monitor Local authenticated users.

3.  Terminology

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
   described in [RFC2903].  Unless otherwise stated, the mechanisms
   described therein will not be re-described here.

4.  Brief Description of MIB Objects

   This section describes objects pertaining to Local Authenticated
   users with specific information related to the MIB module specified
   in this document.

   The Local Authenticated MIB has one module named LocalAuthUserMIB
   which is focussed on describing users authenticated locally by
   Network Access Server.

4.1.  Local Auth User Table (lauUserTable)

   The lauUserTable lists the currently configured local users.  For
   each user object, it provides information and statistics about the
   local users.

       DESCRIPTION
           "This MIB module defines objects describing users
           authenticated locally by a Network Access Server (NAS).

               +--------+      +--------+        +---------+
               |        |      |        |        |         |

               |        |      |  (NAS) |        |         |
               +--------+      +--------+        +---------+


           A client is a telnet or SSH user needing access to the NAS
           box directly. Network user like PPP or dot1x will request
           NAS box for authentication to access the network.

           NAS box authenticates user present in the local user
           database.

           GLOSSARY

           Network Access Server ( NAS )
           A single point of access to a remote resource and is
           exclusively used with Authentication, Authorization
           and Accounting.

           Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
           A data link protocol commonly used in establishing a
           direct connection between two networking nodes."

6.  Security Considerations

   It is important to control GET access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them over the
   network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such
   a secure environment.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec",
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the objects
   in these MIB modules.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see RFC3410, section 8), including
   full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for
   authentication and privacy".

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to

   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals "users" that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them.

7.  IANA Considerations

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        localAuthUserMIB     { mib-2 XXX }


   [Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.]
