      <t>
	This draft specifies extensions to the ICMPv6 Router
	Advertisement messages and processing.  Traditionally,
	prefixes contained in RAs are used for on-link determination,
	on-link address auto-configuration, but not for path setup
	towards multi-hop destinations.  The extensions proposed here
	still rely on RAs being communicated on a single link (not
	across several IP hops), but upon RA reception the prefixes
	are installed in the routing table; they are thus used for
	forwarding packets further than a single link (multi IP hop).
      </t>
      <t>
	We present the message exchange diagrams, message formats and
	algorithm executed by a node.  The scenarios implying route
	addition are: simultaneous power-up of 3 Mobile Routers,
	arrival of a MR in a zone where other MRs are present; and
	scenarios for route deletion: timeout expiration of route
	entry, and explicit deletion of route entry.
      </t>
      <t>
	These RA extensions are intended for path establishment
	between LFNs in separate moving networks.  The Mobile Routers
	in charge of moving networks exchange their prefixes (with
	RAs), and set up their routing tables. The exchanged prefixes scopes
	are global <xref target='RFC4291'/> or local <xref target='RFC4193'/>.
	In practice, applications may treat "Unique Local Addresses" 
	<xref target='RFC4193'/> as global scoped addresses.
      </t>
      <t>
	The mechanism presented in this draft is an evolution of an
	earlier work <xref target='I-D.petrescu-manemo-nano' />.  This
	document adds the behaviour for MR arrival at a zone where
	other MRs are present, and the behaviour for route deletion.
      </t>
      <t>
	A similar mechanism is presented in "Mobile Network Prefix
	Provisioning" <xref target='I-D.jhlee-mext-mnpp' />.  The
	'MNPP' draft addresses a specific need of inter-connecting
	vehicular networks; it considers use cases with or without
	fixed Access Point (infrastructure-based and
	infrastructure-less scenarios).  In this draft we do not
	consider the use of an Access Point, neither the
	infrastructure-based scenario.  On another hand, this draft
	describes additional route deletion scenarios, whereas the
	MNPP draft doesn't.
      </t>
      <t>
	Communicating directly between two Mobile Routers, using their
	egress interfaces, and without access to infrastructure can be
	considered as Route Optimization: traffic between LFNs of
	different moving networks is avoiding reaching the respective
	Home Agents (presumably placed in the infrastructure).
	Whereas this RA-based work is not explicitely addressing Route
	Optimization, the effect of updating routing tables can be
	considered to be so; such an effect can be also achieved by
	extensions to the Mobile IPv6 protocol, as is suggested, for
	example, by a recent Internet Draft titled "Mobile IPv6 Route
	Optimization without Home Agent", authored by G. Hampel and
	T. Klein, named draft-hampel-mext-ro-without-ha-00, and posted
	on February 23rd, 2011.  It proposes extensions to Mobile IPv6
	protocol to conduct Route Optimization without Home Agent, in
	particular by introducing a concept of virtual home link and
	virtual home address.

	Several use-cases in the context of a City public
	transportation may take advantage of direct communications
	between vehicles (without infrastructure), or between a
	vehicle and a bus stop.
      </t>
      <section title='Communication between Security Vehicle and RATP
		      Vehicle'>
	<t>
	  The environment consists of a Security Vehicle (such as
	  public safety) and a RATP Vehicle (a bus).  The goal: during
	  an incident happenning within the bus, use a webcam to
	  inform the security agents (in the security vehicle) about
	  the ongoing event developments.  The use-case: a bus is
	  driven along a typical scheduled drive.  A passenger
	  aggression incident is declared within bus.  The driver
	  silently triggers the red-button alarm.  The security
	  vehicle approaches bus and agents query the live video feed
	  sent by the bus webcam.  This is illustrated in the
	  following figure:

      <section title='RATP Vehicle (bus) Approaching a Bus Stop'>
	<t>
	  The environment consists of an RATP vehicle (a typical
	  public transportation bus) and a bus stop equipped of a WiFi
	  Access Point.  The goal: augment the precision of waiting
	  time reporting to passenger waiting at the bus stop.
	  Currently, the waiting time is reported on a display at the
	  bus stop; its precision is in the order of 1-2 minutes
	  (i.e. it may happen that the display reports 2minute wait
	  time whereas the bus is actually at 30second distance).  The
	  bus is equipped of a GPS receiver.  Use-case: the passenger
	  is waiting at the bus stop.  S/he scans the wait time
	  reported on the display.  When the bus is within a range of
	  200 meter the display reports "Approaching"; when the bus is
	  within a 25 meter range the display reports ("At the stop").

      <section title='Visualizing Bus Stop Prior to Arrival'>
	<t>
	  The environments consists of a RATP vehicle and a WiFi
	  station at the bus stop.  Goal: ability to access a webcam
	  deployed at the bus stop, which allows the bus driver to see
	  how crowded the stop is and the type of potential
	  passengers.  It thus offers the driver the opportunity to
	  plan the fitting of the bus on the arrival ramp.  Use-case:
	  the bus approaches the bus stop; the driver sees on the
	  screen the passengers waiting at the stop; the driver
	  notices the presence of a stroller and a wheelchair; the
	  driver prepares the correct arrival at the ramp and
	  extension of the arm serving mobility.

    <section anchor='protocol' title='Protocol'>
      <section title='Topology'>
      <t>
	These RA protocol extensions were conceived in a context of
	vehicular networks.  It was considered that a vehicle contains
	a moving network.  A moving network is composed of one Mobile
	Router (MR) and several Local Fixed Nodes (LFNs).  The MR has
	one egress interface and one ingress interface.  The egress
	interface is used to connect to other vehicles whereas the
	ingress interface connects to the LFNs in the vehicle.
      </t>
      <t>
	For example, two moving networks connecting via their egress
	interfaces are depicted below:

      </t>

      <t>
	In this figure, the Mobile Network Prefix (MNP) deployed in
	vehicle 1 is 2001:db8:1::/40, for example.  If ULA addresses are in 
	use inside the vehicles (convenient for communications between a 
	limited set of sites), the above figure prefixes could be, for
	example: FD78:ADC8:857A::/48 and FDD3:48A5:2D72::/48 for vehicles 1
	and 2, respectively. For more information about ULA prefixes 
	generation, please refer to <xref target='RFC4193'/> It is also 
	possible for a MR to generate ULA prefixes based on its Vehicular 
	Identification Number (VIN). The use of VIN numbers to generate ULA 
	prefixes will be detailed in a future draft. The problem is how to 
	establish IP paths between the LFNs between the two vehicles; 
	initially the MR in one vehicle only knows about the MNP in its own 
	vehicle.
      </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Operation on a Mobile Router'>

      <t>
	We propose to use a special kind of prefixes in the Router
	Advertisements.  MR sends RA on its egress interface.  A
	receiving MR installs the pair MNP-LL in its forwarding
	information base (routing table, destination cache, tbd).
      </t>

      <t>
	Each Mobile Router maintains a forwarding information
	structure that contains entries of the form:
      </t>

      <t>
	<list style='symbols'>
	  <t>
	    Mobile Network Prefix
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Gateway address	    
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Lifetime
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Name of outgoing interface
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Optionally link-layer address of Gateway
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>

      <t>
	This data structure is managed mainly at the reception of the
	special Router Advertisements, and when timers expire.  This
	structure can be implemented as part of the Destination Cache,
	Binding Cache, Routing Table or Forwarding Information Base.
      </t>
      <t>
	We present more details of the MR operation in the following
	section.

	<t>
	  <list style='symbols'>
	    <t>
	      All Mobile Routers connect their egress interface with a
	      wireless MAC protocol, for example 802.11 MAC.  We
	      consider mainly the case where the "ad-hoc" mode is
	      used; we do not consider the presence of an Access Point
	      - the two moving networks should be able to connect to
	      each other without the use of fixed Access Points.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      Following link-layer successful connectivity, each
	      Mobile Router joins the all-routers multicast address on
	      the egress interface (typically using a link-local
	      address, pictured as LL1).
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      Each Mobile Router multicasts special RAs on the egress
	      interface, containing the Mobile Network Prefix that is
	      assigned to its moving network. A Mobile Router SHOULD wait 
	      for a random delay <xref target='RFC4861'/> before sending the 
	      special RA. If the first special RA contains a ULA prefix, 
	      the next special RAs sent should contain ULA prefixes as well,
	      if available. This is to avoid "mixing" ULA addresses 
	      <xref target='RFC4193'/> and global addresses 
	      <xref target='RFC4291'/> in the same packet. This is not
	      forbidden though.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      When receiving the special RA from another MR, a MR
	      parses the packet for the link-local address of the
	      sending MR, for the MNP sent by that MR and for the
	      lifetime.  It then installs the corresponding entry into
	      the data structure mentioned earlier.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      Before leaving the Fixed Scene, a Mobile Router sends
	      another special RA to all routers this time informing
	      them that the MNP-linklocaladdress pair is no longer
	      present at the scene (lifetime 0 as per <xref
	      target='RFC4191'/>), so the other routers delete the
	      corresponding route.  It could also courteously
	      multicast a MLD REPORT to leave the all-routers
	      multicast group, if necessary. This Mobile Router SHOULD wait
	      for a random delay before sending the special RA message.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      Operation of the Mobile Router when forwarding packets
	      (after installation of the MNP-ll route) is similar to
	      that of any router: for each packet not addressed to
	      itself, longest-prefix match the destination address of
	      the packet to an entry in the table, select the
	      'gateway' address, solicit that neighbour's MAC address
	      and put the received MAC address in the link-layer dst
	      address then send it.
	    </t>
	    
	  </list>

	</t>

	<t>
	  With this mechanism, the various LFNs in the moving networks
	  are capable to exchange IP messages, routed by two Mobile
	  Routers each time. Longest-prefix match can still be used to take 
	  the next hop forwarding decision regardless whether the 
	  destination address is global scoped or Unique Local IPv6 address.
	</t>

	  the other Mobile Routers, a certain Mobile Router can
	  send a special Router Solicitation right after joining
	  the scene. A random delay <xref target='RFC4861'/> SHOULD be 
	  introduced before sending any RS/RA message in order to prevent 
	  RS/RA storms when several Mobile Routers join or leave the Fixed 
	  Scene.

	  The arriving MR is the one using the Mobile Router MR3.  MR1
	  and MR2 have already exchanged their respective routes using
	  the message exchange presented in the previous scenario.
	  The algorithm executed by MR3 is the following: (1) Send an
	  RA containing the prefix(es) allocated to its subnets to
	  which the ingress interfaces are connected (2) "Join" the
	  all-routers multicast address with link-scope, on its egress
	  interface (3) Send a Router Solicitation (RS) on its egress
	  interface requesting RAs from MR1 and MR2 (4) Receive their
	  special RAs: RA1 and RA2 (5) For each received RA, extract
	  the source address and the prefixes and insert the
	  corresponding number of routing table entries; these entries
	  will help reach the LFNs in the moving networks of MR1 and
	  MR2.

	  This first scenario for deleting a routing table entry
	  consists in associating a timeout value on each entry
	  present in the routing table.  Such an entry typically
	  contains the destination prefix, the IP address of the next
	  hop gateway and eventually the interface name.  The new
	  timeout value is obtained from the "Lifetime" field of the
	  RA.  With this value, each MR executes the following
	  algorithm for each entry present in its routing table: (1)
	  Set variable lt to the contents of the timeout value of the
	  routing table entry (2) Decrement lt (3) Wait 1 milisecond
	  (4) If lt is different than 0 jump to step 2, otherwise jump
	  to step 5 (5) Delete this entry (6) Send an RS to the
	  next-hop IP address of this routing table entry (7) If an RA
	  is received then re-insert the routing table entry.
	</t>

	<t>
	  The second scenario for deleting routing table entries
	  consists in an explicit indication by a Mobile Router to
	  other Mobile Routers about its intention to quit the subnet,
	  instructing them to remove the routing table entries
	  relative to its subnets (their MNPs: Mobile Network
	  Prefixes).  The explicit indication is part of the same
	  special Router Advertisement.  In practice, this effect
	  could be achieved in two different ways: either specify a
	  'D' flag for a certain MNP, or alternatively use a lifetime
	  '0' attached to same MNP ('0' meaning that the deletion
	  request is immediate).
	</t>

	<t>
	  The message exchange for explicit deletion is depicted in
	  the figure below.  The Mobile Router MR1 sends RA1
	  containing the indication for immediate deletion (flag 'D',
	  or lifetime '0') and the mobile network prefix MNP1.  Upon
	  receipt of this message, MR2 and MR3 search their respective
	  routing tables for the MNP1 and then delete these routing
	  table entries.

      </t>

      <t>
	SeND [RFC3971] permits to bind an address to a public key.  But not a

      <t>
	In some cases it is possible that a moving network is

	Some kinds of link layers used for establishing the link
