1.  Introduction

   This note recommends an approach to the automated allocation of /64
   prefixes within a network.  This not something that will be done in a
   heavily-managed network, but may be appropriate in networks with
   light management, such as residential and SOHO networks.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Theory of Operation

   The premise is that some party allocates a prefix to a network, such
   as a PA /48 or /56.  The obvious way is using DHCP-PD [RFC3633],
   although that is not actually required.

   IS-IS [ISO.10589.1992] represents those destinations as a type-
   length-value field that identifies an address.  For CLNS, it was
   designed to the ISO NSAP; by various extensions, it also handles IPv4
   and IPv6 prefixes and their counterparts for other protocols.  In
   this model, we add a TLV to advertise the delegated prefix, with the
   expectation that routers in the network (including pseudo-nodes) will
   allocate more specific prefixes from that prefix.

Internet-Draft        Automated Prefix Management          February 2013


   In short, some specified system in the network, potentially a
   configuration management system or the CPE router facing an upstream
   network, is configured with an autoconfiguration prefix, and manages
   the use of that prefix in the network.

2.1.  Autoconfiguration TLV Advertisement

   Upon recognizing that it has been configured with a prefix and that
   the network management policy is for autoconfiguration, the system in
   question advertises the autoconfiguration prefix described in
   Section 3 within the intended area or network.

2.2.  Subnet prefix allocation and announcement

   Each router advertising a Reachability TLV [RFC5308], including a
   pseudonode on a LAN, when it receives the Autoconfiguration TLV
   Advertisement, calculates and announces a more specific prefix from
   the advertised autoconfiguration prefix in a Reachability TLV.  This
   prefix is chosen at random, but may not collide with any prefix
   currently advertised within the network and therefore in the LSP
   database.

   There are obvious caveats here: if the autoconfiguration prefix is
   too long and as a result there are more LANs than there are prefixes
   to allocate to them, the procedure breaks down badly, and if there
   are just exactly enough, it may take time to converge.  Hence, from
   an operational perspective, the autoconfiguration prefix should have
   enough /64 more specific prefixes, and from an implementation
   perspective, the randomization function must be sufficiently robust,
   that independent choices are unlikely to collide.

   In the event of collision, which is likely to happen from time to
   time, it is up to the nodes advertising the prefix in question to
   detect and resolve the situation.  Upon receiving an LSP containing
   its "own" prefix advertised by another router, each router waits
   CollisionDetect (10) seconds, to give the network ample opportunity
   to detect the issue.  It then waits an additional random interval
   between zero and CollisionDetect seconds, to randomize the recovery
   process and maximize the chance that replacement prefixes do not
   collide.  It then allocates a new prefix following the procedure
   described in this section, and re-announces its LSP, removing (and
   therefore withdrawing) the offending reachability TLV, and instead
   announcing the new one.

   Subsequent procedures, such as the advertisement of Router
   Advertisement using the allocated prefix or DHCPv6 allocation of
   addresses, may start CollisionDetect seconds after the LSP has been
   announced if no collision has been detected.  At this point, routers
   MAY store their /64s in non-volatile storage.

2.3.  Autoconfiguration TLV Withdrawal

   When the prefix advertised in the Autoconfiguration TLV expires or is
   withdrawn, the Autoconfiguration TLV is withdrawn from the network.
   Upon detection of the withdrawal, each router in the network MUST
   withdraw any addresses or prefixes dependent on it.  If those
   prefixes are stored in non-volatile storage, they MUST also be
   removed.

2.4.  Renumbering using autoconfiguration

   [RFC4192] describes the process of renumbering in some detail.  The
   discussion here is somewhat simplistic; refer to that for a more
   detailed discussion.

   In short, "renumbering" a network is a special case of "numbering" a
   network.  If there is one prefix in use in a network and it is
   withdrawn, the network will experience an outage.  Hence, it is
   generally advisable to ensure that there are at least two prefixes in
   use in a network when one of them is removed.  This might be
   accomplished by simply using multiple prefixes in the network; it
   might also be accomplished by deploying a second autoconfiguration
   prefix minutes or hours before the "old" one is removed.  During that
   time, DNS and DHCP databases need to be updated as described in
   [RFC4192] to reflect the new prefix.

   If an outage is acceptable, it is also possible to renumber using the
   same prefix.  For this, the administration withdraws the prefix as
   described in Section 2.3 and waits until the process is complete.
   There are two obvious ways to determine completion:

   o  Wait long enough that it is highly unlikely to have not completed,
      which might be the number of routers in the network diameter times
      the LSP update retransmission interval, or

   o  Wait until the managing router's LSP database contains no
      Reachability TLVs that depend on the prefix.

   At this point, any systems that are only using that prefix are now
   unreachable using global addressing.

Internet-Draft        Automated Prefix Management          February 2013


   At this point, the managing system may re-advertise the prefix as
   described in Section 2.1, and the routers in the network will re-
   allocate prefixes as described in Section 2.3.

3.  IPv6 Autoconfiguration TLV

   The structure of the Autoconfiguration TLV is as follows:


   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Type = IANA  |    Length     |U|X|   Reserve |  Prefix Len   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Prefix ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      * - if present
      U - up/down bit
      X - external original bit


                      Figure 1: Autoconfiguration TLV

   As is described in [RFC5305]: "The up/down bit SHALL be set to 0 when
   a prefix is first injected into IS-IS.  If a prefix is advertised
   from a higher level to a lower level (e.g.  level 2 to level 1), the
   bit SHALL be set to 1, indicating that the prefix has traveled down
   the hierarchy.  Prefixes that have the up/down bit set to 1 may only
   be advertised down the hierarchy, i.e., to lower levels".

   If the prefix was distributed into IS-IS from another routing
   protocol, the external bit SHALL be set to 1.  This information is
   useful when distributing prefixes from IS-IS to other protocols.

   The prefix is "packed" in the data structure.  That is, only the
   required number of octets of prefix are present.  This number can be
   computed from the prefix length octet as follows:

      prefix octets = integer of ((prefix length + 7) / 8)

4.  IANA Considerations

   This section will request an identifying value for the TLV defined.
   This is deferred to the -01 version of the draft.

5.  Security Considerations

   To be considered.
