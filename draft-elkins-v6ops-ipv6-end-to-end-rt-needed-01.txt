          End-to-end Response Time Needed for IPv6 Diagnostics
            draft-elkins-v6ops-ipv6-end-to-end-rt-needed-01

Abstract

   To diagnose performance and connectivity problems, metrics on real
   (non-synthetic) transmission are critical for timely end-to-end
   problem resolution. Such diagnostics may be real-time or after the
   fact, but must not impact an operational production network. The base
   metrics are: packet sequence number and packet timestamp.  Metrics
   derived from these will be described separately. This document
   provides the background and rationale for the requirement for end-to-
   end response time.

1  Background

   To diagnose performance and connectivity problems, metrics on real
   (non-synthetic) transmission are critical for timely end-to-end
   problem resolution. Such diagnostics may be real-time or after the
   fact, but must not impact an operational production network. The base
   metrics are: packet sequence number and packet timestamp.  Metrics
   derived from these will be described separately. This document
   provides the background and rationale for the requirement for end-to-
   end response time.

   For background, please see draft-ackermann-tictoc-pdm-ntp-usage-00
   [ACKPDM], draft-elkins-v6ops-ipv6-packet-sequence-needed-01 [ELKPSN],
   draft-elkins-v6ops-ipv6-pdm-recommended-usage-01 [ELKPUSE], draft-
   elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-02 [ELKPDM] and draft-elkins-ippm-
   pdm-metrics-00 [ELKIPPM]. These drafts are companions to this
   document.    

   As discussed in the above Internet Drafts, current methods are
   inadequate for these purposes because they assume unreasonable access
   to intermediate devices, are cost prohibitive, require infeasible
   changes to a running production network, or do not provide timely
   data. The IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics destination option
   (PDM) provides a solution to these problems.  This document will
   detail the background and need for end-to-end response time.

1.1 Why End-to-end Response Time is Needed

   The timestamps in the PDM traveling along with the packet will be
   used to calculate end-to-end response time, without requiring agents
   in devices along the path. In many networks, end-to-end response
   times are a critical component of Service Levels Agreements (SLAs). 

   End-to-end response is what the user of a network system actually
   experiences.  When the end user is an individual, he is generally
   indifferent to what is happening along the network; what he really
   cares about is how long it takes to get a response back.  But this is
   not just a matter of individuals' personal convenience.  In many
   cases, rapid response is critical to the business being conducted.  

   When the end user is a device (e.g. with the Internet of Things),
   what matters is the speed with which requested data can be
   transferred -- specifically, whether the requested data can be
   transferred in time to accomplish the desired actions.  This can be
   important when the relevant external conditions are subject to rapid
   change.

   Response time and consistency are not just "nice to have".  On many

   networks, the impact can be financial hardship or endanger human
   life.  In some cities, the emergency police contact system operates
   over IP, law enforcement uses TCP/IP networks, our stock exchanges
   are settled using IP networks.  The critical nature of such
   activities to our daily lives and financial well-being demand a
   solution.  Section 1.5 will detail the current state of end-to-end
   response time monitoring today.

1.2 Trending of Response Time Data

   In addition to the need for tracking current service, end-to-end
   response time is valuable for capacity planning.  By tracking
   response times, and identifying trends, it becomes possible to
   determine when network capacity is being approached.  This allows
   additional capacity to be obtained before service levels fall below
   requirements.  Without that kind of tracking, the only option is to
   wait until there is a problem, and then scramble to get additional
   capacity on an emergency (and probably high cost) basis.

   The documents draft-elkins-v6ops-ipv6-pdm-recommended-usage-01
   [ELKPUSE] and draft-elkins-ippm-pdm-metrics-00 [ELKIPPM] will detail
   use for the PDM for capacity planning purposes.

1.3 What to measure?

   End to end response time can be broken down into 3 parts:

   - Network delay 
   - Application (or server) delay
   - Client delay

   Network delay may be one-way delay [RFC2679] or round-trip delay
   [RFC2681].

   Additionally, network delay may include multiple hops.  Application
   and server delay include operating system by stack time.  By and
   large, the three timings are 'good enough' measurements to allow
   rapid triage into the failing component.

   Ways are available (provided by operating systems) to measure
   Application and Client times.  Network time can also be measured in
   isolation via some of the measurement techniques described in section
   1.5. The most difficult portion is to integrate network time with the
   server or application times.  Products exist to do this but are
   available at an exorbitant cost, require agents, and will likely
   become more prohibitive as the speed of networks grow and as the
   world becomes more connected via mobile devices.  This is discussed
   in detail in section 1.5.

INTERNET DRAFT -elkins-v6ops-ipv6-end-to-end-rt-needed-01   October 2013


   Measuring network time requires precise timestamps.  Furthermore,
   those timestamps need to occur at the end-points of the transactions
   being measured.  And they need to be available, regardless of the
   protocol being used by the transaction.  Which is to say, the
   timestamp has to be available in one of the extensions to the IP
   header - this is provided by the PDM.

1.4 TCP Timestamp not enough

   Some suggest that the TCP Timestamp option might be sufficient to
   calculate end-to-end response time.

   The TCP Timestamp Option is defined in RFC1323 [RFC1323].  The reason
   for the TCP Timestamp option is to be able to discard packets when
   the TCP sequence number wraps.  (PAWS)

   The problems with the TCP Timestamp option are:

   1.  Not everyone turns this on. 

   2.  It is only available for TCP applications 

   3.  No time synchronization between sender and receiver.

   4.  No indication of date in long-running connections. (That is
   connections which last longer than one day) 

   5.  The granularity of the timestamp is at best at millisecond level.
   In the future, as speeds of devices and networks grow, this level of
   granularity will be inadequate.  Even today, on many networks, the
   timings are at microsecond level not millisecond.

1.5 Inadequacy of Current Instrumentation Technology

   The current technology includes:

   1.  Synthetic transactions

   2.  Pings

   3.  Other Estimates of network time

   4.  Server / Client Agents 

1.5.1 Synthetic transactions

1.5.2 PING An ICMP ping measures network time. First, you can PING the
   remote device.  Then you assume that the time it takes to get a

INTERNET DRAFT -elkins-v6ops-ipv6-end-to-end-rt-needed-01   October 2013


   response to a PING is the same as the time that a transaction
   (regardless of packet size) would take to traverse the network.
   However, QoS rules, firewalls, etc. may mean that PING, (and other
   synthetic transactions) may not be subject to the same conditions. 

1.5.3 Other Estimates of Network Time

   If a packet trace is done, it is possible to look at the time between
   when a response was seen to be sent at the packet capture device and
   when the ACK for the response comes back.   

   If you assume that the ACK took the same amount of time as the
   original query, you have the network time. Unfortunately, the time
   for the ACK may not be the same as the time for a much larger query
   transaction to traverse the network.  

   The biggest problem with this method is that of TCP delayed
   acknowledgements.  If the client is doing delayed ACKs, then the ACK
   will be held until the next request is ready to go out.  In this
   case, the time to receive the ACK has no correlation with network
   time.

1.5.4 Server / Client Agents

   There are also products which claim that they can determine end-to-
   end response times, integrating server and network times - and indeed
   they can do so. But they require agents which must be placed at each
   point which is to be monitored.  That is, it is necessary to add
   those agents EVERYWHERE around the network, at a very high cost. 
   These kind of products can be purchased by only the richest 1% of the
   corporations. As the speed of networks grow, and as the world becomes
   more connected via mobile devices, such products will only become
   more expensive.  If, indeed, their technology can keep up.  

   TCP/IP networks today are used throughout the world.  The need for
   adequate performance will become more and more critical.  A method
   that is scalable and affordable is needed to ensure this growth. 

2 Solution Parameters

   What is needed is: 

   1) A method to identify and/or track the behavior of a connection
   without assuming access to the transport devices. 

   2) A method to observe a connection in flight without introducing
   agents.

INTERNET DRAFT -elkins-v6ops-ipv6-end-to-end-rt-needed-01   October 2013


   3) a method to observe arbitrary flows at multiple points within a
   network and correlate the results of those observations in a
   consistent manner. 

   4) A method to signal and correlate transport issues to application
   end-to-end behavior.

   5) A method which does not require changes to a production network in
   real time. 

   6) Adequate granularity in the measurement technique to provide the
   needed metrics.

   7) A method that is scalable to very large networks.

   8) A method that is affordable to all.

2.1 Rationale for proposed solution

   The current IPv6 specification does not provide a timestamp number
   nor similar field in the IPv6 main header or in any extension header.
    So, we propose the IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
   destination option (PDM) [ELKPDM].

2.2 Merits of timestamp in PDM  

   Advantages include: 

   1.  Less overhead than other alternatives. 

   2.  Real measure of actual transactions. 

   3.  Less cost to provide solutions

   4.  More accurate and complete information.

   5.  Independence from transport layer protocols.    

   6.  Ability to span organizational boundaries with consistent
   instrumentation

   In other words, this is a solution to a long-standing problem.  The
   PDM will provide a metric which will allow those responsible for
   network support to determine what is happening in their network
   without expensive equipment (agents) at each device.

   The PDM does not solve every response time issue for every situation.
   Network connections with multiple hops will still need more granular

INTERNET DRAFT -elkins-v6ops-ipv6-end-to-end-rt-needed-01   October 2013


   metrics, as will the differentiation between multiple components at
   each host.  That is, TCP/IP stack time vs. applications time will
   still need to be broken out by client software.  What the PDM does
   provide is triage.  That is, to determine quickly if the problem is
   in the network or in the server or application.

2.3 What kind of timestamp?

   Questions arise about exactly the kind of timestamp to use.  Both the
   Network Time Protocol (NTP) [RFC5905] and Precision Time Protocol
   (PTP) [IEEE1588] are used to provide timing on TCP/IP networks.

   NTP has evolved within the IETF structure while PTP has evolved
   within the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
   community.  By and large, operating systems such as Windows, Linux,
   and IBM mainframe computers use NTP. These are the source and
   destination systems for packets. Intermediate nodes such as routers
   and switches may prefer PTP.

   Since we are describing a new extension header for destination
   systems, the timestamp to be used will be in accordance with NTP.  In
   the documents, draft-ackermann-tictoc-pdm-ntp-usage-00 [ACKPDM] and  
   draft-elkins-v6ops-ipv6-pdm-recommended-usage-01 [ELKPUSE], we will
   discuss guidelines for implementing NTP for use with the PDM.



3  Backward Compatibility

   The scheme proposed in this document is backward compatible with all
   the currently defined IPv6 extension headers. According to RFC2460
   [RFC2460], if the destination node does not recognize this option, it
   should skip over this option and continue processing the header.

4  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations.


5  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.
