Abstract

   This specification defines an extension to the IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery protocol and the stateless address autoconfiguration
   procedure.  A new Prefix Information Option with meta data is defined
   that describe the properties and other prefix class meta data
   associated with the prefix.  The stateless address autoconfiguration
   procedure and end hosts can make use of the additional properties and
   class information when selecting prefixes for a particular uses and
   use cases.  This specification updates RFC4861 and also updates
   RFC4862.

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Prefix Properties                July 2013


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a new neighbor discovery protocol message
   option, the Prefix Information Option with Meta Data (PIOMT), that
   indicate, for example, the mobility management properties associated
   to the prefix, and a class value that conveys metadata associated to
   the prefix with a local administrative domain wide importance.
   Furthermore, the specification discusses corresponding source address
   selection hint flags to the IPv6 Socket API for Source Address
   Selection [RFC5014].

   For example, the IPv6 Socket API for Source Address Selection
   [RFC5014] already covers Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275] and allows selecting
   between a home address (HoA) and a care-of address (CoA).  A mobile
   node (MN) with a client based mobility IP stack is supposed to know
   which prefixes are CoA(s) and/or HoA(s).  However, this is not the
   case with network based mobility management where the MN is expected
   to be agnostic of the mobility support.  There has been attempts in
   past to define similar functionality for the mobility protocols
   purposes [I-D.damic-6man-pmip6-ind].  Outside the mobility protocols,
   there are other potential use cases where associating properties to
   the advertised prefixes could be useful as discussed in
   [I-D.bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix].

   The extensions to [RFC4861] are minimal in a sense that they do not
   define new functionality, for example, to any existing mobility
   protocol but instead add an explicit indication of network based
   mobility knowledge into the IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration
   (SLAAC) [RFC4862].  The new functionality is achieved by defining a
   new, backward compatible, option to IPv6 router advertisements that
   convey the required prefix related meta data information the SLAAC
   procedure may take use of.

   This would allow for network based mobility solutions, such as Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] or GTP [TS.29274] to explicitly indicate that
   their prefixes have mobility, and therefore, the MN IP stack can make
   an educated selection between prefixes that have mobility and those
   that do not.  There is also a potential need to extend both [RFC3493]
   and [RFC5014] in order to provide required hooks into socket APIs.

   The underlying assumption is that a MN has multiple prefixes to
   choose from.  Typically this means either the MN has multiple
   interfaces or an interface has been configured with multiple
   prefixes.  This specification does not make a distinction between
   these alternatives and does not either make any assumptions how the
   possible transfer of a prefix is done between interfaces in the case
   a network based mobility solution is used.

2.  Background and Motivation

   This section discusses the motivations behind adding metadata and
   other address selection decision making affecting information into
   IPv6 prefixes.  The additional information is conveyed from the
   network to a end host during the IPv6 address configuration phase.
   The motivation example taken from and discussed below is from the
   mobile networks.

   IP mobility and its centralized topological anchoring of IP addresses
   has known issues.  For instance, non-optimal routing is a classical
   example.  Another concerns include excessive tunneling, increased
   signaling due the maintenance of mobility related bindings,
   aggregation of traffic to centralized mobility anchor gateways and
   unnecessary IP mobility related state management for IP traffic that
   does not as such benefit from mobility.  In general, it is observed
   that most applications do not need IP level mobility, and work just
   fine with "temporary" IP addresses that come and go.  However, IP
   mobility still has its virtues making the applications unaware of
   mobility, and certain wireless mobile networking architecture make
   extensive use of network based IP mobility.

   In order to overcome some of the above issues, use of local resources
   and topologically local addressing could be enhanced.  In many cases
   this would lead to use of multiple addresses of which some provide
   mobility and some do not.  However, an end host has to have means to
   distinguish between addresses that provide mobility, and those that
   are short lived and usable only within a limited topological area.

   [I-D.seite-dmm-dma] and [I-D.draft-liu-dmm-dynamic-anchor-discussion]
   discuss the dynamic anchor solution for distributed mobility
   management.  The idea is to use the local allocated prefix for any
   newly initiated 'IP session' and use the previously allocated prefix
   for the ongoing sessions.  This specification can be used to
   implement the prefix selection for dynamic anchoring.  For example,
   both the locally allocated and the remotely allocated/anchored
   prefixes can be identified by the prefix property option as described
   in Section 3.2.

   This specification also shares similar motivations for classifying
   the prefix as described in [I-D.bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix].
   Some service providers may wish to allocate specific prefixes for
   some services or type of traffic.  In this situation, the end host
   must be able to classify prefixes according to type of service.

   This specification provides tools for extending the IPv6 address
   management and source address selection so that end hosts (and their
   applications) can select a proper address for their needs.  This

   specification complements [I-D.bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix] by
   providing the SLAAC version of the additional prefix related meta
   data information delivery compared to the DHCPv6 stateful approach.


3.  Option Formats

3.1.  Prefix Information Option with Meta Data

   This specification defines a new neighbor discovery protocol message
   option, the Prefix Information Option with Meta Data (PIOMT), to be
   used in router advertisement messages.  The PIOMT is treated exactly
   the same as [RFC4861] Prefix Information Option (PIO) except with an
   addition of new meta data suboptions.

   The PIOMT can coexist with RFC4861 PIO.  The prefixes advertised in
   both PIOMT and PIO can even be the same.  It is up to the receiving
   end host to select the appropriate prefix(es) for configuring its
   IPv6 addresses.  In a case the PIO and the PIOMT share the same
   prefix, then all the other parameter (like flags and lifetimes) MUST
   be the same.

   Type

       Set to TBD1.

   Length

       4 if no suboptions are present.  Greater than 4 if one or more
       suboptions are present.

   Suboptions

       Zero or more suboptions that describe properties and other meta
       data attached to the advertised prefix.  See Section 3.2 for
       description of the meta data suboption format and suboptions
       already defined in this specification.  The existence of
       suboptions can be determined from the length field.  If the
       length is greater than 4, then at least one suboption MUST be
       present.

   Rest of the fields are handled exactly as described in Section 4.6.2.
   of RFC4861 [RFC4861].

3.2.  Meta Data Suboptions

   The generic suboption format for the PIO with meta data (PIOMT) is
   shown in Figure 2.  The suboption follows the alignment and length
   rules familiar from [RFC4861].  On a particular note, the flag 'C'
   describes whether the suboption is mandatory to understand by the
   receiver or not.  If 'C' is set to zero (0), the receiver can
   silently discard an unknown suboption and skip to the next suboption.
   If 'C' is set to one (1), then an unknown suboption causes the
   receiver to silently discard the entire PIOMT and no further
   suboptions need to be parsed.  There can be multiple instances of the
   same suboption type in one PIOMT option.

   router advertisement message with a PIOMT and the prefix properties
   suboption, it can use the suboption information as an additional hint
   for selecting the prefix for a desired purpose and use case.  The
   prefix properties have global meaning i.e., they have the same
   treatment and handling cross administrative domains.  The value for
   the 'C' flag SHOULD be one (1).  This also implies that if the prefix
   properties bit vector has a flag bit set, which the receiving end
   host does not understand and the 'C' flag is also set, then the whole
   PIOMT option MUST be discarded.

   router advertisement message with a PIOMT and the prefix class
   suboption, it can use the suboption information as an additional hint
   for selecting the prefix for a desired purpose and use case.  The
   prefix class has only local administrative meaning i.e., they are
   local to the access network and may overlap both semantically and
   registry wise across different administrative domains.  How the
   boundaries of an administrative domain are determined is outside the
   scope of this specification.  The value for the 'C' flag SHOULD be
   zero (0).

4.  Host Considerations

4.1.  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration Enhancements

   This specification extends to the [RFC4862] Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).  As described in Section 3.1, a new
   [RFC4861] PIO like option PIOMT can be used to either complement or
   entirely replace the PIO in a router advertisement.  An end host that
   understands the PIOMT option MUST always prefer a prefix found in the
   PIOMT over the same prefix found in the PIO option.

4.2.  Internal Data Structures

   The host internal data structures need to be extended with the
   'prefix property' and the 'prefix class' information associated to
   the learned prefix and configured addresses.  How this is
   accomplished is host implementation specific.  It is also a host
   implementation issue how an application can learn or query both
   properties or class of an address or a prefix.  One possibility is to
   provide such information through the socket API extensions (see
   discussion in [I-D.liu-dmm-mobility-api]).  Other possibilities
   include the use of e.g., ioctl() or NetLink [RFC3549] extensions.

4.3.  Default Address Selection

   The 'prefix property' is only used as a hint.  It does not affect the
   existing [RFC6724] automatically.  A specific rule to host's policy
   table has to be inserted by an application or some daemon process.
   Alternatively, an application can express its address mobility
   property preferences through the socket API extensions (see
   discussion in [I-D.liu-dmm-mobility-api]), which means the socket
   library or middleware has to modify [RFC6724] policy table or
   algorithm.

   The 'prefix properties' flags MAY define the prefix preference for an
   IP stack that understands the extensions defined in this
   specification.  The IP stack SHOULD use the properties preferences to
   supersede [RFC6724] Source Address Selection Rule 8 when selecting a
   default source address among multiple choices and an application has
   not explicitly indicate what kind of source address it prefers.

   The 'prefix class' defines an application 'class' the advertised
   prefix is intended to be used for.  The class has only local
   administrative domain significance.  The 'prefix class' can be used,
   for example, to identify prefixes that are meant to be used reach a

   the local administrative network.  A specific application in the end

   through multiple available addresses and then select a specific
   address to be used for its purposes.


5.  Router Considerations

   A network administrator MAY configure routers complying to this
   specification that also emit router advertisements to include the
   PIOMT option into every router advertisement that would also contain
   the [RFC4861] PIO option.  Since the PIOMT emitting router has no
   prior knowledge whether the end hosts on the link support the PIOMT
   option, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that both [RFC4861] PIO and the
   PIOMT are always included in the router advertisement, even if the
   advertised prefixes were the same.  Whether a router sends router
   advertisements containing the PIOMT options is a local administrative
   decision.

   A router can also make use of the 'C' flag handling in the PIOMT
   suboptions when introducing new functionality into the network.
   Since it is possible to include multiple suboptions of the same type
   into the PIOMT option, the router can easily make a difference
   between e.g., prefix properties that must be understood by the
   receiver and those that can safely be ignored.


6.  Security Considerations

   Existing Prefix Information Option related security considerations
   apply as described in [RFC4861] and [RFC4191].  A malicious node on
   the shared link could include such 'mobility property' flags in a
   Prefix Information Option causing the host to learn wrong information
   regarding the prefix and thus make misguided selection of prefixes on
   the link.  Similarly a malicious middleman on the link could modify
   'mobility property' flags in a Prefix Information Option causing
   misguided selection of prefixes.  In order to avoid on-link attacks,
   SeND [RFC3971] can be used to reject Router Advertisements from
   potentially malicious nodes and guarantee integrity protection of the
   Router Advertisements.


7.  IANA Considerations

   Section 3.1 defines a new IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol option
   type TBD1 for the Prefix Information Option with Meta Data.  The type
   value is defined in the existing 'IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option
   Formats' IANA registry.

   Section 3.2 defines a new IANA registry for the Prefix Information

   Option with Meta Data suboptions.  The registry allocation policy is
   Standards Action [RFC5226].  The initial allocations for the prefix
   properties and prefix class suboptions are listed in Section 3.2.
