Abstract

   Path computation element (PCE) can be used to compute a label
   switched path that spans across multiple domains.  This document
   explain the mechanism of Fast Re-Route (FRR) where a point of local
   repair (PLR) needs to find the appropriate merge point (MP) to do
   bypass path computation using PCE.

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] can be used to perform
   complex path computation in large single domain, multi-domain and
   multi-layered networks.  The PCE can also be used to compute a
   variety of restoration and protection paths and services.

   As stated in [RFC4090], there are two independent methods (one-to-one
   backup and facility backup) of doing fast reroute (FRR).  PCE can be
   used to compute backup path for both the methods.  Cooperating PCEs
   may be used to compute inter-domain backup path.

   In case of one to one backup method, the destination MUST be the
   tail-end of the protected LSP.  Whereas for facility backup,
   destination MUST be the address of the merge point (MP) from the
   corresponding point of local repair (PLR).  The problem of finding
   the MP using the interface addresses or node-ids present in Record
   Route Object (RRO) of protected path can be easily solved in the case
   of a single Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area because the PLR has
   the complete Traffic Engineering Database (TED).  Thus, the PLR can
   unambiguously determine -

   o  The MP address regardless of RRO IPv4 or IPv6 sub-objects
      (interface address or LSR ID).

   o  Is a backup tunnel intersecting a protected TE LSP on MP node
      exists?  This is the case where facility backup tunnel already
      exist either due to another protected TE LSP or it is pre-
      configured.

   It is complex for a PLR to find the MP in case of boundary node
   protection for computing a bypass path because the PLR doesn't have
   the full TED visibility.  When confidentiality (via path key)
   [RFC5520] is enabled, finding MP is very complex.

   This document describes the mechanism to find MP and to setup bypass
   tunnel to protect a boundary node.

3.  Methods to find MP and calculate the optimal backup path

   The Merge Point (MP) address is required at the PLR in order to
   select a bypass tunnel intersecting a protected Traffic Engineering
   Label Switched Path (TE LSP) on a downstream LSR.

   Some implementations may choose to pre-configure a bypass tunnel on
   PLR with destination address as MP.  MP's Domain to be traversed by
   bypass path can be administratively configured or learned via some
   other means (ex Hierarchical PCE (HPCE) [PCE-HIERARCHY-FWK]).  Path
   Computation Client (PCC) on PLR can request its local PCE to compute
   bypass path from PLR to MP, excluding links and node between PLR and
   MP.  At PLR once primary tunnel is up, a pre-configured bypass tunnel
   is bound to the primary tunnel, note that multiple bypass tunnel can
   also exist.

   Most implementations may choose to create a bypass tunnel on PLR
   after primary tunnel is signaled with Record Route Object (RRO) being
   present in primary path's Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Path
   Reserve message.  MP address has to be determined (described below)
   to create a bypass tunnel.  PCC on PLR can request its local PCE to
   compute bypass path from PLR to MP, excluding links and node between
   PLR and MP.

   the failure of link [R2->R3] and node [R3].  R2 is PLR and R4 is MP
   in this case.  Since, both PLR and MP belong to the same area.  The
   problem of finding the MP using the interface addresses or node-ids
   can be easily solved.  Thus, the PLR can unambiguously find the MP
   address regardless of RRO IPv4 or IPv6 sub-objects (interface address
   or LSR ID) and also determine whether a backup tunnel intersecting a
   protected TE LSP on a downstream node (MP) already exists.

   TED on PLR will have the information of both R2 and R4, which can be
   used to find MP's TE router IP address and compute optimal backup
   path from R2 to R4, excluding link [R2->R3] and node [R3].

   Thus, RSVP-TE can signal bypass tunnel along the computed path.

   In Figure 2, cooperating PCE(s) (PCE-1 and PCE-2) have computed the
   primary LSP Path [R1->R2->R3->R4->R5] and provided to R1 (PCC).

   R2 has to build a bypass tunnel that protects against the failure of
   link [R2->R3] and node [R3].  R2 is PLR and R4 is MP.  Both PLR and
   MP are in different area.  TED on PLR doesn't have the information of
   R4.

   The problem of finding the MP address in a network with inter-domain
   TE LSP is solved by inserting a node-id sub-object [RFC4561] in the
   RRO object carried in the RSVP Path Reserve message.  PLR can find

   out the MP from the RRO it has received in Path Reserve message from
   its downstream LSR.

   But the computation of optimal backup path from R2 to R4, excluding
   link [R2->R3] and node [R3] is not possible with running of
   Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm locally at R2.  PCE
   can be used to compute backup path in this case.  R2 acting as PCC on
   PLR can request PCE-1 to compute bypass path from PLR(R2) to MP(R4),
   excluding link [R2->R3] and node [R3].  PCE MAY use inter-domain path
   computation mechanism (like HPCE ([PCE-HIERARCHY-FWK]) etc) when the
   domain information of MP is unknown at PLR.  Further, RSVP-TE can
   signal bypass tunnel along the computed path.

                  Figure 3: Node Protection for R3 (ASBR)

   In Figure 3, Links [R2->R3] and [R2->R6] are inter-AS links.  IGP
   extensions ([RFC5316] and [RFC5392]) describe the flooding of
   inter-AS TE information for inter-AS path computation.  Cooperating
   PCE(s) (PCE-1 and PCE-2) have computed the primary LSP Path
   [R1->R2->R3->R4->R5] and provided to R1 (PCC).

   R2 is PLR and R4 is MP.  Both PLR and MP are in different AS.  TED on
   PLR doesn't have the information of R4.

   The address of MP can be found using node-id sub-object [RFC4561] in
   the RRO object carried in the RSVP Path Reserve message.  And
   Cooperating PCEs could be used to compute the inter-AS bypass path.
   Thus ASBR boundary node protection is similar to ABR protection.

3.2.3.  Boundary node protection with Path-Key Confidentiality

   [RFC5520] defines a mechanism to hide the contents of a segment of a
   path, called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS).  The CPS may be
   replaced by a path-key that can be conveyed in the PCE Communication
   Protocol (PCEP) and signaled within in a Resource Reservation
   Protocol TE (RSVP-TE) explicit route object.

   [RFC5553] states that, when the signaling message crosses a domain
   boundary, the path segment that needs to be hidden (that is, a CPS)
   MAY be replaced in the RRO with a PKS.  Note that RRO in Path Reserve
   message carries the same PKS as originally signaled in the ERO of the
   Path message.

            Figure 4: Node Protection for R3 (ABR) and Path-Key

   In Figure 4, when path-key is enabled, cooperating PCE(s) (PCE-1 and
   PCE-2) have computed the primary LSP Path [R1->R2->R3->PKS->R9] and
   provided to R1 (PCC).

   When the ABR node (R3) replaces the CPS with PKS (as originally
   signaled) during the Path Reserve message handling, it MAY also add
   the immediate downstream node-id (R4) (so that the PLR (R2) can
   identify the MP (R4)).  Further the PLR (R2) SHOULD remove the MP
   node-id (R4) before sending the path reserve message upstream to head
   end router.

   Once MP is identified, the backup path computation using PCE is as
   described earlier.  (Section 3.2.1)

                  Figure 5: Node Protection for R3 (ASBR)

   The address of MP can be found using the same mechanism as explained
   above.  Thus ASBR boundary node protection is similar to ABR
   protection.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new security issues.  However, MP's
   node-id is carried as subobject in RRO across domain.  This
   relaxation is required to find MP in case of BN protection.  The
   security considerations pertaining to the [RFC3209], [RFC4090] and
   [RFC5440] protocols remain relevant.

6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
