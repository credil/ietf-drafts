Internet-Draft        The Create-Form and Edit-Form         October 2012


1.  Introduction

   RFC 5988 [RFC5988] defined the way of indicating resources on the
   Web. This specification defines link relation types which may be used
   to express the relationships between a resource and an input form for
   constructing data submissions.

   The "create-form" and "edit-form" link relations are intentionally
   generic, and they can be used with multiple media types in a wide
   variety of use cases.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Link Relations

   The following link relations are defined.

3.1.  The "create-form" Link Relation Type

   When included in a response, the "create-form" link relation
   indicates a target resource that represents a form that can be used
   to append a new member to the link context.

   <html>
     <ul>
       <li>Entry Description 1</li>
       <li>Entry Description 2</li>
     </ul>
     <a href="..." rel="create-form">[Add New Entry]</a>
   </html>

   or, expressed as a Link header

   Link: <...>; rel="create-form"; title="Add New Entry"

3.1.1.  Using the "create-form" Link Relation

   If the form representation includes a submission URI this URI MUST be
   used to submit the form.  The context URI SHOULD be used otherwise.

   If the form representation includes a submission method this method
   MUST be used for submit requests.  HTTP's POST method SHOULD be used
   otherwise.

3.2.  The "edit-form" Link Relation Type

   When included in a response, the "edit-form" link relation indicates
   a target resource that represents a form that can be used for
   updating the context resource.

   <html>
    ...
    <ul>
      <li>
        Entry Description 1
        <a href="..." rel="edit-form">[Edit Entry]</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    ...
   </html>

   or, expressed as a Link header

   Link: <...>; rel="edit-form"; title="Edit Entry"





3.2.1.  Using the "edit-form" Link Relation

   If the form representation includes a submission URI this URI MUST be
   used to submit the form.  The context URI SHOULD be used otherwise.

   If the form representation includes a submission method this method
   MUST be used for submit requests.  HTTP's PUT method SHOULD be used
   otherwise.

3.3.  Error Handling Example

   When submitting forms in unsupported media type format, service may
   respond to the client with HTTP's 415 Unsupported Media Type status
   code.

     HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
     Link: <...>; rel="create-form"; title="Create new entry"
     Content-Type: text/html
     Content-Length: ...

     <html>
       Use <a href="..." rel="create-form">
         this form
       </a> to create a new entry.
     </html>

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the "create-form" and "edit-form" link
   relations below as per [RFC5988].

4.1.  The Link Relation Registration "create-form"

   Relation Name:

      create-form

   Description:

      The target IRI points to a resource where a submission form can be
      obtained.

   Security considerations:

      Automated agents should take care when this relation crosses
      administrative domains (e.g., the URI has a different authority
      than the current document).

   Reference:

      See Section 3.

4.2.  The Link Relation Registration "edit-form"

   Relation Name:

      edit-form

   Description:

      The target IRI points to a resource where a submission form for
      editing associated resource can be obtained.

   Security Considerations:

      Automated agents should take care when this relation crosses
      administrative domains (e.g., the URI has a different authority
      than the current document).

   Reference:

      See Section 3.

5.  Security Considerations

   See Section 7 of RFC5988 [RFC5988].

6.  Internationalisation Considerations

   See Section 8 of RFC5988 [RFC5988].
