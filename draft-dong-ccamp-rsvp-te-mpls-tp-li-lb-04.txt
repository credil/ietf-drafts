Internet-Draft        RSVP-TE Extensions for LI&LB          October 2012


1.  Introduction

   The requirements for Lock Instruct (LI) and Loopback (LB) are
   specified in [RFC5860], and the framework of LI and LB is specified
   in [RFC6371].  [RFC6435] defines management plane based Lock Instruct
   (LI) and Loopback (LB) mechanisms, and an LI OAM message can be used
   for additional lock coordination between the MEPs.  Management plane
   based LI and LB is suitable for scenarios where dynamic control plane
   is not available.

   When a control plane is used for establishing MPLS-TP LSPs, it is
   natural to use and extend the control plane protocol to implement LI
   and LB functions.  Since LI and LB would modify the forwarding plane
   of an LSP, without the involvement of control plane this may result
   in inconsistency of the LSP information between control plane and
   data plane.  Besides, with control plane mechanisms, it does not need
   to rely on the TTL expiration to make the OAM requests reach
   particular MIP or MEP.

   There are some existing control plane based OAM provisioning
   mechanisms for MPLS-TP.  For example,
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-mpls-tp-oam-ext] specifies the RSVP-TE
   extensions for the configuration of proactive OAM functions for
   MPLS-TP LSPs when control plane is used.

   This document specifies extensions to RSVP-TE to implement LI and LB
   functions for MPLS-TP LSPs when MPLS-TP control plane is used.  The
   mechanisms defined in this document are complementary to [RFC6435].


2.  Extensions to RSVP-TE

   The A (Administratively down) bit in ADMIN_STATUS object [RFC3471]
   [RFC3473] is used to indicate the lock/unlock of the LSP.  Format of
   ADMIN_STATUS Object is as below:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |            Length             | Class-Num(196)|   C-Type (1)  |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |R|                        Reserved               |H|L|I|C|T|A|D|

   Reflect (R): 1 bit - see [RFC3471]
   Handover (H): 1 bit - see [RFC5852]
   Lockout (L): 1 bit - see [RFC4872]
   Inhibit Alarm Indication (I): 1 bit - see [RFC4783]
   Call Control (C): 1 bit - see [RFC4974]
   Testing (T): 1 bit - see [RFC3471]
   Administratively down (A): 1 bit - see [RFC3471], reused for Lock
   Deletion in progress (D): 1 bit - see [RFC3471]

   A new bit is defined in Attribute Flags TLV [RFC5420] to indicate the
   loopback mode.  The bit number is TBA.

Bit Number   Name and Usage
TBA          Loopback mode desired.
             This flag indicates a particular node on the LSP is required
             to enter loopback mode.
             This MAY also be used for specifying the loopback state
             of the node.


3.  Operations

3.1.  Lock Instruct

   When a MEP wants to put an LSP into lock mode, it MUST send a Path
   message with the Administratively down (A) bit and the Reflect (R)
   bit in ADMIN_STATUS Object set.  The intermediate nodes SHOULD
   forward the message with the A bit unchanged to the downstream .

   On receipt of this Path message, the receiving MEP node SHOULD try to
   take the LSP out of service.  If the receiving MEP locks the LSP
   successfully, it SHOULD send a Resv message with the A bit in
   ADMIN_STATUS object set.  Otherwise, it SHOULD send a PathErr message
   with the Error Code "OAM Problem" and the new Error Value "Lock
   Failure", and the following Resv message SHOULD be sent with the A
   bit cleared.  During this procedure, the intermediate nodes would be
   aware of whether the LSP is in Lock mode or not.

   When an LSP is put in lock mode, the subsequent Path and Resv
   messages SHOULD keep the A bit in ADMIN_STATUS Object set.

   When a MEP wants to take the LSP out of the lock mode, it MUST send a
   Path message with the A bit in ADMIN_STATUS Object cleared.  The
   intermediate nodes SHOULD forward this message with the A bit
   unchanged to the downstream.

   On receipt of this Path message, the receiving MEP node SHOULD try to
   bring the LSP back to service.  If the receiving MEP unlocks the LSP

   successfully, it SHOULD send a Resv message with the A bit in
   ADMIN_STATUS Object cleared.  Otherwise, it SHOULD send a PathErr
   message with the Error Code "OAM Problem" and the new Error Value
   "Unlock Failure", and the following Resv message SHOULD be sent with
   the A bit set.

   When an LSP is taken out of lock mode, the subsequent Path and Resv
   messages SHOULD keep the A bit in ADMIN_STATUS Object cleared.

3.2.  Loopback

   The loopback request can be sent either to the remote MEP or to a
   particular MIP node.  The mechanism defined in
   [I-D.margaria-ccamp-lsp-attribute-ero] is used for addressing the
   loopback request to a particular node on the LSP.  The loopback
   request is acceptable only when the LSP is in lock mode.

   When a MEP wants to put a particular LSR on the LSP into loopback
   mode, it MUST send a Path message with the Loopback bit in the
   Attribute Flags TLV set.  The mechansim defined in
   [I-D.margaria-ccamp-lsp-attribute-ero] is used to address the
   loopback request to the particular LSR.  The Administratively down
   (A) bit in ADMIN_STATUS object SHOLUD be set to keep the LSP in lock
   mode.

   On receipt of this Path message, the target LSR of the loopback
   request SHOULD try to put the LSP into loopback mode.  If the node
   puts the LSP into loopback mode successfully, it SHOULD set the the
   Loopback (B) Bit in the RRO Attribute subobject [RFC5420] and push
   this subobject onto the RRO object in the corresponding Resv message.
   The Administratively down (A) bit in ADMIN_STATUS object SHOULD be
   set in the Resv message.  If the node cannot put the LSP into
   loopback mode, it SHOULD send a PathErr message with the Error Code
   "OAM Problem" and the new Error Value "Loopback Failure".

   When a MEP wants to take the LSP out of loopback mode, it MUST send a
   Path message with the Loopback bit in the Attribute Flags TLV
   cleared.  The mechansim defined in
   [I-D.margaria-ccamp-lsp-attribute-ero] is used to indicate that the
   particular LSR SHOULD exit loopback mode for this LSP.  The
   Administratively down (A) bit in ADMIN_STATUS object SHOULD be set.

   On receipt of this Path message, the target node SHOULD try to take
   the LSP out of loopback mode.  If the node takes the LSP out of
   loopback mode successfully, it SHOULD clear the the Loopback (B) Bit
   in the RRO Attribute subobject and push this subobject onto the RRO
   object in the corresponding Resv message.  The Administratively down
   (A) Bit in ADMIN_STATUS Object SHOULD be set.  Otherwise, the node

   SHOULD send a PathErr message with the Error Code "OAM Problem" and
   the new Error Value "Exit Loopback Failure".


4.  IANA Considerations

   One bit number Loopback needs to be assigned in the Attribute Flags
   registry.

   Four new Error Values need to be allocated for Error Code "OAM
   Problem": "Lock Failure", "Unlock Failure", "Loopback Failure", "Exit
   Loopback Failure".


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security issues above those
   identified in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].
