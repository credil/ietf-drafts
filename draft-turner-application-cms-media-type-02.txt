Internet-Draft               CMS Media Type                 May 30, 2013


1. Introduction

   [RFC5751] registered the application/pkc7-mime media type.  That
   document defined five optional smime-type parameters.  The smime-type
   parameter originally conveyed details about the security applied
   (signed or enveloped) to the data content type, hence signed-data and
   enveloped-data, the name of the data, and was later expanded to also
   indicate that the message was compressed, compressed-data, and that
   the message is a certs-only message.  This document does not affect
   those registrations as this document places no requirements on S/MIME
   (Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) agents.

   The registration done by the S/MIME documents was done assuming that
   there would be a MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
   wrapping layer around each of the different enveloping contents, thus
   there was no need to include more than one item in each smime-type. 
   This is no longer the case with some of the more advanced enveloping
   types.  Some protocols such as the CMC (Certificate Management over
   Cryptographic Message Syntax) [RFC5273] have defined additional
   S/MIME types.  New protocols that intend to wrap MIME content should
   continue to define a smime-type string, however new protocols that
   intend to wrap non-mime types should use this mechanism instead.

   CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) [RFC5652] associates a content
   type identifier (OID) with a content; CMS content types have been
   widely used to define contents that can be enveloped using other CMS
   content types and to define enveloping content types some of which
   provide security services.  CMS protecting content types, those that
   provide security services, include: id-signedData [RFC5652], id-
   envelopedData [RFC5652], id-digestData [RFC5652], id-encryptedData
   [RFC5652], id-ct-authData [RFC5652], id-ct-authEnvelopedData
   [RFC5083], and id-ct-KP-encryptedKeyPkg [RFC6032].  CMS non-
   protecting content types, those that provide no security services but
   encapsulate other CMS content types, include: id-ct-contentInfo
   [RFC5652], id-compressedData [RFC3274], id-ct-contentCollection
   [RFC4073], and id-ct-contentWithAttrs [RFC4073].  Then, there are the
   inner most content types that include: id-data [RFC5652], id-ct-KP-
   aKeyPackage [RFC5958], id-ct-KP-sKeyPackage [RFC6031], id-ct-
   firmwarePackage [RFC4108], id-ct-firmwareLoadReceipt [RFC4108], id-
   ct-firmwareLoadError [RFC4108], id-ct-trustAnchorList [RFC5914], id-
   ct-KP-keyPackageReceipt [ID.housley-keypackage-receipt-n-error], and
   id-ct-KP-keyPackageError [ID.housley-keypackage-receipt-n-error].

   To support conveying CMS content types, this document defines a media
   type and parameters that indicate the enveloping and embedded CMS
   content types.

   New CMS content types should be affirmative in defining the string

Internet-Draft               CMS Media Type                 May 30, 2013


   that identifies the new content type and should additionally define
   if the new content type is expected to appear in the
   encapsulatedContent or innerContent field.

1.1. Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. CMS Media Type Registration Applications

   This section provides the media type registration application for the
   application/cms media type (see [RFC6838], Section 5.6).

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: cms

   Required parameters: None.

   Optional parameters:

     encapsulatedContent=y; where y is one or more CMS ECT
     (Encapsulating Content Types); multiple values are encapsulated in
     quotes and separated by a folding-whitespace comma folding-
     whitespace.  ECT values are based on content types found in
     [RFC3274], [RFC4073], [RFC5083], [RFC5652], and [RFC6032].  This
     list can later be extended see Section 3.
             authData
             compressedData
             contentCollection
             contentInfo
             contentWithAttrs
             authEnvelopedData
             encryptedKeyPkg
             digestData
             encryptedData
             envelopedData
             signedData

     innerContent=x; where x is one or more CMS ICT (Inner Content
     Types); multiple values encapsulated in quotes and are separated by
     a folding-whitespace comma folding-whitespace.  ICT values are
     based on content types found in [RFC4108], [RFC5914], [RFC5958],
     [RFC6031], and [ID.housley-keypackage-receipt-n-error].  This list
     can later be extended see Section 3.
             firmwarePackage

             firmwareLoadReceipt
             firmwareLoadError
             aKeyPackage
             sKeyPackage
             trustAnchorList
             keyPackageReceipt
             keyPackageError

     id-data [RFC5652] MUST NOT be used if it is the only inner content
     listed and the data is MIME content;  when id-data is used to
     encapsulate MIME, the media type application/pkcs7-mime media type
     defined in [RFC5751] SHOULD be used.

     The optional parameters are case-sensitive.

   Encoding considerations:

     Binary.

     [RFC5652] requires that the outer most encapsulation be
     ContentInfo.

   Security considerations:

     See [RFC3370], [RFC5652], [RFC5753], and [RFC5754] for id-
     signedData, id-envelopedData, id-digestData, id-encryptedData, id-
     ct-authData; see [RFC5958], [RFC5959], and [RFC6162] for id-ct-KP-
     aKeyPackage; see [RFC6031] and [RFC6160] for id-ct-KP- sKeyPackage;
     see [RFC6032], [RFC6033], and [RFC6161] for id-ct-KP-
     encryptedKeyPkg; see [RFC5914] for id-ct-trustAnchorList; see
     [RFC3274] for id-compressedData; see [RFC5083] and [RFC5084] for
     id-ct-authEnvelopedData; see [RFC4073] for id-ct-contentCollection
     and id-ct-contentWithAttrs; see [RFC4108] for id-ct-
     firmwarePackage, id-ct-firmwareLoadReceipt, id-ct-
     firmwareLoadError; see [ID.housley-keypackage-receipt-n-error] for
     id-ct-KP-keyPackageReceipt and id-ct-KP-keyPackageError.

   Interoperability considerations:

     See [RFC3274], [RFC4073], [RFC4108], [RFC5083], [RFC5652],
     [RFC5914], [RFC5958], [RFC6031], [RFC6032], and [ID.housley-
     keypackage-receipt-n-error].

     In all cases, CMS content types are encapsulated within ContentInfo
     structures [RFC5652]; that is the outer most enveloping structure
     is ContentInfo.

     When processing a SignedData around any of the inner content type

     validation rules MUST NOT be used.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the media type application/cms in the
   Standards tree using the applications provided in Section 2 of this
   document.

   IANA is also asked to establish two subtype registries called "CMS
   Encapsulating Content Types" and "CMS Inner Content Types".  Entries
   in these registries is by Expert Review [RFC5226].  The Expert will
   determine whether the content is an ECT or an ICT; where the rule is
   that an ICT does not encapsulate another content type while an ECT
   does encapsulate another content type.

   Initial values are as follows:

4. Security Considerations

   The security considerations apply: [RFC3274], [RFC3370], [RFC4073],
   [RFC4108], [RFC5083], [RFC5084], [RFC5652], [RFC5753], [RFC5754],
   [RFC5914], [RFC5958], [RFC5959] [RFC6031], [RFC6032], [RFC6033],
   [RFC6160], [RFC6161], [RFC6162], and [ID.housley-keypackage-receipt-
   n-error].

   In some circumstances, significant information can be leaked by
   disclosing what the innermost ASN.1 structure is.  In these cases it
   is acceptable to disclose the wrappers without disclosing the inner
   content type.
