     NADA: A Unified Congestion Control Scheme for Real-Time Media
                        draft-zhu-rmcat-nada-02


Abstract

   This document describes a scheme named network-assisted dynamic
   adaptation (NADA), a novel congestion control approach for
   interactive real-time media applications, such as video conferencing.
   In the proposed scheme, the sender regulates its sending rate based
   on either implicit or explicit congestion signaling, in a unified
   approach. The scheme can benefit from explicit congestion
   notification (ECN) markings from network nodes. It also maintains
   consistent sender behavior in the absence of such markings, by 
   reacting to queuing delays and packet losses instead.  

   We present here the overall system architecture, recommended
   behaviors at the sender and the receiver, as well as expected network
   node operations. Results from extensive simulation studies of the
   proposed scheme are available upon request.

1. Introduction

   Interactive real-time media applications introduce a unique set of
   challenges for congestion control. Unlike TCP, the mechanism used for
   real-time media needs to adapt fast to instantaneous bandwidth
   changes, accommodate fluctuations in the output of video encoder rate
   control, and cause low queuing delay over the network. An ideal
   scheme should also make effective use of all types of congestion
   signals, including packet losses, queuing delay, and explicit
   congestion notification (ECN) markings. 

   Based on the above considerations, we present a scheme named network-
   assisted dynamic adaptation (NADA). The proposed design benefits from
   explicit congestion control signals (e.g., ECN markings) from the
   network, and remains compatible in the presence of implicit signals
   (delay or loss) only. In addition, it supports weighted bandwidth
   sharing among competing video flows. 

   This documentation describes the overall system architecture,
   recommended designs at the sender and receiver, as well as expected
   network nodes operations. The signaling mechanism consists of
   standard RTP timestamp [RFC3550] and standard RTCP feedback reports. 

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3. System Model

   The system consists of the following elements: 

        * Incoming media stream, in the form of consecutive raw video
        frames and audio samples;

        * Media encoder with rate control capabilities. It takes the
        incoming media stream and encodes it to an RTP stream at a
        target bit rate R_o. Note that the actual output rate from the
        encoder R_v may fluctuate randomly around R_o. Also, the encoder
        can only change its rate at rather coarse time intervals, on the
        order of seconds. 

        * RTP sender, responsible for calculating the target bit rate
        R_o based on network congestion signals (delay or ECN marking
        reports from the receiver), and for regulating the actual
        sending rate R_s accordingly. A rate shaping buffer is employed

        to absorb the instantaneous difference between video encoder
        output rate R_v and sending rate R_s. The buffer size L_s,
        together with R_o, influences the calculation of R_s. The RTP
        sender also generates RTP timestamp in outgoing packets.

        * RTP receiver, responsible for measuring and estimating end-to-
        end delay d based on sender RTP timestamp. In the presence of
        packet losses and ECN markings, it also records the individual
        loss and marking events, and calculates the equivalent delay
        d_tilde that accounts for queuing delay, ECN marking, and packet
        losses. The receiver feeds such statistics back to the sender
        via periodic RTCP reports. 

        * Network node, with several modes of operation. The system can
        work with the default behavior of a simple drop tail queue.  It
        can also benefit from advanced AQM features such as RED-based
        ECN marking, and PCN marking using a token bucket algorithm. 

In the following, we will elaborate on the respective operations at the
network node, the receiver, and the sender.

4. Network Node Operations

We consider three variations of queue management behavior at the network
node, leading to either implicit or explicit congestion signals. 

4.1 Default behavior of drop tail

In conventional network with drop tail or RED queues, congestion is
inferred from the estimation of end-to-end delay. No special action is
required at network node.

Packet drops at the queue are detected at the receiver, and contributes
to the calculation of the equivalent delay d_tilde. 

4.2 ECN marking

In this mode, the network node randomly marks the ECN field in the IP
packet header following the Random Early Detection (RED) algorithm
[RFC2309]. Calculation of the marking probability involves the following
steps:

    * upon packet arrival, update smoothed queue size q_avg as: 

                  q_avg = alpha*q + (1-alpha)*q_avg. 

    The smoothing parameter alpha is a value between 0 and 1. A value of
    alpha=1 corresponds to performing no smoothing at all.

INTERNET DRAFT                    NADA                September 11, 2013


    * calculate marking probability p as: 

        p = 0, if q < q_lo; 

                   q_avg - q_lo
        p = p_max*--------------, if q_lo <= q < q_hi; 
                   q_hi - q_lo

        p = 1, if q >= q_hi. 

Here, q_lo and q_hi corresponds to the low and high thresholds of queue
occupancy. The maximum parking probability is p_max. 

The ECN markings events will contribute to the calculation of an
equivalent delay d_tilde at the receiver. No changes are required at the
sender.

4.3 PCN marking

As a more advanced feature, we also envision network nodes which support
PCN marking based on virtual queues. In such a case, the marking
probability of the ECN bit in the IP packet header is calculated as
follows:

    * upon packet arrival, meter packet against token bucket (r,b); 

    * update token level b_tk; 

    * calculate the marking probability as: 

        p = 0, if b-b_tk < b_lo; 

                    b-b_tk-b_lo
        p = p_max* --------------, if b_lo<= b-b_tk <b_hi; 
                     b_hi-b_lo

        p = 1, if b-b_tk>=b_hi. 

Here, the token bucket lower and upper limits are denoted by b_lo and
b_hi, respectively. The parameter b indicates the size of the token
bucket. The parameter r is chosen as r=gamma*C, where gamma<1 is the
target utilization ratio and C designates link capacity. The maximum
marking probability is p_max. 

The ECN markings events will contribute to the calculation of an
equivalent delay d_tilde at the receiver. No changes are required at the
sender. The virtual queuing mechanism from the PCN marking algorithm
will lead to additional benefits such as zero standing queues.

4.4 Comments and Discussions

In all three flavors described above, the network queue operates with
the simple first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle. There is no need to
maintain per-flow state. Such a simple design ensures that the system
can scale easily with large number of video flows and high link
capacity.

The sender behavior stays the same in the presence of all types of
congestion signals: delay, loss, ECN marking due to either RED/ECN or
PCN algorithms. This unified approach allows a graceful transition of
the scheme as the level of congestion in the network shifts dynamically
between different regimes. 

5. Receiver Behavior

The role of the receiver is fairly straightforward. It is in charge of
four steps: a) monitoring end-to-end delay/loss/marking statistics on a
per-packet basis; b) aggregating all forms of congestion signals in
terms of the equivalent delay; c) calculating time-smoothed value of the
congestion signal; and d) sending periodic reports back to the sender. 

5.1 Monitoring per-packet statistics

The receiver observes and estimates one-way delay d_n for the n-th
packet, ECN marking event 1_M, and packet loss event 1_L. Here, 1_M and
1_L are binary indicators: the value of 1 corresponding to a marked or
lost packet and value of 0 indicates no marking or loss. 

The equivalent delay d_tilde is calculated as follows: 

                  d_tilde = d_n + 1_M d_M + 1_M d_L, 

where d_M is a prescribed fictitious delay value corresponding to the
ECN marking event (e.g., d_M = 200 ms), and d_L is a prescribed
fictitious delay value corresponding to the packet loss event (e.g., d_L
= 1 second). By introducing a large fictitious delay penalty for ECN
marking and packet losses, our proposed scheme leads to low end-to-end
actual delays in the presence of such events. 


5.2 Calculating time-smoothed values

The receiver smoothes its observations via  exponential averaging: 

                 x_n = alpha*d_tilde + (1-alpha)*x_n. 

The weighting parameter alpha adjusts the level of smoothing.

5.3 Sending periodic feedback 

Periodically, the receiver sends back the updated value of x in RTCP
messages, to aid the sender in its calculation of target rate.  The size
of acknowledgement packets are typically on the order of tens of bytes,
and are significantly smaller than average video packet sizes.
Therefore, the bandwidth overhead of the receiver acknowledgement stream
is sufficiently low.

    Figure 1 provides a more detailed view of the NADA sender. Upon
    receipt of an RTCP report from the receiver, the NADA sender updates
    its calculation of the reference rate R_n as a function of the
    network congestion signal. It further adjusts both the target rate
    for the live video encoder R_v and the sending rate R_s over the
    network based on the updated value of R_n, as well as the size of
    the rate shaping buffer.


    The following sections describe these modules in further details,
    and explain how they interact with each other.  



6.1 Video encoder rate control

The video encoder rate control procedure has the following
characteristics:

    * Rate changes can happen only at large intervals, on the order of
    seconds.

    * Given a target rate R_o, the encoder output rate may randomly
    fluctuate around it. 

    * The encoder output rate is further constrained by video content
    complexity. The range of the final rate output is [R_min, R_max].
    Note that it's content-dependent, and may change over time.

Note that operation of the live video encoder is out of the scope of our
design for a congestion control scheme in NADA. Instead, its behavior
treated as a black box. 

6.2 Rate shaping buffer

A rate shaping buffer is employed to absorb any instantaneous mismatch
between encoder rate output R_o and regulated sending rate R_s. The size
of the buffer evolves from time t-tau to time t as: 

             L_s(t) = max [0, L_s(t-tau)+R_v*tau-R_s*tau]. 


A large rate shaping buffer contributes to higher end-to-end delay,
which may harm the performance of real-time media communications.
Therefore, the sender has a strong incentive to constrain the size of
the shaping buffer. It can either deplete it faster by increasing the
sending rate R_s, or limit its growth by reducing the target rate for
the video encoder rate control R_v.

6.3 Reference rate calculator

The sender calculates the reference rate R_n based on network congestion
information from receiver RTCP reports. It first compensates the effect
of delayed observation by one round-trip time (RTT) via a linear
predictor:


                        x_n - x_n-1          
        x_hat = x_n + ---------------*tau_o       (1)
                            delta


In (1), the arrival interval between the (n-1)-th the n-th packets is
designated by delta. The parameter tau_o indicates the reference round-
trip-time, hence the prediction step size. 

The reference rate is then calculated as: 


                          R_max-R_min           
        R_n = R_min + w*---------------*x_ref     (2) 
                            x_hat


Here, R_min and R_max denote the content-dependent rate range the
encoder can produce. The weight of priority level is w. The reference
congestion signal x_ref is chosen so that the maximum rate of R_max can
be achieved when x_hat = w*x_ref. Note that the combination of w and
x_ref determines how sensitive the rate adaptation scheme is in reaction
to fluctuations in observed signal x. The final target rate R_o is
clipped within the range of [R_min, R_max].

Note that the sender does not need any explicit knowledge of the
management scheme inside the network. Rather, it reacts to the
aggregation of all forms of congestion indications (delay, loss, and
marking) via the composite congestion signal x_n from the receiver in a
coherent manner. 


6.4 Video target rate and sending rate calculator

The target rate for the live video encoder is updated based on both the
reference rate R_n and the rate shaping buffer size L_s, as follows:

                               L_s
        R_v = R_o - beta_v * -------.       (3) 
                              tau_v

Similarly, the outgoing rate is regulated based on both the reference
rate R_n and the rate shaping buffer size L_s, such that:

                               L_s
        R_s = R_o + beta_s * -------.       (4) 
                              tau_v

In (3) and (4), the first term indicates the rate calculated from
network congestion feedback alone. The second term indicates the
influence of the rate shaping buffer. A large rate shaping buffer nudges
the encoder target rate slightly below -- and the sending rate slightly
above -- the reference rate R_n. Intuitively, the amount of extra rate
offset needed to completely drain the rate shaping buffer within the
same time frame of encoder rate adaptation tau_v is given by L_s/tau_v.
The scaling parameters beta_v and beta_s can be tuned to balance between
the competing goals of maintaining a small rate shaping buffer and
deviating the system from the reference rate point.


6.5 Slow-start behavior

Finally, special care needs to be taken during the startup phase of a
video stream, since it may take several roundtrip-times before the
sender can collect statistically robust information on network
congestion. We propose to regulate the reference rate R_n to grow
linearly in the beginning, no more than: R_ss at time t:

                           t-t_0
        R_ss(t) = R_min + -------(R_max-R_min).
                             T

The start time of the stream is t_0, and T represents the time horizon
over which the slow-start mechanism is effective. The encoder target
rate is chosen to be the minimum of R_n and R_ss during the first T
seconds.


7. Incremental Deployment

One nice property of proposed design is the consistent video end point
behavior irrespective of network node variations. This facilitates
gradual, incremental adoption of the scheme. 

To start off with, the proposed encoder congestion control mechanism can
be implemented without any explicit support from the network, and rely
solely on observed one-way delay measurements and packet loss ratios as
implicit congestion signals.

When ECN is enabled at the network nodes with RED-based marking, the
receiver can fold its observations of ECN markings into the calculation
of the equivalent delay. The sender can react to these explicit
congestion signals without any modification.

Ultimately, networks equipped with proactive marking based on token
bucket level metering can reap the additional benefits of zero standing
queues and lower end-to-end delay and work seamlessly with existing
senders and receivers. 

8. Implementation Status

The proposed NADA scheme has been implemented in the ns-2 simulation
platform [ns2]. Extensive simulation evaluations of the scheme are
documented in [Zhu-PV13]. 

A Linux-based testbed implementation is currently underway.  

9. IANA Considerations

There are no actions for IANA.
