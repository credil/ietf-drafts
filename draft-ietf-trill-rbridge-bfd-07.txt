1. Introduction

   Faster convergence is a critical feature of TRILL (Transparent
   Interconnection of Lots of Links [RFC6325]) networks.  The TRILL IS-
   IS Hellos [RFC6327] [IS-IS] used between RBridges provide a basic
   neighbor and continuity check for TRILL links.  However, failure
   detection by non- receipt of such Hellos is based on the holding time
   parameter that is commonly set to a value of tens of seconds and, in
   any case, has a minimum expressible value of one second.

   Some applications, including voice over IP, may wish, with high
   probability, to detect interruptions in continuity within a much
   shorter time period.  In some cases physical layer failures can be
   detected very rapidly but this is not always possible, such as when
   there is a failure between two bridges that are in turn between two
   RBridges.  There are also many subtle failures possible at higher
   levels.  For example, some forms of failure could affect unicast
   frames while still letting multicast frames through; since all TRILL
   IS-IS Hellos are multicast such a failure cannot be detected with
   Hellos.  Thus, a low overhead method for frequently testing
   continuity for the TRILL Data between neighbor RBridges is necessary
   for some applications.  The BFD (Bi-directional Forwarding Detection
   [RFC5880]) protocol provides a low-overhead method for the rapid
   detection of connectivity failures.

   BFD is a widely deployed OAM (Operations, Administration, and
   Maintenance, [RFC6291]) mechanism in IP and MPLS (Multi Protocol
   Label Switching) networks, using UDP and ACH (Associated Channel
   Header) encapsulation respectively. This document describes a TRILL
   encapsulation for BFD packets for networks that forward based on the
   TRILL Header.




1.1 Terminology

   This document uses the acronyms defined in [RFC6325] along with the
   following:

      BFD: Bi-directional Forwarding Detection

      IP: Internet Protocol

      IS-IS: Intermediate-System to Intermediate-System

      MH: Multi-Hop

      PPP: Point-to-Point Protocol

2.  BFD over TRILL

   TRILL supports unicast neighbor BFD Echo and one-hop and multi-hop
   BFD Control, as specified below, over the Rbridge Channel facility
   [TRILLChannel].  (Multi-destination BFD is a work in progress
   [MultiBFD].) BFD over TRILL support is similar to BFD over IP support
   [RFC5881] except where differences are explicitly mentioned.

   Asynchronous and demand modes MUST BE supported [RFC5880].  BFD over
   TRILL supports the Echo function, however implementation of TRILL BFD
   Echo is optional and it can only be used for single-hop sessions.

   The TRILL Header hop count in the BFD packets is sent out with the
   maximum value of 0x3F.  To prevent spoofing attacks, the TRILL hop
   count of a received session is checked [RFC5082].  For a single-hop
   session if the hop count is less than 0x3F and the Rbridge Channel
   Header MH flag is zero, the packet is discarded.  For multihop
   sessions the hop count check can be disabled if the MH flag is one.

   As in BFD for IP the format of the Echo Packet content is not
   defined.

   New Rbridge Channel code points for BFD TRILL Control and BFD Echo
   packets are specified.

   Authentication mechanisms as supported in BFD are also supported for
   BFD running over TRILL.




2.1 Sessions and Initialization

   Within an RBridge campus, there will be no more than one TRILL BFD
   Control session from any RBridge RB1 to RBridge RB2 for each RB1
   TRILL port.  This BFD session must be bound to this interface.  As
   such, both sides of a session MUST take the "Active" role (sending
   initial BFD Control packets with a zero value of Your Discriminator),
   and any BFD packet from the remote machine with a zero value of Your
   Discriminator MUST be associated with the session bound to the remote
   system and interface.

   Note that TRILL BFD provides OAM facilities for the TRILL data plane.
   This is above whatever protocol is in use on a particular link, such
   as a PPP [RFC6361] link or an Ethernet link [RFC6325].  Link
   technology specific OAM protocols may be used on a link between
   neighbor RBridges, for example Continuity Fault Management [802.1Q]
   if the link is Ethernet.  But such link layer OAM and coordination
   between it and TRILL data plane layer OAM, such as TRILL BFD, is
   beyond the scope of this document.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                   BFD TRILL Encapsulation


   If lower level mechanisms, such as link aggregation [802.1AX], are in
   use that present a single logical interface to TRILL IS-IS, only a
   single TRILL BFD session can be established to any other RBridge over
   this logical interface.  However, lower layer OAM could be aware of
   and/or run separately on each of the components of an aggregation.

3. TRILL BFD Control Protocol

   TRILL BFD Control frames are unicast TRILL Rbridge Channel frames
   [TRILLChannel].  The Rbridge Channel Protocol value is given in
   Section 8. The protocol specific data associated with the TRILL BFD
   Control protocol is as shown in Section 4.1 of [RFC5880].




3.1 One-Hop TRILL BFD Control

   One-hop TRILL BFD Control is typically used to rapidly detect link
   and RBridge failures.  TRILL BFD frames over one hop for such
   purposes SHOULD be sent with high priority; that is, the Inner.VLAN
   tag priority should be 7, they should be queued for transmission as
   maximum priority frames and, if they are being sent on an Ethernet
   link where the output port is configured to include an Outer.VLAN
   tag, that tag should specify priority 7.

   For neighbor RBridges RB1 and RB2, each RBridge sends one-hop TRILL
   BFD Control frames to the other only if TRILL IS-IS has detected bi-
   directional connectivity, that is, the adjacency is in the Two-Way or
   Report state [RFC6327] and both RBridges indicate support of TRILL
   BFD is enabled.  The BFD Enabled TLV is used to indicate this as
   specified in [RFC6213].




3.2 BFD Control Frame Processing

   The following tests SHOULD be performed on received TRILL BFD Control
   frames before generic BFD processing.

   Is the M-bit in the TRILL Header non-zero?  If so, discard the frame.
   (Multi-destination BFD is a work in progress [MultiBFD].)  Failure to
   perform this test would make a denial-of-service attack using bogus
   multi-destination BFD Control frames easier.

   If the Channel Header MH flag is zero, indicating one-hop, test that
   the TRILL Header hop count received was 0x3F (i.e., is 0x3E if it has
   already been decremented) and if it is any other value discard the
   frame.  If the MH Channel flag is one, indicating multi-hop, test
   that the TRILL Header hop count received was not less than a
   configurable value that defaults to 0x30.  If it is less, discard the
   frame.  Failure to perform these tests would make it easier to spoof
   BFD Control frames. However, if forged BFD Control frames are a
   concern, then BFD Authentication [RFC5880] should be used.

4. TRILL BFD Echo Protocol

   A TRILL BFD Echo frame is a unicast Rbridge Channel frame, as
   specified in [TRILLChannel], which should be forwarded back by an
   immediate neighbor because both the ingress and egress nicknames are
   set to a nickname of the originating RBridge.  Normal TRILL Data
   frame forwarding will cause the frame to be returned unless micro-
   loop suppression logic in the neighbor RBrdge prohibits sending a
   frame back out the port on which it was received or the like.
   RBridges with such prohibitions cannot support BFD Echo.  The TRILL
   OAM protocol number for BFD Echo is given in Section 8.

   TRILL BFD Echo frames SHOULD be sent on a link only if the following
   conditions are met. An Echo originated under other circumstances will
   consume bandwidth and CPU resources but is unlikely to be returned.

    - A TRILL BFD Control session has been established,

    - TRILL BFD Echo support is indicated by the potentially echo
      responding RBridge,

    - The adjacency is in the Report state [RFC6327], and

    - The TRILL BFD Echo originating RBridge wishes to make use of this
      optional feature.

   Since the originating RBridge is the RBridge that will be processing
   a returned Echo frame, the entire TRILL BFD Echo protocol specific
   data area is considered opaque and left to the discretion of the
   originating RBridge.  Nevertheless, it is suggested that this data
   include information by which the originating RBridge can authenticate
   the returned BFD Echo frame and confirm the neighbor that echoed the
   frame back.  For example, it could include its own SystemID, the
   neighbor's SystemID, a session identifier and a sequence count as
   well as a Message Authentication Code.




4.1  BFD Echo Frame Processing

   The following tests MUST be performed on returned TRILL BFD Echo
   frames before other processing.  The RBridge Channel document
   requires that the information in the TRILL Header be given to the BFD
   protocol.

   Is the M-bit in the TRILL Header non-zero?  If so, discard the frame.
   (Multi-destination BFD is a work in progress [MultiBFD].)

   The TRILL BFD Echo frame should have gone exactly two hops so test

INTERNET-DRAFT                                   BFD TRILL Encapsulation


   that the TRILL Header hop count as received was 0x3E (i.e., 0x3D if
   it has already been decremented) and if it is any other value discard
   the frame.  The Rbridge Channel Header in the frame MUST have the MH
   bit equal to one and if it is zero, the frame is discarded.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                   BFD TRILL Encapsulation


5. Management and Operations Considerations

   The TRILL BFD parameters on an RBridge are configurable.  The default
   values are the same as in the IP BFD case [RFC5881], except where
   specified in this document such as for Hop Count.

   It is up to the operator of an RBridge campus to configure the rates
   at which TRILL BFD frames are transmitted on a link to avoid
   congestion (e.g., link, I/O, CPU) and false failure detection. See
   also the discussion of congestion in Section 2 of [RFC5881].

   As stated in [RFC5880]:
      It is worth noting that a single BFD session does not consume a
      large amount of bandwidth.  An aggressive session that achieves a
      detection time of 50 milliseconds, by using a transmit interval of
      16.7 milliseconds and a detect multiplier of 3, will generate 60
      packets per second.  The maximum length of each packet on the wire
      is on the order of 100 bytes, for a total of around 48 kilobits
      per second of bandwidth consumption in each direction.

6. Default Authentication

   Consistent with TRILL's goal of being able to operate with minimum
   configuration, the default for BFD authentication between neighbor
   RBridges is based on the state of IS-IS shared secret authentication
   for Hellos between those RBridges as detaled below. The BFD
   authentication algorithm and methods in this section MUST be
   implemented at an RBridge if TRILL IS-IS authentication and BFD are
   implemented at that RBrdge. If such BFD authentication is configured
   then its configuration is not restricted by the configuration of IS-
   IS security.

   If IS-IS authentication is not in effect between neighbor RBridges
   then, by default, TRILL BFD between those RBridges is also unsecured.

   If such IS-IS authentication is in effect then, unless configured
   otherwise, TRILL BFD Control frames sent between those RBridges MUST
   use BFD Meticulous Keyed SHA1 authentication [RFC5880].  The BFD
   authentication keys between neighbor RBridges by default are derived
   from the IS-IS shared secret authentication keys for Hellos between
   those RBridges as detailed below. However, such BFD authentication
   keys MAY be configured to some other value.

     HMAC-SHA256 ( ( "TRILL BFD Control" | originPortID | originSysID ),
                   IS-IS-shared-key )

   In the above "|" indicates concatenation, HMAC-SHA256 is as described
   in [FIPS180] [RFC6234], "TRILL BFD Control" is the seventeen byte US
   ASCII [ASCII] string indicated that is then concatenated with the
   2-byte Port ID of the originating port and the 6-bytes IS-IS SystemID
   of the originating RBridge, the last two items being in network byte
   order.  The Port and System IDs are included to minimize exposure of
   the same key to improve resistance to cryptanalysis. IS-IS-shared-key
   is secret keying material being used for IS-IS authentication on the
   link.

   The use of the above derived key is accomplished by associating the
   above default authentication type and key with the Key ID of the IS-
   IS-shared key used in the derivation and then using that Key ID in
   the Authentication Section of the BFD Control frame OAM protocol
   specific data. Also Auth Type would be 5 and Auth Len would be 28 in
   the Authentication Section. RBridges MAY be configured to use other
   BFD security modes or keying material or configured to use no
   security.

   Authentication for TRILL BFD Echo is a local implementation issue as
   BFD Echo frames are authenticated by their sender when returned by by
   a neighbor. However, if TRILL IS-IS and BFD Control are being
   authenticated to a neighbor and BFD Echo is in use, BFD Echo frames
   to be returned by that neighbor should be authenticated and such

INTERNET-DRAFT                                   BFD TRILL Encapsulation


   authentication should use different keying material from other types
   of authentication.  For example, it could use keying material derived
   as follows, where "|" indicates concatenation:

     HMAC-SHA256 ( ( "TRILL BFD Echo" | originPortID | originSysID ),
                   IS-IS-shared-key )

7. Security Considerations

   BFD over TRILL utilizes the RBridge Channel extension to the TRILL
   protocol and is generally analogous to BFD over IP. As such, the BFD
   authentication faciliity is available to authenticate BFD over TRILL
   packet payloads but no encryption or other security features are
   provided at the BFD over TRILL level. See the following:

      -  [RFC5881] for general BFD security considerations,

      -  [TRILLChannel] for general RBridge Channel security
         considerations, and

      -  [RFC6325] for general TRILL protocol security considerations.

   Section 3.2 above describes seurity concerns with multi-hop BFD
   Control packets and failure to check the TRILL Header M bit in BFD
   Control packets.

Recent Changes Record

   [RFC Editor Note: Please delete this section before publication.]

   From -06 to -07:

    1. Replace normative reference to RFC 20 with a refernce to [ASCII].

    2. Update Author Address information.

    3. In the default BFD authentication key derivation, change
       "OriginatorMAC" to the concatenation of the Port ID and the
       System ID.  OriginatorMAC is simpler and shorter but only works
       for Ethernet links. TRILL supports arbitrary technology links
       between RBridges so you need to use the combination of Port ID
       and System ID to get a globally unique quantity. In addition, if
       an IS-IS authentication method is in use the has a Key ID field
       so that multiple shared secret keys may be in place, then by
       default BFD authentication with such a Key ID field should also
       be used with matching Key ID for matching derived key.

    4. Clarify what it means that a single hop BFD control frame in
       support of link connectivity is send at high priority for cases
       other than Ethernet links.

    5. Add reference in Section 5 to Section 2 of [RFC5881] in
       conngection with congestion control.

    6. Add mandatory to implement support for Demand Mode BFD.

    7. Clarify that the BFD authentication algorithm and methods in
       Section 6 MUST be implemented if TRILL IS-IS Authentication and
       BFD are implemented.

    8. Add some small pieces of explanatory and motivational text that
       make no technical changes, as suggested by the Operations
       Directorate review.

    9. Delete comparison between RBridge Channel and MPLS Generic
       Associated Channel.

   10. Update Author Info.

   11. Various editorial changes.
