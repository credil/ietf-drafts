    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 3723 specifies IPsec requirements for block storage protocols
      over IP (e.g., iSCSI) based on IPsec v2 (RFC 2401 and related RFCs);
      those requirements have subsequently been applied to remote direct data
      placement protocols, e.g., RDMAP. This document updates RFC 3723's IPsec
      requirements to IPsec v3 (RFC 4301 and related RFCs) and makes some
      changes to required algorithms based on developments in cryptography
      since RFC 3723 was published.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>RFC 3723 <xref target="RFC3723"/> specifies IPsec requirements for
      block storage protocols over IP (e.g., iSCSI <xref target="RFC3720"/>)
      based on IPsec v2 (RFC 2401 <xref target="RFC2401"/> and related RFCs);
      those requirements have subsequently been applied to remote direct data
      placement protocols, e.g., RDMAP <xref target="RFC5040"/>. This document
      updates RFC 3723's IPsec requirements to IPsec v3 (<xref
      target="RFC4301"/> and related RFCs) to reflect developments since RFC
      3723 was published.</t>

      <t>For brevity, this document uses the term "block storage protocols" to
      refer to all protocols to which RFC 3723's requirements (as updated by
      the requirements in this document) are applicable.</t>

      <t>In addition to the IPsec v2 requirements in RFC 3723, IPsec v3, as
      specified in <xref target="RFC4301"/> and related RFCs (e.g., IKEv2
      <xref target="RFC5996"/>), SHOULD be implemented for block storage
      protocols. Retention of the mandatory requirement for IPsec v2 provides
      interoperability with existing implementations, and the strong
      recommendation for IPsec v3 encourages implementers to move forward to
      that newer version of IPsec.</t>

      <t>Cryptographic developments since the publication of RFC 3723
      necessitate changes to the encryption transform requirements for IPsec
      v2, as explained further in <xref target="Conf-xform"/>; these updated
      requirements also apply to IPsec v3.</t>

      <t>Block storage protocols can be expected to operate at high data rates
      (multiple Gigabits/second). The cryptographic requirements in this
      document are strongly influenced by that expectation; an important
      example is that 3DES CBC is no longer recommended for block storage
      protocols due to the frequent rekeying impacts of 3DES's 64-bit block
      size at high data rates.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

      <section title="Summary of Changes to RFC 3723">
        <t>This document makes the following changes to RFC 3723:<list
            style="symbols">
            <t>Adds requirements that IPsec v3 SHOULD be implemented (ESPv3
            and IKEv2) in addition to IPsec v2, (see <xref target="intro"/>).
            The ESPv3 implementation requirement includes extended sequence
            numbers, see <xref target="ESP-reqts"/>.</t>

            <t>Clarifies key size requirements for AES CBC MAC with XCBC
            extensions (MUST implement 128 bit keys, see <xref
            target="Auth-xform"/>).</t>

            <t>Adds IPsec v3 requirements for AES GMAC and GCM (SHOULD
            implement when IKEv2 is supported, see <xref target="Auth-xform"/>
            and <xref target="Conf-xform"/>).</t>

            <t>Removes implementation requirements for 3DES CBC and AES CTR
            (changes requirements for both to "MAY implement"). Adds a "MUST
            implement" requirement for AES CBC (see <xref
            target="Conf-xform"/>).</t>

            <t>Adds specific IKEv2 implementation requirements (see <xref
            target="IKE-reqts"/>).</t>

            <t>Removes the requirement that IKEv1 use UDP port 500, and
            changes the Diffie-Hellman group size recommendation to a minimum
            of 2048 bits (see <xref target="IKE-reqts"/>).</t>

      <section title="Other Updated RFCs">
        <t>RFC 3723's IPsec requirements have been applied to a number of
        protocols. For that reason, in addition to updating RFC 3723's IPsec
        requirements, this document also updates the IPsec requirements for
        each protocol that uses RFC 3723, i.e., the following RFCs are updated
        - in each case, the update is solely to the IPsec requirements:</t>

        <t>For brevity, this document uses the term "block storage protocols"
        to refer to all of the above protocols (and any future protocols) to
        which RFC 3723's requirements (as updated by the requirements in this
        document) are applicable.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="ESP-reqts" title="ESP  Requirements">
      <t>RFC 3723 requires that implementations MUST support IPsec ESPv2 <xref
      target="RFC2406"/> in tunnel mode as part of IPsec v2 to provide
      security for both control packets and data packets, and that when ESPv2
      is utilized, per-packet data origin authentication, integrity and replay
      protection MUST be provided.</t>

      <t>This document modifies RFC 3723 to require that implementations
      SHOULD also support IPsec ESPv3 <xref target="RFC4303"/> in tunnel mode
      as part of IPsec v3 to provide security for both control packets and
      data packets; per-packet data origin authentication, integrity and
      replay protection MUST be provided when ESPv3 is utilized.</t>

      <t>At the high speeds at which block storage protocols are expected to
      operate, a single IPsec SA could rapidly cycle through the ESP 32-bit
      sequence number space. In view of this, implementations that are capable
      of operating at speeds of 1 gigabit/second or higher and that implement
      both IKEv2 <xref target="RFC5996"/> and ESPv3 <xref target="RFC4303"/>
      MUST also implement extended (64-bit) sequence numbers for ESPv3 and
      SHOULD use ESPv3 extended sequence numbers for all block storage
      protocol traffic.</t>

      <section anchor="Auth-xform"
               title="Data Origin Authentication and Data Integrity Transforms">
        <t>RFC 3723 requires that:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>HMAC-SHA1 MUST be implemented in the form of HMAC-SHA-1-96
            <xref target="RFC2404"/>.</t>

            <t>AES CBC MAC with XCBC extensions SHOULD be implemented <xref
            target="RFC3566"/>.</t>
          </list>This document clarifies RFC 3723's key size requirements for
        implementations of AES CBC MAC with XCBC extensions; 128-bit keys MUST
        be supported, and other key sizes MAY also be supported.</t>

        <t>This document also adds a requirement for IPsec v3:<list
            style="symbols">
            <t>Implementations that support IKEv2 <xref target="RFC5996"/>
            SHOULD also implement AES GMAC <xref target="RFC4543"/>. AES GMAC
            implementations MUST support 128-bit keys, and MAY support other
            key sizes.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The rationale for the added requirement is that GMAC is more
        amenable to hardware implementations that may be preferable for the
        high data rates at which block storage protocols can be expected to
        operate.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Conf-xform"
               title="Confidentiality Transform Requirements">
        <t>RFC 3723 requires that:<list style="symbols">
            <t>3DES in CBC mode (3DES CBC) <xref target="RFC2451"/>, <xref
            target="triple-des-spec"/> MUST be supported.</t>

            <t>AES in Counter mode (AES CTR) <xref target="RFC3686"/>, SHOULD
            be supported.</t>

            <t>NULL encryption <xref target="RFC2410"/> MUST be supported.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The 3DES CBC and AES CTR requirements are replaced by requirements
        that both MAY be implemented. The NULL encryption requirement is not
        changed by this document. The 3DES CBC requirement matched the basic
        encryption interoperability requirement for IPsec v2. At the time of
        RFC 3723's publication, AES Counter mode was the encryption transform
        that was most amenable to hardware implementation, as hardware
        implementation may be preferable for the high data rates at which
        block storage protocols can be expected to operate. This document
        changes both of these requirements based on cryptographic developments
        since the publication of RFC 3723.</t>

        <t>The requirement for 3DES CBC has become problematic due to 3DES's
        64-bit block size, i.e., the core cipher encrypts or decrypts 64 bits
        at a time. Security weaknesses in encryption start to appear as the
        amount of data encrypted under a single key approaches the birthday
        bound of 32GiB for a cipher with a 64-bit block size, see <xref
        target="birthday-bound"/> and <xref target="triple-des-birthday"/>. It
        is prudent to rekey well before that bound is reached, and 32GiB or
        some significant fraction thereof is less than the amount of data that
        a block storage protocol may transfer in a single session. This may
        require frequent rekeying, e.g., to obtain an order of magnitude (10x)
        safety margin by rekeying after 3GiB on a multi-gigabit/sec link. In
        contrast, AES has a 128 bit block size, which results in a much larger
        birthday bound (2^68 bytes), see <xref target="birthday-bound"/>. AES
        CBC is the primary mandatory-to-implement encryption transform for
        interoperability, and hence is the appropriate mandatory-to-implement
        transform replacement for 3DES CBC.</t>

        <t>AES Counter mode is no longer the encryption transform that is most
        amenable to hardware implementation. That characterization now applies
        to AES Galois Counter Mode (GCM) <xref target="RFC4106"/>, which
        provides both encryption and integrity protection in a single
        cryptographic mechanism (in contrast, neither HMAC-SHA1 nor AES CBC
        MAC with XCBC extensions is well suited for hardware implementation,
        as both transforms do not pipeline well). AES GCM is also capable of
        providing confidentiality protection for the IKEv2 key exchange
        protocol, but not the IKEv1 protocol <xref target="RFC5282"/>, and
        therefore the new AES GCM "SHOULD" requirement is based on presence of
        support for IKEv2.</t>

        <t>For the reasons described in the preceding paragraphs, the
        confidentiality transform requirements in RFC 3723 are replaced by the
        following:<list style="symbols">
            <t>3DES in CBC mode MAY be implemented (replaces RFC 3723's "MUST
            implement" requirement) .</t>

            <t>AES in Counter mode MAY be implemented (replaces RFC 3723's
            "SHOULD implement" requirement).</t>

            <t>AES in CBC mode MUST be implemented. AES CBC implementations
            MUST support 128-bit keys and MAY support other key sizes.</t>

            <t>Implementations that support IKEv2 SHOULD also implement AES
            GCM. AES GCM implementations MUST support 128-bit keys, and MAY
            support other key sizes.</t>

            <t>NULL encryption <xref target="RFC2410"/> MUST be supported.</t>
          </list>The requirement for support of NULL encryption enables use of
        SAs that provide data origin authentication and data integrity, but
        not confidentiality.</t>

        <t>Other transforms MAY be implemented in addition to those listed
        above.</t>

    <section anchor="IKE-reqts" title="IKEv1 and IKEv2 Requirements">
      <t>Note: to avoid ambiguity, the original IKE protocol <xref
      target="RFC2409"/> is referred to as "IKEv1" in this document.</t>

      <t>This document adds requirements for IKEv2 usage with block Storage
      protocols and makes the following two changes to the IKEv1 requirements
      in RFC 3723 (the new D-H group requirement also applies to IKEv2):</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>When D-H groups are used, a D-H group of at least 2048 bits
          SHOULD be offered as a part of all proposals to create IPsec
          Security Associations. Use of 1024 bit D-H groups with 3DES CBC and
          HMAC-SHA1 is no longer recommended, and</t>

          <t>The requirement to use UDP port 500 is removed in order to allow
          NAT traversal <xref target="RFC3947"/>.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>There are no other changes to RFC 3723's IKEv1 requirements, but many
      of them are restated in this document in order to provide context for
      the new IKEv2 requirements.</t>

      <t>RFC 3723 requires that IKEv1 <xref target="RFC2409"/> be supported
      for peer authentication, negotiation of security associations, and key
      management, using the IPsec DOI <xref target="RFC2407"/>, and further
      requires that manual keying not be used since it does not provide the
      rekeying support necessary for operation at high data rates. This
      document adds a requirement that IKEv2 <xref target="RFC5996"/> SHOULD
      be supported for peer authentication, negotiation of security
      associations, and key management. The manual keying prohibition in RFC
      3723 is extended to IKEv2; manual keying MUST NOT be used with any
      version of IPsec for protocols to which the requirements in this
      document apply.</t>

      <t>RFC 3723's requirements for IKEv1 mode implementation and usage are
      unchanged; this document does not extend those requirements to IKEv2
      because IKEv2 does not have modes.</t>

      <t>When IPsec is used, the receipt of an IKEv1 Phase 2 delete message or
      an IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL exchange that deletes the SA SHOULD NOT be
      interpreted as a reason for tearing down the block storage protocol
      connection (e.g., TCP-based). If additional traffic is sent, a new SA
      will be created to protect that traffic.</t>

      <t>The method used to determine whether a block storage protocol
      connection should be established using IPsec is regarded as an issue of
      IPsec policy administration, and thus is not defined in this document.
      The method used by an implementation that supports both IPsec v2 and v3
      to determine which versions of IPsec are supported by the a block
      storage protocol peer is also regarded as an issue of IPsec policy
      administration, and thus is also not defined in this document. If both
      IPsec v2 and v3 are supported by both endpoints of a block storage
      protocol connection, use of IPsec v3 is recommended.</t>

      <section title="Authentication Requirements">
        <t>The authentication requirements for IKEv1 are unchanged by this
        document, but are restated here for context along with the
        authentication requirements for IKEv2:</t>

        <t><list style="letters">
            <t>Peer authentication using a pre-shared cryptographic key MUST

            peer authentication using the public key encryption methods
            specified in sections 5.2 and 5.3 of <xref target="RFC2409"/>
            SHOULD NOT be used.</t>

            <t>When digital signatures are used for authentication, all IKEv1
            and IKEv2 negotiators SHOULD use Certificate Request Payload(s) to
            specify the certificate authority, and SHOULD check the pertinent
            Certificate Revocation List (CRL) before accepting a PKI
            certificate for use in authentication.</t>

            <t>IKEv1 implementations MUST support Main Mode and SHOULD support
            Aggressive Mode. Main Mode with pre-shared key authentication
            method SHOULD NOT be used when either the initiator or the target
            uses dynamically assigned IP addresses. While in many cases
            pre-shared keys offer good security, situations in which
            dynamically assigned addresses are used force the use of a group
            pre-shared key, which creates vulnerability to a man-in-the-middle
            attack. These requirements do not apply to IKEv2 because it has no
            modes.</t>

            <t>In the IKEv1 Phase 2 Quick Mode, exchanges for creating the
            Phase 2 SA, the Identification Payload MUST be present. This
            requirement does not apply to IKEv2 because it has no modes.</t>

            <t>The following identification type requirements apply to IKEv1.
            ID_IPV4_ADDR, ID_IPV6_ADDR (if the protocol stack supports IPv6)
            and ID_FQDN Identification Types MUST be supported; ID_USER_FQDN
            SHOULD be supported. The IP Subnet, IP Address Range,
            ID_DER_ASN1_DN, and ID_DER_ASN1_GN Identification Types SHOULD NOT
            be used. The ID_KEY_ID Identification Type MUST NOT be used.</t>

            <t>When IKEv2 is supported, the following identification
            requirements apply. ID_IPV4_ADDR, ID_IPV6_ADDR (if the protocol
            stack supports IPv6) and ID_FQDN Identification Types MUST be
            supported; ID_RFC822_ADDR SHOULD be supported. The ID_DER_ASN1_DN,
            and ID_DER_ASN1_GN Identification Types SHOULD NOT be used. The
            ID_KEY_ID Identification Type MUST NOT be used.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The reasons for the identification requirements in items e and f
        above are:<list style="symbols">
            <t>IP Subnet and IP Address Range are too broad to usefully
            identify an iSCSI endpoint.</t>

            <t>The _DN and _GN types are X.500 identities; it is usually
            better to use an identity from subjectAltName in a PKI
            certificate.</t>

            <t>ID_KEY_ID is an opaque identifier that is not interoperable
            among different IPsec implementations as specified. Heterogeneity
            in some block storage protocol implementations can be expected
            (e.g., iSCSI initiator vs. iSCSI target implementations), and
            hence heterogeneity among IPsec implementations is important.</t>

      <section title="D-H Group and PRF Requirements">
        <t>This document does not change the support requirements for
        Diffe-Hellman (D-H) groups and Pseudo-Random Functions (PRFs). See
        <xref target="RFC4109"/> for IKEv1 requirements and <xref
        target="RFC4307"/> for IKEv2 requirements. Implementors are advised to
        check for subsequent RFCs that update either of these RFCs, as such
        updates may change these requirements.</t>

        <t>When DH groups are used, a DH group of at least 2048 bits SHOULD be
        offered as a part of all proposals to create IPsec Security
        Associations for both IKEv1 and IKEv2.</t>

        <t>RFC 3723 requires that the IKEv1 Quick Mode key exchange that
        provides perfect forward secrecy MUST be implemented. This document
        extends that requirement to IKEv2; the CREATE_CHILD_SA key exchange
        that provides perfect forward secrecy MUST be implemented for use of
        IPsec with block storage protocols.</t>

      <t>This Appendix provides the birthday bounds for the 3DES and AES
      ciphers based on <xref target="triple-des-birthday"/>, which states:
      "Theory advises against using a w-bit block cipher to encrypt more than
      2^(w/2) blocks with a single key; this is known as the birthday
      bound."</t>

      <t>For a cipher with a 64-bit block size (e.g., 3DES), w=64, so the
      birthday bound is 2^32 blocks. As each block contains 8 (2^3) bytes, the
      birthday bound is 2^35 bytes = 2^5 gibibytes, i.e., 32 GiB, where 1
      gibibyte (GiB) = 2^30 bytes. Note that a gigabyte (decimal quantity) is
      not the same as a gibibyte (binary quantity), 1 gigabyte (GB) = 10^6
      bytes.</t>

      <t>For a cipher with a 128-bit block size (e.g., AES), w=128, so the
      birthday bound is 2^64 blocks. As each block contains 16 (2^4) bytes,
      the birthday bound is 2^68 bytes = 2^8 exbibytes, i.e., 256 EiB, where 1
      exbibyte (EiB) = 2^60 bytes. Note that an exabyte (decimal quantity) is
      not the same as an exbibyte (binary quantity), 1 exabyte (EB) = 10^9
      bytes.</t>

      <t>David McGrew's observations about the birthday bound implications of
      3DES's 64-bit block size on the ipsec@ietf.org mailing list lead to
      changing from 3DES CBC to AES CBC as the mandatory to implement
      encryption algorithm and including the birthday bound material in
      Appendix A.</t>
