Abstract

   MPLS has defined mechanisms for fault detection and isolation and
   mechanisms for reliably sending an echo reply in RFC 4379.  Source
   routed MPLS LSPs are a technique being proposed to address new use-
   cases.  This document describes how mechanisms defined for MPLS fault
   detection and isolation can be applied for source routed LSPs.

1.  Introduction

   Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined in [RFC4379] a
   simple and efficient mechanism to detect data plane failures in Label
   Switched Paths (LSP) by specifying information to be carried in an
   MPLS "echo request" and "echo reply" for the purposes of fault
   detection and isolation, and mechanisms for reliably sending the echo
   reply.  The functionality is modeled after the ping/traceroute
   paradigm (ICMP echo request [RFC0792]) and is typically referred to
   as MPLS-ping and MPLS-traceroute.

   Source routed LSP is a technique by which the ingress stacks a set of
   tunnels to route the packet through an explicit-route.  Newer use-
   cases (e.g. [OAM-UC], [I-D.geib-spring-oam-usecase]) are being
   explored using this technique and detecting data plane failures is a
   basic requirement in all of them.  This document describes how the
   procedures defined in [RFC4379] can be applied to a source routed
   LSP.

      TTL - Time to Live

      OAM - Operation, Administration, Management/Maintenance

      LSP - Label Switched Path

      FEC - Forwarding Equivalence Class

      SPRING - Source Packet Routing in Networking

3.  Service Labels

   One of the proposals for source routed LSPs is to include service
   labels in the MPLS label stack.  These service labels are used to
   apply a service (as indicated by the service label) to the packet at
   the intermediate LSRs along the explicit-route.  Since these labels
   are part of the MPLS label stack these have implications on MPLS OAM.
   This document describes how the procedures of [RFC4379] can be
   applied to in the absence of service-labels in Section 5.  Additional
   considerations for service labels are included in Section 6 and
   requires further discussion.

4.  Packet Format

4.1.  Target FEC Stack

   The following new FEC Type sub-TLVs are defined to accommodate the
   distribution of labels by Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) OSPF and
   ISIS ([I-D.gredler-rtgwg-igp-label-advertisement],
   [I-D.gredler-isis-label-advertisement],
   [I-D.gredler-ospf-label-advertisement],
   [I-D.previdi-isis-segment-routing-extensions],
   [I-D.psenak-ospf-segment-routing-extensions]).

        +----------------------------+--------+------------------+
        | Sub-Type(suggested values) | Length |   Value Field    |
        +----------------------------+--------+------------------+
        |             17             |   5    | OSPF IPv4 Prefix |
        |             18             |   17   | OSPF IPv6 Prefix |
        |             19             |   5    | ISIS IPv4 Prefix |
        |             20             |   17   | ISIS IPv6 Prefix |

                                  Table 1

4.2.  OSPF IPv4 Prefix

   This value of this sub-TLV is encoded the same as the "Generic IPv4
   Prefix" defined in section 3.2.13 of [RFC4379].

4.3.  OSPF IPv6 Prefix

   This value of this sub-TLV is encoded the same as the "Generic IPv6
   Prefix" defined in section 3.2.14 of [RFC4379].

4.4.  ISIS IPv4 Prefix

   This value of this sub-TLV is encoded the same as the "Generic IPv4
   Prefix" defined in section 3.2.13 of [RFC4379].

4.5.  ISIS IPv6 Prefix

   This value of this sub-TLV is encoded the same as the "Generic IPv6
   Prefix" defined in section 3.2.14 of [RFC4379].

5.  MPLS ping and trace of a source routed LSP

   The MPLS ping procedures described in [RFC4379] can be applied
   unchanged to a source routed LSP.  The ingress should encapsulate the
   "echo request" with the label stack just as any data packet and send
   it on the source routed LSP.  Sometimes it is useful to ping a
   specific tunnel that is used in a source routed LSP.  In this case
   the entire label stack of the source routed LSP must be used, but the
   TTL of labels below the label of the tunnel that being debugged must
   be set to zero.

   When tracing a LSP according to the procedures in [RFC4379] the TTL
   is incremented by one in order to trace the path sequentially along
   the LSP.  However when a source routed LSP has to be traced there are
   as many TTLs as there are labels in the stack.  The LSR that
   initiates the traceroute SHOULD start by setting the TTL to 1 for the
   tunnel in the LSP's label stack it wants to start the tracing from,
   the TTL of all outer labels in the stack to the max value, and the
   TTL of all the inner labels in the stack to zero.  Thus a typical
   start to the traceroute would have a TTL of 1 for the outermost label
   and all the inner labels would have TTL 0.  If the FEC Stack TLV is
   included it should contain only those for the inner stacked tunnels.
   The lack of an echo response or the Return Code/Subcode should be
   used to diagnose the tunnel as described in [RFC4379].  When the
   tracing of a tunnel in the stack is complete, then the next tunnel in
   the stack should be traced.  The end of a tunnel can be detected from

   the "Return Code" when it indicates that the responding LSR is an
   egress for the stack at depth 1.  Thus the traceroute procedures in
   [RFC4379] can be recursively applied to traceroute a source routed
   LSP.

6.  Issues with non-forwarding labels

   Source stacking can be optionally used to apply services on the
   packet at a LSR along the path, where a label in the stack is used to
   trigger service application.  A data plane failure detection and
   isolation mechanism should provide its functionality without applying
   these services.  This is mandatory for services that are stateful,
   though for stateless services [RFC4379] could be used as-is.  It MAY
   also provide a mechanism to detect and isolate faults within the
   service function itself.

   To prevent services from being applied to an "echo request" packet,
   the TTL of service labels MUST be 0.  However TTL processing rules of
   a service label must be the same as any MPLS label.  Due to this a
   TTL of 0 in the service label would prevent the packet from being
   forwarded beyond the LSR that provides the service.  To avoid this
   problem, the originator of the "echo request" must remove those
   service labels from the stack upto the tunnel that is being currently
   traced.  In other words the ingress must remove all service-labels
   above the label of the tunnel being currently traced, but retain
   service labels below it when sending the echo request.  Note that
   load balancing may affect the path when the service labels are
   removed, resulting in a newer path being traversed.  However this new
   path is potentially different only upto the LSR that provides the
   service.  Since this portion of the path was traced when the tunnels
   above this tunnel in the stack were traced and followed the exact
   path as the source routed LSP, this should not be a major concern.
   Sometimes the newer path may have a problem that was not in the
   original path resulting in a false positive.  In such a case the
   original path can be traversed by changing the label stack to reach
   the intermediate LSR with labels that route along each hop
   explicitly.
