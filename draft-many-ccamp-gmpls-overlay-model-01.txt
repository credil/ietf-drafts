Internet-Draft           Overlay model framework            October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) defines both
   routing and signaling protocols for the creation of Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) in various transport technologies and scenarios.

   In multi domain scenarios, the GMPLS enables two different
   architectures: the peer model and the overlay model[RFC4208].  In the
   peer model edge nodes support both a routing and a signaling protocol
   and their interaction with the core nodes is basically the same that
   occurs among core nodes.

   On the other side, in the overlay case, the interaction between edge
   nodes and core nodes is limited to signaling messages exchange and a
   very limited, if any, routing information exchange between core nodes
   and edge nodes regarding other edge nodes reachability.  The edge
   nodes do not participate in the routing instance running in the core
   network domain and do not have any information about its topology.

   This memo is focused on the overlay model frameworks and in
   particular addresses: definitions, methods (i.e.  UNI interface,
   E-NNI interface) and use cases.

      + Client Domain: it is also called overlay network [RFC4208].  It
      is composed by the network elements directly connected to the
      server domain and has no knowledge of the server network topology
      but can retrieve routing information on how to reach other areas
      of the client domain via the server domain.  The interanction with
      the server domain occurs via the overlay interfaces.

      + Client node: Node of the client domain directly connected to an
      access link.  Client nodes can be ingress/egress nodes for overlay
      services and ingress/egress/transit nodes for overlay end-to-end
      LSPs.

      + Service Provider Domain: Network acting as server layer for the
      edge network.  Multiple server domains can be interconnected.

      + Service provider node: Node of the server network without
      interfaces on access TE-Links.

      + Border Service Provider node: Node of the server network
      connected to access TE-links.  It can receive signaling messages

      from client nodes and provide them with routing information
      regarding the other client networks connected to the server
      network.

      + Access TE-link: TE-links between client nodes and server nodes.
      It only can be an interface supporting a transport technolgy (e.g.
      MPLS-TP, OTN, WDM).

      + Inter Domain TE-link: TE-links between server border nodes
      belonging to different server domains.  A server network can be
      composed by multiple server domains.  If an overlay interface is
      supposed to forward server domain topology information to the
      client network it must include topology information of all the
      server domain.  As a consequence topology information of each
      server domain must be forwarded on the inter domain TE-links.

      + Overlay interface: Overlay interfaces are used for setting up
      overlay services and allow the exchange of signaling and routing
      information.  Two types of overlay interfaces are defined in the
      following, namely the GMPLS UNI and GMPLS E-NNI.  Both of them
      allows inter-connecting devices in the client domain which are
      directly connected to the server domain and in either cases the
      service provides domain real topology is not known to the client
      domain but only a virtualized version.

         ++ GMPLS UNI: defined in [RFC4208] and augmented by [INC-
         ROUTE], [TE-REC], [XRO-SUB] and [OBJ-FUNC].

         ++ GMPLS E-NNI: defined in [E-NNI].  The E-NNI interface allows
         signaling and routing information exchange via the access TE-
         link.

      + Overlay service: It can only be established from a client node
      to a client node and have the service provider nodes as transit
      LSRs.  Overlay services are injected by the client nodes into the
      domains where its interfaces (other than the overlay ones) belong
      to so to allow the establishment of end to end LSP crossing the
      client and service provider domains.


3.  Overlay interfaces

3.1.  GMPLS UNI

   [statements]:

      - the GMPLS UNI consider the service provider domains as opaque,
      no inter-domain routing IGP is used and paths (TE link) are not
      exported.  Some (limited) properties of TE links may be requested
      by the client and may be provided by the server layer (based on
      policy), e.g., SRLG, metrics, etc.

      - As there is no service provider domain IGP visibility the path
      computaiton constraints are to be considered by the border service
      provider path computation element.  Those parameters can be
      provided to the border service provider PCE using PCEP or using
      signaling.

      - The lack of IGP visibility do also require the routing
      information described in section 5 to be provided by signaling
      protocol (RRO)

      - once a path is computed (and set up), it can be exported to the
      client layer as a TE-link with given TE parameters and SRLG

      recording

   [requirements]:

      U1.  Must support signaling from client domain to server domain

      U2.  Must support a path computaiton request in the server domain
      with given constraints

      U3.  No server domain topology is exported to the client domain a
      priori (i.e. before the setup of a path in the server layer)

      U4.  May support routing information towards the client server a
      posteriori (i.e. once a path is computed and set up, it may be
      exported to the client layer as a TE-link with given TE parameters
      and SRLG recording

      U5.  The path computation in the server domain can be either
      distributed (i.e. performed by the service provider border node)
      or centralized by a PCE.

      U6. ...

3.2.  GMPLS E-NNI

   [statements]:

      [x] In comparaison to GMPLS UNI the GMPLS E-NNI offer virtual
      topology visibility of the service provider network to the client.
      This offer the advantage of reusing of IGP mechanisms and
      information but may require more coordination from the border
      service provider nodes to offer such topology.

      [x] paths in the service provider domain are precomputed.  They
      can be pre-signaled (i.e. fully committed FA-LSPs) or just pre-
      computed and sharable (virtual TE-links)

      - FA-LSPs and virtual TE-links are exported to the client domain
      via the E-NNI interface with given properties (i.e.  TE
      parameters).  Virtual TE-links are activated via an external
      trigger (e.g.  NMS)

      [] TE-links may then injected in the domain the client node
      belongs to and used for end to end LSPs

   [requirements]:

      E1.  Must support signaling from client domain to server domain

      E2.  Must support routing information towards the client server a
      priori (i.e. a set of pre-computed or pre-provisioned paths in the
      server domain must be exported to the client domain as provisioned
      or virtual TE-links with given TE parameters and SRLG recording

      E3.  No server domain topology is exported to the client domain

      E4.  Server layer domain may be exported to the client domain as a
      virtual node

      E5.  The path computation in the server domain can be either
      distributed (i.e. performed by the service provider border node)
      or centralized by a PCE.

      E6. ...

   [description]

   In order to be able to compute an end-to-end path between a pair of
   client nodes, the client TE topology must be sufficiently augmented
   to indicate via some fashion the paths through the server topology
   which can provide connectivity between nodes in the client topology.
   In other words, the feasible paths across each server network domain
   should be made available in terms of TE links/nodes to all the
   clients.  GMPLS-ENNI provides the tools required to do this
   augmentation.

   There are different ways of augmenting the client topology.  This
   document discusses 3 approaches in the following subsections.

3.2.1.  Pre-Provisioned Server Paths

   In this approach, the paths in the server domain are provisioned up
   front and advertised as TE links in the client network domain.  This
   means that relevant server network resources are committed before the
   service is setup in the client network.

                      Figure 3: Pre-provisioned paths

   In Figure 3 the Server Domain Path [S4-S2-S5-S3] is pre-provisioned
   and the TE-Link [S4-S3] is advertised in to the Client-Domain.  This
   makes the computation of an end-to-end Client Domain Path from C3 to
   C2 possible.

3.2.2.  Virtual Links

   In this approach, potential paths in the server domain are advertised
   as Virtual TE links in the client network domain.  The Virtual TE
   link is advertised just like a real TE link and does not require the
   allocation of resources in the server domain.

   In Figure 4 , the Virtual TE-Link [S4-S3] is advertised into the
   client domain based on the presense of the potential path
   [S4-S2-S5-S3] in the server domain.  This makes the computation of an
   end-to-end Client Domain Path from C3 to C2 possible.  The resources
   in the server domain get provisioned only when the corresponding
   client service gets signaled.

3.2.3.  Virtual Nodes

   In this approach, the server domain topology is presented to the
   clients as a Virtual TE Node.

   Virtual Node in the Client network.


4.  Signaling: Info passed from Edge Network to Core network

   The client node may need to constraint the path used in the service
   provider domains.Those constraints may be :

      - Objective Functions

      - TE Metric for a loose segment

      - Node/Link/SRLG inclusion

      - Node/Link/SRLG exclusion

      - Path used by another LSP(from: draft-ali-xro-lsp-subobject)

   (from:draft-ali-objective-functions) - the ingress node may need to
   request remote node to perform path computation or expansion.  In
   such cases, ingress node needs to convey the required objective
   function to the remote node, to enable it to perform the desired path
   computation.  Similarly, there are cases the ingress needs to
   indicate a TE metric bound for a loose segment that is expanded by a
   remote node.

   (from: draft-ali-xro-lsp-subobject) - Moreover there are cases in
   which a remote node is requested to compute a path exluding LSPs
   currently existing or expected to exist withing the network.

   Hence what needs to be available to the remote node (ingress core
   node) is:

      + Objective function(draft-ali-objective-functions):A set of one
      or more specific optimization criteria that must be followed in
      expanding route of a TE-LSP in MPLS and GMPLS networks: Minimum TE
      Metric Cost, Minimum IGP Metric Cost, Minimum Latency, Minimum
      Latency Variation

      + Metric(draft-ali-objective-functions):the bound on the path
      metric that must not be exceeded for the loose segment to be
      considered as acceptable by the ingress node

      + Include Route(draft-ali-include-route):There are scenarios that
      require two or more LSPs or segments of LSPs to follow same route
      in the network: Explicit Inclusion Route

Internet-Draft           Overlay model framework            October 2012


      + Exclude Route(draft-ali-xro-lsp0subobject):

      + Exclude Route(RFC4874)


5.  routing: Info passed from Core Network to Edge network

   (draft-beeram) - It is important to note that topology information is
   layer-specific; e.g. path computation and qualification operations
   occur within a given layer, and hence information about topology and
   resource availability are required for the specific layer to which
   the connection belongs.  The topology and resource availability
   information required by a path computation element in the client
   layer is quite distinct from that required by a path computation
   element in the server layer network.  Hence, the actual server layer
   traffic engineering links are of no importance for the client layer
   network.  In fact, it can be desirable to block their advertisements
   into the client TE domain by the border nodes.

   (draft-ali-te-metric-recording): Moreover there are many scenarios in
   which Traffic Engineering (TE) metrics such as cost, latency and
   latency variation associated with a Forwarding Adjacency (FA) or
   Routing Adjacency (RA) Label Switched Path (LSP) are not available to
   the ingress (edge node) and egress nodes.


6.  Use cases

      + L1VPN (from draft-fedyk)

      + IP/MPLS Offloading with ENNI automation (from draft-enni)

      + Service Optimization and Restoration in Multi-layer networks
      (from draft enni)

      + Use of PCE and VNTM in Multi-layer Network Operation (from draft
      enni)
