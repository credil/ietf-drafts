1. Introduction 

   With the evolution and deployment of OTN technology, it is necessary 
   that appropriate enhanced control technology support be provided for 
   [G709-2012].  

   [OTN-FWK] provides a framework to allow the development of protocol 
   extensions to support GMPLS and Path Computation Element (PCE) 
   control of OTN as specified in [G709-2012]. Based on this framework, 
   [OTN-INFO] evaluates the information needed by the routing and 
   signaling process in OTNs to support GMPLS control of OTN. 

   [RFC4328] describes the control technology details that are specific 
   to the 2001 revision of the G.709 specification. This document 
   updates [RFC4328] to provide Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic 
   Engineering (RSVP-TE) extensions to support of control for [G709-
   2012].  

    

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",   
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this   
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

    

3. GMPLS Extensions for the Evolving G.709 - Overview 

   New features for the evolving OTN, for example, new ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 
   and ODUflex containers are specified in [G709-2012]. The 
   corresponding new signal types are summarized below: 

      -  Optical Channel Transport Unit (OTUk): 
         . OTU4 

      -  Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUk): 
         . ODU0 
         . ODU2e 
         . ODU4 
         . ODUflex 

   A new Tributary Slot Granularity (TS Granularity, TSG) (i.e., 1.25 
   Gbps) is also described in [G709-2012]. Thus, there are now two TS 
   granularities for the foundation OTN ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 containers. 

 
 
Zhang                     Expires May 2013                      [Page 3] 

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3-05.txt             November 2012 


   The TS granularity at 2.5 Gbps is used on legacy interfaces while the 
   new 1.25 Gbps is used on the new interfaces. 

   In addition to the support of ODUk mapping into OTUk (k = 1, 2, 3, 
   4), the evolving OTN [G.709-V3] encompasses the multiplexing of ODUj 
   (j = 0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, flex) into an ODUk (k > j), as described in 
   Section 3.1.2 of [OTN-FWK]. 

   Virtual Concatenation (VCAT) of Optical channel Payload Unit-k (OPUk) 
   (OPUk-Xv, k = 1/2/3, X = 1...256) is also supported by [G709-2012]. 
   Note that VCAT of OPU0 / OPU2e / OPU4 / OPUflex is not supported per 
   [G709-2012]. 

   [RFC4328] describes GMPLS signaling extensions to support the control 
   for the 2001 revision of the G.709 specification. However, [RFC4328] 
   needs to be updated because it does not provide the means to signal 
   all the new signal types and related mapping and multiplexing 
   functionalities. Moreover, it supports only the deprecated auto- 
   Multiframe Structure Identifier (MSI) mode which assumes that the 
   Tributary Port Number (TPN) is automatically assigned in the transmit 
   direction and not checked in the receive direction. 

   This document extends the G.709 traffic parameters described in 
   [RFC4328] and presents a new flexible and scalable OTN label format. 
   Additionally, procedures about Tributary Port Number assignment 
   through control plane are also provided in this document. 

    

4. Generalized Label Request  

   The Generalized Label Request, as described in [RFC3471], carries the 
   Label Switched Path (LSP) Encoding Type, the Switching Type and the 
   Generalized Protocol Identifier (G-PID).  

   [RFC4328] extends the Generalized Label Request, introducing two new 
   code-points for the LSP Encoding Type (i.e., G.709 ODUk (Digital 
   Path) and G.709 Optical Channel) and adding a list of G-PID values in 
   order to accommodate the 2001 revision of the G.709 specification. 

   This document follows these extensions and a new Switching Type is 
   introduced to indicate the ODUk switching capability [G709-2012] in 
   order to support backward compatibility with [RFC4328], as described 
   in [OTN-FWK]. The new Switching Type (101, TBA by IANA) is defined in 
   [OTN-OSPF]. 

   This document also updates the G-PID values defined in [RFC4328]:

   Value    G-PID Type  
   -----    ----------        
   47       ODU-2.5G: transport of Digital Paths (e.g., at 2.5, 10 and 
                      40 Gbps) via 2.5Gbps TSG 

   49       CBRa:     asynchronous Constant Bit Rate (CBR) (e.g., 
                      mapping of CBR2G5, CBR10G and CBR40G) 

   50       CBRb:     bit synchronous Constant Bit Rate (e.g., mapping 
                      of CBR2G5, CBR10G, CBR40G, CBR10G3 and supra-
                      2.488 CBR Gbit/s signal (carried by OPUflex)) 

   32       ATM:      mapping of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cell 
                      stream (e.g., at 1.25, 2.5, 10 and 40 Gbps) 

   51       BSOT:     non-specific client Bit Stream with Octet Timing 
                      (e.g., Mapping of 1.25, 2.5, 10, 40 and 100 Gbps 
                      Bit Stream) 

   52       BSNT:     non-specific client Bit Stream without Octet 
                      Timing (e.g., Mapping of 1.25, 2.5, 10, 40 and 
                      100 Gbps Bit Stream) 

   Note: Values 32, 47, 49 and 50 include mapping of Synchronous Digital 
   Hierarchy (SDH). 

   In the case of ODU multiplexing, the Lower Order ODU (LO ODU) (i.e., 
   the client signal) may be multiplexed into Higher Order ODU (HO ODU) 
   via 1.25G TSG, 2.5G TSG or any one of them (i.e., TSG 
   Auto_Negotiation is enabled). Since the G-PID type "ODUk" defined in 
   [RFC4328] is only used for 2.5Gbps TSG, two new G-PID types are 
   defined as follows:  

   - ODU-1.25G:  transport of Digital Paths at 1.25, 2.5, 10, 40 and 100 
                 Gbps via 1.25Gbps TSG 

   - ODU-any:    transport of Digital Paths at 1.25, 2.5, 10, 40 and 100 
                 Gbps via 1.25 or 2.5Gbps TSG (i.e., the fallback 
                 procedure is enabled and the default value of 1.25Gbps 
                 TSG can be fallen back to 2.5Gbps if needed) 

   In addition, some other new G-PID types are defined to support other 
   new client signals described in [G709-2012]: 

   - CBRc:       Mapping of constant bit-rate signals with justification 
                 into OPUk (k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) via Generic Mapping 
                 Procedure (GMP) (i.e., mapping of sub-1.238, supra-

                 and close-to 104.134 Gbit/s CBR client signal) 

   - 1000BASE-X: Mapping of a 1000BASE-X signal via timing transparent 
                 transcoding into OPU0

                 transcoding into OPU2e 

   The following table summarizes the new G-PID values with respect to 
   the LSP Encoding Type:

   Note: Values 59 and 60 include mapping of SDH. 

    

5. Extensions for Traffic Parameters for the Evolving G.709 

   The traffic parameters for OTN-TDM capable Switching Type are carried 
   in the OTN-TDM SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects. The objects have 
   the following class and type: 

      -  OTN-TDM SENDER_TSPEC Object: Class = 12, C-Type = 7 (TBA) 
      -  OTN-TDM FLOWSPEC Object: Class = 9, C-Type = 7 (TBA) 

   The format of traffic parameters in these two objects are defined as 
   follows: 

      0                   1                   2                   3

               resizable (i.e., 1.25*N Gbps)

      23~255   Reserved (for future use) 
    
   In case of ODUflex(CBR), the Bit_Rate and Tolerance fields MUST be 
   used together to represent the actual bandwidth of ODUflex, where: 

   -  The Bit_Rate field indicates the nominal bit rate of ODUflex(CBR) 
      expressed in bytes per second, encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-
      precision floating-point number (referring to [RFC4506] and 
      [IEEE]). The value contained in the Bit Rate field has to keep 
      into account both 239/238 factor and the Transcoding factor. 

   -  The Tolerance field indicates the bit rate tolerance (part per 
      million, ppm) of the ODUflex(CBR) encoded as an unsigned integer, 
      which MUST be bounded in 0~100ppm. 

   For example, for an ODUflex(CBR) service with Bit_Rate = 2.5Gbps and 
   Tolerance = 100ppm, the actual bandwidth of the ODUflex is: 

                         2.5Gbps * (1 +/- 100ppm) 

   In case of ODUflex(GFP), the Bit_Rate field is used to indicate the 
   nominal bit rate of the ODUflex(GFP), which implies the number of 
   tributary slots requested for the ODUflex(GFP). Since the tolerance 
   of ODUflex(GFP) makes no sense on tributary slot resource

   reservation, the Tolerance field for ODUflex(GFP) is not necessary 
   and MUST be filled with 0. 

   In case of other ODUk signal types, the Bit_Rate and Tolerance fields 
   are not necessary and MUST be set to 0. 

   The usage of the NVC and Multiplier (MT) fields are the same as 
   [RFC4328]. 
   
   Note that the error process on the traffic parameters MUST follow the 
   rules defined in Section 6 of [RFC4328].
    

5.1. Usage of ODUflex(CBR) Traffic Parameters 

   In case of ODUflex(CBR), the information of Bit_Rate and Tolerance in 
   the ODUflex traffic parameters MUST be used to determine the total 
   number of tributary slots N in the HO ODUk link to be reserved. Here:  

         N = Ceiling of 

   ODUflex(CBR) nominal bit rate * (1 + ODUflex(CBR) bit rate tolerance) 
   --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
       ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 - HO OPUk bit rate tolerance) 

   In this formula, the ODUflex(CBR) nominal bit rate is the bit rate of 
   the ODUflex(CBR) on the line side, i.e., the client signal bit rate 
   after applying the 239/238 factor (according to Clause 7.3, Table 7-2 
   of [G709-2012]) and the transcoding factor T (if needed) on the CBR 
   client. According to clauses 17.7.3, 17.7.4 and 17.7.5 of [G709-

    Note that: 

      Minimum bit rate of ODUTk.ts =  
         ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 - HO OPUk bit rate tolerance) 

    
      Maximum bit rate of ODTUk.ts =  
         ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 + HO OPUk bit rate tolerance) 

      Where: HO OPUk bit rate tolerance = 20ppm 

   Therefore, a node receiving a PATH message containing ODUflex(CBR)  
   nominal bit rate and tolerance can allocate precise number of 
   tributary slots and set up the cross-connection for the ODUflex 
   service.  

   Note that for different ODUk, the bit rates of the tributary slots 
   are different, and so the total number of tributary slots to be 
   reserved for the ODUflex(CBR) MAY not be the same on different HO 
   ODUk links. 

   An example is given below to illustrate the usage of ODUflex(CBR) 
   traffic parameters. 

   As shown in Figure 1, assume there is an ODUflex(CBR) service 
   requesting a bandwidth of (2.5Gbps, +/-100ppm) from node A to node C. 
   In other words, the ODUflex traffic parameters indicate that Signal 
   Type is 20 (ODUflex(CBR)), Bit_Rate is 2.5Gbps and Tolerance is 
   100ppm.

   -  On the HO ODU4 link between node A and B: 

      The maximum bit rate of the ODUflex(CBR) equals 2.5Gbps * (1 + 
      100ppm), and the minimum bit rate of the tributary slot of ODU4 
      equals 1,301,683.217 Kbps, so the total number of tributary slots 
      N1 to be reserved on this link is: 

      N1 = ceiling (2.5Gbps * (1 + 100ppm) / 1,301,683.217 Kbps) = 2 

   -  On the HO ODU2 link between node B and C: 

      The maximum bit rate of the ODUflex equals 2.5Gbps * (1 + 
      100ppm), and the minimum bit rate of the tributary slot of ODU2 
      equals 1,249,384.632 Kbps, so the total number of tributary slots 
      N2 to be reserved on this link is: 

      N2 = ceiling (2.5Gbps * (1 + 100ppm) / 1,249,384.632 Kbps) = 3 

    

5.2. Usage of ODUflex(GFP) Traffic Parameters 

   [G709-2012] recommends that the ODUflex(GFP) will fill an integral 
   number of tributary slots of the smallest HO ODUk path over which the 
   ODUflex(GFP) may be carried, as shown in Table 2.  

    

         Table 2 - Recommended ODUflex(GFP) bit rates and tolerance 

              ODU type             | Nominal bit-rate | Tolerance 
   --------------------------------+------------------+----------- 
   ODUflex(GFP) of n TS, 1<=n<=8   |   n * ODU2.ts    | +/-100 ppm 
   ODUflex(GFP) of n TS, 9<=n<=32  |   n * ODU3.ts    | +/-100 ppm 
   ODUflex(GFP) of n TS, 33<=n<=80 |   n * ODU4.ts    | +/-100 ppm 

    

   According to this table, the Bit_Rate field for ODUflex(GFP) MUST 
   equal to one of the 80 values listed below: 

       1 * ODU2.ts; 2 * ODU2.ts; ...; 8 * ODU2.ts; 
       9 * ODU3.ts; 10 * ODU3.ts, ...; 32 * ODU3.ts; 
       33 * ODU4.ts; 34 * ODU4.ts; ...; 80 * ODU4.ts.

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3-05.txt             November 2012 


   In this way, the number of required tributary slots for the 
   ODUflex(GFP) (i.e., the value of "n" in Table 2) can be deduced from 
   the Bit_Rate field. 

    

6. Generalized Label 

   This section defines the format of the OTN-TDM Generalized Label.   

6.1. OTN-TDM Switching Type Generalized Label 

   The following is the Generalized Label format for that MUST be used 
   with the OTN-TDM Switching Type: 

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |         TPN           |   Reserved    |        Length         | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   ~                   Bit Map          ......                     ~ 
   ~              ......                   |     Padding Bits      ~ 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   The OTN-TDM Generalized Label is used to indicate how the LO ODUj 
   signal is multiplexed into the HO ODUk link. Note that the LO OUDj 
   signal type is indicated by traffic parameters, while the type of HO 
   ODUk link is identified by the selected interface carried in the 
   IF_ID RSVP_HOP Object. 

   TPN (12 bits): indicates the TPN for the assigned Tributary Slot(s).  

      -  In case of LO ODUj multiplexed into HO ODU1/ODU2/ODU3, only the 
         lower 6 bits of TPN field are significant and the other bits of 
         TPN MUST be set to 0. 

      -  In case of LO ODUj multiplexed into HO ODU4, only the lower 7 
         bits of TPN field are significant and the other bits of TPN 
         MUST be set to 0.  

      -  In case of ODUj mapped into OTUk (j=k), the TPN is not needed 
         and this field MUST be set to 0. 

   Per [G709-2012], The TPN is used to allow for correct demultiplexing 
   in the data plane. When an LO ODUj is multiplexed into HO ODUk 
   occupying one or more TSs, a new TPN value is configured at the two 
   ends of the HO ODUk link and is put into the related MSI byte(s) in

   the OPUk overhead at the (traffic) ingress end of the link, so that 
   the other end of the link can learn which TS(s) is/are used by the LO 
   ODUj in the data plane. 

   According to [G709-2012], the TPN field MUST be set as according to 
   the following tables:

   | ODU4  |Any ODU|1~80|Flexible, != ANY other existing LO ODUs' TPNs | 
   +-------+-------+----+----------------------------------------------+ 

   Note that in the case of "Flexible", the value of TPN MAY not be 
   corresponding to the TS number as per [G709-2012].  

   Length (12 bits): indicates the number of bits of the Bit Map field, 
   i.e., the total number of TS in the HO ODUk link. The valid values 
   for this field are 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 80.

   In case of an ODUk mapped into OTUk, there is no need to indicate 
   which tributary slots will be used, so the length field MUST be set 
   to 0. 

   Bit Map (variable): indicates which tributary slots in HO ODUk that 
   the LO ODUj will be multiplexed into. The sequence of the Bit Map is 
   consistent with the sequence of the tributary slots in HO ODUk. Each 
   bit in the bit map represents the corresponding tributary slot in HO 
   ODUk with a value of 1 or 0 indicating whether the tributary slot 
   will be used by LO ODUj or not. 

   Padding bits are added after the Bit Map to make the whole label a 
   multiple of four bytes if necessary. Padding bits MUST be set to 0 
   and MUST be ignored. 

6.2. Procedures 

   When a node receives a generalized label request for setting up an 
   ODUj LSP from its upstream neighbor node, the node MUST generate an 
   OTN-TDM label according to the signal type of the requested LSP and 
   the free resources (i.e., free tributary slots of ODUk) that will be 
   reserved for the LSP, and send the label to its upstream neighbor 
   node.  

   In case of ODUj to ODUk multiplexing, the node MUST firstly determine 
   the size of the Bit Map field according to the signal type and the 
   tributary slot type of ODUk, and then set the bits to 1 in the Bit 
   Map field corresponding to the reserved tributary slots. The node 
   MUST also assign a valid TPN, which MUST NOT collide with other TPN 
   value used by existing LO ODU connections in the selected HO ODU 
   link, and configure the Expected MSI (ExMSI) using this TPN. Then, 
   the assigned TPN MUST be filled into the label. 

   In case of ODUk to OTUk mapping, TPN field MUST be set to 0. Bit Map 
   information is not REQUIRED and MUST NOT be included, so Length field 
   MUST be set to 0 as well.  

   The node receiving a OTN-TDM generalized label MUST firstly identify 
   which ODU signal type is multiplexed or mapped into which ODU signal 
   type accordingly to the traffic parameters and the IF_ID RSVP_HOP 
   Object in the received message.  

   In case of ODUj to ODUk multiplexing, the node MUST retrieve the 
   reserved tributary slots in the ODUk by its downstream neighbor node 
   according to the position of the bits that are set to 1 in the Bit 
   Map field. The node determines the TS type (according to the total TS 
   number of the ODUk, or pre-configured TS type), so that the node, 
 
 
Zhang                     Expires May 2013                     [Page 13] 

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3-05.txt             November 2012 


   based on the TS type, can multiplex the ODUj into the ODUk. The node 
   MUST also retrieve the TPN value assigned by its downstream neighbor 
   node from the label, and fill the TPN into the related MSI byte(s) in 
   the OPUk overhead in the data plane, so that the downstream neighbor 
   node can check whether the TPN received from the data plane is 
   consistent with the ExMSI and determine whether there is any mismatch 
   defect. 

   Note that the Length field in the label format MAY be used to 
   indicate the TS type of the HO ODUk (i.e., TS granularity at 1.25Gbps 
   or 2.5Gbps) since the HO ODUk type can be known from IF_ID RSVP_HOP 
   Object. In some cases when there is no Link Management Protocol (LMP) 
   or routing to make the two end points of the link to know the TSG, 
   the TSG information used by another end can be deduced from the label 
   format. For example, for HO ODU2 link, the value of the length filed 
   will be 4 or 8, which indicates the TS granularity is 2.5Gbps or 
   1.25Gbps, respectively. 

   In case of ODUk to OTUk mapping, the size of Bit Map field MUST be 0 
   and no additional procedure is needed. 

   In order to create bidirectional LSP, an upstream node MUST generate 
   an Upstream Label on the out outgoing interface to indicate the 
   reserved TSs of ODUk and the assigned TPN value in the upstream 
   direction. This Upstream Label is sent to the downstream node via 
   Path massage for upstream resource reservation. 

   The upstream node MAY generate Label Set to indicate which labels on 
   the outgoing interface in the downstream direction are acceptable. 
   The downstream node will restrict its choice of labels, i.e., TS 
   resource and TPN value, to one which is in the Label Set. 

   The upstream node MAY also generate Suggested Label to indicate the 
   preference of TS resource and TPN value on the outgoing interface in 
   the downstream direction. The downstream node is not REQUIRED to use 
   the Suggested Label and MAY use another label based on local decision 
   and send it to the upstream node, as described in [RFC3473]. 

   The ingress node of an LSP MAY include label ERO to indicate the 
   label in each hops along the path. Note that the TPN in the label ERO 
   (Explicit Route Object) subobject MAY not be assigned by the ingress 
   node. In this case, the node MUST assign a valid TPN value and then 
   put this value into TPN field of the label object when receiving a 
   Path message.

6.2.1. Notification on Label Error 

   When receiving an OTN-TDM label from the neighbor node, the node MUST 
   check whether the label is acceptable. An error message containing an 
   "Unacceptable label value" indication ([RFC3209]) MUST be sent if one 
   of the following cases occurs: 

   -  Invalid value in the length field; 

   -  The selected link only supports 2.5Gbps TS granularity while the 
      Length field in the label along with ODUk signal type indicates 
      the 1.25Gbps TS granularity; 

   -  The label includes an invalid TPN value that breaks the TPN 
      assignment rules; 

   -  The indicated resources (i.e., the number of "1" in the Bit Map 
      field) are inconsistent with the Traffic Parameters. 

6.3. Supporting Virtual Concatenation and Multiplication 

   Per [RFC6344], the Virtual Concatenation Groups (VCGs) can be created 
   using Co-Signaled style or Multiple LSPs style. 

   In case of Co-Signaled style, the explicit ordered list of all labels 
   MUST reflect the order of VCG members, which is similar to [RFC4328]. 
   In case of multiplexed virtually concatenated signals (NVC > 1), the 
   first label MUST indicate the components of the first virtually 
   concatenated signal; the second label MUST indicate the components of 
   the second virtually concatenated signal; and so on. In case of 
   multiplication of multiplexed virtually concatenated signals (MT > 
   1), the first label MUST indicate the components of the first 
   multiplexed virtually concatenated signal; the second label MUST 
   indicate components of the second multiplexed virtually concatenated 
   signal; and so on. 

   In case of Multiple LSPs style, multiple control plane LSPs are 
   created with a single VCG and the VCAT Call SHOULD be used to 
   associate the control plane LSPs. The procedures are similar to 
   section 6 of [RFC6344]. 

6.4. Examples  

   The following examples are given in order to illustrate the label 
   format described in Section 5.1 of this document. 

   (1) ODUk into OTUk mapping:

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3-05.txt             November 2012 


   In such conditions, the downstream node along an LSP returns a label 
   indicating that the ODUk (k=1, 2, 3, 4) is directly mapped into the 
   corresponding OTUk. The following example label indicates an ODU1 
   mapped into OTU1. 

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   (2) ODUj into ODUk multiplexing:  

   In such conditions, this label indicates that an ODUj is multiplexed 
   into several tributary slots of OPUk and then mapped into OTUk. Some 
   instances are shown as follow: 

   -  ODU0 into ODU2 Multiplexing: 

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |       TPN = 2         |   Reserved    |     Length = 8        | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0|             Padded Bits (0)                   | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   This above label indicates an ODU0 multiplexed into the second

   is 1. 

    

7. Supporting Hitless Adjustment of ODUflex (GFP) 

   [G7044] describes the procedure of ODUflex (GFP) hitless resizing 
   using Link Connection Resize (LCR) and Bandwidth Resize (BWR) 
   protocols in OTN data plane. 

   For the control plane, signaling messages are REQUIRED to initiate 
   the adjustment procedure. Section 2.5 and Section 4.6.4 of [RFC3209] 
   describe how the Shared Explicit (SE) style is used in Traffic 
   Engineering (TE) network for bandwidth increasing and decreasing, 
   which is still applicable for triggering the ODUflex (GFP) adjustment 
   procedure in data plane.  

   Note that the SE style MUST be used at the beginning when creating a 
   resizable ODUflex connection (Signal Type = 21). Otherwise an error 
   with Error Code "Conflicting reservation style" MUST be generated 
   when performing bandwidth adjustment. 

   -  Bandwidth increasing 

       In order to increase the bandwidth of an ODUflex (GFP) 
       connection, a Path message with SE style (keeping Tunnel ID 
       unchanged and assigning a new LSP ID) MUST be sent along the 
       path. 

       A downstream node compares the old Traffic Parameters (stored 
       locally) with the new one carried in the Path message, to 
       determine the number of TS to be added. After choosing and 
       reserving new free TS, the downstream node MUST send back a Resv 
       message carrying both the old and new LABEL Objects in the SE 
       flow descriptor, so that its upstream neighbor can determine 

 
 
Zhang                     Expires May 2013                     [Page 17] 

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3-05.txt             November 2012 


       which TS are added. And the LCR protocol between each pair of 
       neighbor nodes MUST be triggered. 

       On the source node, the BWR protocol will be triggered by the 
       successful completion of LCR protocols on every hop after Resv 
       message is processed. On success of BWR, the source node MUST 
       send a PathTear message to delete the old control state (i.e., 
       the control state of the ODUflex (GFP) before resizing) on the 
       control plane. 

   -  Bandwidth decreasing 

       The SE style SHOULD also be used for ODUflex bandwidth 
       decreasing. For each pair of neighbor nodes, the sending and 
       receiving Resv message with old and new LABEL Objects will 
       trigger the first step of LCR between them to perform LCR 
       handshake. On the source node, the BWR protocol will be triggered 
       by the successful completion of LCR handshake on every hop after 
       Resv message is processed. On success of BWR, the second step of 
       LCR, i.e., link connection decrease procedure will be started on 
       every hop of the connection. 

       Similarly, after completion of bandwidth decreasing, a ResvErr 
       message SHOULD be sent to tear down the old control state. 

        

8. Control Plane Backward Compatibility Considerations 

   As described in [OTN-FWK], since the [RFC4328] has been deployed in 
   the network for the nodes that support the 2001 revision of the G.709 
   specification, control plane backward compatibility SHOULD be taken 
   into consideration. More specifically: 

   o  Nodes supporting this document SHOULD support [OTN-OSPF]. 

   o  Nodes supporting this document MAY support [RFC4328] signaling. 

   o  A node supporting both sets of procedures (i.e., [RFC4328] and 
      this document) is not REQUIRED to signal an LSP using both 
      procedures, i.e., to act as a signaling version translator. 

   o  Ingress nodes that support both sets of procedures MAY select 
      which set of procedures to follow based on routing information or 
      local policy.

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3-05.txt             November 2012 


   o  Per [RFC3473], nodes that do not support this document will 
      generate a PathErr message, with a "Routing problem/Switching 
      Type" indication. 

    

9. Security Considerations 

   This document introduces no new security considerations to the 
   existing GMPLS signaling protocols. Referring to [RFC3473] and 
   [RFC4328], further details of the specific security measures are 
   provided. Additionally, [RFC5920] provides an overview of security 
   vulnerabilities and protection mechanisms for the GMPLS control 
   plane. 

    

10. IANA Considerations 

   Three RSVP C-Types are defined for OTN-TDM Traffic Parameters and 
   OTN-TDM Generalized Label in this document. 

   -  OTN-TDM SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects: 

       o OTN-TDM SENDER_TSPEC Object: Class = 12, C-Type = 7 (see 
         Section 4) 

       o OTN-TDM FLOWSPEC Object: Class = 9, C-Type = 7 (see Section 4) 

   -  OTN-TDM Generalized Label Object: 

       o OTN-TDM Generalized Label Object: Class = 16, C-Type = 2 (see 
         Section 5.1) 

   IANA will also track the code-point spaces extended and/or updated by 
   this document. The Generalized PID has been added in the newly 
   requested registry entry: 

   -  Generalized PID (G-PID): 

       Name: G-PID 

       Format: 16-bit number 

       Values:
