Abstract

   The specification fulfills the requirement from Third Generation
   Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) by registering a Uniform Resource Name
   (URN) namespace for the device identity and a sub namespace for the
   Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID).  The structure of the MEID is 15
   hexadecimal encoded digits long and is defined in 3GPP2 to uniquely
   identify a mobile equipment.

Internet-Draft               MEID Based URN                February 2013


1.  Introduction

   This specification registers a URN namespace for the device identity
   and a sub namespace for the MEID.  This namespace in combination with
   this sub namespace are only used by the 3GPP2 mobile equipment when
   attached to an Internet Protocol (IP) network.  The MEID is managed
   by 3GPP2.  While this specification registers only MEID sub namespace
   under the device identity URN namspace, other sub namespaces under
   device identity namespace may be registered in the future through
   publication of future RFCs.

   The MEID is 15 hexadecimal digits long and includes a manufacturer
   code of 8 hexadecimal digits and the serial number of 6 hexadecimal
   digits plus a hexadecimal digit as a check digit.

   The manufacturer code identifies the mobile equipment manufacturer,
   or regional administration body and mobile equipment manufacturer.
   The values of manufacturer code uniquely identify the mobile
   equipment manufacturer.  The serial number uniquely identifies each
   mobile equipment within the manufacturer.  The check digit is used as
   assurance of integrity in error-prone operations, e.g. when used with
   certain types of readers during inventory management operations.  The
   check digit is not transmitted and the value is always set to 0 by
   the mobile equipment in deployed operations.

   The information here is meant to be a concise guide for those wishing
   to use the MEID as a URN.  Nothing in this document should be
   construed to override [S.R0048-A] that defines the MEID.

4.  Namespace Registration Template for Device Identity

   Namespace ID: "device-id" requested

   Registration Information:

   Registration version number: 1

   Registration date: 2011-08-23

   Sub namespace: "meid" requested

   Registration Information:

   Registration version number: 1

   Registration date: 2011-08-23

   Declared registrant of the namespace: 3GPP2, 2500 Wilson Boulevard,
   Suite 300, Arlington, Virginia 22201 (USA)

   Declaration of syntactic structure: The identifier is expressed in
   ASCII (UTF-8) characters and has a hierarchical structure as follows:


  urn:device-id:<device-id-specifier>
                              [:<device-id-specifier-defined-substring>]

  where:

  <device-id-specifier> = "meid"|<device-id-specifier-defined-string>
  <device-id-specifier-defined-string> = other device equipment
                                         identifier
  <device-id-specifier-defined-substring> = string satisfying the format
                                            of <device-id-specifier>

   The device identity namespace includes a predefined namespace for
   MEID.  The device identity namespace may in the future be extended to
   include other device identifiers.

   An MEID is an identifier under the device identity namespace that
   uniquely identifies mobile equipment used in 3GPP2 defined networks.

   The internal representation of an MEID is a specific number of
   hexadecimal digits, as described in [S.R0048-A].  To accurately
   represent an MEID as a URN, it is necessary to convert the
   hexadecimal digits to a string representation.

Internet-Draft               MEID Based URN                February 2013


   The following Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) includes the set of
   core rules in [RFC5234], which are not repeated here.

   The formal definition of the MEID string representation for the
   device-id-specifier-defined-substring for the "meid" device-id-
   specifier is provided by the following [RFC5234]:

    MEID =  Manufacturer Code "-" Serial Number "-" Check digit
    Manufacturer Code      = 8DIGIT
    Serial Number          = 6DIGIT
    Check Digit            = "0"


    For example:
               urn:device-id:meid:A04B0D56-02A7E3-0;

   The <device-id-specifier>, <device-id-specifier-defined-string>, and
   <device-id-specifier-defined-substring> can comprise any ASCII
   characters compliant with URN syntax in [RFC2141].

   The 3GPP2 is responsible for the <device-id-specifier> "meid" and for
   managing the sub-levels below "meid".

   Identifier uniqueness considerations: Identifiers in the "device-id"
   namespace are defined and assigned in the requested namespace by the
   3GPP2 or an agency appointed by 3GPP2, and within each manufacturer
   code space by each mobile equipment manufacturer, after ensuring that
   the URNs to be assigned are unique.  Uniqueness is achieved by
   checking against the registry of previously assigned names.

   Procedures are in place to ensure that each MEID is uniquely assigned
   by the mobile equipment manufacturer so that it is guaranteed to
   uniquely identify that particular mobile equipment.

   Identifier persistence considerations: The 3GPP2 is committed to
   maintaining uniqueness and persistence of all resources identified by
   assigned URNs.

   Process of identifier assignment: The 3GPP2 or its approved agency
   will manage the <device-id-specifier> and <device-id-specifier-
   defined-substring> identifier resources to maintain uniqueness when
   <device-id-specifier> is "meid".

   Process for identifier resolution: Since the device identity
   namespace is not globally resolvable, this is not applicable.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence: Consider each field of the MEID
   <device-id-specifier-defined-substring> to be a sequence of

Internet-Draft               MEID Based URN                February 2013


   hexadecimal digits.  Then, to compare a pair of MEIDs, compare the
   corresponding fields of the <device-id-specifier-defined-substring>
   from each MEID in order of significance and according to their data
   type.  Two MEIDs are equal if and only if all the corresponding
   fields are equal.

   The lexical equivalence of the device-id namespace-specific strings
   (NSSs) is defined as an exact, but not case-sensitive, string match.

   Any identifier in device-id namespace can be compared using the
   normal mechanisms for percent-encoded UTF-8 strings.

   Conformance with URN Syntax: The string representation of the device
   identity URN and of the MEID sub namespace is fully compatible with
   the URN syntax.

   Validation Mechanism: The MEID can be validated using the mechanism
   defined in [S.R0048-A].

   Scope: device-id URN is global in scope.

5.  Specification for MEID Format

   The MEID format is 15 hexadecimal digits encoded in 8 octets as
   defined in [S.R0048-A].  The most significant digit is encoded in
   bits 4-1 of the octet 1.  Bits 5-8 of octet 1 are set to zero.  The
   least significant digit is encoded in bits 4-1 of the octet 8.

5.1.  Manufacturer Code

   The manufacturer code is an 8 hexadecimal digit value.  The
   manufacturer code identifies the mobile equipment manufacturer, and
   regional administration body of the mobile equipment.  The
   manufacturer code is chosen from a range of values allocated to the
   mobile equipment manufacturer in order to uniquely identify the
   mobile equipment.

5.2.  Serial Number

   The serial number is a 6 hexadecimal digit value.  The serial number
   identifies equipment within the manufacturer code.

5.3.  Check Digit

   This is a single hexadecimal digit (bits 1-4 of octet 8) and is used
   as assurance of integrity in error-prone operations, e.g. when used
   with certain types of readers during inventory management operations.
   The check digit is always set to zero when transmitted by the Mobile
   Equipment.

6.  Community considerations

   3GPP2 defined mobile equipment will be interoperating with internet
   devices for a variety of voice and data communication services.  To
   do this, they need to make use of internet protocols that will
   operate end to end between mobile equipments in 3GPP2 network and
   those in the general internet.  Many of these protocols require the
   use of URN's as identifiers.  Within the 3GGP2 defined networks,
   mobile equipment is identified by its MEID.  Internet users will need
   to be able to receive and include the device identity URN in various
   internet protocol elements to facilitate communication between pure
   internet based devices and 3GPP2 defined mobile equipments.  Thus,
   the existence and syntax of these namespaces needs to be available to
   the general internet community and the namespace needs to be
   registered with IANA in order to guarantee uniqueness and prevent
   potential namespace conflicts both within the internet and within
   3GPP2 defined networks.

7.  Namespace considerations

   A URN was considered the most appropriate URI to represent the MEID
   as this identifier may be used and transported similarly to the
   Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) which is defined as a URN in
   [RFC4122].  Since specifications for protocols that are used to
   transport device identifiers often require the device identifier to
   be globally unique and in the URN format, it is necessary that the
   URN formats are defined to represent the MEID.

8.  IANA considerations

   In accordance with BCP 66 [RFC3406], IANA is asked to register the
   Formal URN namespace "device-id" and URN sub namespace "meid" in the
   Registry of URN namespaces and sub namespaces, using the registration
   template presented in Section 3 of this document.

9.  Security considerations

   MEIDs (with the check digit) are displayable on most 3GPP2 mobile
   equipment; therefore, they must not be used as security capabilities
   such as identifiers whose mere possession grants access.

   The MEID is to be incorporated in a module which is contained within
   the mobile equipment.  The MEID SHALL not be changed after the mobile
   equipment's production process.  It SHALL resist tampering, i.e.
   manipulation and change, by any means (e.g. physical, electrical and
   software).
