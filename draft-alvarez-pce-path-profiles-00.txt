                   draft-alvarez-pce-path-profiles-00

Abstract

   This document describes extensions to the Path Computation Element
   (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP) to signal path profiles.  A
   stateful or stateless path computation element (PCE) can maintain an
   association between a set of path parameters and a profile.  A PCC
   can use the path profile to initiate a path computation request
   without having to specify a detailed list of path parameters.  In
   addition, a PCC can use the path profile to implement local policies
   associated with a path.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Path Profiles

   A path profile represents a list of path computation parameters or
   attributes that a PCE owns.  The PCC learns that association through
   the interaction with the PCE.  If the PCC initiates the path setup,
   it uses the path profile as part of the path computation request.  In
   its simplest form, the request will only include mandatory path
   request objects and a PATH-PROFILE object defined in Section 4.2.
   The PCE uses the path profile to identify the appropriate path
   computation parameters.  Then, it performs the path computation and
   sends a reply listing the detailed path parameters used.  If the PCE
   initiates the path setup, the PCE signals the path parameters and
   includes a PATH-PROFILE object to indicate the path profile id
   associated with the path.

3.  Procedures

3.1.  Capability Advertisement

   PCEP speakers advertise their capability to support path profiles
   during the session initialization phase.  They include the PATH-
   PROFILE-CAPABILITY TLV defined in Section 4.1 as part of the OPEN
   object.  A PCEP speaker can only signal a path profile if both
   speakers advertised this capability.  A speaker MUST send a PCErr
   message with Error-Type=4 (Not supported object), Error-value=1 (Not
   supported object class) and close the session if it receives a
   message with a path profile id, it supports the extensions in this
   document and both speakers did not advertise this capability.

3.2.  PCC-Initiated Paths

   A PCC MAY include a PATH-PROFILE object when sending a PCReq message.
   The PCE uses the path profile id to select the parameters to fullfil
   the request.  The means by which the PCC learns about a particular
   path profile id and decides to include it in a PCReq message are
   outside the scope of this document.  Similarly, the means by which
   the PCE selects a set of parameters based on the profile id for a
   specific request are outside the scope of this document.  The PCE may
   be stateful or stateless.

   A PCE may receive a path computation request with an unknown or
   invalid path profile id.  The PCE sends a PCErr message with Error-
   Type=[TBA] (PATH-PROFILE Error), Error-value=1 (Unknown path profile)
   if the path profile id is not known to the PCE.  The PCE sends a
   PCErr message with Error-Type=[TBA] (PATH-PROFILE Error), Error-
   value=2 (Invalid path profile) if the PCE knows about the path
   profile id, but considers the request invalid.  The profile may be
   invalid because of the path type, the PCEP session type or for the
   originating PCC.

   The PCE will determine whether to consider any additional optional
   objects included in a PCReq message based on policy.  As illustrated
   in Section 3.2.1 and Section 3.2.2, the PCC MAY include other
   optional objects along with a PATH-PROFILE object as part of a path
   computation request.  The PCC will use the processing-rule (P) flag
   in the common object header to signal whether it considers those
   objects mandatory or optional when the PCE performs path computation.
   Those objects may overlap with the path parameters that the PCE
   associates with the path profile id.

   PCE policy may place different kinds of restrictions on PCReq
   messages that include a PATH-PROFILE object and additional
   parameters.  A PCE MUST send an error message if it receives a

   request with optional objects signaled as mandatory (P flag = 1) for
   path computation and PCE policy does not allow such behavior from the
   originating PCC.  In that case, the PCE sends a PCErr message with
   Error-Type=[TBA] (PATH-PROFILE Error), Error-value=3 (Unexpected
   mandatory object).  If the objects are signaled as optional (P flag =
   0) for path computation, the PCE will decide based on policy whether
   to consider them or not.  When sending the PCRep message for the
   request, the PCE will use the ignore (I) flag in the common object
   header to indicate to the PCC whether an object was ignored.

3.2.1.  Point-to-Point Paths

   [RFC5440] defines the basic structure of a PCReq message for point-
   to-point paths.  This documents extends the message format as
   follows:

   <PCReq Message>::= <Common Header>
                      [<svec-list>]
                      <request-list>



   where:

      <svec-list>::=<SVEC>[<svec-list>]
      <request-list>::=<request>[<request-list>]

      <request>::= <RP>
                   <END-POINTS>
                   [<PATH-PROFILE>]
                   [<path-computation>]



   where:

   <path-computation> is the list of optional objects used for path
   computation as defined initially in [RFC5440] and modified in
   subsequent PCEP extensions.

   If present in a PCReq message, the PATH-PROFILE object MUST be the
   first optional object in the request portion of the message.

3.2.2.  Point-to-Multipoint Paths

   [RFC6006] defines the basic structure of a PCReq message for point-
   to-multipoint paths.  This documents extends the message format as
   follows:

3.3.  PCE-Initiated Paths

   A PCE MAY include a PATH-PROFILE object when sending a PCInitiate
   message as defined in [I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp].  The PCC
   can use the path profile id to select local behavior to apply to the
   path.  The means by which the PCE selects a profile id for a specific
   PCInitiate message are outside the scope of this document.
   Similarly, the means by which the PCC selects the local behavior to
   apply to a path based on a path profile id are outside the scope of
   this document.

   [I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] defines the basic structure of a
   PCInitiate message.  This documents extends the message format as
   follows:

   <PCInitiate Message> ::= <Common Header>
                               <PCE-initiated-lsp-list>
   Where:

     <PCE-initiated-lsp-list> ::= <PCE-initiated-lsp-request>
                                  [<PCE-initiated-lsp-list>]

     <PCE-initiated-lsp-request> ::= (<PCE-initiated-lsp-instantiation>|
                                      <PCE-initiated-lsp-deletion>)

     <PCE-initiated-lsp-instantiation> ::= <SRP>
                                           <LSP>
                                           <END-POINTS>
                                           <ERO>
                                           [PATH-PROFILE>
                                           [<attribute-list>]

     <PCE-initiated-lsp-deletion> ::= <SRP>
                                      <LSP>
