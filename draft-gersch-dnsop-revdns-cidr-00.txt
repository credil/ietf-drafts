         Reverse DNS Naming Convention for CIDR Address Blocks
                   draft-gersch-dnsop-revdns-cidr-00.txt

Abstract

   The current reverse DNS naming method is used to specify a complete
   IP address.  It has not been used to handle address ranges; for
   example, there is no formal mechanism for specifying a reverse DNS
   name for the block of addresses specified by the IPv4 prefix
   129.82.0.0/16.  Defining such a reverse DNS naming convention would
   be useful for a number of applications.  These include applications
   for secure BGP routing, and applications that need host-information
   for a device owning a complete IPv6 address block.  This draft
   proposes a naming convention for encoding CIDR address blocks in the
   reverse DNS.

Internet-Draft              Reverse DNS CIDR               February 2012


1.  Introduction

   This draft proposes a common naming convention for entering CIDR
   prefixes into the Reverse DNS.

   The Reverse DNS provides a naming convention for both IPv4 and IPv6
   addresses.  At this time, the primary use of the reverse-DNS is to
   associate an IP address with a PTR resource record that identifies
   the corresponding host name.  For example, IP address 129.82.138.2 is
   encoded as 2.138.82.129.in-addr.arpa and a PTR resource record
   identifies the host name as alpha.netsec.colostate.edu.  The Reverse
   DNS would become more powerful if it could also return information
   associated with a network address range, not just a unique IP
   address.  For example, one would like to store and resolve records
   associated with a prefix range such as 129.82.128/17.

   Given such a capability, a variety of new applications and services
   would be enabled.  For example, internet routing operators could
   publish authorized BGP route origins for their network address blocks
   in the reverse-DNS.  Another application could query for a set of
   host-names or services associated with an address block; for example,
   to indicate the authorized mail servers for an address block.

   Yet another interesting possibility is to solve a problem with IPv6
   dynamic DNS assignments.  In IPv4, the owner of address block could
   simply include one PTR record for every available address.  In fact,
   ISPs commonly pre-populate the reverse DNS zone for their customers.
   However, this approach clearly does not scale for IPv6 where the
   number of addresses becomes excessively large.  For example,
   allocation of a /48 (not uncommon in IPv6) includes 2^80 addresses
   and notes adding 1000 PTR records per second would require over 38
   trillion years to pre-populate the reverse DNS
   [I-D.howard-isp-ip6rdns].  The ability to name prefix blocks rather
   than individual addresses could help address this problem by
   publishing records associated with an entire IPv6 address range
   instead of replicating or synthesizing answers to unique address
   queries.

   The above list of possible applications is not intended to be
   complete, but instead suggest some of the possibilities.

1.1.  Purpose

   In order to enable these applications, one must map an IPv4 or IPv6
   prefix into a reverse-DNS name.  There are various subtleties,
   advantages and disadvantages that emerge when trying to define a
   naming convention.  Today, zone administrators can use their own
   individual approaches to encode a prefix in the reverse DNS.  This

Internet-Draft              Reverse DNS CIDR               February 2012


   requires no DNS protocol changes and no modifications to resolvers,
   caches, or authoritative servers.  The emergence of different
   encoding standards complicates (but does not prevent) the design of
   systems that would make use of these resource records.  The aim of
   this work is to introduce a standard convention.

1.2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used througt out the document:

   Reverse DNS:
      We use the term Reverse DNS to refer to the domains in-addr.arpa
      and ip6.arpa.

   Prefix:
      A prefix refers to IPv4 or IPv6 address range specified by a
      network portion and mask length, as described in [RFC4632].  For
      example, 129.82.0.0/16 and 129.82.128/18 are examples of IPv4
      prefixes.

   Octet Boundary:
      An IPv4 prefix falls on an octet boundary if its mask length is a
      multiple 8.  For example, 129.82.0.0/16 is on an octet boundary
      while 129.82.128/18 does not fall on octet boundary.  Prefixes
      that are on octet boundary naturally map to the reverse DNS.
      Prefixes that are not on octet boundary are more complex and the
      main challenge for any naming convention.

3.  Design Requirements

   A naming convention to specify CIDR address blocks in the reverse-DNS
   has several design goals:

   1.  Autonomy: The owner of a reverse-DNS zone file associated with a
       CIDR address block must be able to act independently from any
       other organization in order to create or modify data records
       within the DNS zone.

   2.  Coverage Authority: With the exception of data that has been sub-
       delegated to a child zone, the reverse DNS zone must be
       authoritative for all sub-prefixes below the covering prefix.
       Any query for a sub-prefix must be answered with a data record or
       NXDOMAIN specifying this zone as the authority.

   3.  Allow Delegation: It must allow the zone owner to delegate
       smaller address blocks to a child zone which will be
       independently managed.

   4.  Conformance: It should align with naming conventions and
       delegation structures already in use by the RIR's for IN-
       ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA.

   5.  Simplicity: The naming structure should be understandable, or at
       a minimum, able to be easily constructed by software provisioning
       tools and utilities such as DIG.

4.  Related Work

   The process of mapping CIDR addresses into the reverse-DNS name space
   is difficult because the prefix length of an IPv4 CIDR address is an
   arbitrary number from 0 to 32.  These numbers do not necessarily
   align with an IPv4 octet.

4.1.  CIDR Naming via RFC 2317

   Since CIDR address no longer align with octet boundaries, the CIDR
   specification in [RFC4632] notes that there is "some increase in work
   for those who maintain parts of the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone."  [RFC2317] is
   offered a technique to populate the IN-ADDR.ARPA.  The intent of this
   work is to encode IPv4 addresses and the approach is designed to
   "address spaces covering fewer than 256 addresses."

   Suppose organization A owns 129.82.138.0/30.  This address space
   covers four IPv4 addresses; namely 129.82.138.0, 129.82.138.1,
   129.82.138.2 and 129.82.138.3.  Giving organization A control of the
   reverse zone "138.82.129.in-addr.arpa." would allow Organization A to
   enter PTR resource records for each of its 4 addresses.  However, it
   also gives organization A the ability to enter PTR resource records
   for 252 other IP addresses from 129.82.138.4 to 129.82.138.255.
   These addresses are managed by other organizations.  Sharing the
   138.82.129.in-addr.arpa between multiple organization is not
   practical and creating a seperate zone for each IP address (e.g.
   creating the zone 0.138.82.129.in-addr.arpa) is very high overhead to
   store a single PTR record.

   [RFC2317] addresses this problem by creating CNAME records in
   138.82.129.in-addr.arpa zone.  Organization A administers a zone
   named 0/32.138.129.in-addr.arpa.  CNAME records in the 138.82.129.in-
   addr.arpa zone point to entries in Organization A's
   0/32.138.82.129.in-addr.arpa zone.  For example, 1.138.82.129.in-
   addr.arpa. is a CNAME pointing to 1.0/32.138.82.129.in-addr.arpa.  A
   full description is found in [RFC2317].

   This approach was not intended to encode IP address for address
   spaces smaller than a "/24".  It was not intended for encoding
   prefixes.  It does not specify how one might encode a prefix and it
   is not trivial to extend this approach to CIDR prefixes.  In
   particular, the design requirements of Coverage Authority, Allowing
   Delegation, and arguably Simplicity are not easily met by extending
   the RFC to included prefixes.

4.2.  Prior Work on CIDR Names for Routing

   Over a decade ago, [I-D.bates-bgp4-nlri-orig-verif] proposed to use
   the reverse DNS to verify the origin AS associated with a prefix.
   This requires both a naming convention for converting the name into a
   prefix and additional resource record types for storing origin
   information, along with recommendations on their use.

   Our focus in this draft is on the naming convention.  The draft
   extends [RFC2317] style names to encode a prefix.  For example, the
   draft proposes to encode the prefix 10.1.128/20 as the DNS name 128/
   20.1.10.bgp.in-addr.arpa.  This fails to meet the Coverage Authority
   requirement.  To see this, consider a more specific prefix such as
   10.1.128/21. 10.1.128/21 is encoded as 128/21.1.10.bgp.in-addr.arpa.

   The problem is that in CIDR terminology, 10.1.128/21 is covered by
   10.1.128/20.  But in the DNS structure, 10.1.128/20 and 10.1.128/21
   are siblings in the DNS tree structure.  This can be overcome by
   introducing a large number of CNAME records (one for every potential
   subprefix), but we seek an approach where the CIDR structure and DNS
   hierarchy align.

5.  Reverse DNS CIDR Name Specification

   The naming method described in this section is based on the well-
   known technique of ANDing a bit-mask with the low-order octet of an
   IP address.  The binary result is then broken up into individual sub-
   names using the "." separator.  The result looks like an ENUM or IPv6
   reverse-DNS address; that is, a string of chained empty non-terminal
   sub-names.

   This name-chaining creates the desired effect of being able to allow
   a DNS zone delegation at any point in the chain.  The naming scheme
   allows the creation of two /17's from a /16, two /18's from a /17,
   and so on.

5.1.  IPv4 Address Block Naming

   The CIDR to Reverse-DNS naming convention works as follows:

   1.  Invert the address per the usual reverse-DNS method.  Remove any
       trailing zeroes: 129.82.0.0/16 --> 82.129.in-addr.arpa.

   2.  Calculate N where N = prefix-length mod 8.  Stop If N equals 0.
       The name conversion is complete because you are at an octet
       boundary.  Otherwise:

   3.  Perform the following name construction:

       A.  Truncate the original name to remove the least significant
           non-zero octet.  Add ".m" characters to this string to
           indicate "mask".

       B.  Convert the least significant octet to binary, separating
           each digit with a "." character.

       C.  Truncate the binary digits to the N significant binary
           characters that correspond to the given prefix-length.

       D.  Reverse the string and add ".in-addr.arpa."

   Several examples will illustrate this algorithm.  These examples show
   the conversion to binary, followed by the truncation, followed by the
   name reversal.

           129.82.0.0/16   --> 82.129.in-addr.arpa. (at octet boundary)


           129.82.64.0/18  --> 129.82.m.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0
                           --> 129.82.m.0.1 (N = 18 mod 8 = 2)

                           --> 1.0.m.82.129.in-addr.arpa.


           129.82.64.0/20  --> 129.82.m.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0
                           --> 129.82.m.0.1.0.0  (N = 20 mod 8 = 4)
                           --> 0.0.1.0.m.82.129.in-addr.arpa.


           129.82.160.0/20 --> 129.82.m.1.0.1.0.0.0.0.0
                           --> 129.82.m.1.0.1.0 (N = 20 mod 8 = 4)
                           --> 0.1.0.1.m.82.129.in-addr.arpa.


           129.82.160.0/23 --> 129.82.m.1.0.1.0.0.0.0.0
                           --> 129.82.m.1.0.1.0.0.0.0 (N = 23 mod 8 = 7)
                           --> 0.0.0.0.1.0.1.m.82.129.in-addr.arpa.


           15.192.0.0/12   --> 15.192.m.1.1.0.0.0.0.0.0
                           --> 15.192.m.1.1.0.0    (N = 12 mod 8 = 4)
                           --> 0.0.1.1.m.15.in-addr.arpa.

   The conversion from a reverse-DNS name back to CIDR is simple.  First
   calculate the prefix length from the name using the formula:

           plen = 8*(count of full octets) + (count of binary digits)

   Then reverse the string, add up the values of the binary digits to
   build a final octet, then append a "/" and the prefix length.

   Examples:

           1.0.m.82.129.in-addr.arpa  --> 129.82.64.0/18
           (example has 2 octets + 2 binary digits, so mask length = 18)


           0.0.1.0.m.82.129.in-addr.arpa --> 129.82.64.0/20
           (example has 2 octets + 4 binary digits, so mask length = 20)


           0.0.0.1.0.1.m.129.in-addr.arpa--> 129.160.0/14
           (example has 1 octet + 6 binary digits, so mask length = 14)

5.2.  IPv4 Address Block Naming

   The IPv6 naming convention is similar, with the exception that 4-bit
   nibble boundaries are used instead of octets, the mod calculation is
   based on 4 instead of 8, and "ip6.arpa" is used as the suffix.

              (on nibble boundary)


           2607:fa88:8000:/33 --> 2.6.0.7.f.a.8.8.m.1.0.0.0
                              --> 2.6.0.7.d.a.8.8.m.1    (33 mod 4 = 1)
                              --> 1.m.8.8.a.f.7.0.6.2.ip6.arpa


           2607:fa88:e000:/35 --> 2.6.0.7.f.a.8.8.m.1.1.1.0
                              --> 2.6.0.7.d.a.8.8.m.1.1.1(35 mod 4 = 3)
                              --> 1.1.1.m.8.8.a.f.7.0.6.2.ip6.arpa

5.3.  Special Case to Allow "Overlapping Names" at Octet Boundaries

   In some instances it is desirable to create an "overlapping name" for
   a CIDR block located on an octet boundary.  For example, rather than
   spread information in 256 separate /24 zone files, it would be more
   convenient to put all the 256 records in one parent zone.  If an
   application is searching for data and does not find it in the /24
   zone it may optionally decide to look in the parent zone to see if an
   overlapping name exists and use that data instead.

   To construct an "overlapping name", use step 3 of the algorithm
   already described, skipping steps 1 and 2.  N will always equal 8 for
   IPv4 and will equal 4 for IPv6.  (Step 3C is not needed since there
   is nothing to truncate).

   Examples:

Appendix A.  Example Zone Files

A.1.  Example 1

   This example shows several DNS records added to an existing reverse-
   DNS zone file at octet boundary 129.82.0.0/16.  The records show how
   BGP route origins for a CIDR prefix could be specified in the zone
   file.  Otherwise no other changes were made.

   Note: this internet draft is not proposing the RRTypes for routing
   shown here; they are only presented as sample content for the
   proposed naming convention.

   Finally, the example shows a record for a /24 using the full 8-bit
   overlapping notation so that the data can be placed in this parent

   zone rather than in the child zone at 177.82.129.in-addr.arpa.

A.2.  Example 2

   This example illustrates the creation of a new zone for
   216.17.128.0/17 which is not at an octet boundary.

   The existing 256 zones delegated at IN-ADDR.ARPA for the range
   0.17.128 through 255.17.216.in-addr.arpa remain unchanged; they
   contain PTR records maintained by the appropriate zone owners

   Only a single new delegation needs to be added to IN-ADDR.ARPA:

           1.m.17.216.in-addr.arpa  NS   ns.frii.net

   This delegation refers to the new /17 zone and is not in conflict
   with any of the pre-existing /24 zones.

      ; no other delegations or PTR records are needed in this zone file

   In this example we have added several records all at the same domain
   name with information pertinent to address block 216.17.128.0/17.
