                Enhancement of CAPWAP Problem Statement
                      draft-shao-capwap-plus-ps-01

Abstract

   In recent widescale deployments of large public Wi-Fi networks, and
   in their integration with cellular networks EAP based authentication
   has been considered as a good candidate to making Wi-Fi user
   experience seamless similar to what it has been for cellular users.
   A few new functions which could enhance CAPWAP protocol have been
   identified in such deployments that can help improve the large scale
   carrier grade Wi-Fi networks.

Internet-Draft               CAPWAP Plus PS                 October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets continue to lead
   growth in internet traffic.  It is predicted that such growth will
   continue even with the deployment of LTE network.  Almost all mobile
   devices today are Wi-Fi enabled.  Public Wi-Fi services have lately
   been paid more attention for that reason to help bring this growth of
   cellular data traffic to a sustainable level.  Wi-Fi spectrum is free
   and globally available.  Because of capacity and coverage issues, LTE
   networks will continue to need public Wi-Fi network as a
   complementary technology.

   Recently industry efforts have been made to make Wi-Fi roaming as
   seamless as it is for cellular GSM networks by deploying EAP based
   authentication mechanism; Toward this end current CAPWAP protocol
   could be enhanced to help ease such deployments.

   There have been a number of proprietary implementations of the
   interface between Access Point (AP) and Access Controller (AC) and
   some of them provide capabilities which could be used to improve the
   Wi-Fi performance.  Once a standard interface is specified, the
   benefits for operators of standards based deployment will outweigh
   any benefits of past proprietary solutions.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Supporting EAP authencation in Wi-Fi network

   Current EAP message is designed to be transmitted in CAPWAP data
   Plane.  AC which is in the data path will act as the authenticator to
   transmit this EAP message to AAA server.  An operator may however
   prefer to bypass the AC for the user plane in order to improve the
   performance of AC and allow it to manage more APs when the network is
   growing.  In order to allow ACs to be bypassed for EAP messages, the
   CAPWAP control message could be extended to support EAP messages.

3.1.  Scenario Description

   The following figure shows where and how the problem arises.  In many
   operators networks.  The Access Controller is placed remotely at the
   central data center.  In order to avoid the traffic aggregation at
   the AC, the data plane out of the AP is directed to the Access Router

   (AR).  In this scenario, the CAPWAP-CTL tunnel and CAPWAP-DATA tunnel
   are separated from each other.

   Because there are no explicit message types to support the
   encapsulation of EAP packets in the CAPWAP-CTL tunnel, the EAP
   messages are tunneled via the CAPWAP-DATA plane to the AR.  AR acts
   as authenticator in the EAP framework.  After authentication, the AR
   receives the keying message for the session.  But AC is supposed to
   deliver these keying messages to the AP, and AR has no standard
   interface to ship them to the AP or the AC.  This is unacceptable in
   the scenario of EAP-based auto-authentication.
            CAPWAP-CTL +--------+
             ++========+   AC   |
            //         +--------+
           //
   +-----+//   CAPWAP-DATA           +--------------+
   | AP  |===========================| Access Router|
   +-----+                           +--------------+


         Figure 1: Split between CAPWAP-CTL and CAPWAP-DATA Plane

   So it is desirable to encapsulate EAP messages in the CAPWAP-CTL
   plane, to avoid data aggregation and improve WLAN system scalability.


4.  The Scope of Split and Local MAC mode

   There are 3 major categories has been specified by CAPWAP, the first
   is about Functions: such as "Distribution Service", "Integration
   Service", "Beacon Generation", "Probe Response Generation" "Power
   Mgmt/Packet Buffering", "Fragmentation/Defragmentation", and "Assoc/
   Disassoc/Reassoc"; the second is about QoS, such as, "Classifying",
   "Scheduling", and "Queuing"; the third is about RSN (WPA2) such as
   "IEEE 802.1X/EAP", "RSNA Key Management", and "IEEE 802.11
   Encryption/Decryption".  Even Split and Local MAC model has optional
   implementation, either at AP or AC, this lead to serious issue about
   Interoperation

   Proposing a specific mode about all this implementation will help
   interoperation among different vendors.


5.  802.11n support

   There are a couple of capabilities of 802.11n that need to be
   supported by CAPWAP control message such as radio capability, radio
   configuration and station information.



Shao, et al.             Expires April 25, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               CAPWAP Plus PS                 October 2012


   IEEE 802.11n standard was published in 2009 and it is an amendment to
   the IEEE 802.11-2007 standard to improve network throughput.  The
   maximum data rate increases to 600Mbit/s physical throughput rate.
   In the physical layer, 802.11n use OFDM and MIMO to achieve the high
   throughput. 802.11n use multiple antennas to form antenna array which
   can be dynamically adjusted to improve the signal strength and extend
   the coverage.

   802.11n support two modes of channel usage: 20MHz mode and 40Mhz
   mode.802.11n has a new feature called channel binding.  It can bind
   two adjacent 20MHz channel to one 40MHz channel to improve the
   throughput.If using 40Mhz channel configuration there will be only
   one non-overlapping channel in 2.4GHz.  In the large scale deployment
   scenario, operator need to use 20MHz channel configuration in 2.4GHz
   to allow more non-overlapping channels.

   In MAC layer, a new feature of 802.11n is Short Guard Interval(GI).
   802.11a/g use 800ns guard interval between the adjacent information
   symbols.  In 802.11n, the GI can be configured to 400nm under good
   wireless condition.

   Another feature in 802.11 MAC layer is Block ACK. 802.11n can use one
   ACK frame to acknowledge several MPDU receiving event.

   CAPWAP need to be extended to support the above new 802.11n features.
   For example, CAPWAP should allow the access controller to know the
   supported 802.11n features and the access controller should be able
   to configure the different channel binding modes.  One possible
   solution is to extend the CAPWAP information element for 802.11n.


6.  Channel auto reconfiguration

   Channel auto reconfiguration could imporve the Wi-Fi performance,
   CAPWAP message could be extended to support this function.

   Each channel may provide different quality of service, when WTP
   works.  WTP can be active or passive scanning and monitoring each
   channel, form the report of measurement results to the Access
   Controller.  WTP can periodically send configure status request to
   the AC.  According to the current channel quality and other channel
   quality scanning report, ACs decide whether modify the channel to be
   used, send the configure status response packet to set up a new
   channel for the WTP.

7.  Power auto reconfiguration

   Power auto reconfiguration could improve the Wi-Fi performance.
   CAPWAP message could be extended to achieve following outcome.

   o  Maximize Spectrum Usage: Real-world Wi-Fi deployments are
      depending on the features of shared media.  Three channels
      available in the 2.4GHz band and 23 channels in the 5GHz band.
      Power auto reconfiguration could help these channels be fully
      utilized.  As the results, clients could be distributed across all
      available channels.
   o  Reduce Interference: when multiple devices attempt to
      simutaneously access the same channel at the same time, a co-
      channel interference likely happned.  It reduces overall
      performance of the channel.  The reconfiguration via CAPWAP could
      efficiently mitigate the interference.  That is essential to
      proper network operation
   o  Optimize Coverage: Simply increasing AP power may not help to
      maximize converage because it creates an unbalanced condition in
      which more distantly located clients may perforIm poorly due to
      their lower transmit output power.  The power reconfiguration
      could achieve a balanced environment, where configuration could
      ensure that coverage is uniform and adequate throughout the
      service area.
