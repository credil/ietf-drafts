                      BGP Prefix Origin Validation
                    draft-ietf-sidr-pfx-validate-03

Abstract

   To help reduce well-known threats against BGP including prefix mis-
   announcing and monkey-in-the-middle attacks, one of the security
   requirements is the ability to validate the origination AS of BGP
   routes.  More specifically, one needs to validate that the AS number
   claiming to originate an address prefix (as derived from the AS_PATH
   attribute of the BGP route) is in fact authorized by the prefix
   holder to do so.  This document describes a simple validation
   mechanism to partially satisfy this requirement.

Internet-Draft        BGP Prefix Origin Validation          October 2011


1.  Introduction

   A BGP route associates an address prefix with a set of autonomous
   systems (AS) that identify the interdomain path the prefix has
   traversed in the form of BGP announcements.  This set is represented
   as the AS_PATH attribute in BGP [RFC4271] and starts with the AS that
   originated the prefix.  To help reduce well-known threats against BGP
   including prefix mis-announcing and monkey-in-the-middle attacks, one
   of the security requirements is the ability to validate the
   origination AS of BGP routes.  More specifically, one needs to
   validate that the AS number claiming to originate an address prefix
   (as derived from the AS_PATH attribute of the BGP route) is in fact
   authorized by the prefix holder to do so.  This document describes a
   simple validation mechanism to partially satisfy this requirement.

   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) describes an approach
   to build a formally verifyable database of IP addresses and AS
   numbers as resources.  The overall architecture of RPKI as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch] consists of three main components:

   o  A public key infrastructure (PKI) with the necessary certificate
      objects,

   o  Digitally signed routing objects,

   o  A distributed repository system to hold the objects that would
      also support periodic retrieval.

   The RPKI system is based on resource certificates that define
   extensions to X.509 to represent IP addresses and AS identifiers
   [RFC3779], thus the name RPKI.  Route Origin Authorizations (ROA)
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-format] are separate digitally signed objects that
   define associations between ASes and IP address blocks.  Finally the
   repository system is operated in a distributed fashion through the
   IANA, RIR hierarchy, and ISPs.

   In order to benefit from the RPKI system, it is envisioned that
   relying parties either at AS or organization level obtain a local
   copy of the signed object collection, verify the signatures, and
   process them.  The cache must also be refreshed periodically.  The
   exact access mechanism used to retrieve the local cache is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   Individual BGP speakers can utilize the processed data contained in
   the local cache to validate BGP announcements.  The protocol details
   to retrieve the processed data from the local cache to the BGP
   speakers is beyond the scope of this document (refer to
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr] for such a mechanism).  This document

Internet-Draft        BGP Prefix Origin Validation          October 2011


   proposes a means by which a BGP speaker can make use of the processed
   data in order to assign a "validity state" to each prefix in a
   received BGP UPDATE message.

   Note that the complete path attestation against the AS_PATH attribute
   of a route is outside the scope of this document.

   Although RPKI provides the context for this draft, it is equally
   possible to use any other database which is able to map prefixes to
   their authorized origin ASes.  Each distinct database will have its
   own particular operational and security characteristics; such
   characteristics are beyond the scope of this document.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Prefix-to-AS Mapping Database

   The BGP speaker loads validated objects from the cache into local
   storage.  The objects loaded have the content (IP address, prefix
   length, maximum length, origin AS number).  We refer to such a
   locally stored object colloquially as a "ROA" in the discussion below
   although we note that this is not a strictly accurate use of the
   term.

   We define several terms in addition to "ROA".  Where these terms are
   used, they are capitalized:

   o  Prefix: (IP address, prefix length), interpreted as is customary
      (see [RFC4632]).

   o  Route: Data derived from a received BGP UPDATE, as defined in
      [RFC4271], Section 1.1.  The Route includes one Prefix and an
      AS_PATH, among other things.

   o  ROA Prefix: The Prefix from a ROA.

   o  ROA ASN: The origin ASN from a ROA.

   o  Route Prefix: A Prefix derived from a route.

   o  Route Origin ASN: The origin AS number derived from a Route.  The
      origin AS number is the rightmost AS in the final segment of the
      AS_PATH attribute in the Route if that segment is of type

Internet-Draft        BGP Prefix Origin Validation          October 2011


      AS_SEQUENCE, or NONE if the final segment of the AS_PATH attribute
      is of any type other than AS_SEQUENCE.  No ROA can match an origin
      AS number of "NONE".  No Route can match a ROA whose origin AS
      number is zero.

   o  Covered: A Route Prefix is said to be Covered by a ROA when the
      ROA prefix length is less than or equal to the Route prefix length
      and the ROA prefix address matches the Route prefix address for
      all bits specified by the ROA prefix length.  (This is simply a
      statement of the well-known concept of determining a prefix
      match.)

   o  Matched: A Route Prefix is said to be Matched by a ROA when the
      Route Prefix is Covered by that ROA and in addition, the Route
      prefix length is less than or equal to the ROA maximum length and
      the Route Origin ASN is equal to the ROA ASN, keeping in mind that
      a ROA ASN of zero can never be matched, nor can a route origin AS
      number of "NONE".

   Given these definitions, any given BGP Route learned from an EBGP
   peer will be found to have one of the following "validation states":

   o  Not found: No ROA Covers the Route Prefix.

   o  Valid: At least one ROA Matches the Route Prefix.

   o  Invalid: At least one ROA Covers the Route Prefix, but no ROA
      Matches it.

   When a BGP speaker receives an UPDATE from one of its EBGP peers, it
   SHOULD perform a lookup as described above for each of the Routes in
   the UPDATE message.  The "validation state" of the Route SHOULD be
   set to reflect the result of the lookup.  Note that the validation
   state of the Route does not determine whether the Route is stored in
   the local BGP speaker's Adj-RIB-In.  This procedure SHOULD NOT be
   performed for Routes learned from peers of types other than EBGP.
   (Any of these MAY be overridden by configuration.)

   Use of the validation state is discussed in Section 3 and Section 5.

   We observe that a Route can be Matched or Covered by more than one
   ROA.  This procedure does not mandate an order in which ROAs must be
   visited; however, the "validation state" output is fully determined.

2.1.  Pseudo-Code

   The following pseudo-code illustrates the procedure above.  In case
   of ambiguity, the procedure above, rather than the pseudo-code,

           }
       }
       entry = next_lookup_result(pfx_validate_table, input.prefix);
   }

   //If pfx_validate_table contains one or more prefixes that
   //match the input, but none of them resulted in a "valid"
   //outcome since the origin_as did not match, return the
   //result state as "invalid". Else the initialized state of
   //"not found" applies to this validation operation.
   if (prefix_exists == TRUE) {
       result = BGP_PFXV_STATE_INVALID;
   }

   return (result);

3.  Policy Control

   An implementation MUST provide the ability to match and set the
   validation state of routes as part of its route policy filtering
   function.  Use of validation state in route policy is elaborated in
   Section 5.  For more details on operational policy considerations,
   see [I-D.ietf-sidr-origin-ops].


4.  Interaction with Local Cache

   Each BGP speaker supporting prefix validation as described in this
   document is expected to communicate with one or multiple local caches
   that store a database of RPKI signed objects.  The protocol
   mechanisms used to fetch the data and store them locally at the BGP
   speaker is beyond the scope of this document (please refer
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr]).  Irrespective of the protocol, the prefix
   validation algorithm as outlined in this document is expected to
   function correctly in the event of failures and other timing
   conditions that may result in an empty and/or partial prefix-to-AS
   mapping database.  Indeed, if the (in-PoP) cache is not available and
   the mapping database is empty on the BGP speaker, all the lookups
   will result in "not found" state and the prefixes will be advertised
   to rest of the network (unless restricted by policy configuration).
   Similarly, if BGP UPDATEs arrive at the speaker while the fetch
   operation from the cache is in progress, some prefix lookups will
   also result in "not found" state.  The implementation is expected to
   handle these timing conditions and MUST re-validate affected prefixes
   once the fetch operation is complete.  The same applies during any
   subsequent incremental updates of the validation database.

   In the event that connectivity to the cache is lost, the router
   should make a reasonable effort to fetch a new validation database
   (either from the same, or a different cache), and SHOULD wait until
   the new validation database has been fetched before purging the
   previous one.  A configurable timer MUST be provided to bound the
   length of time the router will wait before purging the previous
   validation database.


5.  Deployment Considerations

   Once a route is received from an EBGP peer it is categorized
   according the procedure given in Section 2.  Subsequently, routing
   policy as discussed in Section 3 can be used to take action based on
   the validation state.

   Policies which could be implemented include filtering routes based on

   validation state (for example, rejecting all "invalid" routes) or
   adjusting a route's degree of preference in the selection algorithm
   based on its validation state.  The latter could be accomplished by
   adjusting the value of such attributes as LOCAL_PREF.  Considering
   invalid routes for BGP decision process is a pure local policy matter
   and should be done with utmost care.

   In some cases (particularly when the selection algorithm is
   influenced by the adjustment of a route property that is not
   propagated into IBGP) it could be necessary for routing correctness
   to propagate the validation state to the IBGP peer.  This can be
   accomplished on the sending side by setting a community or extended
   community based on the validation state, and on the receiving side by
   matching the (extended) community and setting the validation state.

8.  IANA Considerations


9.  Security Considerations

   Although this specification discusses one portion of a system to
   validate BGP routes, it should be noted that it relies on a database
   (RPKI or other) to provide validation information.  As such, the
   security properties of that database must be considered in order to
   determine the security provided by the overall solution.  If
   "invalid" routes are blocked as this specification suggests, the
   overall system provides a possible denial-of-service vector, for
   example if an attacker is able to inject one or more spoofed records
   into the validation database which lead a good route to be declared
   invalid.  In addition, this system is only able to provide limited
   protection against a determined attacker -- the attacker need only
   prepend the "valid" source AS to a forged BGP route announcement in
   order to defeat the protection provided by this system.  This
   mechanism does not protect against "AS in the middle attacks" or
   provide any path validation.  It only attempts to verify the origin.
   In general, this system should be thought of more as a protection
   against misconfiguration than as true "security" in the strong sense.
