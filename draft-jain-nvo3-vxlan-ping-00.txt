1.  Introduction

   VXLAN [I-D.draft-mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan]is a tunneling mechanism
   to overlay Layer 2 networks on top of Layer 3 networks.  In most
   cases the end point of the tunnel (VTEP) is intended to be at the
   edge of the network, typically connecting an access switch to an IP
   transport network.  The access switch could be a physical or a
   virtual switch located within the hypervisor on the server which is
   connected to End System which is a VM.

   This document describes a mechanism that can be used to detect Data
   Plane failures and sanity of VXLAN Control and Data Plane for a given
   VXLAN Segment.

   There proposal describes:

   o  Information carried in VXLAN "Echo Request",

   o  Information carried in VXLAN "Echo Reply", and

   o  the mechanism to transport the "Echo Request" and "Echo Reply".

   The proposal defines the information to check correct operation of
   the Data Plane, as well as a mechanism to verify the Data Plane
   against the Control Plane for a given VXLAN Segment.

   Its is important consideration in this proposal to carry VXLAN Echo
   Request along same data path that normal VXLAN Packets would
   traverse.

   The tenants VM(s) are not aware of the Virtualization Overlays and as
   such the need for the verification of the Data Path MUST solely rest
   with the Cloud Provider.  The use cases where the Tenant VM(s) need
   to be aware of the Data Plane failures is beyond the scope of this
   document.

3.  Need for VXLAN Ping

   When a VXLAN Segment fails to deliver user traffic, there is a need
   to provide a tool that would enable users, as Cloud Providers to
   detect such failures, and a mechanism to isolate faults.  It may also
   be desirable to test the data path before mapping End System traffic
   to the VXLAN Segment.

   The basic idea is to facilitate following verifications:-

   o  Packets that are expected to go over a particular VXLAN Segment
      actually ends up going over the correct VXLAN Segment to the
      correct VXLAN Terminating VTEP.

   o  To verify the correct value of VXLAN VN-ID is programmed at
      Originating and Terminating VXLAN VTEP(s) for a given VXLAN
      Segment.

   To facilitate verification of the above requirements, this document
   proposes sending of a Packet (called an "VXLAN Echo Request") along
   the same data path as other Packets belonging to this Segment.  VXLAN
   Echo Request also carries information about the VXLAN Segment whose
   Data Path is to be verified.  This Echo Request is forwarded just
   like any other End System Data Packet belonging to that VXLAN
   Segment, as it contains the same VXLAN Encapsulation as regular End
   System's data which uses the given VXLAN Segment.

   On receiving VXLAN Echo Request at the end of the VXLAN Segment, it
   is sent to the Control Plane of the Terminating VTEP, which in-turn
   would respond with VXLAN Echo Reply.

                  Value What it means
                  ----- ---------------------------------
                  1     Do not reply

                  2     Reply via an IPv4/IPv6 UDP Packet

   VXLAN Echo Request with 1 (Do not reply) in the Reply Mode field may
   be used for one-way connectivity tests; the receiving node may log
   gaps in the Sequence Numbers and/or maintain delay/jitter statistics.
   For normal operation VXLAN Echo Request would have 2 (Reply via an
   IPv4 UDP Packet) in the Reply Mode field.

   The Originator's Handle is filled in by the Originator, and returned
   unchanged by the receiver in the Echo Reply (if any).  There value
   used for this field can be implementation dependent, this MAY be used
   by the Originator for matching up requests with replies.

   The Sequence Number is assigned by the sender of the VXLAN echo
   request and can be (for example) used to detect missed replies.

   The TimeStamp Sent is the time-of-day (in seconds and microseconds,
   according to the sender's clock) in NTP format [NTP] when the VXLAN
   Echo Request is sent.  The TimeStamp Received in an Echo Reply is the
   time-of-day (according to the receiver's clock) in NTP format that
   the corresponding Echo Request was received.

   TLVs (Type-Length-Value tuples) have the following format:


        0                   1                   2                   3

6.  Procedure for VXLAN Ping

   VXLAN Echo Request is used to test Data Plane and its view of Control
   Plane for particular VXLAN Segment.  The VXLAN Segment to be verified
   is identified by the "VN-ID".  For the Data Plane verification, the
   complete VXLAN Echo Request Packet would be encapsulated with the
   VXLAN header of the given VXLAN Segment.  For control plane's view of
   the given VXLAN Segment at the Terminating VTEP, the TLV will be
   encoded under Echo Request Packet, to identify presence of given
   VXLAN Segment.

   When VXLAN Echo Request is received, the Terminating VTEP is expected
   to verify the consistency of the Control Plane and Data Plane for the
   VXLAN Segment identified by the VN-ID.

6.1.  Sending VXLAN Echo Request

   Inner Ethernet Header for the VXLAN Echo Request Packet should have
   the Destination Mac set to 00-00-5E-90-XX-XX (to be assigned IANA);
   the Source Mac is set to Mac Address of the Originating VTEP.  In the
   payload portion of this VXLAN Frame.  The IP header is set as
   follows: the source IP Address is a routable Address of the sender;
   the destination IP Address is a (randomly chosen) IPv4 Address from
   the range 127/8, IPv6 addresses are chosen from the range 0:0:0:0:0:
   FFFF:127/104.  The IP TTL is set to 255.  The UDP header is set as
   follows: the source UDP port is chosen by the sender.  It is desired
   to choose the Source UDP port so as to exercise the entropy for ECMP/
   load balancing across the VXLAN Overlay, and it left to the
   implementation; the destination UDP port is set to xxxx (assigned by
   IANA for VXLAN Echo Requests).  The rest of the Echo Request is
   encoded as define in above section "Packet Format", VN-ID in the TLV
   for Echo Request MUST be same as the VN-ID for the VXLAN Segment.
   The IPv4 Sender Address is set to the Address of Originating VTEP's
   IP Address.  The VXLAN Router Alert option
   [I-D.draft-singh-nvo3-vxlan-router-alert] MUST be set in the VXLAN
   header as shown below.  A VXLAN Echo Request is sent encapsulated
   with the VXLAN header corresponding to the VXLAN Segment being
   tested.

    VXLAN Header:
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |R|R|R|R|I|R|R|RA|           Reserved                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) |   Reserved    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       RA: Router Alter Bit (Proposed)

   The sender chooses a Originator's Handle and a Sequence Number.  When
   sending subsequent VXLAN Echo Requests, the sender SHOULD increment
   the Sequence Number by 1.

   The TimeStamp Sent is set to the time-of-day (in seconds and
   microseconds) that the Echo Request is sent.  The TimeStamp Received
   is set to zero.  Also, the Reply Mode must be set to the desired
   reply mode.  The Return Code and Subcode are set to zero.

6.2.  Receiving VXLAN Echo Request

   At the Terminating VTEP, sending VXLAN Echo Request to the Control
   Plane is triggered by one of the following Packet processing
   exceptions: VXLAN Router Alert option,
   [I-D.draft-singh-nvo3-vxlan-router-alert] the Inner Destination MAC
   Address of 00-00-5E-90-XX-XX as defined in above section, and the
   Destination IP Address in the 127/8 Address range for IPv4 Address,
   or 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:127/104 for IPv6 Address.  The Control Plane
   further identifies the VXLAN Echo Request by UDP destination port
   xxxx.

   Once the VXLAN Echo Request Packed is identified at Control Plane, it
   is processed as follows:-

   o  General Packet sanity is verified.  If the Packet is not well-
      formed, VTEP SHOULD send VXLAN Echo Reply with the Return Code set
      to "Malformed Echo Request received" and the Subcode to zero.  The
      header fields Originator's Handle, Sequence Number, and Timestamp
      Sent are not examined, but are included in the VXLAN Echo Reply
      message

   o  VNI Validation: If there is no entry for VN-ID, it indicates that
      there could be a transient or permanent disconnect between Control
      Plane and data palne and VTEP needs to report an error with Return
      Code of "No VN-ID Present" and a Return Subcode of Zero.  If the
      mapping exists then send VXLAN Echo Reply with a Return Code of
      "Return-Code-OK", and a Return Subcode of Zero.  The procedures
      for sending the Echo Reply are found in subsection below section.

6.3.  Sending VXLAN Echo Reply

   VXLAN Echo Reply is a UDP Packet.  It MUST ONLY be sent in response
   to VXLAN Echo Request.  The Source IP Address is a routable Address
   of the replier; the source port is the well-known UDP port for VXLAN
   ping.  The Destination IP Address and UDP port are copied from the
   Source IP Address and UDP port of the Echo Request.  The IP TTL is
   set to 255.

Internet-Draft       Detecting VXLAN Segment Failure           June 2013


   The format of the Echo Reply is the same as the Echo Request.  The
   Originator Handle, the Sequence Number, and TimeStamp Sent are copied
   from the Echo Request; the TimeStamp Received is set to the time-of-
   day that the Echo Request is received (note that this information is
   most useful if the time-of-day clocks on the requester and the
   replier are synchronized).The replier MUST fill in the Return Code
   and Subcode, as determined in the previous subsection.

6.4.  Receiving VXLAN Echo Reply

   An Originating VTEP should only receive VXLAN Echo Reply in response
   to an VXLAN Echo Request that it sent.  Thus, on receipt of VXLAN
   echo reply, Originating VTEP should parse the Packet to ensure that
   it is well-formed, then attempt to match up the Echo Reply with an
   Echo Request that it had previously sent, using the destination UDP
   port and the Originator Handle.  If no match is found, then VTEP
   should drop the Echo Reply Packet; otherwise, it checks the Sequence
   Number to see if it matches.

10.  IANA Considerations

   Action-1: This specification reserves a IANA UDP Port Number to be
   used when sending the VXLAN Echo Request Packet.

   Action-2: This specification reserves a IANA Ethernet unicast Address
   for VXLAN Exception handling.  This Address needs to be reserved from
   the block.  "IANA Ethernet Address block - Unicast Use"
