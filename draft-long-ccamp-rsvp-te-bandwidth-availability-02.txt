Abstract 

   Packet switching network may contain links with variable bandwidth, 
   e.g., copper, radio, etc. The bandwidth of such link is sensitive to 
   external environment. Availability is typically used for describing 
   the link during network planning. This document describes an 
   extension for RSVP-TE signaling for setting up a label switching 
   path (LSP) in a Packet Switched Network (PSN) network which contains 
   links with discretely variable bandwidth by introducing an optional 
   availability field in RSVP-TE signaling.

1. Introduction 

   The RSVP-TE specification [RFC3209] and GMPLS extensions [RFC3473] 
   specify the signaling message including the bandwidth request for 
   setting up a label switching path in a PSN network. 

   Some data communication technologies allow seamless change of 
   maximum physical bandwidth through a set of known discrete values. 
   For example, in mobile backhaul network, microwave links are very 
   popular for providing connection of last hops. In case of heavy rain, 
   to maintain the link connectivity, the microwave link may lower the 
   modulation level since demodulating lower modulation level need 
   lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This is called adaptive 
   modulation technology [EN 302 217]. However, lower modulation level 
   also means lower link bandwidth. When link bandwidth reduced because 
   of modulation down-shifting, high priority traffic can be maintained, 
   while lower priority traffic is dropped. Similarly the cooper links 
   may change their link bandwidth due to external interference.  

   The parameter, availability [G.827, F.1703, P.530], is often used to 
   describe the link capacity during network planning. Assigning 
   different availability classes to different types of service over 
   such kind of links provides more efficient planning of link capacity. 
   To set up a LSP across these links, availability information is 
   required for the nodes to verify bandwidth satisfaction and make 
   bandwidth reservation. The availability information should be 
   inherited from the availability requirements of the services 
   expected to be carried on the LSP, voice service usually needs ''five 
   nines'' availability, while non-real time services may adequately 
   perform at four or three nines availability. Since different service 
   types may need different availabilities guarantee, multiple 
   <availability, bandwidth> pairs may be required when signaling.  

   To fulfill LSP setup by signaling in these scenarios, this document 
   specifies a new availability sub-TLV as the sub-TLV of Ethernet 
   bandwidth profiles [RFC6003]. Multiple bandwidth profiles with 
   different availability can be carried in the SENDER_TSPEC object.

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE - Bandwidth Availability        October 2013 
    

2. Overview 

   A PSN tunnel may span one or more links in a network. To setup a 
   label switching path (LSP), a PE node may collect link information 
   which is spread in routing message, e.g., OSPF TE LSA message, by 
   network nodes to get to know about the network topology, and 
   calculate out an LSP route based on the network topology, and send 
   the calculated LSP route to signaling to initiate a PATH/RESV 
   message for setting up the LSP. 

   In case that there is(are) link(s) with variable discrete bandwidth 
   in a network, a <bandwidth, availability> requirement list should be 
   specified for an LSP. Each <bandwidth, availability> pair in the 
   list means that listed bandwidth with specified availability is 
   required. The list could be inherited from the results of service 
   planning for the LSP. 

   When a PE node initiates a PATH/RESV signaling to set up an LSP, the 
   PATH message SHOULD carry the <bandwidth, availability> requirement 
   list as bandwidth request.  Intermediate node(s) will allocate the 
   bandwidth resource for each availability requirement from the 
   remaining bandwidth with corresponding availability. An error 
   message may be returned if any <bandwidth, availability> request 
   cannot be satisfied. 

   If there is a hop that cannot support the availability sub-TLV, the 
   availability sub-TLV is ignored, and the requirement will be treated 
   as the highest availability.

         This field is defined as a bit vector of binary flags. In RFC 
         6003, the following flags are defined:

            Flag 2 (bit 1): Color Mode (CM)

         A new flag is defined in this document: 

            Flag 3 (bit 2): Availability Flag (AF) 

     Index: 8 bits 

     CIR (Committed Information Rate): 32 bits

     EBS (Excess Burst Size): 32 bits 

       See [RFC6003] section 4.1. 

      When the Flag 3 is set to value 1, there is an availability sub-
      TLV included in this Bandwidth Profile TLV. When the Flag 3 is set 
      to value 0, there won't be an availability sub-TLV. The 
      availability sub-TLV has the following format:

   SENDER_TSPEC object. Each Bandwidth Profile TLV specifies the 
   portion of bandwidth request with referred availability requirement. 

   The destination node checks whether it can satisfy the bandwidth 
   requirements by comparing each bandwidth requirement inside the 
   SENDER_TSPEC objects with the remaining link sub-bandwidth resource 
   with respective availability guarantee when received the PATH 
   message.  

     o   If all bandwidth requirements can be satisfied, it should 
        reserve the bandwidth resource from each remaining sub-
        bandwidth portion to set up this LSP. Optionally, the higher 
        availability bandwidth can be allocated to lower availability 
        request when the lower availability bandwidth cannot satisfy 
        the request. 

     o   If at least one bandwidth requirement cannot be satisfied, it 
        should generate PathErr message with the error code "Admission 
        Control Error" and the error value "Requested Bandwidth 
        Unavailable" (see [RFC2205]). 

4. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce new security considerations to the    
   existing RSVP-TE signaling protocol. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   IANA maintains registries and sub-registries for RSVP-TE used by 
   GMPLS. IANA is requested to make allocations from these registries 
   as set out in the following sections.  

5.1 RSVP Objects Class Types 

   This document introduces two new Class Types for existing RSVP 
   objects. IANA is requested to make allocations from the "Resource 
   ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters" registry using the "Class 
   Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types" sub-registry.

5.2 Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLV 

   IANA maintains a registry of GMPLS parameters called ''Generalized 
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters''. 

   IANA has created a new sub-registry called ''Ethernet Bandwidth 
   Profiles'' to contain bit flags carried in the Ethernet Bandwidth 
   Profile TLV of the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object. 

   Bits are to be allocated by IETF Standards Action. Bits are numbered 
   from bit 0 as the low order bit. A new bit flag is as follow: 

   Bit     Hex               Description              Reference 

   ---     ----              ------------------       ----------- 

   2       0x03              Availability Flag (AF)   [This ID] 

   Sub-TLV types for Ethernet Bandwidth Profiles are to be allocated by 
   IETF Standard Action. Initial values are as follows: 

   Type    Length            Format                   Description
