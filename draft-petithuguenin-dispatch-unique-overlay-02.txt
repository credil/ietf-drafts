Internet-Draft           Infrastructure Overlay               March 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RELOAD] is a peer to peer protocol developed by the P2PSIP Working
   Group.  Each RELOAD instance has a unique name, which is used by the
   process in section 10.2 of this specification to find the
   configuration servers, enrollment servers and bootstrap servers
   needed to join the overlay.  The process assumes that the RELOAD
   instance name is a FQDN, and uses the process in [RFC2782] (SRV RR)
   to find the IP address of the HTTPS server that serves the
   configuration document for this overlay.

   This process is adequate when the management of the overlay does not
   need to be distinguished from the owner of the FQDN used as the
   instance name, which is the case most of the time.  But there is a
   special class of overlays that, by definition, requires to be unique
   on the Internet and for which having the possibility of create
   instances would defeat their very purpose.  This specification calls
   the kind of overlays that are not domain specific, but application
   specific "infrastructure overlays".

1.1.  VIPR Infrastructure Overlay

   [VIPR] is a technology that is being standardized in the VIPR Working
   Group and that aims to build bridges between SIP islands by
   automatically provision SIP routes after the "ownership" of a PSTN
   phone number has been verified by an actual PSTN phone call.  This
   technology uses an RELOAD overlay as a distributed database where
   mappings between phone numbers and servers responsible for the
   validation process are stored.  The promise of VIPR to bridge these
   SIP islands cannot be fulfilled if there is more than one distributed
   database storing these mappings.

1.2.  Bitcoin-like Infrastructure Overlay

   The existing Bitcoin [1] protocol is using an IRC channel to find the
   initial peer servers, but one can imagine a Bitcoin-like Internet
   currency that built on top of RELOAD.  If such Internet currency is
   ever implemented on top of RELOAD, it would also require a unique
   RELOAD instance.

1.3.  BOINC-like Infrastructure Overlay

   BOINC [2] is a software for volunteer computing and grid computing,
   which is used for donating computer resources for projects as diverse
   as SETI@Home, Malariacontrol.net and LHC@Home.  This kind of research
   benefiting humanity as a whole could probably be better served if
   implemented on a unique overlay.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Requirements

   The following requirements can be identified as a starting point for
   the discussion about infrastructure overlays:

   REQ-1:  The mechanism used to find the configuration servers of the
      infrastructure overlay MUST require as little administrative
      overhead as possible.
   REQ-2:  The mechanism MUST NOT require that one entity must shoulder
      the burden for administratively supporting the overlay.
   REQ-3:  The mechanism MUST ensure that no one can capture the overlay
      for its own gain.


4.  Security Considerations

   TBD


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.


6.  Acknowledgements

   with Jon Peterson providing some of the ideas.

Appendix A.  Proposal

   One possible way to implement infrastructure overlay is to do
   something similar to [RFC3404] and [RFC3405], by defining a .arpa
   subdomain named "reload".  The overlay name as defined in a standard
   track document then becomes a subdomain of "reload.arpa.", so if for
   instance the name of an infrastructure overlay is "Quetzalcoatl", the
   standard track document defining this overlay is also a request to
   create a "Quetzalcoatl.reload.arpa." domain.

   Because there is no way to clearly differentiate between a standard
   overlay and an infrastructure overlay simply by looking at the
   instance-name, especially since ICANN accepts applications for new
   top-level domains, this proposal would also redefine the reload URI

   in section 13.15 of [RELOAD], by prepending a '&' symbol to the name
   of the overlay to signal that the name following the symbol is the
   name of an infrastructure overlay.  A RELOAD implementation
   supporting infrastructure overlay can then use the procedure defined
   in [RELOAD] section 10.2 by using the "reload.arpa." subdomain
   instead of the instance name directly.


Appendix B.  Release notes

   This section must be removed before publication as an RFC.

B.1.  Modifications between -02 and -01

   o  The proposal cares about the RELOAD URI, not the instance-name in
      the configuration file.

B.2.  Modifications between -01 and -00

   o  Added a proposal.
