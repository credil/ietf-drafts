Abstract

   Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP) defined
   in [RFC 5440] states that "All PCEP messages MUST be sent using the
   registered TCP port for the source and destination TCP port."  This
   has however lead to a lot of restrictions for the implementation.
   With these considerations in mind this document updates the TCP
   behavior.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

Internet-Draft        PCEP TCP port number changes           August 2011


1.  Introduction

   PCEP defined in [RFC 5440] uses TCP as the transport protocol to
   transfer all PCEP messages.  The PCEP specification states that:

   "All PCEP messages MUST be sent using the registered TCP port for the
   source and destination TCP port."

   However as PCEP can be used as communication between PCEP clients and
   servers as well as between servers.  This has caused issues in
   implementations on various platforms, besides most implementations do
   not follow the same behavior.  It is with this background that an
   alternate reccomendation is given here.


2.  TCP Port changes

   PCEP listens on PCE TCP port (4189).  The restriction of the source port
   to be the same has been removed.  This allows the requirements of
   reliable messaging and flow control to be met without further
   protocol work.

   The protocol needs to take care that there is only one request from a
   particular client, to prevent any DoS attacks, that may occur.


3.  IANA Considerations

   No new IANA consideration are raised by this document.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues.


5.  Acknowledgements
