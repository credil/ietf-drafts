1.  Introduction

   The BGP Graceful Restart [RFC4724] process defines a mechanism that a
   restarting router can use with its non-restarting peers.  The
   existence of other restarting routers results in the use of the base
   route exchange mechanism [RFC4271] with them, even if the forwarding
   state has indeed been preserved for (and by) those peers during the
   restart.  As a result, traffic forwarding between restarting routers
   is disrupted.

   This document defines an extension to BGP Graceful Restart that
   reduces the negative impact of multiple inter-connected restarting
   routers.  The proposed mechanism does not require any changes to the
   BGP protocol.

   The current process [RFC4724] states that routes from restarting
   peers are to be removed from the local forwarding state when the non-
   restarting peers converge (the End-of-RIB marker is received from all
   of them).  Assuming a simple topology:

      NR1 - R2 - R3 - NR4

      where NRx are non-restarting routers, Rx are restarting routers
      and the lines between them represent BGP sessions.

   There are two types of routes affected (from R2's point of view) by
   the current process:

   1.  Routes that are only reachable through R3.  These routes will be
       removed from the forwarding table when the non-restarting routers
       converge, and installed back in when the convergence with R3 is
       done.

   2.  Routes that are reachable through both R3 and NR1.  These routes
       will first change to NR1 when the non-restarting routers
       converge, and later back to R3 (assuming that is in fact still
       the preferred path).

   Both types can clearly cause disruption in traffic forwarding, micro-
   loops, traffic loss, etc.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Proposed Solution

   The extension proposed to BGP Graceful Restart to accommodate for
   multiple restarting routers, when the forwarding state has been
   preserved between them, is simply to delay sending the End-of-RIB
   marker to non-restarting routers.

   Specifically, to allow a restarting router the ability to reduce the
   impact due to other restarting routers, the following paragraph is
   added as the fifth one in section 4.1 (Procedures for the Restarting
   Speaker) [RFC4724]:

      Before updating the corresponding forwarding states, the BGP
      speaker MAY advertise the Adj-RIB-Out to the remaining peers (ones
      with the "Restart State" bit set in the received capability and
      ones that do not advertise the graceful restart capability),
      including the End-of-RIB marker, and MAY wait for the
      corresponding End-of-RIB marker from the restarting ones.

   During the recovery period of multiple restarting routers, a BGP
   speaker may advertise routing information that is not being used at
   the time.  Because the forwarding state of the speakers remains
   unchanged (from that at the restart), it is clear that this
   transitive property of sharing routing information between restarting
   routers doesn't cause any issues in the actual forwarding of traffic.
   Furthermore, it has the advantage if avoiding further disruptions in
   the forwarding of traffic through the restarting routers.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document proposes an extension to an existing mechanism.  The
   same security considerations explained there apply to this extension.

   The propagation of routing information that is not in use may cause
   forwarding looks and an inconsistent state in a network.  However,
   the risk in this document is mitigated by the fact that the
   information is validated by all peers once the convergence process
   completes.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
