    RSVP-TE Recovery Extension for data plane initiated reversion, 
             protection timer and SNC options signalling
                 draft-takacs-ccamp-revertive-ps-07

Abstract

   RSVP-TE recovery extensions are specified in [RFC4872] and
   [RFC4873].  Currently recovery signalling does not support the
   request for revertive protection, recovery timers values, and
   sub-network connection (SNC) protection options. This document 
   extends the PROTECTION Object format allowing sub-TLVs, and 
   defines three sub-TLVs to carry wait-to-restore and hold-off 
   intervals and SNC protection options.

1.  Introduction

   Generalised MPLS (GMPLS) extends MPLS to include support for
   different switching technologies [RFC3471].  These switching
   technologies provide several protection schemes [RFC4426][RFC4427]
   (e.g. 1+1, 1:N, M:N).  Many characteristics of those protection
   schemes are common disregard of the switching technology (e.g.  TDM,
   LSC, etc).  GMPLS RSVP-TE signalling has been extended to support the
   various protection schemes and establish connections (Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs)) configuring its specific protection characteristics
   [RFC4426][RFC4872].

   Currently RSVP-TE extensions do not address the configuration of
   protection switching timers.  It also does not provide information on
   the protection switching operation mode (i.e., revertive or non-
   revertive) and sub-network connection (SNC) protection options.

   The Hold-off time (HOFF) is defined as the time between the reporting
   of signal fail or degrade, and the initialization of the recovery
   switching operation [RFC4427].  This timer is useful to limit the
   number of switch actions when multiple layers of recovery are being
   used, or in case of 1+1 unidirectional protection scheme [G.808.1] to
   prevent too early switching due to the differential delay 
   between the short and long path.

   The Wait-to-Restore time (WTR) is defined as a period of time that
   must elapse after a recovered fault before an LSP can be used again
   to transport the normal traffic and/or to select the normal traffic
   from the LSP [RFC4427].  The WTR time is fundamental in revertive
   mode of operation, to prevent frequent operation of the protection
   switch due to an intermittent defect [G.808.1].

   Reversion refers to the process of moving normal traffic back to the
   original working LSP after the failure is cleared and the path is
   repaired [RFC4426][RFC4427][RFC4872].  In transport networks
   reversion is desirable since the protection path may not be optimal
   from a routing and resource consumption point of view, additionally,
   moving traffic back to the working LSP allows the protection
   resources to be used to protect other LSPs.  On the other hand,
   reversion requires that the working resources remain allocated during
   failure.  The operator needs to have the choice between revertive and
   non-revertive protection to balance the pros and cons in a given
   situation.

   WTR and HOFF timers and SNC protection options must be accurately
   configured at both ends of the LSP.  Operators may need to tune WTR
   and HOFF timers on a per LSP basis to ensure best protection
   switching performance (e.g., account for differential delays between

   worker and protection paths).  Currently these values are either pre-
   configured to a default value (and so may be suboptimal for some of
   the LSPs) or need to be manually set/tuned after the connections have
   been established.  Since these parameters are important for recovery
   in transport networks, it is desirable that GMPLS RSVP-TE protection
   signalling carries the necessary information.

   This document extends the PROTECTION Object format allowing sub-TLVs,
   and defines three sub-TLVs to carry WTR and HOFF timer values and SNC
   protection options.

2.  Updated PROTECTION Object format and sub-TLVs

   In [RFC4872] and [RFC4873] the PROTECTION object is specified to
   support end-to-end and segment recovery.  In order to ease addition
   of protection attributes the PROTECTION Object is extended to carry
   sub-TLVs.  The new format updates the PROTECTION Object format of
   C-Type 2.  The updated format is depicted below.  IANA is requested
   to maintain the TLV space for the PROTECTION Object.

   We retained C-Type to ensure that nodes not capable of interpreting
   the new format (sub-TLVs) will still be able to process the object
   without being required to generate an error; while nodes recognising
   the new format will process the TLVs accordingly.  The processed sub-
   TLV MUST be included in the PROTECTION Object sent in the Resv
   message upstream, to ensure that the sender can maintain a consistent
   view of the actual protection configuration of the LSP.

   Mode field (3 bits): The mode values are defined as follows:

   Reserved field (29 bits): This field is reserved for future use.  It

   In the case of end-to-end protection the PROTECTION Object is

   options sub-TLVs correspond to the end-to-end protection.  In the
   case when a segment of the LSP is to be protected and the WTR and
   HOFF timers and SNC protection optoins for the protection segment are
   to be set by signalling, explicit segment recovery control has to be
   used, i.e., the PROTECTION Object with the desired timers set must be
   inserted in the appropriate Secondary Explicit Route Object (SERO).

3.  Error handling

   In the case a specific configuration of the timers or SNC option is 
   not supported the corresponding error should be generated and sent 
   in the PathErr message: "Routing Problem/Unsupported WTR value" or 
   "Routing Problem/Unsupported HOFF value" or "Routing Problem/
   Unsupported SNC protection mode".

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1. New TLV space for the PROTECTION object

   A new TLV space needs to be opened and maintained for the PROTECTION
   Object in the "Class Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types "
   Registry.

4.3. New RSVP error sub-code 

   For Error Code = 24 "Routing Problem" (see [RFC3209]) the following 
   sub-codes are defined.

      Sub-code                 	 	Value
      --------                       	-----

      Unsupported WTR value 		To be assigned by IANA 
					(suggest value: 80)

      Unsupported HOFF value 		To be assigned by IANA 
					(suggest value: 81)

      Unsupported SNC protection mode	To be assigned by IANA 
					(suggest value: 82)
