 An IPv6 Distributed Client Mobility Management approach using existing
                               mechanisms
                      draft-bernardos-dmm-cmip-00

Abstract

   The use of centralized mobility management approaches -- such as
   Mobile IPv6 -- poses some difficulties to operators of current and
   future networks, due to the expected large number of mobile users and
   their exigent demands.  All this has triggered the need for
   distributed mobility management alternatives, that alleviate
   operators' concerns allowing for cheaper and more efficient network
   deployments.

   This draft describes a possible way of achieving a distributed
   mobility behavior with Client Mobile IP, based on Mobile IPv6 and the
   use of Cryptographic Generated Addresses.

1.  Introduction

   Most of the currently standardized IP mobility solutions, like Mobile
   IPv6 [RFC6275], or Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] rely to a certain
   extent on a centralized mobility anchor entity.  This centralized
   network node is in charge of both the control of the network entities
   involved in the mobility management (i.e., it is a central point for
   the control signalling), and the user data forwarding (i.e., it is
   also a central point for the user plane).  This makes centralized
   mobility solutions prone to several problems and limitations, as
   identified in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements]: longer (sub-optimal)
   routing paths, scalability problems, signaling overhead (and most
   likely a longer associated handover latency), more complex network
   deployment, higher vulnerability due to the existence of a potential
   single point of failure, and lack of granularity on the mobility
   management service (i.e., mobility is offered on a per-node basis,
   not being possible to define finer granularity policies, as for
   example per-application).

   There are basically two main approaches that are being researched
   now: one aimed at making Mobile IPv6 work in a distributed way, and
   another one doing the same exercise for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (see the
   document [I-D.ietf-dmm-best-practices-gap-analysis]).  In this draft
   we describe a solution to achieve a DMM behavior with a CMIP (MIPv6)
   solution.  This document is based on a research paper of the same
   authors, called "Flat Access and Mobility Architecture: an IPv6
   Distributed Client Mobility Management solution" [GOB+11].

   DAR (Distributed Anchor Router).  First hop routers where the mobile
      nodes attach to.  They also play the role of mobility managers for
      the IPv6 addresses they anchor.

   HDAR (Home Distributed Anchor Router).  DAR which plays the role of
      Home Agent for a particular IPv6 address (i.e., DAR where that
      IPv6 address is anchored).


3.  Description of the solution

   Distributed Mobility Management approaches try to overcome the
   limitations of the traditional centralized mobility management, i.e.,
   Mobile IP, by bringing the mobility anchor closer to the MN.
   Following this idea, in our approach -- that we call Flat Access and
   Mobility Architecture (FAMA) -- the MIPv6 centralized home agent is
   moved to the edge of the network, being deployed in the default
   gateway of the mobile node.  That is, the first elements that provide
   IP connectivity to a set of MNs are also the mobility managers for
   those MNs.  In the following we will call these access routers
   Distributed Anchor Routers (DARs).

   The diagram in Figure 1 depicts the operations of the proposed
   solution.  When a mobile node attaches to a distributed anchor
   router, it gets an IPv6 address which is topologically anchored at
   the DAR (Pref1::addr1 - HoA1).  In the scheme we assume the address
   configuration takes place through a Router Solicitation/Router
   Advertisement handshake.  While attached to this DAR, the mobile can
   send and receive traffic using HoA1 without traversing any tunneling
   nor special packet handling.

   If the the mobile node moves to a different DAR, it gets a new IPv6
   address from the new access router (Pref2::addr2 - HoA2).  In case
   the MN wants to keep the reachability of the IPv6 address(es) it
   obtained from the previous DAR (note that this decision is dynamic
   and it is out of scope of this document, it can be done on an
   application basis for example), the host has to involve its MIPv6
   stack, by sending a Binding Update to the DAR where the IPv6 address
   is anchored, using the address obtained from the current DAR as
   care-of address (in our example the MN binds HoA2 as CoA to DAR1).

               Figure 1: Signalling after the first handover

   In this way, the IPv6 address that the node wants to maintain in use
   (Pref1::addr1) plays the role of home address (HoA1), and the DAR
   from where that address was configured plays the role of Home Agent
   (for that particular address).  In this scenario, old flows are
   anchored to the previous DAR (DAR1), which is in charge to
   encaspulate the packets and deliver them to the MN's CoA.  The IP
   tunnel is bi-directional, so the MN does the same when sending
   packets with the old address (HoA1).  Conversely, new IP flows are
   started using the address configured at the new DAR (HoA2).  These
   flows are handled by the new DAR as a plain IPv6 router.

   Note that the FAMA approach basically enables a mobile node to
   simultaneously handle several IPv6 addresses -- each of them anchored
   at a different DAR -- ensuring their continuous reachability by using
   Mobile IPv6 in a distributed fashion (i.e., each access router is a
   potential home agent for the address it delegates, if required).
   Figure 2 illustrates the above case in which the MN is connected to

   DAR2, but flow1 is anchored at DAR1, because it was started by the MN
   using the IPv6 address Pref1::addr1, configured when the MN was
   connected to DAR1.  In the same example, the MN starts flow2 using
   Pref2::addr2, assigned by DAR2.

   The same operations take place if the MN moves to another DAR.  The
   MN obtains a new address (Pref3::addr3 - HoA3), which is indicated as
   CoA in the BU messages sent by the MN to the previous DARs.  This
   distributed address anchoring is enabled on demand and on a per-
   address granularity, which means that depending on the user needs, it
   might be the case that all, some or none of the IPv6 addresses that a
   mobile node configures while moving within a FAMA domain, are kept
   reachable and used by the mobile.  The scheme in Figure 3 depicts the
   example where the MN updates all the previous DARs, mapping the
   corresponding HoA with the new CoA

               Figure 3: Signalling after a second handover

   In traditional Mobile IPv6, the communication between the MN and the
   HA is secured through IPsec [RFC4877].  Following a similar approach
   in FAMA is difficult due to the large number of security associations
   that would be required, since any gateway of the access network can
   play the role of home agent for any mobile node.  In order to
   overcome this problem and provide authentication between the DAR and
   the MNs, we propose the use of Cryptographically Generated Addresses
   [RFC3972] (CGAs), as introduced in [I-D.laganier-mext-cga].  CGAs are
   a powerful mechanism allowing authentication of the packets and
   requires no public-key infrastructure, hence it is well-suited for
   this application.

   Following the ideas presented above, every time an MN attaches to a
   DAR, it configures a CGA from a prefix anchored at the DAR (e.g., by
   using stateless address auto-configuration mechanisms).  This address



Bernardos, et al.       Expires January 14, 2014                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           A DMM solution for CMIP               July 2013


   can then be used by the MN to establish a communication with a remote
   Correspondent Node (CN) while attached to that particular DAR.  If
   the mobile then moves to a new DAR (nDAR), the following two cases
   are possible: i) there is no need for the address that was configured
   at the previous DAR (pDAR) to survive the movement: in this case
   there is no further action required; ii) the mobile wants to keep the
   reachability of the address configured at pDAR: in this case Mobile
   IPv6 is triggered, and the MN sends a Binding Update (BU) message to
   the pDAR, using the address configured at the previous DAR as home
   address, and the address configured at the new DAR as care-of
   address.  This BU includes the CGA parameters and signature
   [I-D.laganier-mext-cga], which are used by the receiving DAR to
   identify the MN as the legitimate owner of the address.  Although the
   use of CGAs does not impose a heavy burden in terms of performance,
   depending on the number of MNs handled at the DAR, the processing of
   the CGAs can be problematic.  To reduce the complexity of the
   proposed protocol, we suggest an alternative mechanism to
   authenticate any subsequent signaling packets exchanged between the
   MN and the DAR (in case the mobile performs a new attachment to a
   different DAR).  This alternative method relies on the use of a
   Permanent Home Keygen Token (PHKT), which will be used to generate
   the Authorization option that the MN has to include in all next
   Binding Update messages.  This token is forwarded to the MN in the
   Binding Acknowledgment message, sent on reply to the BU.  The
   procedure is depicted in Figure 4.  Once the signaling procedure is
   completed, a bi-directional tunnel is established between the mobile
   node and the DAR where the IPv6 address is anchored (the "home" DAR
   -- HDAR -- for that particular address), so the mobile can continue
   using the IPv6 address.

              Figure 4: Signaling between the MN and the DAR

   In case the MN performs any subsequent movements and it requires to
   maintain the reachability of an address for which it has already sent
   a BU, the following BU messages can be secured using the PHKT
   exchanged before, reducing the computational load at the receiving
   DAR.

   Note that on every attachment of a node to a DAR, the terminal also
   obtains a new IPv6 address which is topologically anchored at that
   DAR, and that this address can be used for new communications
   (avoiding in this way the tunneling required when using an address
   anchored at a different DAR).  A mobile can keep multiple IPv6
   addresses active and reachable at a given time, and that requires to
   send -- every time the MN moves -- a BU message to all the previous
   DARs that are anchoring the IP flows that the MN wish to maintain.


4.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.


5.  Security Considerations

   Although the approach documented in this document is attractive for
   the reduced signaling overhead caused by the mobility support, it can

Internet-Draft           A DMM solution for CMIP               July 2013


   be misused in some particular scenarios by malicious nodes that wish
   to export an incorrect CoA in the BU message, since it does provide
   proof of the MN's reachability at the visited network.  Indeed, the
   CGA approach assures that the BU message has been sent by the
   legitimate HoA's owner but it does not make sure that same MN to be
   reachable at the CoA indicated.  This requires further analysis.

   A possible approach to provide a more secure solution is the
   following: a Return Routability procedure similar to the one defined
   in MIPv6 Route Optimization can be used to mitigate the
   aforementioned security issue.  The Return Routability procedure
   starts after the handoff.  Instead of sending the BU message, the MN
   sends a Care-of Test Init message (CoTI).  This message is replied by
   the DAR with a Care-Of Test message containing a CoA Keygen Token.
   The MN can now send a BU using both Home and CoA Keygen tokens to
   proof its reachability at both the HoA and the CoA.  The message and
   the knowledge of both tokens is a proof that the MN is the legitimate
   node who has sent the BU and also is reachable at the CoA indicated.
   As all security improvements, the one proposed incurs in a
   performance penalty, in this case an increase in the handover delay.
   Specifically this enhanced security approach requires four messages
   to be exchanged between the MN and the DAR instead of the two
   messages of the original solution.  In terms of handover delay, it
   increases it by a factor of two, as the new solution requires to two
   Round Trip Times (RTTs) to conclude, instead of one.

Appendix A.  Comparison with Requirement document

   In this section we descrbe how our solution addresses the DMM
   requirements listed in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

A.1.  Distributed Processing

   "IP mobility, network access and routing solutions provided by DMM
   MUST enable distributed processing for mobility management of some
   flows so that traffic does not need to traverse centrally deployed
   mobility anchors and thereby avoid non-optimal routes."

   In our solution, a DAR is responsible to handle the mobility for
   those IP flows started when the MN is attached to it.  As long as the
   MN remains connected to the DAR's access links, the IP packets of
   such flows can benefit from the optimal path.  When the MN moves to
   another DAR, the path becomes non-optimal for ongoing flows, as they
   are anchored to the previous DAR, but newly started IP sessions are
   forwarded by the new DAR through the optimal path.

A.2.  Transparency to Upper Layers when needed

   "DMM solutions MUST provide transparent mobility support above the IP
   layer when needed.  Such transparency is needed, for example, when,
   upon change of point of attachment to the network, an application
   flow cannot cope with a change in the IP address.  However, it is not
   always necessary to maintain a stable home IP address or prefix for
   every application or at all times for a mobile node."

   Our DMM solution operates at the IP layer, hence upper layers are
   totally transparent to the mobility operations.  In particular,
   ongoing IP sessions are not disrupted after a change of access
   network.  The routability of the old address is ensured by the IP
   tunnel with the old DAR.  New IP sessions are started with the new
   address.  From the application's perspective, those processes which
   sockets are bound to a unique IP address do not suffer any impact.
   For the other applications, the sockets bound to the old address are
   preserved, whereas next sockets use the new address.

A.3.  IPv6 deployment

   "DMM solutions SHOULD target IPv6 as the primary deployment
   environment and SHOULD NOT be tailored specifically to support IPv4,
   in particular in situations where private IPv4 addresses and/or NATs
   are used."

   The DMM solution we propose targets IPv6 only.

A.4.  Existing mobility protocols

   "A DMM solution SHOULD first consider reusing and extending IETF-
   standardized protocols before specifying new protocols."

   This DMM solution is derived from the operations and messages
   specified in [RFC6275], [RFC3972], and [I-D.laganier-mext-cga].

A.5.  Co-existence with deployed networks and hosts

   "The DMM solution MUST be able to co-exist with existing network
   deployments and end hosts.  For example, depending on the environment
   in which DMM is deployed, DMM solutions may need to be compatible
   with other deployed mobility protocols or may need to co-exist with a
   network or mobile hosts/routers that do not support DMM protocols.
   The mobile node may also move between different access networks,
   where some of them may support neither DMM nor another mobility
   protocol.  Furthermore, a DMM solution SHOULD work across different
   networks, possibly operated as separate administrative domains, when
   allowed by the trust relationship between them."

Internet-Draft           A DMM solution for CMIP               July 2013


   The proposed solution can provide a fallback mechanism employing
   legacy Mobile IPv6, for instance forcing the MN to use only one DAR.
   Moreover, this solution applies when the MN is connected to an
   administrative domain not supporting trust relationships.  Indeed,
   all the IP sessions can remain anchored to the DARs of the "home"
   domain.  Our solution can be deployed across different domains with
   trust agreements.

A.6.  Security considerations

   "DMM protocol solutions MUST consider security risks introduced by
   DMM into the network.  Such considerations may include authentication
   and authorization mechanisms that allow a mobile host/router to use
   the mobility support provided by the DMM solution; measures against
   redirecting traffic to the wrong host when providing DMM support;
   signaling message protection for authentication, integrity and
   confidentiality."

   The proposed solution uses a CGA-based security system to enable
   authentication and authorization of mobile hosts.

A.7.  Multicast

   "DMM SHOULD enable multicast solutions in flexible distribution
   scenario.  This flexibility pertains to the preservation of IP
   multicast nature from the perspective of a mobility entity and
   transmission of multicast packets to/from various multicast- enabled
   entities.  Therefore, this flexibility enables different IP multicast
   flows with respect to a mobile host to be managed (e.g., subscribed,
   received and/or transmitted) using multiple multicast-enabled
   endpoints."

   This solution does not include multicast traffic in its scope.
   Nevertheless, it allows combining multicast support solutions, such
   as local subscription at each DAR, which would result in a flexible
   distribution scenario.
