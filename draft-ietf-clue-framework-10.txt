1. Introduction 

   Current telepresence systems, though based on open standards such 
   as RTP [RFC3550] and SIP [RFC3261], cannot easily interoperate with 
   each other.  A major factor limiting the interoperability of 
   telepresence systems is the lack of a standardized way to describe 
   and negotiate the use of the multiple streams of audio and video 
   comprising the media flows.  This draft provides a framework for a 
   protocol to enable interoperability by handling multiple streams in 
   a standardized way.  It is intended to support the use cases 
   described in draft-ietf-clue-telepresence-use-cases and to meet the 
   requirements in draft-ietf-clue-telepresence-requirements. 

   Conceptually distinguished are Media Providers and Media Consumers.  
   A Media Provider provides Media in the form of RTP packets, a Media 
   Consumer consumes those RTP packets.  Media Providers and Media 
   Consumers can reside in Endpoints or in middleboxes such as 
   Multipoint Control Units (MCUs).  A Media Provider in an Endpoint 
   is usually associated with the generation of media for Media 
   Captures; these Media Captures are typically sourced from cameras, 
   microphones, and the like.  Similarly, the Media Consumer in an 
   Endpoint is usually associated with Renderers, such as screens and 
   loudspeakers.  In middleboxes, Media Providers and Consumers can 
   have the form of outputs and inputs, respectively, of RTP mixers, 
   RTP translators, and similar devices.  Typically, telepresence 
   devices such as Endpoints and middleboxes would perform as both 
   Media Providers and Media Consumers, the former being concerned 
   with those devices' transmitted media and the latter with those 
   devices' received media.  In a few circumstances, a CLUE Endpoint 
   middlebox may include only Consumer or Provider functionality, such 
   as recorder-type Consumers or webcam-type Providers.   

   Motivations for this document (and, in fact, for the existence of 
   the CLUE protocol) include: 

   (1) Endpoints according to this document can, and usually do, have 
   multiple Media Captures and Media Renderers, that is, for example, 
   multiple cameras and screens.  While previous system designs were 
   able to set up calls that would light up all screens and cameras

   (or equivalent), what was missing was a mechanism that can 
   associate the Media Captures with each other in space and time.   

   (2) The mere fact that there are multiple capture and rendering 
   devices, each of which may be configurable in aspects such as zoom, 
   leads to the difficulty that a variable number of such devices can 
   be used to capture different aspects of a region.  The Capture 
   Scene concept allows for the description of multiple setups for 
   those multiple capture devices that could represent sensible 
   operation points of the physical capture devices in a room, chosen 
   by the operator.  A Consumer can pick and choose from those 
   configurations based on its rendering abilities and inform the 
   Provider about its choices.  Details are provided in section 6.   

   (3) In some cases, physical limitations or other reasons disallow 
   the concurrent use of a device in more than one setup.  For 
   example, the center camera in a typical three-camera conference 
   room can set its zoom objective either to capture only the middle 
   few seats, or all seats of a room, but not both concurrently.  The 
   Simultaneous Transmission Set concept allows a Provider to signal 
   such limitations.  Simultaneous Transmission Sets are part of the 
   Capture Scene description, and discussed in section 6.3.  

   (4) Often, the devices in a room do not have the computational 
   complexity or connectivity to deal with multiple encoding options 
   simultaneously, even if each of these options may be sensible in 
   certain environments, and even if the simultaneous transmission may 
   also be sensible (i.e. in case of multicast media distribution to 
   multiple endpoints).   Such constraints can be expressed by the 
   Provider using the Encoding Group concept, described in section 7.  

   (5) Due to the potentially large number of RTP flows required for a 
   Multimedia Conference involving potentially many Endpoints, each of 
   which can have many Media Captures and Media Renderers, a sensible 
   system design is to multiplex multiple RTP media flows onto the 
   same transport address, so to avoid using the port number as a 
   multiplexing point and the associated shortcomings such as 
   NAT/firewall traversal.  While the actual mapping of those RTP 
   flows to the header fields of the RTP packets is not subject of 
   this specification, the large number of possible permutations of 
   sensible options a Media Provider may make available to a Media 
   Consumer makes a mechanism desirable that allows to narrow down the 
   number of possible options that a SIP offer-answer exchange has to 
   consider.  Such information is made available using protocol 
   mechanisms specified in this document and companion documents,

   although it should be stressed that its use in an implementation is 
   optional.  Also, there are aspects of the control of both Endpoints 
   and middleboxes/MCUs that dynamically change during the progress of 
   a call, such as audio-level based screen switching, layout changes, 
   and so on, which need to be conveyed.  Note that these control 
   aspects are complementary to those specified in traditional SIP 
   based conference management such as BFCP.  An exemplary call flow 
   can be found in section 4.   

   Finally, all this information needs to be conveyed, and the notion 
   of support for it needs to be established.  This is done by the 
   negotiation of a "CLUE channel", a data channel negotiated early 
   during the initiation of a call.  An Endpoint or MCU that rejects 
   the establishment of this data channel, by definition, is not 
   supporting CLUE based mechanisms, whereas an Endpoint or MCU that 
   accepts it is required to use it to the extent specified in this 
   document and its companion documents. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 
   [RFC2119]. 

3. Definitions 

   The terms defined below are used throughout this document and 
   companion documents and they are normative.  In order to easily 
   identify the use of a defined term, those terms are capitalized. 

   Advertisement: a CLUE message a Media Provider sends to a Media 
   Consumer describing specific aspects of the content of the media, 
   the formatting of the media streams it can send, and any 
   restrictions it has in terms of being able to provide certain 
   Streams simultaneously. 

   Audio Capture: Media Capture for audio.  Denoted as ACn in the 
   example cases in this document. 

   Camera-Left and Right: For Media Captures, camera-left and camera-
   right are from the point of view of a person observing the rendered 
   media.  They are the opposite of Stage-Left and Stage-Right. 

   Capture: Same as Media Capture.

   Capture Device: A device that converts audio and video input into 
   an electrical signal, in most cases to be fed into a media encoder. 

   Capture Encoding: A specific encoding of a Media Capture, to be 
   sent by a Media Provider to a Media Consumer via RTP. 

   Capture Scene: a structure representing a spatial region containing 
   one or more Capture Devices, each capturing media representing a 
   portion of the region. The spatial region represented by a Capture 
   Scene may or may not correspond to a real region in physical space, 
   such as a room.  A Capture Scene includes attributes and one or 
   more Capture Scene Entries, with each entry including one or more 
   Media Captures. 

   Capture Scene Entry: a list of Media Captures of the same media 
   type that together form one way to represent the entire Capture 
   Scene. 

   Conference: used as defined in [RFC4353], A Framework for 
   Conferencing within the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). 

   Configure Message: A CLUE message a Media Consumer sends to a Media 
   Provider specifying which content and media streams it wants to 
   receive, based on the information in a corresponding Advertisement 
   message. 

   Consumer: short for Media Consumer. 

   Encoding or Individual Encoding: a set of parameters representing a 
   way to encode a Media Capture to become a Capture Encoding. 

   Encoding Group: A set of encoding parameters representing a total 
   media encoding capability to be sub-divided across potentially 
   multiple Individual Encodings. 

   Endpoint: The logical point of final termination through receiving, 
   decoding and rendering, and/or initiation through capturing, 
   encoding, and sending of media streams.  An endpoint consists of 
   one or more physical devices which source and sink media streams, 
   and exactly one [RFC4353] Participant (which, in turn, includes 
   exactly one SIP User Agent).  Endpoints can be anything from 
   multiscreen/multicamera rooms to handheld devices. 

   Front: the portion of the room closest to the cameras.  In going 
   towards back you move away from the cameras.

   MCU: Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) - a device that connects two or 
   more endpoints together into one single multimedia conference 
   [RFC5117].  An MCU includes an [RFC4353] like Mixer, without the 
   [RFC4353] requirement to send media to each participant.   

    

   Media: Any data that, after suitable encoding, can be conveyed over 
   RTP, including audio, video or timed text. 

   Media Capture: a source of Media, such as from one or more Capture 
   Devices or constructed from other Media streams.  

   Media Consumer: an Endpoint or middle box that receives Media 
   streams 

   Media Provider: an Endpoint or middle box that sends Media streams 

   Model: a set of assumptions a telepresence system of a given vendor 
   adheres to and expects the remote telepresence system(s) also to 
   adhere to. 

   Plane of Interest: The spatial plane containing the most relevant 
   subject matter. 

   Provider: Same as Media Provider. 

   Render: the process of generating a representation from a media, 
   such as displayed motion video or sound emitted from loudspeakers. 

   Simultaneous Transmission Set: a set of Media Captures that can be 
   transmitted simultaneously from a Media Provider. 

   Spatial Relation: The arrangement in space of two objects, in 
   contrast to relation in time or other relationships.  See also 
   Camera-Left and Right. 

   Stage-Left and Right: For Media Captures, Stage-left and Stage-
   right are the opposite of Camera-left and Camera-right.  For the 
   case of a person facing (and captured by) a camera, Stage-left and 
   Stage-right are from the point of view of that person. 

   Stream: a Capture Encoding sent from a Media Provider to a Media 
   Consumer via RTP [RFC3550].

   Stream Characteristics: the media stream attributes commonly used 
   in non-CLUE SIP/SDP environments (such as: media codec, bit rate, 
   resolution, profile/level etc.) as well as CLUE specific 
   attributes, such as the Capture ID or a spatial location. 

   Video Capture: Media Capture for video.  Denoted as VCn in the 
   example cases in this document. 

   Video Composite: A single image that is formed, normally by an RTP 
   mixer inside an MCU, by combining visual elements from separate 
   sources. 

4. Overview of the Framework/Model 

   The CLUE framework specifies how multiple media streams are to be 
   handled in a telepresence conference. 

   A Media Provider (transmitting Endpoint or MCU) describes specific 
   aspects of the content of the media and the formatting of the media 
   streams it can send in an Advertisement; and the Media Consumer 
   responds to the Media Provider by specifying which content and 
   media streams it wants to receive in a Configure message.  The 
   Provider then transmits the asked-for content in the specified 
   streams. 

   This Advertisement and Configure occurs as a minimum during call 
   initiation but may also happen at any time throughout the call, 
   whenever there is a change in what the Consumer wants to receive or 
   (perhaps less common) the Provider can send. 

   An Endpoint or MCU typically act as both Provider and Consumer at 
   the same time, sending Advertisements and sending Configurations in 
   response to receiving Advertisements.  (It is possible to be just 
   one or the other.) 

   The data model is based around two main concepts: a Capture and an 
   Encoding.  A Media Capture (MC), such as audio or video, describes 
   the content a Provider can send.  Media Captures are described in 
   terms of CLUE-defined attributes, such as spatial relationships and 
   purpose of the capture.  Providers tell Consumers which Media 
   Captures they can provide, described in terms of the Media Capture 
   attributes. 

   A Provider organizes its Media Captures into one or more Capture 
   Scenes, each representing a spatial region, such as a room.  A

Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

   Consumer chooses which Media Captures it wants to receive from each 
   Capture Scene. 

   In addition, the Provider can send the Consumer a description of 
   the Individual Encodings it can send in terms of the media 
   attributes of the Encodings, in particular, audio and video 
   parameters such as bandwidth, frame rate, macroblocks per second.  
   Note that this is optional, and intended to minimize the number of 
   options a later SDP offer-answer would require to include in the 
   SDP in case of complex setups, as should become clearer shortly 
   when discussing an outline of the call flow. 

   The Provider can also specify constraints on its ability to provide 
   Media, and a sensible design choice for a Consumer is to take these 
   into account when choosing the content and Capture Encodings it 
   requests in the later offer-answer exchange.  Some constraints are 
   due to the physical limitations of devices - for example, a camera 
   may not be able to provide zoom and non-zoom views simultaneously.  
   Other constraints are system based constraints, such as maximum 
   bandwidth and maximum macroblocks/second. 

   A very brief outline of the call flow used by a simple system (two 
   Endpoints) in compliance with this document can be described as 
   follows, and as shown in the following figure.

   An initial offer/answer exchange establishes a basic media session, 
   for example audio-only, and a CLUE channel between two Endpoints.  
   With the establishment of that channel, the endpoints have 
   consented to use the CLUE protocol mechanisms and have to adhere to 
   them. 

   Over this CLUE channel, the Provider in each Endpoint conveys its 
   characteristics and capabilities by sending an Advertisement as 
   specified herein (which will typically not be sufficient to set up 
   all media).  The Consumer in the Endpoint receives the information 
   provided by the Provider, and can use it for two purposes.  First, 
   it constructs and sends a CLUE Configure message to tell the 
   Provider what the Consumer wishes to receive.  Second, it can, but 
   is not necessarily required to, use the information provided to 
   tailor the SDP it is going to send during the following SIP 
   offer/answer exchange, and its reaction to SDP it receives in that 
   step.  It is often a sensible implementation choice to do so, as 
   the representation of the media information conveyed over the CLUE 
   channel can dramatically cut down on the size of SDP messages used 
   in the O/A exchange that follows.  Spatial relationships associated 
   with the Media can be included in the Advertisement, and it is

   often sensible for the Media Consumer to take those spatial 
   relationships into account when tailoring the SDP. 

   This CLUE exchange is followed by an SDP offer answer exchange that 
   not only establishes those aspects of the media that have not been 
   "negotiated" over CLUE, but has also the side effect of setting up 
   the media transmission itself, involving potentially security 
   exchanges, ICE, and whatnot.  This step is plain vanilla SIP, with 
   the exception that the SDP used herein, in most cases can (but not 
   necessarily must) be considerably smaller than the SDP a system 
   would typically need to exchange if there were no pre-established 
   knowledge about the Provider and Consumer characteristics.  (The 
   need for cutting down SDP size may not be obvious for a point-to-
   point call involving simple endpoints; however, when considering a 
   large multipoint conference involving many multi-screen/multi-
   camera endpoints, each of which can operate using multiple codecs 
   for each camera and microphone, it becomes perhaps somewhat more 
   intuitive.) 

   During the lifetime of a call, further exchanges can occur over the 
   CLUE channel.  In some cases, those further exchanges can lead to a 
   modified system behavior of Provider or Consumer (or both) without 
   any other protocol activity such as further offer/answer exchanges.  
   For example, voice-activated screen switching, signaled over the 
   CLUE channel, ought not to lead to heavy-handed mechanisms like SIP 
   re-invites.  However, in other cases, after the CLUE negotiation an 
   additional offer/answer exchange may become necessary.  For 
   example, if both sides decide to upgrade the call from a single 
   screen to a multi-screen call and more bandwidth is required for 
   the additional video channels, that could require a new O/A 
   exchange. 

   Numerous optimizations may be possible, and are the implementer's 
   choice.  For example, it may be sensible to establish one or more 
   initial media channels during the initial offer/answer exchange, 
   which would allow, for example, for a fast startup of audio.  
   Depending on the system design, it may be possible to re-use this 
   established channel for more advanced media negotiated only by CLUE 
   mechanisms, thereby avoiding further offer/answer exchanges.   

    

   Edt. note: The editors are not sure whether the mentioned 
   overloading of established RTP channels using only CLUE messages is 
   possible, or desired by the WG.  If it were, certainly there is

   need for specification work.  One possible issue: a Provider which 
   thinks that it can switch, say, a audio codec algorithm by CLUE 
   only, talks to a  Consumer which thinks that it has to faithfully 
   answer the Providers Advertisement through a Configure, but does 
   not dare setting up its internal resource until such time it has 
   received its authoritative O/A exchange.  Working group input is 
   solicited.   

    

   One aspect of the protocol outlined herein and specified in 
   normative detail in companion documents is that it makes available 
   information regarding the Provider's capabilities to deliver Media, 
   and attributes related to that Media such as their spatial 
   relationship, to the Consumer.  The operation of the Renderer 
   inside the Consumer is unspecified in that it can choose to ignore 
   some information provided by the Provider, and/or not render media 
   streams available from the Provider (although it has to follow the 
   CLUE protocol and, therefore, has to gracefully receive and respond 
   (through a Configure) to the Provider's information).  All CLUE 
   protocol mechanisms are optional in the Consumer in the sense that, 
   while the Consumer must be able to receive (and, potentially, 
   gracefully acknowledge) CLUE messages, it is free to ignore the 
   information provided therein.  Obviously, this is not a 
   particularly sensible design choice. 

   Legacy devices are defined here in as those Endpoints and MCUs that 
   do not support the setup and use of the CLUE channel.  The notion 
   of a device being a legacy device is established during the initial 
   offer/answer exchange, in which the legacy device will not 
   understand the offer for the CLUE channel and, therefore, reject 
   it.  This is the indication for the CLUE-implementing Endpoint or 
   MCU that the other side of the communication is not compliant with 
   CLUE, and to fall back to whatever mechanism was used before the 
   introduction of CLUE. 

   As for the media, Provider and Consumer have an end-to-end 
   communication relationship with respect to (RTP transported) media; 
   and the mechanisms described herein and in companion documents do 
   not change the aspects of setting up those RTP flows and sessions. 
   In other words, the RTP media sessions conform to the negotiated 
   SDP whether or not CLUE is used. However, it should be noted that 
   forms of RTP multiplexing of multiple RTP flows onto the same 
   transport address are developed concurrently with the CLUE suite of 
   specifications, and it is widely expected that most, if not all, 

 
Duckworth et. al.     Expires November 16, 2013         [Page 12] 







Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

   Endpoints or MCUs supporting CLUE will also support those 
   mechanisms.  Some design choices made in this document reflect this 
   coincidence in spec development timing.  

    

5. Spatial Relationships 

   In order for a Consumer to perform a proper rendering, it is often 
   necessary or at least helpful for the Consumer to have received 
   spatial information about the streams it is receiving.  CLUE 
   defines a coordinate system that allows Media Providers to describe 
   the spatial relationships of their Media Captures to enable proper 
   scaling and spatially sensible rendering of their streams.  The 
   coordinate system is based on a few principles: 

   o  Simple systems which do not have multiple Media Captures to 
      associate spatially need not use the coordinate model. 

   o  Coordinates can either be in real, physical units (millimeters), 
      have an unknown scale or have no physical scale.  Systems which 
      know their physical dimensions (for example professionally 
      installed Telepresence room systems) should always provide those 
      real-world measurements.  Systems which don't know specific 
      physical dimensions but still know relative distances should use 
      'unknown scale'.  'No scale' is intended to be used where Media 
      Captures from different devices (with potentially different 
      scales) will be forwarded alongside one another (e.g. in the 
      case of a middle box). 

      *  "millimeters" means the scale is in millimeters 

      *  "Unknown" means the scale is not necessarily millimeters, but 
         the scale is the same for every Capture in the Capture Scene. 

      *  "No Scale" means the scale could be different for each 
         capture- an MCU provider that advertises two adjacent 
         captures and picks sources (which can change quickly) from 
         different endpoints might use this value; the scale could be 
         different and changing for each capture.  But the areas of 
         capture still represent a spatial relation between captures.

   o  The coordinate system is Cartesian X, Y, Z with the origin at a 
      spatial location of the provider's choosing.  The Provider must 
      use the same coordinate system with same scale and origin for 
      all coordinates within the same Capture Scene. 

   The direction of increasing coordinate values is: 
   X increases from Camera-Left to Camera-Right 
   Y increases from Front to back 
   Z increases from low to high 

6. Media Captures and Capture Scenes 

   This section describes how  Providers can describe the content of 
   media to Consumers. 

6.1. Media Captures 

   Media Captures are the fundamental representations of streams that 
   a device can transmit.  What a Media Capture actually represents is 
   flexible: 

   o  It can represent the immediate output of a physical source (e.g. 
      camera, microphone) or 'synthetic' source (e.g. laptop computer, 
      DVD player). 

   o  It can represent the output of an audio mixer or video composer 

   o  It can represent a concept such as 'the loudest speaker' 

   o  It can represent a conceptual position such as 'the leftmost 
      stream' 

   To identify and distinguish between multiple instances, video and 
   audio captures are labeled.  For instance: VC1, VC2 and AC1, AC2, 
   where  VC1 and VC2 refer to two different video captures and AC1 
   and AC2 refer to two different audio captures. 

   Some key points about Media Captures: 

     . A Media Capture is of a single media type (e.g. audio or 
        video)  
     . A Media Capture is associated with exactly one Capture Scene 
     . A Media Capture is associated with one or more Capture Scene 
        Entries 
     . A Media Capture has exactly one set of spatial information 

 
Duckworth et. al.     Expires November 16, 2013         [Page 14] 







Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

     . A Media Capture may be the source of one or more Capture 
        Encodings 

   Each Media Capture can be associated with attributes to describe 
   what it represents. 

6.1.1. Media Capture Attributes 

   Media Capture Attributes describe information about the Captures.  
   A Provider can use the Media Capture Attributes to describe the 
   Captures for the benefit of the Consumer in the Advertisement 
   message.  Media Capture Attributes include:  

     . spatial information, such as point of capture, point on line 
        of capture, and area of capture, all of which, in combination 
        define the capture field of, for example, a camera; 
     . Capture multiplexing information (composed/switched video, 
        mono/stereo audio, maximum number of simultaneous encodings 
        per Capture and so on); and 
     . Other descriptive information to help the Consumer choose 
        between captures (presentation, view, priority, language, 
        role). 
     . Control information for use inside the CLUE protocol suite. 

   Point of Capture: 

   A field with a single Cartesian (X, Y, Z) point value which 
   describes the spatial location of the capturing device (such as 
   camera). 

   Point on Line of Capture: 

   A field with a single Cartesian (X, Y, Z) point value which 
   describes a position in space of a second point on the axis of the 
   capturing device; the first point being the Point of Capture (see 
   above). 

   Together, the Point of Capture and Point on Line of Capture define 
   an axis of the capturing device, for example the optical axis of a 
   camera.  The Media Consumer can use this information to adjust how 
   it renders the received media if it so chooses. 

   Area of Capture: 



 
Duckworth et. al.     Expires November 16, 2013         [Page 15] 







Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

   A field with a set of four (X, Y, Z) points as a value which 
   describe the spatial location of what is being "captured".  By 
   comparing the Area of Capture for different Media Captures within 
   the same Capture Scene a consumer can determine the spatial 
   relationships between them and render them correctly. 

   The four points should be co-planar, forming a quadrilateral, which 
   defines the Plane of Interest for the particular media capture. 

   If the Area of Capture is not specified, it means the Media Capture 
   is not spatially related to any other Media Capture. 

   For a switched capture that switches between different sections 
   within a larger area, the area of capture should use coordinates 
   for the larger potential area. 

   Mobility of Capture: 

   This attribute indicates whether or not the point of capture, line 
   on point of capture, and area of capture values will stay the same, 
   or are expected to change frequently.  Possible values are static, 
   dynamic, and highly dynamic. 

   For example, a camera may be placed at different positions in order 
   to provide the best angle to capture a work task, or may include a 
   camera worn by a participant. This would have an effect of changing 
   the capture point, capture axis and area of capture. In order that 
   the Consumer can choose to render the capture appropriately, the 
   Provider can include this attribute to indicate if the camera 
   location is dynamic or not. 

   The capture point of a static capture does not move for the life of 
   the conference. The capture point of dynamic captures is 
   categorised by a change in position followed by a reasonable period 
   of stability. High dynamic captures are categorised by a capture 
   point that is constantly moving.  If the "area of capture", 
   "capture point" and "line of capture" attributes are included with 
   dynamic or highly dynamic captures they indicate spatial 
   information at the time of the Advertisement. No information 
   regarding future spatial information should be assumed. 

   Composed: 

   A boolean field which indicates whether or not the Media Capture is 
   a mix (audio) or composition (video) of streams. 

 
Duckworth et. al.     Expires November 16, 2013         [Page 16] 







Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

   This attribute is useful for a media consumer to avoid nesting a 
   composed video capture into another composed capture or rendering. 
   This attribute is not intended to describe the layout a media 
   provider uses when composing video streams. 

   Switched: 

   A boolean field which indicates whether or not the Media Capture 
   represents the (dynamic) most appropriate subset of a 'whole'.  
   What is 'most appropriate' is up to the provider and could be the 
   active speaker, a lecturer or a VIP. 

   Audio Channel Format: 

   A field with enumerated values which describes the method of 
   encoding used for audio. A value of 'mono' means the Audio Capture 
   has one channel.  'stereo' means the Audio Capture has two audio 
   channels, left and right. 

   This attribute applies only to Audio Captures.  A single stereo 
   capture is different from two mono captures that have a left-right 
   spatial relationship.  A stereo capture maps to a single Capture 
   Encoding, while each mono audio capture maps to a separate Capture 
   Encoding. 

   Max Capture Encodings: 

   An optional attribute indicating the maximum number of Capture 
   Encodings that can be simultaneously active for the Media Capture.  
   The number of simultaneous Capture Encodings is also limited by the 
   restrictions of the Encoding Group for the Media Capture. 

   Presentation: 

   This attribute indicates that the capture originates from a 
   presentation device, that is one that provides supplementary 
   information to a conference through slides, video, still images, 
   data etc.  Where more information is known about the capture it may 
   be expanded hierarchically to indicate the different types of 
   presentation media, e.g. presentation.slides, presentation.image 
   etc. 

   Note: It is expected that a number of keywords will be defined that 
   provide more detail on the type of presentation.

Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

   View: 

   A field with enumerated values, indicating what type of view the 
   capture relates to.  The Consumer can use this information to help 
   choose which Media Captures it wishes to receive.  The value can be 
   one of: 

   Room - Captures the entire scene 

   Table - Captures the conference table with seated participants 

   Individual - Captures an individual participant 

   Lectern - Captures the region of the lectern including the 
   presenter in a classroom style conference 

   Audience - Captures a region showing the audience in a classroom 
   style conference 

   Language: 

   This attribute indicates one or more languages used in the content 
   of the media capture.  Captures may be offered in different 
   languages in case of multilingualand/or accessible conferences, so 
   a Consumer can use this attribute to differentiate between them.   

   This indicates which language is associated with the capture.  For 
   example: it may provide a language associated with an audio capture 
   or a language associated with a video capture when sign 
   interpretation or text is used. 

   Role: 

   Edt. Note -- this is a placeholder for a role attribute, as 
   discussed in draft-groves-clue-capture-attr.  We expect to continue 
   discussing the role attribute in the context of that draft, and 
   follow-on drafts, before adding it to this framework document. 

   Priority: 

   This attribute indicates a relative priority between different 
   Media Captures.  The Provider sets this priority, and the Consumer 
   may use the priority to help decide which captures it wishes to 
   receive. 


 
Duckworth et. al.     Expires November 16, 2013         [Page 18] 







Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

   The "priority" attribute is an integer which indicates a relative 
   priority between captures. For example it is possible to assign a 
   priority between two presentation captures that would allow a 
   remote endpoint to determine which presentation is more important. 
   Priority is assigned at the individual capture level. It represents 
   the Provider's view of the relative priority between captures with 
   a priority. The same priority number may be used across multiple 
   captures. It indicates they are equally as important. If no 
   priority is assigned no assumptions regarding relative important of 
   the capture can be assumed. 

   Embedded Text: 

   This attribute indicates that a capture provides embedded textual 
   information. For example the video capture may contain speech to 
   text information composed with the video image. This attribute is 
   only applicable to video captures and presentation streams with 
   visual information. 

   Related To: 

   This attribute indicates the capture contains additional 
   complementary information related to another capture.  The value 
   indicates the other capture to which this capture is providing 
   additional information. 

   For example, a conferences can utilise translators or facilitators 
   that provide an additional audio stream (i.e. a translation or 
   description or commentary of the conference).  Where multiple 
   captures are available, it may be advantageous for a Consumer to 
   select a complementary capture instead of or in addition to a 
   capture it relates to. 

6.2. Capture Scene 

   In order for a Provider's individual Captures to be used 
   effectively by a Consumer, the provider organizes the Captures into 
   one or more Capture Scenes, with the structure and contents of 
   these Capture Scenes being sent from the Provider to the Consumer 
   in the Advertisement. 

   A Capture Scene is a structure representing a spatial region 
   containing one or more Capture Devices, each capturing media 
   representing a portion of the region.  A Capture Scene includes one 
   or more Capture Scene entries, with each entry including one or 

 
Duckworth et. al.     Expires November 16, 2013         [Page 19] 







Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

   more Media Captures.  A Capture Scene represents, for example, the 
   video image of a group of people seated next to each other, along 
   with the sound of their voices, which could be represented by some 
   number of VCs and ACs in the Capture Scene Entries.  A middle box 
   may also express Capture Scenes that it constructs from media 
   Streams it receives. 

   A Provider may advertise multiple Capture Scenes or just a single 
   Capture Scene.  What constitutes an entire Capture Scene is up to 
   the Provider.  A Provider might typically use one Capture Scene for 
   participant media (live video from the room cameras) and another 
   Capture Scene for a computer generated presentation.  In more 
   complex systems, the use of additional Capture Scenes is also 
   sensible.  For example, a classroom may advertise two Capture 
   Scenes involving live video, one including only the camera 
   capturing the instructor (and associated audio), the other 
   including camera(s) capturing students (and associated audio).   

   A Capture Scene may (and typically will) include more than one type 
   of media.  For example, a Capture Scene can include several Capture 
   Scene Entries for Video Captures, and several Capture Scene Entries 
   for Audio Captures.  A particular Capture may be included in more 
   than one Capture Scene Entry. 

   A provider can express spatial relationships between Captures that 
   are included in the same Capture Scene.  However, there is not 
   necessarily the same spatial relationship between Media Captures 
   that are in different Capture Scenes.  In other words, Capture 
   Scenes can use their own spatial measurement system as outlined 
   above in section 5.  

   A Provider arranges Captures in a Capture Scene to help the 
   Consumer choose which captures it wants.  The Capture Scene Entries 
   in a Capture Scene are different alternatives the provider is 
   suggesting for representing the Capture Scene.  The order of 
   Capture Scene Entries within a Capture Scene has no significance.  
   The Media Consumer can choose to receive all Media Captures from 
   one Capture Scene Entry for each media type (e.g. audio and video), 
   or it can pick and choose Media Captures regardless of how the 
   Provider arranges them in Capture Scene Entries.  Different Capture 
   Scene Entries of the same media type are not necessarily mutually 
   exclusive alternatives.  Also note that the presence of multiple 
   Capture Scene Entries (with potentially multiple encoding options 
   in each entry) in a given Capture Scene does not necessarily imply 
   that a Provider is able to serve all the associated media 

 
Duckworth et. al.     Expires November 16, 2013         [Page 20] 







Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

   simultaneously (although the construction of such an over-rich 
   Capture Scene is probably not sensible in many cases).  What a 
   Provider can send simultaneously is determined through the 
   Simultaneous Transmission Set mechanism, described in section 6.3.  

   Captures within the same Capture Scene entry must be of the same 
   media type - it is not possible to mix audio and video captures in 
   the same Capture Scene Entry, for instance.  The Provider must be 
   capable of encoding and sending all Captures in a single Capture 
   Scene Entry simultaneously.  The order of Captures within a Capture 
   Scene Entry has no significance.  A Consumer may decide to receive 
   all the Captures in a single Capture Scene Entry, but a Consumer 
   could also decide to receive just a subset of those captures.  A 
   Consumer can also decide to receive Captures from different Capture 
   Scene Entries, all subject to the constraints set by Simultaneous 
   Transmission Sets, as discussed in section 6.3.  

   When a Provider advertises a Capture Scene with multiple entries, 
   it is essentially signaling that there are multiple representations 
   of the same Capture Scene available.  In some cases, these multiple 
   representations would typically be used simultaneously (for 
   instance a "video entry" and an "audio entry").  In some cases the 
   entries would conceptually be alternatives (for instance an entry 
   consisting of three Video Captures covering the whole room versus 
   an entry consisting of just a single Video Capture covering only 
   the center if a room).  In this latter example, one sensible choice 
   for a Consumer would be to indicate (through its Configure and 
   possibly through an additional offer/answer exchange) the Captures 
   of that Capture Scene Entry that most closely matched the 
   Consumer's number of display devices or screen layout. 

   The following is an example of 4 potential Capture Scene Entries 
   for an endpoint-style Provider: 

   1.  (VC0, VC1, VC2) - left, center and right camera Video Captures 

   2.  (VC3) - Video Capture associated with loudest room segment 

   3.  (VC4) - Video Capture zoomed out view of all people in the room 

   4.  (AC0) - main audio 

   The first entry in this Capture Scene example is a list of Video 
   Captures which have a spatial relationship to each other.  
   Determination of the order of these captures (VC0, VC1 and VC2) for

   rendering purposes is accomplished through use of their Area of 
   Capture attributes.  The second entry (VC3) and the third entry 
   (VC4) are alternative representations of the same room's video, 
   which might be better suited to some Consumers' rendering 
   capabilities.  The inclusion of the Audio Capture in the same 
   Capture Scene indicates that AC0 is associated with all of those 
   Video Captures, meaning it comes from the same spatial region.  
   Therefore, if audio were to be rendered at all, this audio would be 
   the correct choice irrespective of which Video Captures were 
   chosen.  

    

    

6.2.1. Capture Scene attributes 

   Capture Scene Attributes can be applied to Capture Scenes as well 
   as to individual media captures.  Attributes specified at this 
   level apply to all constituent Captures.  Capture Scene attributes 
   include 

     . Human-readable description of the Capture Scene, which could 
        be in multiple languages; 
     . Scale information (millimeters, unknown, no scale), as 
        described in Section 5. 

    

6.2.2. Capture Scene Entry attributes 

   A Capture Scene can include one or more Capture Scene Entries in 
   addition to the Capture Scene wide attributes described above.  
   Capture Scene Entry attributes apply to the Capture Scene Entry as 
   a whole, i.e. to all Captures that are part of the Capture Scene 
   Entry. 

   Capture Scene Entry attributes include: 

     . Scene-switch-policy: {site-switch, segment-switch} 

   A media provider uses this scene-switch-policy attribute to 
   indicate its support for different switching policies.  In the 
   provider's Advertisement, this attribute can have multiple values, 
   which means the provider supports each of the indicated policies.  

 
Duckworth et. al.     Expires November 16, 2013         [Page 22] 







Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

   The consumer, when it requests media captures from this Capture 
   Scene Entry, should also include this attribute but with only the 
   single value (from among the values indicated by the provider) 
   indicating the Consumer's choice for which policy it wants the 
   provider to use.  The Consumer must choose the same value for all 
   the Media Captures in the Capture Scene Entry.  If the provider 
   does not support any of these policies, it should omit this 
   attribute. 

   The "site-switch" policy means all captures are switched at the 
   same time to keep captures from the same endpoint site together.  
   Let's say the speaker is at site A and everyone else is at a 
   "remote" site. 

   When the room at site A shown, all the camera images from site A 
   are forwarded to the remote sites.  Therefore at each receiving 
   remote site, all the screens display camera images from site A. 
   This can be used to preserve full size image display, and also 
   provide full visual context of the displayed far end, site A. In 
   site switching, there is a fixed relation between the cameras in 
   each room and the displays in remote rooms.  The room or 
   participants being shown is switched from time to time based on who 
   is speaking or by manual control. 

   The "segment-switch" policy means different captures can switch at 
   different times, and can be coming from different endpoints.  Still 
   using site A as where the speaker is, and "remote" to refer to all 
   the other sites, in segment switching, rather than sending all the 
   images from site A, only the image containing the speaker at site A 
   is shown.  The camera images of the current speaker and previous 
   speakers (if any) are forwarded to the other sites in the 
   conference. 

   Therefore the screens in each site are usually displaying images 
   from different remote sites - the current speaker at site A and the 
   previous ones.  This strategy can be used to preserve full size 
   image display, and also capture the non-verbal communication 
   between the speakers.  In segment switching, the display depends on 
   the activity in the remote rooms - generally, but not necessarily 
   based on audio / speech detection. 

6.3. Simultaneous Transmission Set Constraints 

   The Provider may have constraints or limitations on its ability to 
   send Captures.  One type is caused by the physical limitations of

Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

   capture mechanisms; these constraints are represented by a 
   simultaneous transmission set.  The second type of limitation 
   reflects the encoding resources available - bandwidth and 
   macroblocks/second.  This type of constraint is captured by 
   encoding groups, discussed below. 

   Some Endpoints or MCUs can send multiple Captures simultaneously, 
   however sometimes there are constraints that limit which Captures 
   can be sent simultaneously with other Captures.  A device may not 
   be able to be used in different ways at the same time.  Provider 
   Advertisements are made so that the Consumer can choose one of 
   several possible mutually exclusive usages of the device.  This 
   type of constraint is expressed in a Simultaneous Transmission Set, 
   which lists all the Captures of a particular media type (e.g. 
   audio, video, text) that can be sent at the same time.  There are 
   different Simultaneous Transmission Sets for each media type in the 
   Advertisement.  This is easier to show in an example. 

   Consider the example of a room system where there are three cameras 
   each of which can send a separate capture covering two persons 
   each- VC0, VC1, VC2.  The middle camera can also zoom out (using an 
   optical zoom lens) and show all six persons, VC3.  But the middle 
   camera cannot be used in both modes at the same time - it has to 
   either show the space where two participants sit or the whole six 
   seats, but not both at the same time. 

   Simultaneous transmission sets are expressed as sets of the Media 
   Captures that the Provider could transmit at the same time (though 
   it may not make sense to do so).  In this example the two 
   simultaneous sets are shown in Table 1.  If a Provider advertises 
   one or more mutually exclusive Simultaneous Transmission Sets, then 
   for each media type the Consumer must ensure that it chooses Media 
   Captures that lie wholly within one of those Simultaneous 
   Transmission Sets. 

                           +-------------------+ 
                           | Simultaneous Sets | 
                           +-------------------+ 
                           | {VC0, VC1, VC2}   | 
                           | {VC0, VC3, VC2}   | 
                           +-------------------+ 

                Table 1: Two Simultaneous Transmission Sets

Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

   A Provider optionally can include the simultaneous sets in its 
   provider Advertisement.  These simultaneous set constraints apply 
   across all the Capture Scenes in the Advertisement.  It is a syntax 
   conformance requirement that the simultaneous transmission sets 
   must allow all the media captures in any particular Capture Scene 
   Entry to be used simultaneously. 

   For shorthand convenience, a Provider may describe a Simultaneous 
   Transmission Set in terms of Capture Scene Entries and Capture 
   Scenes.  If a Capture Scene Entry is included in a Simultaneous 
   Transmission Set, then all Media Captures in the Capture Scene 
   Entry are included in the Simultaneous Transmission Set.  If a 
   Capture Scene is included in a Simultaneous Transmission Set, then 
   all its Capture Scene Entries (of the corresponding media type) are 
   included in the Simultaneous Transmission Set.  The end result 
   reduces to a set of Media Captures in any case. 

   If an Advertisement does not include Simultaneous Transmission 
   Sets, then all Capture Scenes can be provided simultaneously.  If 
   multiple capture Scene Entries are in a Capture Scene then the 
   Consumer chooses at most one Capture Scene Entry per Capture Scene 
   for each media type. 

   If an Advertisement includes multiple Capture Scene Entries in a 
   Capture Scene then the Consumer should choose one Capture Scene 
   Entry for each media type, but may choose individual Captures based 
   on the Simultaneous Transmission Sets. 

7. Encodings 

   Individual encodings and encoding groups are CLUE's mechanisms 
   allowing a Provider to signal its limitations for sending Captures, 
   or combinations of Captures, to a Consumer.  Consumers can map the 
   Captures they want to receive onto the Encodings, with encoding 
   parameters they want.    As for the relationship between the CLUE-
   specified mechanisms based on Encodings and the SIP Offer-Answer 
   exchange, please refer to section 4.  

7.1. Individual Encodings 

   An Individual Encoding represents a way to encode a Media Capture 
   to become a Capture Encoding, to be sent as an encoded media stream 
   from the Provider to the Consumer.  An Individual Encoding has a 
   set of parameters characterizing how the media is encoded. 


 
Duckworth et. al.     Expires November 16, 2013         [Page 25] 







Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

   Different media types have different parameters, and different 
   encoding algorithms may have different parameters.  An Individual 
   Encoding can be assigned to at most one Capture Encoding at any 
   given time.  

   The parameters of an Individual Encoding represent the maximum 
   values for certain aspects of the encoding.  A particular 
   instantiation into a Capture Encoding might use lower values than 
   these maximums. 

   In general, the parameters of an Individual Encoding have been 
   chosen to represent those negotiable parameters of media codecs of 
   the media type that greatly influence computational complexity, 
   while abstracting from details of particular media codecs used.  
   The parameters have been chosen with those media codecs in mind 
   that have seen wide deployment in the video conferencing and 
   Telepresence industry.   

   For video codecs (using H.26x compression technologies), those 
   parameters include: 

     . Maximum bitrate; 
     . Maximum picture size in pixels; 
     . Maxmimum number of pixels to be processed per second; and 
     . Clue-protocol internal information. 

   For audio codecs, so far only one parameter has been identified: 

     . Maximum bitrate. 

    

   Edt. note: the maximum number of pixel per second are currently 
   expressed as H.264maxmbps. 

   Edt. note: it would be desirable to make the computational 
   complexity mechanism codec independent so to allow for expressing 
   that, say, H.264 codecs are less complex than H.265 codecs, and, 
   therefore, the same hardware can process higher pixel rates for 
   H.264 than for H.265.  To be discussed in the WG.

7.2. Encoding Group 

   An Encoding Group includes a set of one or more Individual 
   Encodings, and parameters that apply to the group as a whole.  By 
   grouping multiple individual Encodings together, an Encoding Group 
   describes additional constraints on bandwidth and other parameters 
   for the group.   

   The Encoding Group data structure contains: 

     . Maximum bitrate for all encodings in the group combined; 
     . Maximum number of pixels per second for all video encodings of 
        the group combined.  
     . A list of identifiers for audio and video encodings, 
        respectively, belonging to the group. 

    

    

   When the Individual Encodings in a group are instantiated into 
   Capture Encodings, each Capture Encoding has a bitrate that must be 
   less than or equal to the max bitrate for the particular individual 
   encoding.  The "maximum bitrate for all encodings in the group" 
   parameter gives the additional restriction that the sum of all the 
   individual capture encoding bitrates must be less than or equal to 
   the this group value. 

   Likewise, the sum of the pixels per second of each instantiated 
   encoding in the group must not exceed the group value. 

   The following diagram illustrates one example of the structure of a 
   media provider's Encoding Groups and their contents.

                    Figure 1: Encoding Group Structure 

   A Provider advertises one or more Encoding Groups.  Each Encoding 
   Group includes one or more Individual Encodings.  Each Individual 
   Encoding can represent a different way of encoding media.  For 
   example one Individual Encoding may be 1080p60 video, another could 
   be 720p30, with a third being CIF, all in, for example, H.264 
   format. 
    

   While a typical three codec/display system might have one Encoding 
   Group per "codec box" (physical codec, connected to one camera and 
   one screen), there are many possibilities for the number of 
   Encoding Groups a Provider may be able to offer and for the 
   encoding values in each Encoding Group. 

   There is no requirement for all Encodings within an Encoding Group 
   to be instantiated at the same time. 

8. Associating Captures with Encoding Groups 

   Every Capture is associated with an Encoding Group, which is used 
   to instantiate that Capture into one or more Capture Encodings.  
   More than one Capture may use the same Encoding Group. 

   The maximum number of streams that can result from a particular 
   Encoding Group constraint is equal to the number of individual 
   Encodings in the group.  The actual number of Capture Encodings 
   used at any time may be less than this maximum.  Any of the

Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

   Captures that use a particular Encoding Group can be encoded 
   according to any of the Individual Encodings in the group.  If 
   there are multiple Individual Encodings in the group, then the 
   Consumer can configure the Provider, via a Configure message, to 
   encode a single Media Capture into multiple different Capture 
   Encodings at the same time, subject to the Max Capture Encodings 
   constraint, with each capture encoding following the constraints of 
   a different Individual Encoding. 

   It is a protocol conformance requirement that the Encoding Groups 
   must allow all the Captures in a particular Capture Scene Entry to 
   be used simultaneously. 

9. Consumer's Choice of Streams to Receive from the Provider 

   After receiving the Provider's Advertisement message (that includes 
   media captures and associated constraints), the Consumer composes 
   its reply to the Provider in the form of a Configure message.  The 
   Consumer is free to use the information in the Advertisement as it 
   chooses, but there are a few obviously sensible design choices, 
   which are outlined below. 

   If multiple Providers connect to the same Consumer (i.e. in a n 
   MCU-less multiparty call), it is the repsonsibility of the Consumer 
   to compose Configures for each Provider that both fulfill each 
   Provider's constraints as expressed in the Advertisement, as well 
   as its own capabilities. 

   In an MCU-based multiparty call, the MCU can logically terminate 
   the Advertisement/Configure negotiation in that it can hide the 
   characteristics of the receiving endpoint and rely on its own 
   capabilities (transcoding/transrating/...) to create Media Streams 
   that can be decoded at the Endpoint Consumers.  The timing of an 
   MCU's sending of Advertisements (for its outgoing ports) and 
   Configures (for its incoming ports, in response to Advertisements 
   received there) is up to the MCU and implementation dependent.   

   As a general outline, A Consumer can choose, based on the 
   Advertisement it has received, which Captures it wishes to receive, 
   and which Individual Encodings it wants the Provider to use to 
   encode the Captures.  Each Capture has an Encoding Group ID 
   attribute which specifies which Individual Encodings are available 
   to be used for that Capture. 



 
Duckworth et. al.     Expires November 16, 2013         [Page 29] 







Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

   A Configure Message includes a list of Capture Encodings.  These 
   are the Capture Encodings the Consumer wishes to receive from the 
   Provider.  Each Capture Encoding refers to one Media Capture, one 
   Individual Encoding, and includes the encoding parameter values.  
   For each Media Capture in the message, the Consumer may also 
   specify the value of any attributes for which the Provider has 
   offered a choice, for example the value for the Scene-switch-policy 
   attribute.  A Configure Message does not include references to 
   Capture Scenes or Capture Scene Entries. 

   For each Capture the Consumer wants to receive, it configures one 
   or more of the encodings in that capture's encoding group.  The 
   Consumer does this by telling the Provider, in its Configure 
   Message, parameters such as the resolution, frame rate, bandwidth, 
   etc. for each Capture Encodings for its chosen Captures.  Upon 
   receipt of this Configure from the Consumer, common knowledge is 
   established between Provider and Consumer regarding sensible 
   choices for the media streams and their parameters.  The setup of 
   the actual media channels, at least in the simplest case, is left 
   to a following offer-answer exchange.  Optimized implementations 
   may speed up the reaction to the offer-answer exchange by reserving 
   the resources at the time of finalization of the CLUE handshake.  
   Even more advanced devices may choose to establish media streams 
   without an offer-answer exchange, for example by overloading 
   existing 5 tuple connections with the negotiated media. 

   The Consumer must have received at least one Advertisement from the 
   Provider to be able to create and send a Configure.  Each 
   Advertisement is acknowledged by a corresponding Configure. 

   In addition, the Consumer can send a Configure at any time during 
   the call.  The Configure must be valid according to the most 
   recently received Advertisement.  The Consumer can send a Configure 
   either in response to a new Advertisement from the Provider or as 
   by its own, for example because of a local change in conditions 
   (people leaving the room, connectivity changes, multipoint related 
   considerations). 

   The Consumer need not send a new Configure message to the Provider 
   when it receives a new Advertisement from the Provider unless the 
   contents of the new Advertisement cause the Consumer's current 
   Configure message to become invalid.

   Edt. Note: The editors solicit input from the working group as to 
   whether or not a Consumer must respond to every Advertisement with 
   a new Configure message. 

    

   When choosing which Media Streams to receive from the Provider, and 
   the encoding characteristics of those Media Streams, the Consumer 
   advantageously takes several things into account: its local 
   preference, simultaneity restrictions, and encoding limits. 

9.1. Local preference 

   A variety of local factors influence the Consumer's choice of 
   Media Streams to be received from the Provider: 

   o  if the Consumer is an Endpoint, it is likely that it would 
      choose, where possible, to receive video and audio Captures that 
      match the number of display devices and audio system it has 

   o  if the Consumer is a middle box such as an MCU, it may choose to 
      receive loudest speaker streams (in order to perform its own 
      media composition) and avoid pre-composed video Captures 

   o  user choice (for instance, selection of a new layout) may result 
      in a different set of Captures, or different encoding 
      characteristics, being required by the Consumer 

9.2. Physical simultaneity restrictions 

   There may be physical simultaneity constraints imposed by the 
   Provider that affect the Provider's ability to simultaneously send 
   all of the captures the Consumer would wish to receive.  For 
   instance, a middle box such as an MCU, when connected to a multi-
   camera room system, might prefer to receive both individual video 
   streams of the people present in the room and an overall view of 
   the room from a single camera.  Some Endpoint systems might be 
   able to provide both of these sets of streams simultaneously, 
   whereas others may not (if the overall room view were produced by 
   changing the optical zoom level on the center camera, for 
   instance).

Internet-Draft       CLUE Telepresence Framework         May 2013 
 

9.3. Encoding and encoding group limits 

   Each of the Provider's encoding groups has limits on bandwidth and 
   computational complexity, and the constituent potential encodings 
   have limits on the bandwidth, computational complexity, video 
   frame rate, and resolution that can be provided.  When choosing 
   the Captures to be received from a Provider, a Consumer device 
   must ensure that the encoding characteristics requested for each 
   individual Capture fits within the capability of the encoding it 
   is being configured to use, as well as ensuring that the combined 
   encoding characteristics for Captures fit within the capabilities 
   of their associated encoding groups.  In some cases, this could 
   cause an otherwise "preferred" choice of capture encodings to be 
   passed over in favour of different Capture Encodings - for 
   instance, if a set of three Captures could only be provided at a 
   low resolution then a three screen device could switch to favoring 
   a single, higher quality, Capture Encoding. 

10. Extensibility 

   One of the most important characteristics of the Framework is its 
   extensibility.  Telepresence is a relatively new industry and 
   while we can foresee certain directions, we also do not know 
   everything about how it will develop.  The standard for 
   interoperability and handling multiple streams must be future-
   proof. The framework itself is inherently extensible through 
   expanding the data model types.  For example: 

   o  Adding more types of media, such as telemetry, can done by 
      defining additional types of Captures in addition to audio and 
      video. 

   o  Adding new functionalities , such as 3-D, say, may require 
      additional attributes describing the Captures. 

   o  Adding a new codecs, such as H.265, can be accomplished by 
      defining new encoding variables. 

   The infrastructure is designed to be extended rather than 
   requiring new infrastructure elements.  Extension comes through 
   adding to defined types.

   to H264Mbps codepoints, which will be fixed in the next release 
   once an agreement about codec computational complexity has been 
   found.  Other than that, the examples are still valid.

   the Provider, then the Consumer. 

11.1. Provider Behavior 

   This section shows some examples in more detail of how a Provider 
   can use the framework to represent a typical case for telepresence 
   rooms.  First an endpoint is illustrated, then an MCU case is 
   shown. 

11.1.1. Three screen Endpoint Provider 

   Consider an Endpoint with the following description: 

   3 cameras, 3 displays, a 6 person table 

   o  Each camera can provide one Capture for each 1/3 section of the 
      table 

   o  A single Capture representing the active speaker can be provided 
      (voice activity based camera selection to a given encoder input 
      port implemented locally in the Endpoint) 

   o  A single Capture representing the active speaker with the other 
      2 Captures shown picture in picture within the stream can be 
      provided (again, implemented inside the endpoint) 

   o  A Capture showing a zoomed out view of all 6 seats in the room 
      can be provided 

   The audio and video Captures for this Endpoint can be described as 
   follows. 

   Video Captures:

   In this example, the right edge of the VC0 area lines up with the 
   left edge of the VC1 area.  It doesn't have to be this way.  There 
   could be a gap or an overlap.  One additional thing to note for 
   this example is the distance from a to b is equal to the distance 
   from b to c and the distance from c to d.  All these distances are 
   1346 mm. This is the planar width of each area of capture for VC0, 
   VC1, and VC2. 

   Note the text in parentheses (e.g. "the camera-left camera 
   stream") is not explicitly part of the model, it is just 
   explanatory text for this example, and is not included in the 
   model with the media captures and attributes.  Also, the 
   "composed" boolean attribute doesn't say anything about how a 
   capture is composed, so the media consumer can't tell based on 
   this attribute that VC4 is composed of a "loudest panel with 
   PiPs".

   The physical simultaneity information is: 

      Simultaneous transmission set #1 {VC0, VC1, VC2, VC3, VC4, VC6} 

      Simultaneous transmission set #2 {VC0, VC2, VC5, VC6} 

   This constraint indicates it is not possible to use all the VCs at 
   the same time.  VC5 can not be used at the same time as VC1 or VC3 
   or VC4.  Also, using every member in the set simultaneously may 
   not make sense - for example VC3(loudest) and VC4 (loudest with 
   PIP).  (In addition, there are encoding constraints that make 
   choosing all of the VCs in a set impossible.  VC1, VC3, VC4, VC5, 
   VC6 all use EG1 and EG1 has only 3 ENCs.  This constraint shows up 
   in the encoding groups, not in the simultaneous transmission 
   sets.) 

   In this example there are no restrictions on which audio captures 
   can be sent simultaneously. 

   Encoding Groups: 

   This example has three encoding groups associated with the video 
   captures.  Each group can have 3 encodings, but with each 
   potential encoding having a progressively lower specification.  In 
   this example, 1080p60 transmission is possible (as ENC0 has a 
   maxMbps value compatible with that) as long as it is the only 
   active encoding in the group(as maxMbps for the entire encoding 
   group is also 489600).  Significantly, as up to 3 encodings are 
   available per group, it is possible to transmit some video 
   captures simultaneously that are not in the same entry in the 
   capture scene.  For example VC1 and VC3 at the same time. 

   It is also possible to transmit multiple capture encodings of a 
   single video capture.  For example VC0 can be encoded using ENC0 
   and ENC1 at the same time, as long as the encoding parameters 
   satisfy the constraints of ENC0, ENC1, and EG0, such as one at 
   1080p30 and one at 720p30.

   Scene #1 is for the main people captures, and Capture Scene #2 is

   Each row in the table is a separate entry in the capture scene

   Different capture scenes are unique to each other, non-
   overlapping. A consumer can choose an entry from each capture 
   scene.  In this case the three captures VC0, VC1, and VC2 are one 
   way of representing the video from the endpoint.  These three 
   captures should appear adjacent next to each other.  
   Alternatively, another way of representing the Capture Scene is 
   with the capture VC3, which automatically shows the person who is 
   talking.  Similarly for the VC4 and VC5 alternatives. 

   As in the video case, the different entries of audio in Capture 
   Scene #1 represent the "same thing", in that one way to receive 
   the audio is with the 3 audio captures (AC0, AC1, AC2), and 
   another way is with the mixed AC3.  The Media Consumer can choose 
   an audio capture entry it is capable of receiving. 

   The spatial ordering is understood by the media capture attributes 
   area and point of capture. 

   A Media Consumer would likely want to choose a capture scene entry 
   to receive based in part on how many streams it can simultaneously 
   receive.  A consumer that can receive three people streams would 
   probably prefer to receive the first entry of Capture Scene #1

   (VC0, VC1, VC2) and not receive the other entries.  A consumer 
   that can receive only one people stream would probably choose one 
   of the other entries. 

   If the consumer can receive a presentation stream too, it would 
   also choose to receive the only entry from Capture Scene #2 (VC6). 

11.1.2. Encoding Group Example 

   This is an example of an encoding group to illustrate how it can 
   express dependencies between encodings. 

   encodeGroupID=EG0, maxGroupH264Mbps=489600, 
   maxGroupBandwidth=6000000 
       encodeID=VIDENC0, maxWidth=1920, maxHeight=1088, 
   maxFrameRate=60, 
                         maxH264Mbps=244800, maxBandwidth=4000000 
       encodeID=VIDENC1, maxWidth=1920, maxHeight=1088, 
   maxFrameRate=60, 
                         maxH264Mbps=244800, maxBandwidth=4000000 
       encodeID=AUDENC0, maxBandwidth=96000 
       encodeID=AUDENC1, maxBandwidth=96000 
       encodeID=AUDENC2, maxBandwidth=96000 

   Here, the encoding group is EG0.  It can transmit up to two 
   1080p30 capture encodings (Mbps for 1080p = 244800), but it is 
   capable of transmitting a maxFrameRate of 60 frames per second 
   (fps).  To achieve the maximum resolution (1920 x 1088) the frame 
   rate is limited to 30 fps.  However 60 fps can be achieved at a 
   lower resolution if required by the consumer.  Although the 
   encoding group is capable of transmitting up to 6Mbit/s, no 
   individual video encoding can exceed 4Mbit/s. 

   This encoding group also allows up to 3 audio encodings, AUDENC<0-
   2>. It is not required that audio and video encodings reside 
   within the same encoding group, but if so then the group's overall 
   maxBandwidth value is a limit on the sum of all audio and video 
   encodings configured by the consumer.  A system that does not wish 
   or need to combine bandwidth limitations in this way should 
   instead use separate encoding groups for audio and video in order 
   for the bandwidth limitations on audio and video to not interact. 

   Audio and video can be expressed in separate encoding groups, as 
   in this illustration.

11.1.3. The MCU Case 

   This section shows how an MCU might express its Capture Scenes, 
   intending to offer different choices for consumers that can handle 
   different numbers of streams.  A single audio capture stream is 
   provided for all single and multi-screen configurations that can 
   be associated (e.g. lip-synced) with any combination of video 
   captures at the consumer.

11.2. Media Consumer Behavior 

   This section gives an example of how a Media Consumer might behave 
   when deciding how to request streams from the three screen 
   endpoint described in the previous section. 

   The receive side of a call needs to balance its requirements, 
   based on number of screens and speakers, its decoding capabilities 
   and available bandwidth, and the provider's capabilities in order 
   to optimally configure the provider's streams.  Typically it would 
   want to receive and decode media from each Capture Scene 
   advertised by the Provider. 

   A sane, basic, algorithm might be for the consumer to go through 
   each Capture Scene in turn and find the collection of Video 
   Captures that best matches the number of screens it has (this 
   might include consideration of screens dedicated to presentation 
   video display rather than "people" video) and then decide between 
   alternative entries in the video Capture Scenes based either on 
   hard-coded preferences or user choice.  Once this choice has been 
   made, the consumer would then decide how to configure the 
   provider's encoding groups in order to make best use of the 
   available network bandwidth and its own decoding capabilities.  

11.2.1. One screen Media Consumer 

   VC3, VC4 and VC5 are all different entries by themselves, not 
   grouped together in a single entry, so the receiving device should 
   choose between one of those.  The choice would come down to 
   whether to see the greatest number of participants simultaneously 
   at roughly equal precedence (VC5), a switched view of just the 
   loudest region (VC3) or a switched view with PiPs (VC4).  An 
   endpoint device with a small amount of knowledge of these 
   differences could offer a dynamic choice of these options, in-
   call, to the user.

11.2.2. Two screen Media Consumer configuring the example 

   Mixing systems with an even number of screens, "2n", and those 
   with "2n+1" cameras (and vice versa) is always likely to be the 
   problematic case.  In this instance, the behavior is likely to be 
   determined by whether a "2 screen" system is really a "2 decoder" 
   system, i.e., whether only one received stream can be displayed 
   per screen or whether more than 2 streams can be received and 
   spread across the available screen area.  To enumerate 3 possible 
   behaviors here for the 2 screen system when it learns that the far 
   end is "ideally" expressed via 3 capture streams: 

   1. Fall back to receiving just a single stream (VC3, VC4 or VC5 as 
      per the 1 screen consumer case above) and either leave one 
      screen blank or use it for presentation if / when a 
      presentation becomes active. 

   2. Receive 3 streams (VC0, VC1 and VC2) and display across 2 
      screens (either with each capture being scaled to 2/3 of a 
      screen and the center capture being split across 2 screens) or, 
      as would be necessary if there were large bezels on the 
      screens, with each stream being scaled to 1/2 the screen width 
      and height and there being a 4th "blank" panel.  This 4th panel 
      could potentially be used for any presentation that became 
      active during the call. 

   3. Receive 3 streams, decode all 3, and use control information 
      indicating which was the most active to switch between showing 
      the left and center streams (one per screen) and the center and 
      right streams. 

   For an endpoint capable of all 3 methods of working described 
   above, again it might be appropriate to offer the user the choice 
   of display mode. 

11.2.3. Three screen Media Consumer configuring the example 

   This is the most straightforward case - the Media Consumer would 
   look to identify a set of streams to receive that best matched its 
   available screens and so the VC0 plus VC1 plus VC2 should match 
   optimally.  The spatial ordering would give sufficient information 
   for the correct video capture to be shown on the correct screen, 
   and the consumer would either need to divide a single encoding 
   group's capability by 3 to determine what resolution and frame 
   rate to configure the provider with or to configure the individual

   video captures' encoding groups with what makes most sense (taking 
   into account the receive side decode capabilities, overall call 
   bandwidth, the resolution of the screens plus any user preferences 
   such as motion vs sharpness).
