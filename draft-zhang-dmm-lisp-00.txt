    Abstract 

       In traditional Internet architectures, current centralized mobility 
       management solutions face scalability issues due to the creation of 
       network bottlenecks and a single mobility agent of failures. To 
       address these issues, we propose a Distributed Mobility Management 
       solution in Locator/ID Separation Protocol (DMMLISP). We divide the 
       network into many domains according to the area of Autonomous 
       Systems (ASs). Each domain consists of a Mapping Server and several 
       Tunnel Routers (xTRs). The Mapping Server stores global mappings 
       between EID (Endpoint Identifier) prefixes and AS Numbers (ASNs) to 
       lookup the mobile nodes'(MNs') home domain. Meanwhile, the Mapping 
       Server also contains ASN-to-xTR mappings so that it can forward Map-
       Register and Map-Request messages to any xTR of the MN's home domain, 
       thus enhancing reliability. In addition, the xTRs in each domain 
       constitute one-hop DHT (Distributed Hash Table). Moreover, any xTR 
       in the MN's home domain may be the home agent of MNs, and the MNs' 
       EID-to-RLOC (Routing Locator) mapping is stored in two xTRs using 
       two hash functions. In this way, it not only supports quick lookup 
       but also improves scalability and survivability.

    1. Introduction 

       The conventional Internet does not natively support mobility because 
       IP addresses are used as both host identifiers and locators. Many 
       solutions based on the current Internet have been specified to 
       support mobility. Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [MIPv6] as a host-based 
       mobility protocol requires that an MN uses a Home Address (HoA) to 
       indicate its identifier and a Care of Address (CoA) to represent its 
       location information. A home agent (HA) as a location manager 
       maintains HoA-to-CoA mappings and takes charge of forwarding data 
       traffic for MNs. Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [PMIPv6] is a network-
       based mobility protocol in which a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) 
       provides a prefix for an MN as its identifier. The IP address of a 
       Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) is used as the location of an MN, and 
       the LMA keeps the mapping between the MN's prefix and the serving 
       MAG address. In this way, whenever mobility events occur, the HoA or 
       the MN's prefix is unchanged, so it can keep transport connections 
       alive.  

       However, a HA and a LMA can be viewed as centralized mobility agents. 
       All traffic to MNs associated with the HA or the LMA is routed 
       through their agent. Such a centralized mobility solution has some 
       issues [Problem-dmm]. First, when a single mobility agent generally 
       serves a large number of MNs, it becomes a potential bottleneck 
       because all the traffic from and towards an MN has to go through the 
       centralized mobility agent. Second, a centralized mobility agent 
       often results in a non-optimal path. An MN and a correspondent node 
       (CN) may be close to each other but be both far from the mobility 
       agent. Packets destined to the MN need to be forwarded via the 
       mobility agent, which is not the shortest path. If the CoA of an MN 
       is given to the CN in MIPv6 Route Optimization (RO) mode, the 
       location privacy of the MN will be not protected. And we can not 
       expect RO capabilities to exist at each CN. Third, malicious MNs can 
       attack HAs or LMAs directly (e.g. MNs send a large mount of data 
       traffic), so it can bring insecure factors and a single point of 
       failures is more vulnerable. Finally, the current Internet faces 
       serious scaling problems. MIPv6 and PMIPv6 which develop based on 
       the traditional TCP/IP are not suitable for an increasing demand for 
       future Internet scalability.

    Internet-Draft                 dmm-lisp                  September 2012 
        

       To address the above issues, we propose a Distributed Mobility 
       Management in Locator/ID Separation Protocol (DMMLISP), which can 
       improve scalability and survivability of the network. When an MN 
       crosses different subnets, it only changes its RLOC but its EID used 
       by the transport layer's connection is invariable, so it can offer 
       services connectivity and support global roaming [MILSA]. A Tunnel 
       Router (xTR) receives packets from sites on one side [LISP] and 
       encapsulates them with RLOCs toward the Internet on the other side, 
       so routers in the core networks only need to maintain RLOCs, which 
       addresses routing scalability problems [Report-RoutingAddressing]. 
       Meanwhile, we separate the signaling and data planes by introducing 
       the mapping system as an overlay architecture to deliver signaling 
       messages, which avoids evil MNs attacking map servers (MSs) [LISP-MS] 
       directly. In addition, we divide the Internet into different domains 
       according to the coverage area of Autonomous Systems (ASs). Each 
       domain is managed by an MS who takes charge of forwarding Map-
       Request and Map-Register messages for xTRs by storing the global 
       EID-prefix-to-ASN (AS number) and ASN-to-xTR mappings. In this way, 
       even if one MS break down, other MSs can substitute it. 

       In addition, xTRs are distributed in different sites so that packets 
       may be routed via a nearby router. In this way, all the data between 
       two xTRs near to hosts can be transited on the shortest path. Hence, 
       it can help reduce the delay and overhead. Meanwhile, the xTRs in 
       each domain constitute one-hop DHT (Distributed Hash Table). We 
       store the MN's EID-to-RLOC mappings in two xTRs, avoiding a single 
       point of failures.  

    2. Definition of items 

       Autonomous System (AS): Within the Internet, an autonomous system is 
         a collection of connected IP routing prefixes under the control of 
         one or more network operators that presents a common, clearly 
         defined routing policy to the Internet. 
        
       Endpoint ID (EID): An EID is a 32-bit (for IPv4) or 128-bit (for IPv6) 
         value used in the source and destination address fields of the 
         first (most inner) LISP header of a packet. An EID is allocated to 
         a host from an EID-prefix block associated with the site where the 
         host is located. See [LISP] for details. 
        
       Routing Locator (RLOC): A RLOC is an IPv4 or IPv6 address of an 
         egress tunnel router (ETR). A RLOC is the output of an EID-to-RLOC 
         mapping lookup. An EID maps to one or more RLOCs. Typically, RLOCs 

     
     
    Zhang et al.           Expires March 4, 2013                   [Page 4] 
        

    Internet-Draft                 dmm-lisp                  September 2012 
        

         are numbered based on the connectivity of provider networks. See 
         [LISP] for details. 
        
       EID-prefix: An EID-prefix is a power-of-two block of EIDs which are 
         allocated to a site by an address allocation authority. EID-prefix 
         allocations can be broken up into smaller blocks when an RLOC set 
         is to be associated with the smaller EID-prefix.  
        
       EID-to-RLOC mapping: a binding between an EID or EID-prefix and a 
         RLOC set which can be used to reach the EID. The xTRs can 
         encapsulate packets with the RLOC in the EID-to-RLOC mapping to 
         reach the destination EID. A RLOC set may contain multiple RLOCs to 
         perform multihoming or traffic engineering.  
        
       Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR): An ITR accepts an IP packet and prepends 
         an "outer" header with RLOCs. It sends a Map-request to the mapping 
         system when it does not have the EID-to-RLOC mapping for the 
         destination EID. 
        
       Egress Tunnel Router (ETR): An ETR accepts packets with the RLOCs as 
         the destination addresses. It strips the outer header and forwards 
         packets based on EIDs. 
        
       xTR: A xTR is a reference to an ITR or ETR when direction of data 
         flow is not part of the context description. xTR refers to the 
         router that is the tunnel endpoint. 
        
       Mapping Server (MS): A Mapping Server is a component, which stores 
         the EID-prefix-to-ASN and ASN-to-xTR mappings. The MS forwards Map-
         Register or Map-Request messages to xTRs. 
        
       Mapping Domain (MD): This document defines the area that a Mapping 
         Server covers as a Mapping Domain. 
        
       EID-prefix-to-ASN mapping: It indicates which AS EID-prefix belongs 
         to. 
        
       ASN-to-xTR mapping: A binding between ASN and the xTR, which is one-
         to-many relationship.

                         Figure 1 :Architecture of DMMLISP 

       Figure 1 shows the architecture of DMMLISP, which is divided into 
       different domains according to the coverage area of the AS. Each 
       domain is managed by an MS who stores EID-prefix-to-ASN and ASN-to-
       xTR mappings. All the xTRs in the same AS constitute one-hop DHT and 
       maintain EID-to-RLOC mappings. 

       Each xTR collects local EID-prefixes and notifies these prefixes to 
       the associated MS. MSs advertise their EID-prefix-to-ASN mappings 
       each other through BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) extension, so each 
       MS can know global EID-prefixes. In this way, it is possible to 
       aggregate local prefixes efficiently in an AS so that it can 
       alleviate the stored overload in the MS. Moreover, the change of the 
     
     
    Zhang et al.           Expires March 4, 2013                   [Page 6] 
        

    Internet-Draft                 dmm-lisp                  September 2012 
        

       topology within an AS does not impact on the mappings between EID-
       prefix-to-ASN mappings in other MSs. Thus, the mapping system is 
       more scalability and stable. 

       In addition, the MS also maintains the ASN-to-xTR mappings, which is 
       one-to-many relationship. When the MS receives Map-Register or Map-
       Request messages, it randomly selects one of xTRs as the destination 
       xTR (DxTR) and forwards these messages to the DxTR. Even if the DxTR 
       fails, any other xTRs in the destination AS can replace it by 
       reselecting other DxTRs. Hence, it enhances the survivability of 
       DMMLISP. 

       There are two ways to replace a broken MS. One way is that MSs use 
       BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), which entablishes on TCP. If one MS 
       breaks down, the peer MS can detect that the TCP connection is 
       broken and replaces the broken MS. Because each MS maintains ASN-to-
       xTR mappings, the peer MS can notify all the xTRs in the AS of the 
       broken MS. In this way, the MS can replace the broken MS. Another 
       way is we replicate an MS in each AS. One MS is primary and the 
       other is for backup. 

       We deploy one-hop DHT ring in each AS. Any xTRs in the DHT ring may 
       be the agent of MNs, which inherits the advantages on scalability 
       and robustness of the DHT-based infrastructure. We store the MN's 
       EID-to-RLOC mapping in two xTRs. The DxTR uses different hash 
       functions to map the MN's EID to two home xTRs (HxTR) in order to 
       avoid a single point of failures. Hence, it can enhance the

                         Figure 2 : Host Mobility Scenario 

       Fig. 2 illustrates the message flows for host mobility. When an MN 
       moves from the coverage area of the xTR1 to the xTR2, it connects to 
       the xTR2 (Message 1). Then, the xTR2 checks whether the EID belongs 
       to its local AS or not. If yes, it indicates that this AS is the 
       home domain of the MN. The xTR2 hashes the EID to find its HxTR and 
       updates the MN's EID-to-RLOC mapping in the HxTR. If not, it 
       indicates that the MN has left its home domain, the xTR2 sends a 
       Map-Register message to its local MS (Message 2). 

       Each MS stores two tables: an EID-prefix-to-ASN table and an ASN-to-
       xTR table. When receiving a Map-Register message, the MS lookups the 
       EID-prefix-to-ASN table to obtain the MN's home AS number. Then, it 
       lookups the ASN-to-xTR table and randomly chooses one xTR as the 
       DxTR. After that, the MS forwards the Map-Register message to the 
       DxTR (Message 3). 

       Once receiving the Map-Register message, the DxTR uses the MN's EID 
       as a key and hashes it in order to obtain the MN's HxTR. The HxTR 
       stores the mapping between the EID and the RLOC. To improve the 
       survivability of the system, we use two Hash functions and store the 
       EID-to-RLOC mapping in two HxTRs (Message 4). Even if one HxTR 
       breaks down, the other can replace it and respond to the Map-Request 
       message. 

       In addition, the xTR2 sends a location update message to the xTR1 
       (message 5) including the new MN's EID-to-RLOC mapping. Then, xTR1 
       sends a message to the correspondent's xTRs (CxTR) in order to

       update the new MN's mapping information in the CxTR's mapping table 
       (message 6). Once the CxTR obtains the new mapping, packets destined 
       to the MN are directly forwarded to the xTR2, so that it is not 
       necessary to pass through the old xTR1. Thus, the scheme can achieve 
       route optimization. 

    3.3. Call delivery procedure 

       Fig. 3 illustrates the message flows for the call delivery procedure. 
       When a CN wants to communicate with an MN, it sends packets to the 
       CxTR using its EID and the MN's EID as the packets's source address 
       and destination address (Message 1). The CxTR checks whether the EID 
       belongs to the local AS. If the MN's home domain and the CxTR are 
       different, the CxTR sends a Map-Request message to the associated MS 
       (Message 2). The MS lookups the EID-prefix-to-ASN table and obtains 
       the home AS of the MN. Then, the MS lookups the ASN-to-xTR table in 
       order to find one of its home domain's DxTRs, and forwards the Map-
       Request message to the DxTR (Message 3). If the MS does not receive 
       the response message of the DxTR, it will choose another DxTR and 
       send the Map-Request message to the DxTR. As long as one DxTR of the 
       MN's home domain is active, the signalling can be forwarded to the 
       DxTR. In this way, the survivability of the system is enhanced. 

       The DxTR randomly selects one of two hash functions to find the MN's 
       HxTR and then forwards the Map-Request message to it (Message 4). 
       The HxTR responds to a Map-Reply Message including the EID-to-RLOC 
       mapping to the CxTR (Message 5). Then, the CxTR encapsulates packets 
       with RLOCs and sends them to the xTR which the MN attaches to. When 
       receiving packets, the xTR of the MN strips the encapsulated header 
       and forwards them to the MN (Message 6).

    4. Properties of DMMLISP 

    4.1. Optimize path 

       In PMIPv6 and MIPv6, the LMA or the HA is required to deliver data 
       packets and they as location managers need to encapsulate packets. 

       In DMMLISP, xTRs are distributed in different access networks so 
       that data packets may be routed via a nearby xTR without passing 
       through MSs. In this way, compared to PMIPv6 and MIPv6, there is not 
       an extra encapsulated overhead on location managers. Moreover, the 
       data transmission delay can be reduced. 

    4.2. Split the signaling and the data 

       The mapping system as an overlay architecture on the top of the 
       Internet is used to deliver signaling messages. The mapping system 
       consists of many MSs who manage mobility-related signaling. 
       Meanwhile, the locator/ID separation avoids evil MNs sending a great 
       many data to MSs. Thus, it can offer better controllability, 
       manageability and security. 

    4.3. Improve survivability 

       Each MS stores the global EID-prefix-to-ASN mappings. In this way, 
       even if one MS breaks down, other MSs can replace its function to

    Internet-Draft                 dmm-lisp                  September 2012 
        

       forward Map-Request and Map-Register messages. In addition, we store 
       the MN's EID-to-RLOC mapping in two HxTRs via two hash functions, so 
       the HxTR is also alternative. Thus, our scheme can enhance the 
       survivability of DMMLISP. 

    4.4. Hide location information of MNs 

       In LISP networks, a CN only knows the MN's identifier but location 
       information of the MN is hidden to the CN, which avoids malicious 
       CNs attacking MNs directly. 

    4.5. Network-based mobility management 

       The MN is not required to participate in any mobility-related 
       signaling, so the proposed scheme avoids a part of signaling 
       overhead in wireless links and makes use of wireless resources 
       efficiently. Moreover, our network-based mobility management 
       solution does not require any modification on the MNs. 

    4.6. Support routing scalability 

       One of aims for the Locator/ID separation solution is to support 
       routing scalability by removing hosts' EIDs from core routers in the 
       current routing system. After packets which are sent by a host 
       arrive at an xTR, they are encapsulated with RLOCs and then are 
       forwarded to its destination xTR. We design a distributed mobility 
       management solution based on LISP which does not damage the 
       architecture and can solve both global routing scalability problems 
       and mobility support.
