    <abstract>
      <t>
        This document specifies optional things that one can do
		with "ni" URIs and related names. Those include 
		an additional hash algorithm for handling dynamic content,
        some specific query-strong parameters for ni URIs and
		a mechanism for embedding ni URIs into QR codes.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>

		<section title="Introduction">

		<t>The ni URI scheme <xref target="nischeme"/> supports extensibility
		in terms of the algorithm used to derive a value (normally, but not
		always a strong digest algorithm) and via support for a query-string
		thay can contain a list of key=value pairs. This document defines 
		some uses for both of these extensibility points and creates IANA
		registries that can be used to register additional algorithms and 
		key strings for use in the
		query part of an ni name. We [[will]] also define a way to embed ni names 
		in QR codes.
		</t>

        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
          document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
        </t>

		<t>[[Comments are included in double-square brackets, like this.]]</t>

		<t>[[Note that the features here are less mature than the
		specification in the <xref target="nischeme"/> document. The intent is to develop these
		as required for the various use-cases as we go. If something from
		here appears to be as widely useful as the core ni scheme, then
		the authors are willing to move features from this document to
		the core document. We are also happy to incoroporate features
		to handle additional use-cases here if those arise.]]
		</t>

		</section>

		<section title="Additional Algorithm">

	
		<t>This section specifies an additional algorithm that MAY be used
		to handle hashes calculated over dynamically
		changing objects.
		</t>

		<section title="Hashed Dynamic Content" anchor="dynamic">

		<t>The ni scheme involves calculating digest values over content objects.
		That works fine with static objects but is problematic for objects 
		whose value is dynamically generated. In this section we define an
		algorithm that supports the same core "name-data integrity" service
		for dynamic objects. The basic idea is simply to include a hash of
		a public key in the ni name, and then for the dynamic object to 
		be digitally signed with the corresponding private key. With a 
		little work to handle the various useful formats, this allows a
		client that is presented with the ni name and the signed object
		to verify the binding between the name and the object data.
		</t>

		<t>Note that the signature scheme used might or might not 
		provide additional information, e.g. a name for the signer. 
		Applications might benefit from that, but it is not required
		in order to provide the core "name-data integrity" service
		for dynamically generated objects.
		</t>

		<t>Since there are a number of digital signing schemes that
		might be used, our approach is to define a new algorithm for
		the ni scheme that takes as input a specific public key 
		encoded in a specific way, and runs that through a digest
		function. That is, the ni algorithm fields will specify 
		both a public key algorithm and a digest algorithm, just
		as is done with digital signature algorithm identifiers.
		</t>

		<t>

		  Since it is possible that an ni algorithm might also
		  be defined where the value contains an actual
		  digital signature we need to be careful to ensure
		  there is no ambiguity.  However, since the lengths
		  of signatures and hash outputs are (with current
		  algorithms) always different, we could use that
		  fact to disambigute between rsa-with-sha256 meaning
		  the value is a sha256 hash of an rsa public key and
		  the alternative meaning the the value is an
		  rsa-with-sha256 signature. However, we prefer to
		 use a new algorithm (see <xref target="IANAcons"/> to
		disambiguate these. 
		</t>

		<t>
		We define one such algorithm, "pk-rsa-with-sha256" that
		takes an RSA public key as input, with the input 
		bits formatted as a SubjectPublicKeyInfo as defined
		by <xref target="nischeme"/> Note that this
		does not mean that one cannot use e.g. PGP to 
		sign the actual object. It means that if you do 
		use PGP then in order to verify the name-data 
		integrity, the client needs to extract the signer's
		PGP public key, then reformat that as a 
		SubjectPublicKeyInfo and then run that through 
		the sha-256 algorithm and make the relevant 
		comparison.
		</t>

		</section>

		</section>

		<section title="Query String Paramaeters">

		<t>This section defines query string parameters that MAY be
		used to indicate the type of content hashed or to specify 
		additional locations from which the named content can be
		retrieved. We also define a way to specify how an 
		encryption key MAY be included in an ni URI that allows
		for decryption of object content.</t>

        <section title="Digest with Content Type">
          <t>
          The semantics of a digest being used to establish a secure
          reference from an authenticated source to an external source
          may be a function of associated meta data such as the content
          type. This data MAY be specified by means of a parameter:
          </t>
          <t>ni:///sha-256;B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc?ct=text/plain</t>
        <t>
          The Content Type "ct" parameter specifies the MIME Content Type of
          the associated data as defined in <xref target="RFC4288" />
        </t>
        </section>
CTOUT-->

        <section title="Additional Locators">
          <t>
            In addition to the algorithm for mapping an ni URI to an HTTP(S) URL 
			specified in the ni scheme definition <xref target="nischeme"/>, an ni name MAY provide 
			information about additional locations from which the referenced content
             might be available. This is done via the inclusion of an "alt" or "alts"
			key in the query string that can supply more values for the authority 
			field when constructing the HTTP or HTTPS URL.  For example:
          </t>
          <t>ni://example.com/sha-256;B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc?alt=ni.example.net</t>
          <t>
            The corresponding content might then also be retrieved from the URL:
          </t>
          <t>
            http://ni.example.net/.well-known/ni/sha-256/B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc
          </t>
          <t>
            A ni name MAY specify multiple locations from which the
            content MAY be obtained:
          </t>
          <t>
	    ni:///sha-256;B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc?alt=one.example.com&amp;alt=two.example.com
	  </t>
          <t>
            The above example asserts that the content might be retrieved from either of the following URIs:
          </t>
          <t>
            http://one.example.com/.well-known/ni/sha-256/B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc
			</t>
			<t>
            http://two.example.com/.well-known/ni/sha-256/B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc
          </t>

		<t>The "alt" parameter means "use HTTP" and the "alts" parameter means 
		use "HTTPS". </t>

        <t>
          The alt and alts parameters are used to specify a possible
          means of resolving the referenced content. Multiple
          locator parameters MAY be used to specify alternative sources
          for accessing the content.
        </t>
        <t>
          The alt and alts parameters take a single argument, the
          authority to be used for resolution. To permit the use
          of ni URIs in ASCII-only environments, the ASCII encoding
          (aka punycode) of the domain name MUST be used. [[Not sure
			if this is needed/correct.]]
        </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Digest with Decryption Key">
          <t>
            An ni name MAY provide a key for decrypting the referenced
            data. The use-case here is where the referenced data has be 
			distributed (somehow) in ciphertext form, probably with little
			or no access control required (since the data is strongly 
			encrypted) and where a client wishing to decrypt that data
			subsequently acquires an ni name for that data that provides
			the required decryption key.
			</t>
			<t>
			Clearly, to be of any benefit, access to the ni name that
			includes the decryption key MUST be controlled so that
			only the appropriate clients get access to the ni name
			and of course this ni name MUST be strongly protected
			via some (probably mutual) authentication and confidentiality 
			service such as can be provided by TLS. <xref target="RFC5246"/>
          </t>
          <t>ni///:sha-256;B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc?enc=aes-cbc:Fw3x20nEKfq6FDGzq7ttIQ</t>

        <t>
          The "enc" specifier is used when the encrypted object consists of
          the ciphertext alone. The "menc" spcifier is used when the
          encrypted object consists of a MIME header containing metadata
          followed by the binary object encoding. [[Note: there may be more
			needed here.]]
        </t>
        <t>
          The encryption specifiers both take an agrument of the form:
        </t>
        <t>
          algorithm ":" base64url (key) [":"  base64url (iv)]
        </t>

        <t>
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="algorithm">
              Is the algorithm used to encrypt the associated content
            </t>

              Is the value of the cryptographic Initialization Vector.
            </t>
            <t>
              If the IV is not spcified for a block cipher mode that
              requires one, the IV MUST be prepended to the encrypted
              content.
            </t>
            <t>
              [[Note: Actually the IV does not provide any additional security for
              this application but explaining the reason might be more
              effort than it is worth and what we really care about is saving
              bytes in the identifier, not the resulting data package.]

		<section title="Wrapped URL" anchor="wrapped">

		<t>The "ni" URI form can usefully "wrap" an HTTP URL in order to provide
