Internet-Draft        Home Documents for HTTP APIs              May 2012


1.  Introduction

   There is an emerging preference for non-browser Web applications
   (colloquially, "HTTP APIs") to use a link-driven approach to their
   interactions to assure loose coupling, thereby enabling extensibility
   and API evolution.

   This is based upon experience with previous APIs which specified
   static URI paths (such as
   "http://api.example.com/v1.0/widgets/abc123/properties") have
   resulted in brittle, tight coupling between clients and servers.

   Sometimes, these APIs are documented by a document format like
   WADL [1] that is used as a "design-time" description; i.e., the URIs
   and other information they describe are "baked into" client
   implementations.

   In contrast, a "follow your nose" API advertises the resources
   available to clients using link relations [RFC5988] and the formats
   they support using internet media types [RFC4288].  A client can then
   decide - at "run time" - which resources to interact with based upon
   its capabilities (as described by link relations), and the server can
   safely add new resources and formats without disturbing clients that
   are not yet aware of them.

   As such, the client needs to be able to discover this information
   quickly and efficiently use it to interact with the server.  Just as
   with a human-targeted "home page" for a site, we can create a "home
   document" for a HTTP API (often, at the same URI, found through
   server-driven content negotiation) that describes it to non-browser
   clients.

   Of course, an HTTP API might use any format to do so; however, there
   are advantages to having a standard home document format.  This
   specification suggests one for consideration, using the JSON format
   [RFC4627].


2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  JSON Home Documents

   A JSON Home Document uses the format described in [RFC4627] and has

Internet-Draft        Home Documents for HTTP APIs              May 2012


   the media type "application/json-home".

   Its content consists of a root object with a "resources" property,
   whose names are link relation types (as defined by [RFC5988]), and
   values are Resource Objects, defined below.

   For example:

   GET / HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Accept: application/json-home

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json-home
   Cache-Control: max-age=3600
   Connection: close

   {
     "resources": {
       "http://example.org/rel/widgets": {
         "href": "/widgets/"
       },
       "http://example.org/rel/widget": {
         "href-template": "/widgets/{widget_id}",
         "href-vars": {
           "widget_id": "http://example.org/param/widget"
         },
         "hints": {
           "allow": ["GET", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH"],
           "representations": ["application/json"],
           "accept-patch": ["application/json-patch"],
           "accept-post": ["application/xml"],
           "accept-ranges": ["bytes"]
         }
       }
     }
   }

   Here, we have a home document that links two a resource, "/widgets/"
   with the relation "http://example.org/rel/widgets", and also links to
   one or more with the relation type "http://example.org/rel/widget"
   using a URI Template [RFC6570].

   It also gives several hints about interacting with the latter
   "widget" resources, including the HTTP methods usable with them, the
   patch formats they accept, and the fact that they support partial
   requests [RFC2616] using the "bytes" range-specifier.

   It gives no such hints about the "widgets" resource.  This does not
   mean that it (for example) doesn't support any HTTP methods; it means
   that the client will need to discover this by interacting with the
   resource, and/or examining the documentation for its link relation
   type.


4.  Resource Objects

   A Resource Object links to resources of the defined type using one of
   two mechanisms; either a direct link (in which case there is exactly
   one resource of that relation type associated with the API), or a
   templated link, in which case there are zero to many such resources.

   Direct links are indicated with an "href" property, whose value is a
   URI [RFC3986].

   Templated links are indicated with an "href-template" property, whose
   value is a URI Template [RFC6570].  When "href-template" is present,
   the Resource Object MUST have a "href-vars" property; see "Resolving
   Templated Links".

   Resource Objects MUST have exactly one of the "href" and "href-vars"
   properties.

   In both forms, the links that "href" and "href-template" refer to are
   URI-references [RFC3986] whose base URI is that of the JSON Home
   Document itself.

   Resource Objects MAY also have a "hints" property, whose value is an
   object that uses named Resource Hints as its properties.

4.1.  Resolving Templated Links

   A URI can be derived from a Templated Link by treating the "href-
   template" value as a Level 3 URI Template [RFC6570], using the "href-
   vars" property to fill the template.

   The "href-vars" property, in turn, is an object that acts as a
   mapping between variable names available to the template and absolute
   URIs that are used as global identifiers for the semantics and syntax
   of those variables.

   For example, given the following Resource Object:

Internet-Draft        Home Documents for HTTP APIs              May 2012


   "http://example.org/rel/widget": {
     "href-template": "/widgets/{widget_id}",
     "href-vars": {
       "widget_id": "http://example.org/param/widget"
     },
     "hints": {
       "allow": ["GET", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH"],
       "representations": ["application/json"],
       "accept-patch": ["application/json-patch"],
       "accept-post": ["application/xml"],
       "accept-ranges": ["bytes"]
     }
   }

   If you understand that "http://example.org/param/widget" is an
   numeric identifier for a widget (perhaps by dereferencing that URL
   and reading the documentation), you can then find the resource
   corresponding to widget number 12345 at
   "http://example.org/widgets/12345" (assuming that the Home Document
   is located at "http://example.org/").


5.  Resource Hints

   Resource hints allow clients to find relevant information about
   interacting with a resource beforehand, as a means of optimising
   communications, as well as advertising available behaviours (e.g., to
   aid in laying out a user interface for consuming the API).

   Hints are just that - they are not a "contract", and are to only be
   taken as advisory.  The runtime behaviour of the resource always
   overrides hinted information.

   For example, a resource might hint that the PUT method is allowed on
   all "widget" resources. this means that generally, the user has the
   ability to PUT to a particular resource, but a specific resource may
   reject a PUT based upon access control or other considerations.  More
   fine-grained information might be gathered by interacting with the
   resource (e.g., via a GET), or by another resource "containing" it
   (such as a "widgets" collection).

   This specification defines a set of common hints, based upon
   information that's discoverable by directly interacting with
   resources.  A future draft will explain how to define new hints.

5.1.  allow

   Hints the HTTP methods that the current client will be able to use to
   interact with the resource; equivalent to the Allow HTTP response
   header.

   Content MUST be an array of strings, containing HTTP methods.

5.2.  representations

   Hints the representation types that the resource produces and
   consumes, using the GET and PUT methods respectively, subject to the
   'allow' hint.

   Content MUST be an array of strings, containing media types.

5.3.  accept-patch

   Hints the PATCH request formats accepted by the resource for this
   client; equivalent to the Accept-Patch HTTP response header.

   Content MUST be an array of strings, containing media types.

5.4.  accept-post

   Hints the POST request formats accepted by the resource for this
   client.

   Content MUST be an array of strings, containing media types.

5.5.  accept-ranges

   Hints the range-specifiers available to the client for this resource;
   equivalent to the Accept-Ranges HTTP response header.

   Content MUST be an array of strings, containing HTTP range-
   specifiers.


6.  Creating and Serving Home Documents

   When making a home document available, there are a few things to keep
   in mind:

   o  A home document is best located at a memorable URI, because its
      URI will effectively become the URI for the API itself to clients.





Nottingham              Expires November 10, 2012               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Home Documents for HTTP APIs              May 2012


   o  Home documents can be personalised, just as "normal" home pages
      can.  For example, you might advertise different URIs, and/or
      different kinds of link relations, depending on the client's
      identity.
   o  Home documents SHOULD be assigned a freshness lifetime (e.g.,
      "Cache-Control: max-age=3600") so that clients can cache them, to
      avoid having to fetch it every time the client interacts with the
      service.
   o  Custom link relation types, as well as the URIs for variables,
      should lead to documentation for those constructs.

6.1.  Managing Change in Home Documents

   The URIs used in home documents MAY change over time.  However,
   changing them can cause issues for clients that are relying on cached
   home documents containing old links.

   To mitigate these risks, servers changing links SHOULD consider:

   o  Reducing the freshness lifetime of home documents before a link
      change, so that clients are less likely to refer to an "old"
      document
   o  Assure that they handle requests for the "old" URIs appropriately;
      e.g., with a 404 Not Found, or by redirecting the client to the
      new URI.
   o  Alternatively, considering the "old" and "new" URIs as equally
      valid references for an "overlap" period.

   Generally, servers ought not to change URIs without good cause.

6.2.  Evolving and Mixing APIs with Home Documents

   Using home documents affords the opportunity to change the "shape" of
   the API over time, without breaking old clients.

   This includes introducing new functions alongside the old ones - by
   adding new link relation types with corresponding resource objects -
   as well as adding new template variables, media types, and so on.

   It's important to realise that a home document can serve more than
   one "API" at a time; by listing all relevant relation types, it can
   effectively "mix" different APIs, allowing clients to work with
   different resources as they see fit.

6.3.  Documenting APIs that use Home Documents

   Another use case for "static" API description formats like WSDL and
   WADL is to generate documentation for the API from them.



Nottingham              Expires November 10, 2012               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        Home Documents for HTTP APIs              May 2012


   An API that uses the home document format correctly won't have a need
   to do so, provided that the link relation types and media types it
   uses are well-documented already.


7.  Consuming Home Documents

   Clients might use home documents in a variety of ways.

   In the most common case - actually consuming the API - the client
   will scan the Resources Object for the link relation(s) that it is
   interested in, and then to interact with the resource(s) referred to.
   Resource Hints can be used to optimise communication with the client,
   as well as to inform as to the permissible actions (e.g., whether PUT
   is likely to be supported).

   Note that the home document is a "living" document; it does not
   represent a "contract", but rather is expected to be inspected before
   each interaction.  In particular, links from the home document MUST
   NOT be assumed to be valid beyond the freshness lifetime of the home
   document, as per HTTP's caching model [RFC2616].

   As a result, clients SHOULD cache the home document (as per
   [RFC2616], to avoid fetching it before every interaction (which would
   otherwise be required).

   Likewise, a client encountering a 404 Not Found on a link SHOULD
   obtain a fresh copy of the home document, to assure that it is up-to-
   date.

Appendix A.  Frequently Asked Questions

A.1.  Why not Microformats?

   Browser-centric Web applications use HTML as their representation
   format of choice.  While it is possible to augment HTML for non-
   browser clients (using techniques like Microformats [2] ), a few
   issues become evident when doing so:

   o  HTML has a very forgiving syntax.  While this is appropriate for
      browsers (especially considering that there are many million HTML
      authors in the world), it makes for a less-than-precise language
      for machines, resulting in both overhead (parsing and
      transmission) as well as lack of precision.
   o  HTML is presentation-centric, making it tempting to reformat it
      from time to time, to improve the "look and feel" of a page.
      However, doing so can cause comparatively brittle non-browser
      clients to lose their understanding of the content's semantics,
      unless very careful controls are in place.




Nottingham              Expires November 10, 2012              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft        Home Documents for HTTP APIs              May 2012


   Because of this, it's most practical to define a separate format, and
   JSON is easily machine-readable, precise, and has a better chance of
   being managed for stability.

A.2.  What about authentication?

   In HTTP, authentication is discoverable by interacting with the
   resource (usually, by getting a 401 Unauthorized response status
   code, along with one or more challenges).  While the home document
   could hint it, this isn't yet done, to avoid possible security
   complications.

A.3.  What about "Faults" (i.e., errors)?

   In HTTP, errors are conveyed by HTTP status codes.  While this
   specification could (and even may) allow enumeration of possible
   error conditions, there's a concern that this will encourage
   applications to define many such "faults", leading to tight coupling
   between the application and its clients.

   So, this is an area of possible future development; if any such
   mechanism appears here, it's likely to be quite restricted.

A.4.  How Do I find the XML Schema / JSON Schema / etc. for a particular
      media type?

   That isn't addressed by home documents.  Ultimately, it's up to the
   media type accepted and generated by resources to define and
   constrain (or not) their syntax.


Appendix B.  Open Issues

   The following is a list of placeholders for open issues.

   o  Refining and extending representation formats - "application/xml",
      for example, isn't enough.  While a media type for every
      representation is one answer, something like 'profile' might be
      good too.
   o  Object for contact details - do we need an object that describes
      who's running the API, etc?
   o  Defining new hints - guidance is needed on minting new hints.
      Possibly a registry.
   o  Defining new top-level properties - how new ones are minted,
      registry, etc.
   o  Defining new Resource Object properties - how new ones are minted,
      registry, etc.
