    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t> IKEv2, as specified in section 2.16 of <xref target="RFC5996"/>, allows authentication of 
        the initiator using an EAP method. Using EAP significantly increases the count of 
        round-trips required to establish the IPsec SA, and also may require user interaction. This 
        makes it inconvenient to allow a single remote access client to create multiple IPsec 
        tunnels with multiple IPsec gateways that belong to the same domain.</t> 
      <t> The EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP), as described in <xref target="RFC5296bis"/>, 
        allows an EAP peer to authenticate to multiple authenticators, while performing the full 
        EAP method only once. Subsequent authentications require fewer round-trips and no user 
        interaction.</t>
      <t> Bringing these two technologies together allows a remote access IPsec client to create
        multiple tunnels with different gateways that belong to a single domain, as well as using 
        the keys from other contexts of using EAP, such as network access within the same domain,
        to transparently connect to VPN gateways within this domain.</t>

      <section anchor="scenarios" title="Usage Scenarios">
        <t> This work is motivated by the following scenarios:<list style="symbols">
          <t> Multiple tunnels for a single remote access VPN client. Suppose a company has offices
            in New York City, Paris, and Shanghai. For historical reasons, the email server is 
            located in the Paris office, while most of the servers hosting the company's intranet
            are located in Shanghai, and the finance department servers are in NYC. An employee 
            using remote access VPN may need to connect to servers from all three locations. While
            it is possible to connect to a single gateway, and have that gateway route the requests
            to the other gateways (perhaps through site to site VPN), this is not efficient, and it
            is more desirable to have the client initiate three different tunnels. It is, however, 
            not desirable to have the user type in a password three times.</t>
          <t> Roaming. In these days of mobile phones and tablets, users often move from the 
            wireless LAN in their office, where access may be granted through 802.1x, to a cellular
            network where VPN is necessary and back again. Both the VPN server and the 802.1x
            access point are authenticators that connect to the same AAA servers. So it makes sense
            to make the transition smooth, without requiring user interaction. The device still
            needs to detect whether it is within the protected network, in which case it should not
            use VPN, but this process is beyond the scope of this document. 
            <xref target="SecureBeacon"/> is a now-abandoned attempt at this.</t></list></t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="outline" title="Protocol Outline">
        <t> Supporting ERX requires an EAP payload in the first IKE_AUTH request. This is a 
          deviation from the rules in RFC 5996, so support needs to be indicated through a Notify 
          payload in the IKE_SA_INIT response. This Notify replaces the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start
          message of ERX, and therefore contains the domain name, as specified in section 5.3.1.1 
          of <xref target="RFC5296bis"/>.</t>
        <t> A supporting initiator that has unexpired keys for this domain will send the 
          EAP_Initiate/Re-auth message in an EAP payload in the first IKE_AUTH request.</t>
        <t> The responder sends the EAP payload content to a backend AAA server, and receives the
          rMSK and an EAP-Finish/Re-auth message. It then forwards the EAP-Finish/Re-auth message 
          to the Initiator in an EAP payload within the first IKE_AUTH response.</t>
        <t> The initiator then sends an additional IKE_AUTH request, that includes the AUTH payload
          which has been calculated using the rMSK in the role of the MSK as described in sections
          2.15 and 2.16 of <xref target="RFC5996"/>. The responder replies similarly, and the 
          IKE_AUTH exchange is finished.</t>
        <t> The following figure is adapted from appendixes C.1 and C.3 of RFC 5996, with most of 
          the optional payloads removed. Note that the EAP_Initiate/Re-auth message is added.</t>

        <section anchor="eap_clarif" title="Clarification About EAP Codes">
          <t> Section 3.16 of RFC 5996 enumerates the EAP codes in EAP messages which are carried 
            in EAP payloads. The enumeration goes only to 4. It is not clear whether that list is 
            supposed to be exhaustive or not.</t>
          <t> To clarify, an implementation supporting this specification MUST accept and transmit
            EAP messages with at least the codes for Initiate and Finish (5 and 6), in addition to
            the four codes enumerated in RFC 5996. This document is intentionally silent about 
            other EAP codes that are not enumerated in RFC 5996 or in this document.</t>
        </section>        
        <section anchor="keyname_nai" title="User Name in the Protocol">
          <t> The authors, as well as participants of the HOKEY and IPsecME working groups believe 
            that all use cases for this extension to IKE have a single backend AAA server doing 
            both the authentication and the re-authentication. The reasoning behind this is that
            IKE runs over the Internet, and would naturally connect to the user's home network.</t>
          <t> This section addresses instances where this is not the case.</t>  
          <t> Section 5.3.2 of <xref target="RFC5296bis" /> describes the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth
            packet, which in the case of IKEv2 is carried in the first IKE_AUTH request. This
            packet contains the KeyName-NAI TLV. This TLV contains the username used in 
            authentication. It is relayed to the AAA server in the AccessRequest message, and is
            returned from the AAA server in the AccessAccept message.</t>
          <t> The username part of the NAI within the TLV is the EMSKName encoded in hexadecimal
            digits. The domain part is the domain name of the home domain of the user. The username
            part is ephemeral in the sense that a new one is generated for each full authentication.
            This ephemeral value is not a good basis for making policy decisions, and they are also
            a poor source of user identification for the purposes of logging.</t>
          <t> Instead, it is up to the implementation in the IPsec gateway to make policy decisions
            based on other factors. The following list is by no means exhaustive: <list style="symbols">
            <t> In some cases the home domain name may be enough to make policy decisions. If all 
              users with a particular home domain get the same authorization, then policy does not
              depend on the real user name. Meaningful logs can still be issued by correlating VPN 
              gateway IKE events with AAA servers access records.</t>
            <t> Sometimes users receive different authorizations based on groups they belong to.
              The AAA server can communicate such information to the VPN gateway, for example using 
              the CLASS attribute in RADIUS and Diameter. Logging again depends on correlation with
              AAA servers.</t>
            <t> AAA servers may support extensions that allow them to communicate with their clients
              (in our case - the VPN gateway) to push user information. For example, a certain
              product integrates a RADIUS server with LDAP, so a client could query the server using
              LDAP and receive the real record for this user. Others may provide this data through
              vendor-specific extensions to RADIUS or DIAMETER.</t></list></t>
          <t> In any case authorization is a major issue in deployments, if the backend AAA server
            supporting the re-authentication is different from the AAA server that had supported
            the original authentication. It is up to the re-authenticating AAA server to provide
            the necessary information for authorization. A conforming implementation of this 
            protocol MAY reject initiators for which it is unable to make policy decisions because 
            of these reasons.</t>

        <t> The protocol extension described in this document extends the authentication from one
          EAP context, which may or may not be part of IKEv2, to an IKEv2 context. Successful
          completion of the protocol proves to the authenticator, which in our case is a VPN
          gateway, that the supplicant, or VPN client, has authenticated in some other EAP context.</t>
        <t> The protocol supplies the authenticator with the domain name with which the supplicant
          has authenticated, but does not supply it with a specific identity. Instead, the gateway
          receives an EMSKName, which is an ephemeral ID.</t>
        <t> If the domain name is sufficient to make access control decisions, this is enough. If
          not, then the gateway needs to find out either the real name or authorization information
          for that particular user. This may be done using the AAA protocol or by some other 
          federation protocol, which is out of scope for this specification.</t>
