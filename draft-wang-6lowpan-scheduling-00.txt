Abstract

   These years, wireless technologies, including the application of
   6LoWPAN protocol, are more and more been applied in industrial
   environment to improve productivity and safety of the plants. In
   spite of the fact that [RFC4944] has introduced the methods of
   transmitting IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks, industrial
   automation field, either process automation or factory automation,
   has its special characteristics and requirements. If 6LoWPAN is been
   used in industrial environment, some change SHOULD be made in the
   adaption layer. This document defines a Scheduling Header, to make
   the adaption layer meet the requirements of industrial scheduling for
   transmission of IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks.
   Additionally, this document also provides an application example of
   Scheduling Header.

1. Introduction

   Wireless technology has been demonstrated as an effective option for
   industrial applications. For convenient and fast deployment in a
   global world, it has attracted huge attention to introduce IPv6
   technology to wireless industrial networks. But in the industrial
   environment, especially the environments (eg. a coal mine) with high

   risk and low bandwidth, the resources are too limited. Which MUST be
   scheduled properly to ensure every significant thing be done in its
   specific time and channel and to ensure the safety and reliability.
   It is worth mentioning that the MAC layers of some industrial
   standards, [ISA100.11a]/[Wireless Hart]/[WIA-PA] standards, schedule
   the slot time and channel resources of network with TDMA and ACA
      Adaptive Channel Allocation  mechanism. Through the investigation
   of the data features and the application class of wireless
   industrial applications, a conclusion can be draw that the important
   requirements for wireless industrial networks are:

   * Determinism

   * Reliability

   * Real time

   * Security

   * Synchronization

   However, the adaption layer of 6LoWPAN defined in RFC 4944 is mainly
   based on contention access and best effort delivery. It does not
   make special optimization for industrial applications. To meet above
   requirements, it is recommended to improve the design of the
   adaption layer for transmission of IPv6 packets.

   ISA100.11a adopts 6LoWPAN as its network layer, but the function of
   6LoWPAN in is limited. For example, the operations of scheduling and
   routing in the wireless subnet are performed by upper data link
   layer of ISA100.11a rather than network layer. Moreover, ISA100.11a
   is an integrated solution for industrial control net, including
   system manager, gateway, provisioning and a series of new protocols
   for every layer except physical layer. 6LoWPAN is just a part of
   ISA100.11a system. For simple or lightweight industrial applications
   which want to use IPv6 technology, the ISA100.11a has too much
   overhead to deploy. Thus, it is attractive to add direct support
   mechanism for industrial applications in 6LoWPAN. Industrial users
   will benefit from more choices for different kinds of applications.

   Consequently, it's hoped that 6LoWPAN supports the schedule
   mechanism, and to be more suitable for industrial application. In
   this case, the MAC layer is based on slot time, while the upper
   layer, called the adaption layer, is based on non-slot. Therefore,
   it is necessary to improve the frame format of the adaptation layer,
   to make it support scheduling operations.

   As a result, this document improves the frame format of the
   adaptation and defines a scheduling header. In addition, this
   document also introduces an application example of the Scheduling
   Header.

1.1. Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]

1.2. Terms Uesd

   MAC:   Medium Access Control

   Industrial Wireless Standard:   At present, there are three main
   industrial wireless standards, ISA100.11a, WirelessHART, and WIA-PA.

   ISA:       ''International Society of Automation''. ISA is an ANSI
   accredited standards-making society. ISA100 is an ISA committee
   whose charter includes defining a family of standards for industrial
   automation. [ISA100.11a] is a working group within ISA100 that is
   working on a standard for monitoring and non-critical process
   control applications.

   HART:      ''Highway Addressable Remote Transducer'', a group of
   specifications for industrial process and control devices
   administered by the HART Foundation. The specifications include the
   additions for Wireless HART.

   WIA-PA:   ''Wireless Networks for Industrial Automation-Process
   Automation'', a Chinese industrial wireless specification, is passed
   by 96% of IEC(International Electrotechnical Commission) members,
   and formally released as IEC/PAS 62601 standard document.

   CSMA/CA:    Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Avoidance

   TDMA:   Time Division Multiple Address

   GTS:   Guaranteed Time Slot

   Safety:   It means the system's safety of industrial environment,
   including the safety of devices and human safety.

   Security:   It means the specific security mechanism or security
   algorithm.

   Scheduling time:   It means the time a node must to wait between the
    time it wanted to send data or received data and the moment it send
    data to a special node. When the MAC layer schedules the slot time
    and channel resources of network with TDMA mechanism, every node get
    send slots and receive slots. In this case if node A wants to send
    data to node B, it have to send data at its send slot, which is also
    the receive slot of node B. The time from the time A wanted to send
    data to the slot above mentioned is the scheduling time from node A
    to node B. It is noteworthy that the scheduling time from A to B is
    usually different from the scheduling time from B to A.

   Determinism:   It is usually meant that access to the control
   network by a node may be delayed by at most some time t, where t is
   known. In industrial wireless network, it also means that data is
   sent and received within the stipulated time.

   Neighbor domain:   It means the neighbors a node could reach to.
   Node could use neighbor discovery to find its neighbors and store
   the neighbors' addresses in its neighbor table.

2. Scheduling Header

   In this section, we define the scheduling dispatch value and the
   field of Scheduling Header, used for supporting scheduling
   operations.

2.1. Scheduling dispatch and IPv6 header stack

   The definition of LoWPAN headers, other than mesh addressing and
   fragmentation, consists of the dispatch value, and the definition of
   the header fields that follow. Note that [RFC 4944] has defined some
   values for some headers. In order to avoid any conflicts with the
   existing standard documents, including [RFC 4944] and [RFC 6282], we
   make full use of the reserved symbols of dispatch. Here, we set the
   value of Scheduling dispatch is 01 000011. The Scheduling dispatch
   and the Scheduling Header are shown here:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

             Figure 1 Scheduling dispatch and Scheduling Header

   The dispatch value may be treated as unstructured namespace. Only a
   few symbols have been used to represent current LoWPAN functionality

   according to [RFC 4944]. We can use the non-defined values to encode
   additional functionality.

   According to RFC 4944, all LoWPAN encapsulated datagrams transported
   over IEEE 802.15.4 are prefixed by an encapsulated header stack.
   Whereas in an IPv6 header stack, the Scheduling dispatch and the
   Scheduling Header follow the Mesh Header and the next are other
   headers, or options, finally payload. An Ipv6 header stack
   containing Scheduling Header is shown as figure 2.

   Here, the other headers contain IPv6 header or other compressed IPv6
   headers, and other types of header.

2.2. Scheduling Header

   The Scheduling Header is shown here:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                        Figure 3 Scheduling Header

   Field definitions are as follows:

   Sequence ID: This 8-bit field is a local counter maintained
   separately by each node and SHALL be incremented by the originator
   whenever it sends a datagram with a Scheduling Header. This field is
   used for follow-up maintenance, for example it could be used to tell
   new datagrams from old datagrams.

   Scheduling ID: This 8-bit field is used for identifying paths or
   other scheduling parameter, which SHALL meet the industrial
   requirements mentioned in the above section of Introduction,
   especially the requirements of determinism. During the transmission
   of the datagram, the Scheduling ID could show the information of
   propagation path.

Internet-Draft    draft-wang-6lowpan-scheduling-00          April 2012


   Scheduling Time Limit: This 16-bit field is used mainly to identify
   the maximum scheduling time a packet allowed to be sent. It is the
   key field to ensure the requirement of determinism, and in units of
   milliseconds. This field can contain values up to 65535.
   Additionally, it is an accumulated metric, an aggregation of
   scheduling time value of every node along the path. Especially, when
   a datagram with the requirement of determinism is sent for the first
   time, this field is necessary for it to choose a satisfying path.

   It is worth noting that the above definition of the Scheduling
   Header is originally envisaged. With the subsequent increase in
   scheduling applications, it MAY be further modified. Meanwhile, the
   definition of the fields SHOULD be applied flexibly, according to
   actual needs.

3. An example using Scheduling Header

   Scheduling Header defined aims to support scheduling operation, and
   to meet the industrial application requirements of determinism.
   According to the initial consideration, the Scheduling Time Limit is
   the key field to ensure determinism, which is used mainly to
   identify the maximum scheduling time a packet allowed along the
   transmission path. It is also to say that a datagram must be
   transmitted from source node to destination node with the given
   Scheduling Time Limit. So, we can see it as an accumulated routing
   metric. Along this train of thought, route discovery MAY be an
   obvious application of Scheduling Header defined above.

   The aim of this section is simply to provide an example of
   Scheduling Header application, using it in route discovery. Needless
   to say that the MAC layer SHOULD based on TDMA and ACA mechanism,
   which schedules the slot time and channel resources of network.

3.1. Route Discovery

   The way of route discovery in this section is an on-demand algorithm,
   that is, it determines a route to some destination only when
   somebody wants to send packet to this destination within a
   Scheduling Time Limit. The Scheduling Time Limit is set by users.
   The route discovery process is similar to AODV (Ad hoc On-demand
   Distance Vector) routing algorithm. However, the broadcast slots in
   the deterministic scheduling mechanism are usually for organizing
   network and time synchronization, using broadcast slots in route
   discovery MAY effect the functional aspects of whole network.
   Meanwhile, the route discovery for datagram is on-demand and
   optional. So, it usually uses the non-broadcast slot for route



Wang, et al.          Expires October 21, 2012                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    draft-wang-6lowpan-scheduling-00          April 2012


   discovery. One of the solutions is that node use a group of unicast
   messages to realize the broadcast effectiveness.

   In order to describe route discovery process in detail, we make
   following assumptions:

   o The MAC layer is based on TDMA, if node A could send packet to
      node B in a slot, then node B could send packet to node A in a
      slot too.

   o Before the route discovery process, the scheduling process is
      over, and every node knows its send slot and scheduling time to a
      special node.

   o The mesh network can be described by a graph of the nodes
      (routers + end devices). Two nodes are connected (i.e., have an
      arc between them in the graph) if they are in each other's
      neighbor domain.

   To describe the algorithm, consider the mesh network of figure 4, in
   which a process on node A wants to send a packet to node H. This
   algorithm maintains some tables at each node, including:

   o Scheduling Path History Table, which is maintained by source node,
      stores information about that destination, including the Path ID,
      the destination address, as well as the Scheduling Time Limit.

   o Neighbor Table, which is got from the neighbor discovery process
      before scheduling process, stores the address information of the
      node's neighbors.

   o Route Table, which is maintained by routers, stores information
      about that destination, including the Path ID, the destination
      address, as well as the next hop address.

   o Local History Table, which is maintained by routers, stores the
      tuple (Source address, Request ID, Destination address) for
      determining duplicate packet.

   o Reverse Route Table, which is maintained by every node, stores
      the reverse route information. This information used to construct
      the reverse route so the reply packet can get back to the source
      later. Meanwhile, a timer is also started for the newly-made
      reverse route entry. If it expires, the entry is deleted.

   According to the user's requirements, A wants to send data with
   Scheduling Header to H. Suppose that A looks in its Scheduling Path


Wang, et al.          Expires October 21, 2012                [Page 8]

   History table and does not find an entry for H to ensure the
   requirements of Scheduling Time Limit. It now has to discover a path
   to H, which could meet the constraints. This property of discovering
   paths only when they are needed is what makes this algorithm ''on
   demand.''

                  Figure 4 The process of path discovery

   In figure 4, every node has a neighbor domain. Node B and node C are
   in A's neighbor domain, then B and C could receive A's message. In
   the graph of (a), B and C have received A's messages. In the graph
   of (b), E, F and G have received A's messages forwarded by B and C.
   And in the graph of (c), node H has received A's messages forward by
   E and F. The nodes in [square brackets] are new recipients.

   To locate H, node A May construct a Scheduling Route Request (SRR)
   message and send it to all of his neighbors to find a satisfying
   path to H. This packet reaches B and C, as illustrated in (a) of
   figure 4. In fact, the reason B and C are connected to A in the
   graph is that they can receive communication from A. G, for example,
   is not shown with an arc to A because it cannot receive A's radio
   signal. Thus, G is not a neighbor to A and also not connected to A.

   The main format of SRR message is shown in figure 5. It contains the
   source and destination address, which identify who is looking for
   whom. It also contains a Request ID, which is a local counter
   maintained separately by each node and incremented each time a group
   of SRR packets is sent to its neighbors. Together, the originator
   address and the Request ID uniquely identify the special group of
   SRR messages to allow nodes to discard any duplicates they may
   receive.

   +--------------+----------+-------------------+---------------+---------+---------------------+

         Figure 5 Main format of a Scheduling Route Request packet

   In addition to the Request ID counter, there is also a second
   sequence counter, Source sequence, which is incremented whenever a
   SRR message is sent (or forward someone else's SRR message). It
   functions a little bit like a clock. The fourth field of figure 5 is
   A's sequence counter.

   The Hop limit of SRR is used for terminating the diffusion of SRR
   messages in the network. It SHALL be decremented by each forwarding
   node before sending this packet towards its next hop. The packet is
   not forwarded any further if Hops Left is decremented to zero.

   The Scheduling time limit of SRR message is an accumulated limit of
   path. Every time node sends a packet to its neighbor, the Scheduling
   time limit will minus the scheduling time value of the send node to
   its special neighbor, whatever the originator or the forwarding
   nodes. When it is decremented to zero, the node will discard the
   packet, and stop to send it to his neighbor. The original value of
   Scheduling time limit in SRR is the same to the Scheduling Time
   Limit in Scheduling Header. The use of these fields will become
   clear shortly.

   Before sending it to his neighbors, Node A will firstly compute the
   scheduling time to every neighbor node according to scheduling
   mechanism, and then compute the Scheduling Time Limit to every
   neighbor (the old Scheduling time limit minus scheduling time to the
   neighbor). If the new Scheduling time limit to a neighbor becomes to
   0 or negative, A will not send the SRR to the neighbor.

   When a SRR arrives at a node (B and C in this case), it is processed
   in the following steps.

   o Step 1: The tuple of (Source address, Request ID, Destination
      address) is looked up in a local history table to see if this
      request has already been seen and processed. If is a duplicate,
      it is discarded and processing stops. If it is not a duplicate,
      the tuple is entered into the history table so future duplicates
      can be rejected, and processing continues.

   o Step2: The receiver looks up its Neighbor Table, compute the
      scheduling time to every neighbor node according to scheduling
      mechanism, and then compute the Scheduling Time Limit to every

      neighbor. If the new Scheduling time limit to a neighbor becomes
      to 0 or negative, A will not send the SRR to the neighbor.
      Instead, it will decrease the Hop left, increase the Source
      sequence and renew the Scheduling time limit, and then resend the
      SRR message to its neighbor. It is worth noting that if the Hop
      left field becomes to 0, the sending process is terminated too.

   o Step3: The receiver also extracts the data from the packet and
      stories it as a new entry in its Reverse Route Table. This
      information will be used to construct the reverse route so that
      the acknowledgement packet can get back to the source later. And
      a timer is also started for the newly-made reverse route entry.
      If it expires, the entry is deleted.

   Neither B nor C knows where H is, so each of them creates a reverse
   route entry pointing back to A, and resend the SRR with a new Hop
   Left, a new Source sequence, and a new Scheduling Time Limit. The
   SRR from B reaches E and C. E makes an entry for it in its reverse
   route table and resend it. In contrast, C rejects it as a duplicate.
   Similarly, C's SRR is rejected by B. The process goes on, until H
   receives the broadcast, and the special datagram reaches a
   destination that knows where H is, namely H, as illustrated in (c)
   graph of Figure 4. Note that although we have shown the sending
   process in three discrete steps here, the SRR forwarded from
   different nodes are not coordinated in any way.

   In response to the incoming SRR message, H SHOULD builds an
   acknowledgement packet, here called Scheduling Route Acknowledgement
   (SRA) message. The main format of SRA message is shown in figure 6.

   +--------------+----------+-------------------+-------+---------+
   |Source address|Request ID|Destination address|Path ID|Hop count|
   +--------------+----------+-------------------+-------+---------+

     Figure 6 Main format of a Scheduling Route Acknowledgement packet

   The Source address, Destination address, and Request ID are copied
   from the incoming request message, but the Hop count field is
   initialized to 0. The Path ID is a counter maintained by the
   destination node. Each time, the destination node receives a SRR
   message sent or forwarded by different node, it will increase the
   Path ID, which means there is a new path. This message is unicast to
   the node that the SRR message came from, in this case, E and F. It
   then follows the reverse path to B or C, and finally to A. At each
   node, Hop count is incremented so the node can see how far from the
   destination (H) it is.

   At each intermediate node on the way back, the message is inspected.
   It is entered into the Route Table as a path to H.

   In this way, all the nodes on the reverse route learn the path with
   Path ID to H. And the original node (A) set the Path ID of SRA into
   the Scheduling ID of the Scheduling header. When data with
   Scheduling Header is sending, the intermediate nodes will know which
   path to forward the data.

   This document only shows the main fields of the SRR and SRA messages,
   in fact, the SRR and SRA could be extended from the RPL messages or
   other exiting protocols. The specific extension methods are out of
   this document.

3.2. Route Maintenance

   Because nodes can move or be switched off, the topology can change
   spontaneously. When the topology has changed, the algorithm needs to
   be able to deal with the failure.

4. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new Scheduling Header for 6LoWPAN to support
   scheduling mechanism and to meet the industrial requirement of
   determinism.

   [RFC 4944] has allocated some values of dispatch for some headers.
   This assignment preempts the assignment of 01 111111 for ESC [RFC
   4944]; this preemption is possible because extension bytes that
   would enable the use of ESC have not been allocated yet. But [RFC
   6282] takes 01 000000 as a replacement value for ESC, and allocates
   the value between 01 100000 to 01 111111 for LoWPAN_IPHC. Meanwhile,
   it also creates a new IANA registry for LoWPAN_NHC, and has used the
   value from 1110000 to 1110111.

   As a result, the document allocates 01 000011 of the dispatch for
   Scheduling dispatch.

5. Security Considerations

   In industrial environment, the wireless networks share the same
   place and time. In this case, if the security mechanism is not very
   brilliant, it will seriously affect the system's information
   security. The security mechanism is beyond the scope of this draft.

6. Conclusions

   This document describes the method of transmission scheduling
   information over 6LoWPAN Adaption layer for industrial application.
   6LoWPAN nodes use the Scheduling Header to determine the packets
   scheduling information, including the transmission path and
   constraints, to meet the requirement of determinism.
