Abstract

   The United States Government has published guidelines for "NSA Suite
   B Cryptography" dated July, 2005, which defines cryptographic
   algorithm policy for national security applications.  This document
   specifies the conventions for using Suite B algorithms in the
   Kerberos 5 protocol specification.

   Since many of the Suite B algorithms enjoy uses in other environments
   as well, the majority of the conventions needed for the Suite B
   algorithms are already specified in other documents.  This document
   references the source of these conventions, with some relevant
   details repeated to aid developers that choose to support Suite B.

Internet-Draft       Suite B Profile for Kerberos 5     October 19, 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the use of the United States National
   Security Agency's Suite B algorithms [NSA] in Kerberos 5.  Symmetric
   key encryption algorithms and checksum types are specified for use in
   the protocol.  Additionally, the use of elliptic curve cryptography
   in the initial authentication protocol (PKINIT) is specified.

2.  Conventions used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Suite B Requirements

   Suite B requires that key establishment and signature algorithms be
   based upon Elliptic Curve Cryptography and that the encryption
   algorithm be AES [FIPS197].

   Suite B includes [NSA]:

      Encryption:         Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [FIPS197]
                          (key sizes of 128 and 256 bits)

      Digital Signature:  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
                          (ECDSA) [FIPS186-3] (using the curves with
                          256- and 384-bit prime moduli)

      Key Exchange:       Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
                          [SP800-56A] (using the curves with 256- and
                          384-bit prime moduli)

      Hashes:             SHA-256 and SHA-384 [FIPS180-3]

   The two elliptic curves used in Suite B each appear in the literature
   under two different names.  For sake of clarity, we list both names
   below:

      Curve       NIST Name    SECG Name    OID  [FIPS186-3]
      --------------------------------------------------------- 
      nistp256    P-256        secp256r1    1.2.840.10045.3.1.7 
      nistp384    P-384        secp384r1    1.3.132.0.34

4.  Minimum Levels of Security (minLOS)

   Suite B provides for two levels of cryptographic security, namely a
   128-bit minimum level of security (minLOS_128) and a 192-bit minimum

   level of security (minLOS_192).  Each level defines a minimum
   strength that all cryptographic algorithms must provide.

4.1.  Non-signature Primitives

   We divide the Suite B non-signature primitives into two columns as
   shown in Table 1.

                            Column 1            Column 2
                       +-------------------+------------------+
      Encryption       |    AES-128        |    AES-256       |
                       +-------------------+------------------+
      Key Agreement    |    ECDH on P-256  |    ECDH on P-384 |
                       +-------------------+------------------+
      Hash for PRF/MAC |    SHA-256        |    SHA-384       |
                       +-------------------+------------------+
       Table 1: Suite B Cryptographic Non-Signature Primitives

   At the 128-bit minimum level of security:

      - the non-signature primitives MUST either come exclusively from
        Column 1 or exclusively from Column 2.


   At the 192-bit minimum level of security:

      - the non-signature primitives MUST come exclusively from
        Column 2.

4.2.  Suite B Authentication

   Digital signatures using ECDSA MUST be used for authentication by
   Suite B compliant Kerberos implementations.  To simplify notation,
   ECDSA-256 will be used to represent an instantiation of the ECDSA
   algorithm using the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash function, and
   ECDSA-384 will be used to represent an instantiation of the ECDSA
   algorithm using the P-384 curve and the SHA-384 hash function.

   If configured at a minimum level of security of 128 bits, a Suite B
   Kerberos implementation MUST use either ECDSA-256 or ECDSA-384 for
   authentication.  It is allowable for one party to authenticate with
   ECDSA-256 and the other party to authenticate with ECDSA-384.  This
   flexibility will allow interoperability between a client and a server
   that have different sizes of ECDSA authentication keys.

   Clients and servers in a Suite B Kerberos implementation configured
   at a minimum level of security of 128 bits MUST be able to verify
   ECDSA-256 signatures and SHOULD be able to verify ECDSA-384

   signatures unless it is absolutely certain that the implementation
   will never need to verify certificates from an authority which uses
   an ECDSA-384 signing key.

   If configured at a minimum level of security of 192 bits, ECDSA-384
   MUST be used by both parties for authentication.

   Clients and servers in a Suite B Kerberos implementation configured
   at a minimum level of security of 192 bits MUST be able to verify
   ECDSA-384 signatures.

4.3.  Digital Signatures and Certificates

   The client and server in a Suite B compliant Kerberos implementation,
   at both minimum levels of security, MUST each use an X.509
   certificate that complies with the "Suite B Certificate and
   Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC5759] and that
   contains an elliptic curve public key with the key usage field set
   for digital signature.  


5.  PKINIT

   This section specifies the use of Suite B algorithms for integrating
   public key cryptography into the initial authentication protocol
   (PKINIT).  The use of public key certificates and signature schemes
   allows the client and KDC to mutually authenticate in the
   Authentication Service (AS) request and reply. Furthermore, PKINIT
   eliminates the dependency of the AS reply key on a password,
   enhancing the security of the Kerberos protocol.

   The original protocol extensions which include public key
   cryptography are described in PKINIT [RFC4556] and specifications for
   using elliptic curve cryptography are presented in ECC for PKINIT
   [RFC5349].  The majority of the conventions needed for Suite B are in
   those two documents and only the necessary details are provided here.

   In Suite B, public key cryptography (PKINIT) MUST be used in the
   initial authentication protocol to avoid the need for password-based
   authentication.  As defined in [RFC4556], one of the following pre-
   authentication data elements MUST be included in the AS_REQ and
   AS_REP messages.

Internet-Draft       Suite B Profile for Kerberos 5     October 19, 2012


   The specific requirements for using ECDH and ECDSA in PKINIT are
   presented in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 respectively.

5.1.  Algorithm Agility

   PKINIT [RFC4556] has several dependencies on SHA-1 as a checksum
   algorithm.  The first occurrence is the paChecksum field of the
   PKAuthenticator structure in the authentication request which is
   defined to contain the SHA-1 checksum of the KDC-REQ-BODY.  PKINIT
   also requires SHA-1 in the key derivation function used to derive the
   AS reply key from the shared secret value generated by the
   Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  Since Suite B requires SHA-256 or
   SHA-384 for hashing, the client and KDC need a method to negotiate
   the hash algorithm used in PKINIT.

   [alg-agility] updates PKINIT by allowing the client and KDC to
   negotiate a KDF from [SP800-56A] which will provide integrity of the
   request body as well as a cryptographic binding between the client's
   pre-authentication data and the corresponding request body.  This is
   achieved as described in Section 6 of [alg-agility] by including the
   AS-REQ and PA-PK-AS-REP messages and the ticket from the KDC in the
   OtherInfo input parameter to the KDF.

   Choosing a KDF from [SP800-56A] that uses SHA-256 or SHA-384 as the
   hash function therefore eliminates the need for the paChecksum field.
   In Suite B, the client MUST NOT include the SHA-1 checksum of the
   KDC-REQ-BODY in the paChecksum field of the cryptographic binding and
   integrity protection.  The KDC MUST NOT return a KRB-ERROR message
   due to the absence of the paChecksum field when validating the
   client's request since the paChecksum field is optional syntactically
   in [RFC4556].  Section 6 of [alg-agility] describes the new
   structures and fields included in the AS request and reply messages.

   In Suite B, one of the following KDFs defined in [alg-agility] MUST
   be used to derive the AS reply key from the Diffie-Hellman shared
   secret.

      Key Derivation Function      OID  [alg-agility]

      id-pkinit-kdf-ah-sha384      1.3.6.1.5.2.3.6.4

5.2.  ECDH Key Exchange

   The use of elliptic curve cryptography in PKINIT is described in
   [RFC5349].  This section describes the Suite B requirements for using
   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) to generate the AS reply key.

Internet-Draft       Suite B Profile for Kerberos 5     October 19, 2012


   In Suite B, ephemeral-ephemeral ECDH MUST be used as the AS reply key
   agreement method.  In a Suite B Kerberos system configured at a
   minimum level of security of 128 bits, ephemeral-ephemeral ECDH MUST
   be used with the SHA-256 KDF and the P-256 elliptic curve or used
   with the SHA-384 KDF and the P-384 elliptic curve.  In a Suite B
   Kerberos system configured at a minimum level of security of 192
   bits, ephemeral-ephemeral ECDH MUST be used with the SHA-384 KDF and
   the P-384 elliptic curve.  A detailed description of the uses of the
   ECDH key exchange in PKINIT is provided in [RFC5349].

   The client MUST include its encoded ECDH ephemeral public key value
   and domain parameters in the clientPublicValue field of the AuthPack
   structure as described in [RFC4556].  The clientPublicValue field
   MUST comply with the SubjectPublicKeyInfo guidance in [RFC5759]
   Section 4.4.  

   The KDC MUST include its encoded ECDH ephemeral public key value in
   the subjectPublicKey field of the KDCDHKeyInfo structure in the
   authentication reply.  Section 2.2 of [RFC5480] provides guidance on
   the format of the subjectPublicKey field.  The KDC MUST NOT reuse its
   DH keys, even if the client includes the clientDHNonce field. Section
   5.6.4.3 of [SP800-56A] states that an ephemeral private key MUST be
   used in exactly one key establishment transaction, SHOULD be
   generated as close to its time of use as possible and MUST be
   zeroized after its use.  Section 5.8 of [SP800-56A] states that the
   Diffie-Hellman shared secret MUST be zeroized immediately after its
   use.  Suite B Kerberos implementations MUST follow the mandates in
   SP800-56A.

   The ECDH shared secret value (Z) is calculated using the ECSVDP-DH
   primitive described in Section 7.2.1 of [IEEE1363].  Note this
   primitive is also described in Section 5.7.1.2 of [SP800-56A] under
   the name ECC CDH.

   The AS reply key is derived from the ECDH shared secret value using a
   negotiated key derivation function from [SP800-56A] with the method
   described in Section 6 of [alg-agility].  The KDF based on SHA-256
   MUST be used when ECDH is used with the 256-bit prime modulus
   elliptic curve and the KDF based on SHA-384 MUST be used when ECDH is
   used with the 384-bit prime modulus elliptic curve.  Additional
   guidance on implementing the Ephemeral Unified Model Key Agreement
   Scheme for Suite B is provided in [IG].

5.3.  ECDSA Digital Signatures

   The use of elliptic curve signature schemes in PKINIT is described in
   [RFC5349].  This section describes the use of digital signatures that
   are compatible with Suite B.

Internet-Draft       Suite B Profile for Kerberos 5     October 19, 2012


   The signatureAlgorithm field of the SignerInfo data type in both the
   AS request and reply messages MUST contain one of the following
   signature algorithm identifiers:

      Signature Algorithm          OID [FIPS186-3] 
      ------------------------------------------------ 
      ecdsa-with-Sha256            1.2.840.10045.4.3.2 
      ecdsa-with-Sha384            1.2.840.10045.4.3.3

   If configured at a minimum level of security of 128 bits, a Suite B
   Kerberos client MUST list one or both of ecdsa-with-sha256 and
   ecdsa-with-sha384 in the supportedCMSTypes field of the
   authentication request as the only acceptable signature algorithms
   for the server's response.  If configured at a minimum level of
   security of 192 bits, a Suite B Kerberos client MUST list
   authentication request as the only acceptable signature algorithm for
   the server's response.

   The corresponding digestAlgorithm field of the SignerInfo data type
   MUST contain one of the following hash algorithm identifiers.

      Hash Algorithm               OID [FIPS180-3]
      ---------------------------------------------------
      id-sha256                    2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.2
      id-sha384                    2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.3

   id-sha256 MUST be used with ecdsa-with-Sha256 and id-sha384 MUST be
   used with ecdsa-with-Sha384, as noted in [RFC5349].

6.  Encryption and Checksum Types

   Encryption and checksum types for Kerberos 5 are described in
   [RFC3961] and specifications for using AES in Kerberos 5 are detailed
   in [RFC3962].  The dependencies of those types on SHA-1 make them
   inappropriate choices for Suite B.  [AES-CBC-SHA2] defines the
   encryption and checksum types required by Suite B.

6.1.  Suite B Requirements

   If configured at a minimum level of security of 128 bits, a Suite B
   Kerberos implementation MUST use either the combination of
   aes128-cts-hmac-sha256-128 for content encryption and
   hmac-sha256-128-aes-128 for message integrity or the combination of
   aes256-cts-hmac-sha384-192 for content encryption and
   hmac-sha384-192-aes256 for message integrity.

   If configured at a minimum level of security of 192 bits, a Suite B
   Kerberos implementation MUST use aes256-cts-hmac-sha384-192 for

   content encryption and hmac-sha384-192-aes256 for message integrity.

   If the Suite B Kerberos client is using ECDH P-256 for its ephemeral
   public key in its request, it MUST list aes128-cts-hmac-sha256-128 in
   the etype field of the req-body in the initial request message.  If
   the Suite B Kerberos client is using ECDH P-384 for its ephemeral
   public key in its request, it MUST list aes256-cts-hmac-sha384-192 in
   the etype field of the req-body in the initial request message.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC4556] discuss PKINIT in general
   and the security considerations in [RFC5349] discuss the use of
   elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).

8.  IANA Considerations

   None.
