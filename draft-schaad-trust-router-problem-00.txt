1.  Introduction

   The following document is a product of my diseased mind as opposed to
   the deceased minds of the Janet Group or Painless Security.
   Specifically, this document uses terms that are defined in
   [I-D.howlett-abfab-trust-router-ps] and in
   [I-D.mrw-abfab-trust-router] but in completely different ways.  One
   therefor needs to be clear about which document one is looking at
   when referring to these documents as oppose to this one.

   This document is heavily influenced by alcohol.  Any one wishing to
   fund future trips by the author to Porto, Portugal is requested to
   communicate immediately.

Internet-Draft            Trust Router Problem                  May 2013


   This document is an expansion of an email message that was origanally
   sent to Alan DeKork and was probably passed on to others.  Given that
   the updates to the problem statement document
   [I-D.howlett-abfab-trust-router-ps] have not been forth comming and
   that the BOF needs some documents in order to progress this draft has
   been produced.

1.1.  Real Introduction

   The ABFAB architecture as outlined by [I-D.ietf-abfab-arch] is, for
   some, missing a key component.  This key component is how the trust
   is conveyed between the service provider, the server recipient and
   the identity provider in an efficient manner.

2.  Justification

   The first thing that must be understood in respect to this issue is
   that for many of the ABFAB architecture proponents, is it an article
   of faith that the PKIX architecture [RFC5280] is broken and cannot be
   trusted.  There are many components that go into this statement,
   however it is as much a statement of religion as it is of reality for
   the proponents of the ABFAB architecture.  That being said, there are
   a number of reasons why this position can be taken.

   o  Correct and usable name formats are very difficult to get correct.
      This is especially true when proxying needs to be done for.  As an
      example see [I-D.ietf-radext-dynamic-discovery] for why this is
      the case.

   o  Revocation processing and checking of PKIX systems is frequently
      missing.

   o  Trust Anchors are a problem when looking in these scenarios.  One
      cannot generally have a single trust anchor due to political a
      trust problems, however having a multiplicity of trust points can
      yield problems when trying to decide who and why trust can be
      placed.  Either one is dependent on a general purpose trust system
      (i.e., the current set of commercial Certificate Authorities) or
      one needs to setup a special purpose CA for the requirements of
      the current infrastructure.

   o  Attribute certificates [RFC5755] have never been readily adopted
      as a way to convey attributes.

Internet-Draft            Trust Router Problem                  May 2013


   Next, it needs to be understood that the current set of AAA routing
   infrastructure is deficient to meet the needs of a truly secure
   system.  Many of these short comings can be seen by the attempt of
   [I-D.ietf-radext-dynamic-discovery] to close some of these issues,
   but not very successfully.

   The following represents a set of reasons why the current RADIUS
   security is not adequate.

   o  Link level security is the current state of the art for RADIUS
      servers, however it is frequently missing on individual links and
      it is not possible for either end point to verify that link level
      security is provided over the entirety of the system.

   o  Link level security is currently configured on each hop in the
      link.  It would be preferable that the security could be
      "centrally" configured.

   o  Different message need to be routed differently based on the level
      of security needed for the message.  This is currently addressed
      by either having all of the links configured to be at the highest
      level of security or for there to be multiple links between
      different entities based on the different levels.  Since the
      configuration is done on each pair of RADIUS entities, there is no
      easy way for a third party auditing service to either add or
      remove entities from the backbone based on an evaluation of their
      security practices.

   o  RADIUS security is monolithic in concept, this means that one
      cannot readily have multiple different communities with different
      needs use a single RADIUS network.  The network would need to be
      configured at the highest needs, but that may not be is not
      necessary for all of the communities.

3.  Routing Problems

   There are a number of routing specific issues that need to be
   addressed with this solution as well.

   o  There is expected to be a large amount of data that is passed
      between the EAP server and the EAP client as part of the
      validation process.  This is a logical consequence of the fact
      that we will be using TEAP [I-D.ietf-emu-eap-tunnel-method] which
      is based on TLS and thus can contain large certificates, CRLS and
      other cryptographic information.  Hosting this on top of UDP is
      not going to be successful in the long run, the amount of
      fragmenting both at the UDP level and at the RADIUS and EAP levels
      will lead to poor performance in many cases.  The use of TCP/IP

      [RFC6613][RFC6614], with it's session state and recovery will help
      this problem.

   o  Routing needs to be static rather than dynamic from end-to-end.
      Given that the routing is based on the conditions required for the
      set of messages under consideration, the policy enforcement needs
      to be consistent, allowing for routing of each packet in the
      stream independently means that enforcement of constraints cannot
      be consistently enforce.

   o  Adding and removing destinations from the routing tables is hard
      as it must be done for every entity on the backbone.

   o  There is currently no way to apply policy to the routing of items
      based on such things as the LOA desired by the message.

4.  Trust Router Objectives

   There are three main objectives for this work:

   1.  Publish the location of AAA servers in a secure manner to all AAA
       clients within a trusted network.

   2.  Create a mechanism to allow for creation of sub-communities
       within a AAA system.

   3.  Create a temporary "short-lived" direct link with a DH or ECDH
       key pair for validation between an AAA client/proxy (near the
       service) and the AAA server for the user (near the IDP).  The
       link created will carry policy information for governing the
       release of information from the IDP to the AAA client.

5.  Entities in the system

   This section documents a number of basic entities that are
   participating in the trust router system.  Some of these entities are
   included for completeness as they are part of the ABFAB architecture,
   but are not direct participants in the Trust Router architecture.

5.1.  End User

   The end user is the entity that is requesting a service from the
   service provider.








Schaad                 Expires November 25, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            Trust Router Problem                  May 2013


   The end user has no pre-existing relationship with the service
   provider.  The end user does have a pre-existing relationship with an
   IDP.  The relationship with the IDP will include the ability for a
   set of cryptographic credentials to be used to validate the user to
   the IDP.  This validation is done using one or more EAP methods.

5.2.  Service Provider

   The Service Provider is used by the end user to get some service.
   The Service Provider has a pre-exsting relationship with a local AAA
   proxy.  The Service Provider itself will be a AAA client.

   There is an issue with the current AAA system that needs to be
   examined, the ABFAB architecture requires that the AAA proxy that the
   SP connects to validate information about the SP.  With a large
   number of SPs being added to and removed from the AAA network, we
   need to look for a way of using the AAA architecture itself to do the
   validation of the SP rather than using the configuration of public
   keys in the AAA proxy.  This can be done with a X.509 certificate
   architecture, however this would not match the overall principle of
   not using X.509 certificates.  The use of EAP and a AAA server to do
   the authentication and attribute checking would make the
   administration of SPs and End Users similar which would reduce
   administrative problems.

5.3.  Community of Registration (COR)

   At its most basic level, a Community of Registration (COR) consists
   of a set of entities and an IDP that can authenticate those entities.
   A COR operator has a specific set of requirements about how entities
   are to be initially identified, how they are to be authenticated each
   time they appear and what information is to released to third parties
   upon request.  A COR operator may have a multiplicity of such
   requirements based on internal policies and requests from service
   providers.  A Level Of Assurance (LOA) is one of the pieces of
   information that a COR would have in this set of requirements.

5.3.1.  Atomic CORs

   An Atomic COR consists of a single database of registration.  It may
   consist of one or more on-line presences, but each on-line presence
   is required to produce exactly the same results.

Internet-Draft            Trust Router Problem                  May 2013


5.3.2.  Mesh CORs

   The following is a potential feature and may not make it into the
   final output.

   It makes sense to allow for CORs to be aggregated together into a
   single unit, thus for example the University of Washington could run
   a mesh COR that comprises of the CORs for the undergraduate school,
   the law school, the medical school, etc..

   There is a known privacy issue with allowing the existence of mesh
   CORs, multiple correlated queries can be constructed that can leak
   information about which COR an entity is associated, even if that
   information is not directly provided to the SP.

5.3.3.  Release of Information

   The main function of a COR in the ABFAB architecture is to release
   information about the end user to the service provider.  The smallest
   amount of information that can be provided is to say that the COR
   does or does not recognized the end user.  At the larger end of
   infomration provided, the COR can responde to an SP request with a
   large number of attributes about the end user as part of a SAML
   statement.

   The decision of releasing attributes about the end user is an
   important issue, the least possible amount of information should
   generally be released.  If the user can participate in the decision
   to release information then that should be encouraged, such
   participation is not always possible.  The release of information
   should always be in accordance with the policy of the IDP and, in
   many cases, should be an auditible function.

   There is a need to look at how policies are to be provided for both
   external review and auditing.  It is not clear that this is a strong
   requirement ala the CPS framework that PKIX created [RFC3647].
   However, the more standardized and machine readable this information
   is, the simpler it would be for tools to be able to process and look
   at this information.  This may be an issue when starting to look at
   how things such as attributes are mapped when crossing trust
   boundaries.

5.4.  Communities of Interest (COI)

   One of the goals of this work is to allow for the formation of closed
   subsets of users and services within the overall trust architecture
   that is created.  These closed subsets are called Communities of
   Interest.

Internet-Draft            Trust Router Problem                  May 2013


   A COI is defined by the following properties:

      The name of the COI.  COIs are expected to be uniquely named
      within some domain.  The domain that is used and how that is
      expressed needs to be determined.

      Version control on the COI.  This may be some type of
      monotonically increasing value or a time of last update indicator.
      If there are multiple possible configuration locations in the
      system then a time value may be better as collisions on a counter
      could collide.  In any event there may be a requirement for
      detection of update collisions.

      The set of users that can participate in the COI.  The set of
      users are defined by the use of one or more attribute.  These
      attributes can include the name of the user (expressed as an NAI),
      the COR for a group of users (i.e.  everyone at the University of
      Washington) roles, departments and so forth.  The method of
      expressing the attributes needs to be defined, however one of the
      issues that needs to be dealt with is that fact that the
      attributes are frequently dependent on the COR that issues them.
      This means that attributes will either need to be defined by the
      COI, the trust backbone, a global attribute definier or have the
      ability to some type of mapping of attribute names.

      The set of security properties that are required for users.  Even
      when a user might be able to participate in a COI, the location of
      the user and the methods of authentication used by the user may
      rule out participating in the COI at a given moment.  The security
      proprities represent a set of dynamic properpties based on how the
      user is attached to the network rather than relatively static
      properties that the COR will maintain over time.  The security
      properites may also represent tasks that the COR is requried to
      perform during the authentication.  An example would be that a COI
      requires a specific LOA to be used in authenticating the user.
      This is a property of the COI and not a property of the user.

      The set of service providers that are permitted to use the COI.
      SPs may be specified by name or other attributes in a similar
      manner to that done for users.

      The set of security properties that are required for SPs.  This is
      similar to the set of security proprieties that are required for
      users.

      The set of security properties that are required for the Trusted
      Introducers.  This is similar to the set of security properties
      that are required for users.

   COIs are managed in a central location rather than being distributed
   through the system.  It is presumed that the management of COIs is
   connected to the management of Trust Introducers, but that is an
   issue that will need to be resolved by the protocol.

   It can be seen that ability to make COIs be hierarchical would be a
   convenient practice.  As an example, a COI could be maintained for
   every physical location of the University of Washington.  It would
   then be able to group those COIs in a hierarchical manner grouping by
   larger and larger locations until the entire school is covered.  This
   means that if a new user or service provider were added to one of the
   leafs in the tree then it automatically propagates into all of the
   nodes above it in the tree without additional administrative work.

5.4.1.  Security Issues

   There are a number of security issues that will need to be addressed:

      Should a COI be able to coop a COR without the consent of the COR.

      Depending on how COIs are defined, they can be turned into oracles
      about the members of CORs.

      If an SP can use multiple COIs, then it needs a way to select
      which COI to use for any single transaction.  The choice of the
      COI then needs to be provided to the Trust Backbone.

      There are no provisions for the existence of a COI to be published
      to either SPs or users.  Does there need to be a method for doing
      so?

      When COIs are propagated around the trust backbone, does the data
      about them need to be kept confidential.  While the existence of a
      COI is probably not a big security risk, knowledge of the security
      parameters and entity attributes about the users of the COI may
      constitute a security risk.

5.5.  Trust Backbone

   The trust backbone is a generic term that is being used to designate
   the network of systems which are responsible for connecting the
   different CORs together.  A trust backbone can come in two flavors:
   Intra backbones are maintained by a single entity and operate at a
   single level of security.  Inter backbones consist of multiple intra
   backbones with special systems that operate on the boundaries between
   the different intra backbone to mediate the differences in security
   practices.

Internet-Draft            Trust Router Problem                  May 2013


   Information flows both within a single backbone and between different
   backbones.  Within a single backbone, all information flows
   unmodified.  However when information crosses between backbones it is
   frequently modified to deal with differences in policies or simply
   prevented from passing across the boundary.

   A trust backbone will normally have multiple CORs in it.  A trust
   backbone is the location where COIs are introduced into the system.

5.6.  Trusted Introducers

   The concept of a trusted introducer has been around for a long time.
   This is the basic method by which webs of trust are created.  The
   basic model that is to be used will be based on a web of trust and
   trusted introducers.

   The trusted introducer subsystem is the method where a direct link is
   going to be established between the AAA proxy near the SP and the AAA
   server for the end user.

5.6.1.  Trusted Introducer Initiator

   The Trusted Introducer Initiator (TII) is expected to be integrated
   into the AAA proxy that is adjacent to the SP.  The TII is the
   location where the introduction protocol is kicked off.  The TII is
   required to do the necessary enforcement of the SP identity and
   attributes with the security properties of the backbone and the COI
   selected by the SP.

5.6.2.  Trusted Introducer Router

   The Trusted Introducer Router (TIR) is the basic routing element of
   the trusted introducer network.  TIRs come in two flavors, internal
   and boundary TIRs.  The internal TIR is a simple thing that just does
   routing and the necessary security enforcements.  A boundary TIR on
   the other hand is responsible to dealing with all of the security
   problems that are needed with crossing a security boundary.

5.6.3.  Trusted Introducer Target

   A Trusted Introducer Target (TIT) is expected to be integrated into
   the AAA server.  The TIT is the target of the trusted initiator
   protocol.  The TIT is required to do the necessary enforcement of
   security parameters that are imposed by the AAA server and then
   return the necessary information for the AAA proxy associated with
   the TII to setup a direct TLS link between it and the AAA server.

Internet-Draft            Trust Router Problem                  May 2013


   Once a TLS link between the AAA server and the AAA proxy has been
   established, it may be used for more than one AAA protocol exchange.
   This means that it is a requirement that the AAA server apply all of
   the security information setup on the TLS link be enforced on each
   AAA protocol exchange.

6.  Communication Flows

   There are going to be three different sets of information that will
   need to flow through the system.  We examine each of those flows and
   the properties that are needed.

6.1.  COI Distribution

   The system will need to distribute information about all COIs from
   the centralized configuration points to all of the AAA entities in
   the system.

6.2.  COR Connectivity

   The system will need to distribute the information necessary to build
   a path from any specific Trust Introducer to any given COR.  In point
   of fact, there may be CORs in the system that will not be reachable
   from a specific Trust Introducer due to security constraints on the
   distribution of COR connectivity.

   One of the interesting questions that will need to be explored is:
   Can the COR and COI information be distributed independently and
   combined on the AAA systems or does it need to be combined by the
   Trust Brokers that are doing the distribution of this information.

6.3.  AAA Entity Introduction

   This flow of communication represents the final goal of the protocol.
   We want to be able to build up a TLS connection between the AAA proxy
   that resides nearest to the SP and the AAA server that is going to be
   used to validate the user.

   In building the connection between the proxy and the server the
   following will need to be taken into account:

   o  The identity of the service provider.

   o  The security properties of the connection between the service
      provider and the AAA proxy.

   o  The COI that will govern the connection.

   o  The possible routes between the AAA proxy and the AAA server and
      their security properties.

   Note that no information about the user except the target COR is used
   in the path construction as no such information is both available and
   reliable.  Until the authentication between the user and the COR has
   completed the network will have no idea about the user except for the
   claimed COR.

7.  Putting it all together

   In this section there are a number of pictures of different
   configurations that are germane to the problem

7.1.  Scenario - One Trust Backbone

   In this scenario, we are looking at what is the basic roll out that
   will be done.  In this scenario there are four different security
   zones:

   o  The trust backbone,

   o  The COR for organization A,

   o  The COR for organization B,

   o  The external world

                    Multiple CORs - One Trust Backbone

   There may be a need to create a different scenario for discussion
   about what happens if there is a single COR.  Specifically, on needs
   to look at the question: Does one still need to go through a AAA
   proxy and the trusted introducer protocol or can the SP go directly
   to the AAA Server?  If one goes directly, then there are some
   security gateways that might not get checked.

7.2.  Scenario - Three Trust Backbones

   In this scenario, we are looking at a more complex roll out.  In this
   scenario there are five different security zones:

   o  The trust backbone for A,

   o  The trust backbone for B,

   o  The trust backbone for C,

   o  The COR D,

   o  The COR E.

   In the picture, there is a distinction between the internal and the
   edge trust routers.  In an actual roll out there may not be distinct
