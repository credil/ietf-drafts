Internet-Draft                   swmMIB                    February 2013


1.  Introduction

   Softwire mesh framework RFC 5565 [RFC5565] is a tunneling mechanism
   which enables connectivity between islands of IPv4 networks across
   single IPv6 backbone and vice versa.  In softwire mesh, extended
   multiprotocol-BGP (MP-BGP)is used to set up tunnels and advertise
   prefixes among address family border routers (AFBRs).

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular it defines objects for managing softwire mesh
   [RFC5565].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  They
   are defined using the mechanisms stated in the Structure of
   Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB module that
   is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
   [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from softwire problem statement RFC
   4925 [RFC4925] and softwire mesh framework RFC5565 [RFC5565].

4.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The softwire mesh MIB provides a method to configure and manage the
   softwire mesh objects through SNMP.

5.1.  The swmSupportedTunnlTable Subtree

   Since AFBR need to negotiate with BGP peer what kind of tunnel they
   will use, it should firstly announce the types of tunnels it
   supports.  The swmSupportedTunnlTable subtree provides the

   information.  According to section 4 of RFC 5512[RFC5512], current
   softwire mesh tunnel types include IP-IP, GRE and L2TPv3.

5.2.  The swmEncapsTable Subtree

   The swmEncapsTable subtree provides softwire mesh NLRI-NH information
   about the AFBR.  It keeps the mapping between E-IP prefix and I-IP
   address of next hop.  The mappings determine which I-IP destination
   address will be used to encapsulate the received packet's according
   to its E-IP destination address.  The definitions of E-IP and I-IP
   are explained in section 4.1 of RFC 5565[RFC5565].

5.3.  The swmBGPNeighborTable Subtree

   The subtree provides softwire mesh BGP neighbor information of an
   AFBR.  It includes the address of the softwire mesh BGP peer, and the
   kind of tunnel that the AFBR would use to communicate with this BGP
   peer.

5.4.  The swmMIBConformance Subtree

   The subtree provides conformance information of MIB objects.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   The Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  Each logical interface (physical or virtual)
   has an ifEntry.  Tunnels are handled by creating logical interfaces
   (ifEntry).  Being a tunnel, softwire mesh has an entry in the
   Interface MIB, as well as an entry in IP Tunnel MIB.  Those
   corresponding entries are indexed by ifIndex.

   The ifOperStatus in the ifTable would be used to represents whether
   the mesh function of the AFBR has been triggered.  If the software
   mesh capability is negotiated during the BGP OPEN phase, the mesh
   function is considered to be started, and the ifOperStatus is "up".
   Otherwise the ifOperStatus is "down".

   In the case of IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mesh tunnel, the ifInUcastPkts
   counts the number of IPv6 packets which are sent to the virtual
   interface for decapsulation into IPv4.  The ifOutUcastPkts counts the
   number of IPv6 packets which are generated by encapsulating IPv4
   packets sent to the virtual interface.  Particularly, if these IPv4
   packets need fragmentation, ifOutUcastPkts counts the number of
   packets after fragmentation.

Internet-Draft                   swmMIB                    February 2013


   In the case of IPv6-over-IPv4 softwire mesh tunnel, the ifInUcastPkts
   counts the number of IPv4 packets, which are sent to the virtual
   interface for decapsulation into IPv6.  The ifOutUcastPkts counts the
   number of IPv4 packets, which are generated by encapsulating IPv6
   packets sent to the virtual interface.  Particularly, if these IPv6
   packets need to be fragmented, tifOutUcastPkts counts the number of
   packets after fragmentation.  Similar definition apply to other
   counting objects in ifTable.

6.2.  Relationship to the IP Tunnel MIB

   The IP Tunnel MIB [RFC4087] contains objects applicable to all IP
   tunnels, including softwire mesh.  On the other hand, Softwire Mesh
   MIB extends the IP tunnel MIB to further describe encapsulation-
   specific information.

   Running a point to multi-point tunnel, it is necessary for a softwire
   mesh AFBR to maintain an encapsulation table, used to perform correct
   "forwarding" among AFBRs.  This forwarding on an AFBR is performed by
   using the E-IP destination address to look up the I-IP encapsulation
   destination address in the encapsulation table.  An AFBR also needs
   to know the BGP peer information of the other AFBRs, so that it can
   negotiate the NLRI-NH information and the tunnel parameters with
   them.

   Softwire mesh requires the implmentation of the IP Tunnel MIB.  The
   tunnelIfEncapsMethod in the tunnelIfEntry should be set to
   softwireMesh("xx"), and corresponding entry in the softwire mesh MIB
   module will exist for this tunnelIfEntry.  The
   tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress must be set to 0.0.0.0 for IPv4 or :: for
   IPv6 because it is a point to multi-point tunnel.

   Since tunnelIfAddressType in tunnelIfTable represents the type of
   address in the corresponding tunnelIfLocalInetAddress and
   tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress objects, we can use this semantic to
   specify the type of the softwire mesh, which is either IPv4-over-IPv6
   or IPv6-over-IPv4.  When tunnelIfAddressType is IPv4, the mesh is
   IPv6-over-IPv4; When tunnelIfAddressType is IPv6, the encapsulation
   would be IPv4-over-IPv6.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863] and
   INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001].

8.  Security Considerations

   The swmMIB module can be used for configuration of certain objects,
   and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly configured,
   with potentially disastrous results.  Because this MIB module reuses
   the IP tunnel MIB, the security considerations of the IP tunnel MIB
   is also applicable to the Softwire mesh MIB.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator's
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry, and
   the following IANA-assigned tunnelType values recorded in the
   IANAtunnelType-MIB registry:

           Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
           ----------        -----------------------
           swmMIB            { transmission XXX }
