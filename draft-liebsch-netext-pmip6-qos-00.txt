            Quality of Service Option for Proxy Mobile IPv6
                 draft-liebsch-netext-pmip6-qos-00.txt

Abstract

   This specification defines a new mobility option that can be used by
   the mobiliy entities in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain for exchanging
   the Quality of Service parameters associated with the subscriber
   flows.  Specifically, the local mobility anchor in the home network
   can potentially send the QoS parameters to the mobile access gateway
   in the access network.  This document also explains how the mobile
   access gateway in the access network can map the received QoS options
   to the access specific semantics, such us using 802.11e in case of
   IEEE 802.11 and apply it on the air interface.

Internet-Draft      QoS Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6       October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Mobile operators deploy Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] to
   enable network-based mobility management for mobile nodes (MN).
   Users can access Internet Protocol (IP) based services from their
   mobile device by using different radio access technologies.  Current
   standardization effort considers strong QoS classification and
   enforcement for cellular radio access technologies.  QoS policies are
   typically controlled by a policy control function, whereas the
   policies are enforced by different gateways in the infrastructure,
   such as the LMA.  Cellular radio access technology introduces the
   concept of a bearer.  Each mobile node can have one or multiple
   bearers associated with its registration, each supporting different
   QoS characteristics.  The bearer concept is not valid for alternative
   radio access technologies; however, these technologies specify their
   own concepts to enable QoS differentiation.  Handover and IP Flow
   Mobility using alternative radio access technologies, such as
   IEEE802.16 and Wireless LAN according to the IEEE802.11
   specification, are being considered by the standards [TS23.402],
   whereas inter-working between the cellular architecture to establish
   QoS policies in alternative access networks has not been focussed on
   so far.

   In particular the Wireless LAN technology has been identified as
   promising alternative technology to complement cellular radio access.
   Since the 802.11e standard provides QoS extensions to WLAN, it is
   beneficial to apply QoS policies to the WLAN access, which enables
   QoS classification of downlink as well as uplink traffic between a UE
   and its LMA.  Three functional operations have been identified to
   accomplish this:

      (a) Maintenance of QoS classification during a handover between
      cellular radio access and WLAN access by means of establishing QoS
      policies in the handover target access network,

      (b) mapping of QoS classes and associated policies between
      different access systems and

      (c) establishment of QoS policies for new data sessions/flows,
      which are initiated while using WLAN access.

   This document specifies an extension to the PMIPv6 protocol, which
   enables the transport of established QoS descriptions between an LMA
   and the MAG by means of a QoS container option in case the QoS policy
   in the WLAN access is not under explicit control of a policy control
   system.  The specified option allows association between IP session
   keys, such as a Differeniated Services Code Point (DSCP), and the
   expected QoS class for this IP session.  Further handling of QoS

   policies between the MAG and the WLAN Controller or WLAN Access Point
   is out of scope of this specification.

2.  Conventions & Terminology

2.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications
   [RFC5213], [RFC5844], [RFC5845] and [RFC5846].  Additionally, this
   document uses the following abbreviations:

   o  WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) - A wireless network.

   o  WTP (Wireless Termination Point): The entity that functions as the
      termination point for the network-end of the IEEE 802.11 based air
      interface from the mobile node.  It is also knows as the Wireless
      Access Point.

   o  WLC (Wireless LAN Controller): The entity that provides the
      centralized forwarding, routing function for the user traffic.
      All the user traffic from the mobile nodes attached to the WTP's
      is typically tunneled to this centralized WLAN access controller.

3.  Solution Overview

   The following illustrates the scenario where the local mobility
   anchor in the cellular network provides QoS policy to the mobile
   access gateway in the WLAN access network.  Other access technologies
   are also possible.

4.  Quality of Service Option

   A new option, Quality of Service option, is defined for using it in
   Proxy Binding Update (PBU) and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBA)
   messages exchanged between a local mobility anchor and a mobile
   access gateway.  This option is used for providing QoS policies and
   information to the mobile access gateway.

   The alignment requirement for this option is 4n.

   o  Type: To be assigned by IANA

   o  Length: 8-bit unsigned integer indicating the length in octets of
      the option, excluding the type and length fields.

   o  Reserved : This field is unused for now.  The value MUST be
      initialized to 0 by the sender and MUST be ignored by the
      receiver.

   o  TS Format: An 8-bit unsigned integer indicating the Traffic
      Selector Format.  Value "0" is reserved and MUST NOT be used.  The
      value of (1) is assigned for IPv4 Binary Traffic Selector
      [RFC6088].

   o  TS Selector : variable-length opaque field for including the
      traffic specification identified by the TS format field.  When the
      value of TS Format field is set to (1), the format that follows is

      [RFC6088].

   o  DSCP: An 6-bit unsigned integer indicating the code point value,
      as defined in [RFC2475] to be used for the flow.

   o  QoS Information: one or more Type-Length-Value (TLV) encoded QoS
      parameters.  The interpretation and usage of the QoS information
      is specific to the TLV.  The QoS information MUST at least contain
      a DSCP value indicating the code point value, as defined in
      [RFC2475] to be used for the flow.  [Discussion: which existing
      QoS definition to reuse?  There are several around even in IETF
      space.  RFC5624 is one potential as it already uses TLV encoding
      and is indirectly used by 23.402

6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines a new Mobility Header option, Quality of
   Service option.  This option is described in Section 4.  The Type
   value for this option needs to be assigned from the same numbering
   space as allocated for the other mobility options [RFC6275].

7.  Security Considerations

   The quality of service option defined in this specification is for
   use in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   messages.  This option is carried like any other mobility header
   option as specified in [RFC5213] and does not require any special
   security considerations.  Carrying quality of service information
   does not introduce any new security vulnerabilities.
