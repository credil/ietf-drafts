Internet-Draft       JSON Private and Symmetric Key        December 2012


1.  Introduction

   The JSON Private Key specification extends the JSON Web Key (JWK)
   [JWK] and JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specifications to define
   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] representations of
   private and symmetric keys.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the same terminology as the JSON Web Key
   (JWK) [JWK] and JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specifications.


3.  JWK Parameters for Private Keys

   This section defines additional JSON Web Key parameters that enable
   JWKs to represent private keys.

3.1.  JWK Parameters for Elliptic Curve Private Keys

   When the JWK "kty" member value is "EC", the following member MAY be
   used to represent an Elliptic Curve private key:

3.1.1.  "d" (ECC Private Key) Parameter

   The "d" (ECC private key) member contains the Elliptic Curve private
   key value.  It is represented as the base64url encoding of the
   value's unsigned big endian representation as a byte array.  The
   array representation MUST not be shortened to omit any leading zero
   bytes.  For instance, when representing 521 bit integers, the byte
   array to be base64url encoded MUST contain 66 bytes, including any
   leading zero bytes.

3.2.  JWK Parameters for RSA Private Keys

   When the JWK "kty" member value is "RSA", the following member MAY be
   used to represent an RSA private key:

Internet-Draft       JSON Private and Symmetric Key        December 2012


3.2.1.  "d" (Private Exponent) Parameter

   The "d" (private exponent) member contains the private exponent value
   for the RSA private key.  It is represented as the base64url encoding
   of the value's unsigned big endian representation as a byte array.
   The array representation MUST not be shortened to omit any leading
   zero bytes.  For instance, when representing 2048 bit integers, the
   byte array to be base64url encoded MUST contain 256 bytes, including
   any leading zero bytes.

3.2.2.  "p" (First Prime Factor) Parameter

   The "p" (first prime factor) member contains the first prime factor,
   a positive integer.  It is represented as the base64url encoding of
   the value's unsigned big endian representation as a byte array.

3.2.3.  "q" (Second Prime Factor) Parameter

   The "q" (second prime factor) member contains the second prime
   factor, a positive integer.  It is represented as the base64url
   encoding of the value's unsigned big endian representation as a byte
   array.

3.2.4.  "dp" (First Factor CRT Exponent) Parameter

   The "dp" (first factor CRT exponent) member contains the Chinese
   Remainder Theorem (CRT) exponent of the first factor, a positive
   integer.  It is represented as the base64url encoding of the value's
   unsigned big endian representation as a byte array.

3.2.5.  "dq" (Second Factor CRT Exponent) Parameter

   The "dq" (second factor CRT exponent) member contains the Chinese
   Remainder Theorem (CRT) exponent of the second factor, a positive
   integer.  It is represented as the base64url encoding of the value's
   unsigned big endian representation as a byte array.

3.2.6.  "qi" (First CRT Coefficient) Parameter

   The "dp" (first CRT coefficient) member contains the Chinese
   Remainder Theorem (CRT) coefficient of the second factor, a positive
   integer.  It is represented as the base64url encoding of the value's
   unsigned big endian representation as a byte array.

3.2.7.  "oth" (Other Primes Info) Parameter

   The "oth" (other primes info) member contains an array of information
   about any third and subsequent primes, should they exist.  When only

   two primes have been used (the normal case), this parameter MUST be
   omitted.  When three or more primes have been used, the number of
   array elements MUST be the number of primes used minus two.  Each
   array element MUST be an object with the following members:

3.2.7.1.  "r" (Prime Factor)

   The "r" (prime factor) parameter within an "oth" array member
   represents the value of a subsequent prime factor, a positive
   integer.  It is represented as the base64url encoding of the value's
   unsigned big endian representation as a byte array.

3.2.7.2.  "d" (Factor CRT Exponent)

   The "d" (Factor CRT Exponent) parameter within an "oth" array member
   represents the CRT exponent of the corresponding prime factor, a
   positive integer.  It is represented as the base64url encoding of the
   value's unsigned big endian representation as a byte array.

3.2.7.3.  "t" (Factor CRT Coefficient)

   The "t" (factor CRT coefficient) parameter within an "oth" array
   member represents the CRT coefficient of the corresponding prime
   factor, a positive integer.  It is represented as the base64url
   encoding of the value's unsigned big endian representation as a byte
   array.


4.  JWK Parameters for Symmetric Keys

   When the JWK "kty" member value is "oct" (octet sequence), the
   following member MAY be used to represent a symmetric key (or another
   key whose value is a single octet sequence):

4.1.  "k" (Key Value) Parameter

   The "k" (key value) member contains the value of the symmetric (or
   other single-valued) key.  It is represented as the base64url
   encoding of the octet sequence containing the key value.


5.  Example Private Keys

   The following example JWK Set contains two keys represented as JWKs
   containing both public and private key values: one using an Elliptic
   Curve algorithm and a second one using an RSA algorithm.  This
   example extends the example in Section 3 of [JWK], adding private key
   values.  (Line breaks are for display purposes only.)

6.  Example Symmetric Keys

   The following example JWK Set contains two symmetric keys represented
   as JWKs: one designated as being for use with the AES Key Wrap
   algorithm and a second one that is an HMAC key.  (Line breaks are for

8.  Security Considerations

   All of the security issues faced by any cryptographic application
   must be faced by a JWS/JWE/JWK agent.  Among these issues are
   protecting the user's private and symmetric keys, preventing various
   attacks, and helping the user avoid mistakes such as inadvertently
   encrypting a message for the wrong recipient.  The entire list of
   security considerations is beyond the scope of this document.

   Private and symmetric keys must be protected from disclosure to
   unintended parties.  One recommended means of doing so is to encrypt
   JWKs or JWK Sets containing them by using the JWK or JWK Set value as
   the plaintext of a JWE.

   A key is no more trustworthy than the method by which it was

   received.

   The security considerations in RFC 3447 [RFC3447] and RFC 6030
   [RFC6030] about protecting private and symmetric keys also apply to
   this specification.
