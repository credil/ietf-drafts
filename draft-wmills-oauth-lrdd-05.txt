Internet-Draft     Link Type Registrations for OAuth 2      October 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines the link type [RFC5988] registrations for the
   OAuth 2 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] authentication framework and for OAuth
   1.0a [RFC5849].  These link types are used during the endpoint
   discovery process using Web Host Metadata [RFC6415] and Webfinger
   [I-D.ietf-appsawg-webfinger] by clients needing to discover the
   authorization, token, and initiation endpoints for a service or site.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms used in the OAuth
   2 and OAuth 1.0a specifcations.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document is informational, defining values in existing
   registries, and as such has no security properties to discuss.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Link Type Registration

   Pursuant to [RFC5988] The following link type registrations [[will
   be]] registered by mail to link-relations@ietf.org.

4.1.1.  OAuth 2 Registrations

   OAuth 2 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] defines two endpoints which a site or
   domain might need to advertize via a mechanism such as Webfinger
   [I-D.ietf-appsawg-webfinger].  These are the user authorization
   endpoint (usually expected to be a web page the user interacts with)
   and the token endpoint used for obtaining tokens used to access other
   services, and are described in detail in the OAuth 2 specification.

4.1.1.1.  OAuth 2 Authorization Endpoint

   o  Relation Name: oauth2-authorize

   o  Description: An OAuth 2 authorization endpoint.

   o  Reference: [[This Document]]

   o  Notes: This link type indicates an OAuth 2 authorization endpoint
      that can be used for user authentication/authorization for the
      endpoint providing the link.

   o  Application Data: N/A

4.1.1.2.  OAuth 2 Token Endpoint

   o  Relation Name: oauth2-token

   o  Description: The OAuth 2 token endpoint used to get tokens for
      access.

   o  Reference: [[This Document]]

   o  Notes: The OAuth 2 token endpoint to be used for obtaining tokens
      to access the endpoint providing the link.

   o  Application Data: This link type has two link-extensions:

      grant-types:  A space separated list of OAuth 2 grant types (see
         section 4 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2]) that can be used at the token
         endpoint to obtain a token.  This is not an exclusive list, it
         provides a hint to the application of what SHOULD be valid.  A

         token endpoint MAY support additional grant types not
         advertised by a discovery service.  The client MAY use this to
         determine the grant types available for use.

      token-types:  A space separated list of OAuth 2 token types (see
         section 7.1 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2]) that may be issued by the
         token endpoint.  It is possible for a token endpoint to issue
         multiple tokens, and types may vary based on scope or other
         factors.  This is not an exclusive list, it provides a hint to
         the application of what SHOULD be valid, and it MAY be used by
         a client to determine if the client supports one or more of the
         token type(s) available.

4.1.2.  OAuth 1.0a Registrations

   The OAuth 1.0a [RFC5849] protocol defines three endpoints that a site
   supporting OAuth 1.0a might advertize via a mechanism like Webfinger:
   the request initiation endpoint, the authorization endpoint, and the
   token endpoint.  Each of these are descibed in detail in the OAuth
   1.0a specification.

4.1.2.1.  OAuth 1.0a Request Initiation Endpoint

   o  Relation Name: oauth-initiate

   o  Description: The OAuth 1.0a request initiation endpoint used to
      get an access request.

   o  Reference: [[This Document]]

   o  Notes: The OAuth 1.0a endpoint used to initiate the sequence, this
      short lived request is what the user approves to grant access to
      the resource.

   o  Application Data:

4.1.2.2.  OAuth 1.0a Authorization Endpoint

   o  Relation Name: oauth-authorize

   o  Description: The OAuth 1.0a authorization endpoint used to approve
      an access request.

   o  Reference: [[This Document]]

   o  Notes:

   o  Application Data: N/A

4.1.2.3.  OAuth 1.0a Token Endpoint

   o  Relation Name: oauth-token

   o  Description: The OAuth 1.0a token endpoint used to exchange an
      approved access request for a token.

   o  Reference: [[This Document]]

   o  Notes:

   o  Application Data: N/A
