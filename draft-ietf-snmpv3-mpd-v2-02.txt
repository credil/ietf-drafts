This document describes the Message Processing and Dispatching for
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) messages within the SNMP
architecture.  It defines the procedures for dispatching potentially
multiple versions of SNMP messages to the proper SNMP Message
Processing Models, and for dispatching PDUs to SNMP applications.
This document also describes one Message Processing Model - the SNMPv3
Message Processing Model.  This document obsoletes RFC 2572.

This document is a product of the SNMPv3 Working Group of the IETF.
