      <t>In many protocol specifications and related documents, special conformance terms (e.g., the uppercase words "MUST", "SHOULD", and "MAY") are often used to signify requirement levels.  This document defines these conformance terms and describes how they are to be interpreted in documents produced within the Internet Standards Process.

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
      <t>In many protocol specifications and related documents, special conformance terms (e.g., the uppercase words "MUST", "SHOULD", and "MAY") are often used to signify requirement levels.  This document defines these conformance terms and describes how they are to be interpreted in documents produced within the Internet Standards Process <xref target='BCP9'/>.  If approved, this document obsoletes RFC 2119 and changes its status to Historic.</t>
      <t>The discussion venue for this document is the &lt;ietf@ietf.org&gt; mailing list, for which archives and subscription information are available at &lt;https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf&gt;.</t>
      <t>[[ NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Upon publication, please remove the foregoing paragraph. ]]</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Definitions" anchor="defs">
      <section title='MUST' anchor='defs-must'>
        <t>This term means that the feature or behavior is an absolute requirement of the specification, so that an implementation has an obligation to implement the feature or to behave as defined.  The terms "SHALL" and "REQUIRED" are equivalent to "MUST".</t>
      </section>
      <section title='MUST NOT' anchor='defs-mustnot'>
        <t>This term means that the feature or behavior is an absolute prohibition of the specification, so that an implementation has an obligation to not implement the feature or to not behave as defined.  The term "SHALL NOT" is equivalent to "MUST NOT".</t>
      </section>
      <section title='SHOULD' anchor='defs-should'>
        <t>This term means that the feature or behavior is a conditional requirement of the specification, so that an implementation has an obligation to implement the feature or to behave as defined unless there is a strong reason why it might be prudent not to do so in particular circumstances.   Specification authors are strongly encouraged to clearly describe such reasons, along with the implications of not conforming with the conditional requirement.  Those who implement the specification or deploy conformant technologies need to understand and carefully weigh the full implications of not conforming to the conditional requirement before doing so.  The term "RECOMMENDED" is equivalent to "SHOULD".</t>
      </section>
      <section title='SHOULD NOT' anchor='defs-shouldnot'>
        <t>This term means that the feature or behavior is a conditional prohibition of the specification, so that an implementation has an obligation to not implement the feature or to not behave as defined unless there is a strong reason why it might be prudent to do so in particular circumstances.  Specification authors are strongly encouraged to clearly describe such reasons, along with the implications of not conforming with the conditional prohibition.  Those who implement the specification or deploy conformant technologies need to understand and carefully weigh the full implications of not conforming to the conditional prohibition before doing so.  The term "NOT RECOMMENDED" is equivalent to "SHOULD NOT".</t>
      </section>
      <section title='MAY' anchor='defs-may'>
        <t>This term means that the feature or behavior is purely discretionary.  One implementation can choose to implement the feature or behavior whereas another implementation can choose not to, without any resulting harm to interoperability.  An implementation that does not implement the feature or behavior needs to interoperate with another implementation that does do so, although perhaps with reduced functionality.  Likewise, an implementation that implements the feature or behavior needs to interoperate with another implementation that does not do so (except, of course, with respect to the defined feature or behavior).  The term "OPTIONAL" is equivalent to "MAY".</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Usage" anchor="Usage">
      <t>The conformance terms defined in this document ought to be used judiciously.  In particular, the absolute and conditional requirements and prohibitions ought be used only to specify features and behaviors that are necessary for interoperability, or to forbid features and behaviors that have the potential to cause significant harm.  For example, such terms are not to be used to impose a particular method on implementers if the method is not necessary for interoperability.</t>
      <t>When it is not appropriate to use the conformance terms, authors can use a variety of alternative words and phrases, such as: "need to" or "mandatory" instead of "MUST"; "ought to" or "strongly encouraged" instead of "SHOULD"; and "might" or "discretionary" instead of "MAY".  To prevent confusion, authors ought to use these alternative words and phrases instead of the lowercase versions of the conformance terms, and to use the conformance terms only in their uppercase versions.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Boilerplate" anchor="boilerplate">
      <t>In order for the requirements force of the conformance terms to apply, authors who follow the guidelines specified herein need to incorporate this sentence near the beginning of their documents:</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>The following conformance terms are to be interpreted as described in [RFC&rfc.number;]: "MUST", "SHALL", "REQUIRED"; "MUST NOT", "SHALL NOT"; "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED"; "SHOULD NOT", "NOT RECOMMENDED"; "MAY", "OPTIONAL".</t></list></t>
      <t>[[ NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Upon publication, please change "&rfc.number;" to the number assigned to this document. ]]</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
      <t>The conformance terms defined in this document are frequently used to specify features and behaviors that have security implications.  The effects on security of not implementing a "MUST" or a "SHOULD", or of doing something the specification says "MUST NOT" or "SHOULD NOT" be done, can be very subtle.  Specification authors are strongly encouraged to clearly describe the security implications of not conforming to absolute and conditional requirements, since implementers might not have the benefit of the experience and discussion that produced the specification.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="iana">
      <t>This document requests no actions of the IANA.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Acknowledgements" anchor="acks">
      <t>This document borrows text from <xref target='RFC2119'/>; Scott Bradner, the author of that document, is gratefully acknowledged.</t>
      <t>Thanks also to Harald Alvestrand and Julian Reschke for their feedback.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Differences from RFC 2119" anchor="diffs">
      <t>The following modifications were made from RFC 2119.</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Clarified the definitions to specify that features and behaviors are absolutely required ("MUST"), absolutely prohibited ("MUST NOT"), conditionally required ("SHOULD"), conditionally prohibited ("SHOULD NOT"), or purely discretionary ("MAY").</t>
          <t>Expanded the definitions of "SHOULD" and "SHOULD NOT" to include the notion of conforming unless there is a strong reason to do so, and encouraged specification authors to clearly describe such reasons and the implications of not conforming.</t>
          <t>Suggested alternative words and phrases for use when the conformance terms are not appropriate.</t>
          <t>Encourage use of the conformance terms only in their uppercase versions.</t>
          <t>Modified the title to use the phrase "conformance terms" instead of the phrase "key words".</t>
          <t>Modified the boilerplate to include "NOT RECOMMENDED" (erratum #499) and to group similar terms together.</t>

<abstract>
<t>
   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:
<list>
<t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.
</t></list></t>
<t>
   Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
   level of the document in which they are used.
