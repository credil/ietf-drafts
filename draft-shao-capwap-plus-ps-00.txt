                Enhancement of CAPWAP Problem Statement
                      draft-shao-capwap-plus-ps-00

Abstract

   With the recent widely deployment of large public Wifi network, and
   the integration with cellular network.  EAP based authentication has
   been considered as the good candidate to improve the Wifi user
   experience similarly to the extend of GSM network.  Couple of new
   functions which could enhance CAPWAP protocol have been raised to
   improve the large carrier grade Wifi network.

1.  Introduction

   Public Wifi service has been paid more attention due to the growth of
   cellular data traffic, this is mainly originated from faster mobile
   network and more smart terminals.  It is predcited that such growth
   will continue even with the deployment of LTE network.  The capacity
   and coverage of LTE network still needs the complementation of public
   wifi network because Wifi spectrum is free, limited and globally
   available. and almost all smart terminal has the Wifi equiped.

   Recent efforts have been made to let Wifi roaming similar to as easy
   as legacy cellular GSM network by deploying EAP based authentication
   mechanism, and to let mobile to Wifi integration is seamless and
   transparent to the customer; Toward this two directions, current
   CAPWAP protocol could be enhanced to improve better user experiences.

   There have been lots of propritary implementations between AP and AC
   interfaces, some of them have very strong capability which could be
   used to improve the wifi performance.  Once Standard interface is
   specified, such merits may be not exist, but it benefit for operators
   deployment with such sacrifice.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Supporting EAP authencation in Wifi network

   Current EAP message is designed to be transmited in CAPWAP data
   plane, AC in the middle of data path will act as the authenticator to
   transmit this EAP message to AAA server, but sometime, operator would
   like to let AC to be in the bypass of the data plane which could help
   to improve the performance of AC, allow it can manage more APs once
   the network is growing.  In order to allow AC be bypassed, the capwap
   control message could be extended to support EAP messages.

3.1.  Scenario Description

   The following figure shows where and how the problem arises.  In many
   operators' network, the Access Controller is placed remotely at the
   central data center.  In order to avoid the traffic aggregation at
   the AC, the data plane out of the AP is directed to the Access Router
   (AR).  In this scenario, the CAPWAP-CTL tunnel and CAPWAP-DATA tunnel
   are separated from each other.

Internet-Draft                     DMM                      October 2012


   Because there are no explict message types to support the
   encapsulation of EAP packets in the CAPWAP-CTL tunnel, the EAP
   messages are tunneled via the CAPWAP-DATA plane to the AR.  AR acts
   as authenticator in the EAP framework.  After authentication, the AR
   receives the keying message for the session.  But AC is supposed to
   delieve these keying messages to the AP, and AR has no standard
   interface to ship them to the AP or the AC.  This is unacceptable in
   the scenario of EAP-based auto-authentication.
            CAPWAP-CTL +--------+
             ++========+   AC   |
            //         +--------+
           //
   +-----+//   CAPWAP-DATA           +--------------+
   | AP  |===========================| Access Router|
   +-----+                           +--------------+


         Figure 1: Split between CAPWAP-CTL and CAPWAP-DATA Plane

   So it is desirable to encapsulate EAP messages in the CAPWAP-CTL
   plane, to avoid data aggregation and improve WLAN system scalability.


4.  The scope of definition of split MAC mode

   There are many functions hasn't been clearly defined whether they
   belong to either AP and AC in the split mode.  Operation needs to
   configure differently handle the various implementation of split MAC
   mode. if there is no clear scope definition of split MAC and local
   MAC, then operator has the diffculty to interoperate different
   vendors.


5.  802.11n support

   There are couple of capabilities of 802.11n need to be supported by
   CAPWAP control message such as radio capability, radio configuration
   and station information.

   IEEE 802.11n standard was published in 2009 and it is an amendment to
   the IEEE 802.11-2007 standard to improve network throughput.  The
   maximum data rate increases to 600Mbit/s physical throughput rate.
   In the physical layer, 802.11n use OFDM and MIMO to achive the high
   throughput. 802.11n use multiple antennas to form antenna array which
   can be dynamically adjusted to imporve the signal strength and extend
   the coverage.

   802.11n support two modes of channel usage: 20MHz mode and 40Mhz

   mode.802.11n has a new feature called channel binding.  It can bind
   two adjacent 20MHz channel to one 40MHz channel to improve the
   throughput.If using 40Mhz channel configuration there will be only
   one non-overlapping channel in 2.4GHz.  In the large scale deployment
   scenario, operator need to use 20MHz channel configuration in 2.4GHz
   to allow more non-overlapping channels.

   In MAC layer, a new feature of 802.11n is Short Guard Interval(GI).
   802.11a/g use 800ns guard interval between the adjacent information
   symbols.  In 802.11n, the GI can be configured to 400nm under good
   wireless condition.

   Another feature in 802.11 MAC layer is Block ACK. 802.11n can use one
   ACK frame to acknowledge several MPDU receiving event.

   CAPWAP need to be extended to support the above new 802.11n features.
   For example, CAPWAP should allow the access controller to know the
   supported 802.11n features and the access controller should be able
   to configure the differe channel binding modes.  One possible
   solution is to extend the CAPWAP information element for 802.11n.


6.  Channel auto reconfiguration

   Channel auto reconfiguration could imporve the Wifi performance,
   CAPWAP message could be extended to support this function.

   Each channel may provide different quality of service, when WTP
   works.  WTP can be active or passive scanning and monitoring each
   channel, form the report of measurement results to the Access
   Controller.  WTP can periodically send configure status request to
   the AC.  According to the current channel quality and other channel
   quality scanning report, ACs decide whether modify the channel to be
   used, send the configure status response packet to set up a new
   channel for the WTP.


7.  Power auto reconfiguration

   Power auto reconfiguration could imporve the Wifi performance.
   CAPWAP message could be extended to achieve following outcome.

   o  Maximize Spectrum Usage: Real-world Wi-Fi deployments are
      depending on the features of shared media.  Three channels
      available in the 2.4GHz band and 23 channels in the 5GHz band.
      Power auto reconfiguration could help these channels be fully
      utilized.  As the results, clients could be distributed across all
      available channels.

   o  Reduce Interference: when multiple devices attempt to
      simutaneously access the same channel at the same time, a co-
      channel interference likely happned.  It reduces overall
      performance of the channel.  The reconfiguration via CAPWAP could
      efficiently mitigate the interference.  That is essential to
      proper network operation
   o  Optimize Coverage: Simply increasing AP power may not help to
      maximize converage because it creates an unbalanced condition in
      which more distantly located clients may perforIm poorly due to
      their lower transmit output power.  The power reconfiguration
      could achieve a balanced environment, where configuration could
      ensure that coverage is uniform and adequate throughout the
      service area.
