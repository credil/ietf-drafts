1.  Introduction

   Traditional routing and forwarding uses the concept of path as the
   basic routing paradigm to get a packet from a source to a destination
   by following an ordered sequence of arrows between intermediate
   nodes.  In this serial design, a path is broken as soon as a single
   arrow is, and getting around a breakage can require path
   recomputation, network reconvergence, and incur delays to till
   service is restored.

   Available Routing Constructs [I-D.thubert-rtgwg-arc] (ARC) introduces
   the concept of ARC as a routing construct made of a sequence of nodes
   and links with 2 outgoing edges, that is this resilient to one
   breakage so that an ARC topology is resilient to one breakage per
   ARC.

   The routing graph to reach a certain destination is expressed as a
   cascade of ARCs, which terminates in an abstract destination Omega,
   each ARC providing its own independent domain of fault isolation and
   recovery:



                          +========I========+
                          |                 |

                       Figure 1: ARC Representation

   This cascade of ARCs appears ideally suited to the operation of
   bicasting (a.k.a. duocasting), which consists in sending two copies
   of a single packet, if possible over divergent - that is fully or
   partially non-congruent - paths, in order to augment the chances that
   at least one of the copies reaches the destination timely.

2.  Terminology

   The draft uses the terminology defined in [I-D.thubert-rtgwg-arc].

   This specificatin also introduces Sided ARCs, that is ARCs with at
   least an Edge that is known as Left and an Edge that is known as
   Right.  The sense of Left and Right adds up to the existing sense of
   height that is already defined in [I-D.thubert-rtgwg-arc].

          |                 L======A=======R                     |
          |                 |              |                     |
 ------------------------------------------------------------------Omega


                         Figure 2: Orienting ARCs

   One way of doing this is

   o  The basic rule is that an ARC MUST have at least one Left and one
      Right Edge.

   o  The leg of an ARC between the cursor and the Edge inherits the
      side of the Edge.  In a Comb, the whole buttressing ARC inherits
      the side of the Edge.

   o  An Edge ending in Omega can arbitrarily become Left or Right as
      long as the basic rule is satisfied.

   o  An Edge that does not end in Omega inherits the side of an ARC it
      terminates into, again as long as the basic rule is satisfied.

   o  A collision occurs if all the Edges end up on the same side.  The
      shortest path is used to resolve the collision and restore the
      basic rule: the Edge closer to Omega and all butressing ARCs on
      the same side of the cursor keep the side, and the other Edges are
      toggled.  In case of equal cost, an other tie breaker must be
      used.

   o  For instance, this situation occurs in the representation above
      for ARC F, which has both ends ending in a Right side of ARCs, and
      since the Edge closer to Omega is the one that ends in ARC C, that
      Edge becomes Right and the other becomes Left.


3.  Downward Bicasting Operation

   Two copies of a same packet from a given node are forwarded downwards
   along opposite side of the cascading ARCs, each packet bearing an
   indication (such as a tag or a label) of its intended side, Left or
   Right.

   The packets exit the ARCs along their paths through an Edge that
   matches the indication in the packet.

                  Figure 3: Bicasting Down an ARC ascade

   As it goes, the method does not guarantee a full non congruence of
   the paths, as illustrated above.  In case of a breakage, this can be
   compensated by the capability to return a packet along an ARC upon a
   failure, that is already used to protect unicast traffic.

4.  Upward Bicasting Operations

   It is also possible with a downward bicasting to place states in the
   intermediate routers in order to provision an upward bicast path from
   Omega to a source D. In that case, if the graph is biconnected, it is
   possible to resolve the pathological cases so as to ensure a real
   separation of the left and Right paths.

4.1.  Resolving crossing ARCs

   The first pathological case occurs when both Left and Right packet
   cross over the same ARC, as illustrated below.  Say that the Right
   reservation comes first and sets up the right path:


                             r           |
            R====D====L   L==rrrrrrrr  L====F====R  R===G====L
            |         |   |         r  |         |  |        |

          |                 |              r                     |
 ------------------------------------------------------------------Omega


                     Figure 5: crossing: Right packet

   Then comes the left reservation which collisions:

                Figure 6: crossing: left packet approaching

   The segment between the two incoming point of the common ARC is
   common to both path and expose the bicasted traffic.  The resolution
   is to leave the second packet through but prune the unwanted states
   along the collision segment of the ARC afterwards.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------Omega


                    Figure 7: crossing: Resolved state

   States along the ARC between the two incoming points are cleaned, up
   and the paths that were generated by the Left and Right packets are
   now crossed.  This results in two non-congruent upward paths.

4.2.  Single Point of Failure

   The second pathological case occurs when both Left and Right packet
   reach a same ARC at the same node, which is this a Single Point Of
   Failure (SPoF) for both paths.

                       Figure 8: SPoF: Right packet

   The resoution is to reject the second packet and send it back along
   the incoming ARC to exit on the other side.  The rejected packet
   clans up the states that it has created on its way back and then
   creates states on the other side of the ARC.

   This is in fact what happens also in the case of a monoconnected
   zone, or if a breakage cause the downward packet to bounce.

5.  Applicability

5.1.  In conjunction with Protocol Independent Multicast

   (To be refined in 01) Upwards bicasting can be used for Protocol
   Independent Multicast PIM [RFC4601] and Point-to-Multipoint and
   Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths mLDP [RFC6388].  A
   bicasted downards Join message would establish two non congruent
   return paths, each path joining the receiver and Omega that is the
   set of existing receivers.


6.  Manageability

   This specification describes a generic model.  Protocols and
   management will come later


7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not require IANA action.


8.  Security Considerations

   This specification is not found to introduce new security threat.
