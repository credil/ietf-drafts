Abstract

   This document contains recommendations of maximum tolerable delays to
   be added by methods which improve bandwidth utilization through
   compression, multiplexing, and tunneling over a network path.
   Recommendations are presented only for real-time network services for
   which such bandwidth optimization techniques are applicable (i.e.,
   services with low payload size to header size ratio).

Internet-Draft                  MTD-TCMTF                  December 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document extends the draft [TCMTF] with a set of recommendations
   of overall tolerable delays which can be added in the processes of
   compression, multiplexing, and tunneling.  These recommendations are
   needed, since the techniques proposed in [TCMTF], while saving
   bandwidth, add additional network delay.  Network delay is one of the
   main factors which can degrade the Quality of Experience (QoE) of
   real-time network services [TGPP_TR26.944].  In order to prevent QoE
   degradation of real-time services using TCMTF, a policy defining a
   multiplexing period can be employed.  Values of maximum tolerable
   delays presented here form the base of such policy.  The
   recommendations are presented for real-time network services in which
   TCTMF bandwidth optimization is applicable (i.e., services which have
   low payload to header size ratio which results in high protocol
   overhead).

   The second set of recommendations focuses on different multiplexing
   policies and implementation issues which are service and link
   specific.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Considered services

   Under the term "real-time network services" we consider both
   conversational and streaming service classes of services as defined
   in [TGPP_TS].  Interactive and background services are considered non
   real-time.  Fundamental requirements of real-time network services
   include conversational pattern (stringent and low delay) and
   preservation of the time relation (variation) between the information
   entities of the stream.

   We are focused on real-time network services which have low payload
   to header size ratio and therefore are appropriate for bandwith
   optimizations presented in TCMTF.  We identify the following
   services:

   o  Voice over IP

   o  Online games

   o  Remote desktop services

   While video services are considered real-time, they are not suitable
   for bandwidth optimization techniques proposed in [TCMTF], due to the
   high payload to header size ratio they present.  Therefore, we
   neither take into account services using an approach in which all the
   calculations are deployed in the server, which sends a real-time
   video stream to the client.  In these cases, TCMTF optimization is
   neither interesting nor applicable.  On the other hand, TCMTF can be
   applied for web browsing in terms of payload to header size ratio,
   but since some studies have shown that web browsing delays of several
   seconds are acceptable to users, there is no need for policy
   limitations in TCMTF, as the multiplexing periods are shorter than
   that [ITU-T_G.1010].


4.  Delay recommendations

   The three normally considered network impairments in the studies
   related to subjective quality in real-time interactive games are:

   o  delay - can be reported as one-way-delay (OWD) [RFC2679] and two-
      way-delay (Round Trip Time) [RFC2681].  In this document, under
      the term latency, one way end-to-end day is considered.

   o  jitter - which is a statistical variance of the data packet inter-
      arrival time, in other words the variation of the delay.

   o  packet loss - more important for certain applications, while other
      include very good algorithms for concealing it (e.g., some game
      genres).

   In this document we give recommendations of overal tollerable delays
   for previously listed real-time network services.  In an interactive
   service, the total delay is composed by the addition of delays as
   defined in 3GPP TR 26.944 [TGPP_TR26.944].

   o  Transfer delay - from Host1 to Host2 at time T is defined by the
      statement: Host1 sent the first bit of a unit data to Host2 at
      wire-time T and that Host2 received the last bit of that packet at
      wire-time T+dT

   o  Transaction delay - the sum of the time for a data packet to wait
      in queue and receive the service during the server transaction.

   Figure 1 shows these delays.  The labeled times (S and R) designate
   the times in which the packet is sent or received by the network card
   interface.

   The use of TCMTF requires the addition of a multiplexer and a
   demultiplexer in the scenario.  A number of flows are multiplexed
   together before being sent through the Internet.  The packets are
   demultiplexed and rebuilt before being forwarded to the application
   server.  An scheme of TCMTF is included in Figure 2:

        +------+

                                 Figure 2

   This technique groups packets in order to build a multiplexed one.
   So "multiplexing period" has to be defined in the multiplexer.  When

   it ends, all the arrived packets are sent together in the same
   bundle.  Therefore, multiplexing delay caused by tcmtf optimization
   techniques can be seen as an increase of transfer delay.  The delay
   in the multiplexer is caused by the time the packets are retained
   until the bundled packet is sent, plus processing time.  However, in
   the demultiplexer packets are not retained, so only processing time
   is considered.

   Figure 3 shows the total delay, when a multiplexer and a
   demultiplexer are added.  It should be noticed that multiplexing can
   be deployed independently in the two directions, or only in one of
   them, as shown in Figure 3.

   tradeoff appears: the longer the multiplexing period, the higher the
   number of packets which can be grouped, thus obtaining better
   bandwidth savings.  So in order to calculate the maximum multiplexing
   period, the rest of the delays have to be considered: if the sum of
   propagation, processing and transmission delays is under the maximum
   tolerable delay, then multiplexing will be possible without harming
   user's experience.  The calculation of the overal delay may be
   performed according to the ITU-T Y.1541 reccomendation [ITU-T_Y.1541]
   The difference will give the maximum recommended multiplexing period.

   Next, we will report the maximum tolerable latencies for the
   previously listed real-time network services.

4.1.  VoIP

   For conversational audio, the International Telecommunication Union
   recommends in [ITU-T_G.114] less than 150 millisecond one-way end-to-
   end delay for high-quality real time traffic, but delays between
   150ms and 400ms are acceptable.  For a streaming audio, delay
   constraints are much looser, the delay should be less than 10s
   [ITU-T_G.1010].

4.2.  Online games

   Online games are a large area comprising many game genres which have
   different latency requirements.  This draft focuses on real-time
   online games and endorses the general game categorization proposed in
   [Claypool_Latency] in which online games have been divided into:

   o  Omnipresent, with the threshold of acceptable latency (i.e.,
      latency in which performance is above 75% of the unimpaired
      performance) of 1000 ms.  The most representative genre of
      omnipresent games are Real-Time Strategies.

   o  Third Person Avatar, with the threshold of acceptable latency of
      500ms.  These games include include Role Playing Games (RPG) and
      Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG).

   o  First Person Avatar, in which threshold of acceptable latency is
      100ms.  The most popular subgenre of them are First Person
      Shooters, such as "Call of Duty" or "Halo" series.

   The study [Claypool_Latency] evaluated players' performance of
   certain tasks while increasing latency, and reported latencies in
   which the performance dropped below 75% of the performance under
   unimpaired network conditions.  While measuring objective performance
   metrics, this method highly underestimates the impact of delays on
   players' QoE.  Further studies accessing a particular game genre

Internet-Draft                  MTD-TCMTF                  December 2012


   reported much lower latency thresholds for unimpaired gameplay.

   A survey using a large number of First Person Shooter games was
   carried out in [Dick_Analysis].  As a result, they stated that
   latencies about 80ms could be considered as acceptable, since the
   games were rated as "unimpaired".  Besides service QoE, it has been
   shown that delay has great impact on the user's decision to join a
   game, but significantly lesser on the decision to leave the game
   [Henderson_QoS].

   A study oriented to evaluation of Mean Opinion Score (MOS), based on
   variation of delay and jitter for MMORPGs, suggested that MOS drops
   below 4 for delays greater than 120 ms [Ries_QoEMMORPG].  The MOS
   score of 5 indicates excellent quality, while MOS score of 1
   indicates bad quality.  Another study focused on extracting the
   duration of play sessions for MMORPGs from the network traffic traces
   showed that the session durations start to decline sharply when
   latency is between 150ms and 200ms latencies[Chen_HowSensitive].

   While original classification work [Claypool_Latency] states that
   latencies up to 1s are tolerated by omnipresent games, other studies
   argued that only latencies up to 200ms are tolerated by players of

4.3.  Remote desktop access

   For the services of remote computer access, the delays are dependent
   on the task performed through the remote desktop, which are
   categorized into audio, video and data (reading, web browsing,
   document creation).  A QoE study indicates that for audio latencies
   below 225 ms and for data latencies below 200 ms are tolerated
   [Dusi_Thin].

   We group all the results in the Table 1 indicating the maximum
   allowed of latencies and proposed multiplexing periods.  Proposed
   multiplexing periods are guidelines, since the exact values are
   dependant of existing the delay in the network.  It should be noted
   that multiplexing periods of about 1 second can be considered as
   enough for non real time services (e.g., web browsing and streaming
   audio).
