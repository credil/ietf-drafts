Internet-Draft      SIIT in Data Centre Environments       November 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document describes deploying SIIT [RFC6145] as a network-centric
   stateless translation service that allow a data centre operator or
   Internet content provider run his data centre network, servers, and
   applications using exclusively IPv6, while at the same time ensuring
   that end users that have only IPv4 connectivity will be able to
   continue to access the services and applications.

1.1.  Motivation and Goals

   Historically, dual stack [RFC4213] has been the recommended way to
   transition from an IPv4-only environment to one capable of serving
   IPv6 users.  For data centre and Internet content providers, however,
   dual stack operation has a number of disadvantages compared to single
   stack operation, in particular increased complexity and operational
   overhead, and very low expected return of investment in the short to
   medium term, as there are practically no end users who have only
   connectivity to the IPv6 Internet.  Furthermore, the dual stack
   approach does not in any way help with the depletion of the IPv4
   address space.

   Therefore, a better approach was needed.  The design goals were, in
   no particular order:

   o  To promote the deployment of native IPv6 services

   o  To provide IPv4 service availability for legacy users with no loss
      of performance or functionality

   o  To ensure that that the legacy users' IPv4 addresses remain
      available to the servers and applications

   o  To conserve and maximise the utilisation of IPv4 addresses

   o  To avoid introducing more complexity than absolutely necessary,
      especially on the servers and applications

   o  To be easy to scale and deploy in a fault-tolerant manner

   SIIT meets all of these requirements, which will be elaborated on in
   the following subsections.

1.1.1.  Single Stack IPv6 Operation

   SIIT allows an operator to build their applications on an IPv6-only
   foundation.  IPv4 end-user connectivity becomes a service provided by
   the network, which systems administration and application development



Anderson                  Expires May 13, 2013                  [Page 3]

   staff do not need to concern themselves with.

   Obviously, this will promote universal IPv6 deployment for all the
   provider's services and applications.

1.1.2.  Stateless Operation

   Unlike other solutions that provide either dual stack availability to
   single-stack services (e.g., Stateful NAT64 [RFC6146] and Layer-4/7
   proxies), or that provide conservation of IPv4 addresses (e.g., NAT44
   [RFC3022]), a SIIT gateway does not keep any state between each
   packet in a single connection/flow.  In this sense it operates
   exactly like a normal IP router, and has similar scaling properties -
   the limiting factors are packets per second and bandwidth.  The
   number of concurrent flows and flow initiation rates are irrelevant
   for performance.

   This not only allows individual SIIT gateways to easily attain "line
   rate" performance, it also allows for per-packet load balancing
   between multiple gateways using Equal-Cost Multipath Routing
   [RFC2991].  Asymmetric routing is also unproblematic, which makes it
   easy to avoid traffic trampolines, as the prefixes involved may be
   anycasted from all the SIIT gateways in the provider's network.

   Finally, stateless operation means that high availability is easily
   achieved.  If an SIIT gateway should fail, its traffic can be re-
   routed onto another SIIT gateway using completely standard IP routing
   protocols.  This will not impact existing flows any more than what
   any other IP re-routing event would.

1.1.3.  No Loss of End User's Source Address

   SIIT will map the entire end-user's source address into an predefined
   IPv6 translation prefix.  This allows the application server to
   identify the user by his IPv4 address, which is useful for performing
   tasks like Geo-Location, logging, abuse handling, and so forth.

1.1.4.  No Forklift Upgrades Required

   Except for the introduction of the SIIT gateways themselves, there is
   no change required in the network, servers, applications, or anywhere
   else to specifically support SIIT, compared to a dual stack
   deployment.  From the clients', the servers', the IPv6 data centre
   network's, and the IPv4 Internet's point of view, SIIT is practically
   invisible.  It will work with any standards-compliant IPv4 or IPv6
   stack.

Internet-Draft      SIIT in Data Centre Environments       November 2012


1.1.5.  No Architectural Dependency on IPv4

   SIIT will allow an ICP or data centre operator to build their
   infrastructure and applications entirely on IPv6.  This means that
   when the day comes to discontinue support for IPv4, no change needs
   to be made to the overall architecture - it's only a matter of
   shutting off the SIIT gateways.  Therefore, by deploying native IPv6
   along with SIIT, operators will avoid future migration or deployment
   projects relating to IPv6 roll-out and/or IPv4 sun-setting.

1.2.  Comparison to Other IPv6 Migration Strategies

1.2.1.  IPv4-only Service with Translation for IPv6 Users

   Typically, this migration strategy involves having an IPv4-only
   application stack, with some device in front that the IPv6 client
   connect to, who will then translate or proxy the traffic to the IPv4-
   only system.  This approach is probably the easiest to retrofit to an
   existing IPv6 service environment, however it does have a few
   shortcomings not shared by SIIT.  In particular:

   o  No conservation of IPv4 addresses

   o  The translator/proxy must be a stateful device, requiring traffic
      to flow symmetrically across a single instance, in turn giving the
      solution poor scaling properties and routing flexibility

   o  A fail-over event will disrupt all active flows, unless there is
      some state replication mechanism (which would likely increase
      complexity and hurt performance and scaling properties)

   o  Loss of the client's source IP address, if it cannot be injected
      into application-layer headers such as HTTP's X-Forwarded-For
      (which is impossible if the application layer is using encryption)

1.2.2.  Dual Stack

   Dual stack, unlike SIIT, considerably increases complexity and
   operational overhead compared to single stack operation for a number
   of reasons.  Some examples of this include:

   o  Duplicate work for design, set-up, documentation, and monitoring

   o  Duplicate ACLs in both network components and applications

   o  An exponential increase in possible failure scenarios

Internet-Draft      SIIT in Data Centre Environments       November 2012


   o  Increased application development and maintenance costs

   o  Increased need for staff training and competency

   Furthermore, dual stack does not help conserve IPv4 addresses.


2.  Architectural Overview

   This section attempts to explain the basic SIIT architecture by
   describing an example topology of a data centre hosting two IPv6-
   only customers:

   o  Alice, operating a publicly available web service.

   o  Bob, operating publicly available DNS and MX service.

   Since both Alice and Bob's server installations contain other servers
   that provide internal services, if they had used IPv4, they each
   would have needed their server LANs to be provisioned with at minimum
   a /29, thereby consuming 16 IPv4 addresses.  With SIIT, the IPv4
   address consumption is reduced to 3 - the same number of publicly
   available services.

   198.51.0.0/24 is allocated as a pool from which individual IPv4
   service addresses are drawn.  The provider must route this prefix to
   the SIIT gateway's IPv4 interface.  Note that there are no
   restrictions on how many IPv4 service address pools are used or their
   prefix length, as long as they are all routed to the SIIT gateway's
   IPv4 interface.

   The static address mappings are used for translating the service's
   IPv6 address into IPv4 and vice versa.  When translating from IPv4 to
   IPv6, any IPv4 address found in the list of static mappings will be

   rewritten to its corresponding IPv6 address, and vice versa when
   translating from IPv6 to IPv4.

   2001:db8:46::/96 is the IPv6 prefix into which the entire IPv4
   address space is mapped.  It is used for translation of the end
   user's IPv4 address to IPv6 and vice versa according to the algorithm
   defined in section 2.2 of [RFC6052].  This algorithmic mapping has a
   lower precedence than the static mappings.

   The SIIT gateway itself can be either a separate device or a logical
   function in another multi-purpose device, for example an IP router.
   Any number of SIIT gateways may exist simultaneously in an operators
   infrastructure, as long as they all have the same translation prefix
   and list of static mappings configured.

2.1.  DNS Configuration

   The native IPv6 address of the publicly available services should be
   registered in DNS using AAAA records, while the corresponding IPv4
   address (according to the static mapping), should be registered using
   an A record.  This results in the following DNS records:

   www.alice.tld.    IN AAAA  2001:db8:12:34::1
   www.alice.tld.    IN A     198.51.0.2

   mta.bob.tld.      IN AAAA  2001:db8:ab:cd::f
   mta.bob.tld.      IN A     198.51.0.3

   dns.bob.tld.      IN AAAA  2001:db8:12:34::c
   dns.bob.tld.      IN A     198.51.0.1

2.2.  Example Packet Flow

   In this example, "IPv4-only user 2" initiates a request to Alice's
   web server.  He starts by looking up the IPv4 address of
   "www.alice.tld" in DNS, and attempts to connect to this address on
   port 80 by transmitting the following IPv4 packet:

   +-----------------------------------------------+
   | IP Version:           4                       |
   | Source Address:       192.0.2.10              |
   | Destination Address:  198.51.0.2              |
   | Protocol:             TCP                     |
   |-----------------------------------------------|
   | TCP SYN [...]                                 |
   +-----------------------------------------------+

   This packet is then routed over the Internet to the (nearest) SIIT

   gateway, which will translate it into the following IPv6 packet and
   forward it into the IPv6 network:

   +-----------------------------------------------+
   | IP Version:           6                       |
   | Source Address:       2001:db8:46::192.0.2.10 |
   | Destination Address:  2001:db8:12:34::1       |
   | Next Header:          TCP                     |
   |-----------------------------------------------|
   | TCP SYN [...]                                 |
   +-----------------------------------------------+

   The destination address was translated according to the configured
   static mapping, while the source address was translated according to
   the [RFC6052] mapping (because it did not match any static mappings).
   The rest of the IP header was translated according to [RFC6145].  The
   Layer 4 payload is copied verbatim, with the exception of the TCP
   checksum being recalculated.

   Note that the IPv6 address 2001:db8:46::192.0.2.10 may also be
   expressed as 2001:db8:46::c000:20a, cf. section 2.2 of [RFC2373].

   Next, Alice's web server receives this IPv6 packet and responds to it
   like it would with any other IPv6 packet:

   +-----------------------------------------------+
   | IP Version:           6                       |
   | Source Address:       2001:db8:12:34::1       |
   | Destination Address:  2001:db8:46::192.0.2.10 |
   | Next Header:          TCP                     |
   |-----------------------------------------------|
   | TCP SYN+ACK [...]                             |
   +-----------------------------------------------+

   The response packet is routed to the (nearest) SIIT gateway's IPv6
   interface, which will translate it back to IPv4 as follows:

   +-----------------------------------------------+
   | IP Version:           4                       |
   | Source Address:       198.51.0.2              |
   | Destination Address:  192.0.2.10              |
   | Protocol:             TCP                     |
   |-----------------------------------------------|
   | TCP SYN+ACK [...]                             |
   +-----------------------------------------------+

   This time, the source address matched the static mapping, while the
   destination address was translated according to [RFC6052].  The rest

   of the packet was translated according to [RFC6145].

   The resulting IPv4 packet is transmitted back to the end user over
   the IPv4 Internet.  Subsequent packets in the flow will follow the
   exact same translation pattern.  They may or may not cross the same
   translators as earlier packets in the same flow.

   The end user's IPv4 stack has no idea that it is communicating with
   an IPv6 server, nor does the server's IPv6 stack have any idea that
   is is communicating with an IPv4 client.  To them, it's just plain
   IPv4 or IPv6, respectively.  However, the applications running on the
   server may optionally be updated to recognise and strip the
   translation prefix, so that the end user's IPv4 address may be used
   for logging, Geo-Location, abuse handling, and so forth.


3.  Deployment Guidelines for Operators

3.1.  Choice of Application

   As noted in [RFC2663], [RFC2993], and [RFC3022], higher-level
   protocols that embed addresses as part of their payload, will most
   likely not work through any form of address translation, including
   SIIT.  As a general rule, if an application layer protocol does work
   through standard NAT44 (see [RFC3235]), it will most likely work
   through SIIT as well.

   It is recommended that an initial deployment of SIIT is used for
   applications where IPv4-only nodes on the Internet initiate traffic
   towards the IPv6-only services.  While it is possible to combine SIIT
   with DNS64 [RFC6147] or similar mechanisms in order to allow an IPv6-
   only server to initiate communication with IPv4 nodes through an SIIT
   gateway, this may be more complicated to implement, as the server
   must ensure to always use the address statically mapped on the SIIT
   gateway as the source when initiating communication.

   In particular, HTTP [RFC2616] is a good choice of an application
   protocol to start deploying SIIT with, as it is both ubiquitous and
   known to work very well through address translation.

   Note that implementations of SIIT may bundle Application Level
   Gateways (ALGs) to add specific support for certain application
   protocols that would otherwise break, similar to what is commonly
   done with NAT44 implementations.  If ALGs are being used, care must
   be taken to ensure that all the translators in the network all have
   compatible ALGs.

3.2.  Choice of Translation Prefix

   Either a Network-Specific Prefix (NSP) from the provider's own IPv6
   address space or the IANA-allocated Well-Known Prefix 64:ff9b::/96
   (WKP) may be used.  From a technical point of view, both should work
   equally well, however as only a single WKP exists, if a provider
   would like to deploy more than one instance of SIIT in his network,
   or Stateful NAT64 [RFC6146], an NSP must be used anyway for all but
   one of those deployments.

   Furthermore, the WKP cannot be used in inter-domain routing.  By
   using an NSP, a provider will have the possibility to sell SIIT
   service to other operators.

   For these reasons, this document recommends that an NSP is used.
   Section 3.3 of [RFC6052] discusses the choice of translation prefix
   in more detail.

   The prefix may use any of the lengths described in section 2.2 of
   [RFC6052], but /96 has two distinct advantages over the others.
   First, converting it to IPv4 can be done in a single operation by
   simply stripping off the first 96 bits; second, it allows for IPv4
   addresses to be embedded directly into the text representation of an
   IPv6 address using the familiar dotted quad notation, e.g., "2001:
   db8::192.0.2.10" (see section 2.4 of [RFC6052]), instead of being
   converted to hexadecimal notation.  This makes it easier to write
   IPV6 ACLs and similar that match translated endpoints in the IPv4
   Internet.  Use of a /96 prefix length is therefore recommended.

3.3.  Routing Considerations

   The IPv4 service address prefix(es) and the IPv6 translation prefix
   may be routed to the SIIT gateway(s) as any other IPv4 or IPv6 route
   in the provider's network.

   If more than one SIIT gateway is being deployed, it is recommended
   that a dynamic routing protocol (such as BGP, IS-IS, or OSPF) is
   being used to advertise the routes within the provider's network.
   This will ensure that the traffic that is to be translated will reach
   the closest translator, reducing or eliminating traffic trampolines,
   as well as provide high availability - if one translator fails, the
   dynamic routing protocol will automatically redirect the traffic to
   the next-best translator.

3.4.  Location of the Translators

   In order to prevent traffic trampolines, it is optimal to place the
   translators as close as possible to the direct path between the

   servers and the end users.

   Ideally, they are implemented as a logical function within the IP
   routers would handle the traffic anyway (if it wasn't to be
   translated).  This way, the translation service would not need
   separate networks ports to be assigned (which might become saturated
   and impacted the service), nor would it need extra rack space or
   energy.  Some good choices of the location could be within a data
   centre's access routers, or inside the provider's border routers.  If
   every single application in the data centre or the provider's network
   eventually get single-stacked, there would no need to run IPv4 on the
   inside of the translators - thus allowing the operator to reclaim
   IPv4 addresses from the network infrastructure that may instead be
   used for translated services.

3.5.  Migration from Dual Stack

   While this document discusses the use of IPv6-only servers and
   applications, there is no technical requirement that the servers are
   IPv4 free.  SIIT works equally well for a dual stacked servers, which
   makes migration easy - after setting up the translation function, the
   DNS A record for the service is updated to point to the IPv4 address
   that will be translated to IPv6, the previously used IPv4 service
   address may continue to be assigned to the server.  This makes roll-
   back to dual stack easy, as it is only a matter of changing the DNS
   record back to what it was before.

   For high-volume services migrating to SIIT from dual stack, DNS Round
   Robin may be used to gradually migrate the service's IPv4 traffic
   from its native IPv4 address(es) to the translated one(s).

3.6.  Packet Size and Fragmentation Considerations

   There are two key differences between IPv4 and IPv6 relating to
   packet sizes that one should consider when deploying SIIT.  They
   result in a few problematic corner cases, which can be dealt with in
   a few different ways.

   The operator may find that relying on fragmentation in the IPv6
   domain is undesired or even operationally impossible [FRAGDROP].  For
   this reason, the recommendations in this section seeks to minimise
   the use of IPv6 fragmentation.

   Unless otherwise stated, this section assumes that the MTU in both
   the IPv4 and IPv6 domains is 1500 bytes.

Internet-Draft      SIIT in Data Centre Environments       November 2012


3.6.1.  IP Header Size Difference

   The IPv6 header is up to 20 bytes larger than the IPv4 header.  This
   means that a full-size 1500 bytes large IPv4 packet cannot be
   translated to IPv6 without being fragmented, otherwise it would
   likely have resulted in a 1520 bytes large IPv6 packet.

   If the transport protocol used is TCP, this is generally not a
   problem, as the IPv6 server will advertise a TCP MSS of 1440 bytes.
   This causes the client to never send larger packets than what can be
   translated to a single full-size IPv6 packet, eliminating any need
   for fragmentation.

   For other transport protocols, full-size IPv4 packets with the DF
   flag cleared will need to be fragmented by the SIIT gateway.  The
   only way to avoid this is to increase the Path MTU between the SIIT
   gateway and the servers to 1520 bytes.  Note that the servers' MTU
   SHOULD NOT be increased accordingly, as that would cause them to
   undergo Path MTU Discovery for most native IPv6 destinations.
   However, the servers would need to be able to accept and process
   incoming packets larger than their own MTU.  However, if the server's
   IPv6 implementation allows the MTU to be set differently for specific
   destinations, it MAY be increased to 1520 for destinations within the
   translation prefix specifically.

3.6.2.  Minimum Path MTU Difference

   The minimum allowed MTU in IPv6 is 1280 bytes, while no such
   restriction exists in IPv4.  This means that an 1280 byte large IPv6
   packet sent to an IPv4 client may need to be fragmented by a router
   in the IPv4 network.

   By default, an SIIT gateway will set the DF flag when translating
   from IPv6 to IPv4, resulting in a situation where the IPv6 server may
   receive an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big where the indicated MTU value is
   less than the IPv6 minimum of 1280.  In this situation, the IPv6
   server has two choices on how to proceed, according to the last
   paragraph of section 5 of [RFC2460]:

   o  It may reduce its Path MTU value to the value indicated in the
      Packet Too Big. This causes no problems for the SIIT function.

   o  It may reduce its Path MTU value to 1280, and also include a
      Fragmentation header in each subsequent packet sent to that
      destination.  This instructs the SIIT gateway to clear the DF flag
      in the resulting IPv4 packet, and also provides the Identification
      value.

Internet-Draft      SIIT in Data Centre Environments       November 2012


   If the use of the IPv6 Fragmentation header is problematic, and the
   operator has IPv6 servers that implement the second option above, the
   operator should enable a feature on the SIIT gateways which ensures
   that the resulting MTU field is always set to 1280 or higher when
   translating ICMPv4 Need to Fragment into ICMPv6 Packet Too Big, and
   that when translating IPv6 packets smaller or equal to 1280 bytes the
   resulting IPv4 packets will have the DF flag cleared and an
   Identification value generated, cf. Section 4.5.

3.6.3.  "Atomic Fragments"

   By default, an SIIT gateway will include a Fragmentation header in
   the resulting IPv6 packet when translating from an IPv4 packet with
   the DF flag cleared, cf. section 4 of [RFC6145].

   This happens even though the resulting IPv6 packets aren't actually
   fragmented into several pieces, resulting in "Atomic Fragments"
   [ATOMFRAG].  This is generally not useful in a data centre
   environment, and it is therefore recommended that this behaviour is
   disabled at the SIIT gateways.  See Section 4.4.


4.  Implementation Requirements

   [RFC6145] and [RFC6052] specifies the basic SIIT gateway.  However,
   they specify some optional features that are very desirable when
   deploying SIIT in a data centre environment.  This section list which
   additional features are required for an SIIT gateway optimised for a
   data centre environment.

4.1.  Basic Requirements

   The implementation MUST implement [RFC6145] with the algorithmic
   address mapping defined in [RFC6052].  It MUST NOT create any per-
   session state under any circumstance.

4.2.  Static Address Mapping Function

   The implementation MUST allow the operator to configure an arbitrary
   number of static mappings which override the default [RFC6052]
   algorithm.  It SHOULD be possible to specify a single bi-directional
   mapping that will be used in both the IPv4=>IPv6 and IPv6=>IPv4
   directions, but it MAY additionally (or alternatively) support
   unidirectional mappings.

   An example of such a bidirectional static mapping would be:

Internet-Draft      SIIT in Data Centre Environments       November 2012


   o  198.51.0.1 <=> 2001:db8:12:34::c

   To accomplish the same using unidirectional mappings, the following
   two mappings must instead be configured:

   o  198.51.0.1 => 2001:db8:12:34::c

   o  2001:db8:12:34::c => 198.51.0.1

   In both cases, if the gateway receives an IPv6 packet that has 2001:
   db8:12:34::c in either of the source and destination fields of the IP
   header, it MUST rewrite this field to 198.51.0.1 when translating to
   IPv4.  Similarly, if the gateway receives an IPv4 packet that has
   198.51.0.1 as the either the source or destination fields of the IP
   header, it MUST rewrite this field to 2001:db8:12:34::c.  For all
   IPv4 or IPv6 source or destination field values for which there is no
   static mapping, [RFC6052] mapping MUST be used.

4.3.  Support for Increasing the IPv6 Path MTU

   In order to prevent unnecessary use of the IPv6 Fragmentation header,
   the implementation MUST support increasing the IPv6 Path MTU from its
   default value of 1280, as described in section 4 of [RFC6145].

4.4.  Support for Disabling "Atomic Fragments"

   The translator MUST provide a configuration function that allows the
   translator not to include the Fragment Header for non-fragmented IPv6
   packets, cf. section 4 of [RFC6145].

4.5.  Feature for Handling IPv4 Path MTUs Lower than 1260

   In order to prevent unnecessary fragments, the implementation MUST
   support a feature which, if enabled by the operator, changes the
   translator's default behaviour accordingly:

   o  When translating an ICMPv4 Need To Fragment packet indicating a
      Path MTU smaller than or equal to 1260, the MTU field in the
      resulting ICMPv6 Packet Too Big is set to 1280.

   o  When translating an IPv6 packet that is smaller or equal to 1280
      bytes, the DF flag in the resulting IPv4 packet is cleared, and an
      Identification value is generated.  The translator MUST NOT
      generate any state as a result of this.

   This is a modified version of the second approach described in
   section 6 of [RFC6145].  The default state of the feature SHOULD be
   disabled.

   For the definition of an "Atomic Fragment", see [ATOMFRAG].

4.6.  Loop Prevention Mechanism

   As noted in Section 8.2, there is a potential for packets looping
   through the SIIT function if it receives an IPv4 packet for which
   there is no static mapping.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED that the
   implementation has a mechanism that automatically prevents this
   behaviour.  One way this could be accomplished would be to discard
   any IPv4 packets that would be translated into an IPv6 packet that
   would be routed straight back into the SIIT function.

   If such a mechanism isn't provided, the implementation MUST provide a
   way to manually filter or null-route the destination addresses that
   would otherwise cause loops.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This draft makes no request of the IANA.


8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Mistaking the Translation Prefix for a Trusted Network

   If a Network-Specific Prefix from the provider's own address space is
   chosen for the translation prefix, as is recommended, care must be
   taken if the translation service is used in front of services that
   have application-level ACLs that distinguish between the operator's
   own networks and the Internet at large, as the translated IPv4 end
   users on the Internet will appear to come from within the provider's
   own IPv6 address space.  It is therefore important that the
   translation prefix is treated the same as the Internet at large,
   rather than as a trusted network.

Internet-Draft      SIIT in Data Centre Environments       November 2012


8.2.  Packets Looping Through the SIIT Function

   The SIIT gateway receives an IPv4 packet destined to an address for
   which there is no static mapping, its destination address will be
   rewritten according to [RFC6052], making the resulting IPv6 packet
   have a destination address within the translation prefix, which is
   likely routed to back to the SIIT function.  This will cause the
   packet to loop until its Time To Live / Hop Limit reaches zero,
   potentially creating a Denial Of Service vulnerability.

   To avoid this, it should be ensured that packets sent to IPv4
   destinations addresses for which there are no static mappings, or
   whose resulting IPv6 address does not have a more-specific route to
   the IPv6 network, are immediately discarded.
