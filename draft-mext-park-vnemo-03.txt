     Service Differentiation Using Virtualization of Mobile Network
                      draft-mext-park-vnemo-03.txt

Abstract

   A mobile network can be multihomed as described in [RFC4980].  This
   document describes the experimental result of service differentiation
   using multihoming with multiple prefixes.  The multiple prefixes in
   IPv6 NEMO implements multiple virtual mobile networks on a single
   physical NEMO.  The multiple virtual mobile networks provide service
   differentiation on a single mobile network.  Each mobile network node
   inside the mobile network prioritizes for service differenciation.
   It can be differenciated among the virutal mobile networks or
   forwarding traffic from each virtual mobile network to different
   access networks.  In this experiment, a mobile router with multiple
   interfaces can make connection to several access networks
   simultaneoulsly.

1.  Introduction

   Various mobility support mechanism have been supposed, including
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] and NEMO basic support protocol [RFC3963].
   [RFC4980] shows that NEMO achieves benefits from multihoming.  There
   are eight configurations for a multihomed NEMO in [RFC4980], four of
   them are related to a scenario with multiple mobile network prefixes
   (MNPs).

   This document describes the experimental results and and its
   applicability of multihomed NEMO.  This experiment focuses on
   multiple mobile network prefixes (MNPs), and shows the beneifit of
   preference setting to the mobile router and the mobile network, e.g.,
   a choice of interface or access network to transmit the traffic.  The
   implementation takes (1, 1, n) configuration, i.e., single mobile
   router, single home agent, and multiple prefixes, of [RFC4980] that
   the mobile router has multiple interfaces.  With this configuration,
   the mobile router can access different access networks simultaneously
   then the mobile network and the mobile nodes inside it can exploit
   the advantage of each access network,


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Terms used in this draft are defined in [RFC5213], [RFC3963],
   [RFC3775], [MCoA].  In addition or in replacement of these, the
   following terms are defined or redefined:

   Mobile Network

      A mobile network is a network which is composed of a router and
      its subnet nodes, while the router has mobility.

   Mobile Network Node

      A mobile network node is a node connected to the mobile router.  A
      mobile network node is provided with Internet connectivity from a
      mobile router, so even a mobile network moves, a mobile network
      node that is attached to the mobile router is not aware of the
      movement.  A mobile network node can be mobile itself, or fixed
      with the mobile router.

   Virtual Mobile Network

      A virtual mobile network is a logical network that lies on a
      single physical mobile network.  Several virtual mobile network
      can be exist on a single physical mobile network.  Every virtual
      mobile network includes the mobile router and all or some of the
      mobile network nodes.


3.  Virtualization on a mobile network

   Virtualization is a term that refers to a technique for abstraction
   of physical resource to provide it to one or more users.  One single
   resource can be seen as several virtual resources to multiple users,
   or several physical resources can be seen as a single virtual
   resource to a user.  For a network, various types of virtualization
   can be exist according to the layer that is virtualized.
   Virtualization at lower layer, PHY or MAC, is implemented using
   various multiplexing or multiple access mechanisms to support
   multiple users that shares a single resource, like a link or radio
   spectrum.

   In this document we consider virtualization at the network layer.  In
   IPv6 networks, a virtual mobile can be implemented by using multiple
   mobile network prefixes in a single NEMO.  Parts of a mobile network,
   e.g., a mobile router itself and one or more mobile network nodes,
   organize a virtual mobile network while the mobile router and other
   mobile network nodes compose another virtual mobile network in the
   same NEMO.  An analysis about scenarios for NEMO with multiple mobile
   network prefixes is described in [RFC4980].  According to [RFC4980],
   multiple mobile network prefixes configuration can give beneifit of
   preference setting to the mobile network nodes.

   Each virtual mobile network is distinguished by mobile network prefix
   that the virtual mobile network uses.  A mobile router sets up
   multiple mobile network prefixes for the virtual mobile networks.  A
   mobile network node selects one of the mobile network prefixes
   advertised by the mobile router.


4.  Differentiation Using Virtual Mobile Network

   Service differentiation for mobile network can be implemented with
   following scenarios of virtual mobile networking.

4.1.  Service Scenario for Single Access Network

   A mobile router generates several mobile network prefixes to organize
   multiple virtual mobile networks.  Each virtual mobile network
   corrsponds to a priority class of each mobile network node.  The
   selection of a specific virtual mobile network among the virtual
   mobile networks for a mobile network node is negotiated when the
   mobile network node attahces to the mobile router.  When a mobile
   network node sends traffic to the Internet, the mobile router
   regulates the traffic according to the priority of the virtual mobile
   network in which the mobile network joined.

4.2.  Service Scenario for Multiple Access Networks

   In the case that the mobile router has several interfaces that are
   connected to multiple access networks, characteristic of each access
   network can be used for service differentiation of virtual mobile
   networks.  A mobile router generates new mobile network prefix when
   it attaches to a new access network.  Each mobile network prefix
   forms a new virtual mobile network, while the mobile network prefix
   also connected to a specific access network.  The mapping information
   between the mobile network prefix and the access network is stored in
   the mobile router.

   When a mobile network node joins to the mobile network, it notifies
   its requirement for an access network to the mobile router.  The
   requirement can be traffic classification, like BE, Voice, or Video,
   or the network requirement can be specified by some parameters like
   bandwidth, packet loss rate, or latency.  According to the
   requirement, the mobile network selects an appropriate virtual mobile
   network, i.e. the mobile network prefix, that is connected to one of
   the access networks.  With the selected mobile network prefix, the

   mobile network node can configure its network address, and joins to
   the virtual mobile network.  Traffic from the mobile network node
   destined to the Internet is classified at the mobile router and
   forwarded to the access network connected to the virtual mobile
   network prefix.

   The scenario can be combined with lower layer network resource
   virtualization.  When a lower layer virtual network is organized and
   isolated from the other virtual networks for special service
   provision, the proposed scenario can provide the mechanism of
   classification.

4.3.  Service Scenario for Multiple Access Networks

   In the case that the mobile router deploys one or more caches and
   allows one or more prioritized virtual mobile networks to use the
   caches, it can provide specific service.  For example, one virtual
   mobile network is allowed to use the mobile router cache for
   accelerating large volume of content networking and another virtual
   mobile network does not use the mobile router cache.


5.  Security Considerations

   We do not consider any security issues in this draft.
