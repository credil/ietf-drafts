Abstract

   Some of the messages defined by a potential MIF API may rely on
   functionalties provided by lower layers.  The IEEE 802.21
   specification defines an abstraction of lower layer functions that
   can be useful for the MIF API.  This document provides an overview of
   the 802.21 specification and enumerates a subset of functions that
   can be used in the context of the MIF API to interact with lower
   layers.

Internet-Draft            IEEE 802.21 Overview               August 2013


1.  Introduction

   There is currently a need to present a coherent connection management
   behaviour for different terminal platforms (e.g. mobile phones, PCs,
   tablets, etc.), as users often experience a very different behaviour
   when connecting with various platforms to the same networks and for
   the same purposes (e.g. web browsing, email access, dedicated
   applications, etc.).

   The IEEE 802.21 specification [IEEE802.21] defines several media
   independent services that can be used by higher layers (e.g., L3 and
   above) to interact with lower layers (e.g., L2 and below).  This
   document provides an overview of the IEEE 802.21 specification,
   focusing on the relevant functions from a MIF API point of view.

2.  IEEE 802.21 Framework

   Some of the connection management services described in
   [I-D.seite-mif-cm] may rely on standardized abstraction layers such
   as the IEEE 802.21 framework [IEEE802.21].

   The IEEE 802.21-2008 Media Independent Handover (MIH) Services
   baseline specification defines three type of services: Information
   Services (IS), Event Services (ES) and Command Services (CS).  Each
   one of these services has a different purpose.  The IS provides
   information about existing networks and services in a potential
   target network.  The ES provides triggers, measurements and events
   from lower layers (e.g. network access layers) that can be used for
   instance to proactively trigger actions like a handing over or
   establishing connection to a new network.  The CS allows configuring
   lower layer interfaces and events.  Both ES and CS provide an
   abstraction layer to upper layers that allows configuring and
   interacting with different types of network link interfaces in a
   coherent manner.

   In 802.21 teminology, the 802.21 functionalities are perfomed by the
   MIH Function.  This MIH Function is in charge of providing services
   to the MIH User, which is a higher layer entity (e.g., L3 and above).
   Functions are applied to specific Link Layers, which are lower layer
   entities (e.g., L2 and below).  The basics of the 802.21 ES/CS flow
   are depicted in Figure 1.
