Internet-Draft            RTCP XR Jitter Buffer             January 2013


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Jitter Buffer Metrics Block

   This document defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The new block type provides information on jitter buffer
   configuration and performance.

   The metric belongs to the class of transport-related end system
   metrics defined in [RFC6792].

   Instances of this Metrics Block refer by Synchronization source
   (SSRC) to the separate auxiliary Measurement Information block
   [RFC6776] which contains information such as the SSRC of the measured
   stream, and RTP sequence numbers and time intervals indicating the
   span of the report.

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defines an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block for
   use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   Monitoring Architectures [RFC6792] provides guideline for reporting
   block format using RTCP XR.  Metrics described in this draft are in
   accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6390]and [RFC6792].

1.4.  Applicability

   Real-time applications employ a jitter buffer to absorb jitter
   introduced on the path from source to destination.  These metrics are
   used to report how the jitter buffer at the receiving end of RTP
   stream behaves as a result of jitter in the network and are
   applicable to a range of RTP applications.

   These metrics reflect how terminal-related factors affect real-time
   application quality and are useful to provide better end-user quality
   of experience (QoE).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Jitter Buffer Metrics Block

   This block describes the configuration and operating parameters of
   the jitter buffer in the receiver of the RTP end system or RTP mixer
   which sends the report.  Instances of this Metrics Block refer by
   SSRC to the separate auxiliary Measurement Information block
   [RFC6776] which describes the measurement interval in use.  This
   Metrics Block relies on the measurement interval in the Measurement
   Information block indicating the span of the report and should be
   sent in the same compound RTCP packet as the measurement information
   block.  If the measurement interval is not received in the same
   compound RTCP packet as this Metrics Block, this Metrics Block should
   be discarded.

3.2.  Definition of Fields in Jitter Buffer Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Jitter Buffer Metrics Report Block is identified by the constant
      NJB.

      [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NJB with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]


   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits

      This field is used to indicate whether the Jitter Buffer metrics
      are Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics:




Clark, et al.             Expires July 14, 2013                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            RTCP XR Jitter Buffer             January 2013


         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
         most recent measurement interval duration between successive
         metrics reports.

         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
         accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.

         I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled
         instantaneous value.


   Jitter Buffer Configuration (C): 1 bit

      This field is used to identify the jitter buffer method in use at
      the receiver, according to the following code:



            0 = Fixed jitter buffer

            1 = Adaptive jitter buffer


   Reserved (Rsvd.): 5 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders
      ignored by receivers (See [RFC6709] section 4.2).


   Block Length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one, in
      accordance with the definition in [RFC3611].  This field MUST be
      set to 3 to match the fixed length of the report block.


   jitter buffer nominal delay (JB nominal): 16 bits

      This is the current nominal jitter buffer delay in milliseconds,
      which corresponds to the nominal jitter buffer delay for packets
      that arrive exactly on time.  It is calculated based on the
      difference between the receipt time and the playout time for the
      packet that arrives exactly on time.  This parameter MUST be
      provided for both fixed and adaptive jitter buffer
      implementations.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the

Internet-Draft            RTCP XR Jitter Buffer             January 2013


      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.


   jitter buffer maximum delay (JB maximum): 16 bits

      This is the current maximum jitter buffer delay in milliseconds
      which corresponds to the earliest arriving packet that would not
      be discarded.  It is calculated based on the difference between
      the receipt time and the playout time for the earliest arriving
      packet.  In simple queue implementations this may correspond to
      the size of the jitter buffer.  In adaptive jitter buffer
      implementations, this value may vary dynamically from JB low water
      mark to JB high water mark (See below).  This parameter MUST be
      provided for both fixed and adaptive jitter buffer
      implementations.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.


   jitter buffer high water mark (JB high water mark): 16 bits

      This is the highest value of the jitter buffer nominal delay in
      milliseconds which occurred at any time during the reporting
      interval.  This parameter MUST be provided for adaptive jitter
      buffer implementations and its value MUST be set to JB maximum for
      fixed jitter buffer implementations.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.


   jitter buffer low water mark (JB low water mark): 16 bits

      This is the lowest value of the jitter buffer nominal delay in
      milliseconds which occurred at any time during the reporting
      interval.  This parameter MUST be provided for adaptive jitter
      buffer implementations and its value MUST be set to JB maximum for
      fixed jitter buffer implementations.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.

4.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  However XR blocks MAY
   be used without prior signaling (see section 5 of RFC3611).

4.1.  SDP rtcp-xr-attrib Attribute Extension

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   xr-format =/ xr-jb-block

   xr-jb-block = "jitter-bfr"

4.2.  Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in offer-answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [RFC3611] for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters
   applies.  For detailed usage of Offer/Answer for unilateral
   parameter, refer to section 5.2 of [RFC3611].

Internet-Draft            RTCP XR Jitter Buffer             January 2013


5.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

5.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value NJB in the IANA "RTCP XR
   Block Type Registry" to the "JB Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NJB with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

5.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "jitter-bfr" in the
   "RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry".

5.3.  Contact information for registrations


      The contact information for the registrations is:

6.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
