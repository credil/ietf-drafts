    <abstract>
      <t>Given the global lack of available IPv4 space, and limitations in
      IPv4 extension and transition technologies, this document advises that
      IPv6 support is no longer considered optional. It also cautions that
      there are places in existing IETF documents where the term "IP" is used
      in a way that could be misunderstood by implementers as the term "IP"
      becomes a generic which can mean IPv4 + IPv6, IPv6-only, or IPv4-only,
      depending on context and application.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IP version 4 (IPv4) has served to connect public and private hosts
      all over the world for over 30 years. However, due to the success of the
      Internet in finding new and innovative uses for IP networking, billions
      of hosts are now connected via the Internet and requiring unique
      addressing. This demand has led to the exhaustion of the IANA global
      pool of unique IPv4 addresses <xref target="IANA-exhaust"></xref>, and
      will be followed by the exhaustion of the free pools for each Regional
      Internet Registry (RIR), the first of which is APNIC <xref
      target="APNIC-exhaust"></xref>. While transition technologies and other
      means to extend the lifespan of IPv4 do exist, nearly all of them come
      with tradeoffs that prevent them from being optimal long-term solutions
      when compared with deployment of IP version 6 (IPv6) as a means to allow
      continued growth on the Internet. See <xref target="RFC6269"></xref> and
      <xref target="I-D.donley-nat444-impacts"></xref> for some discussion on
      this topic.</t>

      <t>IPv6 <xref target="RFC1883"></xref> was proposed in 1995 as, among
      other things, a solution to the limitations on globally unique
      addressing that IPv4's 32-bit addressing space represented, and has been
      under continuous refinement (e.g., <xref target="RFC2460"></xref>) and
      deployment ever since. The exhaustion of IPv4 and the continued growth
      of the internet worldwide has created the driver for widespread IPv6
      deployment.</t>

      <t>However, the IPv6 deployment necessary to reduce reliance on IPv4 has
      been hampered by a lack of ubiquitous hardware and software support
      throughout the industry. Many vendors, especially in the consumer space
      have continued to view IPv6 support as optional. Even today they are
      still selling "IP capable" or "Internet Capable" devices which are not
      IPv6-capable, which has continued to push out the point at which the
      natural hardware refresh cycle will significantly increase IPv6 support
      in the average home or enterprise network. They are also choosing not to
      update existing software to enable IPv6 support on software-updatable
      devices, which is a problem because it is not realistic to expect that
      the hardware refresh cycle will single-handedly purge IPv4-only devices
      from the active network in a reasonable amount of time. This is a
      significant problem, especially in the consumer space, where the network
      operator often has no control over the hardware the consumer chooses to
      use. For the same reason that the average consumer is not making a
      purchasing decision based on the presence of IPv6 support in their
      Internet-capable devices and services, consumers are unlikely to replace
      their still-functional Internet-capable devices simply to add IPv6
      support - they don't know or don't care about IPv6, they simply want
      their devices to work as advertised.</t>

      <t>This lack of support is making the eventual IPv6 transition
      considerably more difficult, and drives the need for expensive and
      complicated transition technologies to extend the life of IPv4-only
      devices as well as eventually to interwork IPv4-only and IPv6-only
      hosts. While IPv4 is expected to coexist on the Internet with IPv6 for
      many years, a transition from IPv4 as the dominant Internet Protocol
      towards IPv6 as the dominant Internet Protocol will need to occur. The
      sooner the majority of devices support IPv6, the less protracted this
      transition period will be.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="simple_list" title="Clarifications and Recommendation">
      <t>To ensure interoperability and proper function after IPv4 exhaustion,
      support for IPv6 is virtually a requirement. Rather than update the
      existing IPv4 protocol specification standards to include IPv6, IETF has
      defined a completely separate set of standalone documents which cover
      IPv6. Therefore, implementers are cautioned that a distinction must be
      made between IPv4 and IPv6 in some IETF documents where IP is used
      generically. Current requirements for IPv6 support can be found in <xref
      target="RFC4294"></xref>, soon to be updated by <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-6man-node-req-bis"></xref> and in <xref
      target="RFC6204"></xref>. Each of these documents contains specific
      information, requirements, and references to other draft and proposed
      standards governing many aspects of IPv6 implementation.</t>

      <t>Many of IETF's early documents use the generic term "IP" synonymously
      with the more specific "IPv4." Some examples of this potential confusion
      can be found in <xref target="RFC1812"></xref>, especially sections 1,
      2, and 4. Since RFC1812 is an IPv4 router specification, the generic use
      of IP in this standard may cause confusion as the term "IP" can now be
      interpreted to mean: IPv4 + IPv6, IPv6-only, or IPv4-only. Additionally,
      <xref target="RFC1122"></xref>, is no longer a complete definition of
      "IP" or the Internet Protocol suite by itself, because it does not
      include IPv6. For example, section 3.1 does not contain references to
      the IPv6 equivalent standards for the Internet layer, section 3.2 is a
      protocol walk-through for IPv4 only, and section 3.2.1.1 explicitly
      requires an IP datagram whose version number is not 4 to be discarded,
      which would be detrimental to IPv6 forwarding. Additional instances of
      this type of problem exist that are not discussed here. Since existing
      RFCs say "IP" in places where they may mean IPv4, implementers are
      cautioned to ensure that they know whether a given standard is inclusive
      or exclusive of IPv6. To ensure interoperability, implementers building
      IP nodes will need to support both IPv4 and IPv6. If the standard does
      not include an integral definition of both IPv4 and IPv6, implementers
      need to use the other informative references in this document as a
      companion guideline for proper IPv6 implementations.</t>

      <t>To ensure interoperability and flexibility, the best practice is:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>New IP implementations must support IPv6.</t>

          <t>Updates to current IP implementations should support IPv6.</t>

          <t>IPv6 support must be equivalent or better in quality and
          functionality when compared to IPv4 support in a new or updated IP
          implementation.</t>

          <t>New and updated IP Networking implementations should support IPv4
          and IPv6 coexistence (dual-stack), but must not require IPv4 for
          proper and complete function.</t>

          <t>Implementers are encouraged to update existing hardware and
          software to enable IPv6 wherever technically feasible.</t>
