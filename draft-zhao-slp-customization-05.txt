This document defines two extensions (Select and Sort)
for the Service Location Protocol (SLP).  These extensions allow a
User Agent (UA) to request that the Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
entries in a Service Reply (SrvRply) be limited to the specified
number, or be sorted according to the specified sort key list.  Using
these two extensions together can facilitate discovering the best
match, such as finding a service that has the maximum speed or the
minimum load.
