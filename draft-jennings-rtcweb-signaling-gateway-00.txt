           SIP to RTCWeb Offer/Answer Protocol (ROAP) Gateway
               draft-jennings-rtcweb-signaling-gateway-00

Abstract

   This document proposes behavior of a RTCWeb signaling gateway for
   mapping message representations between RTCWeb Offer/Answer Protocol
   (ROAP) scheme and native SIP messaging scheme.  Such a signaling
   gateway is intended to translate to and from/SIP for enabling use
   cases between a RTCWeb enabled browser and legacy SIP devices.

Internet-Draft                  SIP2ROAP                    October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This specification suggests one possible way to build a RTCWeb
   Signaling gateway that maps message representations proposed in
   [ROAP] to native SIP [RFC3261] messages and vice-versa.  The
   specification [ROAP] describes a signaling protocol for RTCWeb to
   support negotiation of media session using SDP offer/answer [RFC3264]
   protocol.  Such a signaling protocol enables an RTCWeb browser to
   setup media sessions to another browser or a SIP device.  For
   Browser-to-SIP device use case, the signaling gateway connects to
   legacy SIP devices and SHALL translate messages between ROAP and SIP
   native messages schemes.


2.  Mapping to SIP

   Note:  The SDP and SIP examples are not correct but illustrate the
      rough outline of the mechanism.  Future version will correct this.


   The design requires the gateway to be SIP transaction statefull but
   does not require any storage of longer term state.  The information
   that remains constant over the SIP dialog is stored in session tokens
   while the information that is needed to from a SIP response is stored
   in response tokens.  The gateway appears as a SIP UA to the sip side.
   Message on the two sides of the signalling gateway are referred to as
   the SIP side and web side.

   The following sub-sections show example message flows with detailed
   message description of native SIP messages that are mapped from ROAP
   scheme and the ones that are received as responses by the signaling
   gateway.  CallerUA(callerua@atlanta.example.com) is a RTCWeb browser.
   CalleeUA(sip:calleeua@sippy.example.com) is assumed to be a SIP-
   enabled device.  It is also assumed that CalleeUA has registered with
   a SIP proxy server to be able to receive the calls via the proxy.

2.1.  SuccessFull Session Establishment

   In this scenario CallerUA establishes successful media session with
   CalleeUA, a legacy SIP end-point, with the help of the RTCWeb
   signaling gateway.

   On receipt of SIP:INVITE with SDP for video, the signaling gateway
   maps SIP:INVITE to ROAP:OFFER(section 5.3.1 of ROAP[ROAP]) and sends
   it to CallerUA indicating the intent.

   CallerUA accepts the new ROAP:OFFER(section 5.3.1 of ROAP[ROAP]) and
   sends ROAP:ANSWER section 5.3.2 of ROAP[ROAP]).

   The signaling gateway maps the ROAP:ANSWER to SIP:200 to be sent to

   CalleeUA accepts the receipt of SIP:200 by sending SIP:ACK.  The
   signaling gateway SIP:ACK to ROAP:OK (section 5.3.2 of ROAP[ROAP])
   sends it to CallerUA.  This completes adding the new media (video) to
   the existing session.

   This message SHALL be converted to ROAP:OK(section 5.3.2 of
   ROAP[ROAP]) and sent to caller by the signaling gateway.

3.  Handling SIP Requests

   When the signalling gateway receives a SIP request, the gateway forms
   the message on the web request side in the following way:
   1.  The SIP methods INVITE, ACK, BYE, CANCEL are mapped to
       messageType OFFER, OK, SHUTDOWN, SHUTDOWN respectively
   2.  The Seq on web side is formed from the numeric portion of CSeq
       header field value from the SIP side.

Internet-Draft                  SIP2ROAP                    October 2011


   3.  The offererSessionId is formed by a JSON object string that has
       an call-id attribute containing the SIP call-id header field
       value and a from-tag attribute containing the SIP from-tag.
   4.  If there is a SIP to-tag, it is used for the answererSessionId.
   5.  If there is a SIP body containing SDP, it is copied into the SDP
       parameter on web side.
   6.  The setSessionToken is formed by a JSON object string that has
       contact attribute that contains the SIP contact header field
       value and an route attribute which is an array that has the
       values of the SIP route header field values in reverse order.
   7.  The setResponseToken formed by a JSON object string that has via
       attribute that is an array containing the SIP via headers field
       values.  The JSON object also includes an attribute that holds
       the request method.  The gateway MAY include any other SIP
       headers in an attribute named headers which is an array with one
       header field in each entry.


4.  Handling SIP Responses

   When the signalling gateway receives a SIP response, the gateway
   forms the message on the web request side in the following way:
   1.  The SIP responses 180 is mapped to ANSWER with more_coming.  A
       200 response that contains SDP is mapped to ANSWER. 481 is mapped
       to NOMATCH. 408 is mapped to TIMEOUT. 486 is mapped to REFUSED.
       491 is mapped to CONFLICT.  All other SIP 3xx to 6xx responses
       are mapped to FAILED.
   2.  The Seq on web side is formed from the numeric portion of CSeq
       header field value from the SIP side.
   3.  The offererSessionId is formed by a JSON object string that has
       an call-id attribute containing the SIP call-id header field
       value and a from-tag attribute containing the SIP from-tag.
   4.  The SIP to-tag is used for the answererSessionId.
   5.  If there is a SIP body containing SDP, it is copied into the SDP
       parameter on web side.
   6.  The setSessionToken is formed by a JSON object string that has
       contact attribute that contains the SIP contact header field
       value and an route attribute which is an array that has the
       values of the SIP route header field values.
   7.  The setResponseToken formed by a JSON object string that has via
       attribute that is an array containing the SIP via headers field
       values.  The gateway MAY include any other SIP headers in an
       attribute named headers which is an array with one header field
       in each entry.

5.  Handling Web Messages

   When the signalling gateway receives a WEB message, the gateway forms
   the message on the SIP side in the following way:
   1.   The messageType OFFER, ANSWER with more_coming, ANSWER, OK,
        NOMATCH, TIMEOUT, REFUSED, CONFLICT, FAILED are mapped to
        INVITE, 180, 200, ACK, 481, 408, 486, 491, 500 respectively.
   2.   The messageType SHUTDOWN is mapped to a CANCEL if the
        answererSessionId is empty and to BYE otherwise
   3.   For SIP responses, The numeric portion of the CSeq is formed by
        taking the number portion from the Seq field.  If the
        setResponseToken contains a method name, that is used for the
        method portion of the CSeq otherwise if it does not exist, the
        request method of the SIP message is used.
   4.   The Call-ID header field values is formed from the call-id
        attribute of the offererSessionId.
   5.   The from-tag is formed from the from-tag attribute of the
        offererSessionId.
   6.   If there is a answererSessionId, it is used for the SIP to-tag.
   7.   If there is a SDP parameter, it is used as a SIP SDP body and
        the content type of and content length headers are set
        appropriately.
   8.   If there is a sessionToken that contains a contact attribute, it
        is used to form the SIP contact header field value.
   9.   If there is a sessionToken that contains a route array, it is
        used to form the SIP route header field values.
   10.  If there is a responseToken that contains a via array, it is
        used to form the SIP via header field values.


6.  Limitations

   The following things, if used on the SIP side, will not interoperate:

   o  Redirection via 3xx
   o  UPDATE / PRACK
   o  REFER
   o  SIP to pre RFC 3261 devices that don't support to and from tags.
   o  SUB/NOTify
   o  SIP INVITES that do not contain an SDP offer
   o  SIP extensions to RFC 3261.


7.  Security Considerations

   TBD
