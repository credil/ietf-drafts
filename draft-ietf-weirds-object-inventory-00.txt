1.  Introduction

   Internet registries for both number resources and names have
   historically maintained a lookup service to permit public access to
   some portion of the registry database.  Most registries offer the
   service via the WHOIS protocol [RFC3912], with additional services
   being offered via world wide web pages, bulk downloads, and other
   services, such as RPSL [RFC2622].

   Although the WHOIS protocol specified in [RFC3912] is widely adopted
   and supported, it has several shortcomings that limits its usefulness
   to the evolving needs of the Internet community.  For example, the
   WHOIS protocol has not been Internationalized, it does not
   consistently support Internationalized Domain Name (IDN, described in
   [RFC5890]); WHOIS has no query and response format; and WHOIS
   protocol does not support user authentication, access control for
   differentiated access.

   This document is aimed to build an object inventory to facilitate
   discussions of domain name data objects in WHOIS response.  Based on
   this statistics result, it may help to form and specify the response
   format.

   In domain name space, there are now over 200 ccTLDs and 21 gTLDs.
   Different domain name registries may have different WHOIS response
   objects and formats.  A common understanding of domain name data
   format is critical.

   This document describes the WHOIS data collection procedures and
   gives a data object inventory analysis based on the collected data
   from 106 ccTLDs and 18 gTLDs.  The statistics result includes port 43
   response data and web response data.  All the data objects are
   classified into domain, contact, nameserver and registrar related
   objects.  Other objects that do not belong to above four categories
   are viewed as private designed objects.

   Since this is a document with statistics analysis and there are no
   protocol specifications, the [RFC2119] language does not apply.


2.  Methodology

   WHOIS information, including port 43 response and web response data,
   is collected following the procedures descibed below.

   (1)  A programming script is applied to collect port 43 response data
        from 294 ccTLDs. "nic.ccTLD" is used as the query string which
        is usually registered in a domain registry.  Responses of 106
        ccTLDs were received. 18 gTLDs' port 43 response data is
        collected from their contracts with ICANN.  So the sample size
        of port 43 WHOIS response data is 124 registries in total.

   (2)  WHOIS data from web is collected manually from the 124
        registries that have port 43 WHOIS responses.

   (3)  Some of the responses which are collected by program may not
        seem to be correct.  So data of top 10 ccTLD registries, like
        .de, .eu and .uk etc., was re-verified by querying domain names
        other than "nic.ccTLD".

   (4)  In accordance with the specification 4 of new gTLD applicant
        guide book, [RFC5730], [RFC5731], [RFC5732] and [RFC5733], the
        response data objects are classified into public and other data
        objects.  Public data objects are those which are defined in the
        above two documents.  Other objects are those which are self
        designed data elements or objects in different registries.

   (5)  Data elements with the same meaning, but using different labels,
        are grouped together.  The numbers of registries that support
        the data elements is calculated in the total count column.


3.  Terminology

   o  Data element -- The name of specific response object.

   o  Label -- Different registries may have different naming ways for
      the same data element.  So there may be several labels with the
      same meaning and belong to one group of data element.

   o  Most popular label -- The label which is most supported by the
      registries.

   o  Number of labels -- The number of different labels.

   o  Total count -- The number of registries that support a certain
      data element.

4.1.  Overview

   WHOIS data is collected from 124 registries, including 106 ccTLDs and
   18 gTLDs.  All the 124 registries support domain query.  Among 124
   registries, 8 ccTLDs and 15 gTLDs support contact query. 10 ccTLDs
   and 18 gTLDs support name server query. 4 ccTLDs and 18 gTLDs support
   registrar query.  Domain WHOIS data contains 68 data elements that
   use a total of 550 labels.  There are total 392 other objects for
   Domain WHOIS data.  The raw data can be accessed with the following
   link: WHOIS Statistcs Data File [Stat-Data-File]

4.2.  Public Objects

   As mentioned above, public objects are those data elements selected
   according to new gTLD application guide book, [RFC5730], [RFC5731],
   [RFC5732] and [RFC5733].  They are generally classified into four
   categories: domain, contact, nameserver and registrar related
   information.

4.2.1.  WHOIS Data of Domain

   WHOIS data of domain includes "Domain Name", "Creation Date", "Domain
   Status", "Expiration Date", "Updated Date", "Domain ID", "DNSSEC" and
   "Last Transferred Date".  The following table gives the element name,
   most popular label and corresponding numbers of TLDs and labels.

   +-------------------+-------------------+------------+--------------+

                           WHOIS Data of Domain

   Analyzing the above data, about 95.16% of the 124 registries support
   "Domain Name" data element; 85.48% of the 124 registries support
   "Creation Date" data element; 76.61% of the 124 registries support
   "Domain Status" data element.  On the other hand, some elements such
   as "DNSSEC" and "Last Transferred Date" are only supported by 11.29%

                           Top 50 Other Objects

   Some elements like "Registrant" are difficult to be classified into
   any categories.  A few registries have two levels of data elements,
   for example:


         Registrant:
           Name:
           Email:
           ...


   We do not think the first level of elements belong to any part.  So
   they are put into the scope of other objects.

   Some other data elements, like "Remarks", "anniversary" and "Customer
   service Contact" etc., are designed particularly for their own
   purpose by different registries.


5.  Conclusion

5.1.  Preleminary Statistics

   Some preliminary statistics conclusion could be drawn from the raw
   data.

   o  All of the 124 domain registries have the oject names in their
      responses although they are in various fomats.

   o  Of the 118 whois services contacted, 65 registries show their
      registrant contact.  About half of the registries (60 registries)
      support admin contact information.  There are 47 registries, that
      is about one third of the total number, have technical and billing
      contact information.  And only 7 of all the 124 registries give
      their abuse email in remarks part.  No explicite abuse contact
      information is provided.  The

   o  There are mainly two presentation formats.  One is key:value, the
      other is data block format.  Example of key-value format:

                           Top 10 Data Elements

   Most of the domain related WHOIS information is included in the top
   10 data elements.  Other information like name server and registrar
   name are also supported by most registries.

   We did a cumulative distribution analysis of all the data elements.

   (1)  About 5% of data elements are supported by over 111 (90%)
        registries.

   (2)  About 30% of data elements are supported by over 44 (35%)
        registries.

   (3)  About 60% of data elements are supported by over 32 (26%)
        registries.

   (4)  About 90% of data elements are supported by over 14 (11%)
        registries.

   From the above result, we can conclude that only a few registries
   support all the public objects, most of the registries support just
   parts of all the objects.

                               Top 10 Labels

   As explained above, name server label is a unique example that many
   registries define the name server elements from "nameserver 1" till
   "nameserver n".  So label numbers of name server are much more than
   other elements.  Other elements about date, street name have more
   labels.

   A cumulative distribution analysis of label numbers was done.  About
   90% of data elements have more than 2 Labels.  So it is very
   necessary to specify a standard and unified format for object names
   of WHOIS response.

5.4.  Other Objects Analysis

   According to statistics result, there are 392 other data objects in
   total that are not easy to be classsified or privately owned by
   various registries.  Top 50 other objects are listed in the table in
   section 4.3.  You can find that various different objects are
   designed for some particular purpose.  So in order to ensure
   uniqueness of JSON names used in the Restful Whois service,
   establishing an IANA registry is a necessary requirement.


6.  Limitation

   o  The input "nic.ccTLD" maybe is not a good choice.

   o  The classification of local script data elements may not be
      accurate. 11 registries give local script responses.

   o  The extension data elements are used randomly by different
      registries.  It is difficult to do statistical analysis.

   o  Sample sizes of contact, name server and registrar queries are
      small.

      *  We only use "Whois contactID/nameserver/registrar" as the query
         commands to check.

      *  Some registries may not support contact, name server or
         registrar queries.

      *  Some may not support query contact by ID.

      *  Contact information of some registries may be protected.
