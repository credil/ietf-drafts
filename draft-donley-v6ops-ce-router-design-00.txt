1.  Introduction

   This document descrbes design considerations for IPv6 customer edge
   (CE) routers designed for residential/small business use
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-6204bis].  These routers may also support IPv4 and
   potentially one/more transition technologies.  These design
   considerations are crafted to ensure a safe and orderly transition to
   IPv6 while maintaining a quality IP connection to the customer
   premise.


2.  Design Considerations

   There are two overriding goals for CE routers:

   o  Offer customers the best possible quality of experience.

   o  Do not unnecessarily overwhelm ISP resources.

2.1.  Address acquisition

   The IPv6 CE router needs to support connectivity to one or more
   access network architectures.  There are generally three IPv6 address
   acquisition mechanisms in widespread use today:

   o  stateful DHCPv6 [RFC3315]

   o  Stateless Address Autoconfiguraton (SLAAC)[RFC4862]

   o  unnumbered

   Design considerations for address acquisition:

   1.  IPv6 CE routers should support one or more of the above address
       acquisition mechanisms.

   2.  Only one address acquisition mechanism should be used for a given
       protocol (e.g. native IPv4/IPv6) at a given time.

   3.  Not all access architectures support all address acquisition
       mechanisms.  When attached to access networks that do not support
       certain address acquisition mechanisms, the CE router should not
       attempt to use unsupported addressing mechanisms, if it is
       possible to identify such a limitation.

   4.  The CE router should attempt address acquisition gracefully.  It
       should not overwhelm service provider provisioning servers.

   5.  If a Service Provider sends a hint to the CE router as to which
       addressing mechanism to use, the CE router should honor the hint.

2.2.  Transition technologies

   CE routers should support technologies for providing ipv4 access over
   IPv6 networks and IPv6 access over IPv4 networks.  While the IETF has
   defined a large number of such protocols, the CE router need not
   implement all of them.  In particular, it should implement those
   technologies required by ISPs.  At the time of this writing, such
   technologies include:

   o  Native Dual-Stack

   o  IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6RD) [RFC5969]

   o  Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite)[RFC6333]

   Design considerations for transition technologies:

   1.  Native IPv4/IPv6 service should be preferred over tunneled
       service.

   2.  Avoid NAT, when possible.  [I-D.donley-nat444-impacts]

   3.  While multihoming (supporting both native/tunneled service for a
       given protocol) may be a valid approach, it need not be
       supported.  Singlehoming should also be considered a valid
       approach.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


4.  Security Considerations

   TBD
