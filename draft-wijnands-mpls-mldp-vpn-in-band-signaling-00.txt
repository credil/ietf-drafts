                 Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol
                   In-Band Signaling in a VPN Context
           draft-wijnands-mpls-mldp-vpn-in-band-signaling-00

Abstract

   Sometimes an IP multicast distribution tree (MDT) traverses both
   MPLS-enabled and non-MPLS-enabled regions of a network.  Typically
   the MDT begins and ends in non-MPLS regions, but travels through an
   MPLS region.  In such cases, it can be useful to begin building the
   MDT as a pure IP MDT, then convert it to an MPLS Multipoint LSP
   (Label Switched Path) when it enters an MPLS-enabled region, and then
   convert it back to a pure IP MDT when it enters a non-MPLS-enabled
   region.  [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-in-band-signaling] specifies the
   procedures for building such a hybrid MDT, using Protocol Independent
   Multicast (PIM) as the control protocol in the non-MPLS region of the
   network, and using Multipoint Extensions to Label Distribution
   Protocol (mLDP) in the MPLS region.  This document extends those
   procedures so that they will work when the links between the MPLS and
   non-MPLS regions are [RFC4364] interfaces.  While these procedures do
   not provide a good general multicast VPN solution, they are useful in
   certain specific situations.

Internet-Draft    mLDP In-band Signaling in VPN Context     October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Sometimes an IP multicast distribution tree (MDT) traverses both
   MPLS-enabled and non-MPLS-enabled regions of a network.  In such
   cases, it can be useful to begin building the MDT as a pure IP MDT,
   then convert it to an MPLS Multipoint LSP (Label Switched Path) when
   it enters an MPLS-enabled region, and then convert it back to a pure
   IP MDT when it enters a non-MPLS-enabled region.
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-in-band-signaling] specifies the procedures for
   building such a hybrid MDT, using Protocol Independent Multicast
   (PIM) [RFC4601] as the control protocol in the non-MPLS region of the
   network, and using Multipoint Extensions to Label Distribution
   Protocol (mLDP) [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp] in the MPLS region.

   For a given tree, one or more routers that are at the border between
   a non-MPLS-enabled region and an MPLS-enabled region receive PIM
   control messages from the non-MPLS-enabled region, and convert them
   to mLDP control messages to be sent into the MPLS-enabled region.
   Another router that is at the border between a non-MPLS-enabled
   region and an MPLS-enabled region receives mLDP control messages from
   the MPLS-enabled region and converts them to PIM control messages to
   be sent into a non-MPLS-enabled region.

   In PIM, a tree is identified by a source address (or in the case of
   bidirectional trees [RFC5015], a rendezvous point address or "RPA")
   and a group address.  The tree is built from the leaves up, by
   sending PIM control messages in the direction of the source address
   or the RPA.  In mLDP, a tree is identified by a root address and an
   "opaque value", and is built by sending mLDP control messages in the
   direction of the root.  The procedures of
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-in-band-signaling] explain how to convert a PIM
   <source address or RPA, group address> pair into an mLDP <root node,
   opaque value> pair;, and how to convert the mLDP <root node, opaque
   value> pair back into the original PIM <source address or RPA, group
   address> pair.

   However, those procedures assume that the routers doing the PIM/mLDP
   conversion have routes to the source address or RPA in their global
   routing tables.  Thus the procedures cannot be applied exactly as
   specified when the interfaces connecting the non-MPLS-enabled region
   to the MPLS-enabled region are interfaces that belong to a VPN as
   described in [RFC4364].  This specification extends the procedures of
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-in-band-signaling] so that they may be applied in
   the VPN context.

   As in [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-in-band-signaling], the scope of this
   document is limited to the case where the multicast content is
   distributed in the non-MPLS-enabled regions via PIM-created Source-

   Specific or Bidirectional trees.  Bidirectional trees are always
   mapped onto Multipoint-to-Multipoint LSPs, and source-specific trees
   are always mapped onto Point-to-Multipoint LSPs.

   Each multicast tree in the non-MPLS enabled region is mapped 1-1 onto
   a multipoint LSP in the MPLS-enabled region.  For a variety of
   reasons (discussed in [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast]), this is not a
   suitable for a general purpose multicast VPN solution.  But the
   procedures described herein are much simpler than the general purpose
   MVPN procedures, and are applicable when the 1-1 mapping is
   acceptable, and when it is acceptable to use mLDP as the protocol for
   setting up the multipoint LSPs.  For example, some service providers
   offer multicast content to their customers, but have chosen to use
   VPNs to isolate the various customers and services.  This is a very
   different scenario than the general MVPN scenario, in which the
   customers provide their own multicast content, out of the control of
   the service provider.

   Due to the 1-1 mapping and the multicast source and group information
   being encoded in the mLDP FEC, there is deterministic mapping beween
   the multicast tree and the mLDP LSP in the core network.  This
   improves and simplifies fault resolution.

   In order to use the mLDP in-band signaling procedures for a
   particular group address in a particular VPN, the Provider Edge (PE)
   routers that attach to that VPN MUST be configured with a range of
   multicast group addresses for which mLDP in-band signaling is to be
   enabled.  This configuration is per VRF ("Virtual Routing and
   Forwarding table", defined in [RFC4364]).  For those groups, and
   those groups only, the procedures of this document are used instead
   of the general purpose Multicast VPN procedures.  This configuration
   must be present in all PE routers that attach to sites containing
   senders or receivers for the given set of group addresses.

   mLDP :  Multicast LDP.


   In-band signaling :  Using the opaque value of a mLDP FEC element to
      encode the (S,G) or (*,G) identifying a particular IP multicast
      tree.


   P2MP LSP:  An LSP that has one Ingress LSR and one or more Egress
      LSRs (see [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp]).


   MP2MP LSP:  An LSP that connects a set of leaf nodes, acting
      indifferently as ingress or egress (see [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp]).


   MP LSP:  A multipoint LSP, either a P2MP or an MP2MP LSP.


   Ingress LSR:  Source of a P2MP LSP, also referred to as root node.


2.  VPN In-band signaling for MP LSPs

   Suppose that a PE router, PE1, attaching to a particular VPN,
   receives a PIM Join(S,G) message over one of its VRF interfaces.
   Following the procedure of section 5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast], PE1 determines the "upstream RD", the
   "upstream PE", and the "upstream multicast hop" (UMH) for the source
   address S. Please note that sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast] are applicable.

   In order to transport the multicast tree via a MP LSP using VPN in-
   band signaling, an mLDP Label Mapping Message is sent by PE1.  This
   message will contain either a P2MP FEC or an MP2MP FEC (see
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp], depending upon whether the PIM tree being
   transported is a source-specific tree, or a bidirectional tree,
   respectively.  The FEC contains a "root" and an "opaque value".

   If the UMH and the upstream PE have the same IP address (i.e., the
   Upstream PE is the UMH), then the root of the Multipoint FEC is set
   to the IP address of the Upstream PE.  If, in the context of this
   VPN, (S,G) refers to a source-specific MDT, then the values of S, G,
   and the upstream RD are encoded into the opaque value.  If, in the
   context of this VPN, G is a bidirectional group address, then S is
   replaced with the value of the RPA associated with G. The coding
   details are specified in Section 3.  Conceptually, the Multipoint FEC
   can be thought of as an ordered pair: <root=Upstream-PE,



Wijnands, et al.          Expires April 9, 2012                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    mLDP In-band Signaling in VPN Context     October 2011


   opaque_value=<S or RPA ,G ,Upstream-RD>.  The mLDP Label Mapping
   Message is then sent by PE1 on its LDP session to the "next hop" on
   its path to the upstream PE.  The "next hop" is usually the IGP next
   hop, but see [I-D.napierala-mpls-targeted-mldp] for cases in which
   the next hop is not the IGP next hop.

   If the UMH and the upstream PE do not have the same IP address, the
   procedures of section 2 of [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-recurs-fec] should be
   applied.  The root node of the multipoint FEC is set to the UMH.  The
   recursive opaque value is then set as follows: the root node is set
   to the upstream PE, and the opaque value is set to the multipoint FEC
   described in the previous paragraph.  That is, the multipoint FEC can
   be thought of as the following recursive ordered pair: <root=UMH,
   opaque_value=<root=Upstream-PE, opaque_value =<S or RPA, G,
   Upstream-RD>>.

   The encoding of the multipoint FEC also specifies the "type" of PIM
   MDT being spliced onto the multipoint LSP.  Four types of MDT are
   defined: IPv4 source-specific tree, IPv6 source-specific tree, IPv4
   bidirectional tree, and IPv6 bidirectional tree.

   When a PE router receives an mLDP message with a P2MP or MP2MP FEC,
   where the PE router itself is the root node, and the opaque value is
   one of the types defined in Section 3, then it uses the RD encoded in
   the opaque value field to determine the VRF context.  (This RD will
   be associated with one of the PEs VRFs.)  Then, in the context of
   that VRF, the PE follows the procedure specified in section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-in-band-signaling].

   Group:  IPv6 multicast group address, 16 octets.


   RD:  Route Distinguisher, 8 octets.


4.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations apply as for the base LDP
   specification, described in [RFC5036], and the base mLDP
   specification, described in [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp]


5.  IANA considerations

   [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp] defines a registry for "The LDP MP Opaque
   Value Element Basic Type".  This document requires the assignment of
   four new code points in this registry:

      Transit VPNv4 Source TLV type - requested 10

      Transit VPNv6 Source TLV type - requested 11

      Transit VPNv4 Bidir TLV type - requested 12

      Transit VPNv6 Bidir TLV type - requested 13


6.  Acknowledgments

   Thanks to Eric Rosen and Andy Green for their comments on the draft.
