This memo introduces a "6to4 anycast address" in order to simplify the
configuration of 6to4 routers.  It also defines how this address will
be used by 6to4 relay routers, how the corresponding "6to4 anycast
prefix" will be advertised in the IGP and in the EGP.  The memo
documents the reservation by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority) of the "6to4 relay anycast prefix."
