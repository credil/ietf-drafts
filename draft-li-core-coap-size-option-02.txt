Internet-Draft              CoAP-Size-Option                October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This specification adds a new option Size to the Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP).  The main purpose is to indicate the
   resource size in a PUT/POST request, or in a GET response.

1.1.  Justification

   If the requester wants to retrieve large resource data using a GET
   request, it is better to know in advance the size of the resource
   data.  Currently in the Link Format [I-D.ietf-core-link-format]
   specification, the maximum size estimate attribute "sz" is defined to
   give an indication of the estimated maximum size of the resource
   data.  By using this, the requester is able to know whether it is
   capable to accept the resource data.  However it is not possible for
   the requester to know exactly how many blocks will be transmitted,
   therefore, concurrent GET can't be supported.

   Also in a POST/PUT request (for example, a firmware update), it is
   not possible for the recipient to know in advance what is the size of
   the data to be transmitted.  According to the current CoAP
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap] specification, when transmitting large data, the
   recipient will return an error code 4.13 (Request Entity Too Large)
   to the requester when the data size is too big to be accepted by the
   recipient.  In this case the whole transmission has failed, and the
   previous received data will be useless.  This is a waste of
   transmission resources.

   This document adds the new Size Option to provide the capability to
   indicate the accurate size in a GET response or in a POST/PUT
   request.

   By using the Size Option in a GET response, the CoAP Server can let
   the requester know the actual size of the resource in advance.  This
   is especially useful for large resources, and can facilitate the
   requester to allocate enough buffer space before transmission.  Also,
   using the block size, the requester can calculate the total number of
   blocks and can use concurrent GET requests to retrieve resource data
   using the Block Option.  Finally, the recipient can check the
   resource size after the data transmission has been completed.

   By using the Size Option in a PUT/POST request, the requester can
   indicate the resource size in the first Block Option message, to let
   the recipient know the resource data size in advance.  If the
   recipient is not able to receive the data with the indicated size,
   the recipient can tell the requester in a response code, avoiding the
   cost of the actual data transmission.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Size Option Extension

2.1.  Size Option Definition


           +------+-----+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+
           | Type | C/E | Name  | Data type | Length | Default       |
           +------+-----+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+
           |  18  |  E  | Size  | uint      | 0-4 B  |               |
           +------+-----+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+

2.2.  Using the Size Option

   The Size Option is used to indicate the size of the resource data
   measured in bytes.

   The GET request including Size=0 is treated as a request to get the
   size of the resource representation (but not the resource payload).

   The GET request including an empty Size option is treated as a
   request to get the size of the resource representation with the
   resource payload.

   The Size option MUST be included in the GET response, if the Size
   option is present in the request.

   Also it SHOULD be used in a POST/PUT request in the first Block
   Option message.

   The Size option SHOULD be included for resources larger than a single
   PDU, if the Size information is available.  And it MAY be included
   for resources smaller than a single MTU.

   In the absence of the option, the size of the resource data is
   calculated after the data has been transmitted to the recipient,
   either from the CoAP payload length or based on number of blocks and
   block size.

   If the Size option is specified it SHOULD be accurate at that time,
   and SHOULD NOT be an estimate.

Internet-Draft              CoAP-Size-Option                October 2011


   But due to the dynamic change of the resource data, the Size may not
   be accurate.  If the value of Size option is not the same as the
   actual transmitted data, the recipient MUST take the size of the
   actual transmitted data as accurate, and ignore the Size option.  In
   case that the recipient gets all the data but it is still smaller
   than the announced Size, the recipient SHOULD stop the transmission.
   If the recipient finds out the transmitted data reaches the Size
   limit, and there's more data left, the recipient SHOULD continue to
   transmit the remaining data.

   This option is "Elective".  It MUST NOT occur more than once.


3.  Interaction with Block option

3.1.  Usage in POST/PUT Request

   In a PUT/POST request for large resource data, the requester SHOULD
   use the Size option to indicate the size of the resource.  If the
   recipient is not capable to receive the data with the indicated size,
   the recipient MUST return a 4.13 (Request Entity Too Large) response
   code to the requester, and the data transmission is avoided, so that
   the cost of the actual data transmission is saved.

3.2.  Usage in GET Response

   In a GET response for large resource data, the CoAP Server SHOULD use
   the Size option to indicate the resource size and return the first
   block data.  The requester can calculate the number of blocks to be
   transferred based on the block size and the resource size, and use
   concurrent GET requests to retrieve resource data.  Also, when the
   client determines it cannot process data of this Size, it MAY choose
   to abort and not to send subsequent GETs.


4.  How to merge into Block draft

   This section introduces how to merge the Size option draft into Block
   draft with the minimum functionalities.

4.1.  The Size option

   This section will work as section 2.3 in Block draft.

           |  18  |  E  | Size  | uint      | 1-4 B  |               |
           +------+-----+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+

4.2.  Using the Size option

   This section will work as section 2.4 in Block draft.

   The Size Option is used to indicate the size of the resource data
   measured in bytes.

   The Size option SHOULD be used in a POST/PUT request in the first
   Block Option message.  If the recipient is not capable to receive the
   data with the indicated size, the recipient MUST return a 4.13
   (Request Entity Too Large) response code to the requester, and the
   data transmission is avoided, so that the cost of the actual data
   transmission is saved.

   For a GET request, if it includes an empty Size option, the Size
   option MUST be included in the response.  If the GET request includes
   a Block option, the Size option SHOULD be included in the first Block
   response.  In other cases the GET response MAY contain a Size option.

   If the Size option is specified, it SHOULD be accurate at that time,
   and SHOULD NOT be an estimate.

   The option is "Elective".  It MUST NOT occur more than once.

4.3.  Example

   Example as indicated as Figure 2 in this draft can be added in
   section 3 in the Block draft.


5.  Examples

   This section gives a number of short examples with message flows to
   illustrate the use of Size option in a GET response, or in a PUT/POST
   request.

   The first example (Figure 1) shows that the requester does not know
   the resource data size, and sends the GET request, the recipient can
   send back the resource size using the Size option and the first
   block.  In the subsequent GET request, the requester can calculate
   the number of blocks and use concurrent GET requests to retrieve the
   resource data.

                         Figure 1: Size Option in a GET response

   The second example (Figure 2) shows the requester sending a PUT
   request with the Size option to indicate the resource data size, and
   since the recipient determines that the resource data is too large to
   be accepted, it sends back a 4.13 (Request Entity Too Large) response
   code.

      CLIENT                                                     SERVER

        | CON [MID=1234], PUT, /options, 1/0/128, Size: 5000 ----> |

6.  Security Considerations

   As the size option is used to determine whether or not the reciepient
   will accept the data, lying about it can cause the recipient to make
   a wrong decision.  For example, an attacker might reduce the reported
   size such that the recipient will accept, even when it cannot process
   the complete data.

   Related is another attack, where the attacker changes the reported
   size to a higher value, leading to the recipient rejecting even when
   it has the capability to receive.

   The latter attack is similar to an attack where the attacker blocks

   the packets altogether; although it is more efficient since the
   attacker only needs to modify one message.  The former attack needs
   serious consideration at implementation level, especially concerning
   possible buffer overflows that might lead to data leaking into the
   code.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add the following Option Number entry.

                   +--------+---------------+----------------+
                   | Number | Name          | Reference      |
                   +--------+---------------+----------------+
                   |  18    | Size          | Section 2      |
