Internet-Draft             Proportional Quota               October 2011


1.  Introduction

   The base specification of RELOAD defines two variables to set the
   storage quota.  The first one is the maximum size of an element of a
   specific kind, the second one is the maximum number of elements of a
   specific kind that can be stored on a specific peer.  The combination
   of the two variables permits to limit the quantity of data that a
   peer have to store.

   For kinds that are used with an access control policy that does not
   restrict the Resource-IDs, a different algorithm is needed to force
   storing nodes to behave.  This document describes a quota algorithm
   that limits the number of elements of a specific kind that a node can
   store in the overlay, independently of the Resource-ID used.  Another
   way to look at this quota algorithm is that an entity must provide a
   number of peers that is proportional to the number of elements of a
   specific kind that this entity wants to store.

   It is important to understand that this quota works only for an
   overlay comprising only peers, and so with a configuration file
   containing a <clients-permitted> element set to false.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Quota Algorithm

   A peer responsible for storing kinds using the quota algorithm
   described in this document MUST maintain a count of the number of
   unique entries being stored per signer for each kind.  This operation
   does not require to add a field containing the Node-ID as the Node-ID
   of the signer is always available indirectly from the signature field
   of each element stored.

   For example if a peer is storing 5 Resource-IDs and at each of those
   5 there are two entries, all signed by the same Node-ID, it means
   this node is currently storing 10 unique entries for that Node-ID.

   When performing the quota checks for an entry, the peer starts by
   verifying that the size of the entry is consistent.  If the entry if
   not for a replica, it then takes the <max-count> configuration
   parameter for this overlay, which measures the amount of entries of a
   specific kind a particular node can store when a <max-count-

Internet-Draft             Proportional Quota               October 2011


   per>SIGNER</max-count-per> configuration parameter is also present.
   That value is divided by the fraction of the overlay owned by this
   peer.  If the result is less than one, it is rounded up to two.  This
   is the maximum number of unique entries that can be stored for this
   signer.  If the peer is not yet storing this many entries for that
   Node-ID, the store is allowed.

   Note that when evaluating a Store Request containing multiple entries
   per kind, the count of unique entries used for the evaluation is
   incremented after each successful check, but the count will be reset
   to its initial value if one of the check fails.

   The algorithm does not apply to the replicas created by the topology
   plugin.  If another level of replication is done at the application
   level, the <max-count> value must be adjusted accordingly.

   Note that because of imperfect distribution of Resource-IDs across
   the ring, new entries can be rejected even if the total count is
   under the limit.  It is the responsibility of the storing entity to
   calculate the maximum acceptable probability of rejection and to
   increase the number of peers accordingly.

   [[Note: Add here the equation that can be used to calculate the
   probability of rejection, so applications using this quota mechanism
   can recommend a multiplier coefficient]]


4.  Overlay Configuration Document Extension

   This document extends the overlay configuration document by defining
   a new element in the "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:p2p:quota" namespace.

   The <max-count-per> element changes the meaning of the <max-count>
   variable.  The value "PEER" forces the <max-count> to be interpreted
   as been per storing peer, which is the default quota algorithm when
   this extension is not used.  The value "SIGNER" forces the <max-
   count> to be interpreted as been per signer, which is the algorithm
   defined by this document.

   The Compact Relax NG Grammar for this element is:

   namespace pqt = "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:p2p:quota"

   kind-parameter &= element pqt:max-count-per { max-count-per-type }
   max-count-per-type |= "PEER"
   max-count-per-type |= "SIGNER"
   max-count-per-type |= xsd:string # extensions

A.1.  Modifications between
      draft-petithuguenin-vipr-proportional-quota-00 and
      draft-petithuguenin-p2psip-proportional-quota-01

   o  The quota does not apply to replicas.
   o  Draft moved to VIPR WG.
   o  Nits.

A.2.  Modifications between
      draft-petithuguenin-p2psip-proportional-quota-01 and
      draft-petithuguenin-p2psip-proportional-quota-00

   o  Changed "storing peer" to "signer" as this works also for replica
      peers.
   o  The default quota algorithm is per storing peer, not per
      Resource-ID.
   o  Changed the constants in the XML extension accordingly.
   o  Added running code considerations for reference implementation.

A.3.  Modifications between
      draft-petithuguenin-p2psip-proportional-quota-00 and
      draft-petithuguenin-vipr-reload-usage-00

   o  Instead of having a StorageQuota parameter that gives the maximum
      number of entries, reused the max-count parameter (that is
      mandatory anyway) and changes its meaning.
   o  Removed the 3x multiplier to account for the application layer
      COPY, as it is application specific.
   o  Removed the additional 3x multiplier to compensate for imperfect
      distribution, and moved the responsibility to the storing nodes.

A.4.  Running Code Considerations

   o  Reference Implementation
      (<http://debian.implementers.org/testing/source/reload.tar.gz>).
      Marc Petit-Huguenin.  Implements version vipr-00.
