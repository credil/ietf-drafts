Internet-Draft             Traffic Offloading               October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines an extension to Neighbor Discovery
   Protocol [RFC4861], which allows management of IPv6 traffic
   offloading to IPv4 and moving IPv4 traffic away from a specific
   network connection.

   The described solution is intended to be used during transition
   towards IPv6, during which time multi-interfaced hosts are often
   likely to have network interfaces with IPv4-only capability.  A
   common scenario where coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6 network interfaces
   is expected to occur is when a smartphone has IPv6-enabled cellular
   connection and IPv4-only WLAN connection active at the same time.


2.  Requirements and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Problem Background

   Current Internet hosts generally prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4
   addresses when performing source and destination address selections,
   as is recommended in [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484-revise].

   A multi-interfaced host may have IPv6 enabled on a more 'expensive'
   interface and a 'cheaper' interface may have support only for IPv4.
   In such a scenario it might be desirable for hosts to prefer IPv4 in
   communication instead of IPv6.

   The above mentioned scenario can become a problem, for example, when
   a smartphone has simultaneously IPv6-enabled cellular connection
   ([I-D.ietf-v6ops-3gpp-eps]) and IPv4-only WLAN connectivity active.
   When connecting to dual-stack capable destinations it would
   oftentimes be generally more efficient to use WLAN network interface.
   Furthermore, a cellular network operator may want hosts to offload
   traffic away from cellular network whenever hosts have alternate
   network accesses available.

   Similar issue can arise also when a host has multiple interfaces with
   IPv4 connectivity.  The interface that provides better performance at
   a lower price should oftentimes be used for the communication, but it
   may not be clear for a host which one of the available interfaces it
   should prefer.

4.  Solution

   This document introduces a new Neighbor Discovery option that a
   network can use to communicate the level of router's willingness to
   act as a router for IPv4 traffic.

   The new Neighbor Discovery option was chosen to support hosts without
   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] support and also to work on networks not utilizing
   DHCPv6.

   The new Neighbor Discovery option can be used together with the Route
   Information option defined in [RFC4191] to communicate offloading
   information for specific routes.

   The new Neighbor Discovery option shall be phased out when IPv4 usage
   diminishes.

4.1.  Neighbor Discovery Offload Option

   This specification defines a new Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] option
   called Offload (Type TBD) to be used in Router Advertisements.  The
   option is illustrated in Figure 1.  Router and hosts implementing
   this specification MUST understand the Offload option.

   D (IPv4 Gateway Preference)

      Indicates the willingness of the Dual-Stack capable router (who
      originated the Router Advertisement) to serve as a gateway for the
      IPv4 traffic.  If 'D' is unset (0) then the router indicates no
      specific to be or not to be a gateway for IPv4 traffic.  If 'D' is
      set (1) then the router explicitly indicates it is not willing to
      serve as a gateway for IPv4 traffic if there are other usable
      gateways present in the same or other available interfaces.

   Reserved

      A 15-bit unused field.  It MUST be initialized to zero by the
      sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Gateway

      The address of the dual-stack router's IPv4 interface used as the
      next-hop from hosts point of view for sending and receiving IPv4
      traffic on this link.  The IPv4 address MUST belong to the same
      interface that originated the Router Advertisement containing this
      option.  If the router is IPv6 only, then this field MUST be set
      to unspecified address (0.0.0.0) or the Neighbor Discovery Offload
      option MUST be omitted in all Router Advertisements originated by
      the router.

   Lifetime

      16-bit unsigned integer.  The Lifetime in seconds limits the
      validity of state changes caused by this new option.  The value of
      Lifetime in this option SHOULD be smaller than the value of Route
      Lifetime contained in the Route Information option [RFC4191], if
      present, in the same Router Advertisement.

   Padding

      The padding MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and MUST be
      ignored by the receiver.

   The behavior of 'IPv4 Gateway Preference' (see Section 4.2) is
   discussed in more detail in the following sections.  The usage of
   'Gateway' for offloading is discussed in Section 4.3 and Section 4.4.
   The Offload option is only used in Router Advertisement messages.

4.2.  Lowering IPv4 Router Preference

   The 'D' flag bit in the Offload option indicates the willingness of
   Dual-Stack capable router originating the Router Advertisement to

Internet-Draft             Traffic Offloading               October 2011


   serve as a gateway for IPv4 traffic.  If 'D' is set (1), the router
   indicates that it SHOULD NOT be used as a gateway for IPv4 traffic,
   if other gateways are present in the same or other available
   interfaces.  If 'D' is unset (0), the router does not indicate any
   preference of being or not being a gateway for IPv4 traffic.  When
   'D' is unset (0), the decision of temporarily modifying the routing
   status is left for hosts that receive the Offload option (see
   Section 4.3 and Section 4.4).  The 'Gateway' field in the Offload
   option contains the IPv4 address of the Dual-Stack interface that
   originated the Router Advertisement.  The address serves as the
   identification of the next-hop IPv4 routers.

4.3.  IPv4 Offloading to Specific Routes

   To enable offloading of IPv4 traffic to specific routes, both Offload
   option and Route Information option [RFC4191] MUST present in the
   same Router Advertisement.  A host receiving such Router
   Advertisement need to maintain a set of status including specific
   route, Router Preference, and Lifetime.  A specific route consists of
   an IPv4 gateway from the Offload option and an IPv4 prefix from the
   Route Information option.  The Prefix field in the Route Information
   option SHOULD follow the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address format defined in
   [RFC4291].  The Prefix Length in the Route Information option is used
   to indicate the IPv4 prefix length.  The Router Preference in the
   Route Information option indicates whether to prefer the IPv4 router
   associated with this prefix over others.  The Lifetime in the Offload
   option determines how long the temporarily added specific route will
   be valid.  The Lifetime field in Route Information option SHOULD be
   ignored.

   When 'D' flag is unset (0) in the Offload option, the advertised
   specific route shall be added by hosts if there is no duplicated
   prefix matching to the advertised prefix and the advertised lifetime
   in Offload option is valid.  If there is a matching prefix, such
   specific route will be updated or deleted according to the status of
   Lifetime and Router Preference.  The Lifetime in Offload option
   determines whether the route will be deleted or updated depending on
   the existing routing status of the hosts.  If the advertised Lifetime
   is set to 0, any matched prefix and the corresponding route MUST be
   removed.  If Lifetime is valid, the Router Preference further
   determines whether the gateway of the existing route, if matched,
   will be substituted to the advertised one, or the lifetime for
   existing route will be updated.

   When 'D' flag is set (1) in the Offload option, any existing specific
   routes with the next-hop router matching to the advertised gateway
   SHOULD be removed.

Internet-Draft             Traffic Offloading               October 2011


   To avoid misconfiguration of offloading operation, only one Offload
   option is allowed in a single Router Advertisement.

4.4.  IPv4 Offloading to Default Gateway

   If there is no Route Information options containing IPv4-mapped IPv6
   addresses in the same Router Advertisement, the default gateway for
   offloading can be added, updated, or deleted depending on the 'D'
   flag, Lifetime, and existing routing status on the hosts.  When 'D'
   is set (1), the existing default gateway matching to the advertised
   one SHOULD be removed if there are other usable gateways present in
   the same or other available interfaces.

   When 'D' is unset (0) and there is no default gateway present for the
   receiving interface, the advertised gateway with valid lifetime can
   be added.  If the advertised gateway matches to the existing one on
   the host, depending on the advertised lifetime, the existing default
   gateway shall be updated to the advertised lifetime in Offload option
   or deleted if the lifetime is set 0.  If there is a default gateway
   existing on the receiving interface, which does not match to the
   advertised gateway, the advertised one SHOULD be ignored.

4.5.  Offload Lifetime

   The lifetime in the Offload option determines the valid period of
   temporary routing changes including IPv4 gateway preferences and
   offloading of IPv4 traffic to specific routes and default gateway.
   If the router sends a new Router Advertisement without the Offload
   option before the router lifetime expires, it is an indication to the
   receiving hosts that any existing Offload option caused state/
   information MUST be removed.


5.  Router Behavior

   A router configuration SHOULD allow network administrator to add and
   configure this option into Router Advertisement messages.  The
   configuration can be selectively enabled (the Offload option is
   included in the Router Advertisement) or disabled (the Offload option
   is not included in the Router Advertisement).  For specific route
   offloading, the prefix(es) advertised in the Route Information option
   SHOULD follow IPv4 mapped IPv6 address (e.g. ::ffff:1.2.3.4) as
   described in 4.3.


6.  Host Behavior

   A multi-interface capable host SHOULD monitor presence of Offload



Korhonen, et al.           Expires May 3, 2012                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             Traffic Offloading               October 2011


   option in received Router Advertisement messages.  When the Offload
   option is received, the IPv4 gateway preferences and offloading to
   default gateway shall temporarily be updated as described in 4.2 and
   4.4.  Depending on the presence of Route Information in the same
   Router Advertisement, the offloading to specific IPv4 routes shall
   temporarily be updated as described in 4.3.  Hosts SHOULD uses the
   lifetime value in the Offload option to determine the valid time of
   all routing changes caused by the Router Advertisement received.

   If the host receives a Router Advertisement without the Offload
   option and there is an existing state created by an earlier received
   Offload option, then the host MUST remove all IPv4 gateway
   preferences and offloading modifications from the previous Router
   Advertisement.  The removals concerns the prefixes configured from
   router where the router advertisement was received.


7.  Security Considerations

   The Offload option allows malicious hosts and routers to affect a
   victim host's next hop and default address selection if spoofing of
   Router Advertisements are possible on the access link.  This is a
   well-known and understood security threat [RFC3756] and can be
   mitigated using, for example, Secure Neighbor Discovery [RFC3971].
   The security of utilizing the Offload option is at the equal level to
   solution in [RFC4191].


8.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines a new Neighbor Discovery option described
   in Section 4.1.

Appendix A.  Address Selection Approach

A.1.  Modification to Default Address Selection

   The 'lower-than-IPv4 Preference' affects the Source Address Selection
   Rule 3.  The notation Lower(SA) returns true if the address SA was
   configured from the prefixes advertised by a 'lower-than-IPv4
   Preference' router.  Lower(SA) returns false is the address SA was
   configured from prefixes advertised by other than 'lower-than-IPv4
   Preference' router.  The notation Default(D) returns false if the
   address D has more specific routes (i.e. other than the default
   route).  Default(D) returns true if the address D points only to a
   default route.  The modified Rule 3 would be as follows:






Korhonen, et al.           Expires May 3, 2012                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             Traffic Offloading               October 2011


   Rule 3:  Avoid deprecated addresses.

      The addresses SA and SB have the same scope.  If Lower(SA) == true
      and Default(D) == true, then mark SA temporarily as "deprecated".
      If Lower(SB) == true and Default(D) == true, then mark SB
      temporarily as "deprecated".  If one of the two source addresses
      is "preferred" and one of them is "deprecated" (in the [RFC4862]
      sense), then prefer the one that is "preferred."

   Similar modification also concerns the Destination Address Selection
   Rule 3 when checking whether a candidate source address for a given
   destination is deprecated.

A.2.  Address selection examples

   Link-local addresses are omitted in all following examples.  The
   assumption is that possible destinations have a global scope and all
   IPv6 enabled interfaces have at least one global scope IPv6 address.
   Therefore, the default address selection would always output global
   scope addresses over link-local addresses.

A.2.1.  Case 1: IPv6-only cellular and IPv4-only WLAN accesses

   A host has obtained global IPv6 address, 2001:db8::2, on a cellular
   interface and with it has received Neighbor Discovery option with
   'lower-than-IPv4' preference.  The host also has global IPv4 address,
   192.0.2.2, on a WLAN interface.

   When connecting to a dual-stack enabled destination, both 2001:db8::2
   and 192.0.2.2 are considered as source addresses candidates.  IPv4
   address is selected, because 2001:db8::2 is considered deprecated.
   Hence host uses WLAN for communication.

   When connecting to IPv6-only destination, 2001:db8::2 is selected and
   cellular network used, as there are no other IPv6 addresses
   available.

A.2.2.  Case 2: WLAN access with multiple prefixes

   A host has obtained two global IPv6 addresses, one of which was from
   a router indicating 'lower-than-IPv4' preference.  For example, 2001:
   db8:1::2 from router with 'lower-than-IPv4' preference and
   2001:db8:2::3 from router without any special preferences.

   When connecting to IPv6-only destination, both addresses are
   considered as source address candidates.  Source address selection
   chooses 2001:db8:2::3 as 2001:db8:1::2 is considered deprecated
   (Lower(2001:db8::2) == true and Default(D) == true).

A.2.3.  Case 3: WLAN and cellular interface with cellular's IPv4 not
        default route

   A host has obtained IPv6 address, 2001:db8::2, and IPv4 address,
   192.0.2.2, from cellular network.  The network has indicated 'lower-
   than-IPv4' preference for IPv6 and 'not your default router' for
   IPv4.  The host also has dual-stack WLAN access with 2001:db8:1::3
   and 192.0.2.30 addresses.

   When connecting to IPv4-only destination, host selects 192.0.2.30 as
   source address because default gateway on the interface of 192.0.2.2
   address is 'not default gateway'.  WLAN is used for communication.

   When connecting to IPv6-only destination, host selects 2001:db8:1::3
   from WLAN interface as the 2001:db8::2 is considered deprecated
   (Lower(2001:db8::2) == true and Default(D) == true).  WLAN is used
   for communication.

   When connecting to dual-stack destination, host selects from the four
   candidate addresses 2001:db8:1::3, as IPv6 is preferred in general
   and as that address is not deprecated.  WLAN is used for
   communication.

A.2.4.  Case 4: Dual-stack cellular access

   A host has obtained IPv6 address, 2001:db8::2, and IPv4 address,
   192.0.2.2, from cellular network.  The network has indicated 'lower-
   than-IPv4' preference.

   When connecting to a dual-stack enabled destination, both addresses
   are considered as candidate source addresses.  IPv4 address is
   chosen, because IPv6 address is considered deprecated.

A.2.5.  Case 5: Dual-stack cellular and single stack WLAN

   A host has obtained IPv6 address, 2001:db8::2, and IPv4 address,
   192.0.2.2, from cellular network.  The network has indicated 'lower-
   than-IPv4' preference for IPv6 and 'not your default router' for
   IPv4.  The host also has WLAN access with 192.0.2.30 address.

   When connecting to dual-stack destination, all three addresses are
   considered as source address candidates.  The IPv4 address from WLAN,
   192.0.2.30, is selected as the IPv6 address, 2001:db8::2, is
   considered deprecated and as the IPv4 default route points to WLAN.
   Hence WLAN is used for communication.

A.2.6.  Case 6: Coexistence with RFC4191

   A host has obtained IPv6 address, 2001:db8:1::2/64 from cellular
   network.  The network has indicated 'lower-than-IPv4' preference for
   IPv6 and a more specific route to 2001:db8:2::/48.  The host also has
   IPv6 WLAN access with 2001:db8:3::3/64 address.

   When connecting to 2001:db8:2::1 the host selects 2001:db8:1::2 from
   cellular interface as a source address, because Lower(2001:db8:1::2)
   == true and Default(2001:db8:2::1) == false and hence the
   2001:db8:1::2 is not considered as deprecated address even though
   'lower-than-IPv4' preference was advertised.

   When connecting to 2001:db8:4::1 the host selects 2001:db8:3::3 from
   WLAN interface as a source address, because Lower(2001:db8:2::1) ==
   true and Default(2001:db8:3::3) == true) and hence 2001:db8:2::1 is
   considered as deprecated address.
