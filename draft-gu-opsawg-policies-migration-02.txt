Abstract

   In accompany with the migration of a Virtual Machine (VM), state
   associated with the VM located on the Hypervisors and the network
   side devices (e.g., Firewalls) need to be updated in order to
   guarantee that the services executed on the migrated VM will not be
   disrupted.  VM vendors have their own ways to migrate VM's state on
   Hypervisors, and so this is out the scope of this draft.This draft
   introduces the background of state migration on network devices using
   several application scenarios and tries to specify a clear scope for
   the future standardization work on state migration on network
   devices.

Internet-Draft               State Migration                    Mar 2012


1.  Introduction

   Under the assistance of a VM live migration mechanism, a VM can move
   across physical servers, racks, subnets, or even DCs (Data Centers).
   During the migration, the services executed on the VM should not be
   significantly interrupted.  In order to achieve objective, not only
   the hypervisor that the VM moves to but also any related devices on
   the network side must update their state cooperatively.  For
   instance, assume that a VM executed on a server is under the
   protection of a Firewall A. The VM creates several connections with
   external clients.  The state information associated with the
   connections is generated and maintained in the session table of A.
   Any inbound packets to the VM will be checked against the session
   table, and the packets that doesn't match any recorded connection
   will be discarded.  Now, the VM migrates to another rack, which is
   under the management of Firewall B. Because B has no knowledge about
   the connections created by the VM, any packets belonging to the
   connections will be discarded by B. As a result, the connections will
   finally be broken.  A more detailed description can be found in
   Section 4.

   There are various middleboxes embedded in the network (e.g.,
   Firewalls, IPSes, IDSes, NATs and etc) which may need state
   migration.  To benefit the discussion, Firewalls are used as an
   example to analyze the state updating issues caused by VM live
   migration.


2.  Terminologies and concepts

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Virtual Machine (VM), A completely isolated operation system which is
   installed by software on a normal operation system.  An normal
   operation system can be virtualized into several VM.

   Firewall (FW), A policy based security device, typically used for
   restricting access to/from specific devices and applications.


3.  States On Firewalls

   Basically, there are In this draft, we consider two complimentary
   physical Firewall deployment solutions in DCs.

   o  Centralized Deployment.  In this case, typically, a pair of
      centralized powerful Firewalls are deployed at WAN connect point.
      Any traffic, even the traffic between VMs within the same LAN,
      need to pass though the Firewall.  Centralized deployed Firewalls
      need to be reliable and capable to deal with large amounts of
      traffic.

   o  Distributed deployment.  In this case, Firewalls are deployed at
      aggregation switches or lower access switches in a distributed
      way.  The goal of this kind of distributed deployed Firewall is to
      off load the huge workload on centralized Firewall.  This case is
      especially reasonable for large layer 2 network with tens even
      hundreds of thousands of Virtual Machines.Note that both the
      centralized and distributed solutions can co-exist in DCs.

   In either solution, the Firewalls need to generate and maintain the
   state (e.g., security policies and connection information) to process
   packets.  In the remainder of this section, three types of state
   information supported by most stateful Firewalls are introduced
   respectively.

3.1.  Session Table

   A stateful Firewall needs to establish a record for every connection
   associated a host (which could a physical server or a VM) under its
   protection.  Typically, a connection record should contain following
   parameters.

   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | Item          | Interpretation                                    |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | Src-IP        | Source IP Address of the connection               |
   | Dst-IP        | Destination IP Address of the connection          |
   | Src-Port      | Source Port Number used to establish the session  |
   | Dst-Port      | Destination Port Number used to establish the     |
   |               | session                                           |
   | Protocol      | Protocol type, e.g.  TCP                          |
   | Status        | The status of a connection, e.g.  Established or  |
   |               | SYN_ACK.                                          |
   | Interface     | The inbound interface of the connection           |
   | Creation-Time | The time that the session is created              |
   | Last-heard    | The last time that a packet belong to this        |
   |               | connection is received by Firewall                |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+

   Of course, not all of the information in the session table on a
   source Firewall is meaningful for the destination Firewall.  For
   instance, the Interface parameter is meaningless to destination

   Firewall.  Thus, not all of the information need to be migrated to
   destination Firewall in state migration,.

3.2.  Cumulative Data

   In order to deal with DOS (Deny of Service ) attacks, Firewalls need
   to cumulate certain types of data.  For instance, assume there are
   both individual clients and enterprise servers in a DC.  A malicious
   client tries to perform a SYN Flooding attack to degrade the
   performance of a server in the same DC.  That is, the client keeps
   sending SYN message to the server with a un-reasonably high rate.  To
   detect this attack, Firewalls in the DC need to cumulate the SYN
   message sent from the clients.  If a Firewall finds that the
   frequency of SYN message sent by a client exceed a pre-defined rate,
   the IP address of this client will be drawn into a black list by the
   Firewall.

3.3.  Access Control List

   Static Access Control List (ACL) can be configured on Firewall to
   filter packets between internal and external network, or between
   different security zones.  Usually 5-tuple, VLAN information and
   interface information are designated in ACL.  Static ACL is not
   generated dynamically based on flow, so there could be other way to
   re-configure ACL except for state migration, e.g. manually configure
   the static ACL on destination Firewall before VM migration.


4.  Scenarios for Migration of States on Firewall

   This section demonstrates the necessity of migrating Firewall states
   when a VM is moved to a new place using several real-life scenarios.

4.1.  VM Migration between different DCs

   China Telecom has several geographically distributed DCs.  These DCs
   were built several years ago and can only provide limited computing
   and storage services.  Because the accelerating urbanization in
   China, the places where the DCs locate has become downtown areas, and
   it is very expensive to extend their scales, which cannot be afforded
   by China Telecom.  As a result, sometimes, China Telecom has to use
   computing and storage resources of multiple DCs to support a single
   service (e.g., Instance messaging or search engine).  Such
   combination of DCs should be seamless so that the service provider
   can work in the same way as they work in a single DC, even when its
   VMs need to migrate from one DC to another.

   Figure 1 illustrates an example in which a DC provider has two DCs on

   different locations.  One is at City A; the other is at City B, which
   is 30 kilometers away from City A. Assume that the physical distance
   and network bandwidth between City A and B satisfy the requirements
   of VM live migration.  Two DCs are interconnected by, for example,
   VPLS (, [RFC4761][RFC4762]) or OTV ([OTV]).  Each DC has a pair of
   centralized Firewalls.  For simplicity, each DC only has only one
   Firewall as shown the figure.

   In the figure, Firewalls are shown separately from CEs.  But in real-
   life deployment, they could be integrated within CEs.

   At the very beginning, VMs are evenly created on Pod1 and Pod2.  As
   time elapses, the overload imposed on Pod1 and Pod2 increases.  Now,
   for some reasons (e.g., hardware errors), Pod2 need to be switched
   off and Pod1 does not have sufficient capability to support the VMs
   on Pod2.  In order to guarantee SLA, Pod3 is created and some of the
   VMs on Pod1 and Pod2 are migrated to Pod3, and the running service
   must be kept during the migration.

   One way to achieve this is to migrate VMs but let the flow still pass
   through FW1, VPLS-PE1 and GW1.  But in that case, the traffic is not
   optimized, which means more packet delay and more bandwidth
   consumption.  And another essential problem is that FW1' would drop
   the packets since FW1' cannot map the flow to any recorded session.

   So another way is to migrate states on FW1 to FW1' and let the flow
   pass through FW1', VPLS-PE1' and GW1'.

   The DCs could be in different subnets and we need to make sure the IP
   address of VM be kept unchanged during the VM live migration.  Some
   existing work, e.g. in IETF LISP WG ([LISP]), can make VM migration
   between subnets feasible.  In State Migration, we won't try to define
   technologies that can be used to keep VM's IP address unchanged while
   migrating between subnets.

   During nighttime, most of the VMs are shut down.  In order to save
   energy, the VMs still active are migrated to a few physical servers
   and other physical servers are switched off.  In this case, the
   states on FW1 need to be updated under the assistance of FW1,
   otherwise the running service on migrating VM will be disrupted.

5.  Active-Active or VM Migration

   In previous WG discussion on State Migration, there is suggestions to
   use alternative mechanism to migrate user's service instead of VM
   Migration, and hence no necessity to do State Migration.  The
   suggested mechanism is to run active-active VMs on both old and new
   locations.  The new services related to the old VM is directed to the
   new VM and shut down the old VM while all the existing services are
   finished.  In fact, this is not within the scope of State Migration
   intention.  But since State Migration proposal is based on the
   precondition that VM is migrating, the authors would like to list
   some reasons to clarify why VM Migration is necessary.

   o   Long lived connections: Some applications may establish
       connections with virtual machines and the connections are kept
       for a long time until the applications disconnect.  An example is
       the HTTP persistent connection technique,.  The idea is to
       generate a pool of TCP connections.  Instead of opening a new one
       for every single request/response pair, a TCP connection may be
       re-used to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/
       responses.Unused TCP connections are then stored in the pool.
       This solution is also widely used for improving performance of
       network systems (e.g., distributed database systems).  The above
       examples make it very clear that it's unexpected how long the
       existing services will be alive, that is it's unexpected how long
       the old VM need to be kept active.

   o   Hardware failure: While there is hardware problem, it may not
       leave enough time to wait until all the existing services are
       finished.  For example, there may be a power shortage in a
       particular area, and the DC providers have to move their VMs,
       services and data to another location in limited time.  In this
       case, active-active mechanism may cause services disruption, if
       the existing services on old VMs keep running.

   Active-active and VM migration are both useful for particular
   scenarios.  In State Migration concept, we only consider the
   scenarios where VM Migration is a better choice.


6.  Scope

   For the first stage, SAMI (StAte MIgration) only do research on and
   develop solution for Session Table migration on Firewall.  But the
   solution should be extensible to enable migration of other states
   that we may find in the future which is necessary for VM live
   migration.

   In SAMI, we require that the network, wherein VM live migration
   happens, must satisfy the basic network condition requirements raised
   by Virtualization Platform vendors.  Examples of network condition
   requirements include reasonable geographic distance, higher than
   minimum bandwidth and acceptable packet delay.  The requirements
   could vary from one Virtualization Platform vendor to another, and
   SAMI won't define the requirements.  Another important requirement is
   that the IP address of VM must be kept unchanged during VM live
   migration, but SAMI won't work on these technologies or make any
   suggestions on these technologies.  When we do research on SAMI, we
   assume there are technologies to guarantee IP address unchanged
   during VM live migration.

Internet-Draft               State Migration                    Mar 2012


   To be more specific on scope, we list some of scenarios that SAMI
   will consider.  All of these scenarios, are in scope for now, and
   revision will be made when we get further achievements during
   research.

         1) State migration within the same DC, same subnet and same
         administration domain;

         2) State migration within the same DC and same administration
         domain, but between different subnets;

         3) State migration between DCs, which is under different
         administration domains and different subnets;

   Existing IETF work should be re-used to resolve the SAMI problem as
   much as possible.  Only when there is no existing IETF work can use,
   to achieve State migration, a new mechanism needs to be developed.
   [GapAnalysis]makes a brief analysis on existing related IETF work,
   including MIDCOM, ForCES and PCP.  And more will be introduced later.


7.  Security Considerations

   The states described above are all about security.  Besides, we need
   to be careful to avoid poisoned states from untrusted source.  That
   means no matter how the states are migrated, authentication and
   verification are required.
