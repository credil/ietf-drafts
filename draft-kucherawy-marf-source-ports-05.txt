                  draft-kucherawy-marf-source-ports-05

Abstract

   This document defines an additional header field for use in Abuse
   Reporting Format reports to permit the identification of the source
   port of the connection involved in an abuse incident.

   This document updates RFC5965 and RFC6591.

Internet-Draft              ARF Source Ports                   June 2012


1.  Introduction

   [ARF] defined the Abuse Reporting Format, an extensible message
   format for Email Feedback Reports.  These reports are used to report
   incidents of email abuse.  ARF was extended by [AUTHFAILURE-REPORT]
   to enable reporting of email authentication failures.  These
   specifications provided for the source IP address to be included in a
   report.  As explained in [LOG], the deployment of IP address sharing
   techniques requires the source port values to be included in reports
   if unambiguous identification of the origin of abuse is to be
   achieved.

   This document defines an ARF reporting field to contain this
   information and provides guidance for its use.

2.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

3.  Source-Port Field Definition

   A new ARF header field called "Source-Port" is defined.  When present
   in a report, it MUST contain the client port of the TCP connection
   from which the reported message originated, corresponding to the
   Source-IP field that contains the client address of that same
   connection, thereby describing completely the origin of the abuse
   incident.

   Per, [ABNF], the formal syntax is:

     source-port = "Source-Port:" [CFWS] 1*5DIGIT [CFWS] CRLF

   "CFWS", which represents email-style comments or folding white space,
   is imported from [MAIL].

   When any report is generated that includes the "Source-IP" reporting
   field (see Section 3.2 of [ARF]), this field SHOULD also be present,
   unless the port number is unavailable.

   Use of this field is RECOMMENDED for reports generated per
   [AUTHFAILURE-REPORT] (see Section 3.1 of that document).

4.  Time Accuracy

   [LOG] underscores the importance of accurate clocks when generating
   reports that include source port information because of the fact that

Internet-Draft              ARF Source Ports                   June 2012


   source ports can be recycled very quickly in Internet Service
   Provider environments.  The same considerations described there apply
   here.

   Report generators that include an Arrival-Date report field MAY
   choose to express the value of that date in Universal Coordinated
   Time (UTC) to enable simpler correlation with local records at sites
   that are following the provisions of [LOG].

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the Feedback Report
   Header Fields registry:

   Field Name:  Source-Port

   Description:  TCP source port from which the original message was
      received

   Multiple Appearances:  No

   Related Feedback-Type:  any

   Reference:  [this document]

   Status:  current

6.  Security Considerations

   This extension introduces no new security considerations not already
   covered in [ARF].

   Some security considerations related to the general topic of source
   port logging can be found in [LOG].
