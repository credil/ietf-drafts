         RSVP-TE Extensions to Exchange MPLS-TP LSP Identifiers
           draft-zhang-ccamp-mpls-tp-rsvpte-ext-tunnel-num-02

Abstract

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) identifiers document [RFC6370]
   specifies an initial set of identifiers, such as local assigned
   tunnel number and Global_ID, which can be used to form Maintenance
   Entity Point Identifier (MEP_ID).  As to some Operation,
   Administration and Maintenance (OAM) functions, such as Connectivity
   Verification (CV) [RFC6428], source MEP_ID must be inserted in the
   OAM packets, so that the peer endpoint can compare the received and
   expected MEP_IDs to judge whether there is a mismatch [RFC6371],
   which means that the two MEP nodes need to pre-store each other's
   MEP_IDs.

   This document defines the signaling extensions to exchange the Label
   Switched Path (LSP) identifiers.

Internet-Draft   RSVP-TE Extensions for LSP Identifiers       March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) identifiers document [RFC6370]
   specifies a initial set of identifiers, such as local assigned tunnel
   number (Tunnel_Num) and Global_ID, which can be used to form
   Maintenance Entity Point Identifier (MEP_ID).  The MPLS-TP LSP_MEP_ID
   is Node_ID::Tunnel_Num::LSP_Num, and in situations where global
   uniqueness is required, this becomes: Global_ID::Node_ID::
   Tunnel_Num::LSP_Num. In order to realize some Operation,
   Administration and Maintenance (OAM) functions, such as Connectivity
   Verification (CV) [RFC6428], source MEP-ID MUST be inserted in the
   OAM packets, in this way the peer endpoint can compare the received
   and expected MEP-IDs to judge whether there is a mismatch [RFC6371].
   Hence, the two MEP nodes must pre-store each other's MEP-IDs before
   sending the CV packets.

   Obviously, the exchange of MEP_IDs can be accomplished by the Network
   Management System (NMS), but it is complex when the LSPs cross
   different adiminstration domains, which involves the cooperation of
   NMSs.  When the LSPs are set up by control plane, Resource
   ReserVation Protocol Traffic Engnieering (RSVP-TE) messages will be
   more suitable to realize the exchange of MEP_IDs.

   Since the LSP identifiers can be carried in an Extended ASSOCIATION
   object, which may also be used in a single session
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-ext], it is naturally to define the signaling
   extensions of co-routed and associated bidirectional LSP to exchange
   the LSP identifiers based on the Extended ASSOCIATION object.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Operation

3.1.  Co-routed Bidirectional LSP

   Consider that LSP1 is across different administration domains, which
   is initialized at A1 node with an Extended ASSOCIATION object
   inserted in Path message.  Association Type is set to "LSP
   Identifers", Association ID set to A1-Tunnel_Num, Association Source
   set to A1-Node_ID, Global Association Source set to A1-Global_ID, and
   the Extended Association ID field is omitted.  Upon receipt of the
   Extended Association Object, the terminating node Z9 checks the

   Association Type field.  If it is "LSP Identifiers" and an
   Upstream_Label exists in Path message, the Extended ASSOCIATION
   object must be carried in the Resv message also.  Similarly,
   Association Type is set to "LSP Identifiers", Association ID set to
   Z9-Tunnel_Num, Association Source set to Z9-Node_ID, Global
   Association Source set to Z9-Global_ID, and the Extended Association
   ID field is omitted.

3.2.  Associated Bidirectional LSP

   The document [I-D.ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-rsvpte-ext-associated-lsp]
   discusses the provisioning models and signaling procedures of
   associated bidirectional LSPs.  Consider the example provided there,
   when LSP1 and LSP2 are bound together to be an associated
   bidirectional LSP which is across several administration domains, the
   global ID filled in the Extended Association objects with Association
   Type set to "Double Sided Associated Bidirectional LSP" or "Single
   Sided Associated Bidirectional LSP" is A-Global_ID or B-Global_ID.
   If it is A-Global_ID, node A still does know the global ID of node B
   in case that LSP1 and LSP2 are across several administration domains.
   Since multiple Association objects have always been supported in Path
   messages, an Extended Association object with Asssociation Type "LSP
   Identifiers" can be inserted in the Path messages of associated
   bidirectional LSPs to let the terminating nodes exchange each others
   LSP identifiers.

   If double sided provisioning model is used, the values of an Extended
   Association object in LSP1's Path message are set as below :
   Association Type set to "LSP Identifiers", Association ID set to
   A-Tunnel_Num, Association Source set to A-Node_ID, Global Association
   Source set to A-Global_ID, and the Extended Association ID field
   omitted; the object in LSP2's Path message are set similarly :
   Association Type is set to "LSP Identifiers", Association ID set to
   B-Tunnel_Num, Association Source set to B-Node_ID, Global Association
   Source set to B-Global_ID, and the Extended Association ID field
   omitted.  While in case that single sided provisioning model is
   adopted, in the initialized LSP1's Path message, the values of an
   Extended Association object are set as following: Association Type
   set to "LSP Identifiers", Association ID set to A-Tunnel_Num,
   Association Source set to A-Node_ID, Global Association Source set to
   A-Global_ID, and the Extended Association ID field omitted.  When
   node B receives this Path message, LSP2 is triggered to be
   established by the received Extended ASSOCIATION objects with the
   Association Type "Single Sided Associated Bidirectional LSPs" and
   "LSP Identifiers".  The Extended Association Object with Association
   Type "LSP Identifiers" inserted in LSP2's Path message is like:
   Association ID set to B-Tunnel_Num, Association Source set to
   B-Node_ID, Global Association Source set to B-Global_ID, and the

   Extended Association ID field omitted.


4.  RSVP-TE Extensions

4.1.  Association Type

   Within the current document, a new Association Type is defined in the
   Extended ASSOCIATION object.


   Value      Type
   -----      -----
   6 (TBD)    LSP Identifiers (L)


   See [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-ext] for the definition of other fields and
   values.

   The rules associated with the processing of the Extended ASSOCIATION
   objects in RSVP message are discussed in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-ext].
   It said that in the absence of Association Type-specific rules for
   identifying association, the included Extended ASSOCIATION objects
   MUST be identical.  Since the Association Type "LSP Identifiers" used
   here is to carry LSP identifier, there is no need to associate Path
   state to Path state or Resv state to Resv state, one specific rule is
   added: when the Association Type is "LSP Identifiers", the Extended
   ASSOCIATION object can appear in Path or Resv message across sessions
   or in a single session, and the values can be different.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to administer assignment of new values for
   namespace defined in this document and summarized in this section.

   One bit ("LSP Identifers") needs to be allocated in the Association
   Type Registry.


6.  Security Considerations

   A new Association Type is defined in this document, and except this,
   there are no security issues about the Extended ASSOCIATION object
   are introduced here.  For Association object related security issues,
   see the documents [RFC4872], [RFC4873], and
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-ext].
