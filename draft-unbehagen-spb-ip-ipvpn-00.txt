Abstract

      This document describes a compact method of using a IEEE 802.1aq  
   Shortest Path Backbone Bridging (SPB) network to natively enable and
   carry IP and IPVPN services on native Ethernet links.  Further this
   documents the extensions to SPB's control protocol, IS-IS, required
   to allow it to be a single mechanism for providing all these services
   types.  On its own SPB provides virtual Ethernet networks; utilizing
   IS-IS to create loop free Ethernet topologies that forward Ethernet
   traffic using a standard Ethernet header.  This document shows how
   the same SPB network can also be leveraged to provide IP based
   services.

INTERNET DRAFT                   IP/SPB                    March 5, 2012


1  Introduction

   The IEEE has defined a method for L2 virtualization called Shortest
   Path Bridging (SPB), which is leveraging IS-IS as a new Ethernet
   control plane to control the BMAC layer of the 802.1ah PBB
   encapsulation, replacing Ethernet's flooding and learning as the
   backbone forwarding protocol. In addition to layer 2 (bridging), the
   24 bits of the Service Instance defined in the 802.1ah frame format
   can also be leveraged for any network connectivity service including
   layer 3 Unicast and Multicast for IPv4 and IPv6. This document
   outlines the proposed extensions to ISIS-SPB to enable this
   functionality. The benefits of leveraging one protocol (ISIS-SPB) to
   provide any type of connectivity service on top of Ethernet are
   significant.

   SPB, through the use of ISIS to exchange the connectivity service
   topology, provides a powerful end-point-only provisioning model.
   IP/SPB leverages this and extends this to Layer 3, thus not only L2
   VPNs can be formed by attaching Virtual LANs to service IDs (ISIDs),
   but also L3 VPNs can be formed by binding Virtual Route Forwarders
   (VRFs) to ISIDs at the service attachment points.

   Due to the fact that all connectivity services described above are
   using the same SPB forwarding plane defined in IEEE802.1aq/.1Qbp,
   network availability is defined by the convergence timing of the
   single ISIS-SPB control plane.

2.  SPB control of BMAC forwarding

   SPB uses the terms Backbone Core Bridge (BCB) and Backbone Edge
   Bridge (BEB) to describe the functions of network nodes in the
   network.  These terms describe features that are similar in function
   to the PE and P nodes in an MPLS network.

   SPB enables a loop free construction of Ethernet switched paths
   between every SPB enabled node by reusing some existing components of
   IS-IS and by adding a small set of new IS-IS TLVs. SPB nodes use a
   standard IS-IS mechanism of operation for neighbor discovery and
   database distribution.  SPB utilizes an IS-IS based on IS-IS Ethernet
   link level peering protocol so it does not depend on link level IP
   addressing.  Also, due to the fact that the links are forwarding on
   the source and destination information in the Ethernet header, there
   is no requirement to verify that each node can do IP routing. 
   Multicast Forwarding entries (BMAC FDB or FIB) on each node are
   constructed based on a combination of a nodal unique identifier and a
   administratively controlled service identifier providing multicast
   trees that can be adjusted to match a desired service granularity.

   Each node uses standard IS-IS methods of sharing link state PDU's.
   Those PDUs contain the System-ID of each node, the attached neighbors
     and information such as EVPN ISIDs for SPB.  A unicast SPF process
   runs on each switch to construct the unicast connectivity of each

   switch to every other switch based on these nodal MAC's (BMACs)  
   derived from the System-ID.  Each node that is on the shortest path
   between any other given nodes will install corresponding FDB entries
   only on their associated ports.  This has the added benefit that
   Ethernet FDB entries exist only on nodes that are the source, root,
   or tandem point for a give SPF ESP between any given set of nodes. 
   Any node that does not need to participate in the tandem calculations
   may use the IS-IS overload bit to exclude tandem paths and behave as
   only the root or source for any given service traffic.

3. IP forwarding with SPB

   IP unicast and multicast can leverage this base BMAC switching layer
   by mapping IP to the Ethernet service points. For unicast forwarding
   the standard mechanisms of IS-IS IP route propagation can be used to
   associate remote IP networks to the far end nodal Ethernet address.  

   The encapsulation of IP unicast packets would use the standard method
   to include an Ethertype of 0x800 behind the BMAC header.


      Packets received       Packets in transit      Packets forwarded
      at ingress BEB          in the network          by egress BEB

      +============+          +=============+         +============+
      |  IP Header |          |   IP Header |         |  IP Header |
      +============+   >>>>>  +=============+  >>>>>  +============+
      |    C-MAC   |          |    B-MAC    |         |    C-MAC   |
      +============+          +=============+         +============+


3.1. IP Unicast

   The native unicast entries SPB constructs, provide a simple way of
   enabling end to end switching of IP packets along a deterministic
   Ethernet Switched Path (ESP).  Knowledge of the location of IP
   subnet's is achieved by utilizing the existing functionality of IS-IS
   TLVs for IPv4 and IPv6. The control plane operation becomes one of
   simply creating FDB entries that map IP routes to their points of
   presence. In other words the FDB entry for an IP route simply gives
   the last hop BMAC of the BEB which advertised that route. No shortest
   path computations are required since that has already been
   accomplished by the SPB layer. For IP subnet awareness the existing
   IS-IS TLVs are used to propagate routes. The encapsulation is the
   standard IP in Ethernet encapsulation.

   To enable this behavior, this document specifies an efficient
   learning and forwarding operation where an edge BEB provides a

   standard IP interface to its attached IP devices.  The BEB performs a
   route lookup on the destination IP addresses which will resolve to a
   remote BMAC to forward towards on the SPB portion of the network, and
   then encapsulates the IP packet in a Ethernet header using the
   unicast BMAC operation with a standard IPv4 or IPv6 Ethertype. In
   essence this is IP over Ethernet where the Ethernet is a BMAC based
   Ethernet. One simple way to think of this is that existing ISIS for
   IP implementations forward IP packets to the next hop router, while
   this mechanism forwards an IP packet directly to the last hop BEB
   within the SPB domain thereby eliminating IP forwarding operations on
   tandem devices.

4. IPVPN services with SPB

   Using the TLV extensions described below it is possible to extend SPB
   to not only provide EVPN and the above described IP connectivity, but
   also provide virtualized solutions for IP services such as IPVPNs.
   The next sections will outline the route propagation techniques for
   two different deployment models.

   Two common modes of carrying information are: BGP or ISIS [ISIS]. 
   The IS-IS method will be described in this version of the draft.  The
   control plane encapsulation of VRF routes passed in BGP is similar to
   the method used here with ISIS.

4.1. Route Propagation Techniques

   The ability to share routes within a network can be provided within
   IS-IS.  To accomplish this flexibility the use of a new IPVPN TLV and
   an optional sub-TLV is proposed.

   on the combination of bits set to 1.  If neither the T nor R bit is

   set, then the IPVPN service is unicast only. The next 4 bits are
   reserved and the S bit is used to signify that the VPN-Route Sub-TLVs
   are present. 

   Sub-TLVs may be set to carry specific routes for each VPN within IS-
   IS.  This allows for routes from multiple VPNs to be carried under
   their respective VPN ISID IDs and allow for overlapping IP subnet's.

   IP/SPB VPN ISIDs are comparable to RFC4364 Route distinguishers and
   route targets to separate VPN traffic in the control plane. VPN
   routes are exchanged through IS-IS and can be distinguished by the
   individual ISID they are associated with.  In order to form different
   types of IP VPNs on BEB's, routes can be exported into ISID's or
   imported from ISID's.

   This document also defines the following new sub-TLV types that need
   to be reflected in the IS-IS sub-TLV registry for the SPB ipvpn TLV:

               Sub-Type        Description
               -------     ------------------------------
                  1        IPv4 Prefix information
                  2        IPv6 Prefix information
                  3	   Reserved
                  4 	   Reserved


   The encapsulation is as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3

4.2. Ethernet underlay modes - 802.1aq and/or 802.1Qbp

   Shortest Path Bridging supports two major modes for L2VPNs via
   802.1aq [SPB] and 802.1Qbp [ECMP] the behaviors of which may be
   selected on a per ISID basis for carriage of L3VPNs as follows.

   The 802.1aq [SPB] L2 underlay on which IPVPN packets flow, supports
   deterministic and symmetric multiple equal cost routes with hashing
   to the different routes at the head end via normal IP n-tuple or
   other micro flow order preserving hash mechanisms. To obtain this
   behavior the IPVPN TLV VID field MUST contain a BVID value which has
   been associated with one of the 802.1aq ECT-ALGORITHMS by the SPB
   underlay in the SPB Base VLAN-Identifiers sub-TLV. This will cause
   the ISID information which follows to have 802.1aq semantics - i.e.
   (S,G) multicast and symmetric/congruent routing. The normal 802.1aq
   ECT-ALGORITHM values 00-80-C2-01 thru 00-80-C2-10 and their
   associated VIDs are advertised normally in the IIH and LSPs for
   802.1aq and the head end IPVPN behavior is free to hash over any or
   all of those VIDs.

   The 802.1Qbp [ECMP] extensions to [SPB] supports a flow-tag with a
   FlowId and TTL resulting in a per hop hashed choice of next hop by L2
   forwarding. To obtain this behavior the IPVPN TLV VID field MUST
   contain a BVID value which has been associated with one of the
   802.1Qbp ECT-ALGORITHMS by the SPB underlay in the SPB Base VLAN-
   Identifiers sub-TLV.  This will cause the ISID information which
   follows to have 802.1Qbp semantics - i.e. (*,G) and/or (S,G)
   multicast and non deterministic non symmetric routing. The normal
   802.1Qbp ECT-ALGORITHM value 00-80-C2-11 and its associated VIDs are
   advertised normally in the IIH and LSPs for 802.1Qbp and the head end
   IPVPN behavior is free to hash over all ECMP L2 next hops for this
   VID and to insert a flow-tag with appropriate TTL value and FlowId
   based on the L3 hash result. The TTL and FlowId will then be used to
   enable tandem .1Qbp ECMP behavior without knowledge of or inspection
   of the L3VPN headers.

4.3. I-TAG Encapsulation

   For the forwarding of IPVPN traffic the use of the standard 802.1ah
   I-TAG would require the encapsulation of a nulled out CMAC address,
   since the traffic is IP and routed at each BEB there is no need for a
   CMAC. Therefore the more optimal encapsulated method used for IPVPN
   traffic within the SPB network is to use the ISID portion of the I-
   TAG without a CMAC header, called the short I-TAG.  This allows the
   network to carry forward the benefits of the global label/VPN ID
   purpose of the ISID without enforcing unnecessary header overhead.

   The encapsulation of IP packets being forwarded for a IPVPN would use
   a short I-Tag (ISID with no CMAC) behind the BMAC header. While the
   short I-TAG is the recommended mode for carrying IPVPN traffic this
   standard permits the inclusion of a zerod out CMAC. In this case the
   sender MUST zero out the CMAC on transmission and MUST ignore a non-
   zero CMAC on receipt.

5. Interworking with MPLS based Networks

   Any IP/SPB and/or IPVPN SPB network may exist on its own or may be
   part of a larger network.  For example it may be attached to a
   standard IP or IP/MPLS network.  This section will define a use case
   for using an SPB base network as a method of extending IPVPNs from a
   IP/MPLS core network. A similar model exists for the ELAN service
   that may span both a SPB and VPLS portions of the network as defined
   in [PBBVPLS] The scale and size of the SPB portion of the network and
   network devices can then be utilized more efficiently as a single
   protocol will drain less resources and thereby allow the IPVPN VRFs
   extend closer to the end customer.  Another benefit is that packets
   that are destined within the SPB network can be forwarded directly in
   the SPB portion of the domain without needing to be processed by the
   MPLS PE.

   A vrf does Service Address Encapsulation on a VPN basis with some
   entries of the VRF having MPLS labels and some have IPVPN SPB entries
   based on the direction from which the route was learned. The VRF also
   gets information from different topologies.  Routes learned via BGP
   have FIB entries pointing to the appropriate next hop and Label set. 
   While routes learned from the IPVPN ISID SPB domain have FDB entries
   for the appropriate BMAC address and ISID.

   Route propagation to and from each domain happens naturally via the
   protocol interaction within a given VRF.  Routes learned from the SPB
   domain are automatically announced into the BGP domain or may have
   policies applied and routes learned from other PE's from BGP are
   automatically propagated towards the CE's by injecting them into the
   SPB domain as a sub-TLV under the VRF's IPVPN ISID TLV.

6. OAM

   Various techniques exist within the Ethernet standards space for
   scalable management of Ethernet based networks. For example OAM
   techniques defined in the IEEE 802.ag and the ITU Y.1731 can be used
   for the IP based services similarly as they are defined for the EVPNs

7. Security Considerations

   The extensions defined in this document do not incur any additional
   security considerations. Any IS-IS SPB network may utilize the
   security enhancements already defined within the IS-IS working group.


8. IANA Considerations

   IP/SPB requires that IANA/ISO allocate a new number from ISIS-TLV
   Codepoints for the IPVPN TLV.

   IP/SPB also requires that IANA/ISO allocate a new registry for sub
   TLV values within the above TLV. The first four values being:      1
   IPV4      2 IPV6      3 reserved      4 reserved
