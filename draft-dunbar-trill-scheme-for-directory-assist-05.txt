1. Introduction

   [DirectoryFramework] describes a high level framework for using
   directory servers to assist TRILL [RFC6325] edge nodes to reduce
   multi-destination ARP/ND and unknown unicast flooding traffic and to
   potentially improve security aginst address spoofing within a TRILL
   comapus.  Because multi-destination traffic becomes an increasing
   burden as a network scales, reducing ARP/ND and unknown unicast
   flooding improves TRILL network scalability. This document describes
   specific mechanisms for directory servers to assist TRILL edge nodes.
   These mechanims are optional to implement.

   The information held by the directories is address mapping
   information.  Most commonly, what MAC address [RFC5342bis]
   corresponds to an IP address within a Data Label (VLAN or FGL (Fine
   Grained Label [RFCfgl])) and what egress TRILL switch (RBridge) that
   MAC address is attached to. But it could be what IP address
   corresponds to a MAC address or possibly other mappings. In the data
   center environment, it is common for orchestration software to know
   and control where all the IP addresses, MAC address, and
   VLANs/tenants are. Thus such orchestration software is appropriate
   for providing the directory function or for supplying the
   Directory(s) with information they need.

   Directory services can be offered in a Push or Pull mode. Push mode,
   in which a directory server pushes information to RBridges indicating
   interest, is specified in Section 2. Pull mode, in which an RBridge
   queries a server for the information it wants, is specified in
   Section 3. Modes of operation including hybrid Push/Pull are
   discussed in Section 4.

   The mechanisms used to keep the mappings held by different
   Directories synchronized is beyond the scope of this document.



1.1 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   The terminology and acronyms of [RFC6325] are used herein along with
   the following additional acronyms and terms:

   Data Label: VLAN or FGL.

   FGL:  Fine Grained Label [RFCfgl].

   Host: Application running on a physical server or a virtual machine.


L. Dunbar, et al                                                [Page 3]

         A host must have a MAC address and usually has at least one IP
         address.

   IP:   Internet Protocol. In this document, IP includes both IPv4 and
         IPv6.

   RBridge: An alternative name for a TRILL switch.

   TRILL switch: An alternative name for an RBridge.



1.2 Circumstances Causing Directory Use

   An RBridge can consult Directory information whenever it wants, by
   searching through information it has because that information has
   been pushed to it or pulled by it and retained or by requesting
   information from a pull directory. However, the following are
   expected to be the most common circumstances leading to directory
   use. All of these are cases of ingressing a native frame.

      o  Ingressing a native frame with an unknown unicast destination
         MAC. The mapping from the destination MAC and Data Label to its
         egress RBridge of attachment is needed to ingress the frame as
         unicast. If the egress RBridge is unknown, the frame must be
         dropped or ingressed as a multi-destination frame and flooded
         to all edge RBridges for its Data Label.

      o  Ingressing an ARP [RFC826]. ARP is a very flexible protocol but
         is primarily used on a link to query for the MAC address
         corresponding to an IPv4 address, test if an IPv4 address is in
         use, or to announce a change in any of IPv4 address, MAC
         address, and point of attachment. ... more TBD ...

      o  Ingressing a ND [RFC903]. ...TBD... Secure Neighbor Discovery
         messages [RFC3971] will, in general, have to be sent to the
         neighbor intended so that neighbor can sign the answer;
         however, directory information can be used to unicast a Secure
         Neighbor Discovery packet rather than multicasting it.

      o  Ingressing a RARP [RFC4861]. ...TBD...

   Any of the above could be cause for an ingress RBridge to consult
   Directory information that has been pushed to it, to send a pull
   request to a Pull Directory, or both.

2. Push Model Directory Assistance Mechanisms

   In the Push Model, Push Directory servers push down the mapping
   information for the various addresses of end stations in some Data
   Label.  A Push Directory advertises whether or not it believes it is
   pushing complete mapping information for a Data Label. The Push Model
   uses the [ESADI] protocol.

   With this model, it is RECOMMENDED that complete address mapping
   information for a Data Label be pushed and that a participating
   RBridge simply drop a data packet, instead of flooding the packet, if
   the destination unicast MAC address is in a Data Label being pushed
   and can't be found in the address mapping information available. This
   will minimize flooding of packets due to errors or inconsistencies
   but is not practical if directories have incomplete information.



2.1 Requesting Push Service

   In the Push Model, it is necessary to have a way for an RBridge to
   request information from the directory server(s).  RBridges simply
   use the ESADI protocol mechanism to announce, in the IS-IS link state
   database, all the Data Labels for which they are participating in
   [ESADI]. They are then pushed the mapping information for all such
   Data Labels being served by a Push Directory server.



2.2 Push Directory Servers

   Push Directory servers advertise their availability to push the
   mapping information for a particular Data Label to ESADI participants
   for that Data Label by turning on a flag bit in their ESADI Parameter
   APPsub-TLV [ESADI] (see Section 7.1) for athat ESADI instance.

   Each Push Directory server MUST participate in ESADI for the Data
   Labels for which it can push mappings and set the PD bit in their
   ESADI-Parameters APPsub-TLV for that Data Label.



2.3 Multiple Push Directory Servers

   For robustness, it is useful to have more than one copy of the data
   being pushed. Each RBridge that is a Push Directory server is
   configured with a number in the range 1 to 8, which defaults to 2 for
   each Data Label for which it can push directory information. This is
   the number of copies of the directory it believes should be pushed.



L. Dunbar, et al                                                [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT                        TRILL: Directory Assist Mechanisms


   Each Push Directory server also has an 8-bit priority to be active
   (see Section 6.1 of this document). This priority is treated as an
   unsigned integer where larger mangitude means higher priority and is
   in its ESADI Parameter APPsub-TLV. In cases of equal priority, the
   6-byte IS-IS System ID is used as a tie breaker and treated as an
   unsigned integer where larger magnitude means higher priority.

   For each Data Label it can serve, each Push Directory RBridge server
   orders the Push Directory servers that it can see as data reachable
   [RFCclear] in the ESADI link state database for that Data Label and
   determines its position in that order. If a Push Directory server
   believes that N copies of the mappings for a Data Label should be
   pushed and finds that it is first in priority or, more generally,
   equal to or higher than Nth in priority, it is Active. If it finds
   that it is N+1st or lower in priority, it is Passive.

   For example, assume four Push Directory servers for Data Label X:
   server A with priority 123 configured to believe there should be 2
   copies pushed; server B, priority 88, 1 copy; server C, priority 40,
   3 copies; and server D, priority 7, 2 copies. Server A, seeing that
   is highest priority, is Active. Server B, seeing that it is 2nd
   highest priority and believing that only 1 copy should be pushed, is
   Passive. Server C sees that it is 3rd highest priority and believes 3
   copies should be pushed, so it is Active. And server D sees it is 4th
   highest priority and, believing that only 2 copies should be pushed,
   is Passive.

   If a Push Directory server is Active for Data Label X, it includes
   the Data Label X directory mappings it has in its ESADI-LSP for Data
   Label X and updates that information as the mappings it knows change.
   If the Push Directory server is configured to believe it has complete
   mapping information for Data Label X then, after it first actually
   transmits all of its ESADI-LSPs for X it then waits its CSNP time
   (see Section 6.1 of [ESADI]), and then updates its ESADI-Parameters
   APPsub-TLV to set the Complete Push (CP) bit to one. This change will
   cause its EASDI fragment zero to be flooded. It then maintains the CP
   bit as one as long as it is Active.

   If a Push Directory server is Passive for Data Label X, it removes or
   continues to leave out all Data Label X directory mappings it holds
   from its ESADI-LSP for Data Label X. However, if it was Active and
   was advertising the CP bit as one in its ESADI-Parameters APPsub-TLV,
   it first updates the CP bit to zero and floods its updated ESADI-LSP
   fragment zero. Its then waits its CSNP time before withdrawing all
   its directory mapping information.

INTERNET-DRAFT                        TRILL: Directory Assist Mechanisms


2.3 Additional Push Details

   Push Directory mappings can be distinguished for any other data
   distributed through ESADI because mappings are distributed only with
   the Interface Addresses APPsub-TLV [IA] and are flagged as being Push
   Directory data.

   RBridges, whether or not they are a Push Directory server, MAY
   continue to advertise any locally learned MAC attachment information
   in [ESADI] using the Reachable MAC Addresses TLV [RFC6165]. However,
   if a Data Label is being served by complete Push Directory servers,
   advertising such locally learned MAC attachment would generally not
   be done as it should not add anything and would just waste bandwidth
   and ESADI link state space. An exception would be when an RBridge
   learns local MAC connectivity and that information appears to be
   missing from the directory mapping.

   Because a Push Directory server may need to advertise interest in
   Data Labels even though it does not want to receive user data in
   those Data Labels, the No Data flag bit is provided as discussed in
   Section 6.3.

   If an RBridge notices that a Push Directory server is no longer data
   reachable [RFCclear], it MUST ignore any Push Directory data from
   that server because it is no longer being updated and may be stale.

   There may be transient conflicts between mapping information from
   different Push Directory servers or conflicts between locally learned
   information and information received from a Push Directory server. In
   case of such conflicts, information with a higher confidence value is
   preferred over information with a lower confidence. In case of equal
   confidence, Push Directory information is preferred to locally
   learned information and if information from Push Directory servers
   conflicts, the information from the higher priority Push Directory
   server is preferred.

3. Pull Model Directory Assistance Mechanisms

   In the Pull Model, an RBridge pulls mapping information from an
   appropriate Directory Server when needed.

   Pull Directory servers for a particular Data Label X are located by
   looking in the main TRILL IS-IS link state database for RBridges that
   advertise themselves by having the Pull Directory flag on in their
   Interested VLANs or Interested Labels sub-TLV [RFC6326bis] for X. If
   multiple RBridges indicate that they are Pull Directory Servers for a
   particular Data Label, a pull request can be sent to any of them that
   is data reachable but it is RECOMMENDED that pull requests be sent to
   server that is least cost from the requesting RBridge.

   Pull Directory requests are sent by enclosing them in an RBridge
   Channel [Channel] message using the Pull Directory channel protocol
   number (see Section 6.2).  Responses are returned in an RBridge
   Channel message using the same channel protocol number.

   The requests to Pull Directory Servers are derived from normal ARP
   [RFC826], ND [RFC4861], RARP [RFC903] messages or data frames with
   unknown unicast destination MAC addresses intercepted by the RBridge
   when they would otherwise be ingressed.  Pull Directory responses
   include an amount of time for which the response should be considered
   valid. This includes negative responses that indicate no data is
   available. Thus both positive responses with data and negative
   responses can be cached and used for immediate response to ARP, ND,
   RARP, or unknown destination MAC frames, until they expire.  If
   information previously pulled is about to expire, an RBridge MAY try
   to refresh it by issued a new pull request but, to avoid unnecessary
   requests, SHOULD NOT do so if it has not been recently used.



3.1 Pull Directory Request Format

   A Pull Directory request is sent as the Channel Protocol specific
   content of an inter-RBridge Channel message TRILL Data packet. The
   Data Label in the packet is the Data Label in which the query is
   being made. The priority of the channel message is a mapping of the
   priority of the frame being ingressed that caused the request with
   the default mapping depending, per Data Label, on the strategy (see
   Section 4). The Channel Protocol specific data is formatted as
   follows:

         SIZE: Size of the query data in bytes as an unsigned byt
            starting with and including the SIZE fiel itself. Thus the
            minimium legal value is 2. A value of SIZE less than
            indicates a malformed message. The "QUERY" with the illegal
            SIZE value and all subsequent QUERYs MUST be ignored and the
            entire query message MAY be ignored.

         RESV: A block of reserved bits. MUST be sent as zero and
            ignored on receipt.

         TYPE: There are two types of queries currently defines, (1) a
            query that provides an explicit address and asks for other
            addresses for the interface specified by the query address
            and (2) a query frame. The fields of each are specified
            below. Values of TYPE are as follows

                  TYPE   Description
                  ----   -----------
                     0    reserved
                     1    query address
                     2    ARP query frame
                     3    ND query frame
                     4    RARP query frame
                     5    Unknown unicast MAC query frame
                  6-14    assignable by IETF Review
                    15    reserved

            AFN: Address Family Number of the query address.

            Address: This is the query address. The query is asking for
               any other addresses that correspond to the same interface
               within the data label of the query and the RBridge from
               which they are reachable. Typically that would be either
               (1) a MAC address, in which case the querying RBridge is
               interested in the RBridge by which that MAC address is
               reachable, or (2) an IP address, in which case the
               querying RBridge is interested in the corresponding MAC
               address and the RBridge by which that MAC address is
               reachable.

            Query Frame: Where a Pull Directroy query is the result of
               an ARP, ND, RARP, or unkown unicast MAC destination
               address, the ingress RBridge MAY send the frame to a Pull
               Directory Server if the frame is small enough to fit into
               a query message. This avoids the requirement that the
               ingress RBridge hold the frame pending a Pull Directory
               response.

   A query count of zero is explicitly allowed, for the purpose of
   pinging a Pull Directory server to see if it is responding to


L. Dunbar, et al                                               [Page 10]

   requests. On receipt of such an empty query messgea, a response
   message that also has a count of zero MUST be sent.

   If no response is received to a Pull Directory request within a
   configurable timeout, the request should be re-transmitted with the
   same Sequence Number up to a configurable number of times that
   defaults to three. If there are multiple queries in a request,
   responses can be received to various subsets of these queries by the
   timeout. In that case, the remaining unanswered queries should be re-
   sent in a new query with a new sequence number.  If an RBridge is not
   capable of handling partial responses to requests with multiple
   queries, it MUST NOT sent a request with more than one query in it.



3.2 Pull Directory Response Format

   Pull Directory responses are sent as the Channel Protocol specific
   content of inter-RBridge Channel message TRILL Data packets.
   Responses are sent with the same Data Label and priority as the
   request to which they correspond except that the response priority is
   limited. This priority limit is configurable at a per RBridge level
   and defaults to priority 6. The Channel protocol specific data format
   is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      V: Version of the Pull Directory protocol. Version zero is
         specified in this document.

      T: Type. 0 => Response, 1=> Query, 2=> Unsolicited Update, 3=>
         Reserved. An unsolicited update is formated as a response
         except there was no corresponding query. Unsolicited responses
         are sent to maintain cache consistency (see Section 3.5).
         Messages received with type = 3 are discarded.

      F: The Flood bit. If zero, the reply is to be unicast to the
         provided Nickname. If T=2, F=1 is used to flood messages for
         certain unsolicited cache consistency maintenance messages from
         an end station Pull Directory server as discussed in Section
         3.5. If T is not 2, F is ignored.

         P, N: Flags used in connection with certain flooded unsolicited
         cache consistency maintenance messages. Ignored if T is not 2.
         If the P bit is a one, the solicited response message relates
         to cached positive response information. If the N bit is a one,
         the unsolicited messages related to cached negative
         information. See Section 3.5.

      RESV: Reserved bits. MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

      Count: Count is the number of responses present in the particular
         reponse message.

      ERR, subERR: A two part error code. See Section 3.4.

      Sequence Number: An opaque 32-bit quantity set by the requesting
         RBridge and copied by the Pull Directory into all responses to
         the query. For an unsolicited "response", the contents are
         unspecified.

      RESPONSE: Each response record within a Pull Directory response
         message is formatted as follows:

           0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
         |         SIZE          |   RESV    |   Index   |
         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
         |                   Lifetime                    |
         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
         |                Response Data ...
         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--...

         SIZE: Size of the response data in bytes starting with and
            including the SIZE field itself.

         RESV: Four reserved bits that MUST be sent as zero and ignored
            on receipt.

         Index: The relative index of the query in the request message
            to which this response corresponds. The index will always be
            one for request messages containing a single query. The
            index will always be zero for unsolicited "response"
            messages.

         Lifetime: The length of time for which the response should be


L. Dunbar, et al                                               [Page 12]

INTERNET-DRAFT                        TRILL: Directory Assist Mechanisms


            considered valid in seconds.

         Response Data: There are two types of response data. If the ERR
            field is non-zero, the response data is a copy of the query
            data, that is, an AFN followed by an address. If the ERR
            field is zero, the response data is the contents of an
            Interface Addresses APPsub-TLV (see Section 5) without the
            usual TRILL GENINFO TLV type and length and without the
            usual IA APPsub-TLV type and length before it.

   Multiple response records can appear in a response message with the
   same index if the answer to a query consists of multiple Interface
   Address APPsub-TLV contents. This would be necessary if, for example,
   a MAC address within a Data Label appears to be reachable by multiple
   RBridges.

   All response records to any particular query record MUST occur in the
   same response message. If a Pull Directory holds more mappings for a
   queried address than will fit into one response message, it selects
   which to include by some method outside the scope of this document.

   See Section 3.4 for a discussion of how errors are handled.



3.3 Pull Directory Hosted on an End Station

   Optionally, a Pull Directory actually hosted on an end station MAY be
   supported. In that case, when the RBridge advertising itself as a
   Pull Directory server receives a query, it modifies the inter-RBridge
   Channel message received into a native RBridge Channel message and
   forwards it to that end station. Later, when it receives one or more
   responses from that end station by native RBridge Channel messages,
   it modifies them into inter-RBridge Channel messages and forwards
   them to the source RBridge of the query.

   The native RBridge Channel Pull Directory messages use the same
   Channel protocol number as do the inter-RBridge Pull Directory
   Channel messages. The native messages MUST be sent with an Outer.VLAN
   tag which gives the priority of each message which is the priority of
   the original inter-RBridge request packet. The Outer.VLAN ID used is
   the Designated VLAN on the link.

   The native RBridge Channel message protocol dependent data for a Pull
   Directory query is formatted as follows:

         format is the same as it appears right after the Inner.MacSA in
         TRILL Data messages.

      Nickname: The nickname of the destination RBridge or, if F=1,
         ignored.

      All other fields are as specified in Section 3.2.



3.4 Pull Directory Request Errors

   An error response message is indicated by a non-zero ERR field.

   If there is an error that applies to the entire request message or
   its header, as indicated by the range of the value of the ERR field,
   then the query records in the request are just expanded with a zero
   Lifetime and the insertion of the Index field echoed back in the
   response records.

   If errors occur at the query level, they MUST be reported in a
   response message separate from the results of any successful queries.
   If multiple queries in a request have different errors, they MUST be
   reported in separate response messages. If multiple queries in a
   request have the same error, this error response MAY be reported in
   one response message.

   In an error response message, the query or queries being responded to
   appear, expanded by the Lifetime for which the server thinks the
   error might persist and with their Index inserted, as the response
   record.

   ERR values 1 through 63 are available for encoding request message
   level errors. ERR values 64 through 255 are available for encoding
   query level errors. the SubErr field is available for providing more
   detail on errors. The meaning of a SubErr field value depends on the
   value of the ERR field.

3.5 Cache Consistency

   Pull Directories MUST take action to minimize the amount of time that
   an RBridge will continue to use stale information from the Pull
   Directory.

   A Pull Directory server MUST maintain one of the following, in order
   of increasing specificity.

      1. An overall record per Data Label of when the last returned
         query data will expire at a requestor and when the last query
         record specific negative response will expire.

      2. For each unit of data (IA APPsub-TLV Address Set) held by the
         server and each address about which a negative response was
         sent, when the last expected response with that unit or
         negative response will expire at a requester.

      3. For each unit of data held by the server and each address about
         which a negative response was sent, a list of RBridges that
         were sent that unit as the response or sent a negative response
         to the address, with the expected time to expiration at each of
         them.

   A Pull Directory server may have a limit as to how many RBridges it
   can maintain expiry information for by method 3 above or how many
   data units or addresses it can maintain expiry information for by
   method 2. If such limits are exceeded, it MUST transition to a lower
   numbered strategy but, in all cases, MUST support, at a minimum,
   method 1.

   When data at a Pull Directory changes or is deleted or data is added


L. Dunbar, et al                                               [Page 16]

INTERNET-DRAFT                        TRILL: Directory Assist Mechanisms


   and there may be unexpired stale information at a querying RBridge,
   the Pull Directory MUST send an unsolicited message as discussed
   below.

   If method 1, the most crude method, is being followed, then when any
   information in a Data Label is changed or deleted or an additional
   administrative Pull Directory access restriction imposed, and there
   are outstanding cached positive query data response(s), an all-
   addresses flush positive message is flooded (multicast) within that
   Data Label. And if data is added or an administrative restriction is
   removed and there are outstanding cached negative responses, an all-
   addresses flush negative message is flooded. "All-addresses" is
   indicated by the Count in an unsolicited response being zero. On
   receiving an all-addresses flooded flush positive message from a Pull
   Directory server it has used, indicated by the U, F, and P bits being
   one, an RBridge discards all cached data responses it has for that
   Data Label. Similarly, on receiving an all addresses flush negative
   message, indicated by the U, F, and N bits being one, it discards all
   cached negative responses for that Data Label. A combined flush
   positive and negative can be flooded by having all of the U, F, P,
   and N bits set to one resulting in the discard of all positive and
   negative cached information for the Data Label.

   If method 2 is being followed, then an RBridge floods address
   specific update positive unsolicited responses when data which is
   cached by a querying RBridge is changed or deleted or an
   administrative restriction is added to such data and floods an
   address specific update negative unsolicited responses when such
   information is deleted or an administrative restriction is removed
   from such data. Such messages are similar to the method 1 flooded
   unsolicited flush messages. The U and F bits will be one and the
   message will be multicast. However that Count field will be non-zero
   and either the P or N bit, but not both, will be one. On receiving
   such as address specific message, if it is positive the addresses in
   the response records in the unsolicited response are compared to the
   addresses about which the recipient RBridge is holding cached
   positive information and, if they match, the cached information is
   updated and its remaining cache life set to the minimum of its
   previous value in the cache and the Lifetime value in the unsolicited
   response. In the case of a newly imposed administrative restriction,
   the Lifetime in the unsolicited response is set to zero so the cached
   information immediately expired. On receiving an address specific
   unsolicited negative response, the addresses in the response records
   in the unsolicited response are compared to the addresses about which
   the recipient RBridge is holding cached negative information and, if
   they match, the cached negative information is discarded.

   If method 3 is being followed, the same sort of messages are sent as
   with method 2 except they are not flooded but unicast only to the
   specific RBridges the server believes may be holding the cached


L. Dunbar, et al                                               [Page 17]

INTERNET-DRAFT                        TRILL: Directory Assist Mechanisms


   positive or negative information that may need updating.



3.6 Additional Pull Details

   If an RBridge notices that a Pull Directory server is no longer data
   reachable [RFCclear], it MUST discard all responses it is retaining
   from that server within one second as the RBridge can no longer
   receive cache consistency messages from the server.

   Because a Pull Directory server may need to advertise interest in
   Data Labels even though it does not want to received user data in
   those Data Labels, the No Data flag bit is provided as discussed in
   Section 7.3.

4. Directory Use Strategies and Push-Pull Hybrids

   For some edge nodes which have great number of Data Labels enabled,
   managing the MAC&Label <-> RBridgeEdge mapping for hosts under all
   those Data Labels can be a challenge. This is especially true for
   Data Center gateway nodes, which need to communicate with a majority
   of Data Labels if not all.

   For those RBridge Edge nodes, a hybrid model should be considered.
   That is the Push Model is used for some Data Labels, and the Pull
   Model is used for other Data Labels. It is the network operator's
   decision by configuration as to which Data Labels' mapping entries
   are pushed down from directories and which Data Labels' mapping
   entries are pulled.

   For example, assume a data center when hosts in specific Data Labels,
   say VLANs 1 through 100, communicate regularly with external peers,
   the mapping entries for those 100 VLANs should be pushed down to the
   data center gateway routers. For hosts in other Data Labels which
   only communicate with external peers occasionally for management
   interface, the mapping entries for those VLANs should be pulled down
   from directory when the need comes up.

   The mechanisms described above for Push and Pull Directory services
   make it easy to use Push for some Data Labels and Pull for others. In
   fact, different RBridges can even be configured so that some use Push
   Directory services and some use Pull Directory services for the same
   Data Label if both Push and Pull Directory services are available for
   that Data Label. And there can be Data Labels for which directory
   services are not used at all.



4.1 Strategy Configuration

   Each RBridge that has the ability to use directory assistance has,
   for each Data Label X in which it is might ingress native frames, one
   of four major modes:

      0. No directory use. The RBridge does not subscribe to Push
         Directory data or make Pull Directory requests for Data Label X
         and directory data is not consulted on ingressed frames in Data
         Label X that might have used directory data. This includes ARP,
         ND, RARP, and unknown MAC destination addresses, which are
         flooded.

      1. Use Push only. The RBridge subscribes to Push Directory data
         for Data Label X.

      2. Use Pull only. When the RBridge ingresses a frame in Data Label


L. Dunbar, et al                                               [Page 19]

INTERNET-DRAFT                        TRILL: Directory Assist Mechanisms


         X that can use Directory information, if it has cached
         information for the address it uses it. If it does not have
         either cached positive or negative information for the address,
         it sends a Pull Directory query.

      3. Use Push and Pull. The RBridge subscribes to Push Directory
         data for Data Label X. When it ingresses a frame in Data Label
         X that can use Directory information and it does not find that
         information in its link state database of Push Directory
         information, it makes a Pull Directory query.

   The above major Directory use mode is per Data Label. In addition,
   there is a per Data Label per priority minor mode as listed below
   that indicates what should be done if Directory Data is not available
   for the ingressed frame. In all cases, if you are holding Push
   Directory or Pull Directory information to handle the frame given the
   major mode, the directory information is simply used and, in that
   instance, the minor modes does not matter.

      A. Flood immediate. Flood the frame immediately (even if you are
         also sending a Pull Directory) request.

      B. Flood. Flood the frame immediately unless you are going to do a
         Pull Directory request, in which case you wait for the response
         or for the request to time out after retries and flood the
         frame if the request times out.

      C. Discard if complete or Flood immediate. If you have complete
         Push Directory information and the address is not in that
         information, discard the frame. If you do not have complete
         Push Directory information, the same as A above.

      D. Discard if complete or Flood. If you have complete Push
         Directory information and the address is not in that
         information, discard the frame. If you do not have complete
         Push Directory information, the same as B above.

   In addition, the query message priority for Pull Directory requests
   sent can be configured on a per Data Label, per ingressed frame
   priority basis.  The default mappings are as follows where Ingress
   Priority is the priority of the native frame that provoked the Pull
   Directory query:

5. Security Considerations

   Push Directory data is distributed through ESADI-LSPs [ESADI] which
   can be authenticated with the same mechanisms as IS-IS LSPs. See
   [RFC5304] [RFC5310] and the Security Considerations section of
   [ESADI].

   Pull Directory queries and responses are transmitted as RBridge-to-
   RBridge or native RBridge Channel messages. Such messages can be
   secured as specified in TBD.

   For general TRILL security considerations, see [RFC6325].

6. IANA Considerations

   This section give IANA allocation and registry considerations.



6.1 ESADI-Parameter Data

   IANA is request to allocate two ESADI-Parameter TRILL APPsub-TLV flag
   bits for "Push Directory" and "Complete Push" and to create a sub-
   registry in the TRILL Parameters Registry as follows:

      Sub-Registry: ESADI-Parameter APPsub-TLV Bits

      Registration Procedures: IETF Review

      References: [ESADI], This document

         Bit  Mnemonic  Description                      Reference
         ---  --------  -----------                      ---------
          0      UN     Supports Unicast ESADI           [ESADI]
          1      PD     Push Directory Server            This document
          2      CP     Complete Push                    This document
         3-7     -      available for allocation

   In addition, the ESADI-Parameter APPsub-TLV is optionally extended,
   as provided in its original specification in [ESADI], by one byte as
   show below:

                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                | Type          |           (1 byte)
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                | Length        |           (1 byte)
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                |R| Priority    |           (1 byte)
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                | CSNP Time     |           (1 byte)
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                | Flags         |           (1 byte)
                +---------------+
                |PushDirPriority|           (optional, 1 byte)
                +---------------+
                | Reserved for expansion    (variable)
                +-+-+-+-...

   The meanings of all the fields are as specified in [ESADI] except
   that the added PushDirPriority is the priority of the advertising
   ESADI instance to be a Push Directory as described in Section 2.3. If
   the PushDirPriority field is not present (Length = 3) it is treated
   as if it were 0x40. 0x40 is also the value used and place here by an

   RBridge for which this field has not been configured.



6.2 RBridge Channel Protocol Number

   IANA is requested to allocate a new RBridge Channel protocol number
   for "Pull Directory Services" from the range allocable by Standards
   Action and update the table of such protocol number in the TRILL
   Parameters Registry referencing this document.



6.3 Pull Directory and No Data Bits

   IANA is requested to allocate two currently reserved bits in the
   Interested VLANs field of the Interested VLANs sub-TLV (suggested
   bits 3 and 4) and the Interested Labels field of the Interested
   Labels sub-TLV (suggested bits 5 and 6) [RFC6326bis] to indicate Pull
   Directory server (PD) and No Data (ND) respectively. These bits are
   to be added to the subregistry set up in [ESADI].

   In the TRILL base protocol [RFC6325] as extended for FGL [rfcFGL],
   the mere presence of an Interested VLANs or Interested Labels sub-
   TLVs in the LSP of an RBridge indicates connection to end stations in
   the VLANs or FGLs listed and thus a desire to receive multi-
   destination traffic in those Data Labels. But, with Push and Pull
   Directories, advertising that you are a directory server requires
   using these sub-TLVs as part for the Data Label you are serving. If
   such a directory server does not wish to received multi-destination
   user data for the Data Labels it lists in one of these sub-TLVs, it
   sets the "No Data" (ND) bit to one. This means that data on a
   distribution tree may be pruned so as not to reach the "No Data"
   RBridge as long as there are no RBridges interested in the Data who
   are beyond the "No Data" RBridge.  This bit is backwards compatible
   as RBridges ignorant of it will simply no prune when it could, which
   is safe but may cause increased link utilization.
