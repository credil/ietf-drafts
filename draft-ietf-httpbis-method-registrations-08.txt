    Initial Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Method Registrations
               draft-ietf-httpbis-method-registrations-08

Abstract

   This document registers those Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   methods which have been defined in standards-track RFCs before the
   IANA HTTP Method Registry was established.

Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)

Internet-Draft          HTTP Method Registrations              July 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document registers those Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   methods which have been defined in standards-track RFCs other than
   [draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics] before the IANA HTTP Method
   Registry was established.

2.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations related to the registration
   itself.

3.  IANA Considerations

   Appendix A provides initial registrations of HTTP method names for
   the IANA HTTP Method registry at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods> (see Section 2.2 of
   [draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics]).
