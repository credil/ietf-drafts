Internet-Draft     Enum Service ACCT URI Registration       January 2013


1.  Introduction

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, [RFC6116]) is a system that uses DNS
   (Domain Name Service, [RFC1034]) to translate telephone numbers, such
   as '+44 1632 960123', into URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
   [RFC3986]), such as 'acct:user@example.com'.  ENUM exists primarily
   to facilitate the interconnection of systems that rely on telephone
   numbers with those that use URIs to identify resources.

   [I-D.ietf-appsawg-webfinger] is proposing a generic mechanism to
   discover information about resources, including those identified
   through an account based on the 'acct:' URI scheme.
   [I-D.ietf-appsawg-acct-uri] defines the 'acct' URI scheme as a way to
   identify a user's account at a service provider.

   This document registers an enumservice for advertising acct URI
   information associated with an E.164 number.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Use cases

3.1.  Routing of mobile social communications

   The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Social Network Web (SNeW) Enabler
   Release [OMA-SNeW-ER] has introduced a number of Social Networking
   functionalities to mobile subscribers identified by their MSISDN,
   amongst which the ability of following each other's social activities
   across service providers.  Such functionality requires the global
   resolution of the MSISDN to the corresponding account and provider,
   in an analogous way as MMS routing, to identify the target endpoint
   for the related messages.  Although alternatives solutions exist
   (e.g. based on mobile network operations and/or proprietary lookup
   techniques), ENUM provides a globally accessible mechanism for
   enabling resolution from network entities on behalf of an endpoint,
   or from an endpoint itself.

   For example, a user of a service provider could request to follow the
   social activities of user '+44 1632 960123', triggering a network
   entity to perform an ENUM query, eventually followed by a Webfinger
   query, to route this request to the appropriate target provider and
   endpoint.

   A similar mechanism can apply to other types of social networking-
   related messages or other communications targeted to a mobile
   subscriber.

3.2.  Reverse phone lookup

   Yet in another example, an address book endpoint could issue an ENUM
   query looking for a user's account to discover additional personal
   information about that user given his phone number, such as avatar
   and full name.

   Similarly, an endpoint could trigger this resolution process during
   inbound and/or outbound calls to discover additional personal
   information about the remote party.

   The provision of an ENUM record to map a phone number into an account
   may be useful for businesses or professional workers to identify
   themselves publicly (in a similar way as vCard enum records), or be
   used in conjunction with privacy policies to provide a more
   controlled view on some personal details.


4.  IANA Registration

   As defined in [RFC6117], the following is a template covering
   information needed for the registration of the enumservice specified
   in this document:

5.  Examples

   The following is an example of the use of the enumservice registered
   by this document in a NAPTR resource record for phone number +44 1632
   960123.

   $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa.

   IN NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+acct" "!^.*$!acct:441632960123@foo.com!" .

   IN NAPTR 10 101 "u" "E2U+acct" "!^.*$!acct:john.doe@example.com!" .

   Note that in the first record, the revealed information is limited to

   the domain of the service provider serving that user a the userpart
   of the acct URI simply replicates the phone number.


6.  DNS Considerations

   If no "E2U+acct" NAPTR record exist for the requested number, the
   resolution process over issuing ENUM queries may be recursively
   performed over E.164 numbers identified by other NAPTR records for
   the requested number pointing to "tel" URIs [RFC3966].  Whilst this
   process is useful to support, amongst others, number portability as
   per [RFC4769], Section 4, this may also create potential loops in
   this resolution process.  As such ENUM clients performing such ENUM
   queries over "tel" URIs to identify "acct" URIs SHOULD understand the
   "enumdi" indicator defined in [RFC4759].  In particular, if the
   result of the query does not include "E2U+acct" NAPTR records, and
   includes a NAPTR resource record containing a "tel" URI that has the
   same E.164 number, or a "tel" URI with the "enumdi" parameter set,
   that client SHOULD NOT perform subsequent ENUM queries over such
   numbers and SHOULD consider that the original requested number cannot
   be mapped.

   Furthermore the client MAY stop performing subsequent ENUM queries
   after the fifth recursive query as suggested in [RFC6116] section
   5.2.1.


7.  Security Considerations

   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database.  Should
   implementers of this specification use e164.arpa or any other
   publicly available domain as the tree for maintaining PSTN
   enumservice data, this information would be visible to anyone
   anonymously.

   As noted earlier, carriers, service providers, and other users may
   choose not to publish such information in the public e164.arpa tree.
   They may instead simply publish this in an internal ENUM
   infrastructure that is only able to be queried by trusted elements of
   their network, thus limiting threats.

   Per se, this enumservice does not introduce specific security
   considerations beyond [RFC6116], section 7.  However, it has to be
   acknowledged that the proposed enumservice could lead to the
   discovery or disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
   when used in combination with the WebFinger protocol.  Please see
   [I-D.ietf-appsawg-webfinger] , section 10 for additional information
   regarding WebFinger security.

   Linking telephone numbers to Personally Identifiable Information
   (PII) is a very sensitive topic, because it provides a "reverse
   lookup" from the phone number to its owner.  Publication of such PII
   is covered by data-protection law in many legislations.  In most
   cases, the explicit consent of the affected individual is required.

   Users MUST therefore carefully consider the information provided in
   the resource identified by the ENUM record as well as in the record
   itself.  Considerations SHOULD include serving information only to
   entities of the user's choice and/or limiting the comprehension of
   the information provided based on the identity of the requestor.

   It is important to remind that the ENUM record itself does not need
   to contain any personal information but only contains a pointer to an
   account identifier.  This identifier may be queried through the
   Webfinger protocol to discover pointers to personal information (e.g.
   social network information) and an authorisation mechanism may be in
   place in that context with any level of granularity although it is
   out of scope of this document.

   Technically, ENUM records themselves could contain pointers to the
   same endpoints discoverable through Webfinger.  However the
   visibility of ENUM records cannot be controlled based on the
   requesting entity.  In that context the simple mapping of the phone
   number to the account identifier, notwithstanding the disclosure of
   the association itself, still enables the reuse of more advanced
   access policies.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the IANA registration of the enumservice with
   Type "acct" according to the definitions in this document, [RFC6116]
   and [RFC6117].

   Details of the registration are given in Section 4.
