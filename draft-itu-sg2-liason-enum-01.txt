Working Party 1/2, of the International Telecommunication Union
Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) held a meeting of
its collaborators in Berlin Germany 19-26 October 2000.  The agenda
of the meeting contained several contributions regarding RFC 2916:
"E.164 Number and DNS" from the Internet Engineering Task Force's
(IETF) ENUM Working Group - more specifically, the method for
administering and maintaining the E.164-based resources in the
Domain Name System (DNS) as related to the ENUM protocol.
Consequently, in addition to the WP1/2 collaborators, there were
several members of the IETF present to assist with the discussion of
issues contained in the aforementioned contributions.
 
This liaison from WP1/2 to the IETF/ISOC conveys the understandings
of the WP1/2 collaborators resulting from the discussions.
