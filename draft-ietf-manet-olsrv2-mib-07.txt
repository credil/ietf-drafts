Abstract

   This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module
   for configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing
   protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).  The OLSRv2-MIB module is structured
   into state information, performance information, and notifications.
   This additional state and performance information is useful to
   troubleshoot problems and performance issues of the routing protocol.
   Different levels of compliance allow implementers to use smaller
   subsets of all defined objects, allowing for this MIB module to be
   deployed on more constrained routers.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module
   for configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing
   protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).  The OLSRv2-MIB module is structured
   into state information, performance information, and notifications.
   In addition to configuration, this additional state and performance
   information is useful to troubleshoot problems and performance issues
   of the routing protocol.  Different levels of compliance allow
   implementers to use smaller subsets of all defined objects, allowing
   for this MIB module to be deployed on more constrained routers.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB module are defined using the mechanisms defined in
   the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This document
   specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is
   described in [RFC2578], [RFC2579], and [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) [OLSRv2]
   is a table driven, proactive routing protocol, i.e., it exchanges
   topology information with other routers in the network periodically.
   OLSRv2 is an optimization of the classical link state routing
   protocol.  Its key concept is that of MultiPoint Relays (MPRs).  Each
   router selects a set of its neighbor routers (which "cover" all of
   its symmetrically connected 2-hop neighbor routers) as MPRs.  MPRs
   are then used to achieve both flooding reduction and topology
   reduction.

   This document provides management and control capabilities of an
   OLSRv2 instance, allowing to monitor the state and performance of an
   OLSRV2 router, as well as to change settings of the OLSRv2 instance



Herberg, et al.         Expires October 31, 2013                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2013


   (e.g., router or interface parameters such as message intervals
   etc.).

   As OLSRv2 relies on the neighborhood information discovered by the
   "Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol
   (NHDP)" [RFC6130], the OLSRv2-MIB module is aligned with the NHDP-MIB
   [RFC6779] module and augments several of the tables and objects in
   the NHDP-MIB.  In particular, common indexes for router interfaces
   and discovered neighbors are used, as described in Section 5.2.

4.1.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB module.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the OLSRv2 protocol process in the
      router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      OLSRv2 routing process on the router.

   o  Notification Objects - define triggers and associated notification
      messages allowing for asynchronous tracking of pre-defined events
      on the managed router.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the OLSRv2-MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following structure:

   o  olsrv2Objects - defines objects forming the basis for the OLSRv2-
      MIB module.  These objects are divided up by function into the
      following groups:

      *  Configuration Group - defining objects related to the
         configuration of the OLSRv2 instance on the router.

      *  State Group - defining objects which reflect the current state
         of the OLSRv2 instance running on the router.

      *  Performance Group -defining objects which are useful to a
         management station when characterizing the performance of
         OLSRv2 on the router and in the MANET.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2013


   o  olsrv2Notifications - objects defining OLSRv2-MIB module
      notifications.

   o  olsrv2Conformance - defining the minimal and maximal conformance
      requirements for implementations of this MIB module.

5.1.  The Configuration Group

   The OLSRv2 router is configured with a set of controls.  The
   authoritative list of configuration controls within the OLSRv2-MIB
   module are found within the MIB module itself.  Generally, an attempt
   was made in developing the OLSRv2-MIB module to support all
   configuration objects defined in [OLSRv2].  For all of the
   configuration parameters, the same constraints and default values of
   these parameters as defined in [OLSRv2] are followed.

5.2.  The State Group

   The State Group reports current state information of a router running
   [OLSRv2].  The OLSRv2-MIB module State Group tables were designed to
   contain the complete set of state information defined within the
   information bases in [OLSRv2].

   The OLSRv2-MIB module State Group tables are constructed as
   extensions to the corresponding tables within the State Group of the
   NHDP-MIB [RFC6779] module.  Use of the AUGMENTS clause is made, when
   possible, to accomplish these table extensions.  Further, the State
   Group tables defined in this MIB module are aligned with the
   according tables in the NHDP-MIB [RFC6779] module, as described in
   Section 6.2.

5.3.  The Performance Group

   The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance.
   Frequent changes of sets or frequent recalculation of the routing set
   or the MPRs can have a negative influence on the performance of
   OLSRv2.  This MIB module defines several objects that can be polled
   in order to, e.g., calculate histories or monitor frequencies of
   changes.  This may help the network administrator to determine
   unusual topology changes or other changes that affect stability and
   reliability of the MANET.  One such framework is specified in REPORT-
   MIB [REPORT-MIB].

5.4.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications sub-tree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the OLSRv2-MIB module and their intended purpose or
   utility.



Herberg, et al.         Expires October 31, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2013


   The same mechanisms for improving the network performance by reducing
   the number of notifications apply as defined in Section 5.1 of
   [RFC6779].  The following objects are used to define the thresholds
   and time windows for specific notifications defined in the NHDP-MIB
   module: olsrv2RoutingSetRecalculationCountThreshold,
   olsrv2RoutingSetRecalculationCountWindow,
   olsrv2MPRSetRecalculationCountThreshold, and
   olsrv2MPRSetRecalculationCountWindow.

   The Notifications Group contains Control, Objects and States, where
   the Control contains definitions of objects to control the frequency
   of notifications being sent.  The Objects define the supported
   notifications and the State is used to define additional information
   to be carried within the notifications.

5.5.  Tables and Indexing

   The OLSRv2-MIB module's tables are indexed via the following
   constructs:

   o  nhdpIfIndex - the ifIndex of the local router on which NHDP is
      configured.  This is defined in the NHDP-MIB.

   o  nhdpDiscIfIndex - a locally managed index representing a known
      interface on a neighboring router.  This is defined in the NHDP-
      MIB.

   o  nhdpDiscRouterIndex - a locally managed index representing an ID
      of a known neighboring router.  This is defined in the NHDP-MIB.

   o  olsrv2LibOrigSetIpAddrType and olsrv2LibOrigSetIpAddr - a recently
      used originator address by this router, and its type and prefix
      length.

   o  olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddrType, olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddr and
      olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddrPrefixLen - the network address of an
      attached network which can be reached via this router, and its
      type and its prefix length.

   o  olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetRouterId - this is an additional index
      for each Remote Router's IfAddr associated with the
      olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetIpAddr.

   o  olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddrType and
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr - this is the originator
      address of a router which can reach the router with originator
      address TR_to_orig_addr in one hop.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2013


   o  olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddr and
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddrPrefixLen - this is is the network
      address of an attached network, which may be reached via the
      router with originator address AN_orig_addr.

   o  olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddrType, olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddr
      and olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddrPrefixLen - this is the address
      of the destination, either the address of an interface of a
      destination router, or the network address of an attached network.

   These tables and their indexing are:

   o  olsrv2InterfaceTable - describes the OLSRv2 status on the NHDP
      interfaces of this router.  This table has AUGMENTS {
      nhdpInterfaceEntry } and as such it is indexed via the nhdpIfIndex
      from the NHDP-MIB.

   o  olsrv2IibLinkSetTable - records all links from other routers which
      are, or recently were, 1-hop neighbors.  This table has AUGMENTS {
      nhdpIibLinkSetEntry } and as such it is indexed via the set
      nhdpIfIndex and nhdpDiscIfIndex.

   o  olsrv2Iib2HopSetTable - records network addresses of symmetric
      2-hop neighbors and the links to the associated 1-hop neighbors.
      This table has AUGMENTS { nhdpIib2HopSetEntry } and as such it is
      indexed via the set nhdpIfIndex, nhdpDiscIfIndex,
      nhdpIib2HopSetIpAddressType and nhdpIib2HopSetIpAddress.

   o  olsrv2LibOrigSetTable - records addresses that were recently used
      as originator addresses by this router.  This table has INDEX {
      olsrv2LibOrigSetIndex }.

   o  olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetTable - records its local non-OLSRv2
      interfaces via which it can act as gateways to other networks.
      This table has INDEX { olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIndex }.

   o  olsrv2NibNeighborSetTable - records all network addresses of each
      1-hop neighbor.  This table has AUGMENTS { nhdpNibNeighborSetEntry
      } and as such it is indexed via the nhdpDiscRouterIndex.

   o  olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetTable - records information describing
      each remote router in the network that transmits TC messages.
      This table has INDEX { olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetRouterId }.

   o  olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetTable - records topology information
      about the network.  This table has INDEX {
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetIndex }.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2013


   o  olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetTable - records topology
      information about the routable addresses within the MANET, and via
      which routers they may be reached.  This table has INDEX
      {olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetIndex }.

   o  olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetTable - records information about networks
      (which may be outside the MANET) attached to other routers and
      their routable addresses.  This table has INDEX {
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetIndex }.

   o  olsrv2TibRoutingSetTable - records the first hop along a selected
      path to each destination for which any such path is known.  This
      table has INDEX { olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddrPrefLen}.

   o  olsrv2InterfacePerfTable - records performance counters for each
      active OLSRv2 interface on this device. selected path to each
      destination for which any such path is known.  This table has
      AUGMENTS { nhdpInterfacePerfEntry } and as such it is indexed via
      nhdpIfIndex from the NHDP-MIB.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   This section specifies the relationship of the MIB modules contained
   in this document to other standards, particularly to standards
   containing other MIB modules.  MIB modules and specific definitions
   imported from MIB modules that SHOULD be implemented in conjunction
   with the MIB module contained within this document are identified in
   this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The System group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] module is defined as
   being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity
   as a whole.  The System group provides identification of the
   management entity and certain other system-wide data.  The OLSRv2-MIB
   module does not duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the NHDP-MIB

   OLSRv2 depends on the neighborhood information that is discovered by
   [RFC6130].  In order access the Objects relating to discovered
   neighbors, the State Group tables of the NHDP-MIB [RFC6779] module
   are aligned with this MIB module.  This is accomplished through the
   use of the AUGMENTS capability of SMIv2 and the definition of
   TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS in the NHDP-MIB module: specifically the
   NeighborRouterIndex.  These object types are used to develop indexes



Herberg, et al.         Expires October 31, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2013


   into common NHDP-MIB module and routing protocol State Group tables.
   These objects are locally significant but should be locally common to
   the NHDP-MIB module and the OLSRv2-MIB module implemented on a common
   networked router.  This will allow for improved cross referencing of
   information across the two MIB modules.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following OLSRv2-MIB module IMPORTS objects from NHDP-MIB
   [RFC6779], SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF
   [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863], INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001] and FLOAT-TC-
   MIB [RFC6340].

           As such, this table AUGMENTS the nhdpInterfaceTable
           defined in the NHDP-MIB (RFC 6779). NHDP interfaces
           are explicitly defined by network manager servers
           for interfaces on the device that are intended to
           run MANET protocols.  The olsrv2InterfaceTable
           contains a single boolean object, the
           olsrv2InterfaceAdminStatus object.

           A conceptual row in this table exists if and only
           if either a manager has explicitly created the row
           in the nhdpInterfaceTable
           or there is an interface on the managed device
           that supports and runs NHDP.

           If the corresponding entry with nhdpIfIndex value
           is deleted from the nhdpInterfaceTable, then the entry
           in this table is automatically deleted and
           OLSRv2 is disabled on this interface,
           and all configuration and state information
           related to this interface is to be removed
           from memory.

           The olsrv2InterfaceAdminStatus can only be
           'enabled' if the corresponding olsrv2AdminStatus
           object is also set to 'enabled'."

8.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module defines objects for the configuration, monitoring and
   notification of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol version 2
   [OLSRv2].  OLSRv2 allows routers to acquire topological information
   of the routing domain by virtue of exchanging TC message, to
   calculate shortest paths to each destination router in the routing
   domain, to select relays for network-wide transmissions etc.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on



Herberg, et al.         Expires October 31, 2013               [Page 69]

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2013


   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  olsrv2TcInterval, olsrv2TcMinInterval - these writable objects
      control the rate at which TC messages are sent.  If set at too
      high a rate, this could represent a form of DOS attack by
      overloading interface resources.  If set low, OLSRv2 may not
      converge fast enough to provide accurate routes to all
      destinations in the routing domain.

   o  olsrv2TcHopLimit - defines the hop limit for TC messages.  If set
      too low, messages will not be forwarded beyond the defined scope,
      and thus routers further away from the message originator will not
      be able to construct appropriate topology graphs.

   o  olsrv2OHoldTime, olsrv2THoldTime, olsrv2AHoldTime,
      olsrv2RxHoldTime, olsrv2PHoldTime, olsrv2FHoldTime - define hold
      times for tuples of different Information Bases of OLSRv2.  If set
      too low, information will expire quickly, and may this harm a
      correct operation of the routing protocol.

   o  olsrv2WillFlooding and olsrv2WillRouting - define the willingness
      of this router to become MPR.  If this is set to WILL_NEVER (0),
      the managed router will not forward any TC messages, nor accept a
      selection to become MPR by neighboring routers.  If set to
      WILL_ALWAYS (15), the router will be preferred by neighbors during
      MPR selection, and may thus attract more traffic.

   o  olsrv2TpMaxJitter, olsrv2TtMaxJitter, olsrv2FMaxJitter - define
      jitter values for TC message transmission and forwarding.  If set
      too low, control traffic may get lost if the channel is lossy.

   o  olsrv2LinkMetricType - defines the type of the link metric that a
      router uses (e.g., ETX or hop-count).  Whenever this value
      changes, all link metric information recorded by the router is
      invalid, causing a reset of information acquired from other
      routers in the MANET.  Moreover, if olsrv2LinkMetricType on a
      router is set to a value that is not known to other routers in the
      MANET, these routers will not be able to establish routes to that
      router or transiting that router.  Existing routes to the router
      with a olsrv2LinkMetricType unknown to other routers in the MANET
      will be removed.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over

   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetTable - The contains information on the
      topology of the MANET, specifically the IP address of the routers
      in the MANET (as identified by
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr and
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetToOrigIpAddr objects).  This information
      provides an adversary broad information on the members of the
      MANET, located within this single table.  This information can be
      use to expedite attacks on the other members of the MANET without
      having to go through a laborious discovery process on their own.
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr is the index into the
      table, and has a MAX-ACCESS of 'not-accessible'.  However, this
      information can be exposed using SNMP operations.

   MANET technology is often deployed to support communications of
   emergency services or military tactical applications.  In these
   applications, it is imperative to maintain the proper operation of
   the communications network and to protect sensitive information
   related to its operation.  Therefore, when implementing these
   capabilities, the full use of SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms for
   authentication and privacy is RECOMMENDED.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], Section 8, including
   full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  Applicability Statement

   This document describes objects for configuring parameters of the
   Optimized Link State Routing version 2 (OLSRv2) Protocol [OLSRv2]
   process on a router.  This MIB module, denoted OLSRv2-MIB, also



Herberg, et al.         Expires October 31, 2013               [Page 71]

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2013


   reports state, performance information and notifications.  The OLSRv2
   protocol relies upon information gathered via the Neighborhood
   Discovery Protocol [RFC6130] in order to perform its operations.  The
   NHDP protocol is managed via the NHDP-MIB [RFC6779].

   MANET deployments can greatly differ in aspects of dynamicity of the
   topology, capacity and loss rates of underlying channels, traffic
   flow directions, memory and CPU capacity of routers etc.  SNMP and
   therefore this MIB module are only applicable for a subset of MANET
   deployments, in particular deployments:

   o  In which routers have enough memory and CPU resources to run SNMP
      and expose the MIB module.

   o  Where a network management station (NMS) is defined to which
      notifications are sent, and from which routers can be managed.

   o  Where this NMS is reachable from routers in the MANET most of the
      time (as notifications to the NMS and management information from
      the NMS to the router will be lost when connectivity is
      temporarily lost).  This requires that the topology of the MANET
      is only moderately dynamic.

   o  Where the underlying wireless channel supports enough bandwidth to
      run SNMP, and where loss rates of the channel are not exhaustive.

   Certain MANET deployments, such as community networks with non-mobile
   routers, dynamic topology because of changing link quality, and a
   pre-defined gateway (that could also serve as NMS), are examples of
   networks applicable for this MIB module.  Other, more constrained
   deployments of MANETs may not be able to run SNMP and require
   different management protocols.

   Some level of configuration, i.e., read-write objects, are desirable
   for OLSRv2 deployments.  Topology related configuration such as the
   ability to enable OLSRv2 on new interfaces or initially configure
   OLSRv2 on a router's interfaces through the
   olsrv2InterfaceAdminStatus object is critical to initial system
   startup.  The OLSRv2 protocol allows for some level of performance
   tuning through various protocol parameters and this MIB allows for
   configuration of those protocol parameters through read-write objects
   such as the olsrv2TcHopLimit or the olsrv2FMaxJitter.  Other read-
   write objects allow for the control of Notification behavior through
   this MIB module, e.g., the
   olsrv2RoutingSetRecalculationCountThreshold object.  A fuller
   discussion of MANET network management applicability is to be
   provided elsewhere [USE-CASES].
