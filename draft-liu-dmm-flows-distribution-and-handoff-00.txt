Abstract

   This document has a normative description of the service flows based
   on IPv6. It makes the upgrade of management model from the entire
   node granularity to the single service flow granularity, with the
   compatibility to the existing mobile IPv6. It shows a distributed,
   compatible with mobile IPv6 network layer mobility solution, which
   would take different mobility management strategies according to the
   Correspondent Node's position, network conditions and service
   requirements of the different service flows so as to achieve the
   service flow granularity switching and transmission path control. And
   the standard will also provide route optimization mechanism between
   the Mobile Node and the ordinary Correspondent Node that doesn't
   support mobile IPv6, playing a role in promoting the development of
   new applications and business based on mobile IPv6.

1. Introduction

   This standard compatible with the standard mobile IPv6 protocol
   allows a plurality of Distributed Home-Proxy (DHP) and Distributed
   Home Address (DHoA) for a Mobile Node (MN) while there are Home Agent
   (HA) and Home-Of-Address (HoA) already. MN chooses whether to start
   the mobility management protocol, according to the type and initiator
   of the service, and further makes a selection from the standard
   mobile IPv6 and the DMIPv6 proposed here. The deployment of the
   DMIPv6 implements step by step, with the compatibility to the
   existing mobile IPv6.

   With the difference to existing mobile IPv6 in management model the
   DMIPv6 could select different DHP for a MN's different service flows.
   MN takes different management strategy for different service flows
   according to network conditions and the actual requirements during
   the move. The introduction of DHP not only reduces the home network
   congestion and HA load, but also greatly reduces the possible
   failures in home network and HA, and the bad impacts to the MN.
   What's more, the MN could achieve optimized transmission path and
   transmission delay even choosing bidirectional tunnel, because the
   DHP is close to the Correspondent Node (CN). At the same time, the
   introduction of DHP allows the CN, which is a server, to enhance its
   mobile client support by deploying DHP in the network area without
   any updates itself.

   The following subsections will specify the requirements of service
   flow distribution and switching management technology based on mobile
   IPv6.

   In addition, this document uses the following terms:

   Distributed Home-Proxy (DHP)  is a router near CN, with the function
   for an extension of the HA, which assigns distributed home address
   for the MN, receives and forwards the packet between the MN and CN.
   It plays a role in router optimization and switching management on
   service flow granularity.

   Distributed Mobile IPv6 (DMIPv6)  is a distributed network layer
   mobility solution compatible with mobile IPv6, which would take
   different mobility management strategies according to the CN's
   position, network conditions and service requirements of the
   different service flows so as to achieve the service flow granularity
   switching and transmission path control. And the standard will also
   provide route optimization mechanism between the MN and the ordinary
   CN that doesn't support mobile IPv6.

   Distributed Home Address (DHoA)  is a home address that MN gets from
   the corresponding DHP for establishing a connection with CN so as to
   achieve the service flow granularity switching and transmission path
   control.

3. Basic Framework

   Distributed Mobile IPv6(DMIPv6), a distributed mobility management
   architecture and be compatible with Mobile IP, introduce Distributed
   Home-Proxy(DHP) to the existing Mobile IPv6 architecture. In DMIPv6,
   DHP is deployed in subdomain of each network, and also is deployed
   with CN.

   DHP is implemented based on HA, and multiple DHPs independent of each
   other can be deployed in the same domain. the DHP is deployed the
   same style as the HA and general router. Under such condition, MN can
   select one or more DHPs according to the state of DHP and service
   demand. In general, one DHP is enough, but also multiple DHP would be
   selected to backup or improve concurrent performance. Figure 1 show
   the basic architecture of DMIPv6:

   Figure 1 Architecture of Service Flow Distribution and Handoff

            Management

   As Figure 1, there exists multiple independent DHPs in the CN-hosted
   network, MN can selected one of them as the proxy server, the
   introduction of DHP greatly decreases the MN's dependence on HA, and
   can also optimize the transport path and transport delay.

   When MN moves to a new link, DHP can act as proxy and forward data.
   According to the deployment style and the degree of the available
   equipment's support to DMIPv6, MN can perform the service flow
   management policy of this standard, and also can be compatiable with
   traditional MIPv6 which utilize the HA of home network.

4. Message Types

   In this standard, majority of equipments need to complete a series of
   interactions to transmit information. The following messages are
   extented from the standard ICMPv6 messages. All extension types of
   the extended ICMP messages are different from those of standards
   defined by international organizations like IETF. If collisions occur

Internet-Draft        flows-distribution-and-handoff          March 2013


   in the future, values of corresponding message types should be
   adjusted according to the actual situation.

4.1. Messages Between MN and HA

   Messages between MN and HA include binding update message (BU) sent
   when MN moves and binding acknowledgment messages (BA). This standard
   is compatible with standard mobile IPv6 protocol. For detailed
   information about the above messages, reference the IETF RFC 6275.

4.2. Messages Between MN and CN

   Messages between MN and CN include binding update message (BU) sent
   when MN updates its CoA-address and binding acknowledgment messages
   (BA). This standard is compatible with standard mobile IPv6 protocol.
   For detailed information about the above messages, reference the IETF
   RFC 6275.

4.3. DHP Query Message

   DHP query message is used by MN to perform the DHP query and
   selection operations. This standard proposes 4 kinds of DHP query
   method. Corresponding query methods are depicted as follow:

4.3.1. Dynamic DHP Discovery Query/Acknowledgement Message

   In this method, DHP query messages are sent to corresponding network
   to request response directly. This procedure is similar to "dynamic
   home agent address discovery mechanism" in MIPv6. When adopt this
   method, all DHPs in a common CN domain should maintain the status
   information of other DHPs, i.e. every DHP maintains a list of
   information about all DHPs in current domain.

   When comes to specific operation, MN query the DNS to get the DHP
   anycast address in the CN domain, and then send dynamic DHP discovery
   query message to that anycast address. According to the routing
   protocols, the topologically nearest DHP from the mobile node may
   receive the request message and then respond to it. Status
   information of all DHPs in the CN domain should be included in the
   reply message. MN can perform the HP selection based on this state
   information. This approach is the active query mode of MN.

      DHP proxy server address: local IPv6 address of the sender. This
      address should be a DHP network interface address. If there exists
      more than one DHP in current network domain, information of all
      DHPs should be sequentially contained in the options part.

      DHP status information: the current DHP state information should
      include load conditions, process capability, distance from CN and
      so on.

4.3.2. Multicast Request DHP Query/Acknowledgement Message

   Through this method, IP address and status information of DHP in the
   CN domain can be obtained by sending multicast request message. This
   method requires all DHPs from one CN domain form a multicast group,
   then share a multicast address.

   Firstly MN query the DNS to get the DHP multicast address in the CN
   domain, and then send query message to that multicast address. Since
   then, all DHPs in the multicast group will reply acknowledgement
   message to the MN which also contains DHP address and other status
   information. This also is a MN active query method.

      to zero by the sender, and must be ignored by the receiver.

   o Options: Sender must contain following options in the request
      message:

      DHP proxy server address: local IPv6 address of the sender.

      DHP status information: state information of this machine,
      contains load conditions, process capability, distance from CN and
      so on.

      The distance here is as same as defined above. Depending on the
      routing protocols, it may be the number of hops or delay in the
      actual network topology.

4.3.3. Specific Server DHP Query/Response Message

   The DHP option can also use special DHP management server to
   complete.
   In actual circumstances, we can set global DHP server administration.
   The main role is to maintain all the DHP status information in the
   real-time network.

4.3.3.1. DHP Query/Response Message through DNS

   MN can use DNS to query the DHP management server address, and then
   send the corresponding DHP query messages to the server, the server
   sends the request a timely response.

   In accordance with the different handling ways of the MN end, these
   methods can be divided into two ways which are active and passive
   queries:

4.3.3.1.1. Active Query

   In this way, the MN sends a request message to DHP management server,
   the server will send all of the information to the MN terminal, for
   MN itself to make a choice. It is called MN active query.

   1. DHP query message

Internet-Draft        flows-distribution-and-handoff          March 2013


      The DHP query message in this way is the same with the
      corresponding query message in 4.3.1, the difference is that the
      message type code is 164 and the destination address is DHP
      management server address.

   2. DHP Query Response Message

      DHP query response message in this way is the same with the
      corresponding query response message in 4.3.1, the difference is
      that the message type code is 165 and the destination address is
      DHP management server address.

4.3.3.1.2. Passive Query

   Different from the above mentioned active query, in the passive way,
   the MN sends a request message to the DHP information management
   server, the request message further includes business type that MN
   initiate currently and other relevant requirements of DHP ( including
   the ability to handle, the size of the load, the routing hops
   requests and so on. According to the requirements of MN, DHP
   information management server complete DHP preferred choice for MN in
   predetermined rules , then the selected DHP information response to
   MN. The Message format is as below:

      initiated, processing capability, load requirements and the
      routing request and so on, users can also make further needs
      customization expansion according to the actual situation.

   2. DHP Query Response Message

      DHP query response message in this way is the same with the
      corresponding query response message in 4.3.2, the difference is
      that the message type code is 165 and the destination address is
      DHP management server address.

4.3.3.2. DHP Query/Response Message through CN

   This way, CN maintenance the DHP information of its the area , and
   response MN query information. At this point, CN need for further
   upgrades and extensions, such as CN needs to be able to receive
   routing announcements of its domain and record the relevant
   information, normal CN doesn't have this feature.

   The query can also be divided into two ways of active and passive
   queries: MN can choose active query, in this way CN provide all the
   state information of DHP in the domain to the MN for choice; in a
   passive manner, MN can sent the demand CN, CN judge and choose
   according to a predetermined set of rules , finally send chosen DHP
   information back to MN.

   1. DHP Query Message

      The DHP query message in this way is the same with the
      corresponding query message in 4.3.3, the difference is that the
      destination address is the corresponding network interface IPv6
      address for the current CN.

      is the corresponding network interface IPv6 address for the
      current CN.

4.4. DHoA Request/Response Message

   After choosing DHP, MN need apply a specific DHoA from the selected
   DHP , which is completed by sending a message of DHoA application.
   Based on the domain prefix information and address generation
   algorithm, DHP generate the corresponding DHoA address, and then back
   the address information to the MN, message format is shown in Figure
   7 and figure 8.

4.5. DHP Binding Update/Confirmation Message

   In this standard, if the DHP service is enabled, then when MN moves,
   we need to judge whether to continue the current business, then make
   a  DHP binding update for current CoA address . This binding update
   message format is similar with the binding update message of BU in
   MIPv6 which MN sent to HA. extend a byte to store the corresponding
   business flow port number In its message extension header , used to
   distinguish the different traffic flow, The message format is shown
   in Figure 9. Binding update confirm message between DHP and MN is the
   same with BA in MIPv6. The message format can be seen in
   IETF RFC 6275.

      message:

      Business flow attribute, business port number when initiating
      business locally, used to identify a service flow between the host
      and the corresponding DHP.

5. DMIPv6 Workflow

   This standard provides a distributed and IPv6 compatible solution
   named DMIPv6 which enables service flow distribution and handoff
   management. We suggest MN has already moved to foreign network from
   home network here, thus MN should has HoA address and CoA address. We
   introduce the main processing workflow of the technical proposal in
   this standard, with 2 steps: the processing procedure of the new
   service flows and the MN handoffs, which corresponds to the service
   flow distribution and mobility handoff management.

5.1. The Processing Workflow of New Service Connection

   How the processing workflow do in the DMIPv6 when there is a new
   service connection between MN and CN. The detailed procedure is
   introduced as follows, and the related message interaction diagram is
   introduced in Figure 10. The detailed message format is showed in
   Chapter 4.

5.1.1. The Decision of the Mobility Requirement of Service Flow

   MN decides whether the service flow needs mobility support according
   to the service type of the new connection request. The standard of
   this decision can refer to the requirement of the MN itself and set
   the decision rule in advance:

   If MN decides that the service flow needs mobility support, then it
   goes to section 5.1.2; or MN will use the old CoA address to
   establish the connection with CN.

5.1.2. The Requirement Decision Started by the New Connection

   Mobile nodes decides whether the new connection request is started by
   the local MN, if it is then MN goes to section 5.1.3; or MN uses HoA
   address to establish the connection with CN.

5.1.3. DHP Query

   MN queries the DHP address and status of CN's network for its service
   flow, and there are 4 ways to realize the DHP query, which can be


Liu, et al.            Expires September 10, 2013              [Page 17]

Internet-Draft        flows-distribution-and-handoff          March 2013


   found in section 4.3. Figure 10 provides the message interaction
   diagram for different ways of query. Figure 10(a) is for the query of
   dynamic discovery and multicast request in section 4.3.1 and 4.3.2.
   Figure 10(b) is for the query which introduces DHP management server
   or uses CN in section 4.3.3 and 4.3.4.

5.1.4. DHP Selection

   After the DHP query, MN needs to make the DHP selection. For the
   active query introduced in section 4.3, MN will decide which DHP
   serves itself according to different targets. The actual decision can
   be made in MN in advance, such as the distance to CN, processing
   ability, related workload information, etc. As for the passive query,
   MN can directly achieve the DHP address and the corresponding
   information.

   Besides, during the process procedure of this standard, DHP always
   knows MN's location information and must ensure to avoid MN's
   information disclosure. As a result, the DHP selection introduces the
   selection of DHP's security mechanism. Each DHP will make its
   security warranty as one of the most important status information and
   can provide hierarchical classification on occasion. As for the
   active query in section 4.3, MN can decide to select which security
   level of DHP to serve it; as for the passive query, MN needs the
   related management server to make selection policy and directly
   achieve the related information. It is preferred that these security
   requirements are considered as an integral part of the DMM design.

5.1.5. DHoA Address Application

   MN will send the corresponding address application message to the DHP
   after deciding which DHP serves it. DHP can create the required DHoA
   message according to the address creation algorithm and local prefix
   information, and then inform the MN of this DHoA. At the same time,
   it will bind the allocated DHoA with MN's current address.

5.1.6. Establishing the Communication Connection

   MN uses the queried DHoA to establish the connection with CN, and at
   the same time, DHP will save the information of DHoA and MN's
   address. It maintains a mapping table of the DHoA, MN and a service
   connection, and this mapping table is used for the management of
   mobility handoff.

   A notice is that, MN will use HoA to establish the connection with CN
   if the DHP query is failed in DHP, which means no DHP is found to
   serve the current MN. Later workflow is the same as that defined in
   MIPv6.

Internet-Draft        flows-distribution-and-handoff          March 2013


5.1.7. Confirming the Communication Mode

   MN needs to decide whether to use routing optimization mode or bi-
   direction tunneling mode according to the situation how CN supports
   the routing optimization. MN will use routing optimization mode for
   the CN which supports routing optimization; or it will use the bi-
   direction tunneling mode. After confirming the communication mode, MN
   will start data transmission with CN.

5.2. The Processing Workflow when MN Moves

   In the communication between MN and CN, when MN moves, first need to
   judge whether the DHP has been enabled. For the enabled DHP, to carry
   on the following steps, otherwise according to the standard MIPv6
   protocol to execute.

5.2.1. The Qos Conditions Identification of A New Access Network

   MN According to the Qos condition of a new access network, business
   priorities and the Qos requirement to judge whether the Qos
   requirement has been satisfied and whether the business should be
   continue. Specific we can achieve the condition of network interface,
   topology-aware, business flow parameter estimation of available
   bandwidth measurement, network packet loss rate and throughput to
   implement the requirement.



5.2.2. Mobile Switching Management

   For the service streams need to continue communication, will perform
   the following operations:

   1. MN bind the CoA address and the port of the flow with the selected
      DHP.

   2. DHP Replies binding update confirmation.

   3. DHP performs proxy functions, intercepts the packets of CN sent to
      the MN existing home network, through the establishment of the
      tunnel DHP sent the packets to the new access network of MN.

   4. For the CN of supporting the route optimization function, MN binds
      the new CoA address with CN, begin to communicate with CN until
      the CN's reply has been accepted. For the CN of not supporting the
      route optimization function, MN will carry on communication and
      transmission by bidirectional tunnel.

   For the service streams that don't need to continue communication and
   Qos has no requirement. MN will stop the flow and will not bind the
   new CoA address with DHP.

   For different businesses, MN can take different interrupt.
   Specifically, according to different transport layer protocols, and
   its own characteristics MN will take different message exchange or
   notification.

6. Security Considerations

   This standard is compatible with MIPv6, in the meantime, DHP
   equipments are added to it. Its basic procedures and messages
   exchanging schemes are similar to MIPv6, which lead to similar
   security issues like MIPv6's, including the security of dynamic DHP
   discovery, addresses binding and tunnels setting up between MN, HA,
   and CN. Detailed information in IETF RFC 6275.

   This standard is compliant with standard MIPv6, which means MN still
   has HoA in home domain. When MN is initiating a new connection with
   DMIPv6, it will first apply for DHoA. According to MIPv6, MN's HoA is
   permanent during in its travelling, so CN always knows its HoA. So CN
   will see MN travel from home domain to network with same prefix like
   DHoA. In addition, DHP is commonly in CN's domain and is close to CN,
   so CN will identify that MN has already moved to place near itself.
   In the whole process, CoA is hidden from CN, which avoid some
   security risks to some extend.

   In the standard, DMIPv6 will be chosen when MN initates connection
   first. So, if there are random or periodic pseudo-connections, the
   process of DHP lookup and DHoA application will be triggered, which
   will impose heavy burden on MN and DHP. In fact, it's likely that

   from trojans and hackers' attacks. Under such circumstance, MN should
   use secured authentication to limit the number of pseudo-connections,
   and set bidirectional security mechanisms in DHP.

   When DMIPv6 is turned on, DHP will always know MN's location, and can
   send the information to third parties, while those request for
   location may be ill-intended. So, DHP needs to build enough security
   mechanisms to guard MN's information. Whether DHP has security
   mechanisms will be an important condition in MN's inqury to DHP.
   Detailed information see 5.1.4.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document proposes 4 DHP query methods, and 8 message types
   totally for them:

   o The Dynamic DHP Discovery Query Message, and the Dynamic DHP
      Discovery Acknowledgement Message, described in Section 4.3.1

   o The Multicast Request DHP Query Message, and the Multicast Request
      DHP Acknowledgement Message, described in Section 4.3.2

   o The Specific Server DHP Query Message, in Section 4.3.3.1.2

   o The DHoA Request Message, in Section 4.4.1

   o The DHoA Request Response Message, in Section 4.4.2

   o The DHP Binding Update Message, in Section 4.5
