     Abstract 

     There are scenarios that require two or more LSPs or segments of 
     LSPs to follow same route in the network. This document specifies 
     methods to communicate route inclusions along the loose hops during 
     path setup using the Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic 
     Engineering (RSVP-TE) protocol.

     1. Introduction 

        There are scenarios that require two or more Label Switched 
        Paths (LSPs) to follow same route in the network. E.g., many 
        deployments require member LSPs of a bundle/ aggregated link (or 
        Forwarding Adjacency (FA))) follow the same route. Possible 
        reasons for two or more LSPs to follow the same end-to-end or 
        partial route include, but are not limited to:

        . Fate sharing: an application may require that two or more LSP 
          fail together. In the example of bundle link this would mean 
          that if one component goes down, the entire bundle goes down. 

        . Homogeneous Attributes: it is often required that two or more 
          LSPs have the same TE metrics like latency, delay variation, 
          etc. In the example of a bundle/ aggregated link this would 
          meet the requirement that all component links (FAs) of a 
          bundle should have same latency and delay variation. As noted 
          in [OSPF-TE-METRIC] and [ISIS-TE-METRIC], in certain 
          networks, such as financial information networks, network 
          performance (e.g. latency and latency variation) is becoming 
          critical and hence having bundles with component links (FAs) 
          with homogeneous delay and delay variation is important.  

        Similarly, there are scenarios where two or more LSPs need to 
        follow a given resource in the network, e.g., two partially 
        overlapping LSPs are required. In this case, inclusion of 
        certain abstract nodes or resources between a specific pair of 
        abstract nodes present in an ERO is required.   

        The RSVP-TE specification [RFC3209] and GMPLS extensions to 
        RSVP-TE [RFC3473] allow abstract nodes and resources to be 
        explicitly included in a path setup, e.g., using IPv4 prefix ERO 
        subobject [RFC3209], IPv6 prefix ERO subobject [RFC3209] and 
        Unnumbered Interface ID ERO subobject [RFC3477], etc. However, 
        such inclusion may not be possible in the following scenarios:  

        . Inclusion of a LSP path which does not originate, terminate 
          or traverse the source node, in which case the addresses of 
          the path for which inclusion is required are unknown to the 
          source node. 

        . Inclusion of a LSP path which, while known at the source node 
          of the diverse LSP, has incomplete or unavailable route 
          information, e.g. due to confidentiality of the path 
          attributes. In these cases, the ingress node lacks sufficient 
          knowledge about the loose hop. The ingress node, therefore, 
          is not able to divide a loose hop into a proper sequence of 
          strict or a sequence of finer-grained loose hops. Inter-
          domain and GMPLS overlay networks may present such 
          restrictions.  

       The above-mentioned use cases require relevant path inclusion 
       requirements to be communicated to the route expanding nodes. 
       This document addresses these requirements and defines 
       procedures to address them.

     2. RSVP-TE signaling extensions 

        New IPv4 and IPv6 Point-to-Point (P2P) LSP ERO subobject types 
        are defined in this document. These ERO subobjects are used to 
        communicate path inclusion requirements to the ERO expanding 
        node(s). For this purpose, the subobjects carry RSVP-TE 
        Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) of the reference LSP who's 
        Path is be used to expand the loose hop of the LSP being 
        signaled. This document only defines the use of these objects 
        for ERO loose hops.  

     2.1. IPv4 Point-to-Point LSP ERO subobject 

        The IPv4 Point-to-Point LSP ERO subobject is defined as follows:  

         0                   1                   2                   3

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
         

          L 
               The L bit is an attribute of the subobject.  The L bit is 
               set if the subobject represents a loose hop in the ERO. 
               If the bit is not set, the subobject represents a strict 
               hop in the explicit route.  

               This document only defines the use of the subobject in 
               loose hopes in the ERO, i.e., L bit MUST of set to 1.

          Length 

              The length contains the total length of the subobject in 
              bytes, including the type and length fields. The length is 
              always 24. 

          Inclusion Flags  
           
               The Inclusion-Flags are used to communicate desirable 
               types of inclusion. The following flags are defined.  
                 
               0x01 = Mandatory inclusion 
               This flag is used to indicate that the route of the LSP 
               being signaled MUST follow the path specified by the LSP 
               subobject.  
                
               0x02 = Best-effort inclusion 
               This flag is used to indicate that the route of the LSP 
               being signaled SHOULD follow the path specified by the 
               LSP subobject.  
                
          The remaining fields are used to specify RSVP-TE FEC of the 
          reference LSP who's Path is be used to expand the route of the 
          LSP being signaled. Specifically,   

          Tunnel ID  
                
               Tunnel ID of the reference LSP who's Path is be used to 
               expand the route of the LSP being signaled. 

          Extended Tunnel ID  
                
               Extended Tunnel ID of the reference LSP who's Path is be 
               used to expand the route of the LSP being signaled. 

          IPv4 tunnel sender address  
                
               IPv4 tunnel sender address of the reference LSP who's 
               path is be used to expand the route of the LSP being 
               signaled.

     2.2. IPv6 Point-to-Point LSP ERO subobject 

        The IPv6 Point-to-Point LSP ERO subobject is defined as follows:  

          0                   1                   2                   3

               If the bit is not set, the subobject represents a strict 
               hop in the explicit route.  

               This document only defines the use of the subobject in 
               loose hopes in the ERO, i.e., L bit MUST of set to 1.  

          Type  
           
               IPv6 Point-to-Point LSP subobject 
               (to be assigned by IANA; suggested value: 39). 
           

          Length 

              The length contains the total length of the subobject in 
              bytes, including the type and length fields. The length is 
              always 48. 

          Inclusion Flags  
           
               The Inclusion Flags are as defined for the IPv4 Point-to-
               Point LSP XRO subobject.  
           
          The remaining fields are used to specific RSVP-TE FEC of the 
          reference LSP who's Path is be used to expand the route of the 
          LSP being signaled.  

     2.3. Processing rules for LSP ERO subobjects 

        The basic processing rules of an ERO are not altered.  Please 
        refer to [RFC3209] for details.  

        If an LSR strips all local subobjects from an ERO carried in a 
        Path message (according to the procedures in [RFC3209]) and 
        finds that the next subobject is an IPv4 P2P LSP subobject or 
        IPv6 P2P LSP subject, it MUST attempt to resolve the LSP 
        subobject as described in the following.  

        If the L bit of the LSP subobject is not set, i.e., the 
        subobject represents a strict hop in the explicit route, the 
        processing node MUST respond with a PathErr message with the 
        error code "Routing Problem" (24) and the error value "Bad 
        initial subobject" (4).

        If the inclusion flags of the LSP subobject is set to "mandatory 
        inclusion", the processing node follows the following procedure: 

        - If the path taken by the LSP referenced in the LSP subobject 
          is known to the processing node and the path contains the 
          loose abstract node in the ERO hop, the processing node MUST 
          ensure that loose hop expansion to the next abstract node 
          follows the referenced path.  

        - If the path taken by the LSP referenced in the LSP subobject 
          is unknown to the processing node or the referenced path does 
          not contain the loose abstract node in the ERO hop, the 
          processing node MUST sent a PathErr message with the error 
          code "Routing Problem" (24) and the new error value "unknown 
          or inconsistent LSP suboject" (value to be assigned by IANA) 
          for the signaled LSP.  

        If the inclusion flags of the LSP subobject is set to "best-
        effort inclusion", the processing node follows the following 
        procedure: 

        - If the path taken by the LSP referenced in the LSP subobject 
          is known to the processing node and the path contains the 
          loose abstract node in the ERO hop, the processing node 
          SHOULD ensure that loose hop expansion to the next abstract 
          node follows the referenced path.  

        - If the path taken by the LSP referenced in the LSP subobject 
          is unknown to the processing node and/ or the referenced path 
          does not contain the loose abstract node in the ERO hop, the 
          processing node SHOULD ignore the route inclusion specified 
          in the LSP subobject and SHOULD compute a suitable path to 
          the loose abstract node in the ERO hop and proceed with the 
          signaling request. After sending the Resv for the signaled 
          LSP, the processing node SHOULD return a PathErr with the 
          error code "Notify Error" (25) and error sub-code " unknown 
          or inconsistent LSP suboject" (value to be assigned by IANA) 
          for the signaled LSP. 

     3. Security Considerations 

        This document does not introduce any additional security issues 
        above those identified in [RFC5920], [RFC2205], [RFC3209], and 
        [RFC3473] and [RFC4874].

     4. IANA Considerations 

     4.1. New ERO subobject types 

        This document adds the following new subobject of the existing 
        entry for ERO (20, EXPLICIT_ROUTE):  

        Value                      Description 

        -----                      ------------ 

        TBA                        IPv4 Point-to-Point LSP ERO subobject 

        TBA                        IPv6 Point-to-Point LSP ERO subobject 

        These subobject may be present in the Explicit Route Object, but 
        not in the Route Record Object.  

         
     4.2. New RSVP error sub-codes  

        IANA registry: RSVP PARAMETERS 
        Subsection: Error Codes and Globally-Defined Error Value Sub-
        Codes  
         
        For Error Code "Routing Problem" (24) (see [RFC3209]) the 
        following sub-codes are defined. 
         
        Sub-code                               Value 
        --------                               ----- 
      
        Unknown or inconsistent LSP suboject      To be assigned by 
     IANA. 
         
        For Error Code "Notify Error" (25) (see [RFC3209]) the following 
        sub-codes are defined. 
         
         
        Sub-code                               Value 
        --------                               ----- 
      
        Unknown or inconsistent LSP suboject      To be assigned by 
     IANA.
