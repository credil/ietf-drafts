1.  Introduction

   Detecting MPLS Data Plane Failures [RFC4379] defines mechanisms for
   collecting downstream mapping information using Downstream Mapping
   (DSMAP) TLV.  However, it does not describe a method by which similar
   information can be captured for the upstream mapping.  An operator
   would generally be interested in the path taken by a packet in both
   the downstream and the upstream direction.  Currently the only way
   the operator would be able to get that information would be by
   running the same command from the other end point.  This document
   describes a method by which both Downstream Mapping (DSMAP) and
   Upstream Mapping (UPMAP) information can be collected by the same
   device.

2.  Motivation

   Detecting MPLS Data Plane Failures [RFC4379], describes the method by
   which an operator can find a fault in a bidirectional LSP.  The
   operator starts by issuing a traceroute command from a node in the
   network to a node that is beyond the failed node.  The operator then
   has to issue the same command from the node that was targeted in the
   first command.  In many cases, the operator does not have access to
   the other node in the network.  The operator is however interested in
   both the upstream and downstream LSP.  This draft suggests a method
   by which the operator can issue a single traceroute command from one
   of the nodes in the network and mpls echo request and response packet
   will carry information to validate both the DSMAP and UPMAP
   information.  The UPMAP can only be used in case of a bidirectional
   LSP, where the Forward LSP and the Reverse LSP share their path.
   When used in a non-bidirectional LSP, the UPMAP information will be
   filled with zeros and SHOULD be ignored on reception.  A router that
   does not support the UPMAP TLV will silently ignore the TLV.

3.  Packet format

   The packet format is similar to the packet format described in
   Section 3 of RCF4379.  [RFC4379]

   This draft proposes to add two new return codes as outlined in
   section and a new TLV as specified in section .

3.2.  Upstream TLV

Internet-Draft              Upstream mapping                October 2013


   The upstream mapping TLV is an object that MUST be included for all
   reply modes in the MPLS Echo packet when the operator has requested a
   traceroute on a bidirectional LSP, where the Forward LSP and Reverse
   LSP share the same path.  The presence of an upstream TLV by the
   requester means that the replying router SHOULD validate the upstream
   TLV and if correct, fill the upstream TLV with upstream FEC of the
   replying router.  If incorrect, it should fill the return code with
   one of the values specified in section to indicate "Upstream Mapping
   Mismatch" and leave the upstream TLV as is.  If the node is an LER
   router and the upstream TLV is included in the MPLS echo request
   packet, it SHOULD fill the upstream TLV with the appropriate
   information and MUST include it in the MPLS echo reply.

   As defined in RFC 4379, the length of this TLV is K + M + 4*N octets,
   where M is the Multipath Length, and N is the number of Downstream
   Labels.  Values for K are found in the description of Address Type
   below.  The Value field of a Upstream TLV has the following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   Upstream IP Address and Upstream Interface Address

   IPv4 addresses and interface indices are encoded in 4 octets; IPv6
   addresses are encoded in 16 octets.  If the interface to the upstream
   node is numbered, then the Address Type MUST be set to IPv4 or IPv6,

Internet-Draft              Upstream mapping                October 2013


   the Upstream IP Address MUST be set to either the Upstream node's
   Router ID or the interface address of the Upstream node, and the
   Upstream Interface Address MUST be set to the upstream node's
   interface address.  If the interface to the upstream node is
   unnumbered, the Address Type MUST be IPv4 Unnumbered or IPv6
   Unnumbered, the Upstream IP Address MUST be the upstream node's
   Router ID, and the Upstream Interface Address MUST be set to the
   index assigned by the node to the interface.

   If a node does not know the IP address of its neighbor, then it MUST
   set the Address Type to either IPv4 Unnumbered or IPv6 Unnumbered.
   For IPv4, it must set the Upstream IP Address to 127.0.0.1; for IPv6
   the address is set to 0::1.  In both cases, the interface index MUST
   be set to 0.

   Upstream Label(s)

   The set of labels in the label stack should appear as if this router
   were forwarding the packet through this interface.  Any Implicit Null
   labels are explicitly included.  Labels are treated as numbers, i.e.,
   they are right justified in the field.

   A Upstream Label is 24 bits, in the same format as an MPLS label
   minus the TTL field, i.e., the MSBit of the label is bit 0, the LSBit
   is bit 19, the EXP bits are bits 20-22, and bit 23 is the S bit.  The
   replying router SHOULD fill in the EXP and S bits; the LSR receiving
   the echo reply MAY choose to ignore these bits.

   For explanation of rest of the fields in the Upstream TLV please
   refer section 3.3 of Detecting MPLS Data Plane Failures [RFC4379].

4.  Theory of Operations

4.1.  Usefulness of Upstream TLV in a Bidirectional LSP sharing the same
      path

   The Upstream TLV MUST only be used in case of a bidirectional LSP
   where Forward and Reverse Paths are same, for example, MPLS-TP Co-
   routed tunnels or Multisegment Pseudo wire.  In which case, the
   transit nodes will know all the information required to fill both the
   Downstream Mapping TLV and Upstream TLV.

   Consider the following example:

   +------+L0         L0+------+L1        L1+------+
   |      |------------>|      |----------->|      |
   | LER1 |             | LSR1 |            | LER2 |
   |      |<------------|      |<-----------|      |

Internet-Draft              Upstream mapping                October 2013


   +------+L3         L3+------+L2        L2+------+


   In the above fig, LER1 is the ingress node with forward out going
   label L0 and reverse in coming label of L3.  LSR1 is the transit
   router with forward incoming and outgoing labels as L0 and L1
   respectively and reverse incoming and outgoing labels of L2 and L3
   respectively.  LER2 is the egress router with forward incoming label
   of L1 and reverse outgoing label of L2.

   The ingress node SHOULD fill its Downstream TLV for label L0 and
   Upstream TLV for label L3.  When this MPLS Echo request packet
   (containing the Upstream TLV and the DownStream TLV) reaches the
   transit node, then the node validates both Upstream TLV for label L3
   and Downstream TLV for Label L0.  If the Downstream TLV for label L0
   specified in the packet does not match the information the transit
   node has, then the transit node sends a return code specifying
   Downstream TLV mismatch.  Similarly, if the Upstream TLV specified in
   the packet does not match the Upstream information the transit node
   has, then the transit node SHOULD send a return code of Upstream TLV
   mismatch.  If both, the Upstream TLV and Downstream TLV does not
   match then the transit node should send a return code of Upstream and
   Downstream TLV mismatch.  And if both the TLVs match then the transit
   node populates it's Downstream Mapping for label L1 and the Upstream
   Mapping for label L2 and sends the reply back to the ingress node.
   The ingress node uses this new Downstream TLV and Upstream TLV in
   it's next Echo Request packet.  The egress node on receiving the Echo
   Request packet validates Upstream TLV and Downstream TLV.  If both
   the TLVs match then the egress node SHOULD send a return code of
   Replying router is egress, else it SHOULD send the return code
   depending on which TLV did not match.

   In case a bidirectional LSP does not share the Forward and Reverse
   path, for example, MPLS-TP Associated LSPs, traceroute SHOULD NOT add
   Upstream TLV as part of the MPLS Echo Request.  If the Forward and
   Reverse LSPs are not on the same node then the transit node of the
   Forward LSP won't have any information to fill the Upstream TLV.

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations, as discussed in Detecting MPLS Data Plane
   Failures [RFC4379], are applicable to this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  New TLV

   IANA would have to assign a new TLV value to the following TLV from
   the "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters" registry, "TLVs and sub-TLVs" sub-
   registry.

   Upstream Detailed Mapping TLV (see Section ).

6.2.  New Returns Codes

   IANA needs to assign a new Return Code values from the "Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping
   Parameters" registry, "Return Codes" sub-registry, as follows using a
   Standards Action value.
