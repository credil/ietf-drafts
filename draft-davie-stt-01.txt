1.  Introduction

   Network Virtualization places unique requirements on tunneling
   protocols.  The utility of tunneling in virtualized data centers has
   been described elsewhere; see, for example
   [I-D.narten-nvo3-overlay-problem-statement], [VL2],
   [I-D.mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan],
   [I-D.sridharan-virtualization-nvgre].  Tunneling allows a virtual
   overlay topology to be constructed on top of the physical data center
   network, and provides benefits such as:

   o  Ability to manage overlapping addresses between multiple tenants

   o  Decoupling of the virtual topology provided by the tunnels from
      the physical topology of the network

   o  Support for virtual machine mobility independent of the physical
      network

   o  Support for essentially unlimited numbers of virtual networks (in
      contrast to VLANs, for example)

   o  Decoupling of the network service provided to servers from the
      technology used in the physical network (e.g. providing an L2
      service over an L3 fabric)

   o  Isolating the physical network from the addressing of the virtual
      networks, thus avoiding issues such as MAC table size in physical
      switches.

   This draft describes STT (Stateless Transport Tunneling), a tunnel
   encapsulation that enables overlay networks to be built in
   virtualized data center networks, providing the benefits outlined
   above.  STT is particularly useful when some tunnel endpoints are in
   end-systems, as it utilizes the capabilities of standard network
   interface cards to improve performance.  STT is an IP-based
   encapsulation and utilizes a TCP-like header inside the IP header.
   It is, however, stateless, i.e., there is no TCP connection state of
   any kind associated with the tunnel.  The TCP-like header is used for
   pragmatic reasons, to leverage the capabilities of existing network
   interface cards, but should not be interpreted as implying any sort
   of connection state between endpoints.

   STT is typically used to carry Ethernet frames between tunnel
   endpoints.  These frames may be considerably larger than the MTU of
   the physical network - up to 64KB.  Fields in the tunnel header are
   used to allow these large frames to be segmented at the entrance to
   the tunnel according to the MTU of the physical network and

   subsequently reassembled at the far end of the tunnel.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:

   Stateless Transport Tunneling (STT).  The tunneling mechanism defined
   in this document.  The name derives from the fact that the tunnel
   header resembles the TCP/IP headers (hence "transport" tunneling)
   while "stateless" refers to the fact that none of the normal TCP
   state (connection state, send and receive windows, congestion state
   etc.) is associated with the tunnel (as would be required if an
   actual TCP connection were used for tunneling).

   STT Frame.  The unit of data that is passed into the tunnel prior to
   segmentation and encapsulation.  This frame typically consists of an
   Ethernet frame and an STT Frame header.  These frames may be up to
   64KB in size.

   STT Segment.  The unit of data that is transmitted on the underlay
   network over which the tunnel operates.  An STT segment has headers
   that are syntactically the same as the TCP/IP headers, and typically
   contains part of an STT frame as the payload.  These segments must
   fit within the MTU of the physical network.

   Context ID.  A 64-bit field in the STT frame header that conveys
   information about the disposition of the STT frame between the tunnel
   endpoints.  One example use of the Context ID is to direct delivery
   of the STT frame payload to the appropriate virtual network or
   virtual machine.

   MSS.  Maximum Segment Size.  The maximum number of bytes that can be
   sent in one TCP segment [RFC0793].

   NIC.  Network Interface Card.

   TSO.  TCP Segmentation Offload.  A function provided by many
   commercial NICs that allows large data units to be passed to the NIC,
   the NIC being responsible for creating MSS-sized segments with
   correct TCP/IP headers.

   LRO.  Large Receive Offload.  The receive-side equivalent function of

   TSO, in which multiple TCP segments are coalesced into larger data
   units.

   VM.  Virtual Machine.

1.3.  Reference Model

   Our conceptual model for a virtualized network is shown in Figure 1.
   STT tunnels extend in this figure from one virtual switch to another,
   providing a virtual link between the switches over some arbitrary
   underlay.  More generally, STT tunnels operate between a pair of
   tunnel endpoints; these endpoints may be virtual switches, physical
   switches, or some other device (e.g. an appliance).  The STT tunnel
   provides a virtual point-to-point Ethernet link between the
   endpoints.  Frames are handed to the tunnel by some entity (e.g. a VM
   that is connected to a virtual switch in this picture) and first
   encapsulated with an STT Frame header.  STT Frames may then be
   fragmented in the NIC, and are encapsulated with a tunnel header (the
   STT segment header) for transmission over the underlay.  Note that
   other models are possible, e.g., where one or both tunnel endpoints
   are implemented in a physical switch.  In such cases the tunnel
   endpoint may forward packets to and from another link (physical or
   virtual) rather than to a VM.

2.  Design Rationale

   We take as given the need for some form of tunneling to support the
   virtualization of the network as described in Section 1.  One might
   reasonably ask whether some existing tunneling protocol such as
   GRE[RFC2784] or L2TPv3[RFC3931] might suffice.  In fact,



Davie & Gross           Expires September 6, 2012               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              The STT Protocol                  March 2012


   [I-D.sridharan-virtualization-nvgre] does just that, using GRE.  The
   primary motivation for STT as opposed to one of the existing
   tunneling methods is to improve the performance of data transfers
   from hosts that implement tunnel endpoints.  We expand on this
   rationale below.

2.1.  Segmentation Offload

   A large percentage of network interface cards (NICs) in use today are
   able to perform TCP segmentation offload (TSO).  When a NIC supports
   TSO, the host hands a large (greater than 1 TCP MSS) frame of data to
   the NIC along with a set of metadata which includes, among other
   things, the desired MSS, and various fields needed to complete the
   TCP header.  The NIC fragments the frame into MSS-sized segments,
   performs the TCP Checksum operation, and applies the appropriate
   headers (TCP, IP and MAC) to each segment.

   On the receive side, some NICs support the reassembly of TCP
   segments, a function referred to as large receive offload (LRO).  In
   this case, NICs attempt to reassemble TCP segments and pass larger
   aggregates of data to the host.  (Since TCP's service model is a byte
   stream, there is no higher level frame for the NIC to reassemble, but
   it can pass chunks of the stream larger than one MSS to the host.
   Full reassembly of STT frames is handled in the host.)  The benefits
   to the host include fewer per-packet operations and larger data
   transfers between host and NIC, which amortizes the per-transfer cost
   (such as interrupt processing) more efficiently.  These gains can
   translate into significant performance gains for data transfer from
   the host to the network.

   STT is explicitly designed to leverage the TSO capabilities of
   currently available NICs.  While one might think of segmentation as a
   generic function, the majority of NICs are designed specifically to
   support TCP segmentation offload, as the details of the segmentation
   function are highly dependent on the specifics of TCP.  In order to
   leverage such capability, therefore, the STT segment header is
   syntactically identical to a valid TCP header.  However, we use some
   of the fields in the TCP header (specifically, sequence number and
   ACK number) to support the objectives of STT.  The details are
   described in Section 3.2.  In essence, we need the same set of
   information that IP datagrams carry when IP fragmentation takes
   place: a unique identifier for the frame that has been fragmented, an
   offset into that frame for the current fragment, and the length of
   the frame to be reassembled.  We fit these fields into the TCP header
   fields traditionally used for the SEQ and ACK numbers.  STT segments
   are transmitted as IP datagrams using the TCP protocol number (6).
   The primary means to recognize STT segments is the destination port
   number.  We discuss the interoperability impact of these design

   choices in Section 4.

   The net effect of using TSO is that the frame size that is sent by
   endpoints in the virtualized network can be much larger than the MTU
   of the underlying physical network.  The primary benefit of this is a
   significant performance gain when large amounts of data are being
   transferred between nodes in the virtual network.  A secondary effect
   is that the header of the STT frame is amortized across a larger
   amount of data, reducing the need to shrink the STT frame header to
   minimum size.

   Note that, while segmentation offload is the primary NIC function
   that STT takes advantage of, other NIC offload functions such as
   checksum calculation can also be leveraged.

2.2.  Metadata

   When a frame is delivered to the NIC that supports TSO for
   segmentation and transmission, a certain amount of metadata is
   typically passed along with it.  This includes the MSS and
   potentially a VLAN tag to be applied to the transmitted packets.

   In some virtualized network deployments, an STT frame may traverse a
   tunnel, be received and reassembled at an STT endpoint, and then be
   sent on another physical interface.  In such cases, the tunnel
   terminating endpoint may need to pass metadata to a NIC to enable
   transmission of frames on the physical link.  For this reason,
   appropriate metadata is carried in the STT frame header.

2.3.  Context Information

   When an STT Frame is received by a tunnel endpoint, it needs to be
   directed to the appropriate entity in the virtualized network to
   which it belongs.  For this reason, a Context ID is required in the
   STT frame header.  Some other encapsulations (e.g.
   [I-D.mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan],
   [I-D.sridharan-virtualization-nvgre]) use an explicit tenant network
   identifier or virtual network identifier.  The Context Identifier can
   be thought of as a generalized form of virtual network identifier.
   Using a larger and more general identifier allows for a broader range
   of service models and allows ample room for future expansion.  There
   is little downside to using a larger field here because it is
   amortized across the entire STT Frame rather than being present in
   each packet.

2.4.  Alignment

   Software implementations of tunnel endpoints benefit from 32-bit
   alignment of the data to be manipulated.  Because the Ethernet header
   is not a multiple of 32-bits (it is 14 bytes), 2 bytes of padding are
   added to the STT header, causing the payload beyond the encapsulated
   Ethernet header, which typically includes the IP header of the
   encapsulated frame, to be 32-bit aligned.

2.5.  Equal Cost Multipath

   It is essential that traffic passing through the physical network can
   be efficiently distributed across multiple paths.  Standard equal
   cost multipath (ECMP) techniques involve hashing on address and port
   numbers in the outer protocol headers.  There are two main issues to
   address with ECMP.  First, it is important that, when a set of
   packets belong to a single flow (e.g. a TCP connection in the virtual
   network), all those packets should follow the same path.  Second, all
   paths should be used efficiently, i.e. there needs to be sufficient
   entropy among the different flows to ensure they get distributed
   evenly across multiple paths.

   STT achieves the first goal by ensuring that the source and
   destination ports and addresses in the outer header are all the same
   for a single flow.  The second goal is achieved by generating the
   source port using a random hash of fields in the headers of the inner
   packets, e.g. the ports and addresses of the virtual flow's packets.
   We provide more details on the usage of port numbers in Section 3.2.

2.6.  Efficient Software Processing

   The design of STT is largely motivated by the desire to tunnel
   packets efficiently between virtual switches running in software.  In
   addition to the points noted above, this leads to some design
   optimizations to simplify processing of packets, such as the use of
   an "L4 offset" field in the STT header to enable the payload to be
   located quickly without extensive header parsing.


3.  Frame Formats

   STT encapsulates data payloads of up to 64KB (limited by the length
   field in the STT header, described below).  Those frames are then
   segmented (depending on the MTU of the underlying physical network)
   and the resulting segments are encapsulated in a standard TCP header,
   which in turn is encapsulated by an IP header and finally a MAC
   header.  This is illustrated in Figure 2.

   Original data           STT Frame is segmented and transmitted as
   frame is encapped           a set of TCP segments (MAC
   with STT Header                 headers not shown)


              Figure 2: STT Frame Fragments and Encapsulation

   The details of the STT Frame header and the usage of the TCP-like
   header are described in detail below.  The TCP segments shown in
   Figure 2 are of course further encapsulated as IP datagrams, and may
   be sent as either IPv4 or IPv6.  The resulting IP datagrams are then
   transmitted in the appropriate MAC level frame (e.g.  Ethernet, not
   shown in the figure) for the underlying physical network over which
   the tunnels are established.

   The STT frame header contains the following fields:

   o  Version - currently 0.

   o  Flags - describes encapsulated packet, see below.

   o  L4 offset - offset in bytes from the end of the STT Frame header
      to the start of the encapsulated layer 4 (TCP/UDP) header.

   o  Reserved field - MUST be zero on transmission and ignored on
      receipt.

   o  Max Segment Size - the TCP MSS that should be used by a tunnel
      endpoint that is transmitting this frame onto another network.

   o  PCP - the 3-bit Priority Code Point field that should be applied
      to this packet by an STT tunnel endpoint on transmission to
      another network (see Section 2.2).

   o  V - a one bit flag that, if set, indicates the presence of a valid
      VLAN ID in the following field and valid PCP in the preceding
      field.

   o  VLAN ID - 12-bit VLAN tag that should be applied to this packet by
      an STT tunnel endpoint on transmission to another network (see
      Section 2.2).

   o  Context ID - 64 bits of context information, described in detail
      in Section 2.3.

   o  Padding - 16 bits as described above.

   The flags field contains:

   o  0: Checksum verified.  Set if the checksum of the encapsulated
      packet has been verified by the sender.

   o  1: Checksum partial.  Set if the checksum in the encapsulated
      packet has been computed only over the TCP/IP header.  This bit
      MUST be set if TSO is used by the sender.  Note that bit 0 and bit
      1 cannot both be set in the same header.

   o  2: IP version.  Set if the encapsulated packet is IPv4, not set if
      the packet is IPv6.  See below for discussion of non-IP payloads.

   o  3: TCP payload.  Set if the encapsulated packet is TCP.

   o  4-7: Unused, MUST be zero on transmission and ignored on receipt.

   As noted above, several of these fields are present primarily to
   enable efficient processing of the packet when it received at a
   tunnel endpoint.  (For example, it's entirely possible to determine
   if the packet is IPv4 or IPv6 by looking at the Ethernet header -
   it's just more efficient not to have to do so.)

   The payload of the STT frame is an untagged Ethernet frame.

3.1.1.  Handling non-IP payloads

   Note that the STT header does not have a general "protocol" field to
   allow the efficient processing of arbitrary payloads.  The current
   version is designed to provide a virtual Ethernet link, and hence
   efficiently supports only Ethernet frames as the payload.  The
   Ethernet header itself contains a protocol field, which then
   identifies the higher layer protocol, so it is straightforward to
   accommodate non-IP traffic.

   It will be noted that the STT Frame header does contain fields that
   are intended to assist in efficient processing of IPv4 and IPv6
   packets.  These fields MUST be set to zero and ignored on receipt for
   non-IP payloads.

   The use of STT to carry payloads other than Ethernet is theoretically
   possible but is beyond the scope of this document.

3.2.  Usage of TCP Header by STT

   Figure 4 illustrates the usage of the TCP header STT.  This figure is
   essentially identical to that in [RFC0793] with the exception that we
   denote with an asterisk (*) two fields that are used by STT to convey
   something other than the information that is conveyed by TCP.
   Syntactically, STT segments look identical to TCP segments.  However,
   STT tunnel endpoints treat the Sequence number and Acknowledgment
   number differently than TCP endpoints treat those fields.
   Furthermore, as noted above, there is no TCP state machine associated
   with an STT tunnel.

                       Figure 4: STT Segment Format

   The Destination port is to be requested from IANA, in the user range
   (1024-49151).

   In order to allow correct reassembly of the STT frame, the source
   port MUST be constant for all segments of a single STT frame.

   As noted above (Section 2.5) the source port SHOULD be the same for
   all frames that belong to a single flow in the virtual network, e.g.
   a single TCP connection.

   Also, to encourage efficient distribution of traffic among multiple
   paths when ECMP is used, the method to calculate the source port
   should provide a random distribution of source port numbers.  An

   example mechanism would be a random hash on ports and addresses of
   the TCP headers of the flow in the virtual network.

   It is RECOMMENDED to use a source port number from the ephemeral
   range defined by IANA (49152-65535).

   The Sequence number and Acknowledgment number fields are re-purposed
   in a way that does not confuse NICs that expect them to be used in
   the conventional manner.  The ACK field is used as a packet
   identifier for the purposes of fragmentation, equivalent in function
   to the Identification field of IPv4 or the IPv6 Fragment header: it
   MUST be constant for all STT segments of a given frame, and different
   from any value used recently for other STT frames sent over this
   tunnel.

   The upper 16 bits of the the SEQ field are used to convey the length
   of the STT frame in bytes.  The lower 16 bits of the SEQ field are
   used to convey the offset (in bytes) of the current fragment within
   the larger STT frame.

   Reassembly of the fragments may be done partially by NICs that
   perform LRO, since the sequence numbers of frames will increment
   appropriately.  That is, the upper 16 bits don't change, and the
   lower 16 bits increment by N for every N byte segment that is
   transmitted, just as would be the case if an actual sequence number
   were being sent.  Note that the size limit of an STT frame ensures
   that sequence numbers cannot wrap while sending the segments of a
   single STT frame.

   All the fields after ACK have their conventional meaning, although
   nothing will be done with the Window or Urgent pointer values.  Those
   fields SHOULD be zero on transmit and ignored on receipt.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the PSH (Push) flag be set when transmitting the
   last segment of a frame in order to cause data to be delivered by the
   NIC without waiting for other fragments.  The ACK flag SHOULD be set
   to ensure that a receiving NIC passes the ACK field to the host to
   assist in reassembly.  All other flags SHOULD be zero on transmit and
   ignored on receipt.

3.3.  Encapsulation of STT Segments in IP

   From the perspective of IP, an STT segment is just like any other TCP
   segment.  The protocol number (IPv4) or Next Header (IPv6) has the
   value 6, as for regular TCP.  The resulting IP datagram is then
   encapsulated in the appropriate L2 header (e.g.  Ethernet) for
   transmission on the physical medium.

Internet-Draft              The STT Protocol                  March 2012


3.3.1.  Diffserv and ECN-Marking

   When traffic is encapsulated in a tunnel header, there are numerous
   options as to how the Diffserv Code-Point (DSCP) and ECN markings are
   set in the outer header and propagated to the inner header on
   decapsulation.

   [RFC2983] defines two modes for mapping the DSCP markings from inner
   to outer headers and vice versa.  The Uniform model copies the inner
   DSCP marking to the outer header on tunnel ingress, and copies that
   outer header value back to the inner header at tunnel egress.  The
   Pipe model sets the DSCP value to some value based on local policy at
   ingress and does not modify the inner header on egress.  Both models
   SHOULD be supported by STT endpoints.  However, there is an
   additional complexity with the uniform model for STT, because a
   single IP datagram that is transmitted over the tunnel appears as
   multiple IP datagrams on the wire.  Thus it is not guaranteed that
   all segments of the STT frame will have the same DSCP at egress.  If
   uniform model behavior is configured, it is RECOMMENDED that the DSCP
   of the first segment of the STT frame be used to set the DSCP value
   of the IP header in the decapsulated STT frame.

   [RFC6040] describes the correct ECN behavior for any type of IP in IP
   tunnel, and this behavior SHOULD be followed for STT tunnels.  As
   with the Uniform Diffserv tunnel model, the fact that one inner IP
   datagram is segmented into multiple outer datagrams makes the
   situation slightly more complex.  It is RECOMMENDED that if any
   segment of the received STT frame has the CE (congestion experienced)
   bit set in its IP header, then the CE bit SHOULD be set in the IP
   header of the decapsulated STT frame.

3.3.2.  Packet Loss

   Individual IP datagrams may be dropped (most often due to congestion)
   and, since there is no acknowledgment or reliable delivery of these
   datagrams, there is the potential to corrupt an entire STT Frame due
   to the loss of a single IP datagram.  Fortunately, there are
   solutions to this problem in the case where the higher layer protocol
   running over STT is TCP.  An STT receiving endpoint running in an
   end-system, as shown in Figure 1 for example, is not required to
   deliver complete STT frames to the TCP stack in the receiving VM.  A
   partial frame payload can be delivered and the receiving TCP stack
   can deal with the missing bytes just as it would if running directly
   over a physical network.  That is, TCP in the VM can send ACKs for
   the contiguous bytes received to trigger retransmission of the
   missing bytes by the sender.  This is similar to the operation of LRO
   in current NICs.  There are some subtleties to making this work
   correctly in the STT context, and it does depend on the STT endpoint

   being aware of the higher layer protocols consuming data in the VM to
   which it is connected.  The main point of this discussion is that, in
   the common deployments of STT running in a virtual switch, the
   potential harm of losing individual packets is not as serious as it
   might first appear.

3.4.  Broadcast and Multicast

   It is possible to establish point-to-multipoint STT tunnels by using
   an IP multicast address as the destination address of the tunnel.
   These may be used for broadcast or multicast traffic if the
   underlying physical network supports IP multicast.  Control
   mechanisms for setting up such multicast groups are beyond the scope
   of this document.  It is worth repeating that, despite the syntactic
   resemblance between the STT segment header and the TCP header, there
   is no TCP state machine associated with an STT tunnel, so the
   traditional issues of combining multicast with TCP (or reliable
   transports more generally) do not arise.


4.  Interoperability Issues

   It will be noted that an STT packet on the wire appears exactly the
   same as a TCP packet, but that processing of an STT packet on
   reception is entirely different from TCP - no three-way handshake to
   establish a connection, no ACKs, retransmission, etc.  Hence, an STT
   tunnel endpoint clearly needs to be configured to behave in the
   correct manner rather than to perform standard TCP processing on the
   packet.  The primary way to recognize an STT segment is the
   destination port number in the TCP header.  In the event that an STT
   packet is inadvertently delivered to a device that is not configured
   to behave as an STT tunnel endpoint, no TCP connection will be
   established and STT packets will be dropped.

   In the event that STT packets pass through middle boxes that process
   TCP, it is likely that (in the near term at least) they will be
   dropped, as there will be no TCP connection state established.  This
   is clearly undesirable, but it is a general issue with any form of
   tunneling - the nature of many middle boxes is that they will not
   permit tunnels to pass through them.  Hence the best solution is
   simply to avoid deploying middle boxes at locations where STT tunnels
   (or other forms of tunnels for network virtualization) will need to
   pass through them.  This will not, however, always be feasible,
   especially when virtualized networks extend among multiple data
   centers.  Other solutions include configuring the middle boxes to
   permit TCP packets to pass through when the port number matches the
   port assigned for STT.

Internet-Draft              The STT Protocol                  March 2012


   In the longer term, we might reasonably expect that middle boxes
   would be able to recognize STT traffic, and to terminate and
   originate STT tunnels if necessary (e.g. to perform functions that
   require the STT payload to be inspected such as statefull
   firewalling).

   It is also of course possible to provide all the functionality of STT
   using a different IP protocol number (or next header value in IPv6).
   This approach makes sense in the long run but will typically not
   enable current NIC hardware to be leveraged for TSO and LRO
   functions.

   It is also possible to run STT traffic over other forms of tunnel
   (GRE, IPSEC, etc.) in which case they the STT traffic can pass
   through appropriately configured middle boxes.


5.  IANA Considerations

   A TCP port in the user range (1024- 49151) will be requested from
   IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   In the physical network, STT packets are simply IP datagrams, and do
   not introduce new security issues.  Most standard IP security
   mechanisms (such as IPSEC encryption or authentication) can be
   implemented on STT packets if desired.  As noted above, however,
   tunneling generally interacts poorly with middle boxes, and STT is no
   exception.  Devices such as firewalls are likely to drop STT traffic
   unless the capability to recognize STT packets is implemented, or
   unless the STT traffic is itself run over some sort of tunnel that
   the firewall is configured to permit.  Intrusion detection systems
   would similarly need to be enhanced to be able to look inside STT
   packets.

   It should also be noted that while STT packets resemble TCP segments,
   the lack of a TCP state machine means that TCP-related security
   issues (e.g.  SYN-flooding) do not apply.  Similarly, some of the
   benefits of the TCP state machine (e.g. the ability to discard
   packets with unexpected sequence numbers) are also absent for STT
   traffic.
