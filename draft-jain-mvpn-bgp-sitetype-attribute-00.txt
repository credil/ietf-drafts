               BGP Extension for MVPN Site-Type Attribute
               draft-jain-mvpn-bgp-sitetype-attribute-00

Abstract

   This document defines a new BGP attribute in BGP based multicast VPN,
   that allows a MVPN PE router to inform the rest of MVPN PE routers
   whether it is a sender site/receiver site and there by avoid all
   other PEs from setting up P-tunnels to the sender site PE.  This
   would reduce control plane states in the network and allow efficient
   network bandwidth utilization .

1.  Introduction

   RFC 6513 defines sender site and receiver site in MVPN as mentioned
   below.

   An MVPN is defined by two sets of sites: the Sender Sites set and the
   Receiver Sites set, with the following properties:

   o  Hosts within the Sender Sites set could originate multicast
      traffic for receivers in the Receiver Sites set.

   o  Receivers not in the Receiver Sites set should not be able to
      receive this traffic.

   o  Hosts within the Receiver Sites set could receive multicast
      traffic originated by any host in the Sender Sites set

   o  Hosts within the Receiver Sites set should not be able to receive
      multicast traffic originated by any host that is not in the Sender
      Sites set

   With this definition the sender sites does not receive traffic but
   still can have terminating P-tunnels, which causes traffic in RSVP
   P2MP I-PMSI tunnel to be forwarded to a sender site from another
   sender or sender-receiver site which eventually gets dropped at the
   sender site.  The following are the few disadvantages associated with
   the above approach.

   o  unnecessary RSVP control plane states in the network based

   o  inefficient network resource utilization.

   This document addresses the above disadvantage by adding a new BGP
   attribute to the BGP I-PMSI A-D route which will inform other PEs
   that a site is sender site or receiver site, there by preventing
   setting up of P-Tunnels to the sender site.

2.  Terminology

   Terminology used in this document:

   Sender PE: PE closest to the Multicast Source (This could be either
   directly connected to Multicast Source or via some network).
   P-Tunnel would be originating at this node.  This P-Tunnel could be
   Inclusive or Selective..

   Receiver PE: PE Node closest to the Multicast Receiver (This could be
   either directly connected to Multicast Source or via some network).
   P-Tunnel would be terminating at this node.

   Other terminologies are as defined in [RFC6513] and [RFC6514].

3.  MVPN sender site

   MVPN setup with sender site, receiver site and sender-receiver PEs




                                                                 (sender-receiver site)
                                +---+                            +-|-+
                                |   |                            |   |
                         (S)+---|PE1|- +      .--. .--.       +- |PE3|-----+(S)
                                |   |   \    (    '    '.--. /   |   |
                                +---+    \.-.' IP-MPLS      /    +-|-+
                         sender site
                                        (     network      )
                                +---+   / (             .'-'     +-|-+
                        (S)-----|   |  /   '--'. .'.    )  \     |   |
                                |PE2|-+        '--''--'     \    |PE4|
                                |   |                        +-- |   |
                                +---+                            +-|-+
                            sender site                      receiver site



   As seen in the above diagram, PE1 and PE2 are sender sites,PE3 is
   sender-receiver and PE4 is receiver site PE1 will have terminating
   I-PMSI P-Tunnels from PE2 and PE3.PE2 and PE3 will send traffic
   towards PE1 also through these P-Tunnels.  Since PE1 is a sender
   site, traffic received on the I-PMSI tunnels will be dropped.

   The P-Tunnel which is setup to PE1 causes unnecessary control plane
   states in the core network

   If there is a way to inform PE2 and PE3 that PE1 is a sender site,
   then these PEs will not originate I-PMSI P-tunnel to PE1 and thus
   conserving network resources.

   This document defines a new BGP attribute to be advertised to all PEs
   in the I-PMSI A-D route, which will inform the site-type of a PE.

4.  MVPN Site-type Attribute

   This document defines and uses a new BGP attribute called the "MVPN
   site-type attribute".  This is an optional transitive BGP attribute.
   The format of this attribute is defined as follows:


                +-------------------------------+
              |       Flags (1 octet)         |
              +-------------------------------+
              |  Site Type (2 octets) |
              +-------------------------------+

   IANA type code ( TBD)

   Site Type: The field will carry the value of the site type, the value
   can be one of the following

   o  00 -- sender receiver site type (Default)

   o  01 -- sender site

   o  02 -- receiver site

5.  Signaling procedures and usage considerations

5.1.  Originating PE Procedures

   A MVPN PE originating BGP I-PMSI A-D route will attach MVPN site-type
   attribute to the route.  This attribute is used to inform the route
   receiving PE if the originating PE is a sender site, receiver site or
   a sender-receiver site

   If the attribute is absent in the I-PMSI A-D route the originating PE
   will be considered as a sender-receiver site

   If a MVPN PE with existing P-tunnels to other PEs is changed to be a
   sender site or receiver site, a new I-PMSI A-D route needs to be send
   with the new MVPN site-type attribute.

5.2.  Receiving PE Procedures

   A MVPN PE receiving the I-PMSI A-D route with MVPN site-type
   attribute performs the below action based on the value of the site-
   type attribute.

   o  If the site-type attribute in the I-PMSI A-D route is received
      with value of sender site , then the route receiving PE does not
      include the PE which originated the I-PMSI A-D route as leaf.

   o  If the site-type attribute in the I-PMSI A-D route is received
      with value of receiver site, then the route receiving PE includes
      the PE which originated the I-PMSI A-D route as leaf.

   o  If the site-type attribute in the I-PMSI A-D route is received
      with value of sender-receiver, then the route receiving PE
      includes the PE which originated the I-PMSI A-D route as leaf.

   If the PE receiving the BGP Intra-AD route, already has a P-Tunnel to
   a given PE and then it receives new I-PMSI A-D Route with site-type
   attribute as sender site, it must accept the I-PMSI A-D Route and
   tear down the existing tunnels to the sender PE.

   If the PE receiving the BGP Intra-AD route has not established
   P-tunnel to a given PE since it is a sender site and if it receives a
   new I-PMSI A-D route from the PE without site-type attribute or with
   site-type attribute as receiver site or sender-receiver site, then it
   should set up a new P-tunnel to the PE.
