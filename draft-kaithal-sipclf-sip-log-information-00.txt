Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension  for  logging and debugging
              draft-kaithal-sipclf-sip-log-information-00

Abstract

   The current mechanisms to debug issues in SIP network are not very
   efficient.  It requires to enable debugging logs across different
   devices, recreate the problem and then collect the logs.  The idea is
   to provide a solution to automatically enable relevant logs (SIP
   messages and any other debugging logs meaningful to SIP devices), and
   also to indicate where the logs are to be collected or stored.  The
   enabling of logs will happen at all the SIP devices(upstream or
   downstream).  This will help to get the logs from all the SIP devices
   in a Common logging format (CLF).  The solution extends SIP to
   provide the infrastructure to enable logging for upstream and
   downstream devices with each server deciding how much troubleshooting
   information it wants to log - with freedom to simply ignore requests
   if required.  This document specifies a new header called "Log-Me"
   Header in all the SIP messages.

Internet-Draft       SIP based debugging and logging          April 2012


1.  Introduction

   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is gaining popularity in the VoIP
   Network.  Many deployments, currently, have deployed SIP for their
   VoIP network.  Because of the huge deployments, isolating the problem
   in the network and troubleshooting it becomes very difficult.  Also,
   If the problem happens in high traffic condition, or happens
   intermittently, collecting the right set of debugging logs is very
   difficult for further fault analysis.

   There is need for an effective troubleshooting mechanisms embedded in
   the signalling so that logs from all the devices can be collected for
   that particular call and stored in a common location for
   troubleshooting.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  This
   document only uses these key words when referencing normative
   statements in existing RFCs."


3.  Background

   Troubleshooting in VOIP network is challenging as the signaling and
   media follow different path and Different equipment.

   Scenario

   UA1----B2BUA1-----P1------P2-------B2BUA2------UA2

   UA1 wishes to make a call to UA2, However, due to network Topology,
   UA1 has to go via B2BUA1 ,Proxy 1 (P1) , Proxy2 (P2) and B2BUA2 to
   reach UA2.  Likewise, all requests between UA2 and UA1 must also
   traverse through the same path.

   UA1 makes a SIP call to UA2.  This call has some issue.  In order to
   debug the issue, logs need to be enabled at all the SIP devices in
   the network.  It involves a lot of time and effort collect the logs
   and troubleshoot it.

   The "Log-Me" extension header field allows all the SIP devices
   (upstream and downstream) to start collecting desired logs, store it
   in to a common location and available for debugging.  It may store
   the data in Common Logging Format so that It can be fed to a device

   which make the troubleshooting faster moreover the logs are in a
   standard format and easier to troubleshoot.  This header element's
   function is to invoke tracing and troubleshooting functions at each
   "hop" in the signaling path for the call.  Additionally, it includes
   a unique "tag" to allow the information to be associated with the
   particular call for proper correlation..


4.  Applicability Statement

   The Log-me mechanism is applicable to all the SIP entity in the
   network which includes UAS,UAC, Proxy,B2BUA etc.

   1) Each entity is free to simply ignore request , if it is not
   interested in log collection, or busy with other activities..

   2) Each entity can add its own "Log-Me" header and provide the path
   for the log collection..

   3) Each entity is free to log any information which is useful for
   troubleshooting.

   4) If an entity does not understand the header then it can simply
   ignore it.However, it should not remove the header, as removing stops
   the Possibility for logging at the next hop.

   5) If SIP signalling is secure then logging MUST be secure.

   6) If B2BUA gets a "Log-Me" header then it MUST NOT remove it.  It
   MAY modify or append "Log-Me" header.


5.  Log-me Header Field Definition and Syntax

            Log-Me = "Log-Me" HCOLON log-value *(COMMA log-value)
            log-value =  log-type  1*(SEMI log-params)
            log-type =  "mailto" / "http"/ "syslog" / "tftp" /
                       "ftp" /"sftp" / "local" / other-type
            log-params = log-maddr /log-uri/
                                     log-username/log-password/log-tag
            log-maddr= "maddr" EQUALS host
            log-uri = "uri" EQUALS userinfo
            userinfo = user "@" host
            log-username = "username"  EQUALS user
            user = 1*( unreserved   /   escaped   /   user-unreserved )
            log-password= "password" EQUALS*( unreserved   /
                   escaped   /    "="   /   "+"   /   "$"   /   "," )
            log-tag = tag EQUALS token
            other-type = token

             Example :
           Log-Me:mailto;uri=akaithal@cisco.com;tag=sdfrfgf43
           Log-Me:syslog;maddr=9.45.45.34;username=akaithal;
           password=addfere2;tag=sdfdsfe
           Log-Me:local;tag=sdfdsfe



   local means it should store the data locally.

   Support for the Log-me header field MAY be indicated by a UA by
   including the option-tag "log" in a Supported header field.

   Log-me header field value MUST consist of exactly one log-type.  If
   the log-type is mailto then it should have a log-uri (i.e. an email
   address).  For any other log-type log-username.log-password and log-
   maddr is MUST.  One entity can put more than one Log-me header in
   multiple line or separated by comma.  In case there are more than one
   Log-me header then it is the intermediate end point's decision to put
   the log in all places mentioned, or choose any one of them.  If log-
   uri and log-username are present then user portion of log-uri and
   log-username MUST be same.

   This is an optional header and can be built only in a SIP request and
   response.  The header can also be inserted by any intermediate entity
   in the network.

   If a SIP REFER message is sent to an endpoint and contains the
   "Log-Me" header, not only is the REFER method itself traced, but any
   call initiated via the REFER mechanism is also traced.  If "Log-Me"
   header is present in the request then entity should at least log SIP
   messages and any other relevant information which is required for
   debugging.


6.  UAC Behaviour

   If UAC supports this extension the it should add "log" tag in the
   supported header in the request or response.  In case UAC wants the
   call to be logged then it MUST add a Log-me header with the details
   to enable logging.

   UAC receives response with the "Log-Me" header then it starts
   collecting the data from that response on words till the end of the
   call.  It logs messages which is mandatory along with other logging
   information which is essential for troubleshooting from that device
   point of view.

7.  UAS Behaviour

   UAS receives request with the "Log-Me" header then it starts
   collecting the data from that request on words till the end of the
   call.  It logs messages which is mandatory along with other logging
   information which is essential for troubleshooting from that device
   point of view.

   If UAS supports this extension the it should add debug tag in the
   supported header in the request or response.  In case UAS wants the
   call to be logged then it MUST add a "Log-Me" header with the details
   in any of the responses to enable logging.


8.  Proxy Behaviour

   1) If proxy supports "log" extension and it gets "Log-Me" header in
   any of the request or response then it SHOULD process it and collect
   relevant logs.  Additionally it can do one of the following

   a) Forward the received "Log-Me" header as is.

   b) Add additional "Log-Me" header with details.

   c) Add its own "Log-Me" header and removing the received "Log-Me"
   header.

   The above action are applicable for the forked requests as well.

   2) If proxy does not support "log" extension and it receives "Log-Me"
   header then it MUST NOT remove it from the requests or responses.


9.  Security Considerations

   There are security consideration with this header as password is
   exposed.

   1) It is RECOMMENDED to have calls over TLS to send "Log-Me" header.

   2) It is RECOMMENDED for Intermediate devices to remove "Log-Me"
   header if the next hop is not TLS.  Alternatively it MAY modify
   "Log-Me" header local log type.


10.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideration for this draft.
