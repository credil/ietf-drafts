        Transaction SIGnature (TSIG) using CGA Algorithm in IPv6
                  draft-rafiee-intarea-cga-tsig-03.txt

Abstract

   The first step in the Transaction SIGnature (TSIG) (RFC 2845) process 
   is the generation of a shared secret to be used between a DNS server 
   and a host. The second step consists of modifying the DNS 
   configuration so that the DNS server will know what key to use with 
   which host, because this shared secret is only valid between a pair 
   of hosts. This document, CGA-TSIG, proposes a possible way to 
   eliminate the human intervention needed for the generation and 
   exchange of keys between a DNS server and a host when SEcure Neighbor 
   Discovery (SEND) (RFC 3971) is used. CGA-TSIG will facilitate the 
   authentication process of a host with a DNS server and will reduce 
   the time needed to accomplish DNS Updates. It will also provide a 
   means for securing the authentication process between resolvers and 
   clients. CGA-TSIG will be added, as an extension, to TSIG in order to 
   provide data integrity and proof of IP address ownership. The current 
   signature generation and verification process used in TSIG will be 
   substituted with the use of the same parameters as are used in 
   generating a secure address in IPv6 networks, i.e., Cryptographically 
   Generated Addresses (CGA) (RFC 3972).

INTERNET DRAFT             TSIG using CGA in IPv6           July 8, 2013



1.  Introduction 

   Transaction SIGnature (TSIG) [RFC2845] is a protocol that provides 
   endpoint authentication and data integrity by the use of one-way 
   hashing and shared secret keys in order to establish a trust 
   relationship between two hosts which can be either a client and a 
   server, or two servers. The TSIG keys, which are manually exchanged 
   between these two hosts, need to be maintained in a secure manner. 
   This protocol is today mostly used to secure a Dynamic Update, or to 
   give assurance to the slave name server, that the zone transfer is 
   from the original master name server and that it has not been spoofed 
   by hackers. It does this by verifying the signature using a 
   cryptographic key that is shared with the receiver. 

   It is possible to extend the TSIG protocol with the use of newly 
   defined algorithms. This document proposes to use Cryptographically 
   Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] as a new algorithm in the TSIG 
   Resource Record (RR). CGA is an important option available in SEcure 
   Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971] which provides nodes with the 
   necessary proof of IP address ownership by providing a cryptographic 
   binding between a host and its IP address without the need for the 
   introduction of a new infrastructure. CGA is a one-way hashing 
   algorithm used to generate Interface IDs for IPv6 addresses in a 
   secure manner. An interface ID consists of the rightmost 64 bits of 
   the 128 bit IPv6 address. CGA verifies the ownership of the sender's 
   IP address by finding a relationship between the sender's IP address 
   and his public key [1,2].

INTERNET DRAFT             TSIG using CGA in IPv6           July 8, 2013

   This document addresses the authentication problems associated with 
   the need for hosts to change their IP addresses frequently in order 
   to maintain privacy. This problem presents itself in three different 
   scenarios: the authentication of a resolver with a client (stub), the 
   authentication of two hosts (a client and a DNS server) during the 
   DNS Update process, and the authentication of two DNS servers during 
   the zone transfer. The focus of this document is on the first two 
   problems, but it can also offer a possible solution to the third 
   problem. 

   The DNS Update process is vulnerable to several types of spoofing 
   attacks -- man in the middle, reflector , source IP spoofing, etc. 
   TSIG secures this process by providing the transaction level 
   authentication necessary by use of a shared secret. The current 
   problem with using TSIG is the need for the manual processing that is 
   required to generate and exchange the shared secrets. For each paired 
   host there needs to be one shared secret and the administrator needs 
   to manually add it to the DNS configuration file for each of these 
   hosts. So, whenever these two hosts change their IP addresses, 
   because of privacy issues as explained in RFC 4941 [RFC4941] or when 
   moving to another subnet within the same network, this manual process 
   will need to be invoked. The purpose of CGA-TSIG [7] is to minimize 
   the amount of human intervention required to accomplish this exchange 
   and, as a byproduct, to reduce the process's vulnerability to attacks 
   introduced by human errors when SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) is 
   used for addressing purposes. 

   This same problem exists between a client and a DNS resolver. When a 
   client sends a DNS query to a resolver, an attacker can send a 
   response to this client containing the spoofed source IP address of 
   this resolver. The client checks the resolver's source IP address for 
   authentication. If the attacker spoofed the resolver's IP address, 
   and if the attacker responds faster than the legitimate resolver, 
   then the client's cache will be updated with the attacker's response. 
   The client does not have any way to authenticate the resolver. In the 
   above scenario, the resolver could add the TSIG Resource Record (RR) 
   to the DNS query response and use the CGA-TSIG algorithm in order to 
   permit a useful authentication of the result. CGA-TSIG assures the 
   client that the query response comes from the true originator and not 
   from an attacker. Currently there is little deployment of TSIG for 
   resolver authentication with clients. One reason is that resolvers 
   respond to anonymous queries and can be located in any part of the 
   network. A second reason is that the manual TSIG process makes it 
   difficult to configure each new client with the shared secret of the 
   resolver. 

   There are several types of attack that CGA-TSIG can prevent. Here we 
   will evaluate some of them. The use of CGA-TSIG will also reduce the 
   number of messages needed in exchange between a client and a server 
   in order to establish a secure channel. To exchange the shared secret 
   between a DNS resolver and a client, when TSIG is used, a minimum of 
   four messages are required for the establishment of a secure channel. 
   Modifying RFC 2845 to use CGA-TSIG will decrease the number of

   messages needed in the exchange. The messages used in RFC 2930 (TKEY 
   RR) are not needed when CGA-TSIG is used. 



3.1.  IP Spoofing  

   During the DNS Update process it is important that both communicating 
   parties know that the one that they are communicating with is the 
   actual owner of that IP address and that the messages are not being 
   sent from a spoofed IP address. This can be accomplished by the use 
   of the CGA algorithm which utilizes the node for IP address 
   verification of other nodes. 



3.2.  DNS Dynamic Update Spoofing 

   Dynamic Update Spoofing is eliminated because the signature contains 
   both the CGA parameters and the DNS update message. This will offer 
   proof of the sender's IP address ownership (CGA parameters) and the 
   validity of the update message. 



3.3.  Resolver Configuration Attack 

   When using CGA-TSIG, the DNS server, or the client, would not need 
   further configuration. This would reduce the possibility of human 
   errors being introduced into the DNS configuration file. Since this 
   type of attack is predicated on human error, the chances of it 
   occurring, when this extension is used, are minimized. 



3.4.  Exposing Shared Secret (key pairs)  

   In order to decrease the chances of attackers gaining unauthorized 
   access to private keys on a node, it is recommended that key pairs be 
   generated "on-the-fly". 



3.5.  Replay attack 

   Using the Time Signed value in the signature modifies the content of 
   the signature each time the node generates and sends it to the DNS 
   server. If the attacker tries to spoof this value with another 
   timestamp, to show that the update message is current, the DNS server 
   checks this message by verifying the signature. In this case, the 
   verification process will fail thus also preventing the replay 
   attack.

4.  Algorithm Overview 

   The following sections explain the use of CGA for securing the DNS 
   process by adding a CGA-TSIG data structure to the TSIG Resource 
   Record (RR). 



4.1.  The CGA-TSIG DATA structure  

   The CGA-TSIG data structure SHOULD be added to the Other DATA section 
   of the RDATA field in the TSIG Resource Record (RR) (see figures 2 
   and 3). The DNS RRTYPE must be set to TSIG [RFC2845]. The RDATA 
   Algorithm Name MUST be set to CGA-TSIG. A detailed explanation of the 
   standard RDATA fields can be found in section 2.3 RFC 2845. This 
   document focuses only on the new structure added to the Other DATA 
   section. These new fields are CGA-TSIG Len and CGA-TSIG DATA. The 
   TSIG RR is added to an additional section of the DNS message. If 
   another algorithm is used in place of CGA for SeND, such as SSAS [4 , 
   5], then the CGA-TSIG Len will be the length for the parameters of 
   this algorithm and CGA-TSIG DATA will consist of the parameters 
   required for verification of that algorithm, like signature, public 
   key, etc.

   Type indicates the Interface ID generation algorithm that was used in

   address. A client's public key can be associated with several IP 
   addresses on a server. The DNS server, or the DNS message verifier 
   node, SHOULD store the IP addresses and the public keys so as to 
   indicate their association to each other. If a client wants to add 
   RRs to the server by using a new IP address, then the IP tag field 
   will be set to binary zeros. The server will then store the new IP 
   address that was passed to it in storage. If the client wants to

   replace an existing IP address in a DNS server with a new one, then 
   the IP tag field will be populated with the IP address which is to be 
   replaced. The DNS server will then look for the IP address referenced 
   by the IP tag stored in its storage and replace that IP address with 
   the new one. This enables the client to update his own RRs using 
   multiple IP addresses while, at the same time, giving him the ability 
   to change IP addresses. If a node changes its public key in order to 
   maintain privacy, then it MUST add the old public key to the old 
   pubkey field. It MUST also retrieve the current time from Time Signed 
   field, sign it using the old private key, and then add the digest 
   (signature) to the old signature field. This enables the verifier 
   node to authenticate a host with a new public key. The detailed 
   verification steps are explained in sections 5.1, 6.1 and 7.1. 



4.2.  Generation of CGA-TSIG DATA 

   In order to use CGA-TSIG as an authentication approach, some of the 
   parameters need to be cached during IP address generation. If no 
   parameters are available in cache, please see section 8. If the Type 
   (section 4.1) is CGA, then the parameters that SHOULD be cached are 
   the modifier, algorithm type, location of the public/private keys and 
   the IP addresses of this host generated by the use of CGA. 

   1.Obtain required parameters from cache. 

   The CGA-TSIG algorithm obtains the old IP address, modifier, subnet 
   prefix, and public key from cache. It concatenates the old IP address 
   with the CGA parameters, i.e., modifier, subnet prefix, public key 
   and collision count (the order of CGA parameters are shown in section 
   3 RFC 3972). If the old IP address is not available, then CGA-TSIG 
   must set the old IP address (IP tag) to zero. 

   2. Generate signature 

   For signature generation, all CGA parameters (modifier, public key, 
   collision count and subnet prefix), that are concatenated with the 
   DNS update message, the IP tag and the Time Signed field, are signed 
   by using a RSA algorithm, the default, or any future algorithm used 
   in place of RSA, and the private key which was obtained from cache in 
   the first step. This signature must be added to the signature field 
   of the CGA-TSIG DATA. Time Signed is the same timestamp as is used in 
   RDATA. This value is the number of seconds since 1 January 1970 in 
   UTC obtained from the signature generator. This approach will prevent 
   replay attacks by changing the content of the signature each time a 
   node wants to send a DNS message. The format of DNS messages is 
   explained in section 4.1.2 RFC 1035 [RFC1035].

   3. Generate old signature 

   If the nodes generated new key pairs, then they need to add the old 
   public key and message, signed by the old private key, to CGA-TSIG 
   DATA. A node will retrieve the timestamp from Time Signed, will use 
   the old private key to sign it, and then will add the content of this 
   signature to the old signature field of CGA-TSIG DATA. This step MUST 
   be skipped when the node did not generate new key pairs. 



5.  DNS Update communication 

   This section discusses the use of CGA-TSIG for the authentication of 
   a host in a DNS server. In this case, the messages sent from a host 
   will need to contain the CGA-TSIG option.

5.1.  Verification process 

   Sender authentication is necessary in order to prevent attackers from 
   making unauthorized modifications to DNS servers through the use of 
   spoofed DNS messages. The verification process executes the following 
   steps: 

   1. Execute the CGA verification 

   These steps are found in section 5 RFC 3972. If the sender of the DNS 
   message uses another algorithm, instead of CGA, then this step 
   becomes the verification step for that algorithm. If the verification 
   process is successful, then step 2 will be executed. Otherwise the 
   message will be discarded without further action. 

   2. Check the Time Signed 

   The Time Signed value is obtained from TSIG RDATA and is called t1. 
   The current system time is then obtained and converted to UTC time 
   and is called t2. If t1 is in the range of t2 and t2 minus x minutes 
   (see formula 1, x minutes may vary according to transmission lag 
   time) then step 3 will be executed. Otherwise, the message will be 
   considered a spoofed message and the message should be discarded 
   without further action. The range is used in consideration of the 
   delays that can occur during its transmission over TCP or UDP. Both 
   times must use UTC time in order to avoid differences in time based 
   on different geographical locations. 

   t2-x <= t1 <= t2 (1) 

   3. Verify the signature 

   The signature contained in CGA-TSIG DATA should be verified. This can 
   be done by retrieving the public key and signature from CGA-TSIG DATA 
   and using this public key to verify the signature. If the 
   verification process is successful, then step 4 will be executed. If 
   the verification fails, then the message should be discarded without 
   further action. 

   4. Verify the public key 

   The DNS server checks whether or not the public key retrieved from 
   CGA-TSIG DATA is the same as what was available in the storage where 
   the public keys and IP addresses were saved. If no entry is found for 
   this public key in storage, then the DNS server adds this public key 
   to its storage and processes the Update Message. If it is available, 
   and it is the same as what is in storage, then the Update Message 
   should be processed. Otherwise step 5 will be executed. 

   5. Verify the old public key 

   If the old public key length is zero, then skip this step and discard 
   the DNS update message without further action. If the old public key

INTERNET DRAFT             TSIG using CGA in IPv6           July 8, 2013

   length is not zero, then the DNS server will retrieve the old public 
   key from CGA-TSIG DATA and will check to see whether or not it is the 
   same as what was saved in the DNS server's storage where the public 
   keys and IP addresses are stored. If it is the same, then step 6 will 
   be executed, otherwise the message should be discarded without 
   further action. 

   6. Verify the old signature 

   The old signature contained in CGA-TSIG DATA should be verified. This 
   can be done by retrieving the old public key and the old signature 
   from CGA-TSIG DATA and then using this old public key to verify the 
   old signature. If the verification is successful, then the Update 
   Message should be processed and the new public key should be replaced 
   with the old public key in the DNS server. If the verification 
   process fails, then the message should be discarded without further 
   action. 



6.  Stub to resolver communication 

   A DNS query request sent by a host, such as a client or a mail 
   server, does not need to include CGA-TSIG DATA because the resolver 
   responds to anonymous queries. But the resolver's response SHOULD 
   contain the CGA-TSIG DATA field in order to enable this client to 
   verify him. 

   In generation of the CGA-TSIG for a resolver, there is no need to 
   include the IP tag. This is because resolvers don't usually have 
   several IP addresses so the client does not need to keep several IP 
   addresses for the same resolver. 



6.1.  Verification process 

   When a resolver responds to the host's query request for the first 
   time, the client saves its public key in a file. This allows the 
   client to verify this resolver when it changes its IP address due to 
   privacy or security concerns. The first 2 steps of the verification 
   process are the same as those steps explained in section 5.1 These 
   steps are as follows: 

   1. Execute the CGA verification 

   2. Check the Time Signed 

   3. Verify the Source IP address 

   If the resolver's source IP address is the same as that which is 
   known for the host, then step 4 will be executed. Otherwise the 
   message SHOULD be discarded without further action.

   4. Verify the signature 

   The signature contained in CGA-TSIG DATA should be verified. This can 
   be done by retrieving the public key and signature from CGA-TSIG DATA 
   and using this public key to verify the signature. If the 
   verification process is successful, then step 5 will be executed. If 
   the verification fails, then the message should be discarded without 
   further action. 

   5. Verify the public key 

   The host checks whether or not the public key retrieved from CGA-TSIG 
   DATA matches any public key that was previously saved in the storage 
   where the public keys and IP addresses of resolvers are saved. If 
   there is a match, then the message is processed. If not, then step 5 
   will be executed. 

   5. Verify the old public key 

   If the old public key length is zero, then skip this step and discard 
   the DNS query response without further action. If the old public key 
   length is not zero, then the host will retrieve the old public key 
   from CGA-TSIG DATA and will check whether or not it is the same as 
   what was saved in the host's storage where the public keys and IP 
   addresses are stored. If it is the same, then step 6 will be 
   executed, otherwise the message should be discarded without further 
   action. 

   6. Verify the old signature 

   The old signature contained in CGA-TSIG DATA should be verified. This 
   can be done by retrieving the old public key and old signature from 
   CGA-TSIG DATA and then using this old public key to verify the old 
   signature. If the verification is successful, then the DNS Message 
   should be processed and the new public key should be replaced with 
   the old public key of the resolver in the host. If the verification 
   process fails, then the message should be discarded without further 
   action. 



7.  DNS server to DNS server communication (zone transfer) 

   In the case of processing a DNS update for multiple DNS servers 
   (authentication of two DNS servers), there are two possible scenarios 
   with regard to the authentication process, which differs from that of 
   the authentication of a node (client) with one DNS server. This is 
   because of the need for human intervention. 

   a. Add the DNS servers' IP address to a slave configuration file 

   A DNS server administrator should only manually add the IP address of 


Rafiee, et al.      Expires January 8, 2014                    [Page 12]

INTERNET DRAFT             TSIG using CGA in IPv6           July 8, 2013

   the master DNS server to the configuration file of the slave DNS 
   server. When the DNS update message is processed, the slave DNS 
   server can authenticate the master DNS server based on the source IP 
   address and then, prove the ownership of this address by use of the 
   CGA-TSIG option from the TSIG RR. This scenario will be valid until 
   the IP address in any of these DNS servers changes. 

   To automate this step's process, the DNS Update message sender's 
   public key must be saved on the other DNS server, after the source IP 
   address has been successfully verified for the first time. In this 
   case, when the sender generates a new IP address by executing the CGA 
   algorithm using the same public key, the other DNS server can still 
   verify it and add its new IP address to the DNS configuration file 
   automatically. 

   b. Retrieve public/private keys from a third party Trusted Authority 
   (TA) 

   The message exchange option of SEND [RFC3971] may be used for the 
   retrieval of the third party certificate. This may be done 
   automatically from the TA by using the Certificate Path Solicitation 
   and the Certificate Path Advertisement messages. Like in scenario b, 
   the certificate should be saved on the DNS server for later use for 
   the generation of its address or for the DNS update process. In this 
   case, whenever any of these servers want to generate a new IP 
   address, then the DNS update process can be accomplished 
   automatically without the need for human intervention. 



7.1.  Verification Process 

   The verification steps are the same as those is explained in section 
   5.1, but with one additional step. 

   1- Execute the CGA verification 

   2- Check the Time Signed 

   3- Verify the signature 

   4- Verify the source IP address 

   The source IP address of the Update requester MUST be checked against 
   the one contained in the DNS configuration file. If it is the same, 
   then the Update Message should be processed, otherwise, step 5 will 
   be executed. 

   5- Verify the public key 

   6- Verify the old public key 

   7- Verify the old signature

8.  No cache parameters available 

   In a case where there are no cache parameters available during the IP 
   address generation, the sender of DNS message needs to generate a key 
   pair and generate the CGA-TSIG data structure as explained in section 
   4. The node SHOULD skip the first section of verification processes 
   explained in section 5.1 , section 6.1 and section 7.1. 













9.  Security Considerations

   The approach explained in this draft, CGA-TSIG, is a solution for 
   securing DNS messages from spoofing type attacks like those explained 
   in section 3. 

   A problem that may arise here concerns attacks against the CGA 
   algorithm. In this section we will explain the possibility of such 
   attacks against CGA [5] and explain the available solutions that we 
   considered in this draft. 

   a) Discover an Alternative Key Pair Hashing of the Victim's Node 
   Address 

   In this case an attacker would have to find an alternate key pair 
   hashing of the victim's address. The probability for success of this 
   type of attack will rely on the security properties of the underlying 
   hash function, i.e., an attacker will need to break the second 
   pre-image resistance of that hash function. The attacker will perform 
   a second pre-image attack on a specific address in order to match 
   other CGA parameters using Hash1 and Hash2. The cost of doing this is 
   (2^59+1) * 2^(16*1). If the user uses a sufficient security level, it 
   will be not feasible for an attacker to carry out this type of attack 
   due to the cost involved. Changing the IP address frequently will 
   also decrease the chance for this type of attack succeeding. 

   b) DoS to Kill a CGA Node 

   Sending a valid or invalid CGA signed message with high frequency 
   across the network can keep the destination node(s) busy with the 


Rafiee, et al.      Expires January 8, 2014                    [Page 14]

INTERNET DRAFT             TSIG using CGA in IPv6           July 8, 2013

   verification process. This type of DoS attack is not specific to CGA, 
   but it can be applied to any request-response protocol. One possible 
   solution ,to mitigate this attack, is to add a controller to the 
   verifier side of the process to determine how many messages a node 
   has received over a certain period of time from a specific node. If a 
   determined threshold rate is exceeded, then the node will stop 
   further receipt of incoming messages from that node. 

   c) CGA Privacy Implication 

   Due to the high computational complexity necessary for the creation 
   of a CGA, it is likely that once a node generates an acceptable CGA 
   it will continue its use at that subnet. The result is that nodes 
   using CGAs are still susceptible to privacy related attacks. One 
   solution to these types of attacks is setting a lifetime for the 
   address as explained in RFC 4941. 



10.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has allowed for choosing new algorithm(s) for use in the 
   TSIG Algorithm name. Algorithm name refers to the algorithm described 
   in this document. The requirement to have this name registered with 
   IANA is specified. 

   In section 4.1, Type should allow for the use of future optional 
   algorithms with regard to SeND. The default value for CGA might be 1. 
   Other algorithms would be assigned a new number sequentially. For 
   example, a new algorithm called SSAS [4,5] could be assigned a value 
   of 2.

   For example, the modifier is stored as bytes and each byte might be 
   separated by a comma (for example : 284,25,14,...). Algorithmtype is 
   the algorithm used in signing the message. Zero is the default 
   algorithm for RSA. Secval is the CGA Sec value that is, by default, 
   one. GIP is the global IP address of this node (for example: 
   2001:abc:def:1234:567:89a). oGIP is the old IP address of this node, 
   before the generation of the new IP address. Keys contains the path 
   where the CGA-TSIG algorithm can find the PEM format used for the 
   public/private keys (for example: /home/myuser/keys.pem ).
