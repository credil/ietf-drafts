                  Multi-access Indicator for Mobility
            draft-koodli-netext-multiaccess-indicator-02.txt

Abstract

   When a Mobile Node attaches to the mobile network using multiple
   access networks, it is important for the Mobile Network Gateway to
   know whether the Mobile Node is capable of simultaneous multi-access,
   so that the former can distribute the traffic flows using the most
   appropriate interface.  This document defines a new EAP attribute
   which can be used for such an indication to the Mobile Network
   Gateway.  The document also reserves a new MIP6-Feature-Vector flag.

Internet-Draft     Multi-access Indicator for Mobility       August 2011


1.  Introduction

   With multi-access, a Mobile Node (MN) may be simultaneously attached
   to a mobile network via multiple access technologies or just be
   multi-homed.  For instance, in the 3GPP architecture [3gpp-4g-2], a
   MN may be attached to the same Mobile Network Gateway (MNG), called
   the PGW, via 4G cellular LTE technology as well as the Wireless LAN
   (WiFi) technology.  Such simultaneous access provides opportunity to
   distribute traffic based on the most appropriate access for the type
   of traffic in question as well as policy triggers such as the Time Of
   the Day. In order to accomplish this flow distribution or flow
   mobility, the MNG needs to know that the MN's attachment is for
   multi-access (and not handover) purposes and that the MN has the
   necessary host abstractions to support prefix sharing across access
   interfaces.  This document defines an attribute to be used during the
   EAP-AKA authentication process so that the 3GPP AAA server
   understands the MN's capabilities.  Subsequently, the 3GPP AAA server
   provides the MN's capabilities in a Diameter message, enabling the
   MNG to make the policy decisions to perform flow mobility.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Protocol Overview

   In the 3GPP architecture [3gpp-4g-2], two types of "non-3GPP"
   accesses are supported.  In the trusted access model, the access
   network is considered trustworthy by the 3GPP network operator.  An
   example of a trusted network is another cellular network such as CDMA
   or WiMAX, but may also include broadband wireline network with WiFi
   access such as a residential access network operated by the 3GPP
   cellular service provider.  In the untrusted access model, the 3GPP
   service provider does not possess a trust relationship with the non-
   3GPP access provider.  An example includes WiFi hot spot access.

   In the trusted access model, the MN communicates with an Access
   Network Gateway (ANG).  In the untrusted access model, the MN
   communicates with a secure tunnel (e.g., IPsec) termination node
   called ePDG.  In both the trusted and untrusted access models, the MN
   performs EAP-AKA [RFC4187] or EAP-AKA' [RFC5448] authentication.  In
   the trusted access model, the EAP-AKA messages are transported from
   the MN to the ANG over a protocol specific to the access network.  In
   the untrusted access model, the EAP-AKA messages are transported from

   the MN to the ePDG over IKEv2 [RFC5996].  Both the ANG and the ePDG
   communicate with the (3GPP) AAA server using Diameter.  This is shown
   in Figure 1, which we explain further below.  The security
   architecture itself is described in [3gpp-33.402].

                 Figure 1: Authentication and Registration

   1.  The MN attaches to the non-3GPP access network

       The MN performs EAP-AKA or EAP-AKA' authentication.  The EAP
       messages are sent over IKEv2 when the MN is connected using
       untrusted access.

       As a part of the EAP-AKA procedure, the MN responds with EAP-
       Response/AKA-Challenge message.  In this message, the MN includes
       a new attribute AT_MA_IND which indicates that the MN's
       attachment is for multi-access purposes, and that the MN supports
       the necessary abstraction (Logical Interface) for flow mobility.

       The ANG/ePDG forwards the EAP message to the AAA server using the
       Diameter EAP application protocol message Diameter EAP Request
       (DER) message specified in [RFC4072].

   2.  The 3GPP AAA server verifies through subscription records at the
       Home Subscriber Server (HSS) that the the MN is allowed to use
       flow mobility.  Subsequently, the AAA server provides the result
       in a new EAP attribute AT_MA_STATUS in the existing EAP-Request/
       AKA-Notification message (which is used for indicating the IP
       Mobility Selection mode [3gpp-24.302]).  The EAP message is sent
       using the Diameter EAP Answer (DEA) message to the ANG/ePDG,
       which forwards the EAP message to the MN.

   3.  The ANG/ePDG sends the PMIP6 PBU message.

   4.  The MNG contacts the AAA server to update the MNG's address for
       the MN's connection.  The MNG includes the MIP6-Feature-Vector
       AVP with the MN_MULTIACCESS flag set in the AAA request to
       indicate that multi-access is allowed and supported by the MNG.

   5.  The AAA server provides the MN's multi-access indication and
       Logical Interface capability in a MN_MULTIACCESS lag in the MIP6-
       Feature-Vector AVP [RFC5447].

   6.  The MNG now understands that the MN is capable of flow mobility.
       It provides a prefix in the PBA accordingly.  For instance, it
       may provide a new prefix as well as one or more of the already-
       assigned prefixes in the PBA.

       The ANG/ePDG MUST be able to provide forwarding support for the
       prefixes provided in the PBA, regardless of the type of
       attachment indicated in the PBU message.

   If the AAA server determines that the UE is not permitted for multi-
   access flow mobility through the MNG, it does not include the
   MN_MULTIACCESS flag in the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP.  The absence of
   the flag is an indication to the MNG that flow mobility is disabled
   in the subscription.  If the AAA server does not understand the
   AT_MN_IND attribute, it silently discards the attribute, and hence
   does not send the AT_MA_STATUS attribute back in the EAP-Request/
   AKA-Notification message.  It also does not provide the MIP6-Feature-
   Vector to the MNG.


4.  Protocol Extensions

   Two extensions to existing protocols are defined in this
   specification.  First, a new RFC 5447 MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP
   capability flag is defined.  Second, two new EAP attributes AT_MA_IND
   and AT_MA_STATUS are defined.

4.1.  MN_MULTIACCESS Capability Flag

   The MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP [RFC5447] capability flag MN_MULTIACCESS
   (TBD by IANA) is used by the requesting Diameter node to indicate
   that it supports multi-access functionality and the feature is also
   allowed by its policy.  The Diameter server uses the flag to
   authorize the use of multi-access functionality.

   The absence of the MN_MULTIACCESS feature flags indicates that either
   the multi-access feature is not supported/understood or prohibited by

   a local policy.

4.2.  AT_MA_IND EAP Attribute

   The skippable AT_MA_IND EAP attribute is included in EAP-Response/
   AKA-Challenge message and indicates to the EAP authenticator that the
   EAP peer (i.e., the mobile node) supports multi-access functionality
   and this attachment is for multi-access purposes.  The attribute is
   illustrated in Figure 2.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                     Figure 2: AT_MA_IND EAP Attribute

4.3.  AT_MA_STATUS EAP Attribute

   The non-skippable AT_MA_STATUS EAP attribute is included in EAP-
   Request/AKA-Notification or EAP-Request/EAP-Success messages.  Due to
   alignment with [3gpp-24.302] EAP usage this specification only gives
   examples of cases where EAP-Request/AKA-Notification is used.  The
   attribute indicates to the EAP peer (i.e., the mobile node) that the
   EAP authenticator supports multi-access functionality and provides
   the result of the multi-access functionality negotiation.  The
   attribute is illustrated in Figure 3.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   |AT_MA_STATUS   | Length = 1    | Result Code   |   Reserved    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                   Figure 3: AT_MA_STATUS EAP Attribute

   Following Result Codes are defined by this specification:

   0  The multi-access functionality was accepted.

   128  The multi-access functionality was rejected by a local policy.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new flag (TBD by IANA) for the MIP6-Feature-
   Vector AVP in RFC 5447, which needs IANA assignment.  This document

   defines two new EAP attributes: the skippable AT_MA_IND (TBD by IANA)
   and the non-skippable AT_MA_STATUS (TBD by IANA).  Both attributes
   need IANA assignment.

   IANA is also requested to establish a new registry for the
   AT_MA_STATUS Result Codes.  Values between 0-127 are for success
   codes and values between 128-255 are for error code.  The initial
   values for this registry are listed in Section 4.3.  New values for
   the registry MUST follow the Specification Required [RFC5226].


6.  Security Considerations

   This documents defines a new EAP attribute to extend the capability
   of EAP-AKA protocol as specified in Section 8.2 of RFC 4187
   [RFC4187].  This attribute is passed from the MN to the AAA server.
   The document does not specify any new messages or options to the EAP-
   AKA protocol.
