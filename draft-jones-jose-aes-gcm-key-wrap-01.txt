Internet-Draft      Key Wrapping with AES GCM for JWE          July 2013


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines how to encrypt (wrap) keys with the AES
   GCM algorithm [AES] [NIST.800-38D] for JSON Web Encryption (JWE)
   [JWE] objects.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the same terminology as the JSON Web
   Encryption (JWE) [JWE] and JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA]
   specifications.


3.  Key Encryption with AES GCM

   This section defines the specifics of encrypting a JWE Content
   Encryption Key (CEK) with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in
   Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) [AES] [NIST.800-38D] using 128 or 256 bit
   keys.  The "alg" header parameter values "A128GCMKW" or "A256GCMKW"
   are respectively used in this case.

   Use of an Initialization Vector of size 96 bits is REQUIRED with this
   algorithm.  The Initialization Vector is represented in base64url
   encoded form as the "iv" (initialization vector) header parameter
   value.

   The Additional Authenticated Data value used is the empty octet
   string.

   The requested size of the Authentication Tag output MUST be 128 bits,
   regardless of the key size.

   The JWE Encrypted Key value is the Ciphertext output.

   The Authentication Tag output is represented in base64url encoded
   form as the "tag" (authentication tag) header parameter value.

3.1.  Header Parameters Used for AES GCM Key Encryption

   The following Header Parameter Names are used for AES GCM key
   encryption.  They MAY also be used by other algorithms if so
   specified by those algorithm parameter definitions.

3.1.1.  "iv" (Initialization Vector) Header Parameter

   The "iv" (initialization vector) header parameter value is the
   base64url encoded representation of the Initialization Vector value
   used for the key encryption operation.  This Header Parameter is
   REQUIRED and MUST be understood and processed by implementations when
   these algorithms are used.

3.1.2.  "tag" (Authentication Tag) Header Parameter

   The "tag" (authentication tag) header parameter value is the
   base64url encoded representation of the Authentication Tag value
   resulting from the key encryption operation.  This Header Parameter
   is REQUIRED and MUST be understood and processed by implementations
   when these algorithms are used.


4.  IANA Considerations
