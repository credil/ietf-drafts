1.  Introduction

   An enrollment server as defined by section 11.3 of [RELOAD] generates
   certificates that are used by a RELOAD implementation as client and
   server certificates for the purpose of establishing (D)TLS links and
   signing RELOAD messages and data.  The enrollment server also manages
   the CA certificate used as Issuer for these certificates, but this CA
   cannot be used to sign any other kind of certificate, like an HTTPS
   certificate that could be used to manage the OAM API of the
   enrollment server, because there is no possibility to restrict a
   certificate to be used only in a RELOAD overlay.

   This document solves this problem by describing an Extended Key Usage
   (EKU) X.509 certificate extension for restricting the usage of a
   certificate to a REsource LOcation And Discovery [RELOAD] overlay.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "NOT RECOMMENDED" are
   appropriate when valid exceptions to a general requirement are known
   to exist or appear to exist, and it is infeasible or impractical to
   enumerate all of them.  However, they should not be interpreted as
   permitting implementors to fail to implement the general requirement
   when such failure would result in interoperability failure.

3.  Extended Key Usage

   This document defines the KeyPurposeId [RFC5280] id-kp-reload.  The
   presence of this KeyPurposeId in a certificate indicates that the
   usage of this certificate is restricted for use in a RELOAD overlay.

   id-kp-reload OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBD }


4.  Support in implementations

   To be compatible with RELOAD implementations that predates this
   extension, only the RELOAD overlays running with a configuration file
   that contains a mandatory-extension element containing the namespace
   registered by IANA MUST enforce this restriction.

5.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
   [RUNNING-CODE].  According to [RUNNING-CODE], "this will allow
   reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents
   that have the benefit of running code, by considering the running
   code as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that has
   made the implemented protocols more mature.  It is up to the
   individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".

5.1.  reloadd

   Name:   reloadd 0.6.1

   Description:   An implementation of the configuration and enrollment
      servers as specified in [RELOAD].  The certificates generated
      contains the extension described in this document.

   Level of maturity:   Experimental.

   Coverage:   Fully implements this specification.  The RESTful API
      used to manage the configuration and enrollment servers uses a
      client certificate signed with the same CA that is used to sign
      the RELOAD certificate, but without the EKU described in this
      document.

   Licensing:   Proprietary.  Free accounts available for
      interoperability testing.

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD

7.  IANA Considerations

   If this document is accepted as a standard track document the EKU
   used in this document will be registered in an arc delegated by IANA
   to the PKIX Working Group.

   Until an official OID is assigned, the following OID allocated in the
   PEN of the author can be used for experimental purpose:

   1.3.6.1.4.1.40544.5.5.7.3.30


   If this document is accepted as a standard track document this
   section will request an URN in the "XML Namespaces" class of the
   "IETF XML Registry" from IANA.  Until this is done, implementations
   should use the following URN:
