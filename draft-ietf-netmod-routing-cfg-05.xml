    <t>This document contains a specification of three YANG modules.
    Together they form the core routing data model which serves as a
    framework for configuring a routing subsystem. It is therefore
    expected that these modules will be augmented by additional YANG
    modules defining data models for individual routing protocols and
    other related functions. The core routing data model provides
    common building blocks for such configurations - router instances,
    routes, routing tables, routing protocols and route filters.</t>

  <section anchor="sec.introduction" title="Introduction">

    <t>This document contains a specification of the following YANG
    modules:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>Module "ietf-routing" provides generic components of a
      routing data model.</t>
      <t>Module "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" augments the

      <t>Module "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" augments the

      unicast, including the router configuration variables required
      by <xref target="RFC4861"/>.</t>
    </list></t>

    <t>These modules together define the so-called core routing data
    model, which is proposed as a basis for the development of data
    models for more sophisticated routing configurations. While these
    three modules can be directly used for simple IP devices with
    static routing, their main purpose is to provide essential
    building blocks for more complicated setups involving multiple
    routing protocols, multicast routing, additional address families,
    and advanced functions such as route filtering or policy
    routing. To this end, it is expected that the core routing data
    model will be augmented by numerous modules developed by other
    IETF working groups.</t>

    <t>The initial design of the core routing data model was driven by
    the following objectives:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>The data model should be suitable for the common address
      families, in particular IPv4 and IPv6, and for unicast and
      multicast routing, as well as Multiprotocol Label Switching
      (MPLS).</t>
      <t>Simple routing setups, such as static routing, should be
      configurable in a simple way, ideally without any need to develop
      additional YANG modules.</t>
      <t>On the other hand, the core routing framework must
      allow for complicated setups involving multiple routing tables
      and multiple routing protocols, as well as controlled
      redistributions of routing information.</t>
      <t>Device vendors will want to map the data models built on this
      generic framework to their proprietary data models and
      configuration interfaces. Therefore, the framework should be
      flexible enough to facilitate such a mapping and accommodate
      data models with different logic.</t>

  <section anchor="sec.design" title="The Design of the Core Routing Data Model">

    <t>The core routing data model consists of three YANG modules. The
    first module, "ietf-routing", defines the generic components of a
    routing system. The other two modules, "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing"
    and "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing", augment the "ietf-routing" module
    with additional data nodes that are needed for IPv4 and IPv6
    unicast routing, respectively. The combined data hierarchy is
    shown in <xref target="fig.yangdata"/>, where brackets enclose
    list keys, "rw" means configuration, "ro" operational state data,
    and "?" means optional node. Parentheses enclose choice and case
    nodes, and case nodes are also marked with a colon (":").</t>

    <t>As can be seen from <xref target="fig.yangdata"/>, the core
    routing data model introduces several generic components of a
    routing framework: routers, routing tables containing routes,
    routing protocols and route filters. The following subsections
    describe these components in more detail.</t>
    <t>By combining the components in various ways, and possibly
    augmenting them with appropriate contents defined in other
    modules, various routing setups can be realized.</t>

    <t>The example in <xref target="fig.exsetup"/> shows a typical
    (though certainly not the only possible) organization of a more
    complex routing subsystem for a single address family. Several of
    its features are worth mentioning:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>Along with the main routing table, which must always be
      present, an additional routing table is configured.</t>
      <t>Each routing protocol instance, including the "static" and
      "direct" pseudo-protocols, is connected to one routing
      table with which it can exchange routes (in both directions,
      except for the "static" and "direct" pseudo-protocols).</t>
      <t>Routing tables may also be connected to each other and
      exchange routes in either direction (or both).</t>
      <t>Route exchanges along all connections may be controlled by
      means of route filters, denoted by "F" in <xref target="fig.exsetup"/>.</t>
    </list></t>

    <section anchor="sec.router" title="Router">

      <t>Each router instance in the core routing data model
      represents a logical router. The exact semantics of this term is left
      to implementations. For example, router instances may be
      completely isolated virtual routers or, alternatively, they may
      internally share certain information.</t>
      <t>An implementation MAY support multiple types of logical
      routers simultaneously. Instances of all router types are
      organized as entries of the same flat "router" list. In order to
      distinguish router instances belonging to the same type, the
      "type" leaf is defined as a child of the "router" node.</t>
      <t>An implementation MAY pose restrictions on allowed router
      types and on the number of supported instances for each
      type. For example, a simple router implementation may support
      only one router instance of the default type "standard-router".</t>
      <t>Each network layer interface has to be assigned to one or
      more router instances in order to be able to participate in
      packet forwarding, routing protocols and other operations of
      those router instances. The assignment is accomplished by
      creating a corresponding entry in the list of router interfaces
      ("rt:interface"). The key of the list entry MUST be the name of
      a configured network layer interface, i.e., the value of a node
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/if:name defined in the
      "ietf-interfaces" module&#xA0;<xref target="YANG-IF"/>.</t>
      <t>In YANG terms, the list of router interfaces is modeled as
      the "list" node rather than "leaf-list" in order to allow for
      adding, via augmentation, other configuration or operational
      state data related to the corresponding router interface.</t>
      <t>Implementations MAY specify additional rules for the
      assignment of interfaces to logical routers. For example, it may
      be required that the sets of interfaces assigned to different
      logical routers be disjoint.</t>

      <section anchor="sec.4861" title="Configuration of IPv6 Router Interfaces">

        <t>The module "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" augments the

          the same in consecutive advertisements, or decrement in real
          time. However, the latter behavior seems problematic because
          the values might be reset again to the (higher) configured
          values after a configuration is reloaded. Moreover, no
          implementation is known to use the decrementing
          behavior. The "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" module therefore

    <section anchor="sec.routes" title="Routes">
      <t>Routes are basic units of information in a routing
      system. The core routing data model defines only the following
      minimal set of route attributes:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>"destination-prefix": IP prefix specifying the set of
        destination addresses for which the route may be used. This

      <t>The above list of route attributes suffices for a simple

      data, for example as manually configured static routes, and in
      operational state data, for example as entries in routing
      tables.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec.rtables" title="Routing Tables">
      <t>Routing tables are lists of routes complemented with
      administrative data, namely:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>"source-protocol": name of the routing protocol from which
        the route was originally obtained.</t>
        <t>"last-updated": the date and time when the route was last
	updated, or inserted into the routing table.</t>
      </list>
      Each routing table may contain only routes of the same address
      family. Address family information consists of two parameters -
      "address-family" and "safi" (Subsequent Address Family
      Identifier, SAFI). The permitted values for these two parameters
      are defined by IANA and represented using YANG enumeration types
      "ianaaf:address-family" and "ianaaf:subsequent-address-family"
      <xref target="IANA-IF-AF"/>.</t>
      <t>In the core routing data model, the "routing-table" node
      represents configuration while the descendant list of routes is
      defined as operational state data. The contents of route lists
      are controlled and manipulated by routing protocol operations
      which may result in route additions, removals and
      modifications. This also includes manipulations via the "static"
      and/or "direct" pseudo-protocols, see <xref target="sec.pseudoproto"/>.</t>
      <t>One or more routing tables MUST be configured for each
      address family supported by the server. Each router instance
      MUST designate, for every address family that the router
      instance supports, exactly one routing table as its main routing
      table. This is accomplished by creating an entry in the
      "main-routing-table" list, which contains a reference to the
      routing table that is selected as main.</t>
      <t>Main routing tables serve the following purposes:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>The router instance always installs direct routes for an
        address family to that address family's main routing
        table. </t>
        <t>By default, a routing protocol SHOULD be connected to the
        main routing table of each address family supported by that
        routing protocol. See <xref target="sec.proto"/> for further
        explanation.</t>
      </list></t>
      <t>Routing tables are global, which means that a configured
      routing table may be used by any or all router instances.</t>
      <t>Server implementations MAY pose restrictions regarding the
      number of supported routing tables, and rules for configuration
      and use of routing tables. For example:
      <list style="symbols">
	<t>A server may support no more than one routing table per
	address family.</t>
	<t>Router instances (of a certain type) may not be allowed to
	share routing tables, i.e., each routing table is used by no
	more than one router instance.</t>
      </list>
      For servers supporting multiple routing tables per address
      family, additional tables can be configured by creating new
      entries in the "routing-table" list, either as a part of
      factory-default configuration, or by a client's action.</t>
      <t>The way how the routing system uses information from routing
      tables for actual packet forwarding is outside the scope of this
      document.</t>
      <t>Every routing table can serve as a source of routes for other
      routing tables. To achieve this, one or more recipient routing
      tables may be specified in the configuration of the source
      routing table. Optionally, a route filter may be configured for
      any or all recipient routing tables. Such a route filter then
      selects and/or manipulates the routes that are passed on between
      the source and recipient routing table.</t>
      <t>A routing table MUST NOT appear among its own recipient
      routing tables. A recipient routing table also MUST be of the
      same address family as its source routing table.Consequently,
      configuration of recipient routing tables makes sense only for
      servers supporting multiple routing tables per address
      family. Servers supporting only one routing table per address
      family MAY therefore decide to remove the container
      "recipient-routing-tables", together with its contents, from the
      data model.</t>
      <t/>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec.proto" title="Routing Protocols">

      <t>The core routing data model provides an open-ended framework
      for defining multiple routing protocol instances within each
      router instance. Each routing protocol instance MUST be assigned
      a type, which is an identity derived from the
      "rt:routing-protocol" base identity. The core routing data model
      defines two identities for the direct and static
      pseudo-protocols (<xref target="sec.pseudoproto"/>).</t>
      <t>Each routing protocol instance is connected to exactly one
      routing table for each address family that the routing protocol
      instance supports. By default, every routing protocol instance
      SHOULD be connected to the main routing table or tables. An
      implementation MAY allow any or all routing protocol instances
      to be configured to use a different routing table.</t>
      <t>Routes learned from the network by a routing protocol are
      passed to the connected routing table(s) and vice versa, subject
      to routing protocol specific rules and restrictions.</t>
      <t>In addition, two independent route filters (see <xref target="sec.filters"/>) may be defined for a routing protocol
      instance to control the exchange of routes in both directions
      between the routing protocol instance and the connected routing
      table:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>import filter controls which routes are passed from a
        routing protocol instance to the connected routing table,</t>
        <t>export filter controls which routes the routing protocol
        instance may receive from the connected routing table.</t>
      </list></t>
      <t>Note that, for historical reasons, the terms import and
      export are used from the viewpoint of a routing table.</t>

      <section anchor="sec.pseudoproto" title="Routing Pseudo-Protocols">

      <t>The core routing data model defines two special routing
      protocol types - "direct" and "static". Both are in fact
      pseudo-protocols, which means that they are confined to the
      local device and do not exchange any routing information with
      neighboring routers. Routes from both "direct" and "static"
      protocol instances are passed to the connected routing table
      (subject to route filters, if any), but an exchange in the
      opposite direction is not allowed.</t>
      <t>Every router instance MUST implement exactly one instance of
      the "direct" pseudo-protocol type. The name of this instance
      MUST also be "direct". It is the source of direct routes for all
      configured address families. Direct routes are normally supplied
      by the operating system kernel, based on the configuration of
      network interface addresses, see <xref target="sec.ietf-ip"/>. The "direct" pseudoprotocol MUST always
      be connected to the main routing tables of all supported address
      families. This means that direct routes are always installed in
      the main routing tables. However, direct routes MAY be filtered
      before they appear in the main routing table.</t>
      <t>A pseudo-protocol of the type "static" allows for specifying
      routes manually. It MAY be configured in zero or multiple
      instances, although a typical configuration will have exactly
      one instance per logical router.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec.newproto" title="Defining New Routing Protocols">
        <t>It is expected that future YANG modules will create data
        models for additional routing protocol types. Such a new
        module has to define the protocol-specific configuration and
        operational state data, and it has to fit it into the core
        routing framework in the following way:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>A new identity MUST be defined for the routing protocol
          and its base identity MUST be set to "rt:routing-protocol",
          or to an identity derived from "rt:routing-protocol".</t>
          <t>Additional route attributes MAY be defined, preferably in
          one place by means of defining a YANG grouping. The new
          attributes have to be inserted as operational state data by
          augmenting the definition of the node
	          <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[       /rt:routing-tables/rt:routing-table/rt:route,
	  ]]></artwork>
		  </figure>
	  and possibly to other places in the configuration,
	  operational state data and RPC input or output.</t>
          <t>Per-interface configuration parameters can be added by
          augmenting the data node "rt:interface" (the list of router
          interfaces).</t>
          <t>Other configuration parameters and operational state data
          can be defined by augmenting the "routing-protocol" data
          node.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>By using the "when" statement, the augmented per-interface
        and other configuration parameters specific to the new
        protocol SHOULD be made conditional and valid only if the
        value of "rt:type" is equal to the new protocol's identity. It
        is also RECOMMENDED that the protocol-specific data be
        encapsulated in appropriately named containers.</t>
        <t>The above steps are implemented by the example YANG module
        for the RIP routing protocol in <xref target="app.rip"/>. First, the module defines a new
        identity for the RIP protocol:</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
identity rip {
  base rt:routing-protocol;
  description "Identity for the RIP routing protocol.";
}]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>New route attributes specific to the RIP protocol ("metric"
        and "tag") are defined in a grouping and then added to the
        route definitions appearing in "routing-table" and in the
        output part of the "active-route" RPC method:</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
grouping route-content {
  description
    "RIP-specific route content.";
  leaf metric {
    type rip-metric;
  }
  leaf tag {
    type uint16;
    default "0";
    description
      "This leaf may be used to carry additional info, e.g. AS
       number.";
  }
}

augment "/rt:routing/rt:routing-tables/rt:routing-table/"
      + "rt:routes/rt:route" {
  description
    "RIP-specific route components.";
  uses route-content;
}

augment "/rt:active-route/rt:output/rt:route" {
  description
    "Add RIP-specific route content.";
  uses route-content;
}]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Per-interface configuration data are defined by the
        following "augment" statement:</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
augment "/rt:routing/rt:router/rt:interfaces/rt:interface" {
  when "../../rt:routing-protocols/rt:routing-protocol/rt:type  = "
     + "'rip:rip'";
  container rip {
    description
      "Per-interface RIP configuration.";
    leaf enabled {
      type boolean;
      default "true";
    }
    leaf metric {
      type rip-metric;
      default "1";
    }
  }
}]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Finally, global RIP configuration data are integrated into
        the "rt:routing-protocol" node by using the following
        "augment" statement, which is again valid only for routing
        protocol instances whose type is "rip:rip":</t>

        <figure>
      <artwork><![CDATA[
augment "/rt:routing/rt:router/rt:routing-protocols/"
      + "rt:routing-protocol" {
  when "rt:type = 'rip:rip'";
  container rip {
    leaf update-interval {
      type uint8 {
        range "10..60";
      }
      units "seconds";
      default "30";
      description
        "Time interval between periodic updates.";
    }
  }
}]]></artwork>
        </figure>

    </section>

    <section anchor="sec.filters" title="Route Filters">
      <t>The core routing data model provides a skeleton for defining
      route filters that can be used to restrict the set of routes
      being exchanged between a routing protocol instance and a
      connected routing table, or between a source and a recipient
      routing table. Route filters may also manipulate routes, i.e.,
      add, delete, or modify their attributes.</t>
      <t>Route filters are global, which means that a configured route
      filter may be used by any or all router instances.</t>
      <t>By itself, the route filtering framework defined in this
      document allows for applying only two extreme routing
      policies which are represented by the following pre-defined
      route filter types:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>"deny-all-route-filter": all routes are blocked,</t>
        <t>"allow-all-route-filter": all routes are permitted.</t>
      </list>
      Note that the latter type is equivalent to no route filter.</t>
      <t>It is expected that more comprehensive route filtering
      frameworks will be developed separately.</t>
      <t>Each route filter is identified by a name which MUST be
      unique within the entire configuration. Its type MUST be
      specified by the "type" identity reference - this opens the
      space for multiple route filtering framework
      implementations. The default value for the route filter type is
      the identity "deny-all-route-filter".</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec.rpcs" title="RPC Operations">

      <t>The "ietf-routing" module defines two RPC operations:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>active-route: query the routing system for the active
	route(s) that are currently used for sending datagrams to a
	destination host whose address is passed as an input parameter.</t>

    are disabled but MUST NOT be deleted from the configuration by the

          the forwarding of IPv4 datagrams to and from this interface
          MUST be disabled. However, the interface may participate in
          other routing functions, such as routing protocols.

      </t>
      <t>In addition, the "ietf-ip" module allows for configuring IPv4
      and IPv6 addresses and subnet masks on network layer
      interfaces. Configuration of these parameters on an enabled
      interface MUST result in an immediate creation of the
      corresponding direct route (usually in the main routing
      table). Its destination prefix is set according to the
      configured IP address and subnet mask, and the interface is set
      as the outgoing interface for that route.</t>

    <t>The YANG modules defined in this document are designed to be
    accessed via the NETCONF protocol <xref target="RFC6241"/>.  The
    lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer and the
    mandatory-to-implement secure transport is SSH <xref target="RFC6242"/>.</t>
    <t>A number of data nodes defined in the YANG modules are
    writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true" in YANG terms,
    which is the default).  These data nodes may be considered
    sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write
    operations to these data nodes, such as "edit-config", can have
    negative effects on the network if the protocol operations are not
    properly protected.</t>
    <t>The vulnerable "config true" subtrees and data nodes are the
    following:
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="/rt:routing/rt:router/rt:interfaces/rt:interface">This
      list assigns a network layer interface to a router instance and
      may also specify interface parameters related to routing.</t>
      <t hangText="/rt:routing/rt:router/rt:routing-protocols/rt:routing-protocol">This
      list specifies the routing protocols configured on a device.</t>

      <t hangText="/rt:routing/rt:route-filters/rt:route-filter">This
      list specifies the configured route filters which represent
      administrative policies for redistributing and modifying routing
      information.</t>
    </list>
    
      Unauthorized access to any of these lists can adversely affect the
      routing subsystem of both the local device and the network. This
      may lead to network malfunctions, delivery of packets to
      inappropriate destinations and other problems.</t>

  <section anchor="app.rip" title="Example: Adding a New Routing Protocol">

    <t>This appendix demonstrates how the core routing data model can
    be extended to support a new routing protocol. The YANG module
    "example-rip" shown below is intended only as an illustration
    rather than a real definition of a data model for the RIP routing
    protocol. For the sake of brevity, we do not follow all the
    guidelines specified in <xref target="RFC6087"/>. See also <xref target="sec.newproto"/>.</t>
