This document proposes an informal management model of Differentiated
Services (Diffserv) routers for use in their management and
configuration.  This model defines functional datapath elements (e.g.,
classifiers, meters, actions, marking, absolute dropping, counting,
multiplexing), algorithmic droppers, queues and schedulers.  It
describes possible configuration parameters for these elements and how
they might be interconnected to realize the range of traffic
conditioning and per-hop behavior (PHB) functionalities described in
the Diffserv Architecture.

This document is a product of the Differentiated Services Working
Group of the IETF.
