        Control Plane Requirements for TRILL Active/Active Edge
             draft-zhang-trill-active-active-cp-req-00.txt

Abstract

   TRILL Active/Active Edge enables a Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation
   Group to connect to multiple RBridges which can ingress and egress
   data traffic for the same VLAN at the same time. The purpose of
   introducing the TRILL Active/Active Edge is to increase the access
   bandwidth and resilience. This new access type puts forward new
   requirements for TRILL control plane. Current TRILL control plane
   need be extended in order to make the TRILL Active/Active Edge
   operational. Requirements are developed in this document as the
   guidelines for designing those specific control plane functions.

INTERNET-DRAFT     Active/Active Control Requirements   October 21, 2013


1. Introduction

   TRILL makes use of IS-IS link state routing to provide least-cost
   forwarding between TRILL switches. At the edge, [RFC6349] already
   defines an active-standby access for end-stations. An active-active
   method is to be added in TRILL so that end stations are able to
   increase the bandwidth and resilience of their access to a TRILL
   campus using Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group (MC-LAG) [PS].
   Unlike a LAN link, MC-LAG does not exchange TRILL IS-IS PDUs. The
   TRILL switch ports attached to the MC-LAG demarcate the edge of TRILL
   and no adjacency can be formed on top of the MC-LAG. 

   From the point of view of the end stations, the MC-LAG is treated as
   if it were a single link and those RBridges connected to the other
   end of the MC-LAG need operate as if they were a single TRILL switch.
   Thus an Active/Active Edge (AAE) is set up. However, it doesn't mean
   that RBridges in the AAE can be connected to only one MC-LAG. It's
   possible that one port of an RBridge is connected to one MC-LAG and
   the other port is connected to another. 

   To achieve the TRILL Active/Active Edge, some functions should be
   added to the current TRILL control plane. There are several possible
   places to host these functions. For example, the TRILL IS-IS, TRILL
   BFD, ESADI protocol and TRILL Channel are potential choices [BFD]
   [ESADI] [Channel]. This document describes the high-level
   requirements for these new control plane functions. When specific
   protocols are designed, these requirements should be followed.

INTERNET-DRAFT     Active/Active Control Requirements   October 21, 2013


   This section specifies the requirements on the functions that the
   TRILL control plane need to provide for the AAE. 

3.1. Discovery 

   When an RBridge is attached to an MC-LAG, it need to recognize other
   RBridges attached to this MC-LAG as in the same AAE. It also need to
   notify other RBridges the fact that it joins or leaves the AAE.

   The identification of the AAE is REQUIRED during the discovery. The
   System Identifier of the MC-LAG is a choice. RBridges in an AAE MUST
   include this ID in the Protocol Data Units of the control plane
   protocol to achieve the discovery. 

3.2. Election

   RBridges per [RFC6325] run a protocol on the link to elect the
   Designated RBridge (DRB). The DRB performs some common tasks for the
   link. For example, the DRB gives the link a pseudonode nickname.

   RBridges in an AAE need elect a master node to carry on common tasks
   for the AAE as well. Since MC-LAG disables the delivery of TRILL IS-
   IS PDUs. The TRILL IS-IS election protocol defined in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC6325] is not applicable here. 

   A substitute election protocol SHOULD be set up. Such protocol should
   reuse the decision process algorithm defined in [ISIS] to avoid
   introducing too much complexity into TRILL. 

3.3. Forwarding Information Synchronization

   As an example, AAE members may learn MAC addresses through data plane
   learning and ESADI protocol. MAC addresses learnt by one member
   should be shared to other members in the same AAE in order to reduce
   the unknown unicast traffic [PS]. As another example, the IGMP
   (Internet Group Management Protocol) [RFC3376] snooping on those
   ports attached to a MC-LAG has to be synchronized. A protocol is
   needed to synchronize these forwarding information among AAE members
   and keep the information updated in a timely manner. 

   MAC address may be frequently updated due to data plane learning. It
   is REQUIRED that the CPU is not overloaded due to the control plane
   MAC address update. Therefore the protocol should define a minimum
   updating interval.

   Due to the overhead that may be produced, this protocol SHOULD be
   confined in the scope of the AAE members. Obviously, it SHOULD NOT be
   realized though the extension of TRILL IS-IS, which may otherwise

   introduce a heavy burden to current TRILL's control plane. TRILL
   ESADI or TRILL Channel are proper candidates to realize such
   protocol.

3.4. Failure Detection and Notification

   When a link of the MC-LAG to an AAE member RBridge or this RBridge
   itself is failed, this failure should be detected and notified to
   other AAE member RBridges through the control plane as soon as
   possible. RBridges other than AAE member RBridges may need be
   notified as well so that these RBridges can change their forwarding
   paths to avoid the failure.

   The failed AAE member RBridge leaves the AAE. It's possible that
   there is less than two RBridges in the AAE due to the failure. Then
   the AAE should be destroyed. If the AAE is not destroyed, the failure
   notification will trigger a re-convergence of the AAE. It is optional
   to establish a dedicated session such as BFD to detect the failure in
   order to enable a fast convergence. All AAE members MUST run into a
   consensus converge state just like the convergence in IGP routing
   protocols. The control plane protocols need take the design of the
   re-convergence algorithm into consideration.

3.5. Communicating Configuration Information 

   Configuration on RBridges to enable the operation of an AAE should be
   minimized. Some of the configuration is local while the other is of
   global sense and need be conveyed through the control plane to other
   RBridges. An example is the Affinity Sub-TLV defined in [6326bis] and
   used in [CMT].

   The communication of the configuration information through the
   control plane helps to settle mis-configuration. For example, enabled
   VLANs of every port attached to the same MC-LAG MUST be the same. An
   RBridge in an AAE can report the enabled VLANs to others through the
   control plane so that a mis-configured VLAN can be rectified or
   trigger an alarm to the management plane.

4. Security Considerations

   Security issue should be considered when a specific extension is made
   to the existing TRILL control plane. 

   Authenticity for contents transported in IS-IS PDUs is enforced using
   regular IS-IS security mechanism [ISIS][RFC5310]. 

   For security considerations pertain to extensions hosted by TRILL BFD
   and ESADI, corresponding documents should refer to the Security
