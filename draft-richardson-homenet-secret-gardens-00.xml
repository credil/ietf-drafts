  <t>
    This document explains a few use cases where operators would like
    to introduce so-called "walled gardens" into home-networks,
    including distribution of new DNS anchors.  This document proposes
    an alternative solution involving DNS delegations to access
    controlled DNS servers.  The results are much more scalable, and
    can be deployed today, using existing operating systems and
    existing DNS infrastructure.

<section title="Introduction: A brief history of split-horizon DNS">
<t>
DNS settings have been a regular concern since the very early 1990s,
when the first firewalls began to partition the Internet.  In the
earliest works, Cheswick and Bellovin describe the use of split-DNS in
an enterprise: all internal machines (including the inside interface
of the firewall, and possibly machines on the DMZ/Service-Network)
would use an internal recursive DNS server for names, and if the name
was external, the internal recursive DNS server would ask the world.
</t>
<t>
The above split-horizon configuration survives to today, but it has
become very complicated.  The first complication was remote access
(VPN) to the enterprise.  For the computer at home to be able access
things, the internal DNS server had to be used.  Often short internal
names ("smtp", "web", "wiki","printer") would be used, depending upon the
fact that all internal machines had the same search path.  As the VPN
could go on, and off, if it was off, and the end user entered the word
"wiki" on the browser, instead of going to the internal resource
(which in IPv4 space, had an RFC1918 address), it would either go to
an external resource, or cause a search.
</t>
<t>
Worse, some computer systems originally needed to be rebooted in order
to change their DNS settings, as this was really the only way to
convince all application to flush name to IP address mappings that
they had cached.
</t>
<t>
Particularly gruesome is the case of the contractor or consulting, who
works at enterprise A, and then visits enterprise B.  While on the
network of Enterprise B (where they may be located for some months),
in order to do simple things like reach the printer (using the name
"printer"), they need to use the DNS settings for Enterprise B.
But, in order to fetch their email, they must have the DNS settings
(and VPN) for their home base, Enterprise A.   There have been regular
reports in the VPN/Remote Access community of situations where a
worker needs to have VPNs up with two remote locations, while residing
at a third.
</t>
<t>
The VPN situation is tragic for the technical user, for the
non-technical user, it is impossible.  For the technical user, typing
in longer names, setting up multiple search paths, and running a local
recursive name server are possible.  For the less technical user,
typing in IP addresses rather than names works as long as HTTP Virtual
Hosting is not involved (for which the name is important).
But the degree to which these things occur has been limited in part
due to the inevitable conflict of RFC1918 addresses, which means,
that, even if one uses IP addresses, the routing doesn't work.
</t>
<t>
DNSSEC has put a new twist into things: the best way to run DNSSEC is
to have a secure recursive resolver.  Now, this recursive resolver
needs to be taught about split-horizon names, to talk to the internal
name server when it is reachable (and probably to trust it), and to
talk directly to the Internet when not reachable.  A second problem is
that the local recursive name server may not always get flushed. If a
query for "smtp.example.com" should result in the internal mail relay
when at the office, or connected via VPN, but the same name should
resolve in the external address when not connected (possibly, the same
machine with multiple interfaces, but not always), then the caching
presents a problem.  This problem is acute if one tries to run a
caching name server on a mobile, multiple-interface devices, such as a
stock smartphone that has 3G and wifi interfaces, which may operate
concurrently. 
</t>
<t>
Some organizations, where there are multiple data centres, and the
network is distinctly non-convex, have solved the caching problem by
dispensing with a true split-horizon DNS, and have simply put all
external names under "example.com", with internal names under
"internal.example.com".   Whether or not externally made requests
for foo.internal.example.com are resolved by externally facing
authoritative name servers is now a security policy question, rather
than a routing or caching concern.
</t>
<t>
There have been further abuses of split-horizon DNS.  One of these is
by hotels and other places with "captive portals".  In order to
authenticate the user using a web interface, they must make the portal
visible to the user.  This involves making the user "captive": no
packets may leave the local network until the user has sufficiently
authenticated (possibly, involving a financial transaction).  Some
captive portals have decided that they will intercept all DNS
requests, and no matter what the user asks for, they will answer with
their own name.  This can fail for three reasons: 1) the user does not
use the DNS servers provided, instead uses their own (perhaps
intending to be reached through a VPN) or or the root name servers
directly (perhaps in order to do DNSSEC), 2) the names used in the web
interfaces are unqualified ones, and the user has not accepted the
search path from the DHCP offer (ref: some BCP on this), 3) even if
all of this goes well, the user's browser has now cached an incorrect
mapping for the desired web site.

<section title="Use Cases">
<t>
This section lists a few use cases which homenet believes are within
scope.  Only the business goals are listed.
</t>

  <section title="IPv6 TV">
    <t>
A seperate internet connection is provided by the IP TV provider.
This can be on a seperate physical wire, or a seperate logical wire.
Historically, only the TV set itself is placed on this network, the
home owner may be unaware that the wires are other than analog cable
TV wires.
    </t>
<t>
The TV set does DNS lookups for the content servers, and is expected
to receive answers that are within the IP TV provider's network.  
The TV set can access the provider's servers as long as it originates 
connections from the IPv6 prefix that the IP TV provider provided.
</t>
<t>
The provider does not publish the addresses of the servers publically,
and does not want to.  Even if the servers can be accessed from the
Internet by IP address, they will not serve any TV content that
way. It is more likely that the content servers are completely
inaccessible from the Internet via firewall rules and/or routing horizons.
</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Corporate VPN">
    <t>
The corporate VPN use case involves an employee of an enterprise
connecting to the enterprise's network via an IP over IP
tunnel.  IPsec is a typical technology, and there are various
kinds of SSL VPNs, but this use case concerns itself with scenarios
where IPv6 pakets will be routed through the tunnel.  
(Some SSL VPNs provide TCP, usually HTTP-only services. They are not relevant)
     </t>
<t>
As described in the introduction, the Corporate VPN is almost the
original walled garden: there is a seperate routing domain (RFC1918 in
IPv4, End-User Assigned IPv6, Non-Connected Network or ULA for IPv6),
and there is an addition a desire to have an island of DNS.
</t>
<t>
Some corporate VPNs have a policy that all traffic from the employees'
computing device must go through the tunnel, even traffic not
addressed to the Enterprise. (That is, the default route on the laptop
must point through the tunnel.  A host route for the VPN tunnel end
point is usually created to permit the encapsulated traffic to travel,
or another kind of source-address sensitive policy route is used to
create multiple routing tables).   These types of VPNs are sometimes
called an extruded IP VPN: if the enterprise' network is thought of as
a fungible sponge, then the laptop user at home as an IP address, from
the corporate cloud/sponge, extruded, rather like a sea urchin (??)
extends a pseudopod.
</t>
<t>
It is not unusual for the networks of enterprises to grow to be very
complex:  multiple sites with multiple (sometimes overlapping IPv4
RFC1918) address spaces.  With IPv6, enterprises are likely to have 
fewer blocks of addresses, and none will overlap, but due to
acquisitions the number of blocks will still be greater than one.
</t>
<t>
Frequent teleworkers often have an entire home office connected to the
enterprise network.  This can include a selection of desktop
computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones (on wifi).  
The home office network might have several subnets (at least one wired
and one wireless).  These teleworkers usually have a VPN router as
their home gateway, and often these devices are controlled by the
Enterprise IT.  Just the same, access to the rest of the homenet is
desired such that the home worker(s) can share things like printers,
talk to home automation from their desk, and to avoid having
large-bandwidth cross the corporate network unnecessarily.
</t>
<t>
More about DNS expectations of enterprises.  ActiveDirectory is
relevant here.
</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Multi-homed to 3G/LTE">
   <t>
There is a problem here: so far it sounds like it's just IP TV over again.
   </t>
   </section>
</section>

<section title="Walled Garden DNS">
<t>
There have been proposals for each ISP/connectivity provider to
provide a suffix, such as "mytv.example." or even unregistered names
like ".internal" (common with ActiveDirectory) into the homenet.
</t>
<t>
Along with suffix would be one or more DNS servers, accessible via the
semi-private connection, which would resolve names in that zone. 
</t>
<t>
The proposal is for the suffix/server
extensions/appendages/?-needs-name-? to be made visible up to near the
application.  At least, if there is a local recursive name server,
then it could be the one point which gets updated (this is what some
VPN clients do), or it may require applications to be aware, and to
use alternative resolver libraries.
