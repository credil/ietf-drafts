 Multiple Repository Publication Points support in the Resource Public
                       Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
           draft-rogaglia-sidr-multiple-publication-points-01

Abstract

   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) depends on Relying
   Parties (RP) ability to access its Trust Anchors' certificate
   specified in the different "Trust Anchor Locator (TAL)" files and the
   Repository Objects located at the Certificate Authorities (CA)
   repositories hosted in its respective publication point.  This
   document updates [RFC6490] by allowing multiple URI associated to a
   single public key in a TAL file and introduces the concept of
   multiple repository publication point operators for every CA in the
   RPKI.  This document provides also recommendation for the RP behavior
   when analyzing signed objects that include multiple publications
   points.

2.  Introduction

   When thinking on how to scale the RPKI repository system described in
   [RFC6481] CA operators have a number of options such as:

   o  Give the content to a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to have the
      content distributed (as long as the CDN supports the access method
      for the CA, which at this time is rsync).

   o  Copy the content to different Repository Publication Points around
      the globe (i.e. using [I-D.ietf-sidr-publication]) and load
      balance the content using different Domain Name System (DNS)
      techniques.

   When using any of these scaling technique to a unique CA Repository
   Publication Point URI, there is a dependency in the resolution of a
   single Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).  Also, when a single
   operator manages a RPKI Repository Publication Point, it is possible
   to introduce circular dependencies when the Route Origin
   Authorization (ROA) signed objects for the Repository Publication
   Point IP addresses are hosted in servers that uses those same
   addresses.  The idea of having multiple Repository Publication Points
   operators for a RPKI CA mitigates these risks and is complementary to
   any other scaling solution (as the ones described above).

   The first thing that is needed is to add multiple URIs support for
   each Trust Anchor.  [RFC6490] requires that each TAL file includes a
   unique URI.  This document remove this requirement by allowing one or
   more URI for each public key in a TAL file.

   A CA can add support for multiple Repository Publication Points
   operators by adding more than one respective object for the Authority
   Information Access (AIA), the Subject Information Access (SIA) and
   the CRL Distribution Points (CRLDP) and which is supported by
   [RFC5280] and [RFC6487] .

   The addition of multiple Repository Publication Points operators for
   CAs in the RPKI introduces complexity for the RP.  This documents
   provide some recommendations for RP implementors.

3.  Multiple Operators support in TAL files

   The idea of multiples operators support for a Trust Anchor
   certificate expressed on its TAL file is similar to the support for
   several Root Server operators in a DNS hints file.

   An example of such a TAL file with 3 operators would be:

   rsync://rpki.operator1.org/rpki/hedgehog/root.cer
   rsync://rpki.operator2.net/rpki/hedgehog/root.cer
   rsync://rpki.operator3.biz/rpki/hedgehog/root.cer

   MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAovWQL2lh6knDx
   GUG5hbtCXvvh4AOzjhDkSHlj22gn/1oiM9IeDATIwP44vhQ6L/xvuk7W6

   aJ0qANT9OtnfSDOS+aLRPjZryCNyvvBHxZXqj5YCGKtwIDAQAB

   As we can see in this example, a RP would have different URI where to
   fetch the self-signed certificate for the trust anchor.  In each
   location, the same result should be expected as all the URI share the
   same public key.

   In order to increase in diversity, It is RECOMMENDED that different
   FQDN could be resolved to IP addresses included in ROA objects from
   different CAs and hosted in diverse Repository Publication Points.

3.1.  Update to RFC 6490 Section 2.1

   The following text will replace the last paragraph on Section 2.1 of
   RFC 6490:

   The TAL is an ordered sequence of:

   1) One or more rsync URI [RFC5781],

   2) A <CRLF> or <LF> line break after each URI,

   3) A line containing a single <CRLF> or <LF> line break, and

   4) A subjectPublicKeyInfo [RFC5280] in DER format [X.509], encoded in
   Base64 (see Section 4 of [RFC4648]).A

3.2.  Rules for Relying Parties (RP)

   A RP can use different rules to select the URI from where fetch the
   Trust Anchor certificate.  Some examples are:

   o  Using the order provided in the TAL file

   o  Selecting the URI randomly from the available list

   o  Creating a prioritized list of URIs based on RP specific
      parameters such as connection establishment delay

   If the connection to the preferred URI fails or the fetched
   certificate public key does not match the TAL public key, the RP
   SHOULD fetch the TA certificate from the next URI of preference.

4.  Multiple Operators support in Certificates

   The support for multiple operators in the RPKI Certificate Authority
   (CA) and End Entity (EE) certificates is supported as the RFC 5082
   allows multiple repository publication point operators as the SIA,
   AIA and CRLDP are implemented as sequences.  Consequently, no changes
   are needed on the existing RPKI standard and this section could be
   considered informative.

   In the case of the SIA extension, for each operator, the
   accessMethods for both the CA repository publication point and for
   the correspondent manifest needs to be added.

4.1.  Rules for Relying Parties (RP)

   A RP can use different rules to select the URI to fetch the different
   repository objects and when performing the validation.

   When a RP needs to fetch one or more object from a list of possible
   URIs, it can chose the URI by adopting a locally defined rule that
   could be:

   o  Using the order provided in the correspondent certificate

   o  Selecting the URI randomly from the available list

   o  Creating a prioritized list of URIs based on RP specific
      parameters such as connection establishment delay

   If the connection to the preferred URI fails , the RP SHOULD fetch
   the repository objects from the next URI of preference.
