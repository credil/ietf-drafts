Internet-Draft          Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) November 2013


1. Introduction

   Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) is a component in Network
   Virtualization Overlays Technology. This component is described in
   the NVO3 framework [NVO3FRWK] and architecture [NV03ARCH]. This
   document specifies NVE data plane functionality. The functionality
   specifications are necessary for the interoperability between an NVE
   and its attached tenant systems and between the NVEs. The data plane
   functionality described in this document is independent of NVE or
   NVO3 control plane functionality. Thus, the control plane
   functionality is outside the scope of this document. However the
   specifications in this document can support any control plane
   implementation.

   NVE data plane functionality essential is the packet forwarding. It
   receives a packet from a tenant system via a virtual access point
   (VAP), processes it, and forwards it to the peer NVE via an overlay
   tunnel or forwards to a local VAP; it receives a packet from a peer
   NVE, processes it, and forwards it to a tenant system via a VAP. In
   the process, an NVE may modify the packet header and/or
   insert/remove the tunnel header on the packet prior to the
   forwarding. The tunnel encapsulation protocol is outside the scope
   of this document.

   In order to make NVO3 data plane work properly, some configurations
   on NVEs are necessary. They can be done manually or in automation.
   How these configurations are done is outside the scope of the
   document.

  1.1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

  1.2. Terminology

   This document uses the terms defined in NVO3 framework [NVO3FRWK]
   and architecture [NVO3ARCH] documents.

2. NVE Design Consideration

   NVE design goals are:

     1. The solution supports multi-tenancy in a common underlying
        network.



Yong, et al              Expires May 3, 2014                   [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) November 2013

     2. The solution support different types of tenant systems and
        require no change on tenant system configuration and behavior.

     3. The solution is agnostic to NVE location, i.e. regardless NVE
        is co-located with tenant systems on a server/device or
        physically separated from tenant systems.

     4. No change on tenant system configuration and behavior whether
        a gateway or distributed gateway is used.

     5. The solution must support virtual machine (VM) mobility.

     6. The solution must be scalable in supporting a VN having many
        NVEs each of which may have many attached tenant systems; and
        in supporting an NVE being the members of several VNs and
        having many attached tenant systems that belong to the same or
        different VNs.

   Note that NVO3 architecture [NVO3ARCH] defines NVE and NVA entities;
   the goal 5 and 6 achievement depends on both NVE and NVA. This
   document only focuses on NVE data plane functionality. The
   interaction between NVE and NVA, between NVAs, and between
   hypervisor and NVE are outside the scope of the document.

3. Tenant Systems

   NVO3 architecture [NVO3] defines several types of tenant systems.
   Following sections describes these tenant systems in terms of their
   role and networking behavior.

  3.1. Virtual Machines and Bare Metal Servers

   Tenant system may be a virtual machine on a server or a bare metal
   server. For a virtual machine, Guest OS runs on the tenant system
   and application software runs on top of Guest OS. For a bare metal
   server, host OS runs on the server and application software runs on
   top of it. Here is the summary of such tenant system networking
   behavior:

     .  A tenant system (TS) is configured with a subnet such as
        10.1.1.0/24 and a default GW IP address, and TS MAC and IP
        address (manually or automatically). Note that TS IP address
        MUST be an address in the subnet. How to configure these
        addresses is outside the scope of document.

Internet-Draft          Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) November 2013

     .  A tenant system learns the MAC address of the peer in the same
        subnet by using ARP protocol and may learn it from the source
        MAC address on the packet as well.

     .  A tenant system learns the GW MAC address by using ARP
        protocol. The GW entity MUST support ARP protocol.

     .  A tenant system may cache the interested destination IP and
        MAC address for the packet forwarding.

     .  For intra subnet forwarding, a tenant system inserts the
        destination MAC address on the packet.

     .  For inter subnet forwarding, a tenant system inserts the GW
        MAC address on the packet.

     .  A tenant system may filter received packets and only accept
        the packet with the designation MAC address on it is the same
        as its MAC address.

  3.2. Network Service Appliances

   A network service appliance such as load balancer or firewall can
   act as a tenant system and provide a service to one or more VNs (via
   distinct VAPs). A network service appliance can be implemented on a
   physical device, a bare metal server, or a virtual machine on a
   server. The last one is often referred as Virtualized Network
   Function (VNF). A tenant system, as a network service appliance, may
   have different configuration and behavior as a host as described in
   section 3.1. The tenant system may attach to an NVE via a local VLAN
   interface, IP interface, or directly attached port/vport and act as
   a middle box in a VN. Typically, the configuration or policy on the
   local NVE determines which VN traffic or traffic flows are forwarded
   to the tenant system. In other words, the local NVE does not forward
   the packets to the tenant system based on the destination address on
   the packets. Such tenant system may also be the member of multiple
   VNs via distinct virtual access points (VAPs), respectively, and may
   forward the received traffic back to the same VN or to a different
   VN. The tenant system may even modify the received packets prior to
   forwarding them, e.g. Network Address Translation (NAT).

  3.3. Gateways

   A gateway may be used to interconnect two NV03 VNs, or between an
   NV03 VN and other networks that may be virtual, physical, or between
   an NV03 VN and Internet, or a combination of these. A gateway can
   also interconnect two VNs that are implemented with different NVE

   types. A gateway may be implemented on a physical device, a bare
   metal server, or a VM. For a gateway that interconnects two NVO3 VNs,
   it may be also implemented with distributed gateway. Distributed
   gateway means a gateway function implemented on NVEs so that the
   traffic between the VNs can be forwarded at local NVE; as the result,
   path optimization is gained. This document describes the distributed
   gateway function at NVEs. It is often that a gateway integrates with
   several other network service appliances such as NAT, firewall and
   policy based forwarding for the interconnection need, which means
   that inter-VN traffic gets these special treatments.

   A gateway can be implemented as a Tenant System, in which it is like
   a network service appliance described in section 3.2. A gateway can
   also be implemented as a network device, i.e. have embedded NVE
   component; which means that the gateway has to support NVE
   capability and interwork with other NVEs seamlessly. In the rest of
   document, it describes a gateway as an entity which can be
   implemented in either way.

4. Network Virtualization Edge (NVE)

   NVO3 framework [NVO3FRWK] defines three NVE service types: L2
   service, L3 service, and L2/L3 service. A tenant network can be
   implemented with one of NVE types or the combination w/ a gateway. A
   VN containing different NVE service types is for further study.

  4.1. NVE Service Type

   4.1.1. L2 NVE Service

   An L2 VN can be implemented with L2 NVE service type and provides L2
   broadcast domain to the tenant systems on the VN. The tenant system
   attaches to the NVE via a VLAN, directly attached port or virtual
   port. For the scalability and performance concern, an NVE should not
   forward the ARP request message to remote NVEs. If the interested
   tenant system at a remote NVE, the local NVE sends the ARP response
   with the remote MAC address back. An NVE can obtain the remote
   tenant system MAC address via NVA.[NVO3ARCH] The L2 overlay is used
   between NVEs (NVE gets the inner/outer address mapping from NVA).
   Note that, an L2 virtual network overlay provides a single broadcast
   domain. Figure 1 illustrates a VN with L2 NVE service type. As shown
   in the Figure, TSs attach to an NVE via the VAPs that are associated
   to the L2 VNIx on the NVE. L2 Overlay is used between the NVEs that
   are the members of a VN. The VN ID is encoded in the overlay header
   on the packets.

                      Figure 1 L2 NVE Service Model

   L2 NVE service supports a broadcast domain in the VN. How to
   transport broadcast/multicast traffic among NVEs requires a way to
   map the VN broadcast/multicast traffic to a underlying IP multicast
   solution. IP network does not support a multicast solution yet and
   relies on PIM to support multicast transport. An NVE can send the VN
   broadcast/multicast traffic to the remote NVEs by using unicast
   outer IP address on the packets, i.e. replicating in the underlying
   network. This method does not require the underlying network to
   support a multicast transport. How NVA conveys such mapping
   information to NVEs is outside the scope of the document.

   To interconnect with external virtual or physical networks or an
   overlay or non-overlay virtual network, a gateway is necessary. The
   gateway participates in the L2 VN and performs the traffic treatment
   between the interconnected networks.

   L2 NVE service may apply to non-IP and IP applications. However IP
   based application can be implemented in other ways too. (see below)

   To use NVE data plane learning of mapping between remote tenant
   system MAC and remote NVE IP address mapping, and for a remote
   tenant system to use ARP in notifying its MAC address is for further
   study.

   4.1.2. L3 NVE Service

   An L3 VN can be implemented with L3 NVE service type and provide L3
   routing domain for the tenant systems in the VN. The VAP can be an
   IP interface, attached port/vport, or a VLAN interface. An NVE acts
   as the first hop router to the attached tenant systems. For the VLAN
   interface, i.e. Ethernet access interface, the NVE needs support ARP
   protocol, terminates all ARP request messages, and reply its MAC
   address to the tenant system. An NVE tracks the tenant system IP and
   MAC address mapping if L2 access is used unless the special
   configuration is done on the NVE. (see section 3.2).

   When a tenant system forwards packets to an attached NVE, the NVE
   receives either IP packets or Ethernet frames with NVE MAC address


Yong, et al              Expires May 3, 2014                   [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) November 2013

   as the destination MAC on the packets depending on VAP interface
   type. The NVE performs an IP table lookup based on the destination
   IP address on the packets. If the packet needs to forward to another
   NVE, the NVE sends it via L3 overlay (NVE obtains the inner/outer
   address mapping from NVA). If the packet needs to be forwarded to a
   local VAP, and the VAP is Ethernet access, the NVE inserts the
   destination MAC address on the packet prior to sending it to the
   tenant system; if the VAP is an IP interface, the NVE sends IP
   packet directly.

   How NVE obtains local tenant system IP and MAC addresses is outside
   the scope of this document. The rule of thumb is that such method
   MUST not require any change on the tenant system side.

   The tenant systems connecting to an L3 VN can be on the same or
   different subnets. A special case of this VN is that the VN provides
   the connectivity for all intra and inter subnets, which brings
   optimal path. Typically, subnet or flow based policies may be
   configured for route constraint or route path control policies may
   be configured depending on the tenant network requirements. Figure 2
   depicts an L3 VN model.

                      Figure 2  L3 NVE Service Model

   If an L3 VN needs to interconnect with external networks, Internet,
   or another VN, a gateway MUST be used. To avoid address collision,
   either IP address space partition or IP address translation between
   two VNs at a gateway is necessary. The former, in turn, looks like
   one routing domain with one IP space shared between two virtual
   networks. For two L3 VNs interconnection, NVEs may be function as
   distributed gateway and perform both intra-VN routing/forwarding and
   inter-VN routing/forwarding/gateway. Figure 3 depicts an L3 NVE w/
   distributed gateway. As shown in the Figure, TSs attach to an NVE
   via the VAPs that are associated to the L3 VNIx or L3 VNIy on the
   NVE. L3 Overlay is used between the NVEs that are the members of the
   VNx and VNy. The VNx and VNy IDs are encoded in the overlay header
   on the packets. Section 5.3 discusses operation considerations in
   use of a gateway or distributed gateway.

                   Figure 3 L3 NVE Service w/dGW Model

   Note: an L3 VN, as a route domain, does not support broadcast and
   multicast function. Applicability for MVPN [RFC4834] to NVO3 is for
   further study. It is obvious that L3 NVE service type only supports
   IP based application.

   4.1.3. L2/L3 NVE Service

   L2/L3 NVE service type is used for multiple L2 VNs w/ distributed L3
   gateway function on NVEs, or L2 VNs and L3 VNs interconnected w/
   distributed L3 gateway function on NVEs.

   In the former case, the VAP may be VLAN or port/vport based. Tenant
   systems on the same L2 VN or different L2 VNs may be on the same or
   different NVEs. The tenant systems on the same L2 VN are in a
   broadcast domain and can be communicated without a constraint. The
   implementation looks like L2 NVE described above. For the traffic
   across L2 VNs, i.e. from one L2 VN to another, the tenant system
   sends the packet to a GW with GW MAC address that is configured on
   the local NVE. The same MAC address should be used on all NVEs. (Use
   of different GW MAC address on NVEs is for further study). The NVE
   performs the IP table lookup and gets the destination VN, and gets
   the destination MAC address, and outer address or VAP address in the
   VN, then replace VN ID and destination MAC address on the packet,
   and further adds the outer addresses on the packet if sending to a
   peer NVE or send to the VAP where destination tenant system attaches
   to. L2 overlay is used between NVEs (NVE get the inner/outer address
   mapping from NVA). Operator can configure the communication policy

   between L2 VNs not only for unicast traffic but also
   broadcast/multicast traffic. The latter allows broadcast/multicast
   traffic sending to another L2 VN network. The policy can be
   associated to VNs instead of subnets or flows.

   In the latter case, the L2 VN implementation on NVEs is like the L2
   NVE described in section 4.1.1, the L3 VN implementation on NVEs is
   like the L3 NVE described in section 4.1.2. The distributed L3
   gateway function on NVEs is used for local inter-VN traffic
   described above and policy be used for inter-VN traffic control.
   Figure 4 illustrates the model for NVE L2/L3 service type. The NVEs
   in this case maintain both tenant system IP and MAC addresses.

   The tenant network with multiple L2 VNs and L3 VNs interconnected
   w/distributed L3 gateway function MUST share the same IP and MAC
   address space. If the tenant network further interconnects with
   other tenant networks, external, or Internet via a gateway, either
   IP and/or MAC address partition or address translation MUST be used.
   An L2/L3 VN interconnecting to Internet is the second case in
   general.

  4.2. Overlay Tunnel between NVEs

   NVE may implement L2 overlay or L3 overlay depending on NVE types. A
   tunnel between two NVEs may be over one underlying network
   segment/domain or span across multiple network domains. Both NVEs
   need to use the same encapsulation protocol to encap/decap packets
   to/from a tunnel in between. There are several encapsulation methods
   in the industry such as VXLAN [VXLAN], NVGRE [NVGRE]. If two NVEs do

Internet-Draft          Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) November 2013

   not support one same encapsulation method, the gateway may be used
   for the encapsulation translation. (It would be nice for DC operator
   and IETF to influence the industry to have one encapsulation
   protocol for the virtual network, which simplify the solution and
   lower its cost.)  A P2MP tunnel or MP2MP tunnel may be used for
   multicast traffic transport. According to NVO3 architecture, an NVE
   relies on the NVA to obtain the inner/outer address mapping and the
   underlying network supports the IP connectivity between two NVEs.
   How NVA obtains the mapping information is outside the scope of the
   document.

   The encapsulation process on an NVE also needs convey the packet
   characteristics in a VN to the underlying network, i.e. encode or
   translate the packet parameters in the inner header to the outer
   header, so that the packet can get the same treatment in the
   underlying network.[NVO3DPREQ]. Some examples are CoS value, and
   entropy information calculation. The detail will be updated in next
   version.

  4.3. Multi-Tenancy Support

   It is very important for NVO3 to support multi-tenancy over a common
   physical infrastructure, and ensures independent address space in
   individual tenant networks that are not communicated directly, i.e.
   only communicate with address translation or via Internet, and
   traffic isolation among them. NVE MUST maintain separated forwarding
   tables to support address overlapping. Since a tenant network may
   have one virtual or multiple virtual networks, it is important for a
   tenant or DC operator to manage the address allocation for the
   virtual networks in a tenant network to avoid address collision. A
   tunnel between NVEs may carry the traffic belonging to different
   virtual networks. The VN ID in the overlay header serves the traffic
   segregation.

  4.4. Route Path Control

   A tenant network may be implemented as a full mesh among NVEs and
   not have a policy on route path at all. As the result, single hop is
   between sender TS and destination TS. A tenant network may contain
   some tenant systems that are designated as a network service
   appliance. In the case, tenant may want some tenant traffic passing
   through some network service appliance prior to delivering to the
   destination tenant and some are not. For example, Tenant network is
   implemented with three VNs in a DC. One L2 VN is for Web Tier,
   second L2 VN is for application tier; third L2 VN is for Database
   Tier. The policies are illustrated in the following figure. Traffic
   from the Web Tier to the App Tier MUST pass through tenant firewall



Yong, et al              Expires May 3, 2014                  [Page 11]

   on the Tenant System, say A; The traffic from App Tier to Web Tier
   can be directly routed; Traffic between App Tier and DB Tier MUST
   pass tenant firewall on tenant system, say B. No communication is
   allowed between the Web Tier and the DB Tier.

         Web Tier ----FW A---->  App Tier ----FW B---->  DB Tier
                  <-----------           <----FW B-----

             Figure 5 Polices on a Three-Tier Tenant Network

   In this case, An NVE attached by the firewall tenant system A is
   configured to forward all the traffic from Web Tier to the system A
   via a VAP. The system A processes the packets and may forward the
   packets to the App Tier via another VAP that is associated to App
   Tier on the NVE. The NVE forwards to the tenant systems in App Tier
   on behalf of the system A.  The traffic from App Tier can be
   forwarded to the Web Tier directly. The NVE simply obtains the
   inner/outer address mapping and translate VN IDs on the packets
   prior to forwarding to the peer NVEs. Thus, in the pass-thru
   firewall case, the inner/outer address mapping that an NVE gets from
   NVA is not destination tenant address (inner)/its NVE address; the
   outer address is the address of the NVE which the system A attaches
   to. The NVO3 architecture, such route path control can be
   implemented in NVA, NVE, or both. How to implement such policies on
   NVE is either beyond the scope of the document or for further study.

  4.5. Split NVE

   Split NVE may be used in several use cases [NVO3ARCH]. Some NVE
   functions may reside on NVE spoke and some are on NVE hub. The
   detail description will be in next version.

  4.6. Multi-Homing Support

   When an NVE is physically separated from attached tenant systems, a
   tenant system may attach to one or more NVEs via the VAPs.

   The detail description comes soon.

  4.7. OAM Tools on NVE

   It is necessary for an NVE to support some OAM tools. A tool can be
   turned on when a tunnel or VN is set up or dynamically turned on
   according to operation needs.

   NVE may support following tools.

   requirement [NV03OAM].

5. Operation Considerations

  5.1. VM Mobility

   VM Mobility provides some benefits for DC operator in term of
   resource optimizations and performance turning. If a tenant system
   on a VM acts as a guest OS and runs application software, it can be
   moved from one NVE to another NVE without an network impact. If the
   tenant systems running a network service appliances software, it may
   not easily move from one NVE to another NVE because there are some
   special configuration and policy on the NVE and tenant system to
   make it work. (See section 3.2) Furthermore if a VN is implemented
   with a special route graph instead of the "full" mesh route topology
   among NVEs, moving a VM from one NVE to another may require the
   route graph change, which may require some configuration changes on
   NVEs.

   A VN ID is used to segregate the traffic for different VNs in data
   plane, or say on "wire". NVE implementation may use a domain-wide
   global VN ID or egress NVE assigned local VN ID in the data plane.
   If use of local VN ID, when a VM moves from one NVE to another, a
   sender NVE not only has to obtain the new NVE address the VM moves
   to, i.e. the outer addresses, also has to obtain the new VN ID the
   new NVE allocating for the VN. In other words, the ingress NVE has
   to modify both overlay header and outer header when a VM moves from
   one NVE to another. If a domain-wide VN ID is used on NVEs, an
   ingress NVE only need to modify the outer header when a VN moves.
   Although local allocated VN ID adds implementation complexity for VM
   mobility, it has advantage in associating VN ID with other context
   at egress NVE to facilitate egress NVE packet processing. Thus, both
   methods should be allowed.

  5.2. NVE Service Type Choice for a Tenant Network

   Come soon.

  5.3. Gateway vs. Distributed Gateway

   A gateway is used, in general, to interconnect two networks. A
   gateway can be implemented on a physical device, a bare metal server,
   or a VM on a server. The gateway in NVO3 means a virtual network
   overlay interconnecting with other networks. The other network can
   be a physical network, a virtual network, a virtual network overlay,
   or Internet, which is often called an external network. Distributed

Internet-Draft          Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) November 2013

   gateway is a gateway function that is implemented on the NVEs so the
   traffic between two tenant systems in different virtual networks can
   be routed on the local NVE directly. The BIG benefit to use the
   distributed gateway is path optimization, which is important for
   some cloud applications and underlying networks.

   To interconnect two networks, a gateway may integrate with other
   network service appliances such as NAT, Firewall and handle policy
   based forwarding. This means that inter-VN traffic subjects to this
   additional treatment. Note that operator often uses this as a rule
   in application network design. When implementing distributed gateway,
   that means that NVEs also need support such capability, which,
   sometimes, become not practical.

   Should a tenant uses a gateway or distributed gateway for two VN
   interconnection? Here are the general recommendations.

      .  If a VN overlay interconnects to an external network that is a
        physical network, virtual network, or Internet, using a gateway
        is practical.

      .  If a VN overlay in a DC interconnects to another VN overlay in
        another DC, the inter-VN traffic will pass through DC GWs, i.e.
        traffic pattern is north-south, it is good to use a gateway.

      .  If a VN overlay interconnects to anther VN overlay within a DC,
        i.e. traffic pattern is easy-west, and there is light network
        service appliance function and/or policies for inter-VN traffic,
        using distributed gateway is better; otherwise use a gateway.

   A gateway can interwork with distributed gateway to serve external
   network interconnection. If some NVE in a VN can support distributed
   gateway and other can't, a VN can have both distributed gateway and
   a gateway, which means that the traffic between two tenant systems
   may be routed/forwarded locally on a gateway supported NVE or may be
   hire-pin via a gateway if local NVE does not support a distributed
   gateway function. This may happen in the network migration period.
   How to configure and manage a gateway and distributed gateway is
   beyond the scope of this document.
