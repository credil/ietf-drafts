                      PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH)
                          draft-miller-posh-00

Abstract

   This document defines two methods that make it easier to deploy
   certificates for proper server identity checking in application
   protocols.  The first method enables a TLS client to obtain a TLS
   server's end-entity certificate over secure HTTP as an alternative to
   standard Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) and DNS-Based
   Authentication of Named Entities (DANE).  The second method enables a
   source domain to securely delegate an application to a derived domain
   using HTTPS redirects.

Internet-Draft                    POSH                         June 2013


1.  Introduction

   Channel encryption with TLS depends on proper checking of the
   server's identity, as specified in [RFC6125] or its application-
   specific equivalent for Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX)
   [RFC5280] and in [RFC6698] for DNS-Based Authentication of Named
   Entities (DANE).  However, in multi-tenanted environments it is
   effectively impossible for a hosting service to offer the correct
   PKIX certificates on behalf of a hosted domain, since neither party
   wants the hosting service to hold the hosted domain's private keys.
   As a result, typically the hosting service offers its own PKIX
   certificate (say, for hosting.example.net), which means that TLS
   clients need to "just know" that the hosted domain (say,
   foo.example.com) is offered at the hosting service rather than the
   hosted domain.  Further background information on this problem can be
   found in [XMPP-DNA].

   This situation is clearly insecure.  It is true that DNS-based
   technologies are emerging for secure delegation, in the form of DNS
   SRV records [RFC2782] or their functional equivalent when DNS
   Security [RFC4033] is used, along with DNS-Based Authentication of
   Named Entities (DANE) [RFC6698].  However, these technologies are not
   yet widely deployed and might not be deployed in the near future for
   domains outside the most common top-level domains.  Hosting services
   and hosted domains need a method that can be deployed more quickly to
   overcome the lack of secure delegation and proper server identity
   checking on the Internet today.

   POSH (PKIX Over Secure HTTP) provides two interconnected methods for
   solving the problem, at least with application protocols other than
   HTTP:

   1.  A TLS client retrieves the material to be used in checking the
       TLS server's identity by requesting it from a well-known HTTPS
       URI, where the response contains one or more certificates
       formatted as a JSON Web Key set [JOSE-JWK] defined within the
       JOSE WG.

   2.  If a hosted domain securely delegates an application to a hosting
       service, it redirects all requests for the well-known HTTPS URI
       to an HTTPS URI at the hosting service.

2.  Terminology

   This document inherits security terminology from [RFC5280].  The
   terms "source domain", "derived domain", "reference identifier", and
   "presented identifier" are used as defined in the "CertID"
   specification [RFC6125].

   This document uses the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
   (XMPP) [RFC6120] in its examples.  Whether connections are made from
   an XMPP client to an XMPP server (based on a DNS SRV record of
   "_xmpp-client._tcp") or between XMPP servers ("_xmpp-server._tcp"),
   the XMPP initiating entity acts as a TLS client and the XMPP
   receiving entity acts as a TLS server.  Therefore, to simplify
   discussion this document uses "_xmpp-client._tcp" to describe both
   cases, unless otherwise indicated.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  Obtaining Verification Materials

   Server identity checking (see [RFC6125]) involves three different
   aspects:

   1.  A proof of the TLS server's identity (in PKIX, this takes the
       form of a PKIX certificate [RFC5280]).
   2.  Rules for checking the certificate (which vary by application
       protocol, although [RFC6125] attempts to harmonize those rules).
   3.  The materials that a TLS client uses to verify the TLS server's
       identity or check the TLS server's proof (in PKIX, this takes the
       form of chaining the end-entity certificate back to a trusted
       root and performing all validity checks as described in
       [RFC5280], [RFC6125], and the relevant application protocol
       specification).

   When POSH is used, the first two aspects remain the same: the TLS
   server proves it identity by presenting a PKIX certificate [RFC5280]
   and the certificate is checked according to the rules defined in the
   appropriate application protocol specification (such as [RFC6120] for
   XMPP).  However, the TLS client obtains the material it will use to
   verify the server's proof by retrieving a JSON Web Key (JWK) set
   [JOSE-JWK] over HTTPS ([RFC2616] and [RFC2818]) from a well-known URI
   [RFC5785].  (In this case, secure DNS is not necessary since the
   HTTPS retrieval mechanism relies on the chain of trust based on the
   public key infrastructure.)

   The process for retrieving a PKIX certificate over secure HTTP is as
   follows.

   1.  The TLS client performs an HTTPS GET at the source domain to the
       path "/.well-known/posh.{service}.{protocol}.json".  For example,
       if the application protocol is XMPP then the "{service}" is
       either "_xmpp-client" for XMPP client-to-server connections, and
       the "{protocol}" is "_tcp"; thus if an XMPP client were to use
       POSH to verify an XMPP server for the domain "im.example.com",
       the HTTPS GET request would be as follows:


   GET /.well-known/posh._xmpp-client._tcp.json HTTP/1.1
   Host: im.example.com


   2.  The source domain HTTPS server responds in one of three ways:

       *  If it possesses a PKIX certificate for the requested path, it
          responds as detailed in Section 3.1.

       *  If it has a reference to where the PKIX certificate can be
          obtained, it responds as detailed in Section 3.2.

       *  If it does not have any PKIX certificate for the requested
          path, it responds with a client error status code (e.g., 404).

3.1.  Source Domain Possesses PKIX Certificate

   If the source domain HTTPS server possesses the certificate
   information, it responds to the HTTPS GET with a success status code
   and the message body set to a JSON Web Key (JWK) set [JOSE-JWK].  The
   JWK set MUST contain at least one JWK with the following information:

   o  The "kty" field set to the appropriate key type (e.g., "RSA" for a
      certificate using an RSA key).

   o  The required fields for the key type (e.g., "n" and "e" for a
      certificate using an RSA key).

   o  The "x5c" field set to the certificate chain.

   Example Content Response

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/jwk-set+json
   Content-Length: 2785

   The TLS client uses the provided certificate to verify the TLS
   connection to the TLS server.  In order for the TLS client to verify
   the identity of the TLS server, it MUST ensure that the PKIX
   certificate presented by the TLS server during the TLS negotiation
   matches the certificate that it obtained via POSH.

   The TLS client MAY verify the certificate chain provided in the JWK,
   but it SHOULD consider the final issuer certificate to be a trust
   anchor for the purposes of this verification only.  Once it has
   verified the identity of the TLS server, the TLS client MUST NOT
   continue to treat this final issuer certificate as a trust anchor.

3.2.  Source Domain References PKIX Certificate

   If the source domain HTTPS server has a reference to the certificate
   information, it responds to the HTTPS GET with a redirect status code
   (e.g., 302, 303, 307, or 308), and includes a 'Location' header,
   which MUST specify an HTTPS URL.

   Example Redirect Response

   HTTP/1.1 302 Found
   Location: https://hosting.example.net/.well-known
             /posh._xmpp-client._tcp.json

   The client follows the redirect, the HTTPS server for the URI at
   which the client has been redirected responds to the request, and the
   client performs actions appropriate to the new response (whether it
   is a possession, a reference, or another redirect).

3.2.1.  Redirect Status Codes

   Care needs to be taken regarding the redirect mechanism is used for
   delegation.  Clients might remember the redirected location in place
   of the original, which can lead to verification mismatches when a
   source domain is migrated to a different delegated domain.

   To mitigate this concern, source domains SHOULD use only temporary
   redirect mechanisms, such as HTTP status codes 302 (Found) and 307
   (Temporary Redirect).  Clients MAY treat any redirect as temporary,
   ignoring the specific semantics for 301 (Moved Permanently) and 308
   (Permanent Redirect) [HTTP-STATUS-308].

3.2.2.  Redirect Depth

   To protect against circular references, clients MUST NOT follow an
   infinite number of redirects.  It is RECOMMENDED that clients follow
   no more than 10 redirects, although applications or implementations
   can require that fewer redirects be followed.

3.3.  Additional Security Mechanisms

   POSH can benefit from additional HTTPS security mechanisms, such as
   HTTP Strict Transport Security [RFC6797] and key pinning [KEYPIN],
   especially if the TLS client shares some information with a common
   HTTPS implementation (e.g., platform-default web browser).


4.  Secure Delegation

   The delegation from the source domain to the delegated domain can be
   considered secure if the certificate offered by the TLS server
   matches the POSH certificate, regardless of how the POSH certificates
   are obtained.


5.  Order of Operations

   POSH processes MUST be complete before the end of the TLS handshake
   for the application protocol, so that the TLS client can perform
   verification of reference identifiers.  Ideally a TLS client ought to
   perform the POSH processes in parallel with other application-level
   negotiation; this is sometimes called the "happy eyeballs" approach,
   similar to [RFC6555] for IPv4 and IPv6.  However, a TLS client might
   delay as much of the application-level negotiation in order to gather
   all of the POSH-based verification material.  For instance, a TLS
   client might not open the socket connection until it retrieves the
   PKIX certificates via POSH.

Internet-Draft                    POSH                         June 2013


6.  Caching Results

   Ideally, the TLS client relies on the expiration time of the
   certificate obtained via POSH, and not on HTTP caching mechanisms.
   To that end, the HTTPS servers for source and derived domains SHOULD
   specify a 'Cache-Control' header indicating a short duration (e.g.,
   max-age=60) or "no-cache" to indicate that the response (redirect or
   content) is not appropriate to cache at the HTTP level.


7.  Alternates and Roll-over

   To indicate alternate PKIX certificates (such as when an existing
   certificate will soon expire), the returned JWK set MAY contain
   multiple JWK objects.  The JWK set SHOULD be ordered with the most
   relevant certificate first as determined by the application service

Internet-Draft                    POSH                         June 2013


8.  Security Considerations

   This document supplements but does not supersede the security
   considerations provided in specifications for application protocols
   that decide to use POSH (e.g., [RFC6120] and [RFC6125] for XMPP).
   Specifically, communication via HTTPS depends on checking the
   identity of the HTTP server in accordance with [RFC2818].

   Additionally, the security of POSH can benefit from other HTTP
   hardening protocols, such as HSTS [RFC6797] and key pinning [KEYPIN].


9.  IANA Considerations

   Protocols that use POSH MUST register an appropriate well-known URI
   or URIs [RFC5785] with the IANA.  The IANA registration policy
   [RFC5226] is Specification Required.

   The following sections register two such URIs for XMPP.

9.1.  The "posh._xmpp-client._tcp.json" Well-Known URI

   This specification registers the "posh._xmpp-client._tcp.json" well-
   known URI in the Well-Known URI Registry as defined by [RFC5785].

   URI suffix: posh._xmpp-client._tcp.json

   Change controller: IETF

   Specification document(s): [[ this document ]]

9.2.  The "posh._xmpp-server._tcp.json" Well-Known URI

   This specification registers the "posh._xmpp-server._tcp.json" well-
   known URI in the Well-Known URI Registry as defined by [RFC5785].

   URI suffix: posh._xmpp-server._tcp.json

   Change controller: IETF

   Specification document(s): [[ this document ]]
