               Requirements for Fixed Mobile Convergence
                    draft-schott-fmc-requirements-02

Abstract

   Fixed-mobile convergence encompasses a variety of use cases that
   include situations in which a wireless device travels between a point
   of attachment in a mobile network (such as a cellular base station)
   and another point of attachment anchored in a fixed network such as a
   WiFi hotspot.  Convergence then means enabling an end-user to access
   services or retrieve content whatever the network access conditions
   (e.g., fixed or mobile access infrastructure), and whether the end-
   user is in motion or not.  This document discusses the issues related
   to convergence and elaborates a set of requirements.

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements                   July 2012


1.  Introduction

   With network heterogeneity and huge demand of multimedia and audio-
   visual services and applications as a given, users' satisfaction is
   the aim of each service provider to reduce churn, promote new
   services and improve the ARPU (Average Revenue per User).  The market
   is crowded.  Many players provide Internet and entertainment
   services, which motivates new business models considering users'
   experience and considering roaming agreement between different
   operators.  The new expectation for users' consumption style focuses
   on personalized and interactive usage.  This allows users on one hand
   to share content across many devices and with other users, but on the
   other hand to access all content seamlessly at the touch of a button.

   Consequently, Quality of Experience (QoE) has become a crucial
   determinant of the success or failure of the multimedia and audio-
   visual applications and services.  QoE evaluates the users' perceived
   quality for the provided services and hence reflects the users'
   satisfaction.  Regarding QoS, 3GPP has made architectural definitions
   as described in [TS23.203] and [TS29.212].  IETF has also described
   how QoS can be achieved over IP [RFC5865].

   Various meanings can be ascribed to the term Fixed-Mobile
   Convergence.  It is not the intention of this document to give a
   complete definition regarding business and technical aspects.  Fixed-
   mobile convergence has recently been used to include various use
   cases in which a wireless device travels between a point of
   attachment in a mobile network (such as a cellular base station) and
   another point of attachment anchored in a fixed network such as a
   WiFi hotspot.  Convergence refers to a perceived unification of the
   service level available to applications which is, to the extent
   feasible, independent of the nature of the underlying physical
   medium.

   This document discusses issues raised by convergence and elaborates a
   set of requirements based on the problem statement and use cases as
   discussed in [I-D.xue-intarea-fmc-ps] and [I-D.sun-fmc-use-case].
   These use cases have been under discussion in BBF [WT203] and 3GPP
   [cite].  The requirements discussed in this document are meant to
   help the IETF community to decide whether it should take part of the
   corresponding effort or not.


2.  Caution

   This document is a working tool to help assessing whether additional
   specification effort is required within IETF.  Technical issues
   mentioned in this document are those which may require carrying out a

   specification effort within IETF.

   The goal of this document to enable the analysis of technical issues
   and their requirements.  These issues are relevant to particular use
   cases.  The relevant use cases and associated requirements need
   thorough discussion.

   Some of these technical issues are already covered by some existing
   IETF WGs.  This document may provide motivation to advance such items
   in the standardization process.


3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as specified in [RFC2119].

   The following additional terms are used in this document.

   aggregation node
      The access network node which connects CPE and UE devices to the
      Internet.

   Codec
      Compression/Decompression of multimedia data using either a
      hardware device or software.

   CPE
      Customer Premises Equipment, that is equipment found in the
      customer's physical location and provided by the network operator
      or service providers.  DSL routers, Set-Top-Box (STB), and
      decoders are examples of CPE.

   FMC
      Fixed Mobile Convergence means enabling an end-user to access
      services or retrieve content whatever the network access
      conditions (e.g., fixed or mobile access infrastructure), and
      whether the end- user is in motion or not.  This includes also
      access conditions with this own service profile although having
      access by a 3rd party.

   host_id
      an identifier for the wireless device, as described in
      [I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis].

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements                   July 2012


   MN
      "Mobile Node"; a device that can move from one wireless point of
      attachment to another.  Other standard documents use different
      terminology for the same idea, for instance "UE" (for User
      Equipment), or AT (for Access Terminal).

   NFC Identifier
      Near Field Communications identifier.

   Port set
      a defined set of ports; in this document "port set" is used as an
      example of a host_id.  Each host under the same external IP
      address is assigned a restricted port set.  These port sets may
      then be advertised to remote servers.  Port sets assigned to hosts
      may be static or dynamic.

   SD
      Standard Definition for video using a standard resolution.

   HD
      High Definition for video using an enhanced resolution.


4.  Requirements for MN Identification behind a CPE with NAT

   A popular deployment model in fixed networks is to provide a host
   with a single private IPv4 address at the home or small business LAN.
   Then, each host within the local network will be assigned a private
   IPv4 address; a NA(P)T function [RFC2663] is responsible for
   translating the private IPv4 address to the public IPv4 address
   assigned to the CPE (Customer Premises Equipment).  Similar address
   translation features are also present now in mobile environment; as
   one example, CPE can be connected to mobile infrastructures.

   IP address sharing is motivated by a number of different factors.
   And today, some servers use the source IPv4 address as an identifier
   to treat some incoming connections differently.  Due to the use of
   NAT44 [RFC3022] and NAT64 [RFC6146]), that address will be shared.
   In particular, when a server receives packets from the same source
   address, because this address is shared, the server does not know
   which host is the sending host [RFC6269].  To be able to sort out the
   packets for each sending host, the server must have extra information
   in addition to the source IP address, to distinguish the sending
   host.  This identifying information is called the "host_id".

   As a general matter, the HOST_ID proposals do not seek to make hosts
   any more identifiable than they would be if they were using a public,
   non-shared IP address.  However, depending on the solution proposal,



Durel, et al.           Expires January 13, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements                   July 2012


   the addition of host_id information may allow a device to be
   fingerprinted more easily than it otherwise would be.  Should
   multiple solutions be combined that include different pieces of
   information in the host_id, fingerprinting may become even easier.

   A set of solution candidates to mitigate some of the issues
   encountered when address sharing is used have been described and
   compared in [I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis].  Among or aside
   this set of solutions, a mechanism will have to be recommended to
   supply host_id in the use cases described in Section 6 as well as in
   [I-D.xue-intarea-fmc-ps] and [I-D.sun-fmc-use-case].

   A CPE can also be configured to offer a shared WiFi to any visiting
   host (also called Mobile Node, or simply MN) which does not belong to
   the subscriber (owning the CPE).  A visiting MN uses that shared WiFi
   facility to access its services.  Granting access to the service is
   usually conditioned by an access control phase (e.g., redirection to
   captive portal inviting the user to authenticate).  Once access to
   the service is granted, the visiting MN can receive its services.
   Business model considerations for such service offerings are out of
   scope for this document.

   Among various ways to offer shared WiFi service, operators may elect
   to re-use the NAT function embedded in the CPE to route the traffic
   issued from the visiting MN.

   When the traffic of a visiting MN is multiplexed behind the same
   public IP address, upstream devices may be unable to distinguish the
   the traffic of the visiting MN from other traffic issued by devices
   belonging to the subscriber owning the CPE.  This traffic
   identification may be required to enforce dedicated policies (e.g.,
   Accounting, QoS policies, legal intercept, legal data storage, etc.).
   As a result, and in order for the operator to still support traffic
   management for this service, policy control/decision/enforcement MUST
   be based on the specific MN.  In other words, traffic belonging to a
   visiting MN MUST be explicitly identified.  The host_id jointly with
   the external IP address can be used for this purpose.

   As one example, port sets can be used as a host-id.  To illustrate,
   suppose the CPE assigns a private IPv4 address and a set of ports to
   a visiting MN.  Then, the CPE can report the assigned port set to a
   aggregation node together with other information such as external
   IPv4 address, MAC address, etc.  This information will be associated
   with the user-id provided during the authentication phase.  The CPE
   then uses that port set for translating packets to and from that
   visiting MN.  The set of ports (assigned by the CPE) and the external
   IP address (assigned to the CPE) are then sufficient to uniquely
   identify a MN.  The reporting phase can be avoided if the CPE is pre-

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements                   July 2012


   configured with a static list of port sets to be used for visiting
   MNs.

   The use of port sets and some other methods to explicitly identify a
   visiting MN is discussed in [I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis],
   but many other methods of identification are also possible.  In order
   to ease the selection of the appropriate host-id solution for the FMC
   case, below are listed a set of requirements to be met:

   o  All traffic MUST be identifiable (including TCP, UDP and ICMP)
   o  The MN SHOULD be authenticated if it injects its own host-id
   o  Otherwise, the CPE SHOULD inject the host-id
   o  The CPE SHOULD strip any existing host-id
   o  The CPE and the aggregation node MUST support at least one common
      method to convey host-id.

4.1.  Recommendations for MN Identification behind NAT

   We recommend dedicated efforts to specify a mechanism to supply
   host-id for MNs behind CPE and NAT.

   A solution analysis document for existing solution approaches would
   help.


5.  Requirements for Access Selection

   A multiple access environment requires appropriate choice of the
   access network (cellular, mobile, VPN,...) that the device is likely
   to be connected to.  This selection may depend on various criteria
   such as user's preference, user profile, network capabilities and
   conditions, operator policies, application QoS requirements and so
   on.  This access selection can happen when the wireless device is
   first connected to an access network, i.e. at bootstrapping phase,
   and when a new access network can be accessed to, for example as the
   device moves.

   Relevant information should be collected for each access network
   type, including:

   o  Available Bandwidth
   o  Cost
   o  Latency
   o  other QoS information
   o  Operator Network Identification
   o  Network Protocol Family (IPv4 or IPv6).

   Policy access SHOULD also be enabled.

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements                   July 2012


   A mapping between the network status and the service requirements
   should be specified to allow the MN to choose the network that best
   matches its service requirements.

   It should be possible to manage the user's access in the presence of
   several candidate access networks (fixed and mobile).


6.  Requirements for MN Mobility in Fixed Broadband Network

   The following are the requirements for MN Mobility in Fixed Broadband
   Network:
   o  Handover between networks while the session is active according to
      the network status with the change in the MN attachment.
   o  Mechanisms and interfaces between operators or/and access networks
      SHOULD be deployed to manage the mobility of the traffic flows of
      their users.
   o  Mobility should be enabled whether or not coverage areas overlap.
   o  Differentiated Services for the mobile device (MN)
   o  Service guarantee when device is roaming or mobile
   o  Resiliency in the network nodes should be provided


7.  Requirements for Streaming

   Additional IETF specification may be desirable for personalization of
   streaming services, especially video.

7.1.  Personalization of Video Streaming Service

7.1.1.  Discussion

   The proliferation of streaming services (e.g., video across multiple
   screens and connected devices) motivates video streaming service
   personalization -- especially for users desiring richer Quality of
   Experience (QoE).  Personalization of such services could allow
   streaming content delivery in a customized manner depending on each
   user, the device used, and the network status mainly through the
   following choices:

   i) delivery network (fixed or mobile),

   ii) local access network (WiFi, Femto, ADSL, .),

   iii) delivery mode (unicast, multicast, delivering content from the
   one server or from caches, ..)

   In this way, the streaming content could follow the user from place



Durel, et al.           Expires January 13, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements                   July 2012


   to place regardless of the access network type and of the mobile node
   (MN) characteristics.

   This requires technical solutions to allow the selection of the
   appropriate interface to be used by the MN.  The MN typically does
   not have any global view of the congestion status of the network.
   Moreover, in many cases the owner of the device might attempt to gain
   the highest level of service (regardless of the cost of network use
   by the operator).  Service levels need to be controlled by the
   network and/or the service domains, not the MN.  Likewise, the
   ability of premium clients to access more QoS resources (e.g. more
   bandwidth) further supports the design guideline enabling network
   choices to be decided by the operator.

   In many cases, the service level controls required by the network
   operator require traffic monitoring at the aggregation node.  This
   may require further coordination between the aggregation node and the
   CPE in order for the aggregation node to have the proper policy
   information available.

   To be able to select the appropriate network and adapt the content
   according to the network status there is a need to obtain information
   about the network status and its variation in a dynamic manner also
   during the session.  For example, a session that started with HD
   content could change to SD if the network conditions degrades.  The
   current adaptive streaming solutions (as the HAS: HTTP Adaptive
   Streaming) mainly count on the MN for selecting the suitable content.

   However, if content adaptation happens at the content source (in
   contrast to HTTP adaptive streaming techniques currently existing,
   the source would only send the appropriate content for each client
   and save network resources.  For example, H.264/AVC video is encoded
   into 2 Mbps for SD and 6Mbps for HD.  A mapping between the network
   status and the service requirements is also needed, where the service
   requirements are mainly exhibited by the content source (owned by the
   Content provider or the service provider).  Content adaptation
   directives could also be extracted from the content Metadata.

   Personalization of streaming imposes the following requirements:
   o  Each user connection MUST be identified through identifying each
      MN in a separate manner and distinguishing the MN and the CPE
      identification.  The MN identification could be simply an NFC
      identifier, MAC identifier, ... which is then administratively
      associated with more information reflecting the MN
      characteristics.
   o  Monitoring mechanisms MUST exist allowing the collection of QoS
      information for each access network type.

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements                   July 2012


   o  Service layer monitoring (for instance through MPEG2 layer monitor
      for video content) SHOULD exist to choose the network best
      matching the service requirements.
   o  The switch from one network to another MUST maintain the session
      according to the network status with the change in the MN
      attachment.
   o  Mechanisms and interfaces between operators SHOULD be deployed to
      control the mobility of traffic flows of their users.

7.2.  Recommendations for Streaming

   The IETF SHOULD dedicate efforts to consider several issues related
   to the MN and also to the network status as follows:

   1.  Each MN needs to be identified and the MN identity needs to be
       updated during the session each time a new terminal is used.  The
       characteristics of each MN being used needs to be known also
       (e.g. supported resolution, screen size, available network
       connectivity "WiFi, 3G, .." and the cost of using each type of
       available networks).
   2.  Information about is needed for each of the network parameters as
       detailed in Section 5,
   3.  A mapping between the network status and the service requirements
       needs to exist to enable selection of the network that best
       matches the service requirements.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document focuses on FMC requirements and the interworking of
   "WiFi, 3G, etc..." and should not give rise to any new security
   vulnerabilities beyond those described in IPSec [RFC4301], TLS
   [RFC5246] or SRTP [RFC3711].  Nevertheless an open network
   architecture aimed at fulfilling the requirements listed in this
   document may give rise to security issues not yet identified.


9.  IANA considerations

   None.

Appendix A.  Requirements for Content Adaptation

   In this case, adaptation of content format (HD/SD, codec, ...)
   SHOULD be possible when delivering the same content (e.g. video
   streaming) regardless of the access network type and of the mobile
   node (MN) characteristics.

A.1.  Recommendations for Content Adaptation

   To be able to meet above high level requirement, the content
   adaptation function needs to:

   1.  identify the user connection by identifying each MN in a separate
       manner.  The MN identity MUST be updated during the session each
       time a new terminal is used.  The characteristics of each MN
       being used needs to be known also (e.g. supported resolution,
       screen size, available network connectivity "WiFi, 3G, .." and
       the cost of using each type of available network).
   2.  distinguishing the MN and the CPE identification (MOTIVATION?).
   3.  rely on service layer monitoring (for instance through MPEG2
       layer monitor for video content) SHOULD exist to choose the
       network best matching the service requirements.
