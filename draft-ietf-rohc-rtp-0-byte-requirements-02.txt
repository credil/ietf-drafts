This document contains requirements for the 0-byte IP/UDP/RTP
(Internet Protocol/User Datagram Protocol/Real-Time Transport
Protocol) header compression scheme to be developed by the Robust
Header Compression (ROHC) Working Group.  It also includes the basic
assumptions for the typical link layers over which 0-byte compression
may be implemented, and assumptions about its usage in general.

This document is a product of the Robust Header Compression Working
Group of the IETF.
