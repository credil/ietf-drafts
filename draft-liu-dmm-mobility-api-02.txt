       Mobility API Extension for Distributed Mobility Management
                     draft-liu-dmm-mobility-api-02

Abstract

   In order to provide an appropriate level of mobility support that a
   mobile node may require for proper performance of various
   applications, it is important to enable applications to select
   addresses that will be managed properly by the mobility management
   infrastructure.  Previous documents have enabled address selection on
   the basis of certain characteristics such as randomness, temporary
   usage, scope of validity, and so on.  This document proposes new
   classes of addresses in addition to those already available, to
   enable an application to receive certain kinds of mobility support.

1.  Introduction

   An extension to the socket API (see [RFC5014]) has been specified to
   allow an application to identify its preference among multiple source
   addresses.  Furthermore, there are proposals
   ([I-D.draft-korhonen-6man-prfix-properties] and
   [I-D.draft-bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix-04]) to extend router
   advertisement to carry property and class information for the
   advertised prefixes.  Those proposals enable a mobile node to learn
   the property and class information for the prefix from the router
   advertisement message.  This document proposes an extension to
   [RFC5014] which would add more prefix classes so that an application
   could select prefixes with properties that are important for
   distributed mobility management.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Proposed Extension of RFC 5014

   A socket API extension defined in [RFC5014] is used for IPv6 source
   address selection.  An application can use this API to override the
   default source address selection mechanism for IPv6.  Currently, the
   following types of source address selection preference are defined in
   [RFC5014]:

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_HOME /* Prefer Home address as source */

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_COA /* Prefer Care-of address as source */

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP /* Prefer Temporary address as source */

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_PUBLIC /* Prefer Public address as source */

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_CGA /* Prefer CGA address as source */

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_NONCGA /* Prefer a non-CGA address as source */

   This document proposes the addition of two new flags:

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_LOCAL_HNP /* Prefer a local home prefix */

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_REMOTE_HNP /* Prefer a remote home prefix */

   The local home prefix may be preferred by applications which are
   likely to discontinue operations before the device travels to distant
   networks.  On the other hand, a remote home prefix may be more
   suitable for continued operation over wide areas, but at potentially
   increased cost for mobiilty management.

4.  Usage Example

   This section gives usage examples for the new flags API extension.

   Relevant distributed mobility management practices are discussed in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-dmm-best-practices-gap-analysis-01] and
   [I-D.draft-seite-dmm-dma-06].  The concept of dynamic anchoring
   concept is introduced, which means that the mobile node can have
   multiple mobility anchor points.  Then, the mobile node can select a
   locally allocated IP address for newly launched applications for
   optimized routing.  When the application continues communications
   while the mobile node moves to a new point of attachment, the mobile
   node can nevertheless stilluse the IP address allocated by previous
   anchor point for the on going communications.  When the application
   terminates, the mobile node will release the IP address allocated by
   the previous anchor point.

   In the dynamic anchoring scenario, the newly started application
   should use an IP address allocated by the local mobility anchor.  The
   application can use IPV6_PREFER_SRC_LOCAL_HNP flag to select the
   local allocated IP address.  For more long-lived communications, the
   application can use IPV6_PREFER_SRC_REMOTE_HNP flag to select the
   home address allocated by the previous mobility anchor to enable
   session continuity.
