INTERNET DRAFT         Tunnel Congestion Feedback          June 25, 2013


1. Introduction

   This document describes a mechanism for feedback of congestion
   observed in IP-in-IP tunnels (also referred to as IP tunnels).Common
   tunnel deployments such as mobile backhaul networks, VPNs and other
   IP-in-IP tunnels can be congested as a result of sustained high load.

   Network providers use a number of methods to deal with high load
   conditions including proper network dimensioning, policies for
   preferential flow treatment and selective offloading among others.
   The mechanism proposed in this draft is expected to complement them
   and provide congestion information that to allow making better,
   policies and decisions.

   The model and general solution proposed in chapters 4 consist of
   identifying congestion marks set in the tunnel segment, and feeding
   back the congestion signal from the egress to the ingress of the
   tunnel. Measuring congestion of a tunnel segment is based on counting
   outer packet CE marks for packets that have ECT marks in the inner
   packet. This proposal depends on statistical marking of congestion
   and uses the method described in RFC 6040, Appendix C. 

   Chapter 5 describes the protocol mechanisms to feed back the
   calculated congestion from egress to ingress. The desired properties
   of a protocol are outlined and IPFIX as a candidate protocol for
   these extensions is explored further.

3. Problem Statement

   IP backhaul networks such as those of mobile networks are provisioned
   and managed to provide the subscribed levels of end user service.
   These networks are traffic engineered, and have defined mechanisms
   for providing differentiated services and QoS per user or flow.
   Policy to configure per user flow attributes in these networks have
   traditionally been based on monitoring and static configuration. 

   Currently, these networks are increasingly used for applications that
   demand high bandwidth. The nature of the flows and length of end user
   sessions can lead to significant variability in aggregate bandwidth
   demands and latency. In such cases, it would be useful to have a more
   dynamic feedback of congestion information. This aggregate congestion
   feedback could be used to determine flow handling and admission
   control.

   Tunnels such as PMIP, GTP or other IP-in-IP maybe used to carry end
   user flows within the backhaul network such as shown in Figure 1. ECN
   handling mechanisms in RFC 6040 specifies how ECN should be handled
   for tunneling. In addition, RFC 6040, Appendix C provides guidance on
   how to calculate congestion experienced in the tunnel itself.
   However, there is no standardized mechanism by which the congestion
   information inside the tunnel can be fed back from egress to ingress

   router.

   In addition, it should be noted that these tunnels may carry ECT or
   Not-ECT traffic. A well defined mechanism for aggregate congestion
   calculation should be able to work in the presence of all kinds of
   traffic and would benefit from a common feedback mechanism and
   protocol.

4. Congestion Model

   To support traffic management and congestion feedback in tunnel,
   there are mainly two issues that this document discusses: calculation
   of congestion information in ECT and Not-ECT flows, and feeding back
   the congestion information from egress to ingress router.

4.1 Congestion Calculation

   Calculation of congestion in the tunnel is based on the method
   described in RFC 6040, Appendix C.

   The egress can calculate congestion using moving averages. The

   proportion of packets not marked in the inner header that have a CE
   marking in the outer header is considered to have experienced
   congestion in the tunnel. Note that the packets  are ECN capable and
   not congestion-marked before tunnel. Since routers implementing RED
   randomly select a percentage of packets to mark, this method can be
   effectively used to expose congestion in the tunnel. 


   When the ingress is  RFC6040 compliant, the packets collected by
   egress can be divided into to 4 categories, shown in figure 2. The
   tag before "|" stands for ECN field in outer  header; and the tag
   after "|" stands for ECN field in inner header.

   "Not-ECN|Not-ECN" indicates traffic that does not support ECN, for
   example UDP and Not-ECT marked TCP; "CE|CE" indicates  ECN capable
   packets that have CE-mark before entering the tunnel; "CE|ECT"
   indicates ECN capable packets that are CE-marked in the tunnel;
   "ECT|ECT" indicates ECN capable packets that have not experienced
   congested in tunnel (or outside the tunnel).


      +--------------------------+
      |     Not-ECN|Not-ECN      |
      +--------------------------+
      |          CE|CE           |
      +--------------------------+
      |          CE|ECT          |
      +--------------------------+
      |         ECT|ECT          |
      +--------------------------+

        Figure 2: ECN marking categories by outer/inner packet 


   Out of the total number of packets, if the quantity of CE|ECT packets
   is A, the quantity of ECT|ECT packets is B, then the congestion level
   (C) can be calculated as follows:

       			C=A/(A+B)

   As an example, consider 100 packets to calculate the moving average
   as shown in RFC 6040, Appendix C. Say that there are 12 packets that
   have CE|ECT marks indicating that they have experienced congestion in
   the tunnel. And, there are 58 packets that have ECT|ECT marks
   indicating that there was no congestion in either the tunnel or
   elsewhere. The egress can calculate congestions as:

   The basic model consists of the following components: Ingress,
   Egress, Feedback, Meter, Collector and Manager.

   At the egress, a module named Meter is used to estimate the
   congestion level of the tunnel as described in the section above.  A
   congestion information feedback module, called Feedback, is used to
   control the congestion information feedback.

   The metering module (Meter) in the Egress node accounts the
   congestion marks it receives. The Feedback module calculates the
   amount of congestion and feeds back the congestion information to the

   Ingress node. The Collector at the Ingress receives the congestion
   information which is fed back from the Egress node. The Manager has
   admission control and flow control functions which are out of the
   scope of this document. 

   It should be assumed that the ingress and egress of the tunnel are
   ECN-enabled and the intermediate routers in the tunnel path are also
   ECN-enabled. Congestion feedback signals in the figure are fed back
   using protocols described in section 5.

5. Congestion Feedback Protocol

5.1 Properties of Candidate Protocol

   To feedback congestion efficiently there are some properties that are
   desirable in the feedback protocol.

   1. Congestion friendliness. The feeding back traffics are coexistence
      with other traffics, so when congestion happens in the network,
      the feeding back traffic should be reduced, So that  feedback
      itself will not congest the network further when the network is
      already getting congested. In other words, feedback frequency
      should adjust to network's congestion level.

   2. Extensibility. The authors consider that using an existing
      protocol, or extensions to an existing protocol is preferable. The
      ability of a protocol to support modular extensions to report
      congestion level as feedback is a key attribute of the protocol
      under consideration.

   3. Compactness. In different situations, there may be different
      congestion information to be conveyed, and in order to reduce
      network load, the information to be conveyed should be selectable,
      i.e. only the required information should be possible to convey.



5.2 IPFIX Extensions for Congestion Feedback

   This section outlines IPFIX extensions for feedback of congestion.
   The authors consider that IPFIX is a suitable protocol that is
   reasonably easy to extend to carry tunnel congestion reporting.

   Since IPFIX uses TCP transport, it has the foundation for congestion-
   friendly behavior. When congestion occurs in the network, the
   Exporter (Egress) can reduce the IPFIX traffic. Thus the feedback
   itself will not congest the network further when the network is
   already getting congested. When the Exporter detects network
   congestion, it can also reduce IPFIX traffic frequency to avoid more
   congestion in network while being able to sufficiently convey
   congestion status.

   Because the template mechanism in IPFIX is flexible, it allows the
   export of only the required information. Sending only the required
   information can also reduce network load. 

   The basic procedure for feedback using IPFIX is as follows:
   (1)The exporter inform the collector how to interpret the IEs in

INTERNET DRAFT         Tunnel Congestion Feedback          June 25, 2013


      IPFIX message using template. Collector just accepts template
      passively; which IEs to send is configured by other means that not
      included in IPFIX specification.

   (2)The exporter meters the traffic and sends the congestion level to
      collector.


   Congestion feedback using IPFIX is shown in the figures below.  There
   are two variations to congestion feedback model using IPFIX. In the
   first one shown in Figure 4(a), congestion information is sent
   directly from egress to ingress and ingress makes decisions according
   this information. In the second case shown in Figure 4(b), congestion
   information is sent to a mediation controller instead of tunnel
   ingress; the controller is in charge of making decisions according to
   network congestion and control the behavior of ingress node, for
   example, reducing traffic or forbidding new traffic flows. In this
   model the congestion information from egress to controller is
   conveyed by IPFIX, but how controller controls the behavior of

   To support feeding back congestion information, some extensions to
   the IPFIX protocol are necessary. A new IE conveying congestion level
   is defined for this purpose.

      Definition of new IE indicating congestion level.
      Description:
         The congestion level calculated by exporter.
         Abstract Data Type: unsigned8
         Data Type Semantics: quantity

   The example below shows how IPFIX can be used for congestion feedback
   (note: the information conveyed here may be incomplete). 

   (1) Sending Template Set The exporter use Template Set to inform the
   collector how to interpret the IEs in the following Data Set.

      +------------------------+--------------------+
      |Set ID=2                |Length=n            |

        Figure 5: IPFIX Congestion Flow 

   The Exporter can send congestion information periodically or when
   triggerd to the Collector. Before sending congestion data to the
   collector, the exporter sends a Template set to Collector. The
   Template set specifies the structure and semantics of the subsequent
   Data Set containing congestion-related information. The Collector
   understands the Data Sets that follow according to Template Set that
   was sent previously. The exporting Process transmits the Template Set
   in advance of any Data Sets that use that Template ID, to help ensure
   that the Collector has the Template Record before receiving the first
   Data Record. Data Records that correspond to a Template Record may
   appear in the same and/or subsequent IPFIX Message(s).

   The Exporter meters the traffic passing through it and generates flow
   records. At this point, the Exporter may cache the records and then
   send congestion cumulative information to the collector. When
   Exporter detects that the network is heavily congested, it can change
   the feedback frequency to avoid adding more congestion to network.

   When receiving congestion related information, the Collector will
   make decisions to control the traffic entering the tunnel to reduce
   tunnel congestion.


5.3 Other Protocols

   A thorough evaluation of other protocols have not been performed at
   this time.

6. Security Considerations

   This document describes the tunnel congestion calculation and
   feedback. For feeding back congestion, security mechanisms of IPFIX
   are expected to be sufficient. No additional security concerns are
   expected.



7. IANA Considerations

   IANA assignment of parameters for IPFIX extension may need to be
   considered in this document.
