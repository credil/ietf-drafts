Internet-Draft             URI Scheme for TURN              October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Traversal Using Relays
   around NAT (TURN) protocol.

   The TURN protocol is a specification allowing hosts behind NAT to
   control the operation of a relay server.  The relay server allows
   hosts to exchange packets with its peers.  The peers themselves may
   also be behind NATs.  RFC 5766 [RFC5766] defines the specifics of the
   TURN protocol.

   The 'turn/turns' URI scheme is used to designate a TURN server (also
   known as a relay) on Internet hosts accessible using the TURN
   protocol.  With the advent of standards such as WEBRTC [WEBRTC], we
   anticipate a plethora of endpoints and web applications to be able to
   identify and communicate with such a TURN server to carry out the
   TURN protocol.  This also implies those endpoints and/or applications
   to be provisioned with appropriate configuration required to identify
   the TURN server.  Having an inconsistent syntax has its drawbacks and
   can result in non-interoperable solutions.  It can result in
   solutions that are ambiguous and have implementation limitations on
   the different aspects of the syntax and alike.  The 'turn/turns' URI
   scheme helps alleviate most of these issues by providing a consistent
   way to describe, configure and exchange the information identifying a
   TURN server.  This would also prevent the shortcomings inherent with
   encoding similar information in non-uniform syntaxes such as the ones
   proposed in the WEBRTC Standards [WEBRTC], for example.

   The 'turn/turns' URI scheme adheres to the generic syntax defined in
   RFC 3986 [RFC3986].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  URI Scheme Definition

3.1.  URI Scheme Syntax

   The 'turn' URI takes the following form (the syntax below is non-
   normative):

Internet-Draft             URI Scheme for TURN              October 2011


      turn:<userinfo>@<host>:<port>

      turns:<userinfo>@<host>:<port>

   Where <userinfo> with the "@" (at) sign character, as well as the
   <port> part and the preceding ":" (colon) character, is OPTIONAL.

   The normative syntax of the 'turn' URI is defined as shown in the
   following Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] rule:

   turn-uri      = turn-scheme ":" [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
   turn-scheme   = "turn"/"turns"
   userinfo      = user [ ":" password ]
   user          = 1*(%x21-24 / %x26-39 / %x3B-3F / %x41-7F
                   / escaped)
                       ; The symbols "%", ":", "@", and symbols
                       ; with a character value below 0x21 may
                       ; be represented as escaped sequences.
   password      = 1*(%x21-24 / %x26-3F / %x41-7F / escaped)
                       ; The symbols "%", "@", and symbols with
                       ; a character value below 0x21 may be
                       ; represented as escaped sequences.
   host          = hostname / IPv4address / IPv6reference
   hostname      = *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
   domainlabel   = alphanum / alphanum *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
   toplabel      = ALPHA / ALPHA *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
   IPv4address   = 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT
   IPv6reference = "[" IPv6address "]"
   IPv6address   = hexpart [ ":" IPv4address ]
   hexpart       = hexseq / hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] / "::" [ hexseq ]
   hexseq        = hex4 *( ":" hex4 )
   hex4          = 1*4HEXDIG
   port          = 1*DIGIT
   alphanum      = ALPHA / DIGIT
   escaped       = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG

   The current ABNF proposal doesn't specify a mechanism for handling
   different transports.  We have identified a possible solution and
   will be included in the future version of the draft.

   The <host>, <port> and <userinfo> rules are described in Appendix A
   of RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  The core rules <ALPHA>, <DIGIT> and
   <HEXDIGIT> are used as described in Appendix B of RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

3.2.  URI Scheme Semantics

   The TURN protocol supports sending messages over UDP, TCP or TLS-
   over-TCP.  The 'turns' URI scheme SHALL be used when TURN is run over



Nandakumar, et al.       Expires April 27, 2012                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             URI Scheme for TURN              October 2011


   TLS-over-TCP (or in the future DTLS-over-UDP) and the 'turn' scheme
   SHALL be used otherwise.  The <host> part of the 'turn' URI, which is
   REQUIRED, denotes the TURN server host.  The <userinfo> part,
   identifies the credential required for the long-term credential
   mechanism as described in the section 10.2 of RFC 5389 [RFC5389].
   The <port> part, if present, denotes the port on which the TURN
   server is awaiting connection requests.  If it is absent, the default
   port SHALL be 3478 for both UDP and TCP.  The default port for TURN
   over TLS SHALL be 5349.


4.  Examples

   URI to identify a long-term credential for the TLS-over-TCP
   connection to TURN server, example.com, on default port 5349:

      turns:username:password@example.com

   URI to identify a long-term credential for the connection to TURN
   server, example.com, on default port 3478:

      turn:username:password@example.com


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document instructs IANA to register the 'turn' and 'turns' URI
   schemes in the "Permanent URI Schemes" sub-registry in the "Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes" IANA registry [URIREG].  These
   registrations follows the URI Scheme Registration Template detailed
   in Section 5.4 of RFC 4395 [RFC4395].

5.1.  The 'turn' URI Scheme Registration

   IANA registration of the the 'turn' URI scheme:

      URI scheme name: turn

      Status: Permanent

6.  Security Considerations

   The URI Scheme defined by this document for the Traversal Using
   Relays around NAT (TURN) protocol needs to consider the security
   considerations detailed in Section 17 of RFC 5766 [RFC5766].

   As described in Section 3.2.1 of STD 66 [RFC3986], having
   authentication information (specifically passwords) in a URI means
   that the URI must be handled carefully:



Nandakumar, et al.       Expires April 27, 2012                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             URI Scheme for TURN              October 2011


      The passing of authentication information in clear text has proven
      to be a security risk in almost every case where it has been used.

   Section 3.2.1 contains advice on handling URI that contain passwords
   in the userinfo portion.  Implementations of this specification MUST
   implement that advice.

   Specifically if a URI that contains credentials leaks, then it would
   allow an attacker to use the TURN server which is referenced by the
   URI.  Such an attack has two major impacts.  First, it uses up the
   operator's bandwidth.  Second, if the operator bills the user for
   TURN server usage, then it may expose the user to costs incurred by
   the attacker.  However, the attacker never obtains the user's private
   information, nor does this attack allow for traffic amplification.

   The expected use environment mitigates to some degree concerns about
   TURN URIs compared to other URIs, such as HTTPS.  First, users do not
   dereference TURN URIs directly.  Instead, they are passed to the TURN
   stack.  Thus, concerns about confusion or leakage due to the URI
   being displayed to the user are significantly reduced; indeed the URI
   need never be available to the user at all.

   One of the primary use cases for a TURN URI with credentials is
   WebRTC.  In this case, a web server will be offering a calling
   service and may have an associated TURN server it can use.  In this
   case, the browser will need to use the TURN server and the browser
   has no long term or preexisting relationship with the TURN server.
   The web server needs to provide some credential to the client which
   it can use to access the TURN server.  Since TURN authentication is
   via username and password, this implies that the credential is a
   username/password pair.  While this must be transmitted securely
   (i.e., over HTTPS), the security properties are the same whether the
   password is carried separately or is part of the URL.  Moreover,
   because the web server and TURN servers can cooperate, a new password
   can be issued for every call, making short-term credentials feasible
   and thus significantly mitigating the risk.

   If a TURN URI is transferred between hosts, it MUST be done over a
   protocol that provides confidentiality such as HTTPS [RFC2818].  It
   is RECOMMENDED that the credential only be valid for a single call
   and preferably for no more than one day. that "preferably" is bad.

   We acknowledge the existence of
   draft-petithuguenin-behave-turn-uri-bis-04 document as a parallel
   effort in defining the URI scheme for TURN.  Awareness of this draft
   came late in the process and we have not had to time to reach out to
   the author of that memo and discuss opportunities to collaborate on a
   single document.  It is our intentions to do so.
