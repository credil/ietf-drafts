   Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) and Compressed Bundle Header
                    Encoding (CBHE) IANA Registries
                   draft-dtnrg-ltp-cbhe-registries-00

Abstract

   The DTNRG research group has defined the experimental Licklider
   Transmission Protocol (LTP) [RFC5326] and the Compressed Bundle
   Header Encoding (CBHE) [RFC6260] mechanism for the 'ipn' URI scheme.
   Both documents describe fields that are subject to a registry.  For
   the purpose of its research work, the group has created ad-hoc
   registries.  As the specifications are stable and have multiple
   interoperable implementations, the group would like to hand off the
   registries to IANA for official custody.  This document describes the
   actions needed to be executed by IANA.

Internet-Draft             LTP IANA Registries             November 2011


1.  Introduction

   The DTNRG research group has defined the Licklider Transmission
   Protocol (LTP)[RFC5326].  LTP contains certain fields that are
   subject to a registry.  For the purpose of its research work, the
   group has created ad-hoc registries.  As the specifications are
   stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the group
   would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official custody.
   This document describes the actions needed to be executed by IANA.

   The Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) [RFC6260] specification
   defines the concepts of Node Number and Service Number in the 'ipn'
   URI scheme.  In this document we request formation of an IANA
   registry for the Node Number field in the 'ipn' scheme.  There is a
   separate Internet Draft that will (if approved) establish a registry
   for the service-nbr portion and relate entries there to a
   corresponding registry for the 'dtn' URI scheme.

   Because of its association with space communication and the
   Consultative Committee on Space Data Systems [CCSDS], a portion of
   the CBHE Node Number space and a portion of the LTP Engine ID space
   is delegated by this document to the CCSDS Space Assigned Numbers
   Authority [SANA].  SANA functions similarly to IANA in that it
   maintains registries of managed values, with a focus on values used
   by protocols used by CCSDS member agencies.


2.  Licklider Transmission Protocol

   The Licklider Transmission Protocol has fields requiring registries
   managed by IANA.

2.1.  LTP Engine ID

   The Licklider Transmission Protocol has an LTP Engine ID field
   (section 2 of [RFC5326]).  An IANA registry shall be set up as
   follows.

   The registration policy for this registry is:

   0  Reserved

   1 -- (2**14)-1  Expert review required.  The designated experts for
      the review are the chairs of the IRTF DTN Research Group (dtnrg)
      if the dtnrg is extant, or as determined by the IRSG.

3.  Compressed Bundle Header Encoding

   The Compressed Bundle Header Encoding specification defines concepts
   of Node Number' and 'Service Number' that require registries managed
   by IANA.  This document addresses the 'Node Number' registry; a
   separate document addresses the formation and management of the
   'Service Number' registry.

3.1.  CBHE Node Numbers

   The Compressed Bundle Header Enoding specification defnes a Node
   Number (node-nbr) field (section 2.1 of [RFC6260]).  An IANA registry
   shall be set up as follows.

   The registration policy for this registry is:

   0  Reserved

   1 -- (2**14)-1  Expert review required.  The designated experts for
      the review are the chairs of the IRTF DTN Research Group (dtnrg)
      if the dtnrg is extant, or as determined by the IRSG.

   (2**14) -- (2**21)-1  Allocated to the Space Assigned Numbers
      Authority (SANA) for use by Consultative Committee for Space Data
      Systems (CCSDS) missions.

   The CBHE Node Number is expressed as a Self-Delimiting Numeric Value
   (SDNV) in the CBHE specification.  Allowable values for the Node
   Number range from 1 -- 2**64)-1.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document requests the creation of registries managed by IANA.
   Thera are no security issues involved.  Refer to the Security
   Considerations section of [RFC5326] for security issues with the LTP
   protocol.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create the registries as described in Sections 2
