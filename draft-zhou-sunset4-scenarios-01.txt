Abstract

   This document describes scenarios at subscriber, carrier and
   enterprise sites during IPv4 sunsetting.  In each site, there may be
   different requirements and issues.  The aim of this document is to
   put forward some issues in these scenarios and to identify whether
   further specifications are needed to solve these issues to facilitate
   IPv4 sunsetting.

Internet-Draft          IPv4 Sunsetting Scenarios              July 2012


1.  Introduction

   There are already a set of documents in IETF which to some extent
   facilitate IPv6 transition.  For example,
   [I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements] describes the common requirements
   of CGN (NAT44).  For devices which implement NAT, MIB module is
   introduced in [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-mib].  However, there are many
   scenarios and issues encountered at subscriber, carrier and
   enterprise sites, e.g., source trace, high availability, and ALG
   issues at carrier site scenario.  In this document, these scenarios
   will be proposed in detail and some issues in these scenarios will be
   discussed.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3.  Subscriber Site Scenario

   Some subscribers have the need to run some servers at home, for
   example, web server, webcam, FTP server, etc.  Sometimes when a
   subscriber equipment reboots it may be assigned a new IP address
   which is different from the previous one.  To accomadate this IP
   address change, DDNS is used.  If NAT is used in subscribe premise,
   static port-forwarding can be configured for a specific service so
   that DDNS can continue to work.  But if CGN is deployed in the
   operator's network, one CGN will serve a lot of users, static port-
   forwarding configuration will require a lot of operational work, and
   there will be IP address and port conflict if multiple subscribers
   require a same purlic IP address and / or port.  A traditional
   solution is to assign public IP address to scribers who needs to run
   a server at home, but this will also require extra operational work,
   make the network more complicated.  In such a case, a possible
   solution is that DDNS system works together with some dynamic NAT
   traversal technologies, e.g.  UPnP/PCP, or the CGN provide DDNS
   proxy.

4.  Carrier Site Scenario

   For carrier site case, we provide some scenarios and issues as below
   for the working group discussion.

4.1.  Traceback

   Before CGN is introduced, the servers use the source IPv4 address as
   an identifier to treat incoming packets differently.  When the

   address sharing scheme is proposed, the server could not identify
   which host sends the packet because the packets are from the same
   source address.  [I-D.boucadair-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis] proposed
   solutions to identify each host sharing the same IP address with a
   unique host identifier.  But there are at least two issues existing
   in the traceback solutions: logging architecture and port allocation
   algorithm.

   As described in section 4 of [I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements], the
   destination addresses or ports should not be logged in CGN in order
   to reduce the logs in CGN.  [RFC6302]provides recommendations for
   Internet-facing servers logging incoming connections.  But it does
   not provide any recommendations about logging on carrier-grade NAT.
   So, a logging architecture in CGN to maintain records of the relation
   between a customer's identity and IP/port resources is needed.

   [RFC6431] provides port set options for port range allocation:
   contiguous, non-contiguous and random.  In the random-based solution,
   the algorithm should be reversible in order to trace the host.  But
   this may bring some security problems.

4.2.  Stateless CGN

   Carrier-grade NAT44 is one of the solutions to deal with the IPv4
   address shortage problem.  But the current NAT44 CGN(Carrier-grade
   NAT) is stateful and TCP/UDP session based, which makes the CGN
   complex.  There have been a number of efforts at IETF moving the NAT
   function from a stateful carrier grade NAT to the CPEs by allocating
   port sets to each customer, e.g., MAP/4RD-U, LAFT6, and etc.  There
   is also a requirement for NAT44 CGN to become completely stateless.

4.3.  High Availability

   In most ISP networks, one CGN device may serve large number of
   customers.  For stateful NAT, if there is a single point of failure
   in the CGN, the service may be interrupted or degraded.  Therefore,
   redundancy capabilities (including hot and cold standby) of the CGN
   devices are strongly needed to deliver highly available services to
   customers.  [I-D.xu-behave-stateful-nat-standby] may be a possible
   way to solve this problem.  In addition, pre-configuring a pool of
   public IPv4 addresses to the CGN device when it is in failure may
   also be a candidate solution.

4.4.  ALG

   Carrier-grade NAT44 performs NAT-44 and inherits the limitations of
   NAT.  Some protocols require ALGs in the CGN to traverse through the
   NAT, e.g., FTP, RTP.  However, in most ISP's network, CGN is a shared

Internet-Draft          IPv4 Sunsetting Scenarios              July 2012


   network device which needs to support a large number of sessions.  It
   is a huge work load for CGN to implement every ALGs, which will
   obviously bring bad performance for CGN.  How to make CGN more
   efficiency under the pressure of ALG becomes an issue.  One possible
   solution is to let the CPE or host implement ALG instead of CGN, or a
   flexible way to make ALG at either CPE or CGN is needed.

5.  Enterprise Site Scenario

   NAT is a basic feature of enterprise network.  The firewall/NAT
   device is deployed at the entrance of the enterprise network,
   following by the web server and the terminal.  Part of the web
   servers are required to open publically to provide one domian name
   and corresponding IP address (Two ways: the enterprise has its own
   DNS server; the enterprise has no DNS server and needs to publicize
   one public address).  NAT device is required to support this specific
   case.  In addition, the terminal or the web server following NAT
   device need to access Internet.  There are requirements for the
   enterprise users to record the NAT translation information.

   Some basic requirements of NAT device are also valid in enterprise
   scenarios, e.g., NAT traceback, port range allocation and NAT
   standby.  NAT device needs to record the NAT translation log in
   traceback solutions.  NAT server is required to support port range
   allocation.  Two NAT devices should store the information of each
   other to guarantee normal operation when one device is in failure in
   enterprise scenarios.

6.  IANA Considerations
