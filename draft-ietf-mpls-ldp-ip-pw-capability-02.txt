Abstract 

   Currently, no LDP capability is exchanged for LDP applications like 
   IP label switching and L2VPN P2P PW signaling. When an LDP session 
   comes up, an LDP speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state 
   for such LDP applications even when the peer session may be 
   established for some other applications like ICCP. This document 
   proposes a solution by which an LDP speaker announces its disinterest 
   in such non-negotiated application. This, in turn, disables the 
   advertisement of corresponding application state, which would have 
   otherwise be advertised by default, over the established LDP session.

Internet-Draft Disabling IPoMPLS and P2P PW LDP Applications August 2012 
      

1. Introduction 

  LDP Capabilities [RFC5561] introduced a mechanism to negotiate LDP 
  capabilities for a given feature amongst peer LSRs. The capability 
  mechanism insures that no unnecessary state is exchanged between peer 
  LSRs unless corresponding feature capability is successfully 
  negotiated between peers.  
   
  While new LDP features and applications, such as Typed Wildcard FEC 
  [RFC5918], Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol [ICCP], mLDP 
  [RFC6388], and P2MP PW [P2MP-PW] make use of LDP capabilities 
  framework for their feature negotiation, the earlier LDP features and 
  applications like IP label switching and L2VPN P2P PW signaling 
  [RFC4447] [RFC4762] may cause unnecessary state exchange between LDP 
  peers even when the given application is not enabled on one of the 
  LDP speakers participating in a given session.  
   
  For example, when bringing up and using an LDP peer session with a 
  remote PE LSR for purely ICCP signaling purposes, the LDP speaker may 
  unnecessarily advertise labels for IP (unicast) prefixes to this ICCP 
  related LDP peer as per its default behavior.  
   
  Another example of unnecessary state advertisement can be cited when 
  LDP is used in an IP dual-stack environment. For instance, an LSR 
  that is locally enabled for both IPv4 and IPv6 label switching may 
  advertise address/label bindings for both IPv4 and IPv6 address 
  families towards an LDP peer that is interested in IPv4 only. In this 
  case, the advertisement of IPv6 addresses and IPv4 prefix labels to 
  the peer is unnecessary, as well as wasteful from LSR memory/CPU and 
  network resource consumption point of view.  
   
  To avoid this unnecessary state advertisement and exchange, currently 
  an operator is typically required to configure and define some sort 
  of filtering policies on the box for LDP state exchange, which 
  introduces operational overhead and complexity.  
   
  This document proposes an LDP Capabilities [RFC5561] based solution 
  by which an LDP speaker may announce its disinterest (or non-
  support/disability) to its peer for IP Label Switching and/or L2VPN 
  P2P PW Signaling application at the time of session establishment. 
  This helps avoiding unnecessary state exchange for such feature

  applications. The proposal also states the mechanics to disable or 
  enable an application dynamically during the session lifetime. The 
  document introduces a new LDP capability to implement this proposal.  
   
2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].  

   The term "IP" in this document refers to both "IPv4 unicast" and 
   "IPv6 unicast" address families. 

   This document uses shorthand terms "IPoMPLS" to refer to IP Label 
   switching application, and "P2P PW" to refer to L2VPN PW signaling 
   for FEC 128 and FEC 129 P2P PWs.  

3. Non-negotiated LDP applications 

   For the applications that existed before LDP Capabilities [RFC5561] 
   procedures were defined, an LDP speaker typically advertises relevant 
   application state to its peers after session establishment without 
   waiting for any capabilities exchange and negotiation. These LDP 
   applications are: 

   o  IPv4/IPv6 label switching ("IPoMPLS") 

   o  L2VPN P2P PW signaling ("P2P PW") 

   To disable unnecessary state exchange for such LDP applications, a 
   new capability is being introduced in this document. This new 
   capability controls the advertisement of application state and 
   enables an LDP speaker to notify its LDP peer its disinterest in one 
   or more of these "Non-negotiated" LDP applications at the time of 
   session establishment. Upon receipt of such capability, the receiving 
   LDP speaker, if supporting the capability, MUST disable the 
   advertisement of any state related to the application towards the 
   sender. Moreover, the sender LSR SHOULD also disable the 
   advertisement of corresponding application state towards the peer. 
   This new capability can also be sent later in a Capability message to 
   either disable these applications, or to enable previously disabled 
   applications dynamically.

4. Controlling State Exchange for Non-negotiated LDP Applications 

   To control advertisement of state related to non-negotiated LDP 
   applications, namely IPoMPLS and P2P PW signaling, a new capability 
   TLVs is defined as follows. 

4.1. Application Control Capability 

   The "Application Control Capability" is a new Capability Parameter 
   TLV defined in accordance with section 3 of LDP Capabilities 
   specification [RFC5561]. The format of this new TLV is as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |S|  Reserved   |                                               | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                                                               | 
   ~               Application Control Element(s)                  ~  
   |                                                               | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
      Figure 1: Format of an "Application Control Capability" TLV 
    
   The value of the U-bit for the TLV MUST be set to 1 so that a 
   receiver MUST silently ignore this TLV if unknown to it, and continue 
   processing the rest of the message. Whereas, The value of F-bit MUST 
   be set to 0. Once advertised, this capability cannot be withdrawn and 
   hence the S-bit MUST be set to 1 both in Initialization message and 
   Capability message.  
    
   The capability data associated with this TLV is one or more 
   Application Control Elements, where each element defines 
   enabling/disabling of state advertisement for a given application. 
   The format of an Application Control Element is defined as follows: 
    
    0                   1

  Where: 
    
  App: Defines the (non-negotiated) application type. The value of this 
    field is defined as:  
       0: IPv4 Label switching 
       1: IPv6 Label switching 
       2: P2P PW FEC128 signaling 
       3: P2P PW FEC129 signaling 
    4-15: Reserved. 
    
   D bit: Controls the advertisement of state for the application as 
    follows 
       1: Disable state advertisement 
       0: Enable state advertisement 
    
   Rsvd1, Rsvd2: Reserved for future use. MBZ on transmit and ignored on 
    receipt. 
 
   The "Length" field of "Application Control Capability" TLV depends on 
   the number of Application Control Elements present in the TLV. For 
   example, if there are two elements present, then the Length field is 
   set to 5 octets. A receiver of this capability TLV can deduce number 
   of application control elements present in the TLV by using Length 
   field.  
    
   For now onward, this document uses term "element" to refer to an 
   application control element. 
     
   As described earlier, "Application Control Capability" TLV MAY be 
   included by an LDP speaker in an Initialization message to signal to 
   its peer LSR that state exchange for one or more application(s) need 
   to be disabled on a given peer session. This TLV can also be sent 
   later in a Capability message to selectively enable or disable these 
   applications. An "Application Control Capability" TLV MUST contain 
   elements with distinct application types and the TLV MUST NOT contain 
   the same application type more than once. 

   To control more than one application, a sender LSR can either send a 
   single capability TLV in a message with multiple elements present, or 
   can send separate messages with capability TLV specifying one or more 
   elements. A receiving LSR, however, MUST treat each incoming message 
   with capability TLV as an incremental update to the existing control.  

   To understand capability updates from an example, let us consider 2 
   LSR peers, R1 (sender) and R2 (receiver), both of which support all 
   the non-negotiated applications listed earlier. By default, these LSR 
   will advertise state for these applications to their peer as soon as 
 
 
Raza, et. al            Expires February 2013                  [Page 6] 
         
     
Internet-Draft Disabling IPoMPLS and P2P PW LDP Applications August 2012 
      

   an LDP session is established. Now assume that R2 receives an 
   Application Control capability in the Initialization message with 
   "IPv6 Label switching" and "P2P PW FEC129" applications disabled. 
   This updates R2's outbound policy towards R1 to advertise state 
   related to only "IPv4 Label switching" and "P2P PW FEC 128" 
   applications.  Now, R2 receives a capability update from R1 via a 
   Capability message with "IPv6 Label switching" enabled and "P2P PW 
   FEC128" disabled. This updates R2's outbound policy towards R1 to 
   advertise both IPv4 and IPv6 Label switching state, and disable both 
   P2P PW FEC128 and FEC 129 signaling. Finally, R2 receives another 
   update from R1 via Capability message that specifies to disable all 4 
   non-negotiated applications, resulting R2 outbound policy towards R1 
   to block/disable state for all these applications, and only advertise 
   state for any other application, if present. 

5. Capabilities Procedures 

   The "Application Control" capability conveys the desire of a sending 
   LSR to disable receipt of unwanted/unnecessary state from a peer. 
   Hence, this capability is unilateral and uni-directional in nature, 
   and a receiving LSR is not required to send a similar capability TLV 
   in an Initialization or Capability message towards the sender. This 
   unilateral behavior also conforms to the procedures defined in the 
   Section 6 of LDP Capabilities [RFC5561]. 

   After this capability is successfully negotiated (i.e. sent by a 
   sender and received/understood by the receiver), then both 
   participating LSRs MUST NOT exchange any state related to the 
   disabled applications until and unless these applications are 
   explicitly enabled again via a capability update. 

   If a receiving LDP speaker does not understand the Application 
   Control capability TLV, then it MUST respond to the sender with 
   "Unsupported TLV" Notification as described in LDP Capabilities 
   [RFC5561]. Upon receipt of such Notification, the sender MAY still 
   continue to block/disable its outbound state advertisement towards 
   the peer for the requested disabled applications. If a receiving LDP 
   speaker does not understand or does not support an application 
   specified in an application control element, it SHOULD silently 
   ignore/skip such an element and continue processing rest of the TLV. 

5.1. Application Control Capability in an Initialization message 

   LDP Capabilities [RFC5561] dictate that the S-bit of capability 
   parameter in an Initialization message MUST be set to 1 and SHOULD be 
   ignored on receipt.   

 
 
Raza, et. al            Expires February 2013                  [Page 7] 
         

Internet-Draft Disabling IPoMPLS and P2P PW LDP Applications August 2012 
      

   An LDP speaker determines (e.g. via some local configuration or 
   default policy) if they need to disable IPoMPLS and/or P2P PW 
   applications with a peer LSR. If there is a need to disable, then the 
   "Application Control Capability" TLV needs to be included in the 
   Initialization message with respective application control elements 
   included with their D bit set to 1.   

   An LDP speaker that supports the "Application Control" capability 
   MUST interpret the capability TLV in a received Initialization 
   message such that it disables the advertisement of the application 
   state towards the sender LSR for IPoMPLS and/or P2P PW applications 
   if their application control element's D bit is set to 1.  

5.2. Application Control capability in a Capability message 

   If the LDP peer supports "Dynamic Announcement Capability" [RFC5561], 
   then an LDP speaker may send Application Control capability in a 
   Capability message towards the peer. Once advertised, these 
   capabilities cannot be withdrawn and hence the S-bit of the TLV MUST 
   be set to 1 when sent in a Capability message.  

   An LDP speaker may decide to send this TLV towards an LDP peer if any 
   of its IPoMPLS and/or P2P PW signaling applications get disabled, or 
   if previously disabled application gets enabled again. In this case, 
   LDP speaker constructs the TLV with appropriate application control 
   elements and sends the corresponding capability TLV in a Capability 
   message. Furthermore, the LDP speaker also withdraws/advertises 
   application(s) related state (such as address/label bindings) from/to 
   its peer according to the capability update. 

   Upon receipt of this TLV in a Capability message, the receiving LDP 
   speaker reacts in the same manner as it reacts upon the receipt of 
   this TLV in an Initialization message. Additionally, the receiving 
   LDP speaker withdraws/advertises application state from/to the 
   sending peer according to the capability update.  

6. Operational Examples 

6.1. Disabling IPoMPLS and P2P PW applications on an ICCP session 

   Consider two PE routers, LSR1 and LSR2, which understand/support 
   "Application Control" capability TLV, and have an established LDP 
   session due to ICCP application in order to exchange ICCP state 
   related to dual-homed devices connected to these LSRs. Let us assume 
   that LSR1 is provisioned not to exchange any state for IPoMPLS 
   (IPv4/IPv6) and P2P PW (FEC128/129) application with LSR2. 

 
 
Raza, et. al            Expires February 2013                  [Page 8] 
         
     
Internet-Draft Disabling IPoMPLS and P2P PW LDP Applications August 2012 
      

   To indicate its disinterest in these applications, the LSR1 will 
   include an "Application Control" capability TLV (with 4 application 
   control elements corresponding to these 4 applications with D bit 
   set to 1 for each one) in the Initialization message. Upon receipt 
   of this TLV in Initialization message, the LSR2 will disable 
   advertisement of IPv4/IPv6 bindings (addresses and labels), as well 
   as P2P PW FEC128/129 signaling, towards LSR1 after session 
   establishment.  

   The LSR1 will also disable similar state advertisement for these 
   applications towards LSR2 independently, irrespective of the fact 
   whether or not LSR2 could disable the corresponding application 
   state advertisement towards LSR1. 

6.2. Disabling IPoMPLS application on a L2VPN/PW T-LDP session 

   Now, consider LSR1 and LSR2 have an established T-LDP session for 
   P2P PW application just to exchange label bindings for FEC 128/129. 
   Since in most typical deployments, there is no need to exchange IP 
   (v4/v6) address/label bindings amongst the PE LSRs, let us assume 
   that LSR1 is provisioned to disable IPoMPLS (IPv4/IPv6)application 
   on given PW session towards LSR2.  

   To indicate its disinterest in IPoMPLS application over PW T-LDP 
   session, the LSR1 will follow/apply the same procedures to disable 
   IPv4 and IPv6 label switching as described in previous section. 
   Similarly, LSR2 will behave accordingly by disabling state 
   advertisement for IPoMPLS application towards LSR1. 

6.3. Disabling IPoMPLS application dynamically on an established IP/PW 
   session 

   Assume that LSRs from previous sections were initially provisioned to 
   exchange both IPoMPLS and P2P PW state over the session between them, 
   and also support "Dynamic Announcement" Capability [RFC5561]. Now, 
   assume that LSR1 is dynamically provisioned to disable IPoMPLS 
   (IPv4/IPv6) over T-LDP session with LSR2. In this case, LSR1 will 
   first disable its future outbound application state towards LSR2, and 
   also withdraw all its previously advertised IPoMPLS state (labels and 
   addresses) by sending a single Prefix FEC Typed Wildcard Label 
   Withdraw message [RFC5918], and an Address Withdraw message 
   respectively towards LSR2. LSR1 will also send Application Control 
   capability TLV in a Capability message towards LSR2 with application 
   control elements defined for IPv4 and IPv6 label switching with D bit 
   set to 1. Upon receipt of this TLV, LSR2 will also disable IPoMPLS 
   applications towards LSR1 and withdraw all previous IP label/address 
   state using the same mechanics as described earlier for LSR1. This

Internet-Draft Disabling IPoMPLS and P2P PW LDP Applications August 2012 
      

   dynamic disability of IPoMPLS application will not impact L2VPN P2P 
   PW application on the given session, and both LSRs should continue to 
   exchange PW Signaling application related state. 

6.4. Disabling unwanted state advertisement by an IP dual-stack LSR 

   In IP dual-stack scenarios, an LSR2 may advertise unnecessary state 
   (label/address bindings) towards peer LSR1 corresponding to IPv6 
   label switching application once a session is established mainly for 
   exchanging state for IPv4. The similar scenario also applies when 
   advertising IPv4 label switching state on a session meant for IPv6. 
   The Application Control capability and its procedures defined in this 
   document can help to avoid such unnecessary state advertisement. 

   Consider IP dual-stack environment where LSR2 is enabled for IPoMPLS 
   application for both IPv4 and IPv6, but LSR1 is enabled for (or 
   interested in) only IPv4oMPLS. To avoid receiving unwanted state 
   advertisement for IPv6oMPLS application from LSR2, LSR1 can send 
   "Application Control" capability with element for IPv6 label 
   switching with D bit set to 1 in the Initialization message towards 
   LSR2 at the time of session establishment. Upon receipt of this 
   capability, LSR2 will disable all IPv6 label and address binding 
   advertisement towards LSR1. If IPv6oMPLS is later enabled on LSR1, 
   LSR1 can update the capability by sending Application Control 
   capability in Capability message towards LSR2 to enable IPv6oMPLS 
   application dynamically. 

   [LDPv6] specification section 7 also suggests an alternate way to 
   avoid the unnecessary state advertisement in the above scenario.  

7. Security Considerations 

  The proposal introduced in this document does not introduce any new 
  security considerations beyond that already apply to the base LDP 
  specification [RFC5036] and [RFC5920]. 
   
8. IANA Considerations 

  The document defines following a new capability parameter TLV and 
  requests following LDP TLV code point assignment by IANA from LDP 
  "TLV Type Name Space" registry: 
   
   o  "Application Control Capability" TLV (requested codepoint: 0x50C)

9. Conclusions 

   The document proposed a solution using LDP Capabilities [RFC5561] 
   mechanics to disable unnecessary state exchange, if/as desired, 
   between LDP peers for currently non-negotiated IP/PW LDP 
   applications.
