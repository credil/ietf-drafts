Abstract

   This document updates RFC 5066.  It amends that specification by
   informing the internet community about the transition of the EFM-CU-
   MIB module from the concluded IETF Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB
   Working Group to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
   Engineers (IEEE) 802.3 working group.

Internet-Draft            EFMCu Interfaces MIB             November 2013


1.  Introduction

   RFC 5066 [RFC5066] defines two MIB modules:

      EFM-CU-MIB, with a set of objects for managing 10PASS-TS and
      2BASE-TL Ethernet in the First Mile Copper (EFMCu) interfaces;

      IF-CAP-STACK-MIB, with a set of objects describing cross-connect
      capability of a managed device with multi-layer (stacked)
      interfaces, extending the stack management objects in the
      Interfaces Group MIB and the Inverted Stack Table MIB modules.

   With the conclusion of the [HUBMIB] working group, the responsibility
   for the maintenance and further development of a MIB module for
   managing 2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS interfaces, has been transfered to
   the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.3
   [802.3] working group.  In 2011, the IEEE developed IEEE8023-EFM-CU-
   MIB module, based on the original EFM-CU-MIB module.  The current
   revision of IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB is defined in IEEE Std 802.3.1-2013
   [802.3.1].

   The IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB and EFM-CU-MIB MIB modules can coexist.

   Please note that IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module was not transfered to IEEE
   and remains as defined in RFC 5066.  This memo provides an updated
   security considerations section for that module, since the original
   RFC did not list any security consideration for IF-CAP-STACK-MIB.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Mapping between EFM-CU-MIB and IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB

   The current version of IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB, defined in IEEE Std
   802.3.1-2013, has MODULE-IDENTITY of ieee8023efmCuMIB with an object
   identifier allocated under the { org ieee standards-association-
   numbers-series-standards lan-man-stds ieee802dot3 ieee802dot3dot1mibs
   } sub-tree.

   The EFM-CU-MIB has MODULE-IDENTITY of efmCuMIB with an object

   identifier allocated under the mib-2 sub-tree.

   The names of the objects in the first version of the IEEE8023-EFM-CU-
   MIB are identical to those in the EFM-CU-MIB.  However, since both
   MIB modules have different OID values, they can coexist, allowing the
   management of the newer IEEE MIB-based devices, alongside the legacy
   IETF MIB-based devices.

4.  Updating the MIB Modules

   With the transfer of the responsibility for maintenance and further
   development of the EFM-CU-MIB module to the IEEE 802.3 working group,
   the EFM-CU-MIB defined in RFC 5066 becomes the last version of that
   MIB module.

   All further development of the EFM Copper Interfaces MIB will be done
   by the IEEE 802.3 working group in the IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB module.
   Requests and comments pertaining to EFM Copper Interfaces MIB SHOULD
   be sent to the IEEE 803.3 working group.  Currently, the mailing list
   of the IEEE 802.3.1 task force, chartered with MIB development, is
   [stds-802-3-mib@listserv.ieee.org].

   The IF-CAP-STACK-MIB remains under IETF control and is currently
   maintained by the [OPSAWG] working group.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no managed objects defined in IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module with
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments since they can reveal some
   configuration aspects of the network interfaces.

   In particular, ifCapStackStatus and ifInvCapStackStatus can identify
   cross-connect capability of multi-layer (stacked) network interfaces,
   potentially revealing the underlying hardware architecture of the
   managed device.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this

   MIB module.

   Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), including full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   No action is required from IANA.
