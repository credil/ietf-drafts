     Abstract 

     There are many scenarios in which Traffic Engineering (TE) metrics 
     such as cost, latency and latency variation associated with a 
     Forwarding Adjacency (FA) or Routing Adjacency (RA) Label Switched 
     Path (LSP) are not available to the ingress and egress nodes. This 
     draft provides extensions for the Resource ReserVation Protocol-
     Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for the support of the discovery of 
     cost, latency and latency variation of an LSP.

     1. Introduction 

        There are many scenarios in packet and optical networks where 
        the route information of an LSP may not be provided to the 
        ingress node for confidentiality reasons and/ or the ingress 
        node may not run the same routing instance as the intermediate 
        nodes traversed by the path. In such scenarios, the ingress node 
        cannot determine the cost, latency and latency variation 
        properties of the LSP's route. Similarly, in Generalized Multi-
        Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks signaling 
        bidirectional LSP, the egress node cannot determine the cost, 
        latency and latency variation properties of the LSP route.  A 
        multi-domain or multi-layer network is an example of such 
        networks. Similarly, a GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) 
        [RFC4208] is also an example of such networks.  

        In certain networks, such as financial information networks, 
        network performance information (e.g. latency, latency 
        variation) is becoming as critical to data path selection as 
        other metrics [DRAFT-OSPF-TE-METRIC], [DRAFT-ISIS-TE-METRIC]. If 
        cost, latency or latency variation associated with an FA or an 
        RA LSP is not available to the ingress or egress node, it cannot 
        be advertised as an attribute of the FA or RA. One possible way 
        to address this issue is to configure cost, latency and latency 
        variation values manually. However, in the event of an LSP being 
        rerouted (e.g. due to re-optimization), such configuration 
        information may become invalid. Consequently, in case where that 
        an LSP is advertised as a TE-Link, the ingress and/ or egress 
        nodes cannot provide the correct latency, latency variation and 
        cost attribute associated with the TE-Link automatically.  

        In summary, there is a requirement for the ingress and egress 
        nodes to learn the cost, latency and latency variation 
        attributes of an FA or RA LSP. This draft provides extensions to 
        the Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) 
        for the support of the automatic discovery of these attributes.   

     2. RSVP-TE Requirement  

        This section outlines RSVP-TE requirements for the support of 
        the automatic discovery of cost, latency and latency variation 
        attributes of an LSP. These requirements are very similar to the 
        requirement of discovering the Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs)

     Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-ccamp-te-metric-recording-00.txt 
      
        associated with the route taken by an LSP [DRAFT-SRLG-
        RECORDING].  

     2.1. Cost, Latency and Latency Variation Collection Indication 

           The ingress and egress nodes of the LSP must be capable of 
        indicating whether the cost, latency and latency variation 
        attributes of the LSP should be collected during the signaling 
        procedure of setting up the LSP. No cost, latency or latency 
        variation information is collected without an explicit request 
        being made by the ingress node. 

     2.2. Cost, Latency and Latency Variation Collection 

           If requested, cost, latency and latency variation is 
        collected during the setup of an LSP. The endpoints of the LSP 
        may use the collected information and use it for routing, 
        flooding and TE link configuration purposes. 

     2.3. Cost, Latency and Latency Variation Update 

           When the cost, latency and latency variation property of a TE 
        link along the route of a LSP for which that property was 
        collected changes, e.g., if the administrator changes cost of a 
        TE link, the node where the change occurred needs to be capable 
        of updating the cost, latency and latency variation information 
        of the path and signaling this to the end-points. Similarly, if 
        a path segment of the LSP is rerouted, the endpoints of the re-
        routed segment need to be capable of updating the cost, latency 
        and latency variation information of the path. Any node which 
        adds cost, latency or latency variation information to an LSP 
        during initial setup must signal changes to these values to both 
        endpoints. 

     3. RSVP-TE signaling extensions 

     3.1. Cost Collection Flag 

           In order to indicate that cost collection is desired, a new 
        flag in the Attribute Flags TLV which can be carried in an 
        LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Objects is required:  

        Cost Collection flag (to be assigned by IANA, recommended bit 
        position 11) 

           The Cost Collection flag is meaningful in a Path message. If 
        the Cost Collection flag is set to 1, the transit nodes SHOULD 
        report the cost information in the Path Record Route Object 
        (RRO) and the Resv RRO. 

        The procedure for processing the Attribute Flags TLV follows 
        [RFC5420].

     3.2. Latency Collection Flag 

           In order to indicate that latency collection is desired, a 
        new flag in the Attribute Flags TLV which can be carried in an 
        LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object is required: 

        Latency Collection flag (to be assigned by IANA, recommended bit 
        position 12) 

           The Latency Collection flag is meaningful on a Path message. 
        If the Latency Collection flag is set to 1, the transit nodes 
        SHOULD report the latency information in the Path RRO and the 
        Resv RRO.  

        The procedure for the processing the Attribute Flags TLV follows 
        [RFC5420]. 

     3.3. Latency Variation Collection Flag 

           In order to indicate that latency variation collection is 
        desired, a new flag in the Attribute Flags TLV which can be 
        carried in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object 
        is required: 

        Latency Variation Collection flag (to be assigned by IANA, 
        recommended bit position 13) 

           The Latency Variation Collection flag is meaningful on a Path 
        message. If the Latency Variation Collection flag is set to 1, 
        the transit nodes SHOULD report the latency variation 
        information in the Path RRO and the Resv RRO.  

        The procedure for the processing the Attribute Flags TLV follows 
        [RFC5420].  

     3.4. Cost subobject 

           A new cost subobject is defined for the RRO to record the 
        cost information of the LSP. Its format is similar to the RRO 
        subobjects defined in [RFC3209].

           Reserved: This field is reserved for future use. It MUST be 
           set to 0 when sent and MUST be ignored when received. 

           Cost Value: Cost of the link along the route of the LSP. 
           Based on the policy at the recording node, the cost value can 
           be set to the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) metric or TE 
           metric of the link in question. This approach has been taken 
           to avoid defining a flag for each cost type in the Attribute-
           Flags TLV. It is assumed that, based on policy, all nodes 
           reports the same cost-type and that the ingress and egress 
           nodes know the cost type reported in the RRO.

           LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Objects and RRO are not changed.  

     3.5. Latency subobject 

        A new Latency subobject is defined for RRO to record the latency 
        information of the LSP. Its format is similar the RRO subobjects 
        defined in [RFC3209].

           over a configurable interval in micro-seconds, encoded as an 
           integer value. When set to 0, it has not been measured. When 
           set to the maximum value 16,777,215 (16.777215 sec), then the 
           delay is at least that value and may be larger.

           A new Latency Variation subobject is defined for RRO to

           not been measured. When set to the maximum value 16,777,215 
           (16.777215 sec), then the delay is at least that value and 
           may be larger. 

           The rules for processing the LSP_ATTRIBUTES and 
           LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Objects and RRO are not changed.  

     3.7. Signaling Procedures 

           Typically, the ingress node learns the route of an LSP by 
        adding a RRO in the Path message. If an ingress node also 
        desires cost, latency and/or latency variation recording, it 
        sets the appropriate flag(s) in the Attribute Flags TLV of the 
        LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object. None, all or 
        any of the Cost Collection, Latency Collection or Latency 
        Variation Collection flags may be set in the Attribute Flags TLV 
        of the LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object.  

           When a node receives a Path message which carries an 
        LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object and the Cost, Latency and/or 

     Ali, Swallow, Filsfils         Expires August 2013        [Page 7] 
     Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-ccamp-te-metric-recording-00.txt 
      
        Latency Variation Collection Flag(s) is (are) set, if local 
        policy disallows providing the requested information to the 
        endpoints, the node MUST return a Path Error message with error 
        code "Policy Control Failure (2)" and one of the following error 
        subcodes: 

        .  "Cost Recoding Rejected" (value to be assigned by IANA, 
          suggest value 105) if Cost Collection Flag is set.  

        .  "Latency Recording Rejected" (value to be assigned by IANA, 
          suggest value 106) if Latency Collection Flag is set. 

        .  "Latency Variation Recording Rejected" (value to be assigned 
          by IANA, suggest value 107) if Latency Variation Collection 
          Flag is set. 

        When a node receives a Path message which carries an 
        LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object and the Cost, Latency and/or Latency 
        Variation Collection Flag(s) is (are) set, if local policy 
        disallows providing the requested information to the endpoints, 
        the node MAY return a Path Error as described for the 
        LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object. 

        If local policy permits the provision of the requested 
        information, the processing node SHOULD add the requested 
        subobject(s) with the cost, latency or/ and latency variation 
        metric value(s) associated with the local hop to the Path RRO. 
        It then forwards the Path message to the next node in the 
        downstream direction.  

           Following the steps described above, the intermediate nodes 
        of the LSP provide the requested metric value(s) associated with 
        the local hop in the Path RRO. When the Path message is received 
        by the egress node, the egress node can calculate the end-to-end 
        cost, latency and/or latency variation properties of the LSP.  

           Before the Resv message is sent to the upstream node, the 
        egress node adds the requested subobject(s) with the cost, 
        latency or/ and latency variation metric value(s) associated 
        with the local hop to the Resv RRO in a similar manner to that 
        specified above for the addition of Path RRO sub-objects by 
        midpoint nodes.  

        Similarly, the intermediate nodes of the LSP provide the 
        requested metric value(s) associated with the local hop in the 
        Resv RRO. When the Resv message is received by the ingress node, 
        it can calculate the end-to-end cost, latency or/ and latency 
        variation properties of the LSP.  

        Typically, cost and latency are additive metrics, but latency 
        variation is not an additive metric. The means by which the 
        ingress and egress nodes compute the end-to-end cost, latency

        and latency variation metric from information recorded in the 
        RRO is beyond the scope of this document.   

        Based on the local policy, the ingress and egress nodes can 
        advertise the calculated end-to-end cost, latency and/or latency 
        variation properties of the FA/ RA LSP in TE link advertisement 
        to the routing instance based on the procedure described in 
        [DRAFT-OSPF-TE-METRIC], [DRAFT-ISIS-TE-METRIC]. 

        Based on the local policy, a transit node (e.g. the edge node of 
        a domain) may edit a Path or Resv RRO to remove route 
        information (e.g. node or interface identifier information) 
        before forwarding it. A node that does this SHOULD summarize the 
        cost, latency and latency variation data removed as a single 
        value for each for the loose hop that is summarized by the 
        transit node. How a transit node calculates the cost, latency 
        or/ and latency variation metric for the segment summarized by 
        the transit node is beyond the scope of this document.   

     4. Security Considerations 

        This document does not introduce any additional security issues 
        above those identified in [RFC5920], [RFC5420], [RFC2205], 
        [RFC3209], and [RFC3473]. 

     5. IANA Considerations 

     5.1. RSVP Attribute Bit Flags 

           The IANA has created a registry and manages the space of 
        attributes bit flags of Attribute Flags TLV as described in 
        section 11.3 of [RFC5420]. It is requested that the IANA makes 
        assignments from the Attribute Bit Flags defined in this 
        document. 

           This document introduces the following three new Attribute 
        Bit Flag: 

              - Bit number: TBD (recommended bit position 11) 

              - Defining RFC: this I-D 

              - Name of bit: Cost Collection Flag 

         

              - Bit number: TBD (recommended bit position 12) 

              - Defining RFC: this I-D 

              - Name of bit: Latency Collection Flag

              - Bit number: TBD (recommended bit position 13) 

              - Defining RFC: this I-D 

              - Name of bit: Latency Variation Flag 

         

        5.2. ROUTE_RECORD subobject 

           This document introduces the following three new RRO 
        subobject: 

                     Type       Name                        Reference 

                     ---------  ----------------------      --------- 

                     TBD (35)   Cost subobject              This I-D 

                     TBD (36)   Latency subobject           This I-D 

                     TBD (37)   Latency Variation subobject This I-D 

     5.2. New RSVP error sub-code  

        For Error Code = 2 "Policy Control Failure" (see [RFC2205]) the 
        following sub-code is defined. 
         
           Sub-code                              Value 
           --------                              ----- 
      
           Cost Recoding Rejected                To be assigned by IANA. 
                                                 Suggested Value: 105.   
         
           Latency Recoding Rejected             To be assigned by IANA. 
                                                 Suggested Value: 106.   
      
           Latency Variation Recoding Rejected   To be assigned by IANA. 
                                                 Suggested Value: 107.
