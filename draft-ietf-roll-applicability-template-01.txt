1.  Introduction

   This document describes a series of questions which should be
   answered.  This document is intended to remain as a Internet Draft.

   The idea is that current and future Applicability statements will use
   the table of contents provided.  The goal is that all applicability
   statements will have to cover the listed items as a minimum.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   (RFC2119 reference)

1.2.  Terminology

   A reference to draft-ietf-roll-terminology is appropriate.  A
   reference to layer-2 specific terminology and/or inclusion of any
   terms that are normatively referenced is appropriate here.

1.3.  Required Reading

   References/Overview of requirements documents, both IETF and industry
   group. (two pages maximum.  This text should be (very) technical,
   should be aimed at IETF *participants*, not industry group
   participants, and should explain this industries' specific issues)

1.4.  Out of scope requirements

   This should list other documents (if any) which deal with situations
   where things are not in scope for this document.

   (For instance, the AMI document tries to cover both line-powered
   urban metering networks, and energy-constrained metering networks,
   and also tries to deal with rural requirements.  This should be three
   or four documents, so this section should list the limits of what
   this document covers)

2.  Deployment Scenario

2.1.  Network Topologies

   describe a single scenario, with possibly multiple topologies that a
   single utility would employ.

2.2.  Traffic Characteristics

   Explain what kind of traffic is being transmitted, where it is
   initiated, and what kinds of protocols (CoAP, multicast, HTTPS, etc.)
   are being used.  Explain what assumptions are being made about
   authentication and authorization in those protocols.

2.2.1.  General

2.2.2.  Source-sink (SS) communication paradigm

2.2.3.  Publish-subscribe (PS, or pub/sub) communication paradigm

2.2.4.  Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication paradigm

2.2.5.  Peer-to-multipeer (P2MP) communication paradigm

2.2.6.  Additional considerations: Duocast and N-cast

2.2.7.  RPL applicability per communication paradigm

2.3.  Layer-2 applicability.

   Explain what layer-2 technologies this statement applies to, and if
   there are options, they should be listed generally here, and
   specifically in section 4.2.

3.  Using RPL to Meet Functional Requirements

   This should explain in general terms how RPL is going to be used in
   this network topology.  If trees that are multiple layers deep are
   expected, then this should be described so that the fan out is
   understood.  Some sample topologies (from simulations) should be
   explained, perhaps with images references from other publications.

   This section should tell an *implementer* in a lab, having a
   simulation tool or a building/city/etc. to use as a testbed, how to
   construct an LLN of sufficient complexity (but not too much) to
   validate an implementation.

4.  RPL Profile

   This section should list the various features of RPL plus other
   layers of the LLN, and how they will be used.

4.1.  RPL Features

4.1.1.  RPL Instances

4.1.2.  Storing vs. Non-Storing Mode

4.1.3.  DAO Policy

4.1.4.  Path Metrics

4.1.5.  Objective Function

4.1.6.  DODAG Repair

4.1.7.  Multicast

4.1.8.  Security

4.1.9.  P2P communications

4.1.10.  IPv6 address configuration

4.2.  Layer-2 features

4.2.1.  Specifics about layer-2

   this section should detail the specific layer-2 network technology
   that this document applies to.  A class of technologies is generally
   not acceptable.

4.2.2.  Services provided at layer-2

4.2.3.  6LowPAN options assumed.

4.2.4.  MLE and other things

4.3.  Recommended Configuration Defaults and Ranges

4.3.1.  Trickle Parameters

4.3.2.  Other Parameters

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Security Considerations during initial deployment

   (This section explains how nodes get their initial trust anchors,
   initial network keys.  It explains if this happens at the factory, in
   a deployment truck, if it is done in the field, perhaps like http://
   www.lix.polytechnique.fr/hipercom/SmartObjectSecurity/papers/
   CullenJennings.pdf)

6.2.  Security Considerations during incremental deployment

   (This section explains how that replaces a failed node takes on the
   dead nodes' identity, or not.  How are nodes retired.  How are nodes
   removed if they are compromised)

6.3.  Security Considerations for P2P uses

   (When layer-3 RPL security is used, P2P DODAGs are ephemeral, and may
   have different security needs.)
