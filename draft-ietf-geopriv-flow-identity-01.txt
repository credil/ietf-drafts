                    Flow Identity Extension for HELD
                  draft-ietf-geopriv-flow-identity-01

Abstract

   RFC 6155 specifies an extension for the HTTP-Enabled Location
   Delivery (HELD) Protocol allowing the use of an IP address and port
   number to request a Device location based on an individual packet
   flow.

   However, certain kinds of NAT require that identifiers for both ends
   of the packet flow must be specified in order to unambiguously
   satisfy the location request.

   This document specifies an XML Schema and URN Sub-Namespace for a
   Flow Identity Extension for HELD to support this requirement.

   This document updates RFC 6155 by deprecating the port number
   elements specified therein.

Internet-Draft           Flow Identity for HELD            February 2013


1.  Introduction

   Work at the Emergency Location Task Group of NICC Standards Ltd (the
   UK's telecoms industry standards body) prompted the addition of Port
   Number identifiers in HELD Identity [RFC6155] to allow HELD [RFC5985]
   requests for target Devices that are behind a NAT device.

   Subsequent analysis has determined that in the presence of particular
   types of NAT device, and in particular Carrier Grade NATs, it is
   necessary to know the complete tuple of (layer 3 protocol, layer 4
   protocol, source address, source port, destination address,
   destination port) in order to unambiguously identify a flow, and
   therefore the true target Device.

   This document specifies an XML Schema and URN Sub-Namespace for a
   Flow Identity Extension to support this requirement.

   Since the Location Recipient may not know in advance whether the
   Target is behind a NAT device the port number elements from Section
   3.3 of [RFC6155] are deprecated and MUST NOT be used.  This document
   provides a more generally applicable means of identifying a Device
   based on the parameters of a network flow of which it is an endpoint.

3.  Usage

   An example HELD request is shown below:

   <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held"
                         responseTime="8">
     <locationType exact="true">geodetic</locationType>
     <flow xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:flow"
       layer4="tcp" layer3="ipv4">
       <src>
         <address>192.168.1.1</address>
         <port>1024</port>
       </src>
       <dst>
         <address>10.0.0.1</address>
         <port>80</port>
       </dst>
     </flow>
   </locationRequest>

   The <flow> element MUST contain:

   o  a "layer3" attribute with a value of "ipv4" or "ipv6".

   o  a "layer4" attribute with a value of "udp" [RFC0768], "tcp"
      [RFC0793], "sctp" [RFC4960], "dccp" [RFC4340], or a decimal
      integer representing any applicable protocol from the IANA
      Assigned Internet Protocol Numbers Registry.

   and MAY optionally contain:

   o  a "target" attribute with a value of "src" (default) or "dst" to
      indicate which end of the flow is the Target of the
      <locationRequest> with respect to the HELD protocol.
