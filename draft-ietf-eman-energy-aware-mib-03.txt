     1. Introduction 

        The EMAN standards provides network administrators with a 
        specification for Energy Management. This document defines a 
        subset of a Management Information Base (MIB) for use with 
        network management protocols for Energy monitoring of Electrical 
        Equipments (for example network devices and devices attached to 
        the network.)  
         
        This focus of this MIB module is on monitoring Energy Objects as 
        defined in [EMAN-FMWK].  The module addresses Energy Object 
        Identification, Energy Object Context, and Energy Object 
        Relationships. 
      
        Devices and their sub-components are characterized by the power-
        related attributes of a physical entity present in the ENTITY 
        MIB [RFC4133]. 
          
         
     1.1. Energy Management Document Overview 

        This document specifies the Energy-Aware Networks and Devices 
        MIB.  This document is based on the Energy Management Framework 
        [EMAN-FMWK] and meets the requirements specified in the Energy 
        Management requirements [EMAN-REQ]. 
                           
        The Power and Energy Monitoring MIB [EMAN-MON-MIB] contains the  
        Energy Objects for monitoring of Power States, along with the 
        Power and Energy consumption of Electrical Objects.  Power State 
        monitoring includes: retrieving Power States, Power State 
        properties, current Power State, Power State transitions, and 
        Power State statistics.  This MIB module provides the detailed 
        properties of the Power, Energy, along with optional 
        characteristics.

        EDITOR'S NOTE: Replace characteristics with consensus term when 
        defined. This is electrical qualities or characteristics. 
         
        The applicability statement document [EMAN-AS] provides the list 
        of use cases, cross-reference between existing standards and the 
        EMAN standard, and shows how the EMAN framework relates to other 
        frameworks. 
         
         
     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
        current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to 
        section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
         
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
        Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
        (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant with  
        SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, 
        RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
         
     3. Requirements and Use Cases 

        Requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking 
        devices are specified in [EMAN-REQ].  The requirements in [EMAN-
        REQ] include communications network devices, such as switches, 
        routers, and various connected endpoints and Electrical 
        Equipments.     
         
        The use cases for this MIB are specified in the EMAN 
        applicability statement document [EMAN-AS].  
         
        EDITOR'S NOTE: say a few words about the use cases when we will 
        have a stable version of the EMAN applicability statement 
        document. 
         
        Accordingly, the scope of the MIB module in this document is in 
        accordance to the requirements specified in [EMAN-REQ] and the 
        use cases in [EMAN-AS].

     Internet-Draft <Energy-aware Networks and Devices MIB> Oct 2011 
      
      
        As displayed in figure 1, there are six different logical groups 
        of MIB objects in the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module: 
         
        1) The Energy Object Identification. See Section 5.1 "Energy 
           Object Identification" 
        2) The Context Information. See Section 5.2 "Energy Object 
           Context" 
        3) The links to other MIB modules. See Section 5.3 "Links to 
           other Identifiers"  
        4) The Energy Object Child Relationships specific information. 
           See Section 5.4 "Child: Energy Objects Relationship." 
        5) The Energy Object Parent Relationships specific information. 
           See Section 5.5 "Parent: Energy Objects Relationship." 
        6) The Energy Object Identity Persistence. See Section 5.6 
           "Energy Object Identity Persistence" 
         
         
     5.1 Energy Object Identification    

        Refer to the "Energy Object Information" section in [EMAN-FMWK] 
        for background information about Energy Objects.   
         
        Every Energy Object MUST support the unique index, 
        entPhysicalIndex, from the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133], which is used 
        as index for the primary Energy Object information in the 
        ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module eoTable table. 
           
        The ENERGY-AWARE-MIB MIB module, specified in this document 
        requires the implementation of some managed objects in the 
        ENTITY MIB [RFC4133].   

        Other ENTITY MIB managed objects MAY be implemented.  

        Every Energy Object MUST have a printable name. Energy Objects 
        MUST implement the entPhysicalName object specified in the 
        ENTITY-MIB, which must contain the Energy Object name.  

        By the [RFC4133] definition, the entPhysicalUris contains a 
        white space separated list of  Uniform Resource Identifier 
        (s)(URIs).  For the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB compliance, every Energy 
        Object instance MUST implement the entPhysicalUris from the 
        ENTITY MIB [RFC4133].  The entPhysicalUris MUST contain the 
        Energy Object UUID, according to [RFC4122].    

        As displayed in [RFC4122], the following is an example of the 
        string representation of a UUID as a URN: urn:uuid:f81d4fae-
        7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6.

     Internet-Draft <Energy-aware Networks and Devices MIB> Oct 2011 
      
        Other ENTITY MIB managed objects, next to entPhysicalIndex, 
        entPhysicalName, and entPhysicalUris, MAY be implemented. 

        When a Energy Object Parent acts as a Power Aggregator or a 
        Power Proxy, the Energy Object Parent and its Energy Object 
        Child/Children MUST be members of the same Energy Management 
        Domain, specified by the eoDomainName MIB Object.  
         
        Each Energy Object MUST belong to a single Energy Management 
        Domain or in other words, a Energy Object cannot belong to more 
        than one Energy Management Domain.  Refer to the "Energy 
        Management Domain" section in [EMAN-FMWK] for background 
        information.  The eoDomainName, which is an element of the 
        eoTable, is a read-write MIB object.  The Energy Management 
        Domain should map 1-1 with a metered or sub-metered portion of 
        the site.  The Energy Management Domain MUST be configured on 
        the Energy Object Parent.  The Energy Object Children MAY 
        inherit their domain parameters from the Energy Object Parent or 
        the Energy Management Domain MAY be configured directly in a 
        Energy Object Child.  
         
        The eoMgmtMacAddress, eoMgmtAddress, eoMgmtAddressType, and 
        eoMgmtDNSName MIB objects SHOULD be implemented for Energy 
        Object Children, and MAY be implemented for Energy Object 
        Parents. 
         
         

     5.2 Energy Object Context 

        Refer to the "Energy Object Context" section in [EMAN-FMWK] for 
        background information. 
         
        A Energy Object can provide a eoImportance value in the range of 
        1..100 to help differentiate the use or relative value of the 
        device.  The importance range is from 1 (least important) to 100 
        (most important).  The default importance value is 1.   
      
        A Energy Object can provide a set of eoKeywords.  These keywords 
        are a list of tags that can be used for grouping and summary 
        reporting within or between Energy Management Domains. 
         
        Additionally, a Energy Object can provide a eoRoleDescription

     5.3 Links to Other Identifiers    

        While the entPhysicalIndex is the primary index for all MIB 
        objects in the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module, the Energy Management 
        Systems (EnMS) must be able to make the link with the 
        identifier(s) in other supported MIB modules. 
         
        The Energy Object eoethPortIndex and eoethPortGrpIndex MUST 
        contain the values of pethPsePortIndex and pethPsePortGroupIndex 
        from the Power over Ethernet MIB [RFC3621], if the Power over 
        Ethernet MIB is supported by the Energy Object SNMP agent. 
      
        The Energy Object eoLldpPortNumber MUST contain the 
        lldpLocPortNum from the LLDP MIB [LLDP-MIB], if the LLDP-MED MIB 
        is supported on the Energy Object SNMP agent. 
         
        The intent behind the links to the other MIB module 
        identifier(s) is to correlate the instances in the different MIB 
        modules.  This will allow the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB to reference 
        other MIB modules in cases where the Power over Ethernet and the 
        LLDP MIB modules are supported by the SNMP agent.  Some use 
        cases may not implement any of these two MIB modules for the 
        Energy Objects.  However, in situation where any of these two 
        MIB modules is implemented, the EnMS must be able to correlate 
        the instances in the different MIB modules. 
         
        The eoAlternateKey alternate key object specifies a manufacturer 
        defined string that can be used to identify the Energy Object.  
        Since EnMS may need to correlate objects across management 
        systems, this alternate key is provided to facilitate such a 
        link.  This optional value is intended as a foreign key or 
        alternate identifier for a manufacturer or EnMS to use to 
        correlate the unique Energy Object Id in other systems or 
        namespaces. If an alternate key is not available or is not 
        applicable then NULL should be returned. 
                        
         
     5.4 Child: Energy Object Relationships 

        Refer to the "Energy Object Parent and Child" section in [EMAN-
        FMWK] for background information. 
         
        In order to link the Energy Object Child and the Energy Object 
        Parent, multiple objects are introduced in the MIB module.  
        Depending on the Energy Object Relationship type, the following 
        objects are appropriate: 
         
      
      
     <Parello, Claise>       Expires April 30, 2012            [Page 9]

         Metering Relationship         ->   eoMeteredBy 
         
         Power Source Relationship     ->   eoPoweredBy 
         
         Dependency Relationship       ->   eoDependentOf 
         
         Aggregation Relationship      ->   eoAggregatedBy 
         
          Proxy Relationship            ->   eoProxyBy, 
                                        ->   eoParentProxyAbilities 
         
        Each object contains the list of Energy Object Parent UUIDs for 
        the specific Energy Object Relationship type.  The UUIDs MUST 
        comply to the RFC 4122 specifications.  The object contains URIs 
        and, therefore, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 
        3986 [RFC3986], section 2.  Multiple URIs may be present and are 
        separated by white space characters.  Leading and trailing white 
        space characters are ignored. 
               
        For example, if an Energy Object Child is powered by two power 
        sources, eoPoweredBy would contain the two power sources UUIDs, 
        separated by a space: "urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-
        00a0c91e6bf6 urn:uuid:abcdec11-7abc-23e1-b876-00a0c91e6bf8". 
         
        The eoParentProxyAbilities object is specific to the Proxy 
        Relationship.  This object describes the capabilities of the 
        Energy Object Parent for the Energy Object Child represented by 
        the entPhysicalIndex. The possible capabilities are: report, 
        configuration, and/or wakeonlan.  This object only applies to an 
        Energy Object Child.  
         
        If the Energy Object is not an Energy Object Child, or if the 
        Energy Object doesn't have a Energy Object Relationship, the 
        eoMeteredBy, eoPoweredBy, eoDependentOf, eoAggregatedBy, 
        eoProxyBy, and eoParentProxyAbilities objects are not 
        instantiated.  A zero length octet string MAY also be returned 
        in this case. 
      
        The Energy Object Child can indicate that it wants its Energy 
        Object Parent to proxy capabilities such as, energy reporting, 
        power state configurations, non physical wake capabilities (such 
        as Wake-on-LAN)), or any combination of capabilities.  These 
        capabilities are indicated in the eoParentProxyAbilities object. 
        In the case of Energy Object Parent, the eoParentProxyAbilities 
        MUST be set to "none" (0).

        Since the communication between the Energy Object Parent and 
        Energy Object Child may not be via SNMP (as defined in EMAN-
        FMWK), a Energy Object Child can have additional MIB objects 
        that can be used for easier identification by the EnMS. The 
        optional objects eoMgmtMacAddress, eoMgmtAddressType 
        eoMgmtDNSName can be used to help identify the relationship 
        between the child and other NMS objects.  These objects can be 
        used as an alternate key to help link the Energy Object with 
        other keyed information that may be stored within the EnMS(s). 
         
        The eoMeteredBy, eoPoweredBy, eoDependentOf, eoAggregatedBy, 
        eoProxyBy, and eoParentProxyAbilities implementations are 
        optional. 
         
        

     5.5 Parent: Energy Object Relationships 

        When the Energy Object is an Energy Object Parent, the 
        eoChildrenList object represents the list of Energy Object 
        Child(ren) UUIDs.  This UUID list will help in the network 
        discovery of Energy Objects, using the Energy Object Parent as 
        entry points. 
         
        eoChildrenList has the same format as the eoMeteredBy, 
        eoPoweredBy, eoDependentOf, eoAggregatedBy, and eoProxyBy. The 
        UUIDs MUST comply to the RFC 4122 specifications.  The UUIDs 
        MUST comply to the RFC 4122 specifications.  The eoChildrenList 
        object contains URIs and, therefore, the syntax of this object 
        must conform to RFC 3986 [RFC3986], section 2.  Multiple URIs 
        may be present and are separated by white space characters.  
        Leading and trailing white space characters are ignored. 
         
        If the Energy Object is not an Energy Object Parent, the 
        eoChildrenList objects is not instantiated.  A zero length octet 
        string MAY also be returned in this case. 
         
        The eoChildrenList implementation is optional. 
         
         
         
     5.6 Energy Object Identity Persistence

        In some situations, the Energy Object identity information 
        should be persistent even after a device reload.  For example, 
        in a static setup where a switch monitors a series of connected 
        PoE phones, there is a clear benefit for the EnMS if the Energy 
        Object Identification and all associated information persist, as 
        it saves a network discovery.  However, in other situations, 
        such as a wireless access point monitoring the mobile user PCs, 
        there is not much advantage to persist the Energy Object 
        Information.  Therefore, a specific MIB object, the 
        eoTablePersistence, enables and disables the persistence 
        globally for all Energy Objects information in the ENERGY-AWARE-
        MIB module. 

         
     6. Structure of the MIB 

        The primary MIB object in this MIB module is the energyAwareMIB 
        Object.  The eoTable table of energyAwareMIB Object describes an 
        entity in the network that is a Energy Object according the 
        [EMAN-FMWK].

     8. Security Considerations  

        Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects 
        with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is 
        thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these 
        objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects 
        when sending them over the network via SNMP.   
         
        There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB 
        modules with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
        create.  Such objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable 
        in some network environments.  The support for SET operations in 
        a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a 
        negative effect on network operations.  The following are the 
        tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         
          . Unauthorized changes to the eoDomainName, entPhysicalName, 
             eoRoleDescription, eoKeywords, and/or eoImportance MAY 
             disrupt power and energy collection, and therefore any 
             predefined policies defined in the network. 
         
      
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using 
        IPsec), there is still no secure control over who on the secure 
        network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB modules. 
         
         
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).

        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 
         
         
     9. IANA Considerations 

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 
         
          Descriptor                         OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
          ----------                         ----------------------- 
          energyAwareMIB                     { mib-2 xxx } 
                     
        Additions to this MIB module are subject to Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        requested MIB objects for completeness and accuracy of the 
        description.  Requests for MIB objects that duplicate the 
        functionality of existing objects SHOULD be declined.  The 
        smallest available OID SHOULD be assigned to a new MIB objects.  
        The specification of new MIB objects SHOULD follow the structure 
        specified in Section 6 and MUST be published using a well-
        established and persistent publication medium.
