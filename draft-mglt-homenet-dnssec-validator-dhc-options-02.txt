                     DNSSEC Validators DHCP Options
         draft-mglt-homenet-dnssec-validator-dhc-options-02.txt

Abstract

   DNSSEC provides data integrity and authentication for DNSSEC
   validators.  However, without valid trust anchor(s) and an acceptable
   value for the current time, DNSSEC validation cannot be performed.
   As a result, there are multiple cases where DNSSEC validation MUST
   NOT be performed.  In addition, this list of exceptions is expected
   to become larger over time.

   Considering an increasing number of cases where DNSSEC is disabled
   adds complexity to the DNSSEC validator implementations and increases
   the vectors that disable security.

   This document assumes that DNSSEC adoption by end devices requires
   that end devices MUST be able to support a DNSSEC validation always
   set.  This MUST be valid today as well as in the future.

   This document describes DHCP Options to provision the DHCP Client
   with valid trust anchors and time so DNSSEC validation can be
   performed.

2.  Introduction

   DNSSEC [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035] adds data authentication and
   integrity checks to DNS [RFC1034], [RFC1035].  For signature
   validation, DNSSEC requires a trust anchor such as the Key Signing

Internet-Draft       DNSSEC Validator DHCP Options          October 2013


   Key (KSK) of the Root Zone or any other zone.  Without a trust
   anchor, DNSSEC validation cannot be performed.  In addition KSKs and
   signatures are valid for a given period of time.  As a result, DNSSEC
   validation cannot be performed if time shifting is to large.

   This document considers DHCP DNSSEC Trust Anchor Option and DHCP Time
   Option to provision a device with trusted KSKs and current time.
   Although our priority is to provide the Root Zone KSK, we also
   consider the case other trusted KSK MAY be provided, for example, if
   a Zone does not provide secure delegation, or to mitigate badly
   configured DNSSEC zones (like TLDs zones).

   The main motivation for these DHCP Options is that DHCP enabled
   devices have DNSSEC validation always set and do not need to perform
   DNS resolution without DNSSEC validation.  In fact, enabling DNS with
   no validation represents a potential way to remove security and MAY
   be used by attackers.  Similarly, DNSSEC configuration implemented in
   the end users device, MAY not consider future cases and MAY introduce
   vulnerabilities.  DHCP Options prevent this as long as the
   relationship between DHCP Client and DHCP Server is trusted.

   This document assumes that the channel between the DHCP Client and
   the DHCP Server is trusted and secured with DHCP mechanisms described
   in [RFC3315], or IPsec [RFC4301].

3.  Threat Model

   This document addresses the case of a device configured with DNSSEC
   validation set that is plugged in, gets connectivity (using DHCP for
   example), but fails DNSSEC resolutions because its trust anchor KSK
   is not valid anymore or its local time is not valid.

   This threat mainly addresses devices that can be switched off for a
   long period of time or devices that MAY be off-shelves for a long
   time before being plugged in.  CPEs as well as any homenet devices
   are concerned by this use case.

   This threat also addresses DNSSEC emergency key roll over operations.
   Devices that have cached the out-of-date KSK will not be able to
   check the signatures until the TTL has expired on all caches.

   This document proposes DHCP Options that provide the necessary
   parameters to perform DNSSEC validation.  These Options MUST be used
   on a trusted network over a trusted channel between the DHCP Client
   and the DHCP Server.  These options MAY be used in conjunction of
   additional mechanisms.

3.1.  Motivations for providing DNSSEC Trust Anchor



Migault (Ed)             Expires April 24, 2014                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       DNSSEC Validator DHCP Options          October 2013


   The first motivation for providing trusted KSKs is to provide
   automatic configuration of devices to enable DNSSEC validation.  This
   avoids validator initial KSK provisioning issue as well as KSK roll
   over issues.

   A validator MAY not be able to perform signature check with an
   authenticated KSK because:

   - 1)  It does not have a trust anchor (like the Root Zone KSK)

   - 2)  The KSK MAY have been authenticated, stored or cached with an
         expiration date valid but is not valid anymore.  This MAY
         happen in the case of an emergency key roll over, if the device
         has been offline during the key roll over, or if the key roll
         over is not performed as described in [DPS-KSK], [RFC5011].

   - 3)  The chain of trust MAY have been broken.  This can happen to
         non Root Zone KSK only and MAY not involve the responsibility
         of the owner of the zone.  The deeper the Zone is in the
         hierarchy, the more likely this happens.

   - 4)  A DNSSEC zone MAY have been badly signed or a KSK MAY have been
         badly generated.  The DNSSEC MAY be correct, but DNSSEC
         validator MAY keep for a long time the badly generated KSK,
         ZSK...

   The goal of the DHCP DNSSEC Trust Anchor Option is to provide these
   validators trusted anchors like the Root Zone KSK, as well as other
   KSKs (TLDs...) so the validator has the proper KSKs to perform DNSSEC
   validation.

   Most documents are currently focused on the Root Zone KSK for which
   recommendations and alternative mechanisms have been described.  [I-D
   .jabley-dnsop-validator-bootstrap] provides guide lines on how to
   retrieve and select DNSSEC Trust Anchors.  Section 5.3 and [I-D
   .jabley-dnssec-trust-anchor] describes mechanisms to retrieve
   securely the Root Zone KSK relying on TLS security.  It suggests to
   use insecure DNS resolution to set HTTPS connections.  Using HTTPS
   requires downloading the keyDigest id (key-label) from https://
   data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml, followed by an HTTPS
   request at https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/key-label.crt to get
   the whole certificate.

   The key advantages of the DHCP DNSSEC Trust Anchor Option described
   in this document are that we extend the mechanism to any KSK, and
   validators can set DNSSEC validation for all DNS queries.  However,
   we do not see any contradiction between recommendations provided by
   [I-D.jabley-dnsop-validator-bootstrap] and [I-D.jabley-dnssec-trust-

   anchor] and believe the principle described in these documents SHOULD
   be applied by the validators.  Note also that DHCP DNSSEC Trust
   Anchor Option only benefits to validators that are configured via
   DHCP.

   To recover from a DNSSEC failure and remove a particular data from
   cache, [I-D.jabley-dnsop-dns-flush] suggests to use a NOTIFY message
   between Authoritative Servers and Resolvers.  This mechanism is set
   between Recursive Server and Authoritative Servers with a specific
   trusted relationship.  This is probably a selection of TLDs.  This
   document, does not address the DNSSEC failure over Recursive Servers,
   but addresses more specifically DHCP configured devices.  These are
   typically CPEs or End Users.  We believe that configuring and
   restarting DNSSEC validators with DHCP Option, is an easier way to
   cope with this issue.  First the trust relation between DHCP Server
   already exists, we do not need additional trusted channel between
   Authoritative Servers or eventually the Recursive Servers.  Then
   basic implementations of stub resolvers, in CPE or desktops may not
   address NOTIFY message.

3.2.  Motivations for providing Time

   KSKs and signatures are always associated to an expiration time.  As
   a result, DNSSEC validation requires that the validator knows the
   current time.

   A number of mechanisms exists like [TLSDATE] or [RFC5905] for setting
   the time of the device.  In addition, [RFC5908] provides a Network
   Time Protocol (NTP) Server Option for DHCP.  The DHCP Time Option
   described in this document differs from [RFC5908] as it provides an
   estimation of the current time, instead of providing the NTP servers
   location information.  The time value provided by the DHCP Time
   Option should be used only if previously mentioned mechanisms are
   either not implemented on the device or are unavailable.  One of the
   reason MAY be that you MAY need valid DNS(SEC) resolution to use
   these protocols.  The time provided by the DHCP Time Option does not
   have the accuracy of NTP and SHOULD be considered as a best effort
   value.  [I-D.jabley-dnsop-validator-bootstrap] also recommends that
   when time has not been verified by the validator, the signature
   validation SHOULD be done with time off.

   The key advantage of the DHCP Time Option is that it makes possible
   to have DNSSEC validation always set.  It limits the possible DNSSEC
   validation variants which potentially expose the device to disable
   DNSSEC validations.  Note also that DHCP Time Option only benefits to
   validators that are configured via DHCP.

5.  DHCP DNSSEC Trust Anchor Options

   This section describes two options:

   - DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Options: carries the KSK RRset as
         described in [RFC1035] with a DNSKEY RDATA as described in
         [RFC4033].  This data is not integrity protected, nor it can be
         authenticated.  Such data SHOULD be trusted over a trusted DHCP
         channel.

   - DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Options: Carries a certificate
         encoded as described in [RFC4398].  The advantage of the
         Certificate is that is enables authentication of the received
         information by a trusted party.  For example, CPE providers MAY
         provide a trusted certification authority.  Unlike DNSSEC key
         roll over, the CPE provider controls the key roll over of the
         certification authority it provides.

5.1.  DHCP DNSSEC KSK RR Trust Anchor Options

   The DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option provides the RRset as
   mentioned in the DNS(SEC) Zone.  In other words, it carries the RR as
   defined in Section 3.2.  of [RFC1035] and a RDATA DNSKEY as defined
   in Section 2.1 of [RFC4033].  As the RR has a variable length, the
   DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Options follows the recommendation
   format of Section 5.9 of [I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines].

   The DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option provides a certificate.  The
   CERT RR is described in [RFC4398].  Note that only the RDATA
   associated to the CERT is present in the DHCP Option.  As the RR has
   a variable length, the DHCP DNSSEC KSK CERT Trust Anchor Options
   follows the recommendation format of Section 5.9 of [I-D.ietf-dhc-
   option-guidelines].

   The X.509 [RFC5280] certificate MUST have a keyUsage set to
   digitalSignature (0) and nonRepudiation (1).  Subject Alternative
   Name DNS name indicates the name of the zone.

   In order to be compliant with the certificate of the Root Zone
   described [I-D.jabley-dnssec-trust-anchor].  The CERT for a KSK
   SHOULD have a Common Name (CN) with the string "'Zone-FQDN' Zone KSK"
   followed by the time and date of key generation in the format
   specified in [RFC3339].  'Zone-FQDN' is the name of the zone and
   SHOULD be the same as the one mentioned in Subject Alternative Name.
   The resourceRecord Attribute SHOULD be set with the DS RRset.

6.  DHCP Time Option

   The DHCP DNSSEC Time Option is used by the DHCP Server to indicate
   the Time to the DHCP Client.  The Time is provided in a string format
   as specified in [RFC3339] and in [I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines]
   Section  5.8.

7.  DHCP Client Behavior

   DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option, DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor
   Option or DHCP Time Option described in this document are intended
   for DNSSEC validation.  If a connected device is not performing
   DNSSEC validation, it MUST NOT send a DHCP an Option Request DHCP
   Option (ORO) [RFC3315] for any of these options, and MUST ignore all
   these options if provided by the DHCP Server.

   The DHCP sends a DHCP ORO for one or multiple options described in
   the document.  Motivations for sending this Option Request DHCP
   Option is out of scope of the document.  It could be a device
   switched off for a long time, a device that cannot validate the
   DNSSEC responses.

   A channel is considered trusted if 1) the DHCP Server is trusted and
   authenticated and 2) exchanged data between the DHCP Client and the
   DHCP Server is integrity protected.  IPsec [RFC4301], for example,
   MAY be used to establish a secure channel.

   Over a trusted channel, the DHCP Client that performs DNSSEC
   validation MAY send an ORO for any of the DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust
   Anchor Option, the DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option or the DHCP
   Time Option to a DHCP Server.

   Over a trusted channel, the DHCP Client that performs DNSSEC
   validation SHOULD consider the DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option,
   the DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option or the DHCP Time Option sent
   by the DHCP Server.

Internet-Draft       DNSSEC Validator DHCP Options          October 2013


   Over a non trusted channel, the DHCP Client MAY only send ORO for a
   DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option.  This option is the only one
   that MAY be considered by the DHCP Client if sent by the DHCP Server.
   If the DHCP Client does not trust the signer of the certificate, the
   option MUST be ignored.

   When a DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option or a DHCP DNSSEC CERT
   Trust Anchor Option is accepted by the DHCP Client, it MUST remove
   overwrite old values for the KSK with the new one.

   When a DHCP Time Option is accepted by the DHCP Client, it MUST check
   the difference between its clock and the time provided by the Option.
   It SHOULD overwrite its clock value only if the difference is too
   large.

   In any other case, ORO requests MUST NOT be sent by the DHCP Client,
   and options received by the DHCP Server MUST NOT be considered by the
   DHCP Client.  The remaining of the section details when the options
   MUST NOT be requested by the DHCP Client and MUST be ignored by the
   DHCP Client when received by the DHCP Server.

   The DHCP Client MUST NOT send an ORO for a DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust
   Anchor Option, a DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option or a DHCP Time
   Option to a DHCP Server that is either not trusted or not
   authenticated.

   All DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option, a DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust
   Anchor Option or a DHCP Time Option received from DHCP Server that is
   not authenticated or that is not trusted MUST be ignored by the DHCP
   Client.

   The DHCP Client MUST NOT send an ORO for a DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust
   Anchor Option or a DHCP Time Option to a trusted DHCP Server over an
   untrusted channel.  A DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option MAY be
   requested over an untrusted channel since the certificate is signed
   and thus can be authenticated.  A DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor
   Option signed by an untrusted authority MUST be ignored by the DHCP
   Client.

   All DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option or a DHCP Time Option
   received from DHCP Server over a channel that is not trusted MUST be
   ignored by the DHCP Client.

8.  DHCP Server Behavior

   The DHCP Server SHOULD properly answer with the requested options in
   the ORO, even if the DHCP Server does not consider the channel with
   DHCP Client as trusted.

   The DHCP Server MAY also provide DHCP DNSSEC KSK Trust Anchor Option,
   DHCP DNSSEC CERT Trust Anchor Option or DHCP Time Option without
   being requested by the DHCP Client.  This could for example prevent
   failures not detected by the DHCP Client.

9.  DHCP Relay Agent Behavior

   The DHCP Options described in the document do not impact the Relay
   Agent.

10.  IANA Considerations

   The DHCP options detailed in this document is:

   - OPTION_DNSSEC_KSK_RR_TRUST_ANCHOR: TBD

   - OPTION_DNSSEC_KSK_CERT_TRUST_ANCHOR: TBD

   - OPTION_TIME: TBD

11.  Security Considerations

   Security has been discussed in the "DHCP Client Behavior Section".
   As information contained in the payloads are use to enable signature
   validation, these pieces of information MUST be considered only when
   issued by a trusted party, and when integrity protection is provided.

12.  Acknowledgment

   Bringing DNSSEC in Home Networks discussion has started during the
   IETF87 in Berlin with Ted Lemon, Ralph Weber, Normen Kowalewski, and
   Mikael Abrahamsson.  An email discussion has also been initiated by
   Jim Gettys with among others, helpful remarks from Paul Wouters, Joe
   Abley, Michael Ridchardson.
