1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in TCP/IP- based
   internets.  In particular, it defines objects for managing Optical
   parameters associated with Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)
   systems or characterized by the Optical Transport Network (OTN) in
   accordance with the Black-Link approach defined in G.698.2
   [ITU.G698.2]

   Black Link approach allows supporting an optical transmitter/receiver
   pair of one vendor to inject a DWDM channel and run it over an
   optical network composed of amplifiers, filters, add-drop
   multiplexers from a different vendor.  From architectural point of
   view, the "Black Link" is a set of pre-configured/qualified network
   connections between the G.698.2 reference points S and R. The black
   links will be managed at the edges (i.e. the transmitters and
   receivers attached to the S and R reference points respectively) for
   the relevant parameters specified in G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2], G.798
   [ITU.G798], G.874 [ITU.G874], and the performance parameters
   specified G.7710/Y.1701 [ITU-T G.7710] and and G.874.1 [ITU.G874.1].

   The G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] provides optical parameter values for
   physical layer interfaces of Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
   (DWDM) systems primarily intended for metro applications which
   include optical amplifiers.  Applications are defined in G.698.2
   [ITU.G698.2] using optical interface parameters at the single-channel
   connection points between optical transmitters and the optical
   multiplexer, as well as between optical receivers and the optical
   demultiplexer in the DWDM system.  This Recommendation uses a
   methodology which does not specify the details of the optical link,
   e.g. the maximum fibre length, explicitly.  The Recommendation
   currently includes unidirectional DWDM applications at 2.5 and 10
   Gbit/s (with 100 GHz and 50 GHz channel frequency spacing).  Work is
   still underway for 40 and 100 Gbit/s interfaces.  There is
   possibility for extensions to a lower channel frequency spacing.

   This draft refers and supports also the
   draft-kunze-g698-mgnt-ctrl-framework.

   The building of a SNMP MIB describing the optical parameters defined
   in G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] G.798 [ITU.G798], G.874 [ITU.G874],
   parameters specified G.7710/Y.1701 [ITU-T G.7710] allows the
   different vendors and operator to retrieve, provision and exchange
   information related to Optical blak links in a standardized way.
   This facilitates interworking in case of using optical interfaces
   from different vendors at the end of the link.  The MIB, reporting
   the Optical parameters and their values, characterizes the features

   and the performances of the optical components and allow a reliable
   black link design in case of multivendor optical networks.

   Although RFC 3591 [RFC3591] describes and defines the SNMP MIB of a
   number of key optical parameters, alarms and Performance Monitoring,
   a more complete description of optical parameters and processes can
   be found in the ITU-T Recommendations.  Appendix A of this document
   provides an overview about the extensive ITU-T documentation in this
   area.  The same considerations can be applied to the RFC 4054
   [RFC4054]


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] In
   the description of OIDs the convention: Set (S) Get (G) and Trap (T)
   conventions will describe the action allowed by the paramenter.


4.  Overview

   In this document, the term OTN (Optical Transport Network) system is
   used to describe devices that are compliant with the requirements
   specified in the ITU-T Recommendations G.872 [ITU.G872], G.709
   [ITU.G709] , G.798 [ITU.G798], G.874 [ITU.G874], and G.874.1
   [ITU.G874.1] while refers to G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] for the Black Link
   and DWDM parameter description.

   approach, for single-channel connection (Ss and Rs) between
   transmitters (Tx) and receivers (Rx).  Here the DWDM network elements
   include an OM and an OD (which are used as a pair with the opposing
   element), one or more optical amplifiers and may also include one or
   more OADMs.

   The black links are managed at the edges, i.e. at the transmitters

   respectively.  The parameters that could be managed at the black link
   edges are specified in G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] for the optical

   interface, in G.798 [ITU.G798] for the equipment aspect, and in
   G.7710/Y.1701 [ITU.G7710] and G.874 [ITU.G874] for fault management
   and performance monitoring.

   The definitions of the optical parameters are provided below to
   increase the readability of the document, where the definition is
   ended by (G) the parameter can be retrieve with a GET, when (S) it
   can be provisioned by a SET, (G,S) can be either GET and SET.

   To support the management of these parameters, the SNMP MIB in RFC
   3591 [RFC3591] is extended with a new MIB module defined in section
   56 of this document.  This new MIB module includes the definition of
   XXX, which represents the parameters at Tx (S) and Rx (R).

   Editor Note: Yet to be decided, XXX could be OChr configuration and
   monitoring tables.

4.1.1.  General

   The following general parameters from G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] and
   G.694.1 [ITU.G694.1] provide general information at the optical
   interface reference points.

   Minimum channel spacing:
      This is the minimum nominal difference in frequency (in GHz)
      between two adjacent channels (G).

   Bit rate/line coding of optical tributary signals:
      Optical tributary signal class NRZ 2.5G (from nominally 622 Mbit/s
      to nominally 2.67 Gbit/s) or NRZ 10G nominally 2.4 Gbit/s to
      nominally 10.71 Gbit/s. (nominally 2.4 Gbit/s to nominally 10.71
      Gbit/s). 40Gbit/s and 100Gbit/s are under study (G, S).

   FEC Coding:
      This parameter indicate what Forward Error Correction (FEC) code
      is used at Ss and Rs (G, S) (not mentioned in G.698).  EDITOR
      NOTE: Need to check whether this parameter is to be put in "vendor
      specific" parameter or can be a standard paramenter as defined in
      G.698.2.  Is this the various adaptations (FEC encoding types)
      specified in G.798 clauses 12.3.1.1 (with FEC), 12.3.1.2 (without
      FEC), and 12.3.1.5 (vender-specific FEC) .

   Maximum bit error ratio (BER):
      This parameter indicate the maximum Bit error rate can be
      supported by the application at the Receiver.  In case of FEC
      applications it is intended after the FEC correction (G) .

Internet-Draft   draft-galimbe-kunze-g-698-2-snmp-mib-01    October 2011


   Fiber type:
      Fiber type as per fibre types are chosen from those defined in
      ITU-T Recs G.652, G.653, and G.655 (G,S) .

   Wavelength Range (see G.694.1):  [ITU.G694.1]
      This parameter indicate minimum and maximum wavelength spectrum
      (G) in a definite wavelength Band (L, C and S).

   Wavelength Value (see G.694.1):
      This parameter indicates the wavelength value that Ss and Rs will
      be set to work (G, S).

   Vendor Transceiver Class:
      Other than specifying all the Transceiver parameter, it might be
      convenient for the vendors to summarize a set of parameters in a
      single proprietary parameter: the Class of transceiver.  The
      Transceiver classification will be based on the Vendor Name and
      the main TX and RX parameters (i.e.  Trunk Mode, Framing, Bit
      rate, Trunk Type, Channel Band, Channel Grid, Modulation Format,
      Channel Modulation Format, FEC Coding, Electrical Signal Framing
      at Tx, Minimum maximum Chromatic Disperion (CD) at Rx, Maximum
      Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD) at Rx, Maximum differential
      group delay at Rx, Loopbacks, TDC, Pre-FEC BER, Q-factor,
      Q-margin,etc.).  If this parameter is used, the MIB parameters
      specifying the Transceiver characteristics may not be significant
      and the vendor will be responsible to specify the Class contents
      and values.  The Vendor can publish the parameters of its Classes
      or declare to be compatible with published Classes.(G) Optional
      for compliance. (not mentioned in G.698)

   single-channel application codes (see G.698.2):
      This parameter indicates the transceiver application code at Ss
      and Rs as defined in [ITU.G698.2] Chapter 5.3 - this parameter can
      be called Optical Interface Identifier OII as per
      [draft-martinelli-wson-interface-class] (G, S).

4.1.2.  Parameters at Ss

   The following parameters for the interface at point S are defined in
   G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2].

   Maximum and minimum mean channel output power:
      The mean launched power at Ss is the average power (in dBm) of a
      pseudo-random data sequence coupled into the DWDM link.  It is
      defined as the rhange (Max and Min ) of the parameter (G, S)

Internet-Draft   draft-galimbe-kunze-g-698-2-snmp-mib-01    October 2011


   Minimum and maximum central frequency:
      The central frequency is the nominal single-channel frequency (in
      THz) on which the digital coded information of the particular
      optical channel is modulated by use of the NRZ line code.  The
      central frequencies of all channels within an application lie on
      the frequency grid for the minimum channel spacing of the
      application given in ITU-T Rec. G.694.1.  This parameter give the
      Maximum and minimum frequency interval the channel must be
      modulated (G)

   Maximum spectral excursion:
      This is the maximum acceptable difference between the nominal
      central frequency (in GHz) of the channel and the minus 15 dB
      points of the transmitter spectrum furthest from the nominal
      central frequency measured at point Ss.  (G)

   Maximum transmitter (residual) dispersion OSNR penalty (B.3/G.959.1)
      [ITU.G959.1]
      Defines a reference receiver that this penalty is measured with.
      Lowest OSNR at Ss with worst case (residual) dispersion minus the
      Lowest OSNR at Ss with no dispersion.  Lowest OSNR at Ss with no
      dispersion (G)

   Minimum side mode suppression ratio, Minimum channel extinction
   ratio, Eye mask:
      Although are defined in G.698.2 are not supported by this draft.

4.1.3.  Optical path from point Ss to Rs

   The following parameters for the optical path from point S and R are
   defined in G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2].

   Maximum and minimum (residual) chromatic dispersion:
      These parameters define the maximum and minimum value of the
      optical path "end to end chromatic dispersion" (in ps/nm) that the
      system shall be able to tolerate.  (G)

   Minimum optical return loss at Ss:
      These parameter defines minimum optical return loss (in dB) of the
      cable plant at the source reference point (Ss), including any
      connectors (G)

   Maximum discrete reflectance between SS and RS:
      Optical reflectance is defined to be the ratio of the reflected
      optical power present at a point, to the optical power incident to
      that point.  Control of reflections is discussed extensively in
      ITU-T Rec. G.957 (G)

Internet-Draft   draft-galimbe-kunze-g-698-2-snmp-mib-01    October 2011


   Maximum differential group delay:
      Differential group delay (DGD) is the time difference between the
      fractions of a pulse that are transmitted in the two principal
      states of polarization of an optical signal.  For distances
      greater than several kilometres, and assuming random (strong)
      polarization mode coupling, DGD in a fibre can be statistically
      modelled as having a Maxwellian distribution.  (G)

   Maximum polarisation dependent loss:
      The polarisation dependent loss (PDL) is the difference (in dB)
      between the maximum and minimum values of the channel insertion
      loss (or gain) of the black-link from point SS to RS due to a
      variation of the state of polarization (SOP) over all SOPs.  (G)

   Maximum inter-channel crosstalk:
      Inter-channel crosstalk is defined as the ratio of total power in
      all of the disturbing channels to that in the wanted channel,
      where the wanted and disturbing channels are at different
      wavelengths.  The parameter specify the isolation of a link
      conforming to the "black-link" approach such that under the worst-
      case operating conditions the inter-channel crosstalk at any
      reference point RS is less than the maximum inter-channel
      crosstalk value (G)

   Maximum interferometric crosstalk:
      This parameter places a requirement on the isolation of a link
      conforming to the "black-link" approach such that under the worst
      case operating conditions the interferometric crosstalk at any
      reference point RS is less than the maximum interferometric
      crosstalk value.  (G)

   Maximum optical path OSNR penalty:
      The optical path OSNR penalty is defined as the difference between
      the Lowest OSNR at Rs and Lowest OSNR at Ss that meets the BER
      requirement (G)

   Maximum ripple:
      Although is defined in G.698.2, this parameter is not supported by
      this draft.

4.1.4.  Interface at point Rs

   The following parameters for the interface at point R are defined in
   G.698.2.

      The minimum optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) is the minimum
      value of the ratio of the signal power in the wanted channel to
      the highest noise power density in the range of the central
      frequency plus and minus the maximum spectral excursion (G)

      The receiver OSNR tolerance is defined as the minimum value of
      OSNR at point Rs that can be tolerated while maintaining the
      maximum BER of the application.  (G)

   Maximum reflectance at receiver:

4.2.  Use of ifTable

   This section specifies how the MIB II interfaces group, as defined in
   RFC 2863 [RFC2863], is used for the link ends of a black link.  Only
   the ifGeneralInformationGroup will be supported for the ifTable and
   the ifStackTable to maintain the relationship between the OChr and
   OPS layers.  The OChr and OPS layers are managed in the ifTable using
   IfEntries that correlate to the layers depicted in Figure T.B.D. For
   example, a device with TX and/or RX will have an Optical Physical
   Section (OPS) layer, and an Optical Channel with reduced
   functionality (OChr) layer.  There is a one to one relationship
   between the OPS and OChr layers.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:



G.Galimberti, et al.       Expires May 3, 2012                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft   draft-galimbe-kunze-g-698-2-snmp-mib-01    October 2011


   o

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


10.  IANA Considerations

   Option #1:













G.Galimberti, et al.       Expires May 3, 2012                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft   draft-galimbe-kunze-g-698-2-snmp-mib-01    October 2011


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, an internet
   draft MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in an internet draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
