    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The use of cellular broadband for accessing the Internet and other
      data services via smartphones, tablets, and notebook/netbook computers
      has increased rapidly as a result of high-speed packet data networks
      such as HSPA, HSPA+, and now Long-Term Evolution (LTE) being deployed.
      Browsers on these devices are becoming close to their desktop
      counterparts. So, from that perspective, it is feasible to run WebRTC
      applications in them. This draft enumerates problems when WebRTC
      application is used on such devices in the above listed networks.</t>

      <t>This note focuses on QOS, traffic offload problems and does not
      address other mobile network related topics like power consumption,
      interface switching and congestion control related issues already being
      discussed in <xref target="I-D.isomaki-rtcweb-mobile"></xref>.</t>

      <t>UE, MS, MN, and Mobile : The terms UE (User Equipment), MS (Mobile

    <section title="Scope">
      <t>This document can be used as a tool to design solution(s) mitigating
      the encountered issues. Describing the use case allows to identify what
      is common between the use cases and then would help during the solution
      design phase. This note aids WebRTC server designers and network
      architects to facilitate proper deployment of WebRTC in the mobile
      network. WebRTC server could either be deployed in the Mobile Network or
      WebRTC server deployed in a 3rd party network trusted by Mobile Network
      or Public WebRTC server.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="cell" title="Cellular Networks - QOS">
      <t>3GPP has standardized QoS for EPC (Enhanced Packet Core) from Release
      8 <xref target="TS23.107"></xref>. 3GPP QoS policy configuration defines
      access agnostic QoS parameters that can be used to provide service
      differentiation in multi vendor and operator deployments. The concept of
      a bearer is used as the basic construct for which QoS treatment is
      applied for uplink and downlink packet flows between the MN and gateway
      <xref target="TS23.401"></xref>. A bearer may have more than one packet
      filter associated and this is called a Traffic Flow Template (TFT). The
      IP five tuple (IP source address, source port, IP destination,
      destination port, protocol) identifies a packet filter. TFT has other
      attributes like Type of Service (TOS)/DSCP. Each MN can have one or
      multiple bearers associated with its registration, each supporting
      different QoS characteristics. An UpLink Traffic Flow Template (UL TFT)
      is the set of uplink packet filters in a TFT. A DownLink Traffic Flow
      Template (DL TFT) is the set of downlink packet filters in a TFT.</t>

      <t>The access agnostic QoS parameters associated with each bearer are
      QCI (QoS Class Identifier), ARP (Allocation and Retention Priority), MBR
      (Maximum Bit Rate) and optionally GBR (Guaranteed Bit Rate). QCI is a
      scalar that defines packet forwarding criteria in the network. Mapping
      of QCI values to DSCP is well understood and GSMA has defined standard
      means of mapping between these scalars <xref target="GSMA-IR34"></xref>.
      Primarily LTE offers two types of bearer: Guaranteed Bit rate bearer for
      real time communication, e.g., Voice calls etc. and Non-Guaranteed bit
      rate, e.g., best effort traffic for web access etc. Packets mapped to
      the same EPS bearer receive the same bearer level packet forwarding
      treatment.</t>

      <t>The Web Real-Time communication (WebRTC) <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview"> </xref> framework provides the
      protocol building blocks to support direct, interactive, real-time
      communication using audio, video, collaboration, games, etc., between
      two peers' web-browsers. WebRTC application would use Interactive
      Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol <xref target="RFC5245"></xref>
      for gathering candidates, prioritizing them, choosing default ones,
      exchanging them with the remote party, pairing them and ordering them
      into check lists. Once all of the above have been completed then the
      participating ICE agents can begin a phase of connectivity checks and
      eventually select the pair of candidates that will be used for real-time
      communication.</t>

      <t>Problems with WebRTC application in 3GPP Network are that</t>

      <section title="RTP Session Multiplexing">
        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage"></xref> in section 4.4
            suggests to put interactive audio, interactive video over the same
            5-tuple. This means that QoS cannot be applied to the 5-tuple,
            even if it were known. QoS can only be applied by the endpoint by
            setting DSCP appropriately on a per-packet basis. This problem can
            possibly be solved by the proposal in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-qos"></xref>. But 3GPP networks uses
            TFT&rsquo;s packet filtering information to identify and map
            packets to specific bearers. So DSCP value in TFT for the bearer
            will not match the DSCP value in the RTP packets sent by the UE
            and 3GPP network may not honor the DSCP value in the RTP packets.
            In other words both audio/video media streams would be mapped to
            the same EPS bearer thus receiving the same bearer level packet
            forwarding treatement.</t>

            <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage"></xref> in section 4.4
            also proposes not to multiplex interactive audio, interactive
            video over the same 5-tuple for compatibility with legacy systems.
            Mobile Device using WebRTC application in 3GPP network should
            prefer this method until a technique to solve the above problem is
            identified and deployed in the 3GPP network.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Bearer Resource Modification triggered by UE">
        <t>If UE is using Public WebRTC server then the UE can request bearer
        resource modification procedure for an E-UTRAN as explained in section
        5.4.5 of <xref target="TS23.401"></xref>. The procedure allows the UE
        to request for a modification of bearer resources (e.g. Allocation or
        release of resources) for one traffic flow aggregate with a specific
        QoS demand. Alternatively, the procedure allows the UE to request for
        the modification of the packet filters used for an active traffic flow
        aggregate, without changing QoS. If accepted by the network, the
        request invokes either the Dedicated Bearer Activation Procedure or
        the Bearer Modification Procedure.</t>

        <t>Problems with this approach are :</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>When the UE initiates a call using WebRTC application and
            candidate pairs are successfully nominated for each media stream
            then WebRTC application should signal the packet filter (5-tuple),
            QCI and GBR values for each media stream that would initiate
            bearer resource modification or dedicated bearer activation.
            WebRTC application need to be aware of the QCI/GBR values required
            for the media streams.</t>

            <t>This means WebRTC application requires API's to indicate
            OS/Modem the packet filters for each media stream to be added,
            modified or deleted. WebRTC application would need API's to
            indicate OS/Modem the QCI and GBR values for each of the packet
            filters. OS/Modem would inturn signal this information to the 3GPP
            network that would result in either bearer resource modification
            or creation of Dedicated Bearer Activation Procedure.</t>

            <t>WebRTC application may also need API's to trigger the
            modification of the GBR value for existing packet filters.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="WebRTC server deployed in 3GPP Network">
        <t>Currently 3GPP networks prioritize flows by examining the SDP in
        SIP signaling. As WEBRTC also uses SIP and SDP like signaling, similar
        mechanisms can be used to deploy WebRTC server in 3GPP network. <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>3GPP network cannot prioritize all a=candidate lines described
            in <xref target="RFC5245"></xref> until WebRTC server receives an
            indication of the active media path from the controlling ICE
            agent. WebRTC server is aware of the active media path only after
            the controlling ICE endpoint follows the procedures in Section
            11.1 of <xref target="RFC5245"></xref>, specifically to send
            updated offer if the candidates in the m and c lines for the media
            stream (called the DEFAULT CANDIDATES) do not match ICE's SELECTED
            CANDIDATES (also see Appendix B.9 of <xref
            target="RFC5245"></xref>).</t>

            <t>WebRTC server deployed in 3GPP network would need "Rx&rdquo;
            like interface to the Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF).
            The PCRF is the policy server in the EPC. WebRTC server would act
            as "Application Function". Dynamic PCC (policy and charging
            control) rules are derived within the PCRF from information
            supplied by the AF (such as requested bandwidth for the 5-tuple,
            Application Identity etc). PCRF forwards PCC rules for the media
            stream to the Policy Charging and enforcement function (PCEF) for
            Packet scheduling, data packet (Diffserv) marking etc to allow QOS
            to be provisioned in the EPC. Bearers would have be
            modified/created for media streams, assigned and installed on the
            UE.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Deep Packet Inspection">
        <t>3GPP has a current work item on "Service Awareness and Privacy
        Policies" that is chartered to add DPI-related extensions to the PCC
        architecture <xref target="TS23.203"></xref>. The (optional) DPI
        entity in the EPC is called "Traffic Detection Function" (TDF), and it
        performs application detection and reporting of detected application
        and its service data flow description to the Policy Control and
        Charging Rules Function (PCRF) for performing functions such as
        traffic blocking, redirection, policing for selected flows.</t>

        <t>If UE is using Public WebRTC server then<list style="symbols">
            <t>The session signaling between the WebRTC application running in
            the browser and the web server could be using TLS. Moreover WebRTC
            does not enforce a particular session signaling protocol to be
            used, so network gateways in 3GPP network would fail to inspect
            the signalling to identify the 5-tuple used for media stream and
            thus fail to prioritize media traffic. Hence derived service
            identification <xref target="RFC5897"></xref> would not
            succeed.</t>

            <t>Network Gateways by inspecting L7 traffic can only identify RTP
            but fail to distinguish between IPTV vs. Multimedia, Gaming vs.
            Voice Chat, Gaming vs. Voice Chat #2 etc as explained in section
            3.1 - 3.3 of <xref target="RFC5897"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The following section lists the potential problems If UE ues Public
      WebRTC server :</t>

      <section anchor="sipto" title="3GPP SIPTO ">
        <t>Given the exponential growth in the mobile data traffic, Mobile
        Operators are looking for ways to offload some of the IP traffic flows
        at the nearest access edge that has an Internet peering point. This
        approach results in efficient usage of the mobile packet core and
        helps lower the transport cost. Since Release 10, 3GPP starts
        supporting of Selected IP Traffic Offload (SIPTO) function defined in
        <xref target="TS23.060"></xref><xref target="TS23.401">,</xref>. The
        SIPTO function allows an operator to offload certain types of traffic
        at a network node close to the UE's point of attachment to the access
        network. Limited Mobility support available with SIPTO is explained in
        section 2.3.3 of <xref
        target="I-D.zuniga-dmm-gap-analysis"></xref>.</t>

        <t>If SIPTO is carried out in a Traffic offload Function (TOF) entity
        located at the interface of the Radio Access Network i.e. In the path
        between the Radio stations and the Mobile Gateway (MGW). The TOF
        decides which traffic to offload and enforces NAT for that traffic.
        The deployment of a TOF is totally transparent for the UE and hence
        does not know which traffic is subject to TOF (NATed at the TOF) and
        which traffic is processed by the MGW.</t>

        <t>The problem with WebRTC application in such network is that</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>TOF is not aware of the 5-tuple that will used for media and
            data channels. ICE agent would gather server reflexive candidates
            using STUN and relayed candidates are obtained through TURN. If
            STUN messages are offloaded at TOF then UE would learn the
            External IP Address/Port provided by the NAT at TOF. Similarly ICE
            connectivity checks could also be offloaded at TOF. If UE roams,
            though host candidate addresses may not change but NAT will change
            resulting in failure to reach the remote peer for the existing
            media and data channels. If the media and data channels are
            offloaded at the TOF then UE Mobility would result in disruption
            of media and data channel traffic.</t>

            <t>If UE is using local relayed candidate to reach the remote peer
            and roams out of the coverage of RNC/HNB GW then NAT between UE

            allocations and fail to reach the remote peer using local relayed

        <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (or PMIPv6, or PMIP) is a network-based mobility
        management protocol specified in <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>.
        Network-based mobility management enables the same functionality as
        Mobile IP, without any modifications to the host's Protocol stack.
        With PMIP the host can change its point-of-attachment to the Internet
        without changing its IP address.<xref

        signal the Traffic Offload capability of a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)
        to the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in Proxy Mobile IP Networks. Mobile
        access gateway has the ability to offload some of the IPv4 traffic
        flows based on the traffic selectors it receives from the local
        mobility anchor. Using IP Traffic Offload Selector option <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-netext-pmipv6-sipto-option"></xref> mobile access
        gateway will negotiate IP Flows that can be offloaded to the local
