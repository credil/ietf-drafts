                  draft-ietf-alto-server-discovery-06

Abstract

   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
   provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several
   hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired
   resource.  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an
   ALTO client can ask for guidance it needs to discover one or more
   ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance.

   This document specifies a procedure for resource consumer initiated
   ALTO server discovery, which can be used if the ALTO client is
   embedded in the resource consumer.

Internet-Draft            ALTO Server Discovery            November 2012


1.  Introduction

   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
   provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several
   hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired
   resource [RFC5693].  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol,
   see requirement AR-1 in [RFC6708].  Before an ALTO client can ask for
   guidance it needs to discover one or more ALTO servers that can
   provide suitable guidance.

   This document specifies a procedure for resource consumer initiated
   ALTO server discovery, which can be used if the ALTO client is
   embedded in the resource consumer.  In other words, this document
   tries to meet requirement AR-32 in [RFC6708] while AR-33 is out of
   scope.  A significantly more complex approach, which tries to meet
   requirement AR-33, i.e., third-party ALTO server discovery, is
   addressed in [I-D.kist-alto-3pdisc].

   The ALTO protocol specification [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] is based on
   HTTP and expects the discovery procedure to yield an HTTP(S) URI.
   Therefore, this procedure is based on U-NAPTR [RFC4848].  It tries to
   directly find one or more ALTO server(s) that can give suitable
   guidance to the ALTO client.  Other schemes, such as discovering a
   random ALTO server (which might not be able to give suitable guidance
   to the client in question) and asking it to redirect the client to a
   better server, are not considered in this document.

   A more detailed discussion of various options where to place the
   funcional entities comprising the overall ALTO architecture can be
   found in [I-D.ietf-alto-deployments].

   Comments and discussions about this memo should be directed to the
   ALTO working group: alto@ietf.org.

2.  ALTO Server Discovery Procedure Overview

   The ALTO server discovery procedure is performed in two steps:

   1.  A DNS suffix is yielded, either by manual input or by means of
       DHCP.

   2.  This DNS suffix is used for an U-NAPTR lookup yielding the URI.
       Further DNS lookups may be neccessary to determine the ALTO
       server's IP address(es).

   The primary means for retrieving the DNS suffix is DHCP.  However,
   there may be situations where DHCP is not available or does not
   return a suitable value.  Furhermore, there might be situations in
   which the user whishes to override the value that could be retrieved
   from DHCP.  In these situations, manual input may be used.

   Typically, but not neccessarily, the DNS suffix is the domain name in
   which the client is located, i.e., a PTR lookup on the client's IP
   address would yield a similar name.  However, due to the widespread
   use of network address translation (NAT), trying to determine the DNS
   suffix through a PTR lookup on the client's IP address is not
   recommended.

3.  ALTO Server Discovery Procedure Specification

   A already outlined in Section 2 the ALTO server discovery procedure
   is performed in two steps, which will be specified in Section 3.1 and
   Section 3.2, respectively.

3.1.  Step 1: Retrieving the Domain Name

3.1.1.  Step 1, Option 1: User input

   A user may want to use a third party ALTO service instance.
   Therefore we allow the user to specify a DNS suffix on its own, for
   example in a config file option.  The DNS suffix given by the user is
   combined with the IP address of the resource consumer to allow the
   third party ALTO service to direct the client to a suitable ALTO
   server based on the location of the client.  A possible DNS suffix
   entered by the user may be:

      myaltoprovider.org

   In case no ALTO NAPTR records are found, we consider the discovery
   process based on user input as failed.  A client MAY try to continue
   with DHCP (see below).  If DHCP-based discovery succeeds the client
   SHOULD inform the user that the user input has been ignored and
   replaced by information retrieved from the network.

3.1.2.  Step 1, Option 2: DHCP

   As a second option network operators may configure the domain name to
   be used for service discovery within an access network using DHCP.

   RFC 5986 [RFC5986] defines DHCP IPv4 and IPv6 access network domain
   name options that identify a domain name that is suitable for service
   discovery within the access network.  RFC 2132 [RFC2132] defines the
   DHCP IPv4 domain name option.  While this option is less suitable, it
   still may be useful if the RFC 5986 option is not available.

   For IPv6, the ALTO server discovery procedure MUST try to retrieve
   DHCP option 57 (OPTION_V6_ACCESS_DOMAIN).  If no such option can be
   retrieved the procedure fails.  For IPv4, the ALTO server discovery
   procedure MUST try to retrieve DHCP option 213
   (OPTION_V4_ACCESS_DOMAIN).  If no such option can be retrieved, the
   procedure SHOULD try to retrieve option 15 (Domain Name).  If neither
   option can be retrieved the procedure fails.

   If a result can be retrieved it will be used as an input for the next
   step (U-NAPTR resolution).  One example could be:

3.2.  Step 2: U-NAPTR Resolution

   The ALTO protocol specification [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] expects that
   the ALTO discovery procedure yields the HTTP(S) URI of the ALTO
   server's Information Resource Directory, which gives further
   information about the capabilities and services provided by that ALTO
   server.  The first step of the ALTO server discovery procedure (see
   Section 3.1) yielded an U-NAPTR/DDDS (URI-Enabled NAPTR/Dynamic
   Delegation Discovery Service) [RFC4848] application unique strings,
   in the form of a DNS name.  An example is "example.com".

   In the second step, the ALTO Server discovery procedure needs to use
   the U-NAPTR [RFC4848] specification described below to obtain a URI
   (indicating host and protocol) for the ALTO server's Information
   Resource Directory.  In this document, only the HTTP and HTTPS URL
   schemes are defined, as the ALTO protocol specification defines the
   access over both protocols, but no other [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol].
   Note that the HTTP URL can be any valid HTTP(s) URL, including those
   containing path elements.

   The following two DNS entries show the U-NAPTR resolution for
   "example.com" to the HTTPS URL
   https://altoserver.example.com/secure/directory or the HTTP URL
   http://altoserver.example.com/directory, with the former being
   preferred.


       example.com.

       IN NAPTR 100  10   "u"    "ALTO:https"
            "!.*!https://altoserver.example.com/secure/directory!"  ""

       IN NAPTR 200  10   "u"    "ALTO:http"
            "!.*!http://altoserver.example.com/directory!"  ""

   There is a potential that retrieving the domain name or the U-NAPTR
   lookup itself does not yield to a result, i.e. no ALTO NAPTR record
   is found.  In this case the discovery procedure failed for this
   interface.  It is RECOMMENDED that clients give up the discovery
   process and wait a period of time before repeating the procedure.
   Clients MAY repeat the discovery procedure for a different interface
   instantaneously.

4.  Deployment Considerations

4.1.  Issues with Home Gateways

   Section 3.1.2 describes the usage of a DHCP option.  It enables the
   network operator of the network, in which the ALTO client is located,
   to provide a DNS suffix.  However, this assumes that this particular
   DHCP option is correctly passed from the DHCP server to the actual
   host with the ALTO client, and that the particular host understands
   this DHCP option.  This memo assumes the client to be able to
   understand the proposed DHCP option, otherwise there is no further
   use of the DHCP option, but the client has to use the other proposed
   mechanisms.

   There are well-known issues with the handling of DHCP options in home
   gateways.  One issue is that unkown DHCP options are not passed
   through some home gateways, effectively eliminating the DHCP option.

   Another well-known issues is the usage of home gateway specific DNS
   suffixes which "override" the DNS suffix provided by the network
   operator.  For instance, a host behind a home gateway may receive a
   DNS suffix ".local" instead of "example.com".  This suffix is not
   usuable for the server discovery procedure.

   In general, the ALTO server discovery SHOULD be based on the IP
   address that is used to communicate with other peers, i. e., it
   should return a server that can provide guidance for that address.

4.2.  Issues with Multihoming, Mobility and Changing IP Addresses

   If the user decides to enter the DNS suffix manually, only one set of
   ALTO servers will be discovered, irrespectively of multihoming and
   mobilility.  Particularly in mobile scenarios this can lead to
   undesirable results.

   The DHCP-based discovery method can discover different sets of ALTO
   servers for each interface and address familly (i.e., IPv4/v6).  In
   general, if a client wishes to communicate using one of its
   interfaces and using a specific IP address familiy, it SHOULD ask the
   ALTO server(s) for guidance that have been discovered for this
   specific interface and address family.  Selecting an interface and IP
   address family, as well as comparing results returned from different
   ALTO servers, is out of the scope of this document.

   A change of the IP address at an interface invalidates the result of
   the ALTO server discovery procedure.  For instance, if the IP address
   assigned to a mobile host changes due to host mobility, it is
   required to re-run the ALTO server discovery procedure without

   relying on earlier gained information.

   There are several challenges with DNS on hosts with multiple
   interfaces [RFC6418], which can affect the ALTO server discovery.  If
   the DNS resolution is performed on the wrong interface, it can return
   an ALTO server that could provide sub-optimal or wrong guidance.
   Finding the best ALTO server for multi-interfaced hosts is outside
   the scope of this document.

   When using Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections there is usually
   no DHCP.  The user has to enter the DNS suffix manually.  For good
   optimization results, a DNS suffix corresponding to the VPN
   concentrator, not corrsponding to the user's current location, has to
   be entered.  Similar considerations apply for Mobile IP.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  General

   There are two different failures for the ALTO server discovery, which
   can both be caused by malicious attacks or by configuration problems,
   e. g., in case of DNS configuration errors or multi-homed hosts.

   First, the discovery might not be able to discover an ALTO server,
   even if a suitable ALTO server exists.  In that case, ALTO guidance
   will not be used.  The resulting application performance and traffic
   distribution will correspond to a deployment scenario without ALTO
   guidance.  But given that users cannot rely on the availability of an
   ALTO server, this results in no significant additional security risk.

   Second, the discovery procedure may discover a sub-optimal or wrong
   ALTO server.  Such an ALTO server may either not be able to provide
   information for a given resource consumer (e. g., behind a NAT), thus
   rendering the ALTO service useless.  Alternatively, it may provide
   sub-optimal or forged information.  In the latter case, attackers
   could try to use ALTO to affect the traffic distribution or the
   performance of applications.  Users may then observe performance
   problems, and network operators could detect traffic anormalities.  A
   potential counter-measure is to disable the use of the ALTO service.

   Security issues of ALTO in general and potential solutions are also
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol].

6.2.  For U-NAPTR

   The address of an ALTO server is usually well-known within an access
   network; therefore, interception of messages does not introduce any
   specific concerns.

   The primary attack against the methods described in this document is
   one that would lead to impersonation of an ALTO server since a device
   does not necessarily have a prior relationship with an ALTO server.

   An attacker could attempt to compromise ALTO discovery at any of
   three stages:

   1.  providing a falsified domain name to be used as input to U-NAPTR

   2.  altering the DNS records used in U-NAPTR resolution

   3.  impersonation of the ALTO server

   This document focuses on the U-NAPTR resolution process and hence

Internet-Draft            ALTO Server Discovery            November 2012


   this section discusses the security considerations related to the DNS
   handling.  The security aspects of obtaining the domain name that is
   used for input to the U-NAPTR process is described in respective
   documents, such as [RFC5986].

   The domain name that is used to authenticated the ALTO server is the
   domain name in the URI that is the result of the U-NAPTR resolution.
   Therefore, if an attacker was able to modify or spoof any of the DNS
   records used in the DDDS resolution, this URI could be replaced by an
   invalid URI.  The application of DNS security (DNSSEC) [RFC4033]
   provides a means to limit attacks that rely on modification of the
   DNS records used in U-NAPTR resolution.  Security considerations
   specific to U-NAPTR are described in more detail in [RFC4848].

   An "https:" URI is authenticated using the method described in
   Section 3.1 of [RFC2818].  The domain name used for this
   authentication is the domain name in the URI resulting from U-NAPTR
   resolution, not the input domain name as in [RFC3958].  Using the
   domain name in the URI is more compatible with existing HTTP client
   software, which authenticate servers based on the domain name in the
   URI.
