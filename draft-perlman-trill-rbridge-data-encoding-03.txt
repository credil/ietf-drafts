                RBridges: TRILL Link Data Optimizations
           <draft-perlman-trill-rbridge-data-encoding-03.txt>


Abstract

   TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) Data frames can
   be encoded so as to make more efficient use of communications links
   under certain circumstances.  This document specifies two such
   optional optimizations.  One, called Compact Format, improves the
   compactness of encoding where a TRILL link is a point-to-point
   Ethernet link.  The other, called Specific Addressing, optionally
   decreases the burden on multi-access TRILL links for multi-
   destination TRILL Data frames. This document updates RFC 6325.

1. Introduction

   TRILL switches (also called RBridges (Routing Bridges)) are devices
   that support the IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of
   Links) protocol [RFC6325] [RFC6327] [ClearCorrect]. They provide
   transparent forwarding of frames in multi-hop networks with arbitrary
   topology and link technology using least cost paths for unicast
   traffic and support VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) and the
   multipathing of both unicast and multi-destination traffic. They
   accomplish this by use of a hop count and IS-IS (Intermediate System
   to Intermediate System) link state routing [IS-IS] [RFC1195]
   [RFC6326bis].

   A link between two TRILL switches in a TRILL campus can be any of a
   variety of technologies, ranging from a complex bridged LAN to PPP
   [RFC6361]. In the general case under the base TRILL protocol
   [RFC6325], a TRILL Data frame consists of an inner payload formatted
   as an Ethernet frame, preceded by a TRILL Header, and then
   encapsulated by a link envelope as appropriate for the link
   technology.



1.1 Structure of This Document

   Section 2 discusses General Format TRILL Data frames without the
   enhancements specified in this document.

   In the case where the link is a point-to-point Ethernet link, an
   optional Compact Format is possible for TRILL Data frames that saves
   16 bytes. Section 3 specifies that format, its processing, and the
   conditions for its safe use.

   In the case where a multi-destination TRILL Data frame is being
   forwarded over a multi-access link with multiple ports connected but
   there is only one (or perhaps a few) next hop TRILL switches of
   interest, optional Specific Addressing allows the TRILL Data frame to
   be link unicast. This can substantially reduce the burden that frame
   represents if, for example, the link is a complex bridged LAN through
   which the frame might otherwise be flooded.  Section 4 specifies the
   Specific Addressing enhancement and the conditions for its safe use.

   Section 5 discusses potential interaction between these two
   enhancements. The remaining Sections after Section 5 provide IANA and
   Security Considerations, References, and the like.

   This document updates [RFC6325].

1.2 Terminology Used in This Document

   The terminology and acronyms defined in [RFC6325] are used herein
   with the same meaning. In particular, the terms "campus", "native
   frame", "link", etc., are as defined [RFC6325].

   "Point-to-point", as used herein, means a link which appears to be an
   isolated channel between exactly two TRILL switch ports. Such a link
   may not include customer bridges but may include hubs/repeaters, Two
   Port MAC Relays, Provider Bridges, Provider Back Bone Bridges
   [802.1Q], or other technology, provided that technology is configured
   to provide a transparent point-to-point path between the end point
   RBridge ports.

   References herein to "VLAN Tag" or the like are to customer VLANs (C-
   Tags, Ethertype 0x8100). Use of S-Tags, also known as Service Tags,
   or stacked VLAN or other tags is beyond the scope of this document
   but is an obvious extension.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. The General TRILL Frame Format

   The subsections below provide a description of the general format of
   TRILL Data frames. It then narrows in to describe the format of TRILL
   Data frames on Ethernet links.



2.1 The General TRILL Frame Format

   The general "on-the-wire" form of TRILL frames is illustrated below.

   The Link Headers and Trailers in the formats below depend on the
   specific link technology. The Link Header contains one or more fields
   that distinguish TRILL Data from TRILL IS-IS. For example, over
   Ethernet, the TRILL Data Link Header ends with the TRILL Ethertype
   while the TRILL IS-IS frame Link Header ends with the L2-IS-IS
   Ethertype; on the other hand, over PPP, there are no Ethertypes but
   PPP protocol codes perform that function [RFC6361].

   A TRILL Data frame in transit between two neighboring RBridges is as
   shown below:

       +---------------+----------+----------------+---------------+
       | TRILL Data    |  TRILL   |    Payload     | TRILL Data    |
       | Link  Header  |  Header  |  Native Frame  | Link Trailer  |
       +---------------+----------+----------------+---------------+

                   Figure 1. Format of TRILL Data Frames

   In the above diagram, the Payload Native Frame is in a restricted
   Ethernet frame format with a VLAN tag but with no trailing Frame
   Check Sequence (FCS). The payload frame format is shown below,
   assuming the payload starts with an Ethertype (it might alternatively
   be LLC [802-2001] encoded or some other format):

         +-----------+------------+------+-----------+------------
         | MAC Dest. | MAC Source | VLAN | Content   | Content ...
         |   Address |    Address | Tag  | Ethertype |         ...
         +-----------+------------+------+-----------+------------

               Figure 2. Format of the Payload Native Frame

   The encapsulated payload has the following fields in sequence:

   o  A 6-byte destination MAC address (Inner.MacDA)

   o  A 6-byte source MAC address (Inner.MacSA)

   o  An Inner.VLAN tag giving the VLAN ID, Priority, and DEI (Drop


R. Perlman, et al                                               [Page 5]

      Eligibility Indicator) [ClearCorrect] of the payload (use of an S-
      tag or stacked tags is beyond the scope of this document but is an
      obvious extension)

   o  The payload frame's content (which usually starts with an
      Ethertype, such as the Ethertype for IPv4 or IPv6)

   TRILL IS-IS frames are also sent between neighboring RBridges and
   must be distinguished from TRILL Data frames. TRILL IS-IS frames are
   formatted as follows and cannot use the Compact Format specified
   herein:

              +--------------+---------------+--------------+
              | TRILL IS-IS  |  TRILL IS-IS  | TRILL IS-IS  |
              | Link Header  |    Payload    | Link Trailer |
              +--------------+---------------+--------------+

                        Figure 3. TRILL IS-IS Frame



2.2 Ethernet Link TRILL Data Frame General Encapsulation

   If the link between neighbor RBridges is Ethernet, then the general
   TRILL Data frame format has the following link encapsulation:

   Link Header: a 6-byte outer MAC destination address (Outer.MacDA)
         followed by a 6-byte outer MAC source address (Outer.MacSA)
         followed by an optional 4-byte outer VLAN tag Ethertype and
         value (Outer.VLAN), and finally the 2-byte TRILL Ethertype
         (0x22F3). Additional tags could be included after the outer MAC
         addresses and before the TRILL Ethertype based on Layer 2
         Ethernet functions such a MACSEC [802.1AE].

         Under the TRILL standard before this document, the Outer.MacDA
         was required to be the unicast MAC address of the destination
         RBridge port if the TRILL Data frame was a unicast frame to a
         known destination and was required to be the All-RBridges
         multicast address if it was a multi-destination frame.

            +-----------+------------+- - - - - +-----------+
            | MAC Dest. | MAC Source | VLAN Tag | TRILL     |
            |   Address |    Address |  if Req. | Ethertype |
            +-----------+------------+ - - - - -+-----------+

   In the General Format for Ethernet links, the Outer.VLAN can be
   omitted when it is not required by VLAN sensitive equipment in the
   link.

3. Compact Format for Point-to-Point Ethernet Links

   TRILL Data frames may optionally be sent using a Compact Format if
   the link is a point-to-point Ethernet link, Compact Format can be
   enabled by both RBridges on the link if other conditions met as
   listed below. 16 bytes can be saved per frame as a result.

   The Compact Format is simple: the Outer.MacDA, Outer.MacSA, and
   Outer.VLAN are replaced by the Inner.MacDA, Inner.MacSA, and
   Inner.VLAN and the Inner fields are deleted. This saves 6 + 6 + 4 or
   16 bytes. To avoid confusion, Compact Format MUST NOT be used if the
   Inner.MacDA is a multi-cast address assigned to TRILL
   (01-80-C2-00-00-40 through 01-80-C2-00-00-4F).

   Compact Format is not applicable to TRILL IS-IS frames because there
   is no inner Ethernet header. (And, of course, Compact Format is not
   applicable to native frames or Layer 2 control frames since those
   frames are not TRILL frames.)

     +---------------------+--------+-----------+---------+---------+
     | Ethernet Header     | TRILL  | Content   | Content | Link    |
     | Header from Payload | Header | Ethertype | ...     | Trailer |
     +---------------------+--------+-----------+---------+---------+

                 Figure 5. Compact Format TRILL Data Frame

   Compact Format is generally intended for use on physical point-to-
   point Ethernet links between RBridges, a common arrangement in many
   LANs. However, if there are any transparent provider bridging devices
   in the point-to-point link, such as Provider Bridges or Provider
   Backbone Bridges, then the use of the Compact Format will increase
   the MAC address learning table stress on such Provider Bridges or
   Provider Edge Back Bone bridges.



3.1 Conditions for Using Compact Format

   Use of Compact Format is a hop-by-hop decision. In successive RBridge
   to RBridge hops, a TRILL Data frame might be sent alternately in
   Compact Format and General Format.

   There are a number of conditions for using Compact Format TRILL Data
   frames. Most of these boil down to maximizing the assurance that the
   RBridge-to-RBridge Ethernet link over which the Compact Format TRILL
   Data frame is to be sent is really point-to-point. Only the General
   Format for TRILL Data frames is safe to use on an RBridge Ethernet
   port that is to a multi-access link even if the ports between which
   it is being sent have been configured as point-to-point ports.  The
   following conditions apply.  (See also the frame reception process


R. Perlman, et al                                               [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT                            TRILL: Link Data Optimizations


   variations described in Section 3.3.1.)

   o  The RBridge port over which Compact Format TRILL Data frames are
      to be sent MUST be configured as a point-to-point Ethernet port
      (see Section 4.9.1 of [RFC6325]).

   o  The RBridge port through which the Compact Format TRILL Data frame
      is being transmitted MUST be configured to send VLAN tagged
      frames.  Otherwise the VLAN of the payload may be lost.

   o  The RBridge port at the other end of the point-to-point link MUST
      be announcing that it supports the Compact Format. See Section
      3.4.

   o  Receipt of a native frame indicates that the link is multi-access
      and has end stations on it. These are frames that are not Layer 2
      control frames (see Section 1.4 of [RFC6325]) and have neither an
      Outer.MacDA in the block assigned to TRILL nor an outer payload
      EtherType assigned to/for TRILL (currently the TRILL and L2-IS-IS
      EtherTypes). On receipt of such a frame, the port MUST stop using
      Compact Format TRILL Data frames for at least ten seconds, unless
      it is reset by management or rebooted before that.

   o  Receipt of a TRILL IS-IS Hello frame, other than a point-to-point
      Hello from the RBridge believed to be at the other end of the
      link, indicates that the link really isn't point-to-point or that
      the RBridge at the other end of that link is mis-behaving. In
      either case, the RBridge receiving such an unexpected Hello MUST
      stop using Compact Format TRILL Data frames on that port for at
      least twice the holding time in the unexpected Hello but not less
      than ten seconds, unless it is reset by management or rebooted
      before that. This is a change to [RFC6325] which states that an
      RBridge port configured as point-to-point ignores TRILL Hellos.

   o  RBridge Ethernet ports are required to monitor ports for BPDUs
      received (Section 4.9.3 [RFC6325]). On receipt of a customer
      bridging BPDU at an RBridge port, the RBridge MUST stop using
      Compact Format on that port and revert to sending General Format
      TRILL Data frames for at least four times the Bridge Hello Time in
      the BPDU, but not less than ten seconds, unless the port or
      RBridge is reset by management or rebooted before that.

   o  It is RECOMMENDED that RBridge ports intending to use Compact
      Format also use the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) [802.1AB]
      to provide additional assurance that the link is actually point-
      to-point. For this use, LLDP should be run to the Nearest Customer
      Bridge MAC address (01-80-C2-00-00-00). Receipt by an RBridge port
      supporting LLDP of an LLDP message indicating the presence on the
      link of a MAC Bridge, Layer 3 Router, or End Station indicates
      that the link is not point-to-point and the RBridge MUST stop


R. Perlman, et al                                               [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT                            TRILL: Link Data Optimizations


      using Compact Format on the port for at least twice the TTL in the
      received LLDP frame but not less than ten second, unless the port
      or RBridge is reset by management or rebooted before that.



3.2 RBridge Originated and Terminated Native Frames

   There can be native frames originated by or intended for consumption
   by an RBridge. Examples include SNMP over IP frames or RBridge
   Channel frames [RFCchannel]. In many cases, such internal sinks and
   sources of native frames are treated as a virtual end-station
   internally attached to the RBridge. Such frames are converted to
   TRILL Data frames before being transmitted outside the originating
   RBridge.

   Because of the way that Compact Format TRILL Data frames are
   recognized, particularly the change in [RFC6325], Section 4.6.2,
   Point 3, made by Section 3.3.1 of this document, an RBridge MUST use
   a MAC address different from the address of any of its ports as the
   Inner.MacSA of frames it locally originates and as the Inner.MacDA it
   expects to see in unicast TRILL Data frames that it receives and
   decapsulates for locally processing.



3.3 Compact TRILL Data Reception and Transmission

   If an RBridge's Ethernet port has Compact Format enabled, frame
   reception and transmission are modified as described below.

   Section 4.6 of the TRILL base protocol standard [RFC6325] provides a
   specification of the processing of all possible types of received
   frames. There is no change in the definition of TRILL frames as
   specified in [RFC6325] Section 1.4, that is, TRILL frames are any
   frame starting with the TRILL or L2-IS-IS Ethertype or that has an
   Outer.MacDA that is any of the block of 16 multicast addresses
   assigned to TRILL ([RFC6325] Section 7.2).



3.3.1 Compact TRILL Data Frame Reception

   Section 4.6.2 of [RFC6325] specifies the processing of received TRILL
   frames. A complete replacement for Section 4.6.2 of [RFC6325] that
   supports Compact Format and incorporates the correction in Section
   5.1.2 of [ClearCorrect] is provided in the quoted text below.

   Even when Compact Format is enabled, the sender is not required to
   compact all or any TRILL Data frames and a receiver MUST be prepared


R. Perlman, et al                                              [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT                            TRILL: Link Data Optimizations


   for an arbitrary mix of Compact Format and General Format TRILL Data
   frames arriving on a point-to-point link.

   NOTE: All of the Section references in the quoted text below are
   references to Sections in [RFC6325].

      "A TRILL frame either has the TRILL or L2-IS-IS Ethertype or has a
      multicast Outer.MacDA allocated to TRILL (see Section 7.2).  The
      following tests are performed sequentially, and the first that
      matches controls the handling of the frame:"

      "By default a frame is classified as General Format."

       "1. If the Ethertype is L2-IS-IS and the Outer.MacDA is either
           All-IS-IS-RBridges or the unicast MAC address of the
           receiving RBridge port, the frame is handled as described in
           Section 4.6.2.1 on TRILL Control frames."

       "2. If the Outer.MacDA is a multicast address allocated to TRILL
           other than All-RBridges then the frame is discarded."

       "3. If the Outer.MacDA is a unicast address other than the
           address of the receiving Rbridge then (3a) if Compact Format
           TRILL Data frames are disabled, the frame is discarded or
           (3b) if Compact Format TRILL Data frames are enabled, the
           frame is classified as compact."

       "4. If the Ethertype is not TRILL, the frame is discarded."

       "5. If the Version field in the TRILL Header is greater than 0,
           the frame is discarded."

       "6. If the hop count is 0, the frame is discarded."

       "7. If the Outer.MacDA is multicast and the M bit is zero the
           frame is discarded.  If the Outer.MacDA is unicast and M bit
           is one processing continues if Specific Addressing is
           enabled. If Specific Addressing is not enabled, the frame is
           discarded."

       "8. If the frame has been classified as Compact Format, skip the
           rest of this rule and go to Rule 9. By default, an RBridge
           MUST discard General Format TRILL Data frames from a
           Outer.MacSA that is not an adjacency on the port where the
           frame was received. RBridges MAY be configured per port to
           accept such frames in cases where it is known that a non-
           peering device (such as an end-station) is configured to
           originate general TRILL encapsulated data frames that can be

           frame but it was received untagged, that is, without an
           Outer.VLAN, discard the frame."

           frame has been classified as Compact Format, all references
           to Inner.MacDA, Inner.MacSA, or Inner.VLAN are to be
           understood to actually refer to the Outer.MacDA, Outer.MacSA,
           and Outer.VLAN as the frame was received."

      "11. The Inner.MacDA is then tested. If it is the All-Egress-

           and RBn implements the ESADI protocol, processing proceeds as
           in Section 4.6.2.2 for TRILL ESADI frames. If it is any other
           address or RBn does not implement ESADI, processing proceeds
           as in Section 4.6.2.3 for TRILL Data frames."



3.3.2 Compact TRILL Data Frame Transmission

   When a TRILL Data frame is being transmitted out an RBridge port, if
   the conditions listed in Section 3 above are met, the frame MAY be
   sent in Compact Format.



3.4 Announcing Support for Compact Format

   The Compact Format option is a hop-by-hop optional Ethernet link
   TRILL frame format and it is possible that an RBridge would support
   it on some ports and not others depending, for example, on port
   hardware. Therefore, if Compact Format is enabled at a port, this is
   indicated in every Hello (Section 6) it sends out that port.

4. Specific Addressing

   Specific addressing optionally enables more efficient use of some
   types of multi-access links.



4.1 Current Multi-Destination Addressing

   When multiple RBridges are connected to an Ethernet link, the base
   TRILL protocol standard [RFC6325] requires that multi-destination
   TRILL Data frames be sent on the Ethernet link addressed to the All-
   RBridges multicast address.

   If the link is a multi-access link, such as a large bridged LAN, use
   of a multicast address may impose a significant burden, causing the
   frame to be flooded in the bridged LAN. In addition, all or many
   stations attached to the bridged LAN may received the frame using up
   some of their input bandwidth. Those TRILL switches that receive the
   frame but are not the next hop on the frame's distribution tree will
   discard the frame due to the Reverse Path Forwarding Check.



4.2 Specific Addressing Specification

   Multi-destination TRILL Data frames are sent on the distribution tree
   identified in the TRILL Header subject to optional pruning. The
   transmitting RBridge thus knows which next hop RBridge or RBridges on
   the link it needs to get the frame to.

   If the next hop RBridges on the multi-access link and the
   transmitting RBridge all have Specific Addressing enabled, then the
   frame MAY be link unicast to the next hop RBridge or RBridges.

   Use of Specific Addressing is a hop-by-hop optional decision.
   Successive TRILL Data frames received by an RBridge, even from the
   same sending RBridge on the same distribution tree, may be
   specifically (unicast) or multicast addressed. (The same frame is
   never sent both ways.) In successive RBridge to RBridge hops, a
   multi-destination TRILL Data frame might be sent alternately in
   specifically addressed and multicast addressed form.



4.3 Announcing Support for Specific Addressing

   The Specific Addressing option is a hop-by-hop optional format. It is
   possible that an RBridge would support it on some ports and not
   others. Therefore enablement of this option is indicated in every

INTERNET-DRAFT                            TRILL: Link Data Optimizations


5. Interaction Between The Optimizations

   Compact Format can only be used for TRILL Data frames on Ethernet
   links that are point-to-point. Compact Format works under the
   conditions specified above regardless of whether the frame is TRILL
   unicast (M=0) or TRILL multi-destination (M=1). It sets the
   Outer.MacDA, Outer.MacSA, and Outer.VLAN to the corresponding Inner
   fields and removes the Inner fields.

   Specific Addressing is only beneficial for frames that are TRILL
   multi-destination Data frames on multi-access links. Specific
   Addressing causes the frame to be link unicast by setting the
   Outer.MacDA to the unicast address of a next hop RBridge.

   Both optimizations change the Outer.MacDA from its value in the base
   TRILL protocol and thus they conflict. Specific Addressing MUST NOT
   be used on point-to-point Ethernet links, which avoids any conflict.

   IANA is requested to allocate two capability bits in the TRILL-PORT-
   VER sub-TLV [RFC6326bis] as follows:

      tbd2   Specific addressing enabled.   (This document)

7. Security Considerations

   For general TRILL protocol security considerations, see [RFC6325].
   See other security considerations below.



7.1 Compact Format Security Considerations

   An RBridge conformant to the TRILL standard that has Compact Format
   TRILL Data not implemented or not enabled on a port will, as part of
   its normal procedures, discard any Compact Format TRILL Data frame it
   receives on that port because the EtherType of the frame would be
   TRILL but (1) if the Compact Format resulted in a unicast
   Outer.MacDA, it would not be the address of the receiving RBridge
   port, and (2) if the Compact Format resulted in a multicast or
   broadcast Outer.MacDA, it would not be the All-RBridges multicast
   address. If the RBridge port failed to discard the frame and
   erroneously handled it as being in General Format, bad things will
   usually happen as described in Section 7.3.

   With a General Format TRILL Data frame, the VLAN of the data is
   somewhat protected in the Inner.VLAN field. With Compact Format, it
   is put in the more exposed Outer.VLAN field. If it is stripped,
   perhaps by an intervening bridge, and the frame arrives untagged, the
   rules in this document require that it be discarded to avoid changing
   the VLAN labeling of the frame to the default of the receiving
   RBridge port.



7.2 Specific Addressing Security Considerations

   It is important not to apply both Compact Format optimization and
   Specific Addressing optimization to the same frame or else the frame
   may be misinterpreted as described in Section 7.3.  For this reasons,
   use of Specific Addressing on point-to-point links, where it would
   not provide an advantage anyway, is prohibited.



7.3 Results of Frame Misinterpretation

   For frames that are misinterpreted due to circumstances described in
   Sections 7.1 and 7.2, the first six bytes of the native frame content
   will be treated as the Inner.MacDA, the next six bytes of that oontnt
   as the Inner.MacSA, and the next four bytes as the Inner.VLAN. If the
   Ethertype or the Inner.VLAN is not checked or some of the payload
   data accidentally has the value of a VLAN tag Ethertype, the payload
   may be delivered in the wrong VLAN violating security policy. For

   this reason, the provisions of Sections 3 of this document should be
   scrupulously enforced.
