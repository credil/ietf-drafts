<section title="Introduction">
  <t>
   The Ethernet-based xDSL Multi-Pair Bonding, a.k.a. G.Bond/Ethernet,
   is specified in ITU-T G.998.2 recommendation
   <xref target="G.998.2"/>, which defines a method for bonding
   (or aggregating) of multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer
   channels in multiple xDSL lines) into a single
   bi-directional logical link, carrying an Ethernet traffic.
  </t>
  <t>
   The MIB module, defined in this document, provides G.Bond/Ethernet
   specific objects for the management of G.998.2 bonded interfaces,
   extending the common bonding objects specified in GBOND-MIB
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib"/> module.

   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to
   section 7 of RFC 3410 <xref target="RFC3410"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
   termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are
   generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
   (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
   defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This
   memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which
   is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 <xref target="RFC2578"/>,
   STD 58, RFC 2579 <xref target="RFC2579"/> and STD 58, RFC
   2580 <xref target="RFC2580"/>.

<section title="The Broadband Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding">
  <t>
   This document makes use of the Broadband Forum technical report
   Management Framework for xDSL Bonding <xref target="TR-159"/>,
   defining a management model and a hierarchy of management objects
   for the bonded xDSL interfaces. 
  </t>
</section>

<section title="Relation to other MIB modules">
 <t>
   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed:
   Interfaces Group MIB (IF-MIB), G.Bond MIB (GBOND-MIB), and EFM Copper
   MIB (EFM-CU-MIB).
  </t>
  <section title="Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB module">
    <t>
     A G.Bond/Ethernet port is a private case of a bonded multi-pair xDSL
     interface and as such is managed using generic interface management
     objects defined in the IF-MIB <xref target="RFC2863"/>. In
     particular, an interface index (ifIndex) is used to index instances of
     G.Bond/Ethernet ports, as well as xDSL lines/channels, in a managed
     system.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Relationship to G.Bond MIB module">
    <t>
     GBOND-MIB <xref target="I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib"/> module
     defines management objects common for all bonded multi-pair
     xDSL interfaces. In particular it describes the bonding management,
     bonded port and channel configuration, handshake-based discovery,
     initialization sequence etc.
    </t>
    <t>
     Both GBOND-MIB and G9982-MIB modules are REQUIRED to manage
     a G.Bond/Ethernet port.
    </t>
    <section title="BACP-based Discovery">
     <t>
      All G.998 protocols share a remote Bonding Channel Entity (BCE)
      discovery, using the <xref target="G.994.1"/> handshake (G.hs).
      The GBOND-MIB module provides an example of an automatic BCE
      connection to the corresponding Generic Bonding Sublayer (GBS)
      ports of a generic G.998 multi-port Central Office (CO) device,
      using the G.hs-based BCE discovery.
      Amendment 2 to the ITU-T G.998.2 specification
      <xref target="G.998.2-Amd2"/>, provides an alternative optional
      Bonding Aggregation Control Protocol (BACP) for in-service discovery,
      aggregation and pair management.
     </t>
     <t>
      The following pseudo-code gives the same example of the discovery
      and automatic BCE assignment for a multi-GBS G.Bond/Eth CO device,
      using BACP objects defined in this MIB module, IF-CAP-STACK-MIB and
      IF-MIB modules
      [Note that automatic BCE assignment is only shown here for the
      purposes of the example.
      Fixed BCE pre-assignment, manual assignment or auto-assignment
      using an alternative internal algorithm may be chosen by a
      particular implementation]: 
     </t>

          // for GBS[i] and there room for another BCE in the
          // GBS[i] aggregation group (max. Bonding capacity is
          // not reached yet).
          // Connect this BCE to the GBS (via ifStackTable,
          // ifInvStackTable being inverse of ifStackTable is

          // to ifInvStackTable[bce[j]])
          ADD bce[j] TO ifStackTable[gbs[i]];
          gbs[i].NumBCEs = gbs[i].NumBCEs + 1;
        }
      }
      // At this point we have discovered all local BCEs which
      // are physically connected to the same remote RT_device
      // and connected them to GBS[i]. Go to the next GBS.

    <t>
     An SNMP Agent for a G.Bond device builds ifCapStackTable
     and its inverse ifInvCapStackTable on device initialization, according to
     the cross-connect capabilities of the device. When BACP is used,
     the g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID object identifying bonding
     eligibility MUST be automatically updated, whenever
     the ifCapStackTable/ifInvCapStackTable are changed.
    </t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section title="Relationship to EFM Copper MIB module">
    <t>
     EFM-CU-MIB <xref target="RFC5066"/> module
     defines objects for managing Ethernet in the First Mile Copper
     (EFMCu) interfaces 10PASS-TS and 2BASE-TL, defined in
     IEEE Std 802.3-2005 <xref target="802.3"/>. These interfaces are
     based on Single-pair High-speed Digital Subscriber Line (SHDSL)
     <xref target="G.991.2"/> and Very High speed Digital Subscriber
     Line (VDSL) <xref target="G.993.1"/> technology respectively, and
     can be optionally aggregated (bonded).
    </t>
    <t>
     ITU-T G.998.2 specification extends the IEEE 802.3 Clause 61
     bonding to work over any xDSL technology, providing the ability
     to bond individual channels as well as physical lines. It also
     allows the use of alternative HDLC encapsulation instead of the default
     64/65-octet encapsulation and adds a new optional Bonding Aggregation
     Control Protocol (BACP) for in-service discovery, aggregation
     and pair management instead of the default
     G.hs-based bonding protocol, which cannot be used
     in-service, while the link is up.
   </t>
    <t>
     EFM-CU-MIB can be used to manage all aspects of the EFMCu
     physical interfaces (PHYs), including a complete (within the
     scope of the 802.3 standard) management of the SHDSL/VDSL lines.
     GBOND-MIB and G9982-MIB modules on the other hand, provide
     management objects only for the bonding part, leaving the management
     of the individual xDSL interfaces (lines/channels) to the
     respective xDSL-LINE-MIB modules.
    </t>
    <t>
     Therefore an IEEE 802.3 2BASE-TL/10PASS-TS interface can be
     managed by either combination of the following MIB modules:
     <list>
       <t>
        IF-MIB + IF-CAP-STACK-MIB + EtherLike-MIB + MAU-MIB + EFM-CU-MIB
       </t>
       <t>
        IF-MIB + IF-CAP-STACK-MIB + GBOND-MIB + G9982-MIB + HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB/VDSL-LINE-MIB
       </t>
     </list>
    </t>
    <t>
     Note also that while EFM-CU-MIB relies on ifMauMediaAvailable
     object from MAU-MIB <xref target="RFC4836"/> for the additional
     bonded xDSL-specific operational states, GBOND-MIB provides these
     indication via gBondPortStatOperStatus object, complementing the
     ifOperStatus object from IF-MIB.
    </t>
    <t>
     Finally, EFM-CU-MIB does not include historical Performance
     Monitoring (PM), while GBOND-MIB/GBOND-MIB-ETH/xDSL-LINE-MIB
     combination provides
     full PM functionality for a bonded link and individual xDSL lines.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Relationship to IEEE 802.3.1 MIB modules">
    <t>
     The IEEE 802.3 working group chartered a task force
     <xref target="IEEE802.3.1"/>, which continues the development of
     standard Ethernet-related MIB modules based on the initial work
     done in the IETF. 
     Future projects resulting from the work of this Task Force may
     include and possibly extend the work done in the IETF.
   </t>
  </section>

</section>

<section title="MIB Structure">
  <section title="Overview">
    <t>
     The main management objects defined in the G9982-MIB module
     are split into 2 groups, structured as recommended by RFC 4181
     <xref target="RFC4181"/>:
     <list style="symbols">
       <t>
        g9982Port - containing objects for configuration,
        capabilities, status and PM of G.Bond/Eth ports. Note that the
        rest of the objects for the Generic Bonded Sub-layer (GBS) port
        configuration, capabilities, status, notifications and PM, is located in
        the GBOND-MIB module.
       </t>
       <t>
        g9982Bce - containing objects representing OPTIONAL status 
        information and BACP configuration for each Bonding Channel Entity (BCE).
        Note that the rest of the objects for the BCE configuration, capabilities,
        status and notifications, is located in relevant xDSL line MIB modules as
        well as in the GBOND-MIB module.
       </t>
     </list>
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Performance Monitoring">
    <t>
     The OPTIONAL performance monitoring counters, thresholds and history
     buckets (interval-counters), similar to those defined in
     <xref target="TR-159"/>
     are implemented using the textual conventions defined in the
     HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB <xref target="RFC3705"/>. The
     HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB defines 64-bit versions of the textual
     conventions found in PerfHist-TC-MIB <xref target="RFC3593"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
     The agent SHOULD align the beginning of each interval to a fifteen
     minute boundary of a wall clock. Likewise, the beginning of each
     one day intervals SHOULD be aligned with the start of a day.
    </t>
    <t>
     Counters are not reset when a GBS is reinitialized, but rather only
     when the agent is reset or reinitialized.

     Note that some of the mapping between the objects defined in TR-159
     and the ones defined in this MIB module is not one-to-one, for example,
     while TR-159 PM attributes aGroupPerf* map to the corresponding
     gBondPortPm* objects of the GBOND-MIB module, there are no dedicated
     PM attributes for the g9982PortPm* objects introduced in this
     MIB module. However, since their definition is identical to the
     definition of gBondPortPm* objects of the GBOND-MIB module, we
     can map g9982PortPm* to the relevant aGroupPerf* attributes
     of TR-159 and use the term 'partial mapping' to denote the fact
     that this mapping is not one-to-one.

       have the same g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID on a system, they
       are eligible to be aggregated on that system. Typically, all
       BCEs on a BTU-R device would be assigned the same
       g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID, to assert that all of the BCEs
       should be in the same bonded group. BCEs with different
       g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID values MUST NOT be connected to
       the same GBS.
       BCEs with the same g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID MAY be
       connected to different GBS ports.
       This object MUST be instantiated during BACP initialization,
       when every BCE belongs to its own GBS. Attempts to change this
       object MUST be rejected (with the error inconsistentValue),
       if the BCE is aggregated with other BCEs, i.e. more than one BCE
       is connected to the same GBS, or if the BCE in question is not
       eligible to be bonded with other BCEs having the same value
       (e.g. the bonding is limited to a single Line Card and BCEs are
       located on the different Line Cards, or BCEs are the channels of
       the same line).

       Note that bonding eligibility is reflected in the
       ifCapStackTable and its inverse ifInvCapStackTable, and as such
       any modification of g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID MUST be
       reflected in these tables.

<section title="Security Considerations">
<!--
  See https://svn.tools.ietf.org/area/ops/trac/wiki/mib-security
  for the latest recommended boilerplate text
-->
  <t>
   There is a number of managed objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations. These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   <list style='symbols'>
    <t>
     Changing of g9982PortConfTable configuration parameters
     (e.g. g9982PortConfTcAdminType) may lead to a complete service
     interruption, in case the specified PTM-TC encapsulation type
     is not supported by the remote end.
    </t>
    <t>
     Changing of g9982BceConfTable configuration parameters
     (e.g. g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID) may lead to preventing a
     non-bonded BCE from being bonded in any bonding group or false
     advertisement of bonding eligibility (e.g. between BCEs residing on
     different line cards in an application which does not support
     cross-card bonding).
    </t>
   </list>
  </t>
  <t>
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments since, collectively, they provide
   information about the performance of network interfaces and can reveal
   some aspects of their configuration.
  </t>
  <t>
   It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these
   objects and possibly even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
   them over the network via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
   <list style='symbols'>
    <t>
     g9982PortStatTable - objects in this table
     (e.g. g9982PortStatTcOperType) provide status information
     for the G.Bond port, which may aid in deciphering of the
     G.Bond/ETH transmissions.
    </t>
   </list>
  </t>
  <t>
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.
  </t>
  <t>
   Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"/>), including full
   support for authentication and privacy via the User-based Security
   Model (USM) <xref target="RFC3414"/> with the AES cipher algorithm
   <xref target="RFC3826"/>.
   Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model
   (TSM) <xref target="RFC5591"/> in combination with a secure transport such
   as SSH <xref target="RFC5592"/> or TLS/DTLS <xref target="RFC6353"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
