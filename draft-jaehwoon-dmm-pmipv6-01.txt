                 PMIPv6-based Distributed Mobility Management

Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is the network-based mobility management
   protocol where access network supports the mobility of a mobile node
   on behalf of the MN. In PMIPv6, the location information of the MN 
   should be registered to Localized Mobility Anchor and communication 
   must be established via the LMA. Therefore, the performance can be 
   degraded due to traffic concentration and congestion possibility. 
   One method to overcome the above problems is to exploit the 
   distributed mobility management (DMM) mechanism to distribute the 
   LMA function to all access routers within the PMIPv6 domain. This 
   letter proposes the fully distributed mobility management mechanism 
   in PMIPv6-based network. In this mechanism, there is no need for 
   the location management function to register the location of the MN. 
   Therefore, the performance is not degraded due to the overhead to 
   query the location of the MN.

1.  Introduction


   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) defines a protocol that allows a mobile node (MN) 
   to maintain connectivity with a correspondent node (CN) within the 
   Internet while changing its point of attachment [1]. In MIPv6, an MN 
   is assigned with an IPv6 address as the home address, and a home 
   agent (HA) is defined as the mobility agent that has the same 
   network address as that of the home address of the MN. Whenever an 
   MN visits a foreign network, it is assigned with a care-of address 
   (CoA) and registers its home address and the CoA to its HA by using 
   the Binding Update (BU) message. After that, the tunnel is 
   established between the MN and the HA, and the MN can communicate 
   with any host within the Internet. MIPv6 is considered as the host-
   based mobility management protocol that an MN initiates the 
   operation defined in the MIPv6 whenever the MN detects that it 
   changes the point of attachment.
   
   Even though the MIPv6 is defined as the Internet standard, the 
   overhead to run the MIPv6 in an MN is not small. Proxy MIPv6 (PMIPv6)
   is standardized as an Internet standard where access networks within 
   the PMIPv6 domain support the mobility of an MN on behalf of the MN 
   [2]. In PMIPv6, a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) is defined to support 
   the mobility of an MN. The MAG acts as the default gateway of the 
   access link to which an MN is connected. Moreover, the Localized 
   Mobility Anchor (LMA) is defined as the home agent of an MN within 
   the PMIPv6 domain. In PMIPv6, every MAG advertises the same network 
   prefix to an MN so that the MN considers that it connects to the 
   same network while the MN moves one network to another. The MAG that 
   the MN connects transmits the Proxy BU (PBU) message with its 
   address (that is, Proxy-CoA) and the information of the MN to the 
   LMA and establishes the tunnel between itself and the LMA in order 
   for the MN to maintain the pre-established session.
   
   MIPv6 and PMIPv6 use one centralized agent such as HA and LMA, 
   respectively. Such centralized functions have several problems such 
   as single-node failure, congestion possibility, scalability issues 
   and non-optimal routes [3]. One method to resolve such problems is 
   to use the dynamic mobility management (DMM) mechanism to distribute 
   mobile agent function to access routers [4]. Especially, in PMIPv6, 
   access networks need to support the mobility of MNs in order for an 
   MN to use the pre-assigned address and to maintain the pre-
   established session. One method to provide the DMM in PMIPv6 domain 
   is to distribute the LMA function to every MAG. Here, a MAG that an 
   MN enters the PMIPv6 domain and firstly connects becomes the LMA for 
   the MN. Moreover, the MAG becomes the default gateway for the MN.    

   That is, LMA function can be distributed because different MNs 
   firstly connect to different MAGs and different MAGs become different 
   LMAs for different MNs. Moreover, because the access router to which

   an MN firstly connects provides the MAG and LMA functions, optimal 
   path can be established between the MN and a CN. However, PMIPv6 
   domain should support the mobility of an MN on behalf of the MN. When 
   an MN moves one network to another, a new access router that the MN 
   moves and connects should know (1) whether the MN firstly enters the 
   PMIPv6 domain and (2) the address information of the LMA for the MN 
   when the access router knows that the MN moves from another network. 
   One way to do it is to use the partial DMM mechanism [5-7]. The 
   partial DMM mechanism in PMIPv6 environment defines a Location 
   Management Function (LMF). A MAG that an MN firstly enters the PMIPv6 
   domain and firstly connects becomes the LMA for the MN. The LMA
   registers its address and MN's ID with the LMF. When the MN moves and 
   connects to a different MAG, the MAG queries the address information 
   of the MN and LMA, and establishes the tunnel with the LMA. After 
   that, the MN can continue to communicate any host within the 
   Internet. However, there can also occur single-node failure problem. 
   Moreover, control messages to query the LMA address information for 
   MNs are concentrated to the LMF, which occurs the congestion 
   possibility.
   
   In this draft, we propose the fully distributed mobility management 
   mechanism. The proposed mechanism does not need the control function 
   such as LMF. Therefore, it does not occur the single-node failure 
   problem. Moreover, the performance degradation does not occur due to 
   the overhead to register and query the LMA address information for 
   an MN.

                  Figure 1: Message exchange scenario


   The message exchange procedure between network entities to provide 
   fully distributed mobility management in PMIPv6 environment proposed 
   in this draft is presented in Figure 1. A network prefix "PREF" is 
   allocated to the PMIPv6 domain. However, a different sub-network 
   prefix belonging to the same network prefix "PREF" is allocated to 
   a different MAG in PMIPv6 domain. In the example of Fig. 1, a sub-
   network prefix "PREF1" belonging to "PREF" is allocated to MAG1 
   and a different sub-network prefix "PREF2" belonging to the same 
   "PREF" is allocated to MAG2. Even though a different sub-network 
   prefix is allocated to a different MAG, all MAGs advertise the same 
   network prefix "PREF" through the interfaces providing PMIPv6 
   service.

   When an MN firstly enters the PMIPv6 domain and connects to a MAG 
   (say, MAG1), MAG1 transmits to the MN a Router Advertisement (RA) 
   message by setting "M (Managed address configuration)" flag in 
   order to configure an address to the MN by using the stateful 
   address configuration method [9]. The network prefix "PREF" is set

   to the prefix option information field in the RA message. The MN 
   receiving the RA message transmits the dynamic host configuration 
   protocol (DHCP) request message to the MAG1 [10]. The MAG1 considers 
   that the MN firstly connects to the PMIPv6 domain and transmits the 
   DHCP response message containing an address belonging to the 
   "PREF1" to the MN. The MN sets the address contained in the DHCP 
   response message to its interface. After that, the MN can 
   communicate to a CN within the Internet.

   When the MN moves MAG1 to MAG2 while communicating with a CN, the 
   MAG1 begins to perform the LMA function for the MN and stores 
   packets sent from the CN into the buffer. The MAG1 stores the MM's
   information into its Binding Cache Entry (BCE). When the MN connects 
   to MAG2, the MAG2 transmits the RA message containing network prefix 
   set to "PREF" to the MN. The MN receiving the RA message considers 
   that it connects to the same network by using the "PREF" network 
   prefix in prefix information option of RA message. It continues to 
   use the address configured previously and transmits IP packets as 
   usual. MAG2 checks the first packet transmitted by the MN. If the 
   first packet contains the DHCP request packet, then MAG2 considers 
   that the MN firstly connects to the PMIPv6 domain. Otherwise, MAG2 
   considers that the MN moves from another MAG area and creates the 
   Binding Update List (BUL) for the MN. And then, MAG2 transmits the 
   Distributed Proxy Binding Update (DPBU) message. The source address 
   of the packet containing the DPBU message is set to the address of 
   the MAG2 (say, Proxy-CoA2) and the destination address is set to the 
   address of the MN. Here, MAG2 can know the address of the MN by 
   using the source address of the IP packet sent by the MN. Moreover, 
   MAG2 stores packets sent by the MN. DPBU message is transmitted to 
   the MAG1 through the Internet topologically correct routing path. 
   MAG1 receiving the DPBU message stores the Proxy-CoA2 address to its 
   BCE for the MN, establishes the tunnel with MAG2, and transmits the 
   Distributed Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (DPBA) message to MAG2. 
   The source and destination addresses of the packet containing the 
   DPBA message are set to the address of MAG1 (say, Proxy-CoA1) and 
   Proxy-CoA2, respectively. The DPBA message contains the address of 
   the MN in its option field. MAG2 receiving the PBA message stores 
   the Proxy-CoA1 address to its BUL and establishes the tunnel with 
   MAG1. And then, MAG2 transmits the packets stored in the buffer. 
   After that, the MN continues to communicate with the CN.
