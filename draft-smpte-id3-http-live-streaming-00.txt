	     SMPTE-TT Embedded in ID3 for HTTP Live Streaming
		  draft-smpte-id3-http-live-streaming-00

Abstract

   This document describes how the subtitle feature for different 
   languages can be achievable in HTTP Live Streaming output streams. 
   In order to achieve the goal, SMPTE-TT XML files are used to embed 
   into the ID3 tag with user defined languages and text information 
   stored in multiple frames.

1.  Introduction

   Apple HTTP Live Streaming supports inclusion of timed metadata in 
   ID3 format, carried in an elementary stream (PES) of MPEG-2 
   transport stream. The metadata stream will be in the same program as
   the main program containing video/audio content. 
   
   Based on this mechanism, the SMPTE-TT XML files containing subtitle 
   images are tagged by the ID3 tag and are embedded as timed metadata 
   in TS segments according to the Apple HLS Metadata Specification. 


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation   
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.


3.  ID3 Tag
   
   The ID3 Tag [ID3] contains the description of the subtitle and the 
   content of SMPTE-TT XML files. The user defined text information 
   frame (TXXX) defined in (ID3 tag version 2.3.0) is used when tagging 
   the content.

3.1.  User Defined Text Information Frame

   The SMPTE-TT XML files containing subtitle images are stored in a 
   complete "User Defined Text Information Frame" (TXXX).
   
   The following attributes are defined:
   
   FRAME HEADER
   The value is ID3 Frame header.

   TEXT ENCODING
   The value is the text encoding byte. It denotes the text encoding 
   used to encode the DESCRIPTION and VALUE field.

   DESCRIPTION
   The description contains Track Name and Language Descriptor in a 
   text string encoded according to TEXT ENCODING. Track Name refers to 
   a unique identifier of closed caption. Language Descriptor is used 
   according ISO639-1.

Internet-Draft						      June 2012


   E.g. If Track Name = 1, Language Descriptor = eng, the description 
   would be Track:1,Lang:eng.

   VALUE
   The value is SMPTE-TT XML encoded according to TEXT ENCODING.
   

4.  Presentation Time of Temporal Structuring Element in SMPTE-TT

   Temporal structures in SMPTE-TT contain the time information in XML 
   attributes using timeExpression [W3C-TTML-1.0]. The timeExpression

   MUST be interpreted as relative to the presentation time of 
   containing the ID3 Tag.

6.  Security Considerations

   Since the protocol relies on HTTP Live Streaming, most of the same 
   security considerations apply. See section 11 of draft-pantos-http-
   live-streaming-08.
   
7.  IANA Considerations

   Same IANA considerations of HTTP Live Streaming apply. See section 10 
   of draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-08.
