     RSVP-TE Extensions to Notification for Shared Mesh Protection
         draft-he-ccamp-notification-shared-mesh-protection-00

Abstract

   The shared mesh protection(SMP) mechanism enables multiple protection
   paths within a shared mesh protection domain to share protection
   resources, which allows only one of the n working paths to be
   protected at the same time.  This document extends RSVP-TE to notify
   the state of shared resources in MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
   mesh topology.

Internet-Draft   Notification for shared mesh protection       July 2011


1.  Introduction

   In mesh protection, network resources may be shared to provide
   protection for working paths that do not share the same endpoints.
   This form of protection can make very efficient use of network
   resources, but requires careful synchronization to ensure that only
   one set of traffic is switched to the protection resources at any
   time.

   [RFC4872] defines the shared mesh restoration schemes based on
   control plane extensions, but does not cover the shared mesh
   protection scenarios.

   In order to coordinate the use of protection resources, this document
   specifies the notification schemes to notify the endpoint of the
   protecting LSP the state of the shared resource.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.


3.  Shared Mesh Protection

   Consider the following topology:


                                       A---B---C---D
                                       \          /
                                        E---F---G
                                       /         \
                                       H---I---J---K


               Figure 1 : A Shared Mesh Protection Topology

   The working LSPs W1[via nodes A,B,C,D] and W2[via nodes H,I,J,K]
   could be protected by P1[via nodes A,E,F,G,D] and P2[via nodes
   H,E,F,G,K]respectively.  For both cases, 1:1 protection may be used.

   Thus, it is possible for the network resources on the segment EFG to
   be shared by the two protection paths.  In this way, shared mesh
   protection can substantially reduce the amount of network resources
   that have to be reserved.

   If there are no failures affecting either of the two working paths,
   the network segment EFG may carry no traffic.  In the event of only
   one failure, the segment EFG carries traffic from the working path
   that experiences the failure.

3.1.  Shared Mesh Protection Planning

   Shared mesh protection will typically be subject to careful network
   planning.  Operator plans the shared mesh protection group (SMPG)
   which includes the protected paths and protecting paths.  Different
   SPMGs do not share protection resources and are protected
   independently.

   In Figure 1, the working LSP W1,W2 and protecting LSPs P1,P2 consist
   of a shared mesh protection group, in which the protecting LSPs P1
   and P2 share the segment FEG although they belong to different
   sessions.  In order to achieve this, the "Resource Sharing"
   Association type that defined in [RFC4873] and
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-ext] can be used here.  When operators plan
   shared mesh protection group, they will assign a group ID and a
   virtual address for the shared mesh protection group.  The protecting
   LSP will be signaled with the "Resource Sharing" type ASSOCIATION
   object, the Association ID is set to the group ID, and the
   Association source is set to the group virtual address.

3.2.  Signaling Protection LSPs

   When the protecting LSPs are signaled, the PROTECTION object, Notify
   Request object and "Recovery" type ASSOCIATION object are included in
   the Path message.  Furthermore, the "Resource Sharing" type
   ASSOCIATION object SHOULD be inserted, the Association ID set to the
   associated protection group ID and the Association source set to the
   protection group virtual address.

   Any node processing a Path message for which the node does not have a
   matching state, and which contains an ASSOCIATION object with a
   "Resource Sharing" type, examines existing LSPs for matching
   Association Type, Association Source, and Association ID values.  If
   any match is found, then [RFC3209] style resource sharing SHOULD be
   provided between the new and old LSPs.

3.3.  Processing

   This section illustrates the realization of the shared mesh
   protection for the topology shown in Figure 1.

3.3.1.  Basic Operation

   If a failure occurs on the W2, the shared mesh protection will
   operate as follows:

   a.  Node H detects the signal failure, switches the traffic to P2,
       and sends Path message to node E with O bit of protection object
       setting to 1.
   b.  Upon receipt of the Path message with the O bit of protection
       object from 0 to 1, node E compares the protection switching
       priority of P2 and P1, then send notify message with the new
       error code/sub-code "notify error/resource occupied by the high
       priority" or "notify error/resource occupied by the low priority"
       to P1's ingress node.

   When the fault of the working LSP disappears, the shared mesh
   protection will operate as follows:

   a.  The ingress node H will switch traffic to the working LSP, and
       refresh the Path message with the O bit of protection object
       setting to 0.
   b.  Upon receiving the Path message with the O bit of protection
       object from 1 to 0, sharing start endpoint(node E) will send
       notify message with new error code/sub-code "notify error/
       resource available" to the other protecting LSP's ingress node.

3.3.2.  Rerouting

   If the ingress of the protecting LSP receives notify message with
   "notify error/resource occupied by the high priority", the node
   should reroute the protecting LSP.  Because that the traffic of
   higher priority LSP may also be lost during the preemption, the node
   may also reroute for a more optimized path according to the local
   policy, when the node receives notify message with "notify error/
   resource occupied by the low priority".  If the protecting LSP
   reroutes, the new LSP will exclude the shared segment which was
   occupied by the other LSP.

3.3.3.  Preemption

   During the sharing resource was occupied by one of the protecting
   LSPs, the other working LSP may also experiences some fault.  In this
   case, these resource MUST be preempted by the high priority LSP.

   In Figure 1, if a failure occurs on the W1 while the W2 is still in
   failure state, the shared mesh protection will operate as follows:

   o  The node A will not switch the traffic, if it has received the
      notification that the resource has been occupied by the high
      priority.
   o  The node A has not received the notification that the resource has
      been occupied by the high priority LSP.  The operation is as
      follows:
      1.  Node A switches the traffic to P1, and sends Path message to
          node E with O bit of protection object setting to 1.
      2.  Once Node E (sharing start endpoint)receives the Path message
          with the O bit of protection object from 0 to 1, it compares
          the protection switching priority of P2 and P1.  The node will
          send notify message with the new error code/sub-code "notify
          error/resource occupied by the high priority" to P2's ingress
          node.
      3.  Upon receipt of the notify message that the resource has been
          occupied by the high priority, node H will switch the traffic
          from P2 to W2, and sends Path message to node E with O bit of
          protection object setting to 0.
