               mLDP in-band signalling Wildcard encoding
         draft-wijnands-mpls-mldp-in-band-wildcard-encoding-00

Abstract

   Documents [RFC6826] and [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-mldp-vrf-in-band-signaling]
   define a solution to splice an IP multicast tree together with a
   multipoint LSP in the global or VRF context.  In these drafts the
   Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol (mLDP) Opaque TLV encodings
   have been documented for Source specific and Bidir IP multicast
   trees.  For each IP multicast tree a multipoint LSP is created.
   There are scenarios where it is beneficial to support shared trees
   and allow aggregation such that fewer multipoint LSPs are created in
   the network.  This document defines wildcard encodings to be used for
   the Source or Group fields of the existing opaque encodings.  With
   the wildcard encoding it is possible to create a single multipoint
   LSP that is used to represent *all* sources for a given multicast
   group or *all* groups for a given source.

   network.  This document defines wildcard encodings that can be used
   in Source or Group fields of the existing Opaque TLV encodings.  With
   the wildcard encoding it is possible to create a single multipoint
   LSP used to represent *all* sources for a given multicast group or
   *all* groups for a given source.

   The behaviour of an mLDP in-band signalled multipoint LSPs containing
   a wildcard entry follows the procedures defined in [RFC6826] and
   [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-mldp-vrf-in-band-signaling].  This draft does not
   talk about already defined procedures but only documents the
   differences.

   There are a few scenarios (not limited to) where wildcard encoding is
   useful, for example;

   o  PIM Shared tree forwarding with threshold infinity.

   o  IGMP/MLD proxying.

   o  Selective Source mapping.

   These scenarios are discussed in this draft below.


3.  PIM shared tree forwarding

   PIM [RFC4601] has the concept of a shared tree, known as (*,G).  This
   means, *all* Sources for a given Group in the ASM range.  The (*,G)
   is built towards the Rendezvous Point (RP) that typically joins *all*
   multicast sources for this group.  The RP will then forward all the
   IP multicast packets for this group down the (*,G) tree towards the
   receivers.  There are several procedures how the RP learns about
   these sources, for example; PIM Registers [RFC4601], MSDP [RFC3618]
   or a Source that is directly connected to the RP.  In some cases, the
   last hop routers does not wish to join the source trees, and expect
   to receive all the traffic for group G from the (*,G) tree; in this
   case, we say that the last hop routers have 'threshold infinity' for
   group G. This is optional behaviour documented in the [RFC4601].
   This is often used in deployments where the RP is between the
   multicast sources and the multicast receivers for group G, i.e., the
   shortest path from any source to any receiver of the group goes
   through the RP.  In this scenario, there is no advantage for a last
   hop router to join a source tree for the group, since joining a
   source tree would not change the path of the multicast data from the
   source.  The only effect of executing the complicated procedures for
   joining a source tree and pruning the source off the shared tree
   would be to an increase of the amount of multicast routing state.

Internet-Draft  mLDP in-band signalling wildcard encoding      July 2013


   This deployment model can be implemented using wildcards.  The egress
   router will splice the (*,G) IP multicast tree to a mLDP Multipoint
   LSP where the Source address is encoded as wildcard entry.  In
   scenarios where it does not make sense to apply "threshold infinity"
   to a given ASM group, a more complex set of procedures are needed, as
   per [I-D.rekhter-pim-sm-over-mldp].


4.  IGMP/MLD proxying

   There are scenarios where the multicast senders and receivers are
   directly connected to a MPLS routing domain and mLDP is available.
   In these cases we can apply "IGMP/MLD proxying" and avoid using PIM
   as a multicast routing protocol to transport multicast packets from
   the senders to the receivers.  The senders and receivers consider the
   MPLS domain to be single hop between each other.  [RFC4605] documents
   procedures where a multicast routing protocol is not nessesary to
   build a 'simple tree'.  Within the MPLS domain mLDP will be used to
   build a 'spanning tree' to avoid looping and duplication of packets,
   but for the point of view of the senders and receivers this is
   hidden.  The procedures as defined [RFC4605] are applicable since the
   senders and receivers are considered to be one hop away from each
   other.

   For mLDP to build a tree, it needs to know the root of the tree.
   Following the procedures as defined in [RFC4605] we depend on manual
   configuration of the mLDP root for the ASM multicast group.  The
   Source will be encoded as a wildcard entry.


5.  Selective Source mapping

   In IPTV deployments, rather often, the content servers are co-located
   in a few sites.  Popular channels are often statically configured and
   always forwarded over the core MPLS network to the egress routers.
   Since these channels are statically defined, they MAY also be
   forwarded over a multipoint LSP with wildcard encoding.  The sort of
   wildcard encoding that needs to be used (Source and/or Group) depends
   on the Source/Group allocation policy of the IPTV provider.  Other
   options are to use MSDP [RFC3618] or BGP AD [RFC6513] for source
   discovery by the ingress LSR.  Based on the received wildcard, the
   ingress LSR can make a selection out of the IP multicast streams it
   has state for.


6.  Wildcard Source

   When the IP multicast component on the ingress LSR has received a

Internet-Draft  mLDP in-band signalling wildcard encoding      July 2013


   wildcard source from mLDP it may have been initiated by one of the
   scenarios described in this draft.  How the wildcard source is to be
   interpretted is a local matter and follows the rules below;

   1.  If PIM is enabled and the group is a non-bidirectional ASM group,
       the wildcard source is treated as having received a (*,G) IGMP/
       MLD report from a downstream node and the procedures as defined
       in [RFC4601] are followed.

   2.  If PIM is enabled and the group mode is PIM-SSM, all multicast
       sources known for the group on the root node must be forwarded
       down the multipoint LSP.

   3.  If PIM is not enabled for this group, the wildcard source is
       treated as having received a (*,G) IGMP/MLD report from a
       downstream node and the procedures as defined in [RFC4605] are
       followed.

   The IP multicast component on the egress LSR determins when a
   Wildcard Source is to be used in a mLDP Opaque TLV encoding.  How the
   IP multicast component determins this is a local matter and
   potentially subjected to explicit user configuration.  It MAY however
   use the following rules (with or without explicit user
   configuration);

   1.  If PIM is enabled, the group is a non-bidirectional ASM group and
       the RP is reachable via a BGP route, a Wildcard Source encoding
       MAY be used to signal group membership (*,G) to the ingress LSR,
       using the BGP next hop as the ingress LSR (root of the LSP).
       Also see Section 8.

   2.  If PIM is not enabled for this group and an IGMP/MLD group
       membership report has been received, the IP multicast component
       may use a Wildcard Source encoding to signal the group membership
       (*,G) to a Proxy device (root of the LSP).  The procedures how to
       determin the Proxy device for a given group are defined in
       [RFC4605].

   The wildcard source encoding MUST NOT appear in the "Bidir TLVs" that
   are defined in [RFC6826] sections 3.3 and 3.4."

   A wildcard group in combination with a wildcard source encoding is
   under investigation.


7.  Wildcard Group

   When the IP multicast component on the root node receives a wildcard

   group encoding, the root node SHOULD apply the wildcard encoding to
   the existing IP multicast routing table and forward all the IP
   multicast stream(s) that match the given Source.  Note, this
   behaviour is independent of the PIM group mode (ie.  ASM or SSM).

   The IP multicast component on the egress LSR determins when a
   Wildcard Group is to be used in a mLDP Opaque TLV encoding.  How the
   IP multicast component determins this is a local matter and subjected
   to explicit user configuration.

   The wildcard group encoding for PIM bidir is under investigation.

   A wildcard source in combination with a wildcard group encoding is
   under investigation.


8.  Root node address discovery

   Documents [RFC6826] and [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-mldp-vrf-in-band-signaling]
   describe procedures to discover the mLDP root node address by using
   the Source of the IP multicast stream.  When a wildcard source
   encoding is used, PIM is enabled and the group is a non-bidirectional
   ASM group, a similar procedure s applied.  The only different with
   the above mentioned procedures is that the Proxy device or RP address
   is used instead of the Source to discover the mLDP root node address.

   In all other cases some sort of manual configuration is applied in
   order to find the root node.  Note, finding the root node is a local
   implementation matter and not limited to the solutions mentioned in
   this draft.


9.  Anycast RP

   With in-band signalling there is likely no RP to Group mappings
   distribution taking place over the MPLS core to the different IP
   multicast sites.  The RP address is likely statically configured on
   each multicast site.  In these cases it makes sense to configure an
   Anycast RP Address to provide redundancy.  See [RFC3446] for more
   details.


10.  Wildcard encoding

   The source and group fields in the Transit IPv4, IPv6, VPNv4 and
   VPNv6 Source TLVs, as documented in [RFC6826] and
   [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-mldp-vrf-in-band-signaling] only allow valid IP
   addresses to be encoded.  This document proposes to use a source/

   group field of *all* zero's to be used as wildcard encoding.

   mentioned in [RFC6826] and
