Abstract

   DS-Lite [RFC6333] directs IANA to reserve 192.0.0.0/29 for the use of
   the B4 element.  This memo generalizes that reservation to include a
   similar purpose on the host-based CLAT IPv4 interfaces in the 464XLAT
   architecture [RFC6877].

INTERNET DRAFT         464XLAT CLAT IPv4 Address        October 10, 2013


1  Introduction

   464XLAT [RFC6877] describes an architecture for providing IPv4
   communication over an IPv6-only network.  One of the methods
   described in [RFC6877] is for the client side translator (CLAT) to be
   embedded in the host, such as a smartphone.  In this scenario, the
   host must have an IPv4 address configured to present to the network
   stack and for applications to bind sockets.

   Any locally unique IPv4 address can be configured on the host-based
   464XLAT CLAT interface.  This memo directs IANA to update its
   registry of 192.0.0.0/29 to include the use for the IPv4 interface in
   host based CLAT by changing the allocation from DS-Lite to "IPv6
   Transition Technology System Subnet".

2.  Choosing 192.0.0.0/29

   To avoid conflicts with any other network that may communicate with
   the CLAT, a unique address must be assigned.

   IANA has defined a well-known range, 192.0.0.0/29, in [RFC6333],
   which is dedicated for DS-lite. 192.0.0.0 is the reserved subnet
   address. As defined in [RFC6333], this subnet is only present between
   the B4 and the AFTR and is never emitted "on the wire".

   This range may be generalized to include 464XLAT with host based CLAT
   and will continue to never be emitted "on the wire".


3  Security Considerations

   No new security considerations beyond what is described [RFC6333] and
   [RFC6877].


4  IANA Considerations

   IANA is directed to generalize the reservation of 192.0.0.0/29 from
   DS-lite to "IPv6 Transition Technology System Subnet".
