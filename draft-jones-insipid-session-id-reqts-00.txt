         Requirements for an End-to-End Session Identification in
                IP-Based Multimedia Communication Networks
                draft-jones-insipid-session-id-reqts-00.txt


Abstract

   This document specifies the requirements for an end-to-end session
   identifier in IP-based multimedia communication networks.  This
   identifier would enable endpoints, intermediate devices, and
   management and monitoring systems to identify a session end-to-end,
   associate multiple endpoints with a given multipoint conference,
   track communication sessions when they are redirected, and associate
   one or more media flows with a given communication session.

1. Introduction

   IP-based multimedia communication systems like SIP [1] and H.323 [2]
   have the concept of a "call identifier" that is globally unique.  The
   identifier is intended to represents an end-to-end communication
   session from the originating device to the terminating device.  Such
   an identifier is useful for troubleshooting, billing, session
   tracking, and so forth.

   Unfortunately, there are a number of factors that contribute to the
   fact that the current call identifiers defined in SIP and H.323 are
   not suitable for end-to-end session identification.  Perhaps most
   significant is the fact that the syntax for the call identifier in
   SIP and H.323 is different between the two protocols.  This important
   fact makes it impossible for call identifiers to be exchanged end-to-
   end when a network utilizes one or more session protocols.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for End-To-End Session ID        March 2012


   Another reason why the current call identifiers are not suitable to
   identify the session end-to-end is that in real-world deployments
   devices like session border controllers often change the values as
   the session signaling passes through.  This is true even when a
   single session protocol is employed and not a byproduct of protocol
   interworking.

   Lastly, identifiers that might have been used to identify a session
   end-to-end fail to meet that need when sessions are manipulated
   through supplementary service interactions.  For example, when a
   session is transferred or if a PBX joins two communication sessions
   together locally, the end-to-end properties of currently-defined
   identifiers are lost.

   This draft specifies the requirements for an end-to-end session
   identifier.  With this draft, the authors would like to encourage
   discussion and progress work in the dispatch working group or working
   group as designated by the IETF, the outcome of which will be a new
   RFC that defines a session ID in conformance with these requirements.

2. Terminology

   SIP defines additional terms used in this document that are specific
   to the SIP domain such as "proxy"; "registrar"; "redirect server";
   "user agent server" or "UAS"; "user agent client" or "UAC"; "back-to-
   back user agent" or "B2BUA"; "dialog"; "transaction"; "server
   transaction".

   In this document, the word "session" refers to a
   "communication session" that may exist between two SIP user agents or
   that might pass through one or more intermediary devices, including
   B2BUAs or SIP Proxies.

   The term "end-to-end" in this document means the communication
   session from the point of origin, passing through any number of
   intermediaries, to the ultimate point of termination. It is
   recognized that legacy devices may not support the "end-to-end"
   session identifier, though an identifier might be created by an
   intermediary when it is absent from the session signaling.

3. Requirements for the End-to-End Session Identifier

   REQ1: It must be possible for an administrator or an external device
   which monitors the SIP-traffic to use the identifier to identify a
   set of dialogs which have a relationship with each other, such that
   they represent the same SIP session, with as high a probability as
   possible.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for End-To-End Session ID        March 2012


   REQ2: It must be possible to identify the end-to-end session when a
   session is transferred or if two different sessions are joined
   together via an intermediary (e.g., a PBX).

   REQ3: It must be possible to identify all sessions participating in a
   multipoint or multi-party conference by observing the end-to-end
   session identifiers of each session.

   REQ4: It must be possible to pass the identifier unchanged through
   SIP B2BUAs or other intermediaries.

   REQ5: The identifier must not reveal any information related to any
   SIP device or domain identity, including IP Address, port, hostname,
   domain name, username, Address-of-Record, MAC address, IP address
   family, transport type, etc.

   REQ6: The identifier must not reveal to the receiver of it that the
   Call-ID, tags, or any other SIP header or body portion have been
   changed by middleboxes, with as high a probability as possible.

   REQ7: It must be possible to identity SIP traffic with an end-to-end
   session identifier from and to end devices that do not support this
   new identifier, such as by allowing an intermediary to inject an
   identifier into the session signaling.

   REQ8: The identifier should be unique in time and space, similar to
   the Call-ID.

   REQ9: The identifier should be constructed in such a way as to make
   it suitable for transmission in SIP, H.323, RSVP [3], and RTCP [4].

4. Session Identifier Use Cases

   The Session Identifier is intended to uniquely identify a
   communication session end-to-end.  This document does not specify how
   the Session Identifier is to be used, but merely defines the
   identifier in such a way as to enable it to be used for situations
   encountered in real-world deployments of IP-based multimedia
   communication systems, including:

     * End-to-end identification of a communication session

     * Association of session signaling and media flows, made possible
       by including the session identifier in media-related messages
       (e.g., RSVP or RTCP)

     * Identification of devices taking part in the same multipoint
       conference

     * Tracking sessions transferred from one endpoint to another

     * Facilitate the recording of SIP sessions and correlating those
       sessions

     * Logging for the purposes of accounting, billing, debugging,
       communication tracking (such as for security purposes in case of
       theft of service), etc.

5. Related Work in other Standards Organizations

5.1. Coordination with the ITU-T

   IP multimedia networks are often comprised of a mix of session
   protocols like SIP and H.323. A benefit of the Session Identifier is
   that it uniquely identifies a communication session end-to-end across
   session protocol boundaries. Therefore, the need for coordinated
   standardization activities across Standards Development Organizations
   (SDOs) is imperative.

   To facilitate this, a parallel effort is underway in the ITU-T to
   introduce the Session Identifier for the H.323 protocol. The ITU-T
   SG16 has approved contribution C.552 [5] as a work item with the
   intent that it be a coordinated and synchronized effort between the
   ITU-T and the IETF.

5.2. Requirements within 3GPP

   3GPP identified in their Release 9 the need for a Session Identifier
   for O&M purposes to correlate flows in an end-to-end communication
   session.  TS24.229 (IP multimedia call control protocol based on
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session Description Protocol
   (SDP)) [6] points to the fact that the Session Identifier can be used
   to correlate SIP messages belonging to the same session.  In the case
   where signaling passes through SIP entities like B2BUAs, the end-to-
   end session identifier indicates that these dialogs belong to the
   same end-to-end SIP communication session.

6. Security Considerations

   An end-to-end identifier, if not properly constructed, could provide
   information that would allow one to identify the individual, device,
   or domain initiating or terminating a communication session.  In
   adherence with REQ5, the solution produced in accordance with these
   requirements MUST NOT provide any information that allow one to
   identify a person, device, or domain.  This means that information
   elements such as the MAC address or IP address MUST NOT be used when
   constructing the end-to-end session identifier.
