        extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended Report (XR).

        <t>The Performance Metrics Framework <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>
        provides guidance on the definition and specification of performance
        metrics. The RTP Monitoring Architectures <xref
        target="RFC6792"></xref> provides guideline for reporting block format
        using RTCP XR. Metrics described in this draft are in accordance with
        the guidelines in <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>and <xref
        target="RFC6792"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>Real-time applications employ a de-de-jitter buffer <xref
        target="RFC5481"></xref> to absorb jitter introduced on the path from
        source to destination. These metrics are used to report how the
        de-jitter buffer at the receiving end of RTP stream behaves as a
        result of jitter in the network; and they are applicable to a range of
        RTP applications.</t>

        <t>These metrics are corresponding to terminal related factors that
        affect real-time application quality and are useful to provide better
        end-user quality of experience (QoE) when these terminal-related
        factors are used as inputs to calculate QoE metrics [QMB].</t>

    <section title="De-Jitter Buffer Operation">
      <t>A de-jitter buffer is required to absorb delay variation in network
      delivery of media packets. A de-jitter buffer works by holding media
      data for a period of time after it is received and before it is played
      out. Packets that arrive early are held in the de-jitter buffer longer.
      If packets arrive too early they may be discarded if there is no
      available de-jitter buffer space. If packets are delayed excessively by
      the network they may be discarded if they miss their playout time.</t>

      <t>The de-jitter buffer can be considered as a time window with early
      edge aligned with the delay corresponding to the earliest arriving
      packet and late edge representing the maximum permissible delay before a
      late arriving packet would be discarded. The delay applied to packets
      that arrive on time or at their expected arrival time is known as the
      Nominal Delay and this is equivalent to the time difference/ buffer size
      difference between the on-time packets insertion point and the point at
      which packets are read out.</t>

      <t>The reference for the expected arrival time may, for example, be the
      first packet in the session or the running average delay. If all packets
      arrived at their expected arrival time, then every packet would be held
      in the de-jitter buffer exactly the Nominal Delay.</t>

      <t>The de-jitter buffer maximum delay is the delay that is applied to an
      earliest arriving packet that is not discarded and corresponds to the
      early edge of the de-jitter buffer time window.</t>

      <section title="Idealized De-Jitter Buffer">
        <t>In practice de-jitter buffer implementations vary considerably
        however they should behave in a manner conceptually consistent with an
        idealized de-jitter buffer described as follows:<list>
            <t>(i). Receive the first packet and delay playout by D ms. Keep
            the RTP timestamp and receive time as a reference.<vspace
            blankLines="1" />RTP Timestamp(TS)[1]<vspace
            blankLines="1" />receive time[1]<vspace blankLines="1" />Assume
            that both are normalized in ticks (there are 10 000 ticks in a
            millisecond).</t>

            <t>(ii). Receive the next packet</t>

            <t>(iii). Calculate r = RTP TS[n] - RTP TS[1] and t = receive
            time[n] - receive time[1]. If r == t then the packet arrived on
            time. If r &lt; t then the packet arrived late and if r &gt; t
            then the packet arrived early.</t>

            <t>(iv). Delay playout of packet by D + (r-t)</t>

            <t>(v). Go back to (ii)</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Note that this idealized implementation assumes that the sender's
        RTP clock is synchronized to the clock in the receiver which is used
        to timestamp packet arrivals. If there is no such inherent
        synchronization, the system may need to use an adaptive de-jitter
        buffer or other techniques to ensure reliable reception.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Fixed De-Jitter Buffer">
        <t>A fixed de-jitter buffer lacks provision to track network condition
        and has a fixed size and packets leaving the de-jitter buffer have a
        constant delay. For fixed de-jitter buffer implementation, the nominal
        delay is set to a constant value corresponding to the packets that
        arrive at their expected arrival time while the maximum delay is set
        to a constant value corresponding to the fixed size of the de-jitter
        buffer.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Adaptive De-Jitter Buffer">
        <t>An adaptive de-jitter buffer can adapt to the change in the
        networkâ€™s delay and has variable size or variable delay. It allows the
        nominal delay to be set to a low value initially, to minimize user
        perceived delay, however can automatically extend the late edge (and
        possibly also retract the early edge) of buffer window if a
        significant proportion of packets are arriving late (and hence being
        discarded).</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="De-Jitter Buffer Metrics Block">
      <t>This block describes the configuration and operating parameters of
      the de-jitter buffer in the receiver of the RTP end system or RTP mixer
      which sends the report. Instances of this metrics block refer by SSRC to
      the separate auxiliary Measurement Information Block <xref
      target="RFC6776"></xref> which describes the measurement interval in
      use. This metrics block relies on the measurement interval in the
      Measurement Information Block indicating the span of the report and MUST
      be sent in the same compound RTCP packet as the Measurement Information
      Block. If the measurement interval is not received in the same compound
      RTCP packet as this metrics block, this metrics block MUST be
      discarded.</t>

            <t>In many standards track documents several words are used to
            signify the requirements in the specification. These words are
            often capitalized. This document defines these words as they
            should be interpreted in IETF documents. Authors who follow these
            guidelines should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of
            their document: <list>
                <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
                "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
                "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
                in RFC 2119.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for
            the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR
            packets can be signaled by an application if it employs the
            Session Description Protocol (SDP). XR packets are composed of
            report blocks, and seven block types are defined here. The purpose
            of the extended reporting format is to convey information that
            supplements the six statistics that are contained in the report
            blocks used by RTCP's Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR)
            packets. Some applications, such as multicast inference of network
            characteristics (MINC) or voice over IP (VoIP) monitoring, require
            other and more detailed statistics. In addition to the block types
            defined here, additional block types may be defined in the future
            by adhering to the framework that this document provides.</t>
