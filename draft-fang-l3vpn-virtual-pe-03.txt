Abstract 

   This document describes the architecture solutions for BGP/MPLS IP
   Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) with virtual Provider Edge (vPE)
   routers. It provides a functional description of the vPE control
   plane, the data plane, and the provisioning management process. The
   vPE solutions supports both Software Defined Networking (SDN)
   approach by allowing physical decoupling of the control and the
   forwarding plane of a vPE, as well as a distributed routing approach.
   These solutions allow vPE to be co-resident with the application
   virtual machines (VMs) on a single end device, such as a server, as
   well as on a Top-of-Rack switch (ToR), or in any network or compute
   device. The ability to provide end-to-end native BGP IP VPN
   connections between a Data Center (DC) (and/or other types of service
   network) applications and the Enterprise IP VPN sites is highly
   desirable to both Service Providers and Enterprises.

INTERNET DRAFT           BGP IP VPN Virtual PE             July 15, 2013


1  Introduction

   Network virtualization enables multiple isolated individual networks
   over a shared common network infrastructure. BGP/MPLS IP Virtual
   Private Networks (IP VPNs) [RFC4364] have been widely deployed to
   provide network based IP VPNs solutions. [RFC4364] provides routing
   isolation among different customer VPNs and allow address overlapping
   among these VPNs through the implementation of per VPN Virtual
   Routing and Forwarding instances (VRFs) at a Service Provider Edge
   (PE) routers, while forwarding customer traffic over a common IP/MPLS
   network infrastructure.

   With the advent of compute capabilities and the proliferation of
   virtualization in Data Center servers, a multi-tenant Data Center
   becomes a reality. As applications and appliances are increasingly
   being virtualized, support for virtual edge devices, such as virtual
   IP VPN PE routers, becomes feasible and a natural part of the overall
   virtualization solutions. There is a strong desire from Service
   Providers to extend their existing BGP IP VPN deployments into Data
   Centers to provide Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) services, as well as
   to support virtual network functions, including IP VPN PE functions
   outside of Data Centers. Scale and efficiency are crucial factors in
   the cloud computing environment supporting various applications and
   services, and in traditional service provider space.

   The virtual Provider Edge (vPE) solution described in this document
   allows for the extension of the PE functionality of BGP/MPLS IP VPN
   to end devices, such as servers where the applications reside, or to
   the first hop routing/switching device, such as a Top of the Rack
   switch (ToR) in a Data Center. 

   The vPE solutions support both Software Defined Network (SDN)
   approach by allowing physical decoupling of the control and the
   forwarding plane of a vPE, and distributed routing approaches in the
   same fashion as IP VPN is achieved with the physical PEs.

1.2 Motivation and requirements

   The recent rapid adoption of Cloud Services by Enterprises and the
   phenomenal growth of mobile IP applications accelerate the need to
   extend the BGP IP VPN capability into cloud service end devices. For
   examples, Enterprise customers' want to extend the existing IP VPN
   services in the WAN into the new cloud services supported by various
   Data Center (DC) technologies; Large Enterprises have existing L3VPN
   deployments and are extending them into their Data Centers; Mobile
   providers adopting IP VPN into their 3GPP mobile infrastructure are
   looking to extend the IP VPNs to their end devices of the call
   processing center. In addition, vPE is one of the earlier work as
   part of Network Function Virtualization (NfV) effort, where IP VPN PE
   function is one of the network functions subject to virtualization.
   In general, the vPE solutions can be used in cloud service
   development or any other environment with or without the inter-

   connection to existing Enterprise BGP IP VPNs. 

   Key requirements for vPE solutions:

   1) MUST support end device multi-tenancy, per tenant routing
   isolation and traffic separation.

   2) MUST support large scale IP VPNs in the Data Center, upto tens of
   thousands of end devices and millions of VMs in the single Data
   Center.

   3) MUST support end-to-end IP VPN connectivity, e.g. IP VPN can start
   from a Data Center end device, connect to a corresponding IP VPN in
   the WAN, and terminate in another Data Center end device.

   4) MUST allow physical decoupling of IP VPN PE control plane and
   forwarding for network virtualization and abstraction.

   5) MUST provide support of the control plane through a SDN controller
   (centralized or distributed), as well as through the traditional
   distributed MP-BGP approach.

   6) MUST support VM mobility

   7) MUST support orchestration/provisioning as a key deployment model

   8) SHOULD be capable to support service chaining as part of the
   solution [I-D.rfernando-l3vpn-service-chaining], [I-D.bitar-i2rs-
   service-chaining].

   The architecture and protocols defined in BGP/MPLS IP VPN [RFC4364]
   provide the foundation for virtual PE extension. Certain protocol
   extensions may be needed to support the virtual PE solutions.

2. Virtual PE Architecture

2.1 Virtual PE definitions

   As defined in [RFC4364], an IP VPN is created by applying policies to
   form a subset of sites among all sites connected to the backbone
   network. It is a  collection of "sites". A site can be considered as
   a set of IP systems maintaining IP inter-connectivity without direct
   connecting through the backbone. The typical use of L3VPM has been to
   inter-connect different sites of an Enterprise networks through a
   Service Provider's BGP IP VPNs in the WAN. 

   A virtual PE (vPE) is a BGP IP VPN PE software instance which may
   reside in any network or computing devices. The control and

INTERNET DRAFT           BGP IP VPN Virtual PE             July 15, 2013


   forwarding components of the vPE can be decoupled, they may reside in
   the same physical device, or most often in different physical
   devices.

   A virtualized Provider Edge Forwarder (vPE-F) is the forwarding
   element of a vPE. vPE-F can reside in an end device, such as a server
   in a Data Center where multiple application Virtual Machines (VMs)
   are supported, or a Top-of-Rack switch (ToR) which is the first hop
   switch from the Data Center edge. When a vPE-F is residing in a
   server, its connection to a co-resident VM is as the same as the PE-
   CE relationship in the regular BGP IP VPNs, but without routing
   protocols or static routing between the virtual PE and CE because the
   connection is internal to the device. 

   The vPE Control plane (vPE-C) is the control element of a vPE. When
   using the approach where control plane is decoupled from the physical
   topology, the vPE-F may be in a server and co-resident with
   application VMs, while one vPE-C can be in a separate device, such as
   an SDN Controller where control plane elements and orchestration
   functions are located. Alternatively, the vPE-C  can reside in the
   same physical device as the vPE-F. In this case, it is similar to the
   traditional implementation of VPN PEs where, distributed MP-BGP is
   used for IP VPN information exchange, though the vPE is not a
   dedicated physical entity as it is in a physical PE implementation.  


2.2 vPE Architecture and Design options

2.2.1 vPE-F host location 

   Option 1a. vPE-F is on an end device as co-resident with application
   VMs. For example, the vPE-F is on a server in a Data Center. 

   Option 1b. vPE-F forwarder is on a ToR or other first hop devices in
   a Data Center, not as co-resident with the application VMs.

   Option 1c. vPE-F is located on any network or compute devices in any
   type of networks. 

2.2.2 vPE control plane topology

   Option 2a. vPE control plane is physically decoupled from the vPE-F.
   The control plane may be located in a controller in a separate device
   (a stand alone device or can be in the gateway as well) from the vPE
   forwarding plane. 

   Option 2b. vPE control plane is supported through dynamic routing
   protocols and located in the same physical device as the vPE-F.

2.2.3 Data Center orchestration models

   Option 3a. Push model: It is a top down approach, push IP VPN
   provisioning state from a network management system or other
   centrally controlled provisioning system to the IP VPN network
   elements.

   Option 3b. Pull model: It is a bottom-up approach, pull state
   information from network elements to network management/AAA based
   upon data plane or control plane activity. 

2.3 vPE Architecture reference models

2.3.1 vPE-F in an end-device and vPE-C in the controller

   Figure 1 illustrates the reference model for a vPE solution with the
   vPE-F in the end device co-resident with applications VMs, while the
   vPE-C is physically decoupled and residing on a controller. 

   The Data Center is connected to the IP/MPLS core via the
   Gatways/ASBRs. The IP VPN , e.g. VPN RED, has a single termination
   point within the Data Center at one of the VPE-F, and is inter-
   connected in the WAN to other member sites which belong to the same
   client, and the remote ends of VPN RED can be a PE which has VPN RED
   attached to it, or another vPE in a different Data Center. 

   Note that the Data Center fabric/intermediate underlay devices in the
   Data Center do not participate IP VPNs, their function is the same as
   P routers in the IP/MPLS back bone and they do not maintain the IP
   VPN states, not IP VPN aware.

2.3.4 vPE-F on the ToR and vPE-C on the controller

   In this option, the L3VPN termination is at the ToR, but the control
   plane decoupled from the data plane and resided in a controller,
   which can be on a stand alone device, or can be placed at the
   Gateway/ASBR.

2.3.5 Server view of vPE

   An end device shown in Figure 4 is a virtualized server that hosts
   multiple VMs. The virtual PE is co-resident in the server. The vPE
   supports multiple VRFs, VRF Red, VRF Grn, VRF Yel, VRF Blu, etc. Each
   application VM is associated to a particular VRF as a member of the
   particular VPN. For example, VM1 is associated to VRF Red, VM2 and
   VM47 are associated to VRF Grn, etc. Routing isolation applies
   between VPNs for multi-tenancy support. For example, VM1 and VM2
   cannot communicate directly in a simple intranet L3VPN topology as
   shown in the configuration. 

   The vPE connectivity relationship between vPE and the application VM
   is similar to the PE-to-CE relationship in a regular BGP IP VPNs.
   However, as the vPE and CE functions are co-resident in the same
   server, the connection between them is an internal implementation of
   the server.

   An application VM may send packets to a vPE forwarder that need to be
   bridged, either locally to another VM, or to a remote destination. In
   this case, the vPE contains a virtual bridge instance to which the
   application VMs (CEs) are attached.

3. Control Plane

3.1 vPE Control Plane (vPE-C)

   The vPE control plane functionality MAY use a SDN controller or be
   distributed using MP-BGP.

3.1.1 SDN approach

   This approach is appropriate when the vPE control and data planes are
   physically decoupled. The control plane directing the data flow may
   reside elsewhere, such a SDN controller. This approach requires a
   standard interface to the routing system. The Interface to Routing
   System (I2RS) is work in progress in IETF as described in [I-D.atlas-
   i2rs-architecture], [I-D.rfernando-irs-fw-req]. 

   Although MP-BGP is often the de facto preferred choice between vPE
   and gateway-PE/ASBR, the use of extensible signaling messaging
   protocols MAY often be more practical in a Data Center environment.
   One such proposal that uses this approach is detailed in [I-D.ietf-
   l3vpn-end-system].

INTERNET DRAFT           BGP IP VPN Virtual PE             July 15, 2013


3.1.2 Distributed control plane

   In the distributed control plane approach, the vPE participates in
   the overlay L3VPN control protocol: MP-BGP [RFC4364]. 

   When the vPE function is on a ToR, it participates the underlay
   routing through IGP protocols: ISIS or OSPF.

   When the vPE function is on a server, it functions as a host attached
   to a server.

3.3 Use of router reflector

   Modern Data Centers can be very large in scale. For example, the
   number of VPNs routes in a very large Data Centers can surpass the
   scale of those in a Service Provider backbone VPN network. There may
   be tens of thousands of end devices in a single Data Center. 

   Use of Router Reflector (RR) is necessary in large-scale L3VPN
   networks to avoid a full iBGP mesh among all vPEs and PEs. The L3 VPN
   routes can be partitioned to a set of RRs, the partitioning
   techniques are detailed in [RFC4364]. 

   When the RR is residing in a physical device, e.g., a server, which
   is partitioned to support multi-functions and applications VMs, the
   RR becomes a  virtualized RR (vRR). Since RR's performs control plane
   only, a physical or virtualized server with large scale of computing
   power and memory can be a good candidate as host of vRRs. The vRR can
   also reside be in Gateway PE/ASBR, or in an end device. 

3.4 Use of Constrained Route Distribution [RFC4684]

   The Constrained Route Distribution [RFC4684] is a powerful tool for
   selective L3VPN route distribution. Using this functionality, only
   the BGP receivers (e.g, PE/vPE/RR/vRR/ASBRs, etc.) with the
   particular L3VPNs attached will receive the route update for the
   corresponding VPNs. It is critical to use constrained route
   distribution to support large-scale L3VPN developments. 

4. Forwarding Plane

4.1 Virtual Interface

   A Virtual Interface (VI) is an interface within an end device that is
   used for connection of the vPE to the application VMs in the same end
   device. Such application VMs are treated as CEs in the regular
   L3VPN's view.

4.2 Virtual Provider Edge Forwarder (vPE-F)

   The Virtual Provider Edge Forwarder (vPE-F) is the forwarding
   component of a vPE where the tenant identifiers (for example MPLS VPN
   labels) are pushed/popped.

   The vPE-F location options include:

   1) Within the end device where the virtual interface and application
   VMs are located. 

   2) In an external device such as a Top of the Rack switch (ToR) in a
   Data Center into which the end device connects.

   Multiple factors should be considered for the location of the vPE-F,
   including device capabilities, overall solution economics,
   QoS/firewall/NAT placement, optimal forwarding, latency and
   performance, operational impact, etc. There are design tradeoffs, it
   is worth the effort to study the traffic pattern and forwarding
   looking trend in your own unique Data Center as part of the exercise.

4.3 Encapsulation

   There are two existing standardized encapsulation/forwarding options
   tipically used for BGP/MPLS L3VPN. 

       1. MPLS label stack encoding with Label Distribution Protocol
   [LDP], [RFC3032][RFC5036].

       2. Encapsulating MPLS packets in IP or Generic Routing
   Encapsulation (GRE), [RFC4023], [RFC4797]. 

       3. Other types of encapsulation are possible. For example, VXLAN
   [I-D.mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan], NVGRE [I-D.sridharan-
   virtualization-nvgre], and other modified version of these or other
   existing protocols.

   The most common BGP/MPLS L3VPNs deployments in Service Provider
   networks use MPLS forwarding. This requires that an MPLS transport,
   e.g., Label Switched Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036] to be deployed in the
   network. It is proven to scale, and it comes with various security
   mechanisms to protect the network against attacks. 

   However, the Data Center environment is different than the Service
   Provider VPN networks or large Enterprise backbones. MPLS deployments
   may or may not be feasible or desirable. Two major challenges for
   MPLS deployments exist in this new environment: 1) the capabilities
   of the end devices and the transport/forwarding devices; 2) the

   workforce skill set. 

   Encapsulating MPLS in IP or GRE tunnel [RFC4023] may often be more
   practical in most Data Center, and computing environments. Note that
   when IP encapsulations are used, the associated security
   considerations must be analyzed carefully.

   In addition, there are new encapsulation proposals for Data Centers
   currently as work in progress within IETF, including several UDP
   based encapsulations proposals and some TCP based proposal. These
   overlay encapsulations can be suitable alternatives for a vPE,
   considering the availability and leverage of support in virtual and
   physical devices.

4.4 Optimal forwarding

   Many large cloud service operators have reported that the traffic
   patterns in their Data Centers were dominated by East-West across
   subnet traffic (between the end device hosting different applications
   in different subnets) rather than North-South traffic (going in/out
   of the Data Center and to/from the WAN) or switched traffic within
   subnets. This is the primary reason that many new large scale design
   has moved away from traditional Layer-2 design to Layer-3, especially
   for the overlay networks. 

   When forwarding the traffic within the same VPN, the vPE SHOULD be
   able to provide direct communication among the VMs/application
   senders/receivers without the need of going through gateway devices.
   If it is on the same end device, the traffic should not need to leave
   the same device. If it is on different end device, optimal routing
   SHOULD be applied. 

   When multiple VPNs need to be accessed to the end device virtual
   interfaces CAN directly access multiple VPNs via using extranet VPN
   techniques without the need of Gateway facilitation. This is done
   through the use of BGP L3VPN policy control mechanisms to support
   this function. In addition, ECMP is a built in layer-3 mechanism and
   it is used for load sharing. 

   Optimal use of available bandwidth can be achieved by virtue of using
   ECMP in the underlay, as long as the encapsulation includes certain
   entropy in the header (e.g. VXLAN).

4.5 Routing and Bridging Services

   A VPN forwarder (vPE-F) may support both IP forwarding as well as
   Layer-2 bridging for traffic from attached end hosts. This traffic
   may be between end hosts attached to the same VPN forwarder or to
 


Fang et al.            Expires <January 15, 2014>              [Page 16]

INTERNET DRAFT           BGP IP VPN Virtual PE             July 15, 2013


   different VPN forwarders.  

   In both cases, forwarding at a VPN forwarder takes place based on the
   IP or MAC route entries provisioned by the VPE controller.  

   When the vPE is providing a Layer-3 service to attached CEs, the VPN
   forwarder will have a VPN VRF instance with IP routes installed for
   both locally attached end-hosts and ones reachable via other VPN
   forwarders. The vPE may perform IP routing for all IP packets in this
   mode.

   When the vPE provides a Layer-2 service to attached end-hosts, the
   VPN forwarder will have an E-VPN instance with appropriate MAC
   entries.

   The vPE may support an Integrated Routing and Bridging service, in
   which case the relevant VPN forwarders will have both MAC and IP
   table entries installed, and will appropriately route or switch
   incoming packets.

   The vPE controller does the necessary provisioning to support various
   services, as defined by an user.

5. Addressing

5.1 IPv4 and IPv6 support

   IPv4 and IPv6 MUST be supported in the vPE solution.

   This may present a challenge for older devices, but may not be an
   issue for newer forwarding devices and servers. A server is replaced
   much more frequently than a network router/switch and newer equipment
   should be capable of IPv6 support. 

5.2 Address space separation

   The addresses used for the IP VPN overlay in a Data Center, SHOULD be
   taken from separate address blocks than the ones used for the
   underlay infrastructure of the Data Center. This practice is to
   protect the Data Center infrastructure from being attacked if the
   attacker gains access to the tenant VPNs.

   Similarity, the addresses used for the Data Center, e.g., a Data
   Center, SHOULD be separated from the WAN backbone addresses space. 

6.0 Inter-connection considerations 

   The inter-connection considerations in this section are focused on

INTERNET DRAFT           BGP IP VPN Virtual PE             July 15, 2013


   intra-DC inter-connections.

   There are deployment scenarios where IP VPN may not be supported in
   every segment of the networks to provide end-to-end IP VPN
   connectivity. An IP VPN vPE may be reachable only via an intermediate
   inter-connecting network; interconnection may be needed in these
   cases.

   When multiple technologies are employed in the overall solution, a
   clear demarcation should be preserved at the inter-connecting points.
   The problems encountered in one domain should not impact other
   domains.

   From an IP VPN point of view: An IP VPN vPE that implements [RFC4364]
   is a component of the IP VPN network only. An IP VPN VRF on a
   physical PE or vPE contains IP routes only, including routes learnt
   over the locally attached network. 

   As described earlier in this document, the IP VPN vPE should ideally
   be located as close to the "customer" edge devices. For cases where
   this is not possible, simple existing "IP VPN CE connectivity"
   mechanisms should be used, such as static, or direct VM attachments
   such as described in the vCE [I-D.fang-l3vpn-virtual-ce] option
   below.

   Consider the following scenarios when BGP MPLS VPN technology is
   considered as whole or partial deployment: 

   Scenario 1: All VPN sites (CEs/VMs) support IP connectivity. The most
   suited BGP solution is to use IP VPNs [RFC4364] for all sites with PE
   and/or vPE solutions. This is a straightforward case.

   Scenario 2: Legacy layer-2 connectivity must be supported in certain
   sites/CEs/VMs, and the rest of the sites/CEs/VMs need only 3
   connectivity.

   One can consider using a combined vPE and vCE [I-D.fang-l3vpn-
   virtual-ce] solution to solved the problem. Use of IP VPN for all
   sites with IP connectivity, and a physical or virtual CE (vCE, may
   reside on the end device) to aggregate the Layer-2 sites which for
   example, are in a single container in a Data Center. The CE/vCE can
   be considered as inter-connecting points, where the Layer-2 network
   is terminated and the corresponding routes for connectivity of the L2
   network are inserted into L3VPN VRFs. The Layer-2 aspect is
   transparent to the L3VPN in this case.

   Reducing operation complicity and maintaining the robustness of the
   solution are the primary reasons for the recommendations.

7. Management, Control, and Orchestration 

7.1 Assumptions

   The discussion in this section is based on the following set of
   assumptions:

   - The WAN and the inter-connecting Data Center, MAY be under control
   of separate administrative domains 

   - WAN Gateways/ASBRs/PEs are provisioned by existing WAN provisioning
   systems

   - If a single Gateway/ASBR/PE connecting to the WAN on one side, and
   connecting to the Data Center network on the other side, then this
   Gateway/ASBR/PE is the demarcation point between the two networks.

   - vPEs and VMs are provisioned by Data Center Orchestration systems.

   - Managing IP VPNs in the WAN is not within the scope of this
   document except the inter-connection points. 

7.2 Management/Orchestration system interfaces

   The Management/Orchestration system CAN be used to communicate with
   both the Data Center Gateway/ASBR, and the end devices. 

   The Management/Orchestration system MUST support standard,
   programmatic interface for full-duplex, streaming state transfer in
   and out of the routing system at the Gateway.  

   The programmatic interface is currently under definition in IETF
   Interface to Routing Systems (I2RS)) initiative. [I-D.atlas-i2rs-
   architecture], and [I-D.rfernando-irs-fw-req]. 

   Standard data modeling languages will be defined/identified in I2RS.
   YANG - A Data Modeling Language for the Network Configuration
   Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6020] is a promising candidate currently under
   investigation.

   To support remote access between applications running on an end
   device (e.g., a server) and routers in the network (e.g. the DC
   Gateway), a standard mechanism is expected to be identified and
   defined in I2RS to provide the transfer syntax,  as defined by a
   protocol, for communication between the application and the
   network/routing systems. The protocol(s) SHOULD be lightweight and
   familiar by the computing communities. Candidate examples include
   ReSTful web services, JSON [RFC4627], NETCONF [RFC6241], XMPP

   [RFC6120], and XML. [I-D.atlas-i2rs-architecture].  

7.3 Service VM Management

   Service VM Management SHOULD be hypervisor agnostic, e.g. On demand
   service VMs turning-up SHOULD be supported. 

7.4 Orchestration and IP VPN inter-provisioning

   The orchestration system

   1) MUST support IP VPN service activation in virtualized Data Center.

   2) MUST support automated cross-provisioning accounting correlation
   between the WAN IP VPN and Data Center for the same tenant.

   3) MUST support automated cross provisioning state correlation
   between WAN IP VPN and Data Center for the same tenant

   There are two primary approaches for IP VPN provisioning - push and
   pull, both CAN be used for provisioning/orchestration. 

7.4.1 vPE Push model

   Push model: push IP VPN provisioning from management/orchestration
   systems to the IP VPN network elements.

   This approach supports service activation and it is commonly used in
   existing IP VPN Enterprise deployments. When extending existing WAN
   IP VPN solutions into the a Data Center, it MUST support off-line
   accounting correlation between the WAN IP VPN and the cloud/DC IP VPN
   for the tenant. The systems SHOULD be able to bind interface
   accounting to particular tenant. It MAY requires offline state
   correlation as well, for example, binding of interface state to
   tenant.

   Provisioning the vPE solution:

   1) Provisioning process 

      a. The WAN provisioning system periodically provides to the DC
         orchestration system the VPN tenant and RT context.
      b. DC orchestration system configures vPE on a per request basis

   2) Auto state correlation

   3) Inter-connection options:

 


Fang et al.            Expires <January 15, 2014>              [Page 20]

INTERNET DRAFT           BGP IP VPN Virtual PE             July 15, 2013


      Inter-AS options defined in [RFC4364] may or may not be sufficient
      for a given inter-connection scenario. BGP IP VPN inter-connection
      with the Data Center is discussed in [I-D.fang-l3vpn-data-center-
      interconnect].

      This model requires offline accounting correlation

      1) Cloud/DC orchestration configures vPE

      2) Orchestration initiates WAN IP VPN provisioning; passes
      connection IDs (e.g., of VLAN/VXLAN) and tenant context to WAN IP
      VPN provisioning systems.

      3) WAN IP VPN provisioning system provisions PE VRF and policies
      as in typical Enterprise IP VPN provisioning processes.

      4) Cloud/DC Orchestration system or WAN IP VPN provisioning system
      MUST have the knowledge of the connection topology between the DC
      and WAN, including the particular interfaces on core router and
      connecting interfaces on the DC PE and/or vPE. 

      In short, this approach requires off-line accounting correlation
      and state correlation, and requires per WAN Service Provider
      integration.

      Dynamic BGP sessions between PE/vPE and vCE MAY be used to
      automate the PE provisioning in the PE-vCE model, that will remove
      the needs for PE configuration. Caution: This is only under the
      assumption that the DC provisioning system is trusted and can
      support dynamic establishment of PE-vCE BGP neighbor
      relationships, for example, the WAN network and the cloud/DC
      belong to the same Service Provider.

7.4.2 vPE Pull model

      Pull model: pull from network elements to network management/AAA
      based upon data plane or control plane activity. It supports
      service activation. This approach is often used in broadband
      deployments. Dynamic accounting correlation and dynamic state
      correlation are supported. For example, session based accounting
      is implicitly includes tenant context state correlation, as well
      as session-based state that implicitly includes tenant context.
      Note that the pull model is less common for vPE deployment
      solutions.

      Provisioning process:

      1) Cloud/DC orchestration configures vPE
 


Fang et al.            Expires <January 15, 2014>              [Page 21]

INTERNET DRAFT           BGP IP VPN Virtual PE             July 15, 2013


      2) Orchestration primes WAN IP VPN provisioning/AAA for new
      service, passes connection IDs (e.g., VLAN/VXLAN) and tenant
      context.

      3) Cloud/DC ASBR detects new VLAN and sends Radius Access-Request
      (or Diameter Base Protocol request message [RFC6733]).

      4) Radius Access-Accept (or Diameter Answer) with VRF and other
      policies

      Auto accounting correlation and auto state correlation is
      supported.


7.  Security Considerations

      vPE solution presented a virtualized IP VPN PE model. There are
      potential implications to IP VPN control plane, forwarding plane,
      and management plane. Security considerations are currently under
      study, will be included in the future revisions. 

8.  IANA Considerations

      None.
