    Negotiation of Extra Round Trip for Kerberos V5 Generic Security
                           Services Mechanism
                 draft-williams-kitten-krb5-extra-rt-01

Abstract

   This Internet-Draft proposes an extension to the Kerberos V5 security
   mechanism for the Generic Security Services Application Programming
   Interface (GSS-API) for using an extra pair of security context
   tokens in order to recover from certain errors.  Other benefits
   include: user2user authentication, authenticated errors (in some
   cases), and more.

Internet-Draft              Kerberos Extra AP              February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Kerberos V5 [RFC4120] AP protocol, and therefore the Kerberos V5
   GSS mechanism [RFC4121] security context token exchange, is a one-
   round-trip protocol.  Occasionally there are errors that the protocol
   could recover from by using an additional round trip, but until now
   there was no way to execute such an additional round trip.  For many
   application protocols the failure of the Kerberos AP protocol is
   fatal, requiring closing TCP connections and starting over; often
   there is no automatic recovery.  This document proposes a negotiation
   of an additional round trip for automatic recovery from certain
   errors.  This is done in a backwards-compatible way, thus retaining
   the existing mechanism OID for the Kerberos V5 GSS mechanism.
   Additionally we add support for user2user authentication and
   authenticated errors, and provide a way to avoid the need for replay
   caching.

Internet-Draft              Kerberos Extra AP              February 2013


2.  Negotiation

   We introduce the following new protocol elements.  An ASN.1 module is
   given in Section 3, and references to its contents are made below.

   o  a new ap-options flag for use in the clear-text part of AP-REQs to
      indicate the desire for an extra round trip if need be;

   o  a new Authorization-Data element for use in Authenticators for
      quoting back a challenge nonce from the acceptor;

   o  a new PDU: KRB-ERROR2, with additional fields and support for
      authenticated errors.

   To use this feature, initiators and acceptors MUST act as follows:

   o  To request this feature, initiators SHALL add the new ap-options
      flag to their AP-REQs.

   o  Acceptors that wish to request an additional round trip SHOULD do
      so when initiators indicate support for it, and do so by returning
      a KRB-ERROR2.  The encrypted part of the KRB-ERROR2 SHALL be
      encrypted in one of the following keys: the sub-session key from
      the AP-REQ's Authenticator if it could be decrypted, the session
      key from the Ticket, if it could be decrypted, or the null enc-
      type and null key.  The KRB-ERROR2 in this case SHALL have a the
      continue-needed e-flag set.  The acceptor SHALL also return
      GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED to the application.

   o  Initiators that request this feature and receive a KRB-ERROR2
      SHALL attempt to recover.

   o  Initiators that request this feature and receive a KRB-ERROR2 with
      the ke-continue-needed e-flag set MUST attempt to recover and MUST
      produce a token to send to the acceptor: either a KRB-ERROR2 if
      the initiator failed to recover, or a new AP-REQ (with the
      traditional GSS-API pseudo-ASN.1 mechanism OID header).

      *  In the successful recovery case the initiator MUST quote the
         nonce from the KRB-ERROR2 using an AD-CHALLENGE-RESPONSE-NONCE
         (see below) authorization data element, and this MUST NOT be
         wrapped in an AD-IF-RELEVANT container.

   o  Initiators that support this feature and successfully recover from
      a KRB-ERROR or KRB-ERROR2 SHALL return GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED.
      Otherwise they MUST generate a KRB-ERROR to send to the acceptor
      and return an error to the application.

   The following Kerberos errors can be recovered from using this
   protocol:

   o  KRB_AP_ERR_TKT_EXPIRED: the initiator should get a new service
      ticket

   o  KRB_AP_ERR_TKT_NYV: the initiator should get a new service ticket

   o  KRB_AP_ERR_REPEAT: the initiator should build a new AP-REQ

   o  KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW: the initiator should build a new AP-REQ with time
      corrected for the offset between the initiator's and acceptor's
      clocks

   o  KRB_AP_ERR_BADKEYVER: the initiator should get a new service
      ticket

   o  KRB_AP_PATH_NOT_ACCEPTED: the initiator should get a new service
      ticket using a different transit path

   Error codes that denote PDU corruption (and/or an active attack) can
   also be recovered from by attempting a new AP-REQ:

   o  KRB_AP_ERR_BAD_INTEGRITY

   o  KRB_AP_ERR_BADVERSION

   o  KRB_AP_ERR_BADMATCH

   o  KRB_AP_ERR_MSG_TYPE

   o  KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED

   Other error codes that may be recovered from:

   o  KRB_AP_ERR_BADADDR; the acceptor SHOULD include a list of one or
      more client network addresses as reported by the operating system,
      but if the acceptor does not then the continue-needed e-flag MUST
      NOT be included and the error must be final.

   It is also possible for an acceptor to request that the initiator re-
   authenticate but to a different service principal, in which case the
   error code SHALL be KRB_AP_ERR_NOT_US, the KRB-ERROR2 encrypted part
   MUST be encrypted in the sub-session key from the Authenticator, and
   the sname and realm fields of the KRB-ERROR2 MUST be present.

2.1.  Use in Non-GSS Applications

   We only specify multiple round trips for the GSS mechanism and
   application case.  We believe that some non-GSS Kerberos applications
   may also benefit from this extension.

2.2.  Number of Round Trips

   At most two round trips should be needed in general.  Implementations
   SHOULD impose a limit of either two or three round trips.  An
   initiator that rejects an additional round-trip MUST respond with a
   KRB-ERROR2.

   Note that in the user-to-user cases (see Section 4.4) it's possible
   to have up to three round trips under normal conditions if, for
   example, the acceptor wishes to avoid the use of replay caches (see
   Section 4.3).

4.  Other Features

   Two other features are supported:

   o  acceptor name redirection;

   o  acceptor-issued service ticket (for the same acceptor name)
      issuance.

4.1.  Acceptor Name Redirection

   In some use cases, such as clusters, for example, an acceptor may
   wish to ask the initiator to use a different name (and ticket) for
   the acceptor.  This is indicated by setting the redir-srealm and
   redir-sname fields of a continue-needed KRB-ERROR2.  The KRB-ERROR2's
   enc-part MUST be encrypted in the initiator's sub-session key, and
   initiators MUST ignore the redir-srealm and redir-sname fields of any
   KRB-ERROR2 where the enc-part is encrypted in the null enc-type.

   Because the acceptor's name redirection is authenticated to the
   initiator, it is safe for the initiator to get a service ticket for
   the new name and re-try authentication with it.

4.2.  Fast Re-Authentication Acceptor Ticket Issuance

   In view of future extensions where the Kerberos AP protocol may be
   extended to use public key agreement protocols -which will likely be
   slow-, we provide a field in the KRB-ERROR2 where the acceptor may
   include a Ticket for itself, minted by the acceptor using a secret
   key of its choosing.  This service ticket may be used to speed up
   future otherwise-slow AP exchanges.

4.3.  Replay Cache Avoidance

   By using an additional round trip and a challenge/response nonce,
   this protocol is immune to replays of AP-REQ PDUs.  Acceptor
   implementations MAY not enter Authenticators from extra round trips
   into a replay cache when there are no other old implementations on
   the same host (and with access to the same acceptor credentials) that
   ignore critical authorization data or which don't know to reject
   initial AP-REQs that contain a challenge response nonce.

   By the same token, acceptors that support this feature MUST reject
   initial security context tokens that contain a challenge response
   nonce.

   Note that in the replay cache avoidance case, but where there's no
   actual error (e.g., time skew) the acceptor's KRB-ERROR2 will have



Williams & Dowdeswell    Expires August 19, 2013               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft              Kerberos Extra AP              February 2013


   KDC_ERR_NONE as the error code, with the continue-needed e-flag.

4.4.  User-to-User Authentication

   There are two user2user authentication cases:

   1.  the KDC only allows a service principal to use user2user
       authentication,

   2.  the service principal does not know its long-term keys or
       otherwise wants to use user2user authentication even though the
       KDC vended a service ticket.

   In the first case the initiator knows this because the KDC returns
   KDC_ERR_MUST_USE_USER2USER.  The initiator cannot make a valid AP-REQ
   in this case, yet it must send an AP-REQ or fail to make even an
   initial security context token.  For this case we propose that the
   initiator make an AP-REQ with invalid ticket (really, the enc-part of
   the Ticket will contain some OCTET STRING of length 1 or longer, but
   no longer than the minimum cipher-text length for the enc-type listed
   in the EncryptedData) and authenticator (an OCTET STRING of length 1
   or longer, but no longer than the minimum cipher-text length for some
   enc-type supported by the initiator).  The acceptor will fail to
   process the AP-REQ, of course, both because the Ticket and
   Authenticator embedded in it are not valid, and because the acceptor
   will likely not possess the key to decrypt a real Ticket.  The
   acceptor SHOULD respond with a continue-needed KRB-ERROR2 (using the
   null enc-type for the enc-part) that includes a TGT for the acceptor.

   In the second case the initiator does manage to get a real service
   ticket for the acceptor but the acceptor nonetheless wishes to use
   user2user authentication.  In this case the acceptor responds with a
   KRB-ERROR2, using either the null enc-type for the enc-part, or the
   initiator's sub-session key, and includes a TGT for itself.

   In both cases the initiator then does a TGS request with a second
   ticket to get a new, user2user Ticket.  Then the initiator makes a
   new AP-REQ using the new Ticket, and proceeds.

4.4.1.  Negotiation Issues for User-to-User Authentication

   Initiator applications that can negotiate security mechanisms and
   which have available an existing user-to-user mechanism
   [I-D.swift-win2k-krb-user2user] as well as the Kerberos V5 GSS
   mechanism with the user-to-user extension defined here will have a
   problem: they may end up negotiating the use of the Kerberos V5 GSS
   mechanism and fail to establish a security context because the
   acceptor does not support the features defined in this document, but

Internet-Draft              Kerberos Extra AP              February 2013


   the application might have succeeded if it had selected the user-to-
   user mechanism.

   [Question: how should we address this?  We could say "give priority
   to the user-to-user mechanism", but in some cases that might require
   changes to the acceptor side.  Should we just remove the use of user-
   to-user functionality?  We could remove half of the user-to-user
   functionality, the half that is triggered by
   KDC_ERR_MUST_USE_USER2USER KDC errors. -Nico]

Internet-Draft              Kerberos Extra AP              February 2013


5.  Other Requirements, Recommendations, and Non-Requirements

   All error PDUs in an AP exchange where the AP-REQ has the continue-
   needed-ok ap-options flag MUST be KRB-ERROR2 PDUs.

   Whenever an acceptor is able to decrypt the Ticket from an AP-REQ and
   yet wishes or has to output a KRB-ERROR2, then the enc-part of the
   KRB-ERROR2 MUST be encrypted in either the initiator's sub-session
   key (from the AP-REQ) or the Ticket's session key (if the acceptor
   could not decrypt the Authenticator), and the srealm and sname fields
   MUST be set to be the same as the realm and sname fields from the
   Ticket.

   Whenever an initiator receives a KRB-ERROR2 with enc-part encrypted
   in either the initiator's sub-session key or the Ticket's session
   key, then the initiator SHOULD check that the srealm and sname fields
   of the KRB-ERROR2 encrypted part match the ones used in the
   initiator's AP-REQ's Ticket (XXX what should the initiator do if
   these don't match?!).

6.  Application Compatibility Note

   Some GSS-API applications assume that no more than one round trip is
   required for security context token establishment.  Most such
   applications will fail safe if GSS_Init_sec_context() or
   GSS_Accept_sec_context() return GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED when they
   expect GSS_S_COMPLETE -- such applications already should be able to
   handle errors in this case.  Such applications will fail to interop
   when used with initiator and acceptor mechanism implementations that
   support these extensions if the acceptor mechanism decides to use
   extra round trips.  Acceptor mechanism implementors might wish to
   provide a configuration option for disabling extra round trips.

7.  Differences from "DCE style"

   [XXX Add text explaining what DCE style is as well as a reference.]

   There are four differences between this protocol extension and "DCE
   style", three of which are consequential:

   1.  DCE style is selected by the initiator _application_ via a
       request flag.

   2.  DCE style is, in practice, mandatory for the acceptor to
       implement, else interop fails.  Because of difference #4 (see
       below), initiators could detect that the acceptor did not
       understand the DCE style flag and recover, but in practice they
       do not.

   3.  This extension is a) transparent to applications, b) generic,
       allowing for arbitrary round trips for arbitrary purposes.
       Indeed, this extension supports a number of additional features
       beyond DCE style's replay cache avoidance: error recovery, user-
       to-user authentication, and others (see above).

8.  Security Considerations

   This document deals with security.

   [XXX Note the resource using attacks that are feasible when we have
   multiple round-trips and note that they are nothing new and nothing
   to worry about because services should already have timeouts on pre-
