Internet-Draft     Automatic VLAN allocation in E-tree     February 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document proposes to use automatically allocated VLAN ID to
   indicate E-Tree attribute.  For the E-Tree requirement, please refer
   to [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-etree-reqt] for detail.

   In order to achieve better compatibility and traffic optimization,
   this document also introduces extensions to existing VPLS protocols
   as described in the document.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.


3.  Approach

   In order to compatible with IEEE defined E-Tree, the approach in this
   draft uses the VLAN ID to indicate Root/Leaf attribute of the frame.

   There are two ways to manipulating VLANs for an E-Tree in VPLS:
   o  Unlike static configuring VLAN in IEEE, VPLS PE has the capability
      to create VLAN ID automatically, e.g.  The VLAN ID can be derived
      from the PW type/AGI automatically via some algorithm;
   o  Two officially assigned global VLAN ID are allocated by IETF/IEEE,
      and the two VLAN ID indicate Root VLAN, Leaf VLAN respectively.

   In this document, only the first method is discussed.

   Unlike static configuring VLAN ID in IEEE, VPLS PE has the capability
   to create VLAN ID automatically, e.g.The VLAN ID can be derived from
   the PW type/AGI automatically via some algorithm.  As part of VLAN
   auto-derive procedure, operators only need to configure the PW type
   and the AC Leaf/Root properties, and not necessary to care about the
   exact VLAN number.  One VLAN ID(Root VLAN ID) is used to indicate the
   frame originated from the Root AC and another VLAN ID(Leaf VLAN ID)
   is used to indicate the frame originated from the Leaf AC between the
   pair of the PEs.

                                 Figure 1

   As shown in figure 1, the VPLS PE1 and PE2 can both be attached with
   root/leaf AC, the VLANs which is used to indicate the Root/leaf can
   be derived from the PW type/AGI automatically.

   When PE1 receives a frame via the Root AC, PE1 can add the Root VLAN
   ID.  When PE2 receives the frame from PE1 via the Ethernet PW, PE2
   knows the frame originated from the Root, so it can forward the frame
   to AC3(Root AC) and AC4 (Leaf AC).

   When PE1 receives a frame via the Leaf AC, PE1 can add the leaf VLAN
   ID.  When PE2 receives the frame from PE1 via the Ethernet PW, PE2
   knows the frame originated from the Leaf, so it can forward the frame
   to AC3 (Root AC) but it must not be forwarded to any Leaf AC.

   The approach allows the egress PE to make a decision whether the
   frame can be forwarded or dropped towards a leaf AC.  But in some
   special scenarios, e.g. one of the VPLS PE is attached with only
   leaves, some optimization should be done on the ingress PE to make a
   decision whether this frame should be forwarded or dropped.  Such
   kind of mechanism can improve the bandwidth efficiency.  The
   extension to VPLS for the PE attached with leaves only is defined in
   section 5.


4.  Allocation mechanism

   As part of VLAN auto-derive procedure, each PE can only need to
   configure the Leaf/Root properties for each AC.  Both the PWid FEC
   element and the Generalized PWid FEC Element can be used to set up
   the VPLS as defined in [RFC4762].  "MOD" operation is used to get
   Leaf/Root VLAN ID.

   o  Root ID = (ID) MOD 4094 + 1;
   o  Leaf ID = (ID) MOD 4094 + 2.

   For the PWid FEC element, if all PWs within VPLS use same PWid, PWid
   could be used as the ID, otherwise, PW type could be used as the ID.

   For the Generalized PWid FEC, AGI/PW type is used as ID, and AGI is
   defined in [RFC5003].  AGI as a VPLS ID would be the same at a
   particular VPLS instance, and every PE uses the same "mod" operation
   to obtain Leaf/Root VLAN from the VPLS ID.  So every PE in the same
   VPLS instance obtains the same Root/Leaf VLAN.

   In figure 1, assume PE1 and PE2 configure the same PW type 0X0005.
   PE1 and PE2 do the "mod" operation: PW type 0X0005 mod 4094, the
   calculation result of "6" indicates the frame originated from the
   Root, and the calculation result of "7" indicates the frame
   originated from the Leaf.


5.   Extension to LDP-VPLS for E-tree support

   In addition to the signaling procedures for setting up PW as
   specified in RFC4447, one new PW interface parameter sub-TLV,the
   E-tree sub-TLV, is defined to use in E-Tree VPLS.

   The E-tree sub-TLV is defined as follows:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | E-tree (IANA) |    Length     |           Reserved          |P|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |          TPID(optional)       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                                 Figure 2

   In the above figure, reserved bit must be set to 0 when transmitting,
   and must be ignored upon receive.  P bit is used to flag the PE which
   is attached with only leaves as follows:
   o  P=1: the PE is attached with only leaves;
   o  P=0: the PE is attached with roots and leaves or is attached with
      only roots.

   For TPID, it is optional.  In various implementations, the TPID is
   configurable, if the E-Tree VLAN uses different TPID, it will lead

   some confusion.

   If a new TPID value for E-tree is allocated by IEEE, then it is not
   necessary to be negotiated in the E-tree sub-TLV.

   Otherwise, the TPID should be 16-bit.

   Editor's note: it is required for IETF to request IEEE TPID code for
   E-Tree if this draft is accepted.

   This TLV must be carried in label mapping message.  If a PE supports
   E-tree service, it must send this E-tree sub-TLV and include its
   local TPID value.  A PE is attached with only leaves should set the P
   bit to 1.

   When a PE2 that received such a Label mapping message from its peer
   PE1, it knows that the PE1 has the E-tree capability.  PE2 should
   check if the local configure match the TPID value that carried in the
   Label mapping message, and if PE1 is attached with only leaves.


6.  Extension to BGP-VPLS for E-tree support

   This will be added in later version.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates a new interface parameter sub-TLV types (E-tree
   sub-TLV) that is allocated by IANA, and a value of 0X18 is suggested
   for assignment with this sub-TLV.
