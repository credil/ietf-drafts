Abstract

   This document defines an extension to Label Distribution Protocol
   (LDP) [RFC5036] for implementation of multiple LDP instances in a
   network node, where all such instances share the common data plane.
   Multiple LDP instances provide a method for operators for fate
   separation of various LDP FEC Types as well as for network
   segmentation.  The methods defined in this extension are backward
   compatible with procedures defined in [RFC5036]

Internet-Draft             Multi-Instance LDP                 April 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) architecture is described
   in [RFC3031].  Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is a signaling
   protocol for setup and maintenance of MPLS LSPs (Label Switched
   Paths) and the protocol specification is defined in [RFC5036].

   Two Label Switched Routers (LSR) that use LDP to exchange label/FEC
   mapping information are known as "LDP Peers" with respect to that
   information, and we speak of there being an "LDP Session" between
   them.  A single LDP session allows each peer to learn the other's
   label mappings.  Each LSR is indentified by an LDP identifier.  An
   LDP Identifier is a six octet quantity used to identify an LSR label
   space.  The 4 octets identify the LSR and is a globally unique value,
   such as a 32-bit router Id assigned to the LSR.  The last two octets
   identify a specific label space within the LSR.  The last two octets
   of LDP Indentifers for platform-wide label spaces are always both
   zero.  This document uses the following representation for LDP
   Indentifiers:

   <LSR Id> : <label space id>

   e.g, lsr171:0, lsr19:2 etc

   As per [RFC5036] an LSR that manages and advertises multiple label
   spaces uses a different LDP Identifier for each such label space.
   This means for a single label space there can be only one router-id
   that is can be assigned to the node that exclusively owns that label
   space.  For example, it is not possible to have two LSRs like
   lsr100:0 and lsr200:0 to be created in the a single node.

   A LDP peering session between two LSRs may exchange labels for
   setting up LSPs that may belong to different FEC types.  Operators
   may need the flexiblity for fate separation of different FEC types in
   LDP protocol signaling when all such fec types share the same common
   label space.  This is not possible with the current paradigm of
   single peering session between two LSRs and it requires one session
   per fate separated group of FEC types to exchange labels.  Thus
   multiple LDP sessions are required between two peering nodes.  One
   example could be fate separation between IP transport network and the
   overlay network of Pseudowires (PW).  Procedures for PW set-up and
   maintenance using LDP are defined in [RFC4447].  It may be also
   desirable for fate separation IPv4 and IPv6 LSP set-up and
   maintenance in LDP in case of which two separate LDP sessions need to
   be formed between two peering nodes.

   Although [RFC5036] does not specify that the 4 byte router-id of the
   LDP identifier be routable IP addresses, for various operational

   simplicity implementations may map the 32 bit router-id to a IPv4
   address configured in the node which is routable.  In that way
   uniqueness of the 4 byte router-id can be achieved over a single
   routing domain.  Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) like OSPF provide
   the option of creation of multiple instances for segmentation of a
   network into multiple routing domains.  When LDP is deployed in such
   networks it is required to segment LDP network to align with multiple
   routing domains.  When a node is connected to multiple such domains,
   LDP peering sessions over all such domains cannot use a common IPv4
   router-id which is local to that node, since the IPv4 mapped
   router-id may not be routable across all such domains for security
   purposes.  There are applications such as BGP Autodiscovery of L2VPNs
   or Dynamic MS-PW set-up that may auto-instantiate Targeted LDP
   sessions where BGP IPv4 next-hop addresses for respective NLRIs are
   mapped to peer LDP identifiers.  Suc next-hop addresses may not be
   routable between two routing domains.Thus there is need to host
   multiple LSRs by a network node that shares the same label space but
   each with unique router-ids.

   This document describes a method to implement multiple instances of
   LDP in a network node that shares same label space.  The method is
   generic and is backward compatible with nodes that supports
   procedures defined in [RFC5036] but does not support the procedures
   defined in this document.  The procedures defined in this document
   would be referred as "Multi-Instance LDP".


2.  Multiple LDP Instances

   The solution defines the concept of implementing multiple LDP
   instances on a single network node that shares the single label space
   and thus shares the common data plane.  Each such LDP instance is
   identified by a unique 4 byte router-id but same label space.  Since
   the multi-instance procedures use same LDP Indentifer as defined in
   [RFC5036], it makes the node running multiple instances to be
   backward compatible with the node that support the multi-instance LDP
   procedures.

2.1.  Procedures for multi-instance peering

   When multiple LDP instances are set-up between two peering nodes for
   fate separation reasons then there can be various ways Hello
   adjacencies can be formed over the interfaces between the nodes.
   Further multi-instance peering for fate separation results in
   multiple parallel sessions between two peering nodes.

   While running parallel multi-instance LDP sessions between two
   peering nodes,

   1.  Each peering sesssion MUST use separate transport address.

   2.  The FEC label mappings exchanged over each peering session MUST
   be a disjoint set from one another.

   The above rules does not apply between multi-instance LDP sessions
   with different peering LDP nodes.

   This document describes the following cases and defines the rules and
   procedures with each case.

2.1.1.  Case 1


           Node - A                                    Node - B
       +-------------+                            +--------------+
       |   LSR-A1:0--|============IF 1============|---LSR-B1:0   |
       |           \ |                            | /            |
       |   LSR-A2:0  |============IF 2============|   LSR-B2:0   |
       +-------|-----+                            +-------|------+
               +---------------t-LDP Adj------------------+

                                   Figure 1.


   In this case the operator wants to separate the fate of FECs
   exchanged between the nodes into two separate groups - Group 1 and
   Group 2.  For example Group 1 can contain all transport specific FEC
   types such as IPV4 FEC Element Type and LDP Multi-point (MP) FEC
   types etc.  LDP Multi-point FEC types are described in [RFC6388] .
   Group 2 contains various Pseudowire (PW) FEC types.  PW setup and
   maintenance using LDP is described in [RFC4447].

   Two separate LSR-IDs are provisioned in each node - one LSR is
   dedicated for FEC Group 1 and another for FEC Group 2.

   There are two parallel interfaces between Node-A and Node-B as IF1
   and IF2 respectively.

   The traffic for LSPs set-up for FEC Group 1 may use both IF1 and IF2.
   Thus both IF1 and IF2 would exchange Hello Packets using LSR-A1:0 and
   LSR-A2:0 for setting up Hello adjacency for the LDP instance assigned
   for FEC Group 1.  The Hello messages exchanged over IF1 and IF2 MUST
   carry the LDP Adjacency Capabilities for each FEC Types in FEC Group
   1.  LDP Adjacency Capabilities are defined in [LDP-ADJ-CAP].  This
   would result in formation of a LDP session between Node A and Node B
   for the instance indentified by LSR-A1:0 and LSR-B1:0 respectively.
   The LDP session SHOULD be set-up with Capabilities of FEC Group 1.

   LDP session specific capability negotiation is described in [RFC5561]

   A Targeted LDP (t-LDP) hello adjacency would be formed between node A
   and node B using LSR-A2:0 and LSR-B2:0 respectively.  The t-Ldp Hello
   Messages exchanged between the nodes MUST carry the LDP Adjacency
   Capabilities for each FEC Types in FEC Group 2.  This would result in
   a LDP session between Node A and Node B for the instance identified
   by LSR-A2:0 and LSR-B2:0 respectively.  The LDP session SHOULD be
   set-up with capabilities of FEC Group 2.

2.1.2.  Case 2


          Node - A                                   Node - B
       +-------------+                           +--------------+
       |   LSR-A1:0--|===========IF 1============|---LSR-B1:0   |
       |           x |                           | x            |
       |   LSR-A2:0--|===========IF 2============|---LSR-B2:0   |
       |             |                           |              |
       |   LSR-A3:0  |---------t-LDP Adj---------|   LSR-B3:0   |
       +-------------+                           +--------------+

                                   Figure 2.


   This is a variant of case 1 where the operator may choose to further
   separate the fate of IPV4 FEC Element Type and MP FEC Element types
   into "Unicast" and "Multicast" Groups.  Thus there are three FEC
   Groups here and fate separation is required for all three FEC Groups.

   FEC Group 1 : IPv4 FEC Element Type.

   FEC Group 2: MP FEC Element Types.

   FEC Group 3: PW FEC Element Types.

   LDP Instance 1: The LDP instance with peering LSR-A1:0 and LSR-B1:0
   are assigned for FEC Group 1.

   LDP Instance 2: The LDP Instance with peering LSR-A2:0 and LSR-B2:0
   are assigned for FEC Group 2.

   LDP Instance 3: The LDP instance with peering LSR-A3:0 and LSR-B3:0
   are assigned for FEC Group 3.

   In this case, both IF1 and IF2 are associated with LDP instances 1
   and 2.  Each of IF1 and IF2 would originate two separate Hello
   Messages using the same source IP address, one Hello Message for each

   instance .  This would result in two hello adjacencies per interface
   - one for Instance 1 and Instance 2.  Each Hello Adjacncies SHOULD
   advertise capabilities using rules described in case 1.

   Such case may also arise when operator wants to do fate separation of
   IPV4 and IPV6 LDP based LSPs but IF1 and IF2 are single stack
   interfaces only - that is either IPV4 or IPV6.  Thus an operator may
   provision single stack interfaces IF1 and IF2 and yet can provision
   fate separation of IPV4 and IPV6 LSPs.

   The t-Ldp Hello Adjacency would be formed for LDP Instance 3 using
   the PW Capabilities.

2.1.3.  Case 3


           Node - A                                     Node - B
       +-------------+                              +--------------+
       |   LSR-A1:0--|============IF 1==============|---LSR-B1:0   |
       |           x |                              | x            |
       |   LSR-A2:0--|============IF 2==============|---LSR-B2:0   |
       |             |                              |              |
       +-------------+                              +--------------+

                                    Figure 3.


   This case a a variant of case 2 where, both interfaces IF1 and IF2
   are dual-stack (IPV4 and IPV6) interfaces and operator wants fate
   separation of IPV4 and IPV6 LSPs.  Without loss of generality,
   herebys IPv4 or IPV6 FECs may include all FEC types that are
   associated with IPV4 or IPV6.  For example,
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-in-band-signaling] defines several in-band MP FEC
   Types that may be classified into IPV6.

   LDP Instance 1: The LDP instance with peering LSR-A1:0 and LSR-B1:0
   are assigned for IPV4 FEC Types.

   LDP Instance 2: The LDP Instance with peering LSR-A2:0 and LSR-B2:0
   are assigned for IPV6 FEC Types.

   Both the interfaces IF1 and IF2 are associated with each of the LDP
   instances 1 and 2 respectively.  Here the operator may choose to use
   IPv4 addresses on the interfaces for sending Hello Messages for
   Instance 1 and IPv6 addresses on the interfaces for sending Hello
   Messages for Instance 2.

2.1.4.  Case 4

   This case is variant of case 3 where inteface IF1 is dedicated for
   IPV4 LSP Types and IF2 is dedicated for IPV6 LSP Types.  This
   provides fate-separation of both control plane and data plane for LSP
   types.


3.  Detection of multi-instance peering

   While running parallel multi-instance LDP sessions between two
   peering nodes, it is important to detect that such sessions with the
   same peer node.  If a node receives the same FEC label maping from
   parallel multi-lsr peering sessions it may result in a loop for some
   applications.  An example of such application can be LDP based
   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)described [RFC4762].  So it is
   important to detect and prevent such loops.

   This document defines a new LDP Node-ID TLV that uniquely indentifies
   the node that hosts multiple LDP instances.  The LDP Node ID TLV is
   OPTIONAL and is carried in LDP Hello Messages sent out by the node in
   its Optional Parameters.  The encoding of the LDP Node ID TLV is as
   follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |1|0| Node ID Tlv (TBD)         |            Length (6)         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                             Value                             |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |        Value (contd)          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                     Figure 4


   The Value field is a 48 bit identifier and MUST be unique identifer
   across the network.

   1.  All the multi-instance LDP LSRs MUST advertise the same LDP
   Node-ID TLV in all Hello Messages originated by that node.  One
   example of the value can be a IEEE Vendor specific MAC Address that
   can uniquely indentify a node in the network.

   2.  When a LSR receives a FEC label mapping from a peering session
   but same FEC mapping has been already receiver over another peering
   session associated with same Node-ID then the receiving LSR MUST send
   a Label Release to the peering session with statuc code

   LOOP_DETECTED.


4.  LDP Address Distribution with multi-instance peering

   An LSR maintains learned labels in a Label Information Base (LIB).
   When operating in Downstream Unsolicited mode, the LIB entry for an
   address prefix associates a collection of (LDP Identifier, label)
   pairs with the prefix, one such pair for each peer advertising a
   label for the prefix.  When the next hop for a prefix changes, the
   LSR retrieves the label advertised by the new next hop from the LIB
   for use in forwarding.  To retrieve the label, the LSR should be able
   to map the next hop address for the prefix to an LDP Identifier.
   Similarly, when the LSR learns a label for a prefix from an LDP peer,
   it should be able to determine whether that peer is currently a next
   hop for the prefix to determine whether it needs to start using the
   newly learned label when forwarding packets that match the prefix.
   To make that decision, the LSR should be able to map an LDP
   Identifier to the peer's addresses to check whether any are a next
   hop for the prefix.  To enable LSRs to map between a peer LDP
   Identifier and the peer's addresses, LSRs advertise their addresses
   using LDP Address and Withdraw Address messages as per procedures
   defined in [RFC5036]

   However while running multi-instance LDP peering between two nodes,
   it is possible that all such sessions would distribute same set of
   local addresses in each node.  An implementation MAY segregate the
   local address space in each node among the multiple ldp instances to
   avoid duplication of address distribution.


5.  LDP State Sharing between instances

   TBD.


6.  Applicability

   This solution described in this document is applicable for multi-
   instance LDP sessions for fate separation as well as for segmentation
   of LDP network domains.  More details would be covered in next
   revisions of the document.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


8.  Security Considerations

   [I-D.ietf-mpls-mpls-and-gmpls-security-framework] describes the
   security framework for MPLS networks. whereas [RFC5036] describes the
   security considerations that apply to the base LDP specification.
   The same security framework and considerations apply to the
   capability mechansim described in this document.


9.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Wim Henderickx for insightful
   comments and probing questions.
