 Interconnecting IPv6 Multicast Islands over IPv4 Using IPv6 Multicast
                         Provider Edge Routers
            draft-wang-mboned-glo-ipv6-mcast-reachability-01

Abstract

   This draft presents a method to interconnect IPv6 multicast islands
   over an IPv4 cloud.  This method relies on IPv6 Multicast Provider
   Edge routers (6MPE), which support Dual-Stack and in order to connect
   IPv6 multicast islands to the IPv4 core.  The 6MPE routers extend the
   Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol(MP-BGP), define a new Network
   Layer Reachability Information(NLRI) called MCAST-IPv6 NLRI, and
   exchange the IPv6 multicast reachability information transparently
   over the IPv4 core using the MP-BGP.

1.  Introduction

   There is already an approach for providing IPv6 connectivity over an
   IPv4 core network named Softwire Mesh Multicast, however, this
   approach results in inefficient bandwidth and resource utilization.
   And there is also already an approach for providing IPv4/IPv6
   connectivity over VPN core network name MVPN[RFC6513] and MVPN-
   BGP[RFC6514], however, this approach just provides VPN service over
   IPv4/IPv6 network.  The approach used in this document named IPv6
   Multicast Provider Edge (6MPE) is a MVPN-like solution which connects
   non-VPN IPv6 multicast islands over IPv4 core network.

   The 6MPE approach specified in this document requires that the edge
   routers (the 6MPE routers) be connected to IPv6 multicast islands and
   support Dual-Stack Multiprotocol-BGP, and the core routers run IPv4
   only.  And can be used for customers that already have an IPv4
   multicast service from the network provider and additionally require
   an IPv6 multicast service, as well as for customers that require only
   IPv6 connectivity.

   The 6MPE approach specified in this document defines a new Network
   Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)[RFC4760], MCAST-IPv6 NLRI.  The
   MCAST-IPv6 NLRI is used for 6MPE routers auto-discovery, advertising
   IPv6 islands multicast routing information exchange among 6MPE
   routers.

   Note that the 6MPE approach specified in this document provides
   global IPv6 reachability.  Deployment of the 6MPE approach over an
   existing IPv4 cloud does not require an introduction of new
   mechanisms in the core.  Configurations and operations of the 6MPE
   approach have a lot of similarities with the configurations and
   operations of an IPv4 MVPN service or IPv6 MVPN service ([RFC6513]
   and [RFC6514]).  However, the configuration and operations of the
   6MPE approach are somewhat simpler, since it does not involve all the
   VPN concepts such as Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRFs) tables,RD
   and aggregation etc.

   This document cites the format of Route Type defined in MCAST-VPN
   NLRI and modifies the format to adapt MCAST-IPv6 NLRI, which
   discussed in following sections in details.

   This document cites the PMSI Tunnel Attribute defined in MVPN-BGP
   (RFC6514) and modifies the format to adapt tunnel attribute defined
   in 6MPE approach, which discussed in following section in details.

   This document cites a BGP Extended Communities defined in MVPN: the
   source Autonomous System (AS) Extended Community.

   In this document an "IPv6 multicast island" is a network running
   native IPv6 multicast.  A typical example of an IPv6 multicast island
   would be a customer's IPv6 site connected via its IPv6 Customer Edge
   (CE) to one (or more) Dual-Stack Multicast Provider Edge router(s) of
   a Service Provider.  These IPv6 Multicast Provider Edge routers
   (6MPE) are connected to an IPv4 core network.  Corresponding scenario
   sees figure 1.

2.  Keywords and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Terminology, and Definition of Terms

   In the context of this document, we will refer to the 6MPE auto-
   discovery/binding information carried in BGP as "6MPE A-D routes".
   And there are the following types of 6MPE A-D routes:

      + Intra-AS 6MPE A-D route;

      + Inter-AS 6MPE A-D route;

      + 4-MSI 6MPE A-D route;

      + Leaf 6MPE A-D route;

      + Source Active 6MPE A-D route;

   In the context of this document, we will refer to the 6MPE customers
   multicast routing information carried in BGP as "IPv6-multicast
   routes".  And there are the following types of IPv6-multicast routes:

      + (*,G) Join route;

      + (S,G) Join route;

3.  MCAST-IPv6 NLRI

   This document defines a new BGP NLRI, called the MCAST-IPv6 NLRI.
   The format of the MCAST-IPv6 NLRI is the same as MCAST-VPN NLRI and
   the Route Types for 6MPE A-D routes are as follow:

      +1 Intra-AS 6MPE A-D route;

      +2 Inter-AS 6MPE A-D route;

      +3 4-MSI 6MPE A-D route;

      +4 Leaf 6MPE A-D route;

      +5 Source Active 6MPE A-D route;

      +6 (*,G) Join route;

      +7 (S,G) Join route;

   The MCAST-IPv6 NLRI is carried in BGP using BGP Multiprotocol
   Extensions with Address Family Identifier(AFI) of 2 and a Subsequent
   AFI(SAFI) of MCAST-IPv6.

   In order for two BGP speakers to exchange MCAST-IPv6 NLRIs, they must
   use a BGP Capabilities Advertisement to ensure that they both are
   capable of properly processing such an NLRI.  This is done as
   specified in [RFC4760], by using capability code 1 with an AFI of 2
   and an SAFI of MCAST-IPv6.

   The format of the Route Type specific MCAST-IPv6 NLRI for various
   Route Types defined in this document cite from MVPN, except remove
   the RD field in each Route Type and replace the Originating Router's
   IP Addr with 6MPE Router-ID.

   6MPE Router-ID uniquely identifies a 6MPE router.

4.  Tunnel Attribute

   This document can define and use a new BGP attribute called the
   "IPv4-Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (4-MSI) attribute" which is
   like PMSI Tunnel Attribute defined in MVPN but remove the MPLS Label
   field or reuse PMSI Tunnel Attribute but set the MPLS Label field
   invalid value.

   The Tunnel Type and the usage are the same as the Tunnel Type in PMSI
   Tunnel attribute.

5.  Protocol Overview

   Interconnection of IPv6 multicast islands over an IPv4 network is
   achieved by executing the following steps:

   1.  The 6MPE routers MUST have auto-discovery/binding
   mechanism[RFC6513 and RFC6514] to discovery other 6MPE routers, and
   trigger IPv4 cloud to build inclusive IPv4-multicast service tunnel
   as necessary.

   2.  Exchange IPv6 multicast routing reachability information among
   6MPE routers.

   3.  Trigger IPv4 cloud to build selective IPv4-multicast service
   tunnel.

   In executing step 1-3, the 6MPE routers convey the IPv4 address of
   6MPE Router-ID as the BGP Next Hop for the advertised A-D routes.
   And the IPv4 address MUST be encoded as an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
   in the BGP Next Hop field.  This encoding is consistent with the
   definition of an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address in [RFC4291].

   4.  Binding IPv6 multicast islands' multicast tree to selective IPv4-
   multicast service tunnel.

   5.  Transport IPv6 multicast packets from the ingress 6MPE router
   which is nearby the IPv6 multicast source to the egress 6MPE routers
   which are nearby the multicast receivers over IPv4-multicast service
   tunnel.
