        <t>This document describes a mechanism for compressing streams of groups of key-value pairs, often known as Headers in an HTTP session. See <xref target="RFC2616">RFC 2616</xref> or successors for more information about headers.</t>

      <section anchor="intro" title="Overview">
        <t>There have been several problems pointed out with the use of the gzip compressor in <xref target="SPDY">SPDY</xref>. The biggest of these problems is that it is possible for a smart attacker to inject content into the compressor, and then to test hypotheses about the prior contents of the compressor by examining the output size after each such content injection. The other issue is that gzip often consumes more CPU than many would like, especially in situations where one is doing forward or reverse proxying. The compressor proposed here intends to solve the first issue and significantly mitigate the second, while providing compression that is not too much worse than gzip.</t>

				<t> A complete set of headers has only been expressed when the HEADERS frame has the HEADERS_DONE bit set to true. If the headers being serialized do not fit into one HEADERS frame, the HEADERS_DONE flag for all but the last HEADERS frame MUST be set to false</t>
				<t> There are alternate serializations which have various interesting properties. Here are some interesting variations among these alternatives:
          <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
					<t> Serialize all constant-length information before serializing any string data. This allows for a clear separation of byte-aligned vs. potentially non-byte-aligned data</t>
					<t> Have explicit sections for each opcode type, with a sentinel denoting the end of each range of opcode. Since the number of opcode types is small, this could reduce the overhead consumed in repeating the opcode.</t>
					<t> As above, but have a count for the number of each opcode instead of using a sentinel</t>
					<t> Use huffman coding on the entire payload of the HEADERS frame, not just the strings. TOGGLES are far more common than other operations, and using fewer bits for these could be beneficial</t>

      <section title="Operations">
        <t> Toggle: This encodes a single ValIdx, which, if already present in the HeaderGroup associated with the current HEADERS frame, will be removed, else added. If added, then the LRU entry which the index references MUST be moved to the head of the LRU.</t>
        <t> ToggleRange: This incodes two ValIdx, denoting an inclusive range of ValIdx which shall be toggled as per the Toggle operation, above.</t>
        <t> Clone: This encodes a KeyIdx which references a pre-existing key, and references a new string. The Clone operation inserts a new ValEntry into the ValMap associated with the KeyMap entry identified by the KeyIdx. The ValIdx for this new ValEntry is the ++current_val_idx; The new ValEntry MUST be inserted at the head of the LRU.</t>
        <t> KVSto: This encodes a new key string and new value string. The key will be inserted into the KeyMap, and assigned a new KeyIdx. The value string will be inserted into the Valmap associated with the KeyMap entry that was just added. As with Clone, a new unique ValIdx will be associated with it in a monotonically increasing sequence by using the value of ++current_val_idx. The new ValEntry MUST be inserted at the head of the LRU.</t>
        <t> Eref: This encodes a key and value literal which, while interpreted as part of the header frame, doesn't cause any persistent change in the compressor state. ERef stands for "ephemereal reference".</t>

        <section title="Security Considerations">
          <t> The compressor algorithm described here is expected to be immune to the current attacks against encrypted stream-based compressors such as TLS+gzip, but more scrutiny is warranted. The reason that it is believed that the algorithm(s) expressed here is immune is that any backreference to a header key or value always requires a whole-text match, and thus any probe of the compression context confirms no hypothesis unless the attacker has guessed the entire plaintext. </t>
