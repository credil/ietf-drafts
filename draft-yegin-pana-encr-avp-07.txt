Internet-Draft             PANA AVP Encryption               August 2012


1.  Introduction

   PANA [RFC5191] is a UDP-based protocol to perform EAP authentication
   between a PaC (PANA Client) and a PAA (PANA Authentication Agent).

   Various types of payloads are exchanged as part of the network access
   authentication and authorization.  These payloads are carried in
   AVPs.  AVPs can be integrity-protected using the AUTH AVP when EAP
   authentication generates cryptographic keying material.  PANA AVPs
   are transmitted in the clear (i.e., not encrypted).

   There are certain types of payloads that need to be delivered
   privately (e.g., network keys, private identifiers, etc.).  This
   document defines a mechanism for applying encryption to selected
   AVPs.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Details

   Encr-Encap AVP is used for delivering AVPs in encrypted form.

   Each AVP that requires encryption SHALL be encapsulated inside an
   Encr-Encap AVP.  Encr-Encap AVP can encapsulate one or more AVPs.
   There SHALL be only one Encr-Encap AVP in a PANA message.

   Encr-Encap AVP uses the PANA_ENCR_KEY and the encryption algorithm
   negotiated by the Encr-Algorithm AVP.  These AVPs SHALL NOT be used
   if the EAP method does not generate cryptographic keys (more
   specifically, MSK).

   When encryption needs to be used, the required algorithm is
   negotiated as follows: the PAA SHALL send the initial PANA-Auth-
   Request carrying one or more Encryption-Algorithm AVPs supported by
   it.  The PaC SHALL select one of the algorithms from this AVP, and it
   SHALL respond with the initial PANA-Auth-Answer carrying one
   Encryption-Algorithm AVP for the selected algorithm.

   Encr-Encap AVP MAY be used in any PANA message once the encryption
   algorithm is successfully negotiated and the PANA_ENCR_KEY is
   generated.  Therefore, the EAP method MUST be a key-generating EAP

   method and the first message an Encr-Encap AVP MAY be used in is the
   last PANA-Auth-Request message with the 'C' (Complete) bit set.

   The PRF used for computing the PANA_ENCR_KEY SHALL be negotiated by
   the PRF-Algorithm-AVP according to [RFC5191].


3.  Encryption Key

   PANA_ENCR_KEY is used for encrypting the AVP payload of the Encr-
   Encap AVP.  PANA_ENCR_KEY SHALL be computed according to the
   following formula.

     PANA_ENCR_KEY = prf+(MSK, "IETF PANA Encryption Key" | I_PAR |
                          I_PAN | PaC_nonce | PAA_nonce | Key_ID)



   where:

      - The prf+ function is defined in IKEv2 [RFC5996].  The pseudo-
      random function to be used for the prf+ function is negotiated
      using PRF-Algorithm AVP in the initial PANA-Auth-Request and PANA-
      Auth-Answer exchange with 'S' (Start) bit set.

      - MSK is the master session key generated by the EAP method.

      - "IETF PANA Encryption Key" is the ASCII code representation of
      the non-NULL terminated string (excluding the double quotes around
      it).

      - I_PAR and I_PAN are the initial PANA-Auth-Request and PANA-Auth-
      Answer messages (the PANA header and the following PANA AVPs) with
      'S' (Start) bit set, respectively.

      - PaC_nonce and PAA_nonce are values of the Nonce AVP carried in
      the first non-initial PANA-Auth-Answer and PANA-Auth-Request
      messages in the authentication and authorization phase or the
      first PANA-Auth-Answer and PANA-Auth-Request messages in the re-
      authentication phase, respectively.

      - Key_ID is the value of the Key-Id AVP.

   The length of PANA_ENCR_KEY depends on the encryption algorithm in
   use.

4.  Encryption-Algorithm AVP

   The Encryption-Algorithm AVP (AVP code TBD1) is used for conveying
   the encryption algorithm to be used with the Encr-Encap AVP.  The AVP
   value data is of type Unsigned32.

   Only encryption algorithm identifier AES128_CTR (code 1) is
   identified by this document.  Encryption algorithm identifier values
   other than 1 are reserved for future use.  Future specifications are
   allowed to extend this list.

      AES128_CTR: 1

      AES-CTR (Counter) encryption algorithm as specified in
      [NIST_SP800_38A] using AES-128 block cipher.  The formatting
      function and counter generation function as specified in Appendix
      A of [NIST_SP800_38C] are used, with the following parameters:


            n = 12,
            q = 3


      The 12-octet nonce consists of a 4-octet Key-Id, a 4-octet Session
      ID and a 4-octet Sequence Number in that order where each 4-octet
      value is encoded in network byte order.  The Session ID and
      Sequence Number values SHALL be the same as those in the PANA
      message carrying the key Encr-Encap AVP.  The Key-Id value SHALL
      be the same as the one used for deriving the PANA_ENCR_KEY.  The
      output blocks of the encryption processing are encoded as
      OctetString data in the Value field of a Encr-Encap AVP.

      Note the first counter block used for encryption is Ctr_1, where
      "_1" denotes "subscript 1" as described in section A.3 of
      [NIST_SP800_38C].  For example, given the following:


            Key-Id = 0x55667788,
            Session ID = 0xaabbccdd,
            Sequence Number = 0x11223344


      The first counter block used for encryption will be:


            0x0255667788aabbccdd11223344000001

Internet-Draft             PANA AVP Encryption               August 2012


      where the initial 0x02 represents the Flags Field of the counter
      block.

   In the absence of an application profile specifying otherwise, all
   implementations SHALL support AES128_CTR.


5.  Encr-Encap AVP

   The Encr-Encap AVP (AVP code TBD2) is used to encrypt one or more
   PANA AVPs.  Format of the Encr-Encap AVP depends on the negotiated
   encryption algorithm.

   When the negotiated encryption algorithm identifier is AES128_CTR
   (code 1), AVP data payload is occupied by the encrypted AVPs.


6.  Encryption Policy

   The specification of any AVP SHOULD state that the AVP either shall
   or shall not be encrypted using Encr-Encap AVP.  The specification of
   an AVP MAY state that the AVP may (or may not) be encrypted using
   Encr-Encap AVP.  The specification SHOULD use a table in the format
   specified in Section 6.1.  If the specification of an AVP is silent
   about whether the AVP shall or shall not be encrypted using Encr-
   Encap AVP, this implies that the AVP MAY be encrypted using Encr-
   Encap AVP.

6.1.  Encryption Policy Specification

   This section defines a table format for the specification of whether
   an AVP shall or shall not be encrypted using Encr-Encap AVP.

   The table uses the following symbols:

   Y: The AVP SHALL be encrypted using Encr-Encap AVP.  If the AVP is
      encountered not encrypted using Encr-Encap AVP, it SHALL be
      considered invalid and the message containing the AVP SHALL be
      discarded.

   N: The AVP SHALL NOT be encrypted using Encr-Encap AVP.  If the AVP
      is encountered encrypted using Encr-Encap AVP, it SHALL be
      considered invalid and the message containing the AVP SHALL be
      discarded.

   X: The AVP MAY be encrypted using Encr-Encap AVP.  If the AVP is
      encountered either encrypted or not encrypted using Encr-Encap
      AVP, it SHALL be considered valid.

   The following table shows the encryption requirements for the
   existing AVPs defined in [RFC5191]:

            Integrity-Algorithm   | N |
            Key-Id                | N |
            Nonce                 | N |
            PRF-Algorithm         | N |
            Result-Code           | N |
            Session-Lifetime      | X |
            Termination-Cause     | X |
            ----------------------+---+


   The following table shows the encryption requirements for the AVPs
   defined in [RFC6345]:

            Attribute Name        |Enc|
            ----------------------+---+
            PaC-Information       | N |
            Relayed-Message       | N |
            ----------------------+---+


   The following table shows the encryption requirements for the AVPs
   defined in this document:

            Attribute Name        |Enc|
            ----------------------+---+
            Encr-Algorithm        | N |
            Encr-Encap            | N |
            ----------------------+---+


   The following table is an example of showing the encryption
   requirements for a newly-defined AVP, Example-AVP:

            Attribute Name        |Enc|
            ----------------------+---+
            Example-AVP           | Y |
            ----------------------+---+

7.  Security Considerations

   PANA_ENCR_KEY is a secret key shared between the PaC and the PAA.  It
   SHALL NOT be used for purposes other than the one specified in this
   document.  Compromise of this key would lead to compromise of the
   secret information protected by this key.


8.  IANA Considerations

   As described in Section 4 and Section 5, and following the new IANA
   allocation policy on PANA messages [RFC5872], two PANA AVP codes and
   one set of AVP values have been assigned.  An additional encryption
   policy for AVP codes has also been assigned.

8.1.  PANA AVP codes

   The following AVP codes have been assigned:

   o  A standard AVP code of TBD1 (suggested value 12) for Encr-Encap
      AVP.

   o  A standard AVP code of TBD2 (suggested value 13) for Encryption-
      Algorithm AVP.

8.2.  PANA Encryption-Algorithm AVP values

   The following AVP values representing the encryption algorithm
   identifier for the Encryption-Algorithm AVP code have been assigned:

   o  An AVP value of 1 for AES128_CTR.

   o  All other AVP values (0, 2-4294967295) are unassigned

   The registration procedures are IETF Review or IESG Approval in
   accordance with [RFC5872].

8.3.  PANA AVP codes encryption policy

   The additional encryption policy defined in Section 6.1 has been
   assigned to all existing AVP codes and those defined in this
   specification.
