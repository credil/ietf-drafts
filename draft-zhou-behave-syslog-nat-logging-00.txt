Internet-Draft       Syslog Requirements for NAT Log           July 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Traceback Solutions

   In the existing IPv6 transition technology, there are two ways of
   address and port mapping:static mapping and dynamic mapping.  Based
   on this, we summarize four traceback solutions:

   1.  After the address and port mapping information is created, NAT
       device (e.g.,Carrier Grade NAT) sends the syslog mapping
       information to the log server.  AAA system acquires the dynamic
       address mapping information from the syslog server when receiving
       traceback request.

   2.  NAT device reports the dynamic mapping information to AAA system
       via radius protocol.  AAA system will record the subscriber
       online information and source session list.  After traceback
       request is received, AAA system will return the trackback result
       with the subscriber online information and source session list
       information.

   3.  NAT device reports the dynamic mapping information to the log
       server through radius protocol.  AAA system acquires the mapping
       information from syslog server when receiving the traceback
       request.

   4.  AAA system and NAT device send the parameters through network
       configuration system and perform the same mapping algorithm to
       generate address and port.  In the traceback procedure, there is
       no need for AAA system and NAT device to transmit the mapping
       information.

   In solution 1 and 3, the traceback log server will be a newly created
   device.

1.2.  The Log Server Function

   The traceback log server receives, analyzes and stores the address/
   port address mapping information sent by NAT devices.  The logic
   illustration of the log server is shown in Figure 1.

   the NAT device via interface A, and provides the mapping information
   to the traceback system (or AAA) via interface B.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].

   :Logging information: In this document, this specifically means
   dynamic address/port mapping logging information.


3.  The Requirements of Log Server Function

   This section defines the basic requirements for the log server.

   o  It MUST support The Syslog Protocol [RFC5424].

   o  It MUST support Transport Layer Security (TLS) Transport Mapping
      forSyslog [RFC5425].

   o  It MUST support Transmission of Syslog Messages over UDP
      [RFC5426].  The log server must support sending the syslog log
      using standard UDP port 514, and support sending syslog log using
      any one self-configured port of the user.

   o  It is suggested to support Reliable Delivery for Syslog [RFC3195].

   o  It MUST support the Radius message format defined in [RFC2865] or
      [RFC2866].

   o  It MUST support acquiring user's dynamic address/port mapping
      information from NAT device.

   o  It MUST support the functions of log query, storage, filter,
      duplication removal, collection and statistic analysis.

   o  The storage information of the log server MUST include the
      following information, but not limited to:

      *  Application name

      *  Hostname

Internet-Draft       Syslog Requirements for NAT Log           July 2012


      *  Start time

      *  Original source IP

      *  Translated source IP

      *  Translated source start port

      *  Translated source stop port


4.  The Log Server Interface Requirements

   The log server MUST select one interface between syslog and radius to
   communicate with NAT device.  It MUST provide the query interface to
   the traceback system.

4.1.  Syslog Interface

   The syslog message includes two parts: the HEADER and the MSG.  The
   packet records the device operation using ASCII text, and the length
   of the packet should not exceed 1024 bytes.  The minimum length of
   the syslog message is not limited in this document.

4.1.1.  Definition of HEADER Part

   The HEADER part should include PRI,VERSION,TIMESTAMP,HOSTNAME,APP-
   NAME,PROCID and MSGID.  The PRI field indicates the log type.  The
   VERSION field denotes the version number of traceback log.  The
   HOSTNAME field identifies the device that originally sent the syslog
   message.  The TIMESTAMP field contains the timestamp of syslog
   generation.  The NAT device that generates the timestamp MUST use the
   NTP protocol, to synchronize with other devices in the network.  The
   APP-NAME field identifies the device name that originated the log
   message.  The PROCID field is used to provide the log group which the
   log belongs to.  One log group indicates a group of operations
   interrelated with each other, e.g., creating a translation table for
   one session and removing this table.  The MSGID field identifies the
   type of the log messgae.  The PRI,TIMESTAMP,HOSTNAME and MSGID are
   mandatory fields, and the APP-NAME, PROCID are optional fields.

4.1.1.1.  PRI

   The PRI field is composed of Facility and Severity values.  The
   algorithm of PRI is defined as: PRI = Facility*8+Severity.  The
   definition of syslog function code (Facility) is shown in Figure 2.

4.1.1.2.  VERSION

   The VERSION filed is set to 1.

4.1.1.3.  TIMESTAMP

   The format of TIMESTAMP is as below:

   < year> < mon> < day> < hh:mm:ss>

   year indicates the year the operation happens, which must be four
   digits, e.g., "2012". mon indicates month, and it could be one of the
   following values:Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct,
   Nov and Dec. day denotes the date, from 1 to 31.  Hh, mm and ss
   separately denote the hours, minutes and seconds.

4.1.1.4.  HOSTNAME

   The HOSTNAME field identifies the IPv4 address of the originating
   device, which is in the format of the dotted decimal notation, e.g.,
   10.1.1.1.

4.1.1.5.  APP-NAME

   The APP-NAME field identifies the name of the device that originated
   the syslog message.  It could be configured to the device by the
   manager, denoting the type of device, deployment site and model.

4.1.1.6.  PROCID

   The PROCID field is used to provide the number for a log group (the
   length of the number is suggested to be 16 bytes), which includes
   digits and characters.  It identifies the interrelated logs in one
   device.  The PROCID is allocated sequencely to the log group and
   could be used repeatedly for the next allocation.

4.1.1.7.  MSGID

   The MSGID field identifies the type of the message.  The format is
   defined as: < device type>: < message type>.  In the NAT444
   environment, the device type is NAT444.  In the DS-Lite environment,
   the device type is DSLITE.  The message type in MSGID includes:

   o  UserbasedA:this message is for user based log allocation.

   o  SessionbasedA:this message is for session based log allocation.

Internet-Draft       Syslog Requirements for NAT Log           July 2012


   o  UserbasedW:this message is for user based log withdrawal.

   o  SessionbasedW:this message is for session based log withdrawal.

   For example, the MSGID of user based log allocation for a DS-Lite
   device is:DSLITE:userbasedA.

4.1.2.  Definition of MSG Part

   The MSG part uses the ASCII characters.  It MUST include the
   following contents:

   o  L4 application identification:1 indicates ICMP; 6 indicates TCP
      and 17 indicates UDP.

   o  Original Source IP:Source IPv4 address before translation.

   o  Original Source IPv6:Source IPv6 address before translation.

   o  Translated Source IP:Source IPv4 address after translation.

   o  Original Port:Source port before translation.

   o  Translated First Source Port:The first source port after
      translation, or source port after translation in session based
      translation.

   o  Translated Last Source Port:The last source port after
      translation.

   The format of MSG part is:[<L4> < Original Source IP > < Original
   Source IPv6> < Translated Source IP > < Original Port > < Translated
   First Source Port > < Translated Last Source Port >]. for the
   parameters not existed in certain type of devices, the "-" is used.

   Two examples:

   1.  Session based UDP port mapping allocation in NAT444 case:[17
       10.0.0.1 - 192.168.0.1 - 10000 11000].

   2.  Session based TCP port mapping allocation in DS-Lite case:[6 -
       2001::1 192.168.1.1 80 80 -].

4.1.3.  Examples

   The following is an example of the syslog log message for user based
   UDP allocation in NAT444 case: < 134> 1 2012 Jun 7 12:34:08 10.1.1.1
   nat444-jiangsu - NAT444:userbasedA [17 10.0.0.1 - 192.168.0.1 - 10000

   11000].

4.2.  The Radius Interface Requirements

   The radius interface should use the Raidus message format defined in
   [RFC2865] or [RFC2866]. for the first traceback solution introduced
   above, there is no change to the radius interface.  The syslog
   message format is shown in section 4.1. for the solution 2, the
   traceback information is carried in the radius Accounting-Request
   packet.  The attributes are extended as below:

                      Figure 4: Attributes Extension

   For the radius server, USER-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute should be carried
   in the Accounting-Response message.

   For the BRAS side: Vendor-ID is owned by each vendor.  The sub-attr
   name, sub-attr number and type could be defined by the vendor itself.
   In the solution 2, the private attributes reported should be the
   translated address and ports(source and destination).

   In the traceback solution 3, NAT device reports the dynamic user

   address/port mapping information to the log server using Radius
   message.

   For the radius server, USER-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute should be carried
   in the Accounting-Response message.

   For the BRAS side: Vendor-ID is owned by each vendor.  The sub-attr
   name, sub-attr number and type could be defined by the vendor itself.

   BRAS reports the user traceback information to AAA server, in a
   delayed fixed time after sending the Accounting-Request message.  Or
   BARS sends the information to other ports of the AAA server for which
   to collect the traceback information.  In the solution 3, the private
   attributes reported should be the user account, mapping time, private
   address before translation, translated public address and
   ports(source and destination).


5.  The Performance Requirements of The Log Server

   There are some requirements for the log server:

   o  The packet processing capability of a single log server to receive
      syslog packet should not be less than 1,000 packets per second
      (CPU occupation rate should not exceed 50%).

   o  The response time of a single log server to process syslog packet
      should be less than or equal to 10 ms.

   o  The packet processing capability of a single log server to process
      log packet using Radius message should not be less than 1,000
      packets per second (CPU occupation rate should not exceed 50%)

   o  The response time of a single log server to process the log packet
      using Radius should be less than or equal to 10 ms.

   o  The log should be stored in the storage system of the log server
      for 6 months.


6.  The Reliability Requirements of The Log Server

   The requirements of reliability is listed as below:

   o  The system should meet or exceed 99.999% usability.

   o  The continuous work time without failure should be more than 100
      thousand hours.

   o  The failure recovery time should be less than 30 minutes.

   o  High reliability and stability.  Main processor, main cache, power
      and management interface should have hot standby capability.

   o  The server should have 1:1 backup.

   o  The blade system should support hot plug and pull.


7.  IANA Considerations

   No request to IANA.


8.  Security Considerations

   None.
