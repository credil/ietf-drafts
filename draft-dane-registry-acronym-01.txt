1.  Introduction

   During discussions on how to add DANE [RFC6698] technology to new
   protocols/services people repeatedly have got confused as what the
   numeric values stand for and even the order of the fields of a TLSA
   record.  This document updates the IANA registry definition for TLSA
   record to add a column with acronym for each specified field, in
   order to reduce confusion.  This document does not change the DANE
   protocol in any way.

   It is expected that DANE parser's in applications and DNS software
   MAY adopt parsing the acronyms for each field, installed base MAY NOT
   get updated.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  IANA considerations

   This document applies to "DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities
   (DANE) Parameters" located at "http://www.iana.org/assignments/dane-
   parameters/dane-parameters.xhtml".  Each one of the Sub-registries
   will add a column with an acronym for that field.

   [RFC6698] and this document are both to be the reference documents
   for the three sub-registries.

   As these acronyms are offered for human consumption, case does not
   matter, it is expected that software the parses TLSA records will
   handle any case use in the input> The expectation is that by using

   the acronyms in production systems fewer bad TLSA records will be
   published.

3.  Examples of usage

   TLSA records using/displaying the acronyms:
   _666._tcp.first.example.  TLSA PKIX-CA CERT SHA2-512 {blob}
   _666._tcp.second.example.  TLSA DANE-TA SPKI SHA2-256 {blob}

   Acronym use in a specification example: "Protocol FOO only allows
   TLSA records using PKIX-EE and DANE-EE, with selector SPKI and using
   SHA2-512."

   Sides example: "In the case of FOO for practical cases you can treat
   PKIX-CA == DANE-TE" (see talk at IETF-87 on DANE for email)

4.  Security considerations

   This document only changes registry fields and does not change the
   behavior of any protocol.  The hope is to reduce confusion and lead
   to better specification and operations.

5.  Acknowledgements

   Scott Schmit offered real good suggestions to decrease the
   possibility of confusion.
