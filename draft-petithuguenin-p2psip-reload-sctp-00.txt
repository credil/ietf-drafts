     SCTP Overlay link for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD)
               draft-petithuguenin-p2psip-reload-sctp-00

Abstract

   This document defines two new Overlay Link protocols to be used with
   REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), both using SCTP.  The
   Overlay Link protocol DTLS-SCTP-NO-ICE uses DTLS on top of native
   SCTP for overlays that do not require the use of ICE.  The Overlay
   Link protocol DTLS-SCTP-UDP uses DTLS on top of an UDP encapsulation
   of SCTP for overlays that require the use of ICE.

1.  Introduction

   RELOAD [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] defines 3 Overlay Link protocols, DTLS-
   UDP-SR, TLS-TCP-FH-NO-ICE and DTLS-UDP-SR-NO-ICE but none of them
   prevents Head of Line (HoL) blocking.  DTLS for SCTP [RFC6083], is a
   good candidate as Overlay Link protocol, but because most NATs cannot
   handle SCTP [RFC4960], it can only been used with overlays that are
   known to not have nodes behind a NAT.  For overlays that may have
   nodes behind a NAT, a UDP encapsulation of SCTP
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-udp-encaps] is used in place of the native SCTP,
   so it can traverses NAT Additionnaly using a UDP encapsulation does
   not require to define how using SCTP in ICE.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST" and "MUST NOT" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  DTLS-SCTP-NO-ICE Overlay Link Protocol

   This overlay link protocol consists of DTLS over SCTP, as specified
   in [RFC6083].  The RELOAD messages MUST be sent on a stream other
   than 0 (which is reserved for the DTLS ChangeCipherSpec, Alert and
   Handshake protocols), with unlimited reliability but without the
   ordered delivery feature.

   The Framing Header or the Simple Reliability protocols described in
   RELOAD MUST NOT be used.

4.  DTLS-SCTP-UDP Overlay Link Protocol

   This overlay link protocol consists of DTLS over an UDP encapsulation
   of SCTP, as specified in [RFC6083] and
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-udp-encaps].  The RELOAD messages MUST be sent
   on a stream other than 0 (which is reserved for the DTLS
   ChangeCipherSpec, Alert and Handshake protocols), with unlimited
   reliability but without the ordered delivery feature.

   The Framing Header or the Simple Reliability protocols described in
   RELOAD MUST NOT be used.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

6.  IANA Considerations

   If this document is accepted as a standard track document this
   section will request that IANA assign codes for the DTLS-SCTP-NO-ICE
   and DTLS-SCTP-UDP overlay protocols.  Until this is done,
   implementions should use code 5 (reserved for experimentations as
   EXP-LINK).  Using the same code is not an issue in this case as ICE
   and NO-ICE Overlays Protocols cannot be be simultaneously used in the
   same overlay.

   [[Do we need to also assign a PPID?]]
