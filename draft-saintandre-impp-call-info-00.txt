                   draft-saintandre-impp-call-info-00

Abstract

   This document defines and registers a value of "impp" ("instant

1.  Definition

   Developers of real-time communication endpoints that implement both
   the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] and the Extensible
   Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [RFC6120] sometimes wish to
   communicate the endpoint's SIP address over XMPP and communicate the
   endpoint's XMPP address over SIP.  The former feature is enabled by
   an XMPP extension protocol called Reachability Addresses [XEP-0152].
   As to the latter feature, discussion in the SIP community led to the
   conclusion of using the Call-Info header [RFC3261], with a predefined
   value of "impp" ("instant messaging and presence protocol") for the
   "purpose" header.  Therefore this document defines and registers the
   "impp" value for the "purpose" parameter.

   (Although the primary use case for the "impp" purpose is dual-stack
   SIP/XMPP endpoints [I-D.ivov-xmpp-cusax], a Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] for instant messaging and presence
   protocols other than XMPP could be included in the Call-Info header.)

2.  Security Considerations

   Advertising an endpoint's XMPP address over SIP could inform
   malicious entities about an alternative attack vector.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add a new predefined value "impp" for the
   "purpose" header field parameter of the Call-Info header field, by
   adding this RFC as a reference to the line for the header field
   "Call-Info" and parameter name "purpose":

   Header Field: Call-Info
   Parameter Name: purpose
   Predefined Values: yes
   Reference: [RFC3261][RFC5367][RFC XXXX]
