Abstract

   This document specifies the file Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   scheme that was originally specified in [RFC1738].  The purpose of
   this document is to keep the information about the scheme on
   standards track, since [RFC1738] has been made obsolete, and to
   promote interoperability by resolving disagreements between various
   implementations.

Note to Readers

   This draft should be discussed on its github project page [github].

Internet-Draft                 'file' URI                 September 2013


1.  Introduction

   The 'file' URI scheme has historically had little or no
   interoperability between platforms.  Further, implementers on a
   single platform have often disagreed on the syntax to use for a
   particular filesystem.  This document attempts to resolve those
   problems, and define a standard scheme which is interoperable between
   different extant and future implementations.  Additionally, it aims
   to ease implementation by conforming to a general syntax that allows
   existing URI parsing machinery to parse 'file' URIs.

   URIs were previously defined in [RFC1738], which was updated by
   [RFC3986].  Those documents also specify how to define schemes for
   URIs.

   The first definition for many URI schemes appeared in [RFC1738].
   Because that document has been made obsolete, this document copies
   the 'file' URI scheme from it to allow that material to remain on
   standards track.

1.1.  History

   This section is non-normative.

   The 'file' URI scheme was first defined in [RFC1630], which, being an
   informational RFC, does not specify an Internet standard.  The
   definition was standardised in [RFC1738], and the scheme was
   registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
   [IANA-URI-Schemes]; however that definition omitted certain language
   included by former that clarified aspects such as:

   o  the use of slashes to donate boundaries between directory levels
      of a hierarchical file system; and

   o  the requirement that client software convert the 'file' URI into a
      file name in the local file name conventions.

   The Internet draft [I-D.draft-hoffman-file-uri] was written in an
   effort to keep the 'file' URI scheme on standards track when
   [RFC1738] was made obsolete, but that draft expired in 2005.  It
   enumerated concerns arising from the various, often conflicting
   implementations of the scheme.  It serves as the basis of this
   document.

Internet-Draft                 'file' URI                 September 2013


   The 'file' URI scheme defined in [RFC1738] is referenced three times
   in the current URI Generic Syntax standard [RFC3986], despite the
   former's obsoletion:

   1.  RFC 3986, Section 1.1 uses "file:///etc/hosts" as an example for
       identifying a resource in relation to the end-user's local
       context.

   2.  RFC 3968, Section 1.2.3 mentions the "file" scheme regarding
       relative references.

   3.  RFC 3968, Section 3.2.2 says that '...the "file" URI scheme is
       defined so that no authority, an empty host, and "localhost" all
       mean the end-user's machine...'.

   Finally the WHATWG defines a living URL standard [WHATWG-URL], which
   includes algorithms for interpreting file URIs (as URLs).

1.2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Scheme Definition

   The 'file' URI scheme is used to identify and retrieve 'files'
   accessible on a particular host computer, where a "file" is a named
   resource which can be accessed through the computer's filesystem
   interface.  These file names are interpreted from the perspective of
   the user of a reference, rather than in relation to a globally-
   defined naming authority, so care ought to be taken when distributing
   'file' URIs to ensure that such references are actually intended to
   be interpreted in relation to the end user's filesystem interface.

   This scheme, unlike most other URI schemes, does not identify a
   resource that is universally accessible over the Internet.

   The mechanism for retrieving a representation of a dereferenced
   'file' URI is through the computer's filesystem interface; for
   example using the POSIX "open", "read" and "close" functions [POSIX].

   Also note that 'file' and 'ftp' URIs are not the same, even when the
   target of the 'ftp' URI is the local host.

Internet-Draft                 'file' URI                 September 2013


2.1.  Components

   The 'file' URI scheme conforms with the generic structure defined in
   [RFC3986], and can be described in terms of its components:

   Scheme
      The literal value "file"

   Authority
      The authority component of a 'file' URI describes the machine or
      system on which the file is accessible.  If the authority refers
      to a remote system, from the point of view of the user of the URI,
      the implication is that the file system cannot be accessed, or
      perhaps that some other mechanism must be used to access the file.
      It does not imply that the file ought to be accessible over a
      network connection.  No retrieval mechanism for files stored on a
      a remote machine is defined by this specification.

      The authority component is optional in a 'file' URI.

      If present it is either: one of the special values "localhost" or
      the empty string (""); or the host name of the system on which the
      file is accessible.

      If the authority component is omitted, or has either of the
      special values "localhost" or the empty string (""), it is
      interpreted as "the machine from which the URI is being
      interpreted".

   Path
      The path component of a 'file' URI describes the hierarchical
      directory path to the file, using the slash ("/") character to
      separate directories.  Implementations SHOULD translate between
      the slash-separated URI syntax and the local system's conventions
      for specifying file paths, where they differ.  (See: Section 3.1)

      Note that the leading slash, if any, is included in the path
      value.

      Some systems allow 'file' URIs to refer to directories.  In this
      case, the path usually (but not always) includes a terminating
      slash character, such as in:

         file:///usr/local/bin/

      The presence of a terminating slash character always indicates
      that the 'file' URI refers to a directory, but the absence of a
      slash does not necessarily indicate that it refers to a filesystem

      object other than a directory.  Implementations ought to use other
      mechanisms to detect directories, if and when such detection is
      required.

   Query
      The query component of a 'file' URI contains non-hierarchical data
      that, along with data in the path component, serves to identify a
      file.  For example, in a versioning file system, the query
      component might be used to refer to a specific version of a file.

      Few implementations are known to use or support query components
      in 'file' URIs.

   Fragment
      The semantics of a fragment component are undefined by this
      specification.  A protocol that employs 'file' URIs MAY define its
      own semantics for fragment components in the context of that
      protocol.

   Previous definitions of the 'file' URI scheme required two slashes
   between the scheme and path, so implementations that wish to remain
   interoperable with older implementations ought to include an
   authority component in any 'file' URIs they generate.

2.2.  Syntax

   The 'file' URI syntax is defined here in Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) [RFC5234], including the core ABNF syntax rule 'ALPHA' defined
   by that specification, and borrowing the 'host', 'path-absolute' and
   'segment' rules from [RFC3986] (as updated by [RFC6874]).

      fileURI       = "file" ":" ( auth-file / local-file )

      auth-file     = "//" ( host-file / nohost-file )

      host-file     = hostpart path-absolute
                                     ;   file://<host>/<path>
                                     ;   file://localhost/<path>

      nohost-file   = path-abs       ; begins with "/"
                    / path-abs-win   ; begins with drive-letter
                                     ;   file:///<path>
                                     ;   file:////<bad-UNC-path>
                                     ;   file://c:/<path> *

      local-file    = path-absolute  ;   file:/<path>
                    / path-abs-win   ;   file:c:/<path>

Internet-Draft                 'file' URI                 September 2013


      hostpart      = "localhost" / host

      path-abs      = 1*( "/" segment )

      path-abs-win  = drive-letter path-absolute
      drive-letter  = ALPHA [ drive-marker ]
      drive-marker  = ":" / "|"

   * The 'no-host-file' rule allows for dubious URIs that encode a
   Windows drive letter as the authority component.  See Section 3.3 of
   RFC XXXX.  [Note to RFC Editor: please replace XXXX with the number
   issued to this document.]

   Note the difference between the 'path-abs' and 'path-absolute' rules:
   only the former allows a zero-length first segment followed by a
   slash, e.g. "//foo/bar"

   Systems exhibit different levels of case-sensitivity.
   Implementations SHOULD maintain the case of file and directory names
   when translating 'file' URIs to and from the local system's
   representation of file paths, and any systems or devices that
   transport 'file' URIs SHOULD NOT alter the case of 'file' URIs they
   transport.

3.  Implementation Notes

3.1.  Hierarchical Structure

   Most implementations of the 'file' URI scheme do a reasonable job of
   mapping the hierarchical part of a directory structure into the slash
   ("/") delimited hierarchy of the URI syntax, independent of the
   native platform's delimiter.

   For example, on Microsoft Windows platforms, it is typical that the
   file system presents backslash ("\") as the file delimeter for file
   names, yet the URI's forward slash ("/") can be used in 'file' URIs
   interpreted on those platforms.  Similarly, on (some) Macintosh OS
   versions, at least in some contexts, the colon (":") is used as the
   delimiter in the native presentation of file path names.  Unix
   systems natively use the same forward slash ("/") delimiter for
   hierarchy, so there is a closer mapping between 'file' URI paths and
   native path names.

   In accordance with Section 3.3 of [RFC3986], the path segments "."
   and "..", also known as dot-segments, are only interpreted within
   the URI path hierarchy and are removed as part of the resolution
   process ([RFC3986], Section 5.2 [5]).  Implementations operating on
   or interacting with systems that allow dot-segments in their native

Internet-Draft                 'file' URI                 September 2013


   path representation may be required to escape those segments using
   some other means when translating to and from 'file' URIs.

3.2.  Absolute and relative file paths

   The conventions for specifying absolute file paths differ from system
   to system.  For example, in a UNIX-based system an absolute file path
   begins with a slash ("/") character, denoting the root of the
   filesystem, whereas on a Microsoft DOS- or Windows-based system an
   absolute file path begins with a drive letter (e.g. "c:\").

   As relative references are resolved into their respective (absolute)
   target URIs according to Section 5 [6] of [RFC3986], this document
   does not describe that resolution.  However, a fully resolved URI may
   contain a non-absolute path.  For example, using a generic parser,
   the URI:

      file:alpha/bravo/charlie

   would be parsed and interpreted as: file 'charlie', in directory
   'bravo', in directory 'alpha', on the machine on which the URI is
   being interpreted (i.e. localhost); however there is no indication of
   the location of the directory 'alpha' on that machine.  By convention
   an absolute file path would begin with a slash ("/") character on a
   Unix-based system, or a drive letter (e.g. "c:\") on a Microsoft
   Windows system, etc.

   Resolution of relative file paths is undefined by this specification.
   A protocol that employs 'file' URIs MAY define its own rules for
   resolution of relative file paths in the context of that protocol.

3.3.  Drive Letters

   Historically drive letters have been mapped into the top of a 'file'
   URI in various ways.  On systems running some versions of Microsoft
   Windows the drive letter may be specified with a colon (":")
   character, however sometimes the colon is replaced with a pipe ("|")
   character, and in some implementations the colon is omitted entirely.
   The three representations MAY be considered equivalent, and any
   implementation which could interact with a Microsoft Windows
   environment SHOULD interpret a single letter, optionally followed by
   a colon or pipe character, in the first segment of the path as a
   drive letter (see the "drive-letter" rule in Section 2.2).  For
   example, the following URIs:

      file:///c:/TMP/test.txt
      file:///c|/TMP/test.txt
      file:///c/TMP/test.txt

Internet-Draft                 'file' URI                 September 2013


   when interpreted on the same machine, would refer to the same file:

      c:\TMP\test.txt

   Implementations SHOULD use a colon (":") character to specify drive
   letters when generating URIs for Windows- and DOS-based systems.

   Note that the generic URI syntax in [RFC3986] dictates that "if a URI
   contains an authority component [even if it's a blank authority],
   then the path component must ... begin with a slash ("/") character."
   However some systems running some versions of Microsoft Windows are
   known to omit the slash before the drive letter, effectively
   replacing the URI's authority component with the drive specification;
   for example, "file://c:/TMP/test.txt".  In line with Postel's
   robustness principle ("an implementation must be conservative in its
   sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior" [RFC791])
   implementations that are likely to encounter such a URI MAY interpret
   it as a drive letter, but SHOULD NOT generate such URIs.

3.4.  UNC File Paths

   The Microsoft Windows Universal Naming Convention (UNC) [MS-DTYP]
   defines a convention for specifying the location of resources such as
   shared files or devices, for example Windows shares accessed via the
   SMB/CIFS protocol [MS-SMB2].  The general structure of a UNC file
   path, given in Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234], is:

      UNC        = "\\" hostname "\" sharename *( "\" objectname )
      hostname   = <NetBIOS name, FQDN, or IP address of a server>
      sharename  = <name of a share or resource to be accessed>
      objectname = <the name of an object>

   Note that this syntax description is non-normative.

   The canonical representation of a UNC file path as a 'file' URI
   copies the UNC 'hostname' into the URI 'host' field, and the UNC
   'sharename' and 'objectname's, concatenated with forward slash ("/")
   characters, into the 'path'.  For example, the following UNC path:

      \\server.example.com\Share\path\to\file.doc

   is represented as a 'file' URI canonically as:

      file://server.example.com/Share/path/to/file.doc
             \________________/\_____________________/
                  hostname      sharename+objectnames

Internet-Draft                 'file' URI                 September 2013


   Historically some implementations have translated UNC file paths
   entirely into the 'path' segment of a 'file' URI, including both
   leading slashes, and the Firefox web browser even prefixes the UNC
   file path with another slash.  For example, the UNC path given above
   might be translated as:

      file:////server.example.com/Share/path/to/file.doc
             \_________________________________________/
                        translated UNC path

   or even:

      file://///server.example.com/Share/path/to/file.doc
              \_________________________________________/
                        translated UNC path

   An implementation receiving such a URI SHOULD convert it to the
   canonical representation before processing it.

   The 'file' URI scheme is unusual in that it does not specify an
   Internet protocol or access method for shared files; as such, its
   utility in network protocols between hosts is limited.  Examples of
   file server protocols that do define such access methods include SMB/
   CIFS [MS-SMB2], NFS [RFC3530], and NCP [NOVELL].

3.5.  Namespaces

   The Microsoft Windows API defines Win32 Namespaces [Win32-Namespaces]
   for interacting with files and devices using Windows API functions.
   These namespaced paths are prefixed by "\\?\" for Win32 File
   Namespaces and "\\.\" for Win32 Device Namespaces.  There is also a
   special case for UNC file paths [MS-DTYP] in Win32 File Namespaces,
   referred to as "Long UNC", using the prefix "\\?\UNC\".

   This specification does not define a mechanism for translating
   namespaced file paths into 'file' URIs.

4.  Encoding and Character Set Considerations

   As specified in [RFC3986], the 'file' URI scheme allows any character
   from the Universal Character Set (UCS) [ISO10646] encoded as UTF-8
   [RFC3629] and then percent-encoded in valid ASCII [RFC20].

   If the local file system uses a known non-Unicode character encoding,
   the file path SHOULD be converted to a sequence of Unicode characters
   normalized according to Normalization Form C (NFC, [UTR15]).

   Before applying any percent-encoding, an application MUST ensure the
   following about the string that is used as input to the URI-
   construction process:

   o  The host, if any, consists only of Unicode code points that
      conform to the rules specified in [RFC5892].

   o  Internationalized domain name (IDN) labels are encoded as A-labels
      [RFC5890].

5.  Security Considerations

   There are many security considerations for URI schemes discussed in
   [RFC3986].

   File access and the granting of privileges for specific operations
   are complex topics, and the use of 'file' URIs can complicate the
   security model in effect for file privileges.  Under no circumstance
   should software using 'file' URIs grant greater access than would be
   available for other file access methods.

6.  IANA Considerations

   In accordance with the guidelines and registration procedures for new
   URI schemes [RFC4395], this section provides the information needed
   to update the registration of the 'file' URI scheme.

6.1.  URI Scheme Name

   file

6.2.  Status

   permanent

6.3.  URI Scheme Syntax

   See Section 2.2 of RFC XXXX.  [Note to RFC Editor: please replace
   XXXX with the number issued to this document.]

6.4.  URI Scheme Semantics

   See Section 2 of RFC XXXX.  [Note to RFC Editor: please replace XXXX
   with the number issued to this document.]

6.5.  Encoding Considerations

   See Section 4 of RFC XXXX.  [Note to RFC Editor: please replace XXXX
   with the number issued to this document.]

6.6.  Applications/Protocols That Use This URI Scheme Name

   Web browsers:

   o  Firefox

         Note: Firefox has a unique interpretation of RFC 1738 (See:
         Bugzilla#107540 [1]), which affects UNC paths.

   o  Chromium

   o  Internet Explorer

   o  Opera

   Other applications/protocols:

   o  Windows API [2, 3]

   o  Perl LWP

6.7.  Interoperability Considerations

   Due to the convoluted history of the 'file' URI scheme there a many,
   varied implementations in existence.  Many have converged over time,
   forming a few kernels of closely-related functionality, and RFC XXXX
   attempts to accommodate such common functionality.  [Note to RFC
   Editor: please replace XXXX with the number issued to this document.]
   However there will always be exceptions, and this fact is recognised.

6.8.  Security Considerations

   See Section 4 of RFC XXXX [Note to RFC Editor: please replace XXXX
   with the number issued to this document.]
