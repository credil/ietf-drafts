Abstract

   in networks including APS links or links with an inherent protection
   capability.  It also identifies gaps in the current GMPLS standards
   which may prevent these policy options from being implemented.

1.  Introduction

   As described in [RFC4202], GMPLS networks frequently contain links
   which have an inherent protection capability, for example SONET APS
   links or abstract links which represent a bundle of lower layer LSPs.
   An operator may wish to configure different policies which, in the
   event of a failure that causes a change in the available protection
   capability of a link, affect both path computation and provisioned
   services.  This draft describes some of these policy behaviors, and
   identifies where these behaviours cannot be implemented using
   existing GMPLS standards.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Protected Links

   A link can be said to have an inherent protection capability if, in
   the event of a data plane failure affecting some part of the link,
   the link can continue to carry data.  We call links which have an
   inherent protection capability "Protected Links".  Figure 1 below
   shows an example of a Protected Link.

                     Lower Layer LSPs providing protection


         Figure 1: Diagram showing an example of a protected link

   In this example, a bundle of LSPs transport data between the two
   network elements, as described in [RFC4201].  These LSPs are
   advertised as a single link into the client layer IGP.  A protection
   scheme (such as 1+1, as described in [RFC4427]) can be configured for
   the link bundle to ensure that if one link in the bundle fails,
   traffic will be unaffected because other links in the bundle carry
   the data.  Hence the link in the client layer has its own protection
   capabilities, which it can advertise as per [RFC4202].  However,
   failures of lower-layer LSPs can mean that, whilst the overall link
   bundle is still able to carry traffic, the protection capabilities
   that are still configured, are no longer present.  Such links are
   referred to as "Protection Impaired".

3.  Operator requirements

   Operators have the following requirements which SHOULD be met in
   networks containing Protection Impaired links.

      R1.  It SHOULD be possible to include or exclude a Protection
      Impaired link from a path computed for an LSP, depending on the
      type of service that will use the LSP.  For example, an operator's
      policy may allow LSPs corresponding to high priority unprotected
      services to be provisioned over the Protection-Impaired Link, but
      prevent lower priority LSPs from using it (because once the
      failure has been repaired, bandwidth on a high-value protected
      link would be used for low-priority LSPs).

      R2.  Depending on the service-level of a given LSP, it SHOULD be
      possible to configure a policy to reroute an existing LSP when a
      link it traverses becomes Protection Impaired (for example, if
      there are other links available which still have currently active
      protection capabilities).  If the fault is repaired, then it
      SHOULD be possible to automatically revert the LSP to the original
      path.

3.1.  Operational considerations

   It is often advantageous to centralize policy configuration on as few
   network elements as possible.  This makes network-wide policy changes
   easier to implement for operators.  For example, in networks where
   Path Computation is performed by only a subset of the network
   elements (e.g. PCEs), it is preferable that the policy configuration
   relating to Path Computation is applied solely to those network
   elements.

4.  Gap Analysis

   An analysis of the current GMPLS protocols against the above
   requirements is as follows.

   R1.  As per [RFC4202], the current link protection type can be
   advertised by the OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE protocols so elements performing
   Path Computation can understand the currently available protection
   type.  Per-Network Element level policy can determine the how the
   protection type is set when the link is advertised.  However, there
   is no way currently to advertise both the configured link protection
   type and the current link protection type.  Therefore, it is not
   possible to implement the Path Computation behavior described above
   if a different policy is required for different LSPs.

   R2.  A node which detects a failure MAY use the procedures defined in
   [RFC5712] to inform the head-end LSR.  The head-end LSR MAY then
   elect to use this as a trigger to perform Path Computation to
   determine whether an alternative route exists and possibly re-route
   the LSP.  However, there is no similar mechanism to inform the head-
   end LSR when a failure has been cleared.
