Abstract

   For some location-based applications, such as emergency calling or
   roadside assistance, the trustworthiness of location information is
   critically important.

   This document describes how to convey location in a manner that is
   inherently secure and reliable.  It also provides guidelines for
   assessing the trustworthiness of location information.

INTERNET-DRAFT            Trustworthy Location             13 March 2013


1.  Introduction

   Several public and commercial services depend upon location
   information in their operations.  This includes emergency services
   (such as fire, ambulance and police) as well as commercial services
   such as food delivery and roadside assistance.

   Services that depend on location commonly experience security issues
   today.  While prank calls have been a problem for emergency services
   dating back to the time of street corner call boxes, with the move to
   IP-based emergency services, the ability to launch automated attacks
   has increased.  As the European Emergency Number Association (EENA)
   has noted [EENA]: "False emergency calls divert emergency services
   away from people who may be in life-threatening situations and who
   need urgent help.  This can mean the difference between life and
   death for someone in trouble."

   EENA [EENA] has attempted to define terminology and describe best
   current practices for dealing with false emergency calls, which in
   certain European countries can constitute as much as 70% of all
   emergency calls.  Reducing the number of prank calls represents a
   challenge, since emergency services authorities in most countries are
   required to answer every call (whenever possible).  Where the caller
   cannot be identified, the ability to prosecute is limited.

   Since prank emergency calls can endanger bystanders or emergency
   services personnel, or divert resources away from legitimate
   emergencies, they can be life threatening.  A particularly dangerous
   form of prank call is "swatting" - an prank emergency call that draws
   a response from law enforcement (e.g. a fake hostage situation that
   results in dispatching of a "Special Weapons And Tactics" (SWAT)
   team).  In 2008 the FBI issued a warning [Swatting] about an increase
   in the frequency and sophistication of these attacks.

   Many documented cases of "swatting" involve not only the faking of an
   emergency, but also the absence of accurate caller identification and
   the delivery of misleading location data.  Today these attacks are
   often carried out by providing false caller identification, since for
   circuit-switched calls from landlines, location provided to the PSAP
   is determined from a lookup using the calling telephone number.  With
   IP-based emergency services, in addition to the potential for false
   caller identification, it is also possible to attach misleading
   location information to the emergency call.

   Ideally, a call taker at a PSAP should be put in the position to
   assess, in real-time, the level of trust that can be placed on the
   information provided within a call.  This includes automated location
   conveyed along with the call and location information communicated by



Tschofenig, et. al            Informational                     [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Trustworthy Location             13 March 2013


   the caller, as well as identity information about the caller.  Where
   real-time assessment is not possible, it is important to be able to
   determine the source of the call in a post-mortem, so as to be able
   to enforce accountability.

   This document defines terminology (including the meaning of
   "trustworthy location") in Section 1.1, investigates security threats
   in Section 2, outlines potential solutions in Section 3, covers trust
   assessment in Section 4 and discusses security considerations in
   Section 5.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The definition for "Target" is taken from "Geopriv Requirements"
   [RFC3693].

   The term "location determination method" refers to the mechanism used
   to determine the location of a Target.  This may be something
   employed by a location information server (LIS), or by the Target
   itself.  It specifically does not refer to the location configuration
   protocol (LCP) used to deliver location information either to the
   Target or the Recipient.  This term is re-used from "GEOPRIV PIDF-LO
   Usage Clarification, Considerations, and Recommendations" [RFC5491].

   The term "source" is used to refer to the LIS, node, or device from
   which a Recipient (Target or Third-Party) obtains location
   information.

   Additionally, the terms Location-by-Value (LbyV), Location-by-
   Reference (LbyR), Location Configuration Protocol, Location
   Dereference Protocol, and Location URI are re-used from "Requirements
   for a Location-by-Reference Mechanism" [RFC5808].

   "Trustworthy Location" is defined as location information that can be
   attributed to a trusted source, has been protected against
   modification in transmit, and has been assessed as trustworthy.

   "Location Trust Assessment" refers to the process by which the
   reliability of location information can be assessed.  This topic is
   discussed in Section 4.

2.  Threats

   While previous IETF documents have analyzed aspects of the security
   of emergency services or threats to geographic location privacy,
   those documents do not cover the threats arising from unreliable
   location information.

   A threat analysis of the emergency services system is provided in
   "Security Threats and Requirements for Emergency Call Marking and
   Mapping" [RFC5069]. RFC 5069 describes attacks on the emergency
   services system, such as attempting to deny system services to all
   users in a given area, to gain fraudulent use of services and to
   divert emergency calls to non-emergency sites.  [RFC5069] also
   describes attacks against individuals, including attempts to prevent
   an individual from receiving aid, or to gain information about an
   emergency.  "Threat Analysis of the Geopriv Protocol" [RFC3694]
   describes threats against geographic location privacy, including
   protocol threats, threats resulting from the storage of geographic
   location data, and threats posed by the abuse of information.

   This document focuses on threats from attackers providing false
   location information within emergency calls.  Since we do not focus
   on attackers gaining control of infrastructure elements (e.g.,
   location servers, call route servers) or the emergency services IP
   network, the threats are derived from the introduction of
   untrustworthy location information by end hosts.  In addition to
   threats arising from the intentional forging of location information,
   end hosts may be induced to provide untrustworthy location
   information.  For example, end hosts may obtain location from
   civilian GPS, which is vulnerable to spoofing [GPSCounter] or from
   third party Location Service Providers (LSPs) which may be vulnerable
   to attack or may not warrant the use of their services for emergency
   purposes.

   To provide a structured analysis we distinguish between three
   adversary models:

   External adversary model:  The end host, e.g., an emergency caller
      whose location is going to be communicated, is honest and the
      adversary may be located between the end host and the location
      server or between the end host and the PSAP.  None of the
      emergency service infrastructure elements act maliciously.

   Malicious infrastructure adversary model:  The emergency call routing
      elements, such as the LIS, the LoST infrastructure, used for
      mapping locations to PSAP address, or call routing elements, may
      act maliciously.

INTERNET-DRAFT            Trustworthy Location             13 March 2013


   Malicious end host adversary model:  The end host itself acts
      maliciously, whether the owner is aware of this or whether it is
      acting as a bot.

   In this document, we focus only on the malicious end host adversary
   model.

2.1.  Location Spoofing

   An adversary can provide false location information in an emergency
   call in order to misdirect emergency resources.  For calls
   originating within the PSTN, this attack can be carried out via
   caller-id spoofing.  Where location is attached to the emergency call
   by an end host,  several avenues are available to provide false
   location information:

      1.  The end host could fabricate a PIDF-LO and convey it within an
      emergency call;

      2.  The VSP (and indirectly a LIS) could be fooled into using the
      wrong identity (such as an IP address) for location lookup,
      thereby providing the end host with misleading location
      information;

      3.  Inaccurate or out-of-date information (such spoofed GPS
      signals, a stale wiremap or an inaccurate access point location
      database) could be utilized by the LIS or the end host in its
      location determination, thereby leading to an inaccurate
      determination of location.

   By analysis of the SIP headers, it may be possible to flag situations
   where the conveyed location is suspect (e.g. potentially wrong city,
   state, country or continent).  However, in other situations only
   entities close to the caller may be able to verify the correctness of
   location information.

   The following list presents threats specific to location information
   handling:

   Place shifting:  Trudy, the adversary, pretends to be at an arbitrary
      location.  In some cases, place shifting can be limited in range,
      e.g., to the coverage area of a particular cell tower.

   Time shifting:  Trudy pretends to be at a location she was a while
      ago.

   Location theft:  Trudy observes Alice's location and replays it as
      her own.

INTERNET-DRAFT            Trustworthy Location             13 March 2013


   Location swapping:  Trudy and Malory, located in different locations,
      can collude and swap location information and pretend to be in
      each other's location.

2.2.  Identity Spoofing

   With calls originating on an IP network, at least two forms of
   identity are relevant, with the distinction created by the split
   between the AIP and the VSP:

   (a) network access identity such as might be determined via
   authentication (e.g., using the Extensible Authentication Protocol
   (EAP) [RFC3748]);

   (b) caller identity, such as might be determined from authentication
   of the emergency caller at the VoIP application layer.

   If the adversary did not authenticate itself to the VSP, then
   accountability may depend on verification of the network access
   identity.  However, this also may not have been authenticated, such
   as in the case where an open IEEE 802.11 Access Point is used to
   initiate a nuisance emergency call.  Although endpoint information
   such as the IP or MAC address may have been logged, tying this back
   to the device owner may be challenging.

   Unlike the existing telephone system, VoIP emergency calls could
   require strong identity, which need not necessarily be coupled to a
   business relationship with the AIP, ISP or VSP.  However, due to the
   time-critical nature of emergency calls, multi-layer authentication
   is undesirable, so that in most cases, only the device placing the
   call will be able to be identified, making the system vulnerable to
   bot-net attacks. Furthermore, deploying additional credentials for
   emergency service purposes (such as certificates) increases costs,
   introduces a significant administrative overhead and is only useful
   if widely deployed.

3.  Solutions

   This section presents three mechanisms which can be used to convey
   location: signed location by value (Section 3.1), location by
   reference (Section 3.2) and proxy added location (Section 3.3).

   In order for to provide authentication and integrity protection for
   the SIP messages conveying location, several security approaches are
   available.  While it is possible for proxies to use security
   mechanisms such as SIP Identity [RFC4474] to ensure that
   modifications to the location in transit can be detected by the
   location recipient (e.g., the PSAP), compatibility with Session



Tschofenig, et. al            Informational                     [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Trustworthy Location             13 March 2013


   Border Controllers (SBCs) that modify integrity-protected headers has
   proven to be an issue in practice.  As a result, the use of SIP over
   TLS is at present a more likely mechanism to provide per-message
   authentication and integrity protection.

3.1.  Signed Location by Value

   With location signing, a location server signs the location
   information before it is sent to the end host, (the entity subject to
   the location determination process).

   The signed location information is then verified by the location
   recipient and not by the target.  Figure 1 shows the communication
   model with the target requesting signed location in step (a), the
   location server returns it in step (b) and it is then conveyed to the
   location recipient in step (c) who verifies it.  For SIP, the
   procedures described in "Location Conveyance for the Session
   Initiation Protocol" [RFC6442] are applicable for location
   conveyance.

                        Figure 1: Location Signing

   In order to limit replay attacks, additional information, such as
   timestamps or expiration times, has to be included together with the
   signed location.  If the location is retrieved from a location
   server, even a stationary end host has to periodically obtain a fresh
   signed location, or incur the additional delay of querying during the
   emergency call.

   While bot-nets are unlikely to be deterred by location signing,



Tschofenig, et. al            Informational                     [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Trustworthy Location             13 March 2013


   accurate location information would limit the subset of the bot-net
   that could be used for an attack, as only hosts within the PSAP
   serving area would be useful in placing emergency calls.

   To prevent location-swapping attacks it is necessary to include some
   some target-specific identity information.  The required information
   depends on whether the goal is real-time verification by the location
   recipient or post-mortem analysis (where the goal is determination of
   the legal entity responsible for the attack).  As argued in Section
   4, real-time verification is not always possible.

   Location signing is unlikely to deter attacks launched by bot-nets,
   since the work required to verify the location signature is
   considerable.  Location signing is also difficult when the host
   obtains location via mechanisms such as GPS, unless trusted computing
   approaches, with tamper-proof GPS modules, can be applied.
   Otherwise, an end host can pretend to have a GPS device, and the
   recipient will need to rely on its ability to assess the level of
   trust that should be placed in the end host location claim.

   A straw-man proposal for location signing is provided in [I-
   D.thomson-geopriv-location-dependability], and [NENA-i2] Section 3.7
   includes operational recommendations relating to location signing:

      Location determination is out of scope for NENA, but we can offer
      guidance on what should be considered when designing mechanisms to
      report location:

      1.  The location object should be digitally signed.

      2.  The certificate for the signer (LIS operator) should be
          rooted in VESA.  For this purpose, VPC and ERDB operators
          should issue certs to LIS operators.

      3.  The signature should include a timestamp.

      4.  Where possible, the Location Object should be refreshed
          periodically, with the signature (and thus the timestamp)
          being refreshed as a consequence.

      5.  Anti-spoofing mechanisms should be applied to the Location
          Reporting method.

      [Note:  The term Valid Emergency Services Authority (VESA) refers
      to the root certificate authority.]

   As noted above, signing of location objects implies the development
   of a trust hierarchy that would enable a certificate chain provided



Tschofenig, et. al            Informational                     [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Trustworthy Location             13 March 2013


   by the LIS operator to be verified by the PSAP.  Rooting the trust
   hierarchy in VESA can be accomplished either by having the VESA
   directly sign the LIS certificates, or by the creation of
   intermediate CAs certified by the VESA, which will then issue
   certificates to the LIS.  In terms of the workload imposed on the
   VESA, the latter approach is highly preferable.  However, this raises
   the question of who would operate the intermediate CAs and what the
   expectations would be.

   In particular, the question arises as to the requirements for LIS
   certificate issuance, and whether they are significantly different
   from say, requirements for issuance of an SSL/TLS web certificate.

3.2.  Location by Reference

   Location-by-reference was developed so that end hosts can avoid
   having to periodically query the location server for up- to-date
   location information in a mobile environment.  Additionally, if
   operators do not want to disclose location information to the end
   host without charging them, location-by-reference provides a
   reasonable alternative.  As noted in "A Location Dereference Protocol
   Using HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)" [RFC6753], a location
   reference can be obtained via HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)
   [RFC5985] or the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) location
   URI option [DHCP-URI-OPT].

   Figure 2 shows the communication model with the target requesting a
   location reference in step (a), the location server returns the
   reference in step (b), and it is then conveyed to the location
   recipient in step (c).  The location recipient needs to resolve the
   reference with a request in step (d).  Finally, location information
   is returned to the Location Recipient afterwards.  For location

                      Figure 2: Location by Reference

   Where location by reference is provided, the recipient needs to
   deference the LbyR in order to obtain location.  The details for the
   dereferencing operations vary with the type of reference, such as a
   HTTP, HTTPS, SIP, SIPS URI or a SIP presence URI.

   For location-by-reference, the location server needs to maintain one
   or several URIs for each target, timing out these URIs after a
   certain amount of time.  References need to expire to prevent the
   recipient of such a URL from being able to permanently track a host
   and to offer garbage collection functionality for the location
   server.

   Off-path adversaries must be prevented from obtaining the target's
   location.  The reference contains a randomized component that
   prevents third parties from guessing it.  When the location recipient
   fetches up-to-date location information from the location server, it
   can also be assured that the location information is fresh and not
   replayed.  However, this does not address location swapping.

   With respect to the security of the de-reference operation, [RFC6753]
   Section 6 states:

      TLS MUST be used for dereferencing location URIs unless
      confidentiality and integrity are provided by some other
      mechanism, as discussed in Section 3.  Location Recipients MUST
      authenticate the host identity using the domain name included in
      the location URI, using the procedure described in Section 3.1 of
      [RFC2818].  Local policy determines what a Location Recipient does

      if authentication fails or cannot be attempted.

      The authorization by possession model (Section 4.1) further relies
      on TLS when transmitting the location URI to protect the secrecy
      of the URI.  Possession of such a URI implies the same privacy
      considerations as possession of the PIDF-LO document that the URI
      references.

      Location URIs MUST only be disclosed to authorized Location
      Recipients.  The GEOPRIV architecture [RFC6280] designates the
      Rule Maker to authorize disclosure of the URI.

      Protection of the location URI is necessary, since the policy
      attached to such a location URI permits anyone who has the URI to
      view the associated location information.  This aspect of security
      is covered in more detail in the specification of location
      conveyance protocols, such as [RFC6442].

   For authorizing access to location-by-reference, two authorization
   models were developed: "Authorization by Possession" and
   "Authorization via Access Control Lists".  With respect to
   "Authorization by Possession" [RFC6753] Section 4.1 notes:

      In this model, possession -- or knowledge -- of the location URI
      is used to control access to location information.  A location URI
      might be constructed such that it is hard to guess (see C8 of
      [RFC5808]), and the set of entities that it is disclosed to can be
      limited.  The only authentication this would require by the LS is
      evidence of possession of the URI.  The LS could immediately
      authorize any request that indicates this URI.

      Authorization by possession does not require direct interaction
      with Rule Maker; it is assumed that the Rule Maker is able to
      exert control over the distribution of the location URI.
      Therefore, the LIS can operate with limited policy input from a
      Rule Maker.

      Limited disclosure is an important aspect of this authorization
      model.  The location URI is a secret; therefore, ensuring that
      adversaries are not able to acquire this information is paramount.
      Encryption, such as might be offered by TLS [RFC5246] or S/MIME
      [RFC5751], protects the information from eavesdroppers.

      Using possession as a basis for authorization means that, once
      granted, authorization cannot be easily revoked.  Cancellation of
      a location URI ensures that legitimate users are also affected;
      application of additional policy is theoretically possible but
      could be technically infeasible.  Expiration of location URIs



Tschofenig, et. al            Informational                    [Page 12]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Trustworthy Location             13 March 2013


      limits the usable time for a location URI, requiring that an
      attacker continue o learn new location URIs to retain access to
      current location information.

   In situations where "Authorization by Possession" is not suitable
   (such as where location hiding [RFC6444] is required), the
   "Authorization via Access Control Lists" model may be preferred.

   Without the introduction of hierarchy, it would be necessary for the
   PSAP to obtain client certificates or Digest credentials for all the
   LISes in its coverage area, to enable it to successfully dereference
   LbyRs.  In situations with more than a few LISes per PSAP, this would
   present operational challenges.

   A certificate hierarchy providing PSAPs with client certificates
   chaining to the VESA could be used to enable the LIS to authenticate
   and authorize PSAPs for dereferencing.  Note that unlike PIDF-LO
   signing (which mitigates against modification of PIDF-LOs), this
   merely provides the PSAP with access to a (potentially unsigned)
   PIDF-LO, albeit over a protected TLS channel.

   Another approach would be for the local LIS to upload location
   information to a location aggregation point who would in turn manage
   the relationships with the PSAP.  This would shift the management
   burden from the PSAPs to the location aggregation points.

3.3.  Proxy Adding Location

   Instead of relying upon the end host to provide location, is possible
   for a proxy that has the ability to determine the location of the end
   point (e.g., based on the end host IP or MAC address) to retrieve and
   add or override location information.

   The use of proxy-added location is primarily applicable in scenarios
   where the end host does not provide location.  As noted in [RFC6442]
   Section 4.1:

      A SIP intermediary SHOULD NOT add location to a SIP request that
      already contains location.  This will quite often lead to
      confusion within LRs.  However, if a SIP intermediary adds
      location, even if location was not previously present in a SIP
      request, that SIP intermediary is fully responsible for addressing
      the concerns of any 424 (Bad Location Information) SIP response it
      receives about this location addition and MUST NOT pass on
      (upstream) the 424 response.  A SIP intermediary that adds a
      locationValue MUST position the new locationValue as the last
      locationValue within the Geolocation header field of the SIP
      request.



Tschofenig, et. al            Informational                    [Page 13]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Trustworthy Location             13 March 2013


      A SIP intermediary MAY add a Geolocation header field if one is
      not present -- for example, when a user agent does not support the
      Geolocation mechanism but their outbound proxy does and knows the
      Target's location, or any of a number of other use cases (see
      Section 3).

   As noted in [RFC6442] Section 3.3:

      This document takes a "you break it, you bought it" approach to
      dealing with second locations placed into a SIP request by an
      intermediary entity.  That entity becomes completely responsible
      for all location within that SIP request (more on this in Section
      4).

   While it is possible for the proxy to override location included by
   the end host, [RFC6442] Section 3.4 notes the operational
   limitations:

      Overriding location information provided by the user requires a
      deployment where an intermediary necessarily knows better than an
      end user -- after all, it could be that Alice has an on-board GPS,
      and the SIP intermediary only knows her nearest cell tower.  Which
      is more accurate location information? Currently, there is no way
      to tell which entity is more accurate or which is wrong, for that
      matter.  This document will not specify how to indicate which
      location is more accurate than another.

   The disadvantage of this approach is the need to deploy application
   layer entities, such as SIP proxies, at AIPs or associated with AIPs.
   This requires a standardized VoIP profile to be deployed at every end
   device and at every AIP.  This might impose interoperability
   challenges.

   Additionally, the AIP needs to take responsibility for emergency
   calls, even for customers they have no direct or indirect
   relationship with.  To provide identity information about the
   emergency caller from the VSP it would be necessary to let the AIP
   and the VSP to interact for authentication (see, for example,
   [RFC4740]).  This interaction along the Authentication, Authorization
   and Accounting infrastructure is often based on business
   relationships between the involved entities.  The AIP and the VSP are
   very likely to have no such business relationship, particularly when
   talking about an arbitrary VSP somewhere on the Internet.  In case
   that the interaction between the AIP and the VSP fails due to the
   lack of a business relationship then typically a fall-back would be
   provided where no emergency caller identity information is made
   available to the PSAP and the emergency call still has to be
   completed.

4.  Location Trust Assessment

   The ability to assess the level of trustworthiness of conveyed
   location information is important, since this makes it possible to
   understand how much value should be placed on location information,
   as part of the decision making process.  As an example, if automated
   location information is understood to be highly suspect, a call taker
   can put more effort into obtaining location information from the
   caller.

   Caller accountability is another important aspect of trust
   assessment.  Can the individual purchasing the device or activating
   service be identified or did the call originate from a non-service
   initialized (NSI) device whose owner cannot be determined?  Prior to
   the call, was the caller authenticated at the network or application
   layer?  In the event of a prank call, can audit logs be made
   available to an investigator, or can information relating to the
   owner of an unlinked pseudonym be provided, enabling investigators to
   unravel the chain of events that lead to the attack?  In practice,
   the ability to identify a caller may decrease the likelihood of
   caller misbehavior.  For example, where emergency calls have been
   allowed from handsets lacking a SIM card, or where ownership of the
   SIM card cannot be determined, the frequency of nuisance calls has
   often been unacceptably high [TASMANIA][UK][SA].

   Note that location trust assessment has value regardless of whether
   the location has been conveyed securely (via signed location,
   location-by-reference or proxy-added location) or not (via location-
   by-value without location signing), since secure conveyance does not
   provide assurance relating to the validity or provenance of location
   data.

   In practice, the source of the location data is important for
   location trust assessment.  For example, location provided by a
   Location Information Server (LIS) whose administrator has an
   established history of meeting emergency location accuracy
   requirements (e.g. Phase II) may be considered more reliable than
   location information provided by a third party Location Service
   Provider (LSP) that disclaims use of location information for
   emergency purposes.

   However, even where an LSP does not attempt to meet the accuracy
   requirements for emergency location, it still may be able to provide
   information useful in assessing about how reliable location
   information is likely to be.  For example,  was location determined
   based on the nearest cell tower or 802.11 Access Point (AP), or was a
   triangulation method used?  If based on cell tower or AP location
   data, was the information obtained from an authoritative source (e.g.



Tschofenig, et. al            Informational                    [Page 15]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Trustworthy Location             13 March 2013


   the tower or AP owner) and when was the last time that the location
   of the tower or access point was verified?

   For real-time validation, information in the signaling and media
   packets can be cross checked against location information.  For
   example, it may be possible to determine the region associated with
   the IP address included within SIP Via: or Contact: headers, or the
   media source address, and compare this against the location
   information reported by the caller or conveyed in the PIDF-LO.  While
   a CAPTCHA-style test may be applied to suspicious calls to lower the
   risk from bot-nets, this is quite controversial for emergency
   services, due to the risk of delaying or rejecting valid calls.

   Although privacy-preserving procedures may be disabled for emergency
   calls, by design, PIDF-LO objects limit the information available for
   real-time attribution.  As noted in [RFC5985] Section 6.6:

      The LIS MUST NOT include any means of identifying the Device in
      the PIDF-LO unless it is able to verify that the identifier is
      correct and inclusion of identity is expressly permitted by a Rule
      Maker.  Therefore, PIDF parameters that contain identity are
      either omitted or contain unlinked pseudonyms [RFC3693].  A
      unique, unlinked presentity URI SHOULD be generated by the LIS for
      the mandatory presence "entity" attribute of the PIDF document.
      Optional parameters such as the "contact" and "deviceID" elements
      [RFC4479] are not used.

   Also, the device referred to in the PIDF-LO may not necessarily be
   the same entity conveying the PIDF-LO to the PSAP.  As noted in
   [RFC6442] Section 1:

      In no way does this document assume that the SIP user agent client
      that sends a request containing a location object is necessarily
      the Target.  The location of a Target conveyed within SIP
      typically corresponds to that of a device controlled by the
      Target, for example, a mobile phone, but such devices can be
      separated from their owners, and moreover, in some cases, the user
      agent may not know its own location.

   Due to these design choices, it is possible for an attacker to cut
   and paste a PIDF-LO obtained by a different device or user into a SIP
   INVITE and send this to the PSAP.  While PIDF-LO signing would
   prevent modification of a PIDF-LO or invention of one out of whole
   cloth, it would not prevent this cut and paste attack.  Neither would
   implementation of "Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management
   in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" [RFC4474], allowing the
   recipient to verify the identity assertion in the From: header.
   However, while it might not be possible to detect the cut and paste



Tschofenig, et. al            Informational                    [Page 16]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Trustworthy Location             13 March 2013


   in real-time, examination of the audit logs might provide enough
   information to enable events to be reconstructed.

   Real-time validation of the timestamp contained within PIDF-LO
   objects (reflecting the time at which the location was determined) is
   also challenging.  Even if the PIDF-LO is signed the timestamp only
   represents an assertion by the LIS, which may or may not be
   trustworthy.  For example, the recipient of the signed PIDF-LO may
   not know whether the LIS supports time synchronization, or whether it
   is possible to reset the LIS clock manually without detection.  Even
   if the timestamp was valid at the time location was determined, a
   time period may elapse between when the PIDF-LO was provided and when
   it is conveyed to the recipient.  Periodically refreshing location
   information to renew the timestamp even though the location
   information itself is unchanged puts additional load on LISes.  As a
   result, recipients need to validate the timestamp in order to
   determine whether it is credible.

   While this document focuses on the discussion of real-time
   determination of suspicious emergency calls, the use of audit logs
   may help in enforcing accountability among emergency callers.  For
   example, in the event of a prank call, information relating to the
   owner of the unlinked pseudonym could be provided to investigators,
   enabling them to unravel the chain of events that lead to the attack.
   However, while auditability is an important deterrent, it is likely
   to be of most benefit in situations where attacks on the emergency
   services system are likely to be relatively infrequent, since the
   resources required to pursue an investigation are likely to be
   considerable.  However, although real-time validation based on PIDF-
   LO elements is challenging, where LIS audit logs are available (such
   as where a law enforcement agency can present a subpoena), linking of
   a pseudonym to the device obtaining location can be accomplished in a
   post-mortem.

   Where attacks are frequent and continuous, automated mechanisms are
   required.  For example, it might be valuable to develop mechanisms to
   exchange audit trails information in a standardized format between
   ISPs and PSAPs / VSPs and PSAPs or heuristics to distinguish
   potentially fraudulent emergency calls from real emergencies.

5.  Security Considerations

   IP-based emergency services face a number of security threats that do
   not exist within the legacy system.  In order to limit prank calls,
   legacy emergency services rely on the ability to identify callers, as
   well as on the difficulty of location spoofing for normal users.  The
   ability to ascertain identity is important, since the threat of
   punishment reduces prank calls; as an example, calls from pay phones



Tschofenig, et. al            Informational                    [Page 17]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Trustworthy Location             13 March 2013


   are subject to greater scrutiny by the call taker.

   Mechanically placing a large number of emergency calls that appear to
   come from different locations is difficult in a legacy environment.
   Also, in the current system, it would be very difficult for an
   attacker from country 'Foo' to attack the emergency services
   infrastructure located in country 'Bar'.

   However, within an IP-based emergency services a number of these
   attacks become much easier to mount.  Emergency services have three
   finite resources subject to denial of service attacks:  the network
   and server infrastructure, call takers and dispatchers, and the first
   responders, such as fire fighters and police officers.  Protecting
   the network infrastructure is similar to protecting other high-value
   service providers, except that location information may be used to
   filter call setup requests, to weed out requests that are out of
   area.  PSAPs even for large cities may only have a handful of PSAP
   call takers on duty, so even if they can, by questioning the caller,
   eliminate a lot of prank calls, they are quickly overwhelmed by even
   a small-scale attack.  Finally, first responder resources are scarce,
   particularly during mass-casualty events.

   Attackers may want to modify, prevent or delay emergency calls.  In
   some cases, this will lead the PSAP to dispatch emergency personnel
   to an emergency that does not exist and, hence, the personnel might
   not be available to other callers.  It might also be possible for an
   attacker to impede the users from reaching an appropriate PSAP by
   modifying the location of an end host or the information returned
   from the mapping protocol.  In some countries, regulators may not
   require the authenticated identity of the emergency caller, as is
   true for PSTN-based emergency calls placed from pay phones or SIM-
   less cell phones today.  Furthermore, if identities can easily be
   crafted (as it is the case with many VoIP offerings today), then the
   value of emergency caller authentication itself might be limited.  As
   a consequence, an attacker can forge emergency call information
   without the chance of being held accountable for its own actions.

   The above-mentioned attacks are mostly targeting individual emergency
   callers or a very small fraction of them.  If attacks are, however,
   launched against the mapping architecture (see [RFC5582] or against
   the emergency services IP network (including PSAPs), a larger region
   and a large number of potential emergency callers are affected.  The
   call takers themselves are a particularly scarce resource and if
   human interaction by these call takers is required then this can very
   quickly have severe consequences.

   Although it is important to ensure that location information cannot
   be faked there will be many GPS-enabled devices that will find it

   difficult to utilize any of the solutions described in Section 3.  It
   is also unlikely that users will be willing to upload their location
   information for "verification" to a nearby location server located in
   the access network.
