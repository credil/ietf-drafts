   Benchmarking Methodology for Evaluating the Security Effectiveness
                        of Content Aware Devices
                 draft-green-bmwg-seceff-bench-meth-01


Abstract

   This document defines a methodology for evaluating the ability of
   content-aware network devices to correctly detect and block malicious
   or administratively disallowed traffic flows. This benchmark
   addresses the issue of classification accuracy under well defined
   conditions. It is not concerned with measuring forwarding performance
   which is covered by other BMWG documents.

INTERNET DRAFT     Security Effectiveness Methodology         March 2012


1  Introduction

   Networks of the 21st century exist in an environment flooded with
   complex and highly sophisticated security threats. There is an
   intense and enduring arms race under way between those developing and
   distributing attack technology and those developing and supplying
   defense technology.

   In addition there is a growing need to limit access by users inside
   private or corporate networks to Internet sites or services deemed
   undesirable and to ensure that intellectual property and other
   private information is not allowed to pass freely from inside the
   protected network to the outside world.

   In response to the this dynamic and constantly expanding range of
   security threats and privacy requirements there is a growing
   diversity of network devices that provide a variety of defensive
   services including but not limited to firewall, intrusion detection,
   intrusion prevention, anti-virus, anti-malware, anti-spam, anti-dos,
   anti-ddos, unified threat management, data leakage prevention and
   more. These content-aware devices use a mixture of stateless and
   stateful L3 to L7 technologies, including deep packet inspection
   (DPI), to categorize traffic flows.

   What all of these defensive solutions have in common is the
   requirement that they reliably and accurately distinguish between
   legal (benign and allowed) traffic and illegal (malicious or
   disallowed) traffic.

   Categorization of traffic as either legal or illegal is fundamental
   to the operation of these devices since it is a prerequisite to all
   security functions.

   Security Effectiveness is a measure of how accurately the device
   under test (DUT) categorizes traffic:

      o No false negatives = correctly blocks all illegal traffic

      o No false positives = never blocks legal traffic

   In contrast, Security Performance is the characterization of the
   DUT's forwarding performance while under attack. Security Performance
   measures how well the device forwards legal traffic with security
   features enabled and in the presence of illegal traffic. This is
   addressed in [HAMILTON].

   Security Effectiveness is orthogonal to Security Performance.

1.1  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



2  Terminology

2.1  Existing Terminology

2.1.1  Illegal Traffic

   Definition:
      Illegal traffic is defined by [RFC2647] as "Packets specified for
      rejection in the rule set of the DUT/SUT".

   Discussion:
      That definition is interpreted in this context to be any illicit
      traffic flow which should be blocked by the DUT. That means
      illegal traffic is either malicious (i.e. part of a deliberate
      attack) or administratively banned (i.e. disallowed from passing
      in to or out of the protected network due to its content and/or
      destination).

   Unit of measurement:
      not applicable

   Issues:

2.2  New Terminology

2.2.1  Attack

   Definition:
      An attack is an attempt to transmit illegal traffic across the
      DUT.

   Discussion:
      Attacks can be classified as follows:

         Attempted = injected into the DUT

         Blocked = dropped by the DUT

         Successful = passed through the DUT

INTERNET DRAFT     Security Effectiveness Methodology         March 2012


      A successful attack indicates a failure by the DUT to recognize
      and block the illegal traffic.

   Unit of measurement:
      not applicable

   Issues:

   See also:
      legal traffic

2.2.1  Legal Traffic

   Definition:
      Legal traffic is any traffic flow which should not be blocked by
      the DUT.

   Discussion:
       Legal traffic is implicitly benign and allowed.

   Unit of measurement:
      not applicable

   Issues:

   See also:
      illegal traffic


3  Test Setup

3.1  Application Traffic Mix

   Some test cases require the test equipment to inject legal traffic
   mixed with the illegal traffic. The purpose of the legal traffic is
   to force the DUT to distinguish between legal and illegal traffic and
   it is not used to quantify the forwarding performance of the DUT from
   an application perspective.

   Given this purpose, in order to protect the integrity and
   repeatability of the benchmark, a single fixed definition of the
   legal traffic application mix is provided. No attempt is made to
   accurately model any particular mix of application traffic such as
   might be seen in an operational network.

   Rather, the traffic mix includes an appropriate mix of traffic types
   to ensure that the security engine cannot blindly assume that every
   packet is either legal or illegal and so deliver unrealistically high

   performance or otherwise undermine the benchmark.

   In those test scenarios where application traffic is specified, the
   following mix MUST be used:

   *** TBD but likely to include at least UDP, TCP, HTTP ***


4  Benchmarking Tests

4.1  Attack-only Blocking Rate

   Attack-only Blocking Rate (attacks/second) is defined as the largest
   number of attacks per second where 100% of attacks are blocked with
   no application traffic present.

4.2  Error-free Attack Blocking Rate

   Error-free Attack Blocking Rate (attacks/second) is defined as the
   largest number of attacks per second where 100% of attacks are
   blocked in the presence of legal traffic and 0% of the legal traffic
   is blocked or dropped.

4.3  Attack Blocking Effectiveness

   Attack Blocking Effectiveness (percentage) is the ratio of blocked
   attacks/attempted attacks counted over the total number of different
   types of attack in the presence of legal traffic and where 0% of the
   legal traffic is dropped or blocked.


5  Security Considerations

   Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory
   environment, with dedicated address space and the other constraints
   defined in [RFC2544].

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.

   Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically for
   benchmarking purposes.  Any implications for network security arising

   from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production
   networks.


6  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
