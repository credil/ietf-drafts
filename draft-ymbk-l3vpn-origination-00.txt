               Authenticating L3VPN Origination Signaling
                    draft-ymbk-l3vpn-origination-00

Abstract

   A BGP-signaled Layer-3 VPN's prefix bindings sent over BGP are
   subject to unintentional errors, both by the legitimate originator
   and by non-legitimate origins.  This is of special concern if the VPN
   traverses untrusted networks.  This document describes how the sender
   of the VPN/Prefix binding may sign it so that recipient of the
   binding may authenticate it.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to
   be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] only when they
   appear in all upper case.  They may also appear in lower or mixed
   case as English words, without normative meaning.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 4364 [RFC4364] Section 7.4 describes how a Customer Edge (CE)
   router uses eBGP to announce to a Provider Edge (PE) router the
   address prefix(es) the customer provides to an L3VPN.  It is possible
   that the originator of such an announcement could unintentionally
   announce prefixes they do not own.

            Cust(West)-CE--PE-Provider(West)--TransitA-~
                  ~-TransitB--Provider(East)-PE--CE-Cust(East)

   This document describes how the originating PE, West, may sign the
   announcement so that the destination PE, East, may authenticate the
   NLRI and the Route Distinguisher (RD), , see RFC 4364 [RFC4364]
   Section 4.3.1.  Alternatively, the originating CE router may sign the
   announcement so that the destination CE router may authenticate the
   NLRI.

   It is assumed that the Providers already have the key creation,
   storage, and distribution infrastructure needed.  For example, the
   Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) could be used, see RFC 6480
   [RFC6480].

2.  NLRI Deaggregation

Internet-Draft Authenticating L3VPN Origination Signaling   October 2012


   Normally, a BGP Update may contain multiple NLRI which all share the
   identical set of attributes.  As L3VPN Origin Signalling Updates sign
   over the NLRI, and NLRI can become separated as they transit the
   network,  separation would break the signature.  Therefore, an L3VPN
   Origin Signalling MUST contain one and only one NLRI.

3.  L3VPN Origination BGP Path Attribute

   The L3VPN Origination Path Attribute is a BGP optional transitive
   Path Attribute RFC 4271 [RFC4271].  BGP Path Attributes are Type/
   Length/Value tuples.

   The Attribute Type is two octets, the first of which, Attribute
   Flags, MUST have the two high order bits set to signify that
   attribute is optional and transitive.

   The second octet of the Attribute Flags, Attribute Type, MUST be set
   to 0xXX, as assigned by the IANA, see Section 6, to signal that this
   is an L3VPN Origination BGP Path Attribute.

   The Length field is one or two octets with a value of the number of
   octets in the entire attribute.  If the length of the Path Attribute
   is less than 256 octets, only the first octet of the length field is
   used.  Otherwise, both octets are used to represent the Length..  See
   RFC 4271 [RFC4271] Section 4.2 for another explation of this byte
   saving.

   The Key Identifier is an eight octet nonce identifying the key (pair)
   used for the Signature.  It is used when the keying is not implied by
   the NLRI, as it would be if the RPKI was used.  If not used to
   identify the key, it MUST be zero.

   The Algorithm Suite is a one-octet identifier specifying the digest
   algorithm and digital signature algorithm used to produce the
   Signature.  The values reference the IANA regietry for Algorithm
   Identifiers from BGPsec, see [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-algs].

   The Signature Length is two octets and is the number of octets in the
   Signature field.

   The Signature field is a digital signature that covers the NLRI, the
   RD, and the Key Identifier.  If the L3VPN Origination Path Attribute
   is generated by a CE router, eight zero octets MUST be used as the
   value of the RD.

   To compute the Signature, the digest algorithm for the specified
   Algorithm Suite is applied to the catenation of the NLRI, the RD, and
   the Key Identifier.  This is then fed to the signature algorithm for
   the specified algorithm suite and the resulting value is the
   Signature.

      Signature = sign ( hash ( NLRI || RD || Key Identifier ) )

4.  Notes

   The keying could either come from the Global RPKI or the customer or
   carrier running their own PKI.  The keying is assumed to be
   asymmetric, but possibly could be symmetric.

   If the RPKI is used, and the public key is taken from the CA
   certificate which owns the NLRI, the classic problem arises where all
   the NLRI on that certificate share fate.  I.e.  if one causes the
   need for a re-key, then all must re-key.  RPKI-based origin
   validation solves this problem by a level of indirection, the CA
   certificate is used to sign an End Entity (EE) certificate which
   signs a Route Origin Authorization (ROA), see RFC 6480 [RFC6480] and
   RFC 6482 [RFC6482].  As the RD of an L3VPN signal is larger than the
   four octets of a ROA, a new RPKI object, for the moment let's call it
   a VOA, would have to be defined and then it would have to be carried
   in the RPKI-Router Protocol [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr].

   Validation needs detail.  E.g.  what should be done if the relying
   party can not find the matching key.

5.  Security Considerations

   Signing (NLRI||RD||Key Identifier) with the key of the NLRI-owner or
   some other pre-agreed key, only says that the contents were produced
   by the owner of the key (NLRI or other), and that no one in between
   has changed the (NLRI||RD||Key Identifier).  That is the threat
   model, which seems trivial.  If we were trying to protect against an
   attacking PE replaying a signed (NLRI||RD||Key Identifier) it has no
   business announcing, this design does not help.

   It would be quite ill-advised to use the Key Identifier method with
   the same keying used for more than one VPN.

   Adding a VOA which binds ( NLRI || ND || Key Identifier ) still could
   be replayed from anywhere so really offers nothing.  Like RPKI-based
   origin validation, this only catches fat fingers, not black hats.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the IANA create a new entry in the BGP Path
   Attributes Registry as follows:
