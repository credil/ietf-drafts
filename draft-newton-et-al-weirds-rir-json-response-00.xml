            <t> This document describes responses in the JSON format to the RESTful queries
                described in draft-newton-et-al-weirds-rir-query. </t>
        </abstract>

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t> The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) have begun experimenting with RESTful web
                services for access to Whois data. draft-newton-et-al-weirds-rir-query presents
                uniform patterns which may be used to contruct URLs for accessing data from these
                RESTful web services. This document describes responses in the JSON serialization
                format to the query URLs in draft-newton-et-al-weirds-rir-query. </t>
            <t> As this document describes responses returned in JSON format, other documents may
                describe responses in other formats to the same URL queries. </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Signalling for JSON">
            <t> To receive JSON responses, clients SHOULD put the "application/json" MIME type in
                the Accept header. Servers SHOULD respond with JSON responses when this MIME type is
                present in the Accept header in accordance with the preference rules for the Accept
                header in HTTP, however the use of multiple MIME types in the Accept header is NOT
                RECOMMENDED. </t>
        </section>
        <section title="JSON Naming">
            <t> Clients processing JSON responses SHOULD ignore values associated with unrecognized
                names. Servers MAY insert values signified by names into the JSON responses which
                are not specified in this document. Insertion of unspecified values into JSON
                responses SHOULD have names prefixed with a short identifier followed by an
                underscore followed by a meaningful name. </t>
            <t> For example, "handle" is specified in this document as the name of a value which
                is a string containing an RIR unique identifier for a registration. The RIR of the
                Moon might desire to insert a value specific to their services denoting that a
                registration occured before or after the first moon landing. The name for such a
                value might take the form "lunarNic_beforeOneSmallStep". </t>
            <t> JSON names SHOULD NOT contain punctuation, whitespace, or other characters typically
                not allowed in variable names of modern programming languages. This better enables
                clients to automatically promote JSON values to first order object attributes or
                members using the given JSON names. Using the examples above, a Java or Ruby
                programmer working with such a framework may be able to reference the values as
                network.handle or network.lunarNic_beforeOneSmallStep.</t>
            <t> Clients processing JSON responses MUST be prepared for values specified in this
                document to be absent from a response as no JSON value listed in this document
                is required to appear in the response. In other words, servers MAY remove
                values as is needed by the policies of the server operator.</t>

        <section title="Responses" anchor="responses">
            <t> As specified in draft-newton-et-al-weirds-rir-query, queries for resources and information
                can be made for three types of information: 1) information about IP networks,
                2) information about autonomous system numbers, and 3) information about reverse DNS
                delegations. Queries for each of these three types can be constructed to target
                specific information:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>operator information (e.g. "/operator")</t>
                    <t>contacts of the operator (e.g "/operator/contacts")</t>
                    <t>specific types of contacts of the operator (e.g. "/operator/contacts/abuse")</t>
                    <t>registration information about the networks, AS numbers, or DNS delegations (e.g. "/registration")</t>
                    <t>all of the above (e.g. "/")</t>

        <section title="The Entity Object" anchor="entity_object">
            <t> Throughout this document there is a need to represent the identity and contact
                information of organizations, corporations, governments, non-profits, clubs,
                individual persons, and informal groups of people. All of these representations are
                so similar that it is best to represent them in JSON with one construct, the entity
                object. Such re-use is beleived to aid in the re-use of code by implementers. </t>
