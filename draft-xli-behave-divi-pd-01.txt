  dIVI-pd: Dual-Stateless IPv4/IPv6 Translation with Prefix Delegation
                      draft-xli-behave-divi-pd-01

Abstract

   This document presents the address specifications and deployment
   considerations of address-sharing dual stateless IPv4/IPv6
   translation with prefix delegation (dIVI-pd).  The dIVI-pd keeps the
   features of stateless, end-to-end address transparency and
   bidirectional-initiated communications of the original stateless
   IPv4/IPv6 translation, while it can utilize the IPv4 addresses more
   effectively.  In addition, it does not require the DNS64 and ALG, and
   can be used with prefix delegation.

1.  Introduction

   The experiences for the IPv6 deployment in the past 10 years strongly
   indicate that for a successful transition, the communication between
   IPv4 and IPv6 address families should be supported.

   Recently, the stateless and stateful IPv4/IPv6 translation methods
   are developed and became the IETF standards.  The original stateless
   IPv4/IPv6 translation (stateless 1:1 IVI) is scalable, maintains the
   end-to-end address transparency and support both IPv6 initiated and
   IPv4 initiated communications [RFC6052], [RFC6144], [RFC6145],
   [RFC6147], [RFC6219].  But it can not use the IPv4 addresses
   effectively.  The stateful IPv4/IPv6 translation can share the IPv4
   addresses among IPv6 hosts, but it only supports IPv6 initiated
   communication [RFC6052], [RFC6144], [RFC6145], [RFC6146], [RFC6147].
   In addition, both stateless and stateful IPv4/IPv6 translation
   technologies require the application layer gateway (ALG) for the
   applications which embed IP address literals.  Furthermore, in ADSL
   and 3G environment, it requires the prefix delegation (assigning an
   IPv6 /64 or shorter) to the customer router/L3-device rather than
   assigning a single IPv4-translatable address to the customer device
   defined in [RFC6052].

   In this document, we present address specifications and deployment
   considerations for address-sharing dual stateless IPv4/IPv6
   translation with prefix delegation (dIVI-pd), which is based on basic
   dIVI model [I-D.xli-behave-divi] with the support of prefix
   delegation.  The dIVI-pd can solve the IPv4 address sharing, the ALG
   and prefix delegation problems mentioned above, though still keeps
   the stateless, end-to-end address transparency and supporting of both
   IPv6 initiated and IPv4 initiated communications.

   The dIVI-pd is in the family of stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation,
   alone with IVI and dIVI.  These techniques are used for the following
   scenarios defined in [RFC6144].

   o  Scenario 1: An IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet.

   o  Scenario 2: The IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network.

   o  Scenario 5: An IPv6 network to an IPv4 network.

   o  Scenario 6: An IPv4 network to an IPv6 network.

2.  Applicability

   The address-sharing dual stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation with prefix
   delegation (dIVI-pd) can be used in ADSL or 3G environment when
   prefix delegation is required.  An ADSL example is shown in the
   following figure.

   Where the ISP's backbone network is dual stack, as well as part of
   the metro-area network.  The core IPv4/IPv6 translator (XLAT1) is
   performing the IPv4 address-sharing stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation
   and connects the dual-stack part and the IPv6-only part of the metro-
   area networks.  The access network is IPv6-only and multiple IPv4/
   IPv6 translators (XLAT2.x) are connected to the access network and
   provide dual-stack access to the customer devices.  Each dual-stack
   customer get a whole IPv6 /64 (or shorter) and a fractional public
   IPv4 address.

   The data path of this user case are: The IPv6 packets from customer
   devices and the IPv6 Internet are not translated, while the IPv4
   packets from customer devices and the IPv4 Internet are translated
   twice via stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation technology.  Due to the

   stateless nature, the dual stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation is almost
   equivalent to tunneling with header compression.

   There are two address assignment processes: (1) From BRAS to CPE is
   via IPv6CP and DHCPv6 prefix delegation; (2) From CPE to customer
   device, the IPv6 is via SLAAC and the IPv4 is via DHCP.  Note that if
   more than one customer device requires IPv4 addresses, a built-in
   NAT44 in each CPE can be used to translate a fractional IPv4 address
   to several [RFC1918] defined IPv4 addresses.


3.  Terminologies

   This document uses the terminologies defined in [RFC6144].

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


4.  Address Specifications

   The address-sharing dual stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation with prefix
   delegation (dIVI-pd) requires the header translation specifications
   defined in [RFC6145].

   In addition, it uses the address format of PL=64 defined in Figure 1
   of [RFC6052] with two kind of extensions (CPE index and suffix), as
   shown in the following figure.

4.1.  Attributes

   A dIVI-pd system has the following attributes used in the
   algorithmatic mapping process:

   1.  Domain prefix

   This parameter is assigned by the network operator per dIVI-pd domain
   and used by the XLAT1 and CPEs for constructing the delegated
   prefixes for each CPE.  The length of the domain prefix is (d) bits.

   2.  Total number of CPEs in this domain

   The total number of CPEs served in a specific domain determines the
   length of the CPE index (s+k) bits.

   3.  IPv4 Address sharing ratio

   Each dIVI-pd domain is assigned a target IPv4 address-sharing ratio
   N, as a power of 2, for addresses assigned to that domain.

   4.  Prefix length assigned to a specific CPE

   For a customer with IPv6 prefix delegation, the longest prefix length
   is /64.  However, other prefix lengths are also permitted, for
   example /63, /62, ..., /56.  The length of prefix delegation
   determines the zero padding length (m).

   5.  CPE index

   The CPE index is used to uniquely identify different CPEs in the
   specific domain.  The length of the CPE index is (s+k) bits.

   6.  Suffix

   The suffix is used for several IPv6 nodes sharing an IPv4 address,
   with each node managing a different range of ports.  The suffix
   contains the IPv4 address sharing ratio N of 4 bits and the Port-set
   ID of 12 bits, so the length of suffix is 16 bits, fixed.  Note that
   the suffix is the same as in [I-D.xli-behave-divi].  This makes the
   CPE working in both dIVI and dIVI-pd environment.

4.2.  CPE index Coding

   The CPE index is used to uniquely identify different CPEs in the
   specific domain.  For the reason of simplicity, the CPE index
   consists of (k) bits identifying the IPv4 devices using different
   port-sets of same IPv4 address and (s) bits for the IPv4 subnet to

   serve for this specific domain.

4.3.  Suffix Coding

   The suffix is used for several IPv6 nodes sharing an IPv4 address,
   with each node managing a different range of ports
   [I-D.xli-behave-divi].  The most significant 4 bits define the
   multiplexing ratio and the least significant 12 bits define the IPv6
   node index.  The multiplexing ratio, the suffix range and the number
   of corresponding concurrent ports are as shown in the following
   figure.

                  ratio  | suffix range   | # of  Ports

4.4.  Port-set algorithm

   The algorithm used to derive available port-set for a specific CPE,
   or by XLAT1 to construct, per domain, the CPE index based on an IPv4
   address and TCP/UDP port.

   For a domain's multiplexing ratio N, the port-set numbers of a CPE
   with port-set-id K is composed of P=j*N + K + 1024, for all the
   values of j=0, 1, ..., (65536-N)/N.

   For a destination port number (P), the port-set-id of a given CPE
   with port-set-id K is determined by the modulo operation: K=((P-
   1024)%N) (% is the Modulus Operator).

4.5.  Domain prefix selection

   The domain prefix is inside the ISP prefix.  The domain prefix length
   (d) can be determined by

   (d)=64-(s)-(k)-(m)

   Where (s) is the number of bits of the IPv4 subnet, (k) is the bits
   representing different port-set ID sharing the same IPv4 address and
   (m) is the number of bits representing the size of the PD compared
   with standard PD (/64).  When the domain prefix length is determined,
   the domain prefix can be selected by network administrator.


5.  Deployment Considerations

5.1.  IPv4-converted address

   The IPv4-converted address is for presenting the IPv4 hosts in the
   IPv4 Internet.  For avoiding the collision between IPv4-converted
   address and SLAAC address, a common IPv4-converted address block
   (/64) is selected for all CPEs in the specific domain.  This IPv4-
   converted address block is a subset of the domain prefix and it can
   use the IPv4 subnet identifier or broadcast address, therefore, the
   IPv6-converted address block is different from all CPE prefix without
   wasting the IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses.

5.2.  IPv4-translatable address

   In order to minimize the operational overhead, it is desirable to
   delegate a single prefix (IPv6 /64 or shorter) to each customer for
   SLAAC and this prefix also contains the IPv4-translatable address for
   communicating with the IPv4 Internet.  It can be shown that the
   probability of collision between SLAAC and Ipv4-translatable address
   is almost zero.

   Since the IPv4-converted addresses and IPv4-translatable addresses
   are using different prefixes in this case, the hairpin function is
   required, which can be done in XLAT1 or in BRAS/SR using IPv6-to-IPv6
   Network Prefix Translation discussed in [RFC6296].

5.4.  Dual translation

   The advantage of dual IVI is that the DNS64/DNS46 and ALG are not
   required.

   Special MTU and fragmentation actions must be taken in the case of
   dual translation.


6.  Experimental Evaluation

   The basic stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation (IVI) has been deployed
   since 2007.  It connects [CERNET] and [CNGI-CERNET2].

   The dual stateless translation with IPv4 address sharing (dIVI) has
   been deployed in [CERNET] and [CNGI-CERNET2] since 2009.  The design
   and implementation results are presented in [I-D.xli-behave-divi].

   The dIVI has also been tested in China Telecom.  The
   [I-D.sunq-v6ops-ivi-sp] summarizes the testing results.

   The dIVI-pd presented in this document has been running in [CERNET]
   and [CNGI-CERNET2] since Jan. 2011.  The experimental results
   indicate that the CPE index coding, the suffix coding and port-set ID
   mapping algorithm work for existing applications without any problem.


7.  Security Considerations

   See security considerations presented in [RFC6052] and [RFC6145].


8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo adds no new IANA considerations.

   Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
   correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are
   required, or if those assignments or registries are created during
   the RFC publication process.  From the author's perspective, it may
   therefore be removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor's
   discretion.

Appendix A.  Example of dual-stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation with prefix
             delegation (dIVI-pd)

   Assume:

   1.  ISP prefix is 2001:db8::/32.

   2.  Total number of CPEs in this domain is 30

   3.  Address sharing ratio N=16.  This means that k=4 bits.

   4.  Prefix length assigned to a specific CPE is /63.  This means that
   m=1 bit.

   5.  The length of IPv4 subnet s=2 bits.  This is obtained by 30/16
   and note the fact that an IPv4 /30 should be used for 2 IPv4 hosts.

   6.  Suffix has 16 bits, fixed.

   7.  Domain prefix length d=64-s-k-m=64-2-4-1=57 bits.  For
   operational convenience, we can make it in the 8 bit boundary of the
   IPv6 address, this results in d=56 bits.  Then we choose 2001:db8:
   a4a6:4600::/56 as the domain prefix.

   The serial number of CPE, the IPv4 addresses and the constructed
   IPv4-translatable addresses are shown in the following figure, where
   v and h represent the IPv4 subnet (hex) and host index (hex),
   respectively.

   Note that the CPE prefixes can be obtained from corresponding IPv4-
   translatable addresses, for example 2001:db8:a4a6:4610:c0:a801:140:0
   results in 2001:db8:a4a6:4610::/63.

   A common IPv4-converted address block can be selected as 2001:db8:
   a4a6:4690::/64.
