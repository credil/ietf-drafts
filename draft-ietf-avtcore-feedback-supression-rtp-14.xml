    <abstract>
      <t>In a large RTP session using the RTCP feedback mechanism defined in
      RFC 4585, a feedback target may experience transient overload if some
      event causes a large number of receivers to send feedback at once. This
      overload is usually avoided by ensuring that feedback reports are
      forwarded to all receivers, allowing them to avoid sending duplicate
      feedback reports. However, there are cases where it is not recommended
      to forward feedback reports, and this may allow feedback implosion. This
      memo discusses these cases and defines a new RTCP third-party loss
      report that can be used to inform receivers that the feedback target is
      aware of some loss event, allowing them to suppress feedback. Associated
      SDP signalling is also defined.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>RTCP feedback messages <xref target="RFC4585"></xref> allow the
      receivers in an RTP session to report events and ask for action from the
      media source (or a delegated feedback target when using unicast RTCP
      feedback with SSM <xref target="RFC5760"></xref>). There are cases where
      multiple receivers may initiate the same, or an equivalent message
      towards the same media source or the same feedback target. When the
      receiver count is large, this behavior may cause transient overload of
      the media source, the network or both. This is known as a "feedback
      storm" or a "NACK storm". One common cause of such a feedback storm is
      receivers utilizing RTP retransmission <xref target="RFC4588"></xref> as
      a packet loss recovery technique, sending feedback using RTCP NACK
      messages <xref target="RFC4585"></xref> without proper dithering of the
      retransmission requests (e.g., not implementing the RFC 4585 dithering
      rules or sending NACKs to a feedback target that doesn't redistribute
      them to other receivers).</t>

      <t>Another use case involves video Fast Update requests. A storm of
      these feedback messages can occur in conversational multimedia scenarios
      like multipoint video switching conference <xref
      target="RFC4587"></xref>. In this scenario, the receiver may lose
      synchronization with the video stream when speaker is changed in the
      middle of session. Poorly designed receivers that blindly issue fast
      update requests (i.e., Full Intra Request (FIR) described in <xref
      target="RFC5104">RFC5104</xref>), can cause an implosion of FIR requests
      from receivers to the same media source.</t>

      <t>RTCP feedback storms may cause short term overload, and in extreme
      cases to pose a possible risk of increasing network congestion on the
      control channel (e.g. RTCP feedback), the data channel, or both. It is
      therefore desirable to provide a way of suppressing unneeded feedback.
      This document specifies a new third-party loss report for this function.
      It supplements the existing the use of RTCP NACK packet and further is
      more precise in the uses where the network is active to suppress
      feedback. It tells receivers explicitly that feedback for a particular
      packet or frame loss is not needed for a period of time and can provide
      an early indication before the receiver reacts to the loss and invokes
      its packet loss repair machinery. <xref target="Use"></xref> provides
      some examples of when to send the Third Party Loss Report message.</t>

    <section title="Protocol Overview">
      <t>This document extends the RTCP feedback messages defined in the
      RTP/AVPF <xref target="RFC4585"></xref> defining a RTCP Third Party Loss
      Report (TPLR) message. The RTCP TPLR message can be used by the
      intermediaries to inform the receiver that the sender of the RTCP TPLR
      has received reports that the indicated packets were lost, and asks the
      receiver not to send feedback to it regarding these packets.
      Intermediaries are variously referred to as Distribution source,
      Burst/Retransmission Sources (BRS), MCUs, RTP translator, or RTP mixers,
      depending on the precise use case described <xref
      target="Use"></xref>.</t>

      <t> RTCP TPLR follows the similar format of message type as RTCP NACK or
      Full Intra Request Command. However, the RTCP TPLR is defined as an
      indication that the sender of the feedback has received reports that the
      indicated packets were lost, while NACK <xref target="RFC4585"></xref>
      just indicates that the sender of the NACK observed that these packets
      were lost. The RTCP TPLR message is generated by an intermediary that
      may not have seen the actual packet loss. It is sent following the same
      timing rule as sending NACK defined in <xref
      target="RFC4585">RFC4585</xref>. The RTCP TPLR message may be sent in a
      regular full compound RTCP packet or in an early RTCP packet, as per the
      RTP/AVPF rules. Intermediaries in the network that receive a RTCP TPLR
      SHOULD NOT send their own additional Third Party Loss Report messages
      for the same packet sequence numbers. They SHOULD simply forward the
      RTCP TPLR message received from upstream direction to the receiver(s),
      additionally, they may generate their own RTCP TPLR that reports a set
      of the losses they see, which are different from ones reported in the
      RTCP TPLR they received. The RTCP TPLR does not have the retransmission
      request <xref target="RFC4588"></xref> semantics. </t>

      <t>When a receiver gets a RTCP TPLR message, it MUST follow the rules
      for NACK suppression in RFC 4585 if the message is integrity protected
      and authenticated and refrain from sending a feedback request (e.g.,
      NACK or FIR) for the missing packets reported in the message,which is
      dealt with in the same way as receiving NACK.</t>

      <t>To increase the robustness to the loss of a TPLR, The RTCP TPLR may
      be retransmitted. If the additional TPLR arrives at receiver, the
      receiver SHOULD deal with the additional TPLR in the same way as
      receiving the first TPLR for the same packet and no additional behavior
      for receiver is required.</t>

      <t>A receiver may have sent a Feedback message according to the RTP/AVPF
      scheduling algorithm of <xref target="RFC4585">RFC4585</xref> before
      receiving a RTCP TPLR message, but further feedback messages for those
      sequence numbers SHOULD be suppressed for a period of time after
      receiving the RTCP TPLR. Nodes that do not understand the RTCP TPLR
      message will ignore it, and might therefore still send feedback
      according to the AVPF scheduling algorithm of <xref
      target="RFC4585">RFC4585</xref>. The media source or intermediate nodes
      cannot be certain that the use of a RTCP TPLR message actually reduces
      the amount of feedback it receives.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec4" title="Format of RTCP Feedback Messages">
      <t>This document introduces two new RTCP Feedback messages for Third
      Party Loss Report. Applications that are employing one or more loss-
      repair methods MAY use the RTCP TPLR together with their existing
      loss-repair methods either for every packet they expect to receive, or
      for an application-specific subset of the RTP packets in a session. In
      other words, receivers MAY ignore RTCP TPLR messages, but SHOULD react
      to them unless they have good reason to still send feedback messages
      despite having been requested to suppress them.</t>

      <t>The following two sections each define a RTCP TPLR message. Both
      messages are feedback messages as defined in section 6.1 of <xref
      target="RFC4585">RFC4585</xref>, and use the header format defined
      there. Each section defines how to populate the PT, FMT,length SSRC of
      packet sender, SSRC of media source, and FCI fields in that header. </t>

      <section title="Transport Layer Feedback:  Third Party Loss Report (TPLR)">
        <t>This TPLR message is identified by RTCP packet type value PT=RTPFB
        and FMT=TBA1. </t>

        <t>Within the common packet header for feedback messages (as defined
        in section 6.1 of <xref target="RFC4585">RFC4585</xref>), the "SSRC of
        packet sender" field indicates the source of the request, and the
        "SSRC of media source" denotes the media sender of the flow for which
        the indicated losses are being suppressed.</t>

        <t>The Feedback Control Information (FCI) field MUST contain one or
        more entries of transport layer third party loss Early Indication
        (TLLEI). Each entry applies to the same media source identified by the
        SSRC contained in the SSRC of media source field of Feedback header.
        The length field in the TLLEI feedback message MUST be set to 2+1*N,
        where N is the number of FCI entries.</t>

        <t>The FCI field for TLLEI uses the similar format of message Types
        defined in the section 6.2.1 of <xref target="RFC4585">RFC4585</xref>.
        The format is shown in <xref target="fig2"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="Use" title="Example Use Cases">
      <t>The operation of feedback suppression is similar for all types of RTP
      sessions and topologies <xref target="RFC5117"></xref>, however the
      exact messages used and the scenarios in which suppression is employed
      differ for various use cases. The following sections outline some of the
      intended use cases for using the Third Party Loss Report for feedback
      suppression and give an overview of the particular mechanisms.</t>

      <section title="Source Specific Multicast (SSM) use case">
        <t>In SSM RTP sessions as described in "RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
        Extensions for Single-Source Multicast Sessions with Unicast Feedback"
        <xref target="RFC5760"></xref>, one or more Media Sources send RTP
        packets to a Distribution Source. The Distribution Source relays the
        RTP packets to the receivers using a source- specific multicast
        group.</t>

        <t>As outlined in the <xref target="RFC5760">RFC5760</xref>, there are
        two Unicast Feedback models that may be used for reporting, the Simple
        Feedback model and the Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model. In
        the simple Feedback Model, there's no need for distribution source to
        create the RTCP TPLRs, instead, RTCP NACKs are reflected by the
        distribution source to the other Receivers. However in the
        Distribution Source Feedback Summary model, the distribution source
        will not redistribute the NACK for some reason(e.g., to prevent
        revealing the identity or existence of a system sending NACK)and may
        send a RTCP TPLR message to the systems that were unable to receive
        the NACK, and won't receive the NACK via other means. The RTCP TPLR
        can be generated at the distribution source when downstream loss is
        reported (e.g., downstream loss report is received), which indicates
        to the receivers that they should not transmit feedback messages for
        the same loss event for a certain time. Therefore the distribution
        source in the feedback summary model can be reasonably certain that it
        will help the situation (i.e., unable receive the NACK) by sending
        this RTCP TPLR message to all the relevant receivers impacted by the
        packet loss. </t>

      <section title="Unicast based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast Stream (RAMS) use case">
        <t>The typical RAMS architecture <xref target="RFC6285"></xref> may
        have several Burst/ Retransmission Sources(BRS) behind the multicast
        source (MS) placed at the same level. These BRSes will receive the
        primary multicast RTP stream from the media source and cache most
        recent packets after joining multicast session. If packet loss happens
        at the upstream of all the BRSs or the downstream of BRSes. One of the
        BRSes or all the BRSes may send a RTCP NACK or RTCP TPLR message to
        the DS, where the SSRC in this RTCP NACK or RTCP TPLR message is the
        BRS that is sending the message. The DS forwards/reflects this message
        down on the primary SSM. The details on how DS deal with this message
        is specified in <xref target="RETRANSMISSION-FOR-SSM"></xref>.</t>

        multicast to unicast for domains that do not support multicast. The
        translator may suffer a loss of important video packets. In this case,
        the translator may forward RTCP TPLR message received from upstream in
        the same way as forwarding other RTCP traffic. If the translator
        acting as the monitor <xref target="MONARCH"></xref> is aware of
        packet loss, it may use the SSRC of monitor as packet sender SSRC to
        create NACK message and send it to the receivers that are not aware of
        packet loss.</t>

      <section title="Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) use case">
        <t>When the speaker is changed in a voice-activated multipoint video
        switching conference <xref target="RFC4587"></xref>, an RTP mixer can
        be used to select the available input streams and forward them to each
        participants. If the MCU is doing a blind switch without waiting for a
        synchronization point on the new stream it can send a FIR to the new
        video source. In this case the MCU should send a FIR suppression
        message to the new receivers. e.g., when the RTP Mixer starts to
        receive FIR from some participants it can suppress the remaining
        session participants from sending FIR by sending out a RTCP TPLR
        message.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Mixer use case">
        <t>A Mixer, in accordance with <xref target="RFC5117">RFC5117</xref>,
        aggregates multiple RTP streams from other session participants and
        generates a new RTP stream sent to the session participants. In some
        cases, the video frames may get badly screwed up between media source
        and the mixer. In such case, the mixer need to check if the packet
        loss will result in PLI or FIR transmissions from most of the group by
        analyzing the received video. If so the mixer may initiate FIR or PLI
        towards the media source on behalf of all the session participants and
        send out a RTCP TPLR message to these session participants that may or
        are expected to send a PLI or FIR. Alternatively, when the mixer
        starts to receive FIR or PLI from some participants and like to
        suppress the remaining session participants from sending FIR or PLI by
        forwarding the FIR/PLI from one session participant to others.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The defined messages have certain properties that have security
      implications. These must be addressed and taken into account by users of
      this protocol.</t>

      <t>Spoofed or maliciously created feedback messages of the type defined
      in this specification can have the following implications:</t>

      <t>Sending the spurious Third Party Loss Report packet(e.g., the RTCP
      TPLR with the wrong sequence number of lost packet) that causes missing
      RTP packets to not be repaired in a timely fashion. If a receiver
      accepts such unauthenticated packet, an attacker could cause packet loss
      disrupting an important part of a session, preemptively sending feedback
      suppression. An attacker that is also a receiver has enough information
      to suppress all the feedbacks from any other listeners that don't accept
      unauthenticated packets. </t>

      <t>To prevent these attacks, there is a need to apply authentication and
      integrity protection of the feedback messages. This can be accomplished
      against threats external to the current RTP session using the RTP
      profile that combines Secure RTP <xref target="RFC3711"></xref> and AVPF
      into SAVPF <xref target="RFC5124"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Note that intermediaries that are not visible at the RTP layer that
      wish to send the Third Party Loss Reports on behalf of the media source
      can only do so if they spoof the SSRC of the media source. This is
      difficult in case SRTP is in use. If the intermediary is visible at the
      RTP layer, this is not an issue, provided the intermediary is part of
      the security context for the session.</t>

      <t>Also note that endpoints that receive a Third Party Loss Report would
      be well-advised to ignore it, unless the security is in place to
      authenticate the sender of the Third Party Loss Report. Accepting Third
      Party Loss Report from un-authenticated sender can lead to a denial of
      service attack, where the endpoint accepts poor quality media that could
      be repaired.</t>
