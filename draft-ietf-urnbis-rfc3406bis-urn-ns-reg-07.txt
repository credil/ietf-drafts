Internet-Draft               URN Namespaces                November 2013


1.  Introduction

   A Uniform Resource Name (URN) [I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn] is a
   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] that is intended to serve
   as a persistent, location-independent resource identifier.  This
   document supplements the Uniform Resource Name (URN) syntax
   specification [I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn] by defining:

   o  The concept of a URN namespace.

   o  A mechanism for defining a URN namespace and associating it with a
      public identifier (called a Namespace ID or "NID").

   o  Procedures for registering NIDs with the Internet Assigned Numbers
      Authority (IANA).

   Syntactically, the NID follows the 'urn' scheme name.  For instance,
   a URN in the 'example' namespace [RFC6963] might be of the form
   "urn:example:foo".

   This document rests on two key assumptions:

   1.  Assignment of a URN is a managed process.

       A string that conforms to the URN syntax is not necessarily a
       valid URN, because a URN needs to be assigned according to the
       rules of a particular namespace (in terms of syntax, semantics,
       and process).

   2.  The space of URN namespaces is itself managed.

       A string in the namespace identifier slot of the URN syntax is
       not necessarily a valid URN namespace identifier, because in
       order to be valid a namespace needs to be defined and registered
       in accordance with the rules of this document.

   URN namespaces were originally defined in [RFC2611], which was
   obsoleted by [RFC3406].  Based on experience with defining and
   registering URN namespaces since that time, this document specifies
   URN namespaces with the smallest reasonable set of changes from
   [RFC3406], while at the same time simplifying the registration
   process.  This document obsoletes RFC 3406.


2.  Terminology

   Several important terms used in this document are defined in the URN
   syntax specification [I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  What is a URN Namespace?

   A URN namespace is a collection of identifiers that are (1) unique,
   (2) assigned in a consistent way, and (3) assigned according to a
   common definition.

   1.  The "uniqueness" constraint means that an identifier within the
       namespace is never assigned to more than one resource and never
       reassigned to a different resource.

   2.  The "consistent assignment" constraint means that an identifier
       within the namespace is assigned by an organization or minted in
       accordance with a process or algorithm that is always followed.

   3.  The "common definition" constraint means that there are clear
       definitions for the syntax of identifiers within the namespace
       and the process of assigning or minting them.

   A URN namespace is identified by a particular NID in order to ensure
   the global uniqueness of URNs and, optionally, to provide a cue
   regarding the structure of URNs assigned within a namespace.

   With regard to global uniqueness, using different NIDs for different
   collections of identifiers ensures that no two URNs will be the same
   for different resources, since each collection is required to
   uniquely assign each identifier.  However, a single resource can have
   more than one URN assigned to it for different purposes (e.g., some
   numbers might be valid identifiers in two different identifier
   systems, where the namespace identifier differentiates between the
   resulting URNs).

   With regard to the structure of URNs assigned within a namespace, the
   development of an identifier structure (and thereby a collection of
   identifiers) depends on the requirements of the community defining
   the identifiers, how the identifiers will be assigned and used, etc.
   These issues are beyond the scope of URN syntax and the general rules
   for URN namespaces, because they are specific to the community
   defining a namespace (e.g., the bibliographic and publishing
   communities in the case of the 'ISBN' and 'ISSN' namespaces, or the
   developers of extensions to the Extensible Messaging and Presence
   Protocol in the case of the 'XMPP' namespace).

   URN namespaces inherit certain rights and responsibilities, e.g.:

   o  They uphold the general principles of a well-managed URN namespace
      by providing persistent identification of resources and unique
      assignment of identifier strings.
   o  They can be registered in global registration services.


4.  URN Namespace Types

   There are two types of URN namespace: formal and informal.  These are
   distinguished by the expected level of service, the information
   needed to define the namespace, and the procedures for registration.
   Because the majority of the namespaces registered so far have been
   formal, this document concentrates on formal namespaces.

   Note: [RFC3406] defined a third type of "experimental namespaces",
   denoted by prefixing the namespace identifier with the string "X-".
   Consistent with [RFC6648], this specification removes the
   experimental category.

4.1.  Formal Namespaces

   A formal namespace provides benefit to some subset of users on the
   Internet (i.e., not limited to users in communities or networks not
   connected to the Internet).  For example, it would be inappropriate
   for a NID to effectively force someone to use a proprietary network
   or service not open to the general Internet user.  The intent is
   that, while the community of those who might actively use the names
   assigned within that NID might be small, the potential use of
   identifiers within that NID is open to any user on the Internet.
   Formal NIDs might be appropriate when some aspects are not fully
   open.  For example, a namespace might make use of a fee-based,
   privately managed, or proprietary registry for assignment of URNs in
   the namespace.  However, it might still benefit some Internet users
   if the associated services have openly-published access protocols.

   An organization that will assign URNs within a formal namespace ought
   to meet the following criteria:

   o  Organizational stability and the ability to maintain the URN
      namespace for a long time; absent such evidence, it ought to be
      clear how the namespace can remain viable if the organization can
      no longer maintain the namespace.
   o  Competency in name assignment.  This will improve the likelihood
      of persistence (e.g. to minimize the likelihood of conflicts).

Internet-Draft               URN Namespaces                November 2013


   o  Commitment to not reassigning existing names and to allowing old
      names to continue to be valid, even if the owners or assignees of
      those names are no longer members or customers of that
      organization.  With regard to URN resolution [RFC2276], this does
      not mean that there needs to be resolution of such names, only
      that the names will not resolve to false or stale information.

   A formal namespace establishes a particular NID, subject to the
   following constraints (above and beyond the syntax rules specified in
   [I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn]):

   o  It MUST NOT be an already-registered NID.
   o  It MUST NOT start with "urn-" (which is reserved for informal
      namespaces).
   o  It MUST be more than two characters long.
   o  It MUST NOT start with "XY-", where "XY" is any combination of two
      ASCII letters.

   All two-letter combinations, and all two-letter combinations followed
   by "-" and any sequence of valid NID characters, are reserved for
   potential use as countrycode-based NIDs for eventual national
   registrations of URN namespaces.  The definition and scoping of rules
   for allocation of responsibility for such countrycode-based
   namespaces is beyond the scope of this document.

4.2.  Informal Namespaces

   Informal namespaces are full-fledged URN namespaces, with all the
   associated rights and responsibilities.  Informal namespaces differ
   from formal namespaces in the process for assigning a NID: IANA will
   assign an alphanumeric NID (e.g., "urn-7") to informal namespaces,
   with the following syntax:

       "urn-" <number>

   The only restrictions on <number> are that it (1) consist strictly of
   ASCII digits and (2) not cause the NID to exceed the length
   limitations defined in the URN syntax specification
   [I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn].


5.  Defining a URN Namespace

   The definition of a formal namespace ought to pay particular
   attention to:

Internet-Draft               URN Namespaces                November 2013


   o  The purpose of the namespace.
   o  The syntax of URNs assigned within the namespace.
   o  The process for assigning URNs within the namespace.
   o  The security implications of assigning and using the assigned
      URNs.
   o  Optionally, the process for resolving URNs issued within the
      namepace.

   The following sections explain these matters in greater detail.  For
   convenience, a template for defining and registering a URN namespace
   is provided under Section 6.  This information can be especially
   helpful to entities that wish to request assignment of a URN in a
   namespace and to entities that wish to provide URN resolution for a
   namespace.

5.1.  Purpose

   The "Purpose" section of the template describes matters such as:

   o  The kinds of resources identified by URNs assigned within the
      namespace.

   o  Why it is preferable to use URNs rather than some other technology
      (e.g., URIs) and why existing URN namespace (if any) are not a
      good fit.

   o  The kinds of software applications that can use or resolve the
      assigned URNs (e.g., by differentiating among disparate
      namespaces, identifying resources in a persistent fashion, or
      meaningfully resolving and accessing services associated with the
      namespace).

   o  The scope of the namespace (public vs. private, global vs. local
      to a particular organization, nation, or industry).  For example,
      a namespace claiming to deal in "social security numbers" ought to
      have a global scope and address all social security number
      structures, whereas a URN scheme for a particular national system
      would need to handle only that nation's social security numbers.

   o  How the intended community (and the Internet community at large)
      will benefit from using or resolving the assigned URNs.

5.2.  Syntax

   The "Syntax" section of the template describes:






Saint-Andre               Expires May 17, 2014                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               URN Namespaces                November 2013


   o  A description of the structure of URNs within the namespace, in
      conformance with the fundamental URN syntax
      [I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn].  The structure might be
      described in terms of a formal definition (e.g., using Augmented
      BNF for Syntax Specifications (ABNF) as specified in [RFC5234]),
      an algorithm for generating conformant URNs, a regular expression
      for parsing the identifier into components, or by explaining that
      the structure is opaque.

   o  Any special character encoding rules for assigned URNs (e.g.,
      which character ought to always be used for single-quotes).

   o  Rules for determining equivalence between two identifiers in the
      namespace.  Such rules ought to always have the effect of
      eliminating false negatives that might otherwise result from
      comparison.  If it is appropriate and helpful, reference can be
      made to the equivalence rules defined in the URI specification
      [RFC3986].  Examples of equivalence rules include equivalence
      between uppercase and lowercase characters in the Namespace
      Specific String, between hyphenated and non-hyphenated groupings
      in the identifier string, or between single-quotes and double-
      quotes.  (Note that these are not normative statements for any
      kind of best practice related to handling of equivalences between
      characters in general; they are statements limited to this
      specific namespace only.)

   o  Any special considerations necessary for conforming with the URN
      syntax.  This is particularly applicable in the case of legacy
      naming systems that are used in the context of URNs.  For example,
      if a namespace is used in contexts other than URNs, it might make
      use of characters that are reserved in the URN syntax.  This
      section ought to note any such characters, and outline necessary
      mappings to conform to URN syntax.  Normally, this will be handled
      by percent-encoding the character as specified in the URI
      specification [RFC3986].

5.3.  Assignment

   The "Assignment" section of the template describes matters such as:

   o  Mechanisms or authorities for assigning URNs to resources.  It
      ought to make clear whether assignment is completely open (e.g.,
      following a particular algorithm), completely closed (e.g., for a
      private organization), or limited in various ways (e.g., delegated
      to authorities recognized by a particular organization); if
      limited, it ought to explain how to become an assigner of
      identifiers or how to request assignemtn of identifers from
      existing assignment authorities.

Internet-Draft               URN Namespaces                November 2013


   o  Methods for ensuring that URNs within the namespace are unique.
      For example, identifiers might be assigned sequentially or in
      accordance with some well-defined process by a single authority,
      assignment might be partitioned among delegated authorities that
      are individually responsible for respecting uniqueness rules, or
      URNs might be minted independently following an algorithm that
      itself guarantees uniqueness.

   o  Methods for ensuring the longevity and maintainability of the
      namespace and URNs assigned with the namespace.  Although non-
      reassignment of URNs ensures that a URN will persist in
      identifying a particular resource even after the "lifetime of the
      resource" or the assignment authority, some consideration ought to
      be given to the persistence of the usability of the URN.  This is
      particularly important in the case of URN namespaces providing
      global resolution.

5.4.  Security

   The "Security" section of the template describes any potential
   security-related issues with regard to assignment, use, and
   resolution of identifiers within the namespace.  Examples of such
   issues include the consequences of producing false negatives and
   false positives during comparison for equivalence (see also
   [RFC6943]), leakage of private information when identifiers are
   communicated on the public Internet, the potential for directory
   harvesting, and various issues discussed in the guidelines for
   security considerations in RFCs [RFC3552].

5.5.  Resolution

   The "Resolution" section specifies the rules for resolution of URNs
   assigned within the namespace.  If such URNs are intended to be
   resolvable, the namespace needs to be registered in a Resolution
   Discovery System (RDS, see [RFC2276]) such as DDDS.  Resolution then
   proceeds according to standard URI resolution processes, as well as
   the mechanisms of the RDS.  This section ought to lists the
   requirements for becoming a recognized resolver of URNs in the
   relevant namespace (and being so listed in the RDS registry).
   Answers might include, but are not limited to:

   o  The namespace is not listed with an RDS; therefore this section is
      not applicable.
   o  Resolution mirroring is completely open, with a mechanism for
      updating an appropriate RDS.
   o  Resolution is controlled by entities to which assignment has been
      delegated.

7.  Registering a URN Namespace

7.1.  Formal Namespaces

   The registration policy for formal namespaces is Expert Review as
   defined in the "IANA Considerations" document [RFC5226].  The key
   steps for registration of a formal namespace are:

   1.  Fill out the namespace registration template (see Section 6).
       This can be done as part of an Internet-Draft or a specification
       in another series, although that is not necessary.
   2.  Send the completed template to the urn-nid@ietf.org discussion
       list for technical review.
   3.  If necessary to address comments received, repeat steps 1 and 2.
   4.  If the designated experts approve the request, the IANA will
       register the requested NID.

   A formal namespace registration can be revised by updating the
   registration template, following the same steps outlined above for
   new registrations.

7.2.  Informal Namespaces

   The registration policy for informal namespaces is First Come First
   Served [RFC5226].  The key steps for registration of an informal
   namespace are:

   1.  Write a completed namespace definition template (see Section 6).
   2.  Send it to the urn-nid@ietf.org discussion list for feedback.
   3.  Once the review period has expired, send the final template to
       IANA (via the iana@iana.org email address).

   An informal namespace registration can be revised by updating the
   registration template, following the same steps outlined above for
   new registrations.


8.  Guidelines for Designated Experts

   Experience to date with NID registration requests has shown that
   registrants sometimes do not initially understand some of the
   subtleties of URN namespaces, and that defining the namespace in the
   form of a specification enables the registrants to clearly formulate
   their "contract" with the intended user community.  Therefore,
   although the registration policy for formal namespaces is Expert
   Review and a specification is not required, the designated experts
   for NID registration requests are encouraged to prefer that a
   specification exist documenting the namespace definition.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document outlines the processes for registering URN namespaces,
   and has implications for the IANA in terms of registries to be
   maintained.  In all cases, the IANA ought to assign the appropriate
   NID (formal or informal) once the procedures outlined in this
   document have been completed.


10.  Security Considerations

   This document largely focuses on providing mechanisms for the
   declaration of public information.  Nominally, these declarations
   will be of relatively low security profile, however there is always
   the danger of "spoofing" and providing misinformation.  Information
   in these declarations ought to be taken as advisory.

   The definition of a URN namespace needs to account for potential
   security issues related to assignment, use, and resolution of
   identifiers within the namespace.

Appendix A.  Changes from RFC 3406

   This document makes the following substantive changes from [RFC3406]:

   o  Relaxes the registration policy for formal namespaces from "IETF
      Review" to "Expert Review" [RFC5226].
   o  Removes the category of experimental namespaces, consistent with
      [RFC6648].
   o  Simplifies the registration template.

   In addition, some of the text has been updated to be consistent with
   the definition of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) [RFC3986] and
   the processes for registering information with the IANA [RFC5226], as
   well as more modern guidance with regard to security issues [RFC3552]
   and identifier comparison [RFC6943].
