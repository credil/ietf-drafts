   encapsulation.This solution can be used in any scenarios describe in
   [RFC6144].

   The approach described in this draft is fully compatible with
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format].

   Define an IPv4 Prefix assigned by a Service Provider for a IPv4/IPv6
   Multicast Address Conversion rule.

   Rule_IPv4_Offset:

   Define an offset where IPv4 Multicast Address should embedded in the
   IPv6 Multicast Address.

   Rule_IPv4_Type:

   Defined whether an IPv4 Multicast Address Suffix or a full IPv4
   Multicast Address is embedded in the IPv6 Multicast Address.  Value 0
   is default and means IPv4 Multicast Address Suffix is embedded in the
   IPv6 Multicast Address.  Value 1 means a full IPv4 Multicast Address
   is embedded in the IPv6 Multicast Address.

3.  Architecture

   All of the scenarios that are describe in [RFC6144] can be easily
   illustrate using the diagram show in Figure 1 below:


                             ====>
                  --------
                //        \\       -----------

                            <====


                  Figure 1: IPv4-IPv6 Address Conversion

   As shown in this diagram(Fig.1), there is a conversion node between
   an IPv4 Multicast System and IPv6 Multicast System.  Every conversion
   node must be provisioned with at least one rule defined in the
   document used for IPv4/IPv6 Multicast Address Conversion.  There are
   also two arrows: an arrow from IPv4 Multicast system to IPv6
   Multicast System means IPv4 Multicast system initiates the multicast
   flow.  Another arrow from IPv6 Multicast system to IPv4 Multicast
   System means IPv6 Multicast system initiates the multicast flow.  And

   this also means that the algorithmic described in this document
   support both IPv4-initiated communication and IPv6-initiated
   communication.

4.  IPv4/IPv6 Multicast Address Conversion

   This section specifies the rule(s) for IPv4/IPv6 multicast address
   conversion.

4.1.  Rule Design

   Every CONV node must be provisioned with at least one rule.  When
   there are several rules for IPv4/IPv6 Conversion assigned for a CONV
   node, this node should choose the rule which is longest match prefix
   for the destination IP address in multicast flow.

   Each rule includes the following:

   Rule_IPv6_M_Prefix (including prefix length)

   Rule_IPv4_M_Prefix (including prefix length, optional)

   Rule_IPv4_Offset (optional)

   Rule_IPv4_Type (optional)

   Rule_IPv6_M_Prefix/Length is according to section 2.7 of
   [ADDRARCH][RFC3513],or based on [RFC3306].This parameter is
   mandatory.

   Rule_IPv4_M_Prefix/Length is in IPv4 multicast group address scope.
   By default, this parameter is empty, which means match any IPv4 group
   address in the destination address field in the receiving packet.
   This parameter is optional.

   Rule_IPv4_Offset defines the offset where IPv4 multicast address is
   embedded in the IPv6 multicast address.  By default, the value is
   96,which means embedded the IPv4 multicast address in the last 32
   bits of the IPv6 multicast address.  This parameter is optional.

   Rule_IPv4_Type defines two kinds of IPv6 Multicast Address format:
   one format is IPv4 Multicast Address Suffix is embedded in the IPv6
   Multicast Address, and corresponding Rule_IPv4_Type value is 0;
   another format is Full IPv4 Multicast Address is embedded in the IPv6
   Multicast Address, and corresponding Rule_IPv4_Type value is 1.By
   default, Rule_IPv4_Type value is 0.  This parameter is optional.

Internet-DrafIPv4-IPv6 Multicast Address Dynamic Conversion    July 2013


   When Rule_IPv6_M_Prefix is SSM mode, the corresponding
   Rule_IPv4_M_Prefix in the same rule should be SSM mode.  When
   Rule_IPv6_M_Prefix is ASM mode, the corresponding Rule_IPv4_M_Prefix
   in the same rule should be ASM mode.

   If Rule_IPv6_M_Prefix is ASM mode but the corresponding
   Rule_IPv4_M_Prefix is SSM mode, the CONV node should process this
   rule as invalid.  Also, if Rule_IPv6_M_Prefix is SSM mode but the
   corresponding Rule_IPv4_M_Prefix is ASM mode, the CONV node should
   process this rule as invalid.

4.2.  IPv4 Multicast Address Suffix-embedded IPv6 Multicast Address

   When Rule_IPv4_Type value is 0, the concentrated IPv6 Multicast
   Address format is as follow:


       |     n bits           |  o bits   | m-n-o bits  |        128-m bits     |
       +----------------------+-----------+-------------+-----------------------+
       |  Rule_IPv6_M_Prefix  |  0x00     |IPv4_M_Suffix|          0x00         |
       +----------------------+-----------+-------------+-----------------------+
       |<-------------------  IPv6 Multicast Address   -------------------- --->|


       Figure 2: IPv6 Multicast Address Format for Rule_IPv4_Type=0

   The IPv6 Multicast Address is created by combining the
   Rule_IPv6_M_Prefix and IPv4_M_Suffix and all zeros.  Where the
   IPv4_M_Suffix is embedded is dependent with the
   Rule_IPv4_Offset(m).From the above format, with the
   Rule_IPv4_Offset(m), can induce the embedded position of the
   IPv4_M_Suffix.  Then can concentrate the IPv6 Multicast Address as
   above.  The IPv4_M_Suffix illustrates as follow:

        |       r bits       |        p bits       |
        +--------------------+---------------------+
        |Rule_IPv4_M_Prefix  |   IPv4_M_Suffix     |
        +--------------------+---------------------+
        |  32 bits  IPv4 Destination Address       |

                                 Figure 3

   If Rule_IPv4_Offset value is 0, puts the IPv4_M_Suffix in the last
   (32-r) bits in the 128-bits IPv6 Multicast Address.

4.3.  Full IPv4 Multicast Address-embedded IPv6 Multicast Address

Internet-DrafIPv4-IPv6 Multicast Address Dynamic Conversion    July 2013


   When Rule_IPv4_Type value is 1, the concentrated IPv6 Multicast
   Address format is as follow:

    |     n bits           |  o bits   |   32 bits     |        128-m bits     |
    +----------------------+-----------+---------------+-----------------------+
    |  Rule_IPv6_M_Prefix  |  0x00     |Full IPv4 M Add|          0x00         |
    +----------------------+-----------+---------------+-----------------------+
    |<-------------------  IPv6 Multicast Address   -------------------------->|

       Figure 4: IPv6 Multicast Address Format for Rule_IPv4_Type=1

   The IPv6 Multicast Address is created by combining the
   Rule_IPv6_M_Prefix and Full IPv4 Destination Address and all zeros.
   Where the Full IPv4 Destination Address is embedded is dependent with
   the Rule_IPv4_Offset(m).From the above format, with the
   Rule_IPv4_Offset(m), can induce the embedded position of the Full
   IPv4 Destination Address.  Then can concentrate the IPv6 Multicast
   Address as above.  The Full IPv4 Destination Address is the
   destination IPv4 address in the multicast flow.

5.  Forwarding

5.1.  From IPv4 Multicast System to IPv6 Multicast System

   When a CONV node receives IPv4 multicast flow from IPv4 Multicast
   System, the CONV node should check whether there is a
   Rule_IPv4_M_Prefix longest match with the destination IPv4 multicast
   address.  If there is no such rule which has a longest match prefix,
   the CONV node should drop these IPv4 multicast flow.  If there is a
   rule which has a longest match prefix with the destination IPv4
   multicast address, then do the IPv4-IPv6 conversion according to this
   rule.  And then derive the IPv6 multicast address.  The CONV node
   then checks the IPv6 multicast routing table ,finds the outgoing
   interface and forwards the IPv6 multicast flow into the IPv6
   Multicast System.

5.2.  From IPv6 Multicast System to IPv6 Multicast System

   When a CONV node receives IPv6 multicast flow from IPv6 Multicast
   System, the CONV node should check whether there is a
   Rule_IPv6_M_Prefix longest match with the destination IPv6 multicast
   address.  If there is no such rule which has a longest match prefix,
   the CONV node should drop these IPv6 multicast flow.  If there is a
   rule which has a longest match prefix with the destination IPv6
   multicast address, then do the IPv4-IPv6 conversion according to this
   rule.  If the Rule_IPv4_Type value is 0, then derives the
   IPv4_M_Suffix from the destination IPv6 address at the
   Rule_IPv4_Offset, concentrates the Rule_IPv4_M_Prefix with the

Internet-DrafIPv4-IPv6 Multicast Address Dynamic Conversion    July 2013


   IPv4_M_Suffix as the destination IPv4 multicast address.  If the
   Rule_IPv4_Type value is 1, then derives the destination IPv4 address
   from the destination IPv6 address at the Rule_IPv4_Offset.  The CONV
   node then checks the IPv4 multicast routing table , finds the
   outgoing interface and forwards the IPv4 multicast flow into the IPv4
   Multicast System.

6.  Backwards compatibility

   This solution is fully compatible with the multicast address format
   in the "draft-ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format".

7.  Security Considerations

   To be added later on as-needed basis.
