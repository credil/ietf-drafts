                          BGP vector routing.
                draft-patel-raszuk-bgp-vector-routing-00

Abstract

   Network architectures have begun to shift from pure destination based
   routing to service aware routing.  Operator requirements in this
   space include forcing traffic through particular service nodes (e.g.
   firewall, NAT) or segments.  This document proposes an enhancement to
   BGP to accommodate these new requirements.

   This document proposes a pure control plane solution which allows
   traffic to be routed via an ordered set of transit points (links,
   nodes, or services) on the way to traffic's destination, with no
   change in the forwarding plane.  This approach is in contrast to
   other proposal in this space which provide similar capabilities via
   modifications to the forwarding plane.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document addresses two problems.  The first is traffic
   engineering - by providing specific paths over which traffic must
   flow, an operator can modify the traffic pattern on their network to
   better address congestion.  While typically this has been
   accomplished by constructing MPLS-TE LSPs and mapping traffic on
   them, the overhead of the MPLS control plane and the requirement to
   use the MPLS data plane can pose an operational issue for some
   service providers such as data center providers.  The emerging
   solution of segment routing simplifies the control plane but is
   limited to intra-domain topologies only.

   The second can be thought of as services engineering - by providing
   an ordered list of services nodes through which a particular
   destination's traffic must traverse, an operator can add services
   (e.g.  NATs, load balancers, firewalls) along the forwarding path
   towards a specific destination.  As services such as NAT, Firewalls
   and Load Balancers move to the cloud based model, a need to discover,
   prioritize and chain these services is needed.  The draft draft-
   keyupate-bgp-services-02 describes extensions to BGP that facilitates
   auto discovery of services within the network.  This draft proposes
   an extension to BGP that facilitates prioritizing and chaining of
   services within a network.  Since service chaining is facilitated
   using the BGP control plane, it can readily be applied to IP-only
   tunneling encapsulations for network virtualization such as VXLAN and
   NVGRE.

   In either case, this document refers to the use of the proposed BGP
   extension as Service Chaining.

   To facilitate Service Chaining, this document defines a new BGP
   attribute known as a BGP Vector Node attribute.  The BGP Vector Node
   attribute consist of an ordered list of IP transit hops that needs to
   be traversed before the packet is forwarded to its BGP NEXT HOP.  The
   information carried in the ordered list of Vector Node is used
   towards augmenting the NEXT HOP information for the BGP prefixes as
   carried in the MP_REACH attribute.  This draft specifies rules for
   BGP-speaking traffic forwarders (i.e. PEs and midpoint nodes) to
   replace the NEXT HOP information in their RIB/FIB with an
   intermediate node supplied by the BGP Vector Node attribute.

2.  Protocol Extensions

   This document describes a BGP attribute known as BGP Vector Node
   attribute, along with rules for identifying an intermediate next-hop
   from tthe BGP Vector Node attribute.

   The BGP Vector Node attribute is a new BGP optional transitive
   attribute.  The attribute type code for the Vector Node attribute is
   to be assigned by IANA.  The value field of the Vector Node attribute
   is defined as a set of one or more Vector Node TLVs.

   A Vector Node TLV within a Vector Node Attribute is defined as
   follows:




            0               1             2                 3

                         Figure1: Vector Node TLV

   TYPE: Two octets encoding the Vector Node TLV Type.  Type 1 and type
   2 are defined in this document.  Type 1 is defined as Segment Routing
   hop address.  Type 2 is defined as Service Chain node address.

   LENGTH: Two octets encoding the length in octets of the Vector Node
   TLV, including the type and length fields.  The Length is encoded as
   an unsigned binary integer.

   AFI: Address Family Identifier (16 bits).

   SAFI: Subsequent Address Family Identifier (8 bits).

   RESERVED: One octet reserved for special flags

   4 OCTET AS NUMBER: 4 octet AS number or zero padded 2 octet AS number
   of the autonomous system Vector Node Address belongs

   VECTOR NODE ADDRESS: The IP address of transit router or IP address
   of service appliance.

3.  Operation

   The BGP Vector Node attribute is used to augment prefix or set of
   prefixes carried in given BGP UPDATE message with set of nodes
   information which are intended to be used to influence computation of
   forwarding paths for those destinations.  The Vector Node attribute
   can be used within a provider's IBGP network and across EBGP
   networks.  The BGP Vector Node attribute is an optional transitive
   attribute that can be applied to any address family within BGP where
   there is need for routing the traffic through ordered list of transit
   nodes.

   The BGP Vector Node attribute consists of one more Vector Node TLVs.
   The ordered list of Vector Node TLVs indicates an ordered list of
   nodes that need to transit or process the data packets sent towards
   the destination prefix.  The creation of the list of Vector Nodes is
   outside the scope of this document, but is expected to be created
   either through a Command Line Interface (CLI) on a router, or using
   an orchestrator system or by some other automated SDN computing
   engines.

   The Vector Node attribute may be advertised by either an egress BGP
   speaker or injected by a non-egress node such as a BGP Route
   Reflector.  It must be noted that in the event of non egress
   injection (e.g. a route reflector) extra assurance must be taken to
   achieve routing consistency.

   Each BGP speaker which supports the BGP Vector Node attribute needs
   to process the attribute upon receipt and modify the NEXT HOP that
   node uses when installing the prefix in its local RIB/FIB.  The rules
   to modify the NEXT HOP using the Vector Node attribute are as
   follows:

   1 - Each BGP speaker involved in BGP Vector Routing only examines
   those TLVs which contains its own AS number.  In an event where the
   BGP Vector node attribute is missing or if no Vector Routing TLVs
   with an AS number matching to BGP speaker's AS is present (BGP
   speaker fails the AS check criteria), a BGP speaker MUST use as the
   NEXT HOP from the received BGP MP_REACH attribute or a BGP NEXT HOP
   attribute in absense of a MP_REACH attribute.

Internet-Draftdraft-patel-raszuk-bgp-vector-routing-00.txt     June 2013


   2 - In an event where the BGP speaker passes the AS check criteria
   for a given Vector TLV, a BGP speaker MUST use as the NEXT HOP of the
   prefix the first Node Address from the Vector Node Attribute TLVs if
   it does not find its own IGP node address (typically a loopback
   address) or if none of the Vector Node addresses belong to any of its
   connected interface subnets or are covered by any of the locally
   configured static routes when installing the route in its local RIB/
   FIB.

   3 - In an event where the BGP speaker passes the AS check criteria
   for a given Vector TLV and if a BGP speaker finds its IGP node
   address (typically a loopback address) as one of the Vector node
   address, or if a BGP speaker finds its connected address as one of
   the Vector node address, or if the Vector node address is covered by
   any of the locally configured static route, then it MUST use as a
   NEXT HOP the next eligible Vector Node address from the Vector Node
   TLVs when installing the route in the RIB/FIB.  In addition depending
   on the type of Vector Node TLV it may need to flag such a RIB/FIB
   entry with local punt or redirection for example to force Service
   Processing of type 2 Vector Node TLV.

   4 - In an event where the BGP speaker passes the AS check criteria
   for a given Vector TLV and if a BGP speaker finds its IGP node
   address (typically a loopback address) as one of the Vector node
   address, or if a BGP speaker finds its connected address as one of
   the Vector node address, or if the Vector node address is covered by
   any of the locally configured static route, and if the found Vector
   node address is the last address in the TLV, then the BGP speaker
   MUST use NEXT HOP as a NEXT HOP address from the received BGP
   MP_REACH attribute or a BGP NEXT HOP attribute in absense of a
   MP_REACH attribute.

   As an example, consider the following scenario where VM1 attached to
   NVE1 needs to communicate with H1 attached to PE1.  However, packets
   from VM1 to H1 need the services of S1 off of NVE3 and S2 off of NVE4
   respectively.  Therefore, the service chain of VM1 -> S1 -> S2 -> H1
   needs to be formed for packets from VM1 to H1.

                                       S1 VM5     S2




   Lets assume VM1, VM3, S1, S2, and H1 are part of the same VPN and a
   same Autonomous System.  PE1 advertises host route H1 with Vector
   Node Attribute of [I1, I2]; where I1 and I2 are interface subnet
   addresses corresponding to service nodes S1 and S2 respectively.

   When NVE1 or NVE2 receives this advertisement, it applies rule (2)
   and subsequently setting the next hop address of H1 to I1
   corresponding to service node S1.  Therefore, when it receives
   packets destined to H1, it encapsulates the packets using any
   existing tunneled mechanisms and forwards them to the I1 address in
   NVE3.

   When NVE3 receives this advertisement, it applies rule (3) by
   identifying its interface subnet I1 in the Vector Node attribute and
   subsequently setting the next hop address of H1 to I2 corresponding
   to service node S2.  Therefore, when it receives packets from the
   network it forwards them to S1 and when it receives packets from its
   attached service node S1, destined to H1, it encapsulates the packets
   using any existing tunneled mechanisms and forwards them to the I2
   address in NVE4.

   When NVE4 receives this advertisement, it applies rule (4) by
   identifying its interface subnet I2 in the Vector Node attribute and
   since it is the last address in the Vector Node attribute list, it
   sets the next hop address of PE1 (received in the BGP advertisement)
   as the Next Hop for the prefix.  Therefore when it receives packets
   from the network it forwards them to S2 when it receives packets
   destined to H1 from its attached service node S2, it encapsulates the
   packets using any existing tunneled mechanisms and forwards them to
   the PE1.

4.  Deployment considerations

   The BGP Vector Routing can be deployed for both Intra and Inter-
   domain networks without any restriction on version of IP address used
   as a Vector Node.

   When using BGP Vector Routing and BGP multipath feature it is
   mandatory to assure consistent imposition of BGP Vector Node
   Attribute for a given prefix or group of prefixes from any imposition
   point in the network.  When BGP speaker detects inconsistency across
   content of BGP Vector Routing Attribute across paths of the same
   prefix it is mandated to ignore such attribute and log a system
   warning.

   When using BGP Vector Routing marking from any points within the
   domain it is mandatory to assure consistency of application of BGP
   Vector Routing Attribuite in all injection points.

   Reachability to BGP Vector Routing Nodes is resolved in exactly same
   manner as a reachability to traditional BGP Next Hops are resolved
   with the help of IGP routing.  As such, BGP Vector Routing can use
   IGP Segment Routing rules to reach next BGP Vector Node.

   This specification for its deployment simplicity assumes that BGP
   Vector Routing must be used with some form of IGP encapsulation
   between ingress, egress and all transit or service nodes.  In
   particular IP encapsulation, MPLS encapsulation or Segment Routing
   can be used to transit packets within any IGP domain where BGP may
   not be present or BGP routers are not upgraded with new
   functionality.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP attribute known as a BGP Vector Node
   attribute.  The code point for a new BGP Vector Node attribute has to
   be assigned by IANA from the BGP Path Attributes registry.

6.  Security considerations

   No new security issues are introduced to the BGP protocol by this
   specification.
