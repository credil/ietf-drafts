Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks                  July 2012


1.  Introduction

   This draft defines two new block types to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The first new block type supports reporting of Initial
   Synchronization Delay to establish multimedia session.  Information
   is recorded about time difference between the start of RTP sessions
   and the time the RTP receiver acquires all components of RTP sessions
   in the multimedia session [RFC6051].

   The second new block type supports reporting of the relative
   synchronization offset time of two arbitrary streams (e.g., between
   audio and video streams), with the same RTCP CNAME included in RTCP
   SDES packets [RFC3550].  Information is recorded about the
   synchronization offset time of each RTP stream relative to the
   reference RTP stream with the same CNAME and General Synchronization
   Offset of zero.

   These metrics belong to the class of terminal related transport level
   metrics defined in [MONARCH].


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Initial Synchronization Delay:

      A multimedia session comprises a set of concurrent RTP sessions
      among a common group of participants, using one RTP session for
      each media type.  Initial synchronization Delay is the average
      time for receiver to synchronize the components of a multimedia
      session [RFC6051].

   Synchronization Offset:

      The absolute delay variance of the measured RTP stream relative to
      the reference RTP stream in the multimedia session.

3.  Applicability

   The report blocks defined in this document could be used by dedicated
   network monitoring applications.

   When joining each session in layered video sessions [RFC6190] or the
   multimedia session, a receiver may not synchronize playout across the
   multimedia session or layered video session until RTCP SR packets
   have been received on all of the component RTP sessions.  The
   component RTP session are referred to as each RTP session for each
   media type in multimedia session or separate RTP session for each
   layer in the layered video session.  For unicast session, the delay
   due to negotiation of NAT pinholes, firewall holes, quality-of-
   service, and media security keys is contributed to such initial
   synchronization playout.  For multicast session, such initial
   synchronization delay varies with the session bandwidth, the number
   of members, and the number of senders in the session.  The RTP flow
   Initial synchronization delay block can be used to report the initial
   synchronization delay to receive all the RTP streams belonging to the
   same multimedia session or layered video session.  In the absence of
   packet loss, the initial synchronization delay equals to the average
   time taken to receive the first RTCP packet in the RTP session with
   the longest RTCP reporting interval.  In the presence of packet loss,
   the media synchronization needs to based on the in-band mapping of
   RTP and NTP-format timestamps [RFC6051] or wait until the reporting
   interval has passed, and the next RTCP SR packet is sent.

   In an RTP multimedia session, there can be an arbitrary number of
   streams carried in different RTP sessions, with the same RTCP CNAME.
   These streams may be not synchronized with each other.  For example,
   one audio stream and one video stream belong to the same session and
   audio stream are transmitted lag behind video stream for multiple
   tens of milliseconds.  The RTP Flows Synchronization Offset block can
   be used to report such synchronization offset between video stream
   and audio stream.


4.  RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block

   This block is sent by RTP receivers and reports Initial
   synchronization delay beyond the information carried in the standard
   RTCP packet format.  Information is recorded about time difference
   between the start of RTP sessions and the time the RTP receiver
   acquires all components of RTP sessions [RFC6051].

4.1.  Metric Block Structure

   The RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block has the
   following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |    BT=RFISD   |   Reserved    |         Block length=2        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                      SSRC of Source                           |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

4.2.  Definition of Fields in RTP Flow Initial Synchronization Delay
      Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      The Statistics Summary Report Block is identified by the constant
      <RFISD>.

   Block length: 16 bits

      The constant 2, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      The SSRC of the media source SHALL be set to the value of the SSRC
      identifier carried in an arbitrary RTP stream belonging to the
      same multimedia session.

   Initial Synchronization Delay: 32 bits

      The average delay, expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds, from the
      RTCP packets received on all of the components RTP sessions to the
      beginning of session [RFC6051].  The value is calculated based on
      the information contained in RTCP SR packets or the in-band
      mapping of RTP and NTP-format timestamps [RFC6051].  If there is
      no packet loss, the initial synchronization delay is expected to
      be equal to the average time taken to receive the first RTCP
      packet in the RTP session with the longest RTCP reporting
      interval.

      If the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field with
      all bits set to 1 SHOULD be reported.

5.  RTP Flows Synchronization Offset Metrics Block

   In the RTP multimedia sessions, there can be an arbitrary number of
   streams and each stream (e.g., audio stream or video stream) is sent
   in a separate RTP stream.  The receiver associates RTP streams to be
   synchronized by means of RTCP CNAME contained in the RTCP Source
   Description (SDES) packets [RFC3550].

   This block is sent by RTP receivers and reports synchronization
   offset of the arbitrary two RTP streams that needs to be synchronized
   in the RTP multimedia session.  Information is recorded about the
   actual delay variance of the measured RTP stream relative to he
   reference RTP stream with the same CNAME.  The reference RTP stream
   can be chosen as the arbitrary stream with minimum delay according to
   the common criterion defined in section 6.2.2.1 of [Y.1540].

5.1.  Metric Block Structure

   The RTP Flow General Synchronization Offset Report Block has the
   following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |    BT=RFSO    |   Reserved    |         Block length=3        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                        SSRC of source                         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |         Synchronization Offset, most significant word         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |         Synchronization Offset, least significant word        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

5.2.  Definition of Fields in RTP Flow General Synchronization Offset
      Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      The RTP Flow General Synchronization Offset Report Block is
      identified by the constant <RFSO>.

   Block length: 16 bits

      The constant 3, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks                  July 2012


   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      The SSRC of the media source SHALL be set to the value of the SSRC
      identifier of the reference RTP stream to which the XR relates.

   Synchronization Offset: 64 bits

      The synchronization offset of one RTP stream relative to the
      reference RTP stream with the same CNAME.  The Synchronization
      Offset of the reference stream should be zero.  This value is
      calculated based on the interarrival time between an arbitrary RTP
      packet and the reference RTP packet with the same CNAME, and
      timestamps of this arbitrary RTP packet and the reference RTP
      packet with the same CNAME.  The value of this field is
      represented using a 64-bit NTP-format timestamp as defined in
      [RFC5905], which is 64-bit unsigned fixed-point number with the
      integer part in the first 32 bits and the fractional part in the
      last 32 bits.

      If the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field with
      all bits set to 1 SHOULD be reported.


6.  SDP Signaling

   Two new parameters are defined for the two report blocks defined in
   this document to be used with Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566] using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].
   They have the following syntax within the "rtcp-xr" attribute
   [RFC3611]:

               rtcp-xr-attrib =  "a=rtcp-xr:"
                                 [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF
               xr-format = RTP-flows-init-syn-delay
                         / RTP-flows-syn-offset
               RTP-flows-init-syn-delay = "RTP-flows-init-syn-delay"
                                          ["=" max-size]
               RTP-flow-syn-offset = "RTP-flows-syn-offset"
                                     ["=" max-size]
               max-size = 1*DIGIT ; maximum block size in octets

   Refer to Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for a detailed description
   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.
