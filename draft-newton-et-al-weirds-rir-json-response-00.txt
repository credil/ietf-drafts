1.  Introduction

   The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) have begun experimenting with
   RESTful web services for access to Whois data.
   draft-newton-et-al-weirds-rir-query presents uniform patterns which
   may be used to contruct URLs for accessing data from these RESTful
   web services.  This document describes responses in the JSON
   serialization format to the query URLs in
   draft-newton-et-al-weirds-rir-query.

   As this document describes responses returned in JSON format, other
   documents may describe responses in other formats to the same URL
   queries.

Internet-Draft         RIR RESTful JSON RESPONSES           January 2012


2.  Signalling for JSON

   To receive JSON responses, clients SHOULD put the "application/json"
   MIME type in the Accept header.  Servers SHOULD respond with JSON
   responses when this MIME type is present in the Accept header in
   accordance with the preference rules for the Accept header in HTTP,
   however the use of multiple MIME types in the Accept header is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.

3.  JSON Naming

   Clients processing JSON responses SHOULD ignore values associated
   with unrecognized names.  Servers MAY insert values signified by
   names into the JSON responses which are not specified in this
   document.  Insertion of unspecified values into JSON responses SHOULD
   have names prefixed with a short identifier followed by an underscore
   followed by a meaningful name.

   For example, "handle" is specified in this document as the name of a
   value which is a string containing an RIR unique identifier for a
   registration.  The RIR of the Moon might desire to insert a value
   specific to their services denoting that a registration occured
   before or after the first moon landing.  The name for such a value
   might take the form "lunarNic_beforeOneSmallStep".

   JSON names SHOULD NOT contain punctuation, whitespace, or other
   characters typically not allowed in variable names of modern
   programming languages.  This better enables clients to automatically
   promote JSON values to first order object attributes or members using
   the given JSON names.  Using the examples above, a Java or Ruby
   programmer working with such a framework may be able to reference the
   values as network.handle or network.lunarNic_beforeOneSmallStep.

   Clients processing JSON responses MUST be prepared for values
   specified in this document to be absent from a response as no JSON
   value listed in this document is required to appear in the response.
   In other words, servers MAY remove values as is needed by the
   policies of the server operator.

4.  Responses

   As specified in draft-newton-et-al-weirds-rir-query, queries for
   resources and information can be made for three types of information:
   1) information about IP networks, 2) information about autonomous
   system numbers, and 3) information about reverse DNS delegations.
   Queries for each of these three types can be constructed to target
   specific information:

   o  operator information (e.g. "/operator")

   o  contacts of the operator (e.g "/operator/contacts")

   o  specific types of contacts of the operator (e.g. "/operator/
      contacts/abuse")

   o  registration information about the networks, AS numbers, or DNS
      delegations (e.g. "/registration")

   o  all of the above (e.g. "/")

4.1.  IP Networks

   The following is an elided example of a JSON response object to a
   query for both registration and operator information of an IP network


   {
     "network":
     {
       ...
     },
     "operator":
     {
       ...
     }
   }


                                 Figure 1

   The "network" member, which may be queried for directly as the
   registration information (i.e. "/registration") of the IP network is
   described below.

   The following is an example of the JSON object for the network
   registration information


   {
     "handle" : "XXXX-RIR",
     "startAddress" : "10.0.0.0",
     "endAddress" : "10.0.0.255",

     "parentId" : "YYYY-RIR",

       "she sells seas shells",
       "down by the seashore"
     ],

     "lastChangedDate" : "20110509",
     "lastChangedBy" : "joe@bob.com"
   }


   The following is a description of the members of this object:

   handle  -- a string representing an RIR unique identifier of the
      network registration

   startAddress  -- the starting IP address of the network

   endAddress  -- the ending IP address of the network

   ipVersion  -- an integer signifying the IP protocol version of the
      network: 4 signifying an IPv4 network, 6 signifing an IPv6 network

   name  -- an identifier assigned to the network registration by the
      registration holder

   description  -- a string containing descriptive text about the
      network registration

   type  -- a string containing an RIR specific classification of the
      network

   parendId  -- a string containing an RIR unique identifier of the
      parent network of this network registration

   The members "remarks", "uris", "registrationDate", "lastChangedDate",
   and "lastChangedBy" take the same form of the members of the same
   name of the entity object (Section 5).

   The "operator" member of Figure 1, which maybe queried for directly
   using the "/operator" path, is described below.

   The following is an elided example of a JSON response object for
   operator information


   {
     "entity":
     {
       ...
     },
     "contacts":
     {
       "tech": [
         ...

   The "entity" member of Figure 2 is an object and is specified in
   Section 5.  The "contacts" member is an object containing three
   arrays: "tech", "admin", and "abuse".  Each of these arrays contains
   entities (Section 5).  That is, the "tech" array contains entity
   objects, each representing a tech contact, etc...

4.2.  Autonomous Systems

   An autonomous number query for both the registration and operator
   and/or contact information yields an object containing an "autnum"
   member and an "operator" member.  The "operator" member is as
   specified in Section 4.1.  Additionally, queries specifically for the
   operator and/or contact information take the same form as in
   Section 4.1.

   The "autnum" member mentioned above as well as queries directly for
   the registration information take the form of a JSON object.

   name  an identifier assigned to the autnum registration by the

   description  -- a string containing descriptive text about the autnum
      registration

   The members "remarks", "uris", "registrationDate", "lastChangedDate",
   and "lastChangedBy" take the same form of the members of the same
   name of the entity object (Section 5).

4.3.  Reverse DNS

   A reverse DNS delegation query for both the registration and operator
   and/or contact information yields an object containing an "rdns"
   member and an "operator" member.  The "operator" member is as
   specified in Section 4.1.  Additionally, queries specifically for the
   operator and/or contact information take the same form as in
   Section 4.1.

   The "rdns" member mentioned above as well as queries directly for the
   reverse DNS information take the form of a JSON object.

5.  The Entity Object

   Throughout this document there is a need to represent the identity
   and contact information of organizations, corporations, governments,
   non-profits, clubs, individual persons, and informal groups of
   people.  All of these representations are so similar that it is best
   to represent them in JSON with one construct, the entity object.
   Such re-use is beleived to aid in the re-use of code by implementers.

   The following is an example of an entity:


       {
         "handle" : "XXXX-RIR",
         "names": [ "Joe Bob, Inc.", "Bobby Joe Shopping" ],
         "postalAddress" : [
           "123 Maple Ave",
           "Suite 90001",
           "Vancouver",
           "BC",
           "12393"
         ],
