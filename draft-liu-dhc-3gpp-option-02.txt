                     DHCP Options for 3GPP Service
                    draft-liu-dhc-3gpp-option-02.txt

Abstract

   This document defines a new option that can be used by DHCP clients
   in their signaling sent to DHCP servers, when those clients need to
   associate a request for an IP address or IPv6 prefix with a given
   3GPP packet service.It is intended for scenarios of interworking
   between a non-3GPP access and a 3GPP network.

1.  Introduction

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is built on a client-
   server model, where designated DHCP server allocate network addresses
   and deliver configuration parameters to dynamically configured hosts.
   The changes to [RFC2131][RFC3315] defined in this document defines
   the use of 3GPP specific option transferred to DHCP server by DHCP
   client.

3.  Problem Statement

   In 3GPP TS 23.402, 3GPP UE can access the 3GPP EPC through non-3GPP
   IP access.

   When the non 3GPP access is Trusted, there is no need for the 3GPP UE
   to establish a Layer 3 tunnel (IPSec [RFC4301], DSMIPv6 [RFC 5555])
   to access the EPC as it can rely upon the non 3GPP access security
   mechanisms.  In this case, the 3GPP UE may send DHCP signaling to non
   3GPP access to acquire an IP address.  However, the 3GPP UE may wish
   to associate its request for an IP address with IP services provided
   by the 3GPP EPC or may conversely explicitly require that its traffic
   is not sent to the EPC but offloaded, even though the UE has been
   authenticated via its 3GPP credentials (the service is called "NSO"
   i.e.  Non Seamless Offload).

   The APN (Access Point Name) is the parameter by which a 3GPP UE
   signals the kind of EPC service it desires.  Based on the value of
   this parameter, a 3GPP IP Edge (a PDN GW) is selected and the PDN GW
   is able to determine the IP features to deliver to the traffic
   exchanged by the UE as part of this APN.

   It should be noted that the set of IP configuration parameters that
   the UE may receive via a DHCP response (e.g. the DNS server(s)
   address) may also be influenced by the value of the APN.

   Thus when requesting an IP address via DHCP, a 3GPP UE should be able
   to indicate:

   o Whether this IP address is for NSO or whether it is for an EPC
   service.

   o If the IP address is for an EPC service, the value of the APN
   corresponding to the IP services reached when using this IP address.
   The UE may also request an EPC service without providing an APN
   value; in this case, the network uses a default APN value.

   Such DHCP request may be sent when the UE requests access to EPC via
   non 3GPP access, or when the UE performs mobility from a 3GPP access
   to a non 3GPP access.

   This document is intended to define a new DHCP option for "3GPP
   Service".

4.  3GPP-Service Option Format

   A DHCP client within a 3GPP based device sets the "3GPP-Service"
   Option in the DHCP request it sends to the network to indicate the
   desired 3GPP service associated with that request.

   A DHCP server willing to indicate it has taken into account the
   parameters / sub-options of a "3GPP-Service" Option included by the
   client in a DHCP request mirrors these parameters in the DHCP
   signaling it sends back to the client.

4.1.  APN Sub-option Format

   The purpose of 3GPP-APN (Access Point Name) Sub-option is sent by UE
   to network for identifing the packet data network associated with the
   DHCP message.  The APN is defined in 3GPP TS 23.401[TS23401].

   The 3GPP-APN Sub-option SHOULD only be present once in a DHCP
   message.  If it is present more than once, the value of the last
   occurrence of the option supersedes the value of the other
   occurrences of this sub-option.

4.2.  Non Seamless WLAN Offload (3GPP-Service-Type)Sub-option Format

   The purpose of 3GPP-Service-Type (Non Seamless Offload) Sub-option is
   to identify whether the DHCP message is to be associated with a Non
   Seamless Offload service or with an EPC service.

   option SHOULD be provided in the same DHCP message than the 3GPP-
   Service-Type Sub-option, when the 3GPP-Service-Type sub-option
   includes EPC indication.  NSO indication and EPC indication are
   exclusive.

   If the 3GPP-Service-Type Sub-option includes NSO indication, and if
   3GPP-APN Sub-option is included, the 3GPP-APN Sub-option is ignored.

5.  DHCP Client Behavior

   For DHCPv4 protocol, a DHCP client may include a "3GPP-Service"
   option in the option payload of DHCPDISCOVER and DHCP REQUEST
   messages being sent toward a DHCP server in order to associate its
   request with IP services provided by the 3GPP EPC or to explicitly
   require that its traffic is not sent to the EPC but offloaded

   For DHCPv6 protocol, DHCP client may include a "3GPP-Service" option
   in the option payload of SOLICIT message being sent toward a DHCP
   server in order to associate its request with IP services provided by
   the 3GPP EPC or to explicitly require that its traffic is not sent to
   the EPC but offloaded.


   If the answer from the DHCP server does not include a "3GPP-Service"
   option, the DHCP client assumes that the answer is not associated
   with an EPC service.

6.  DHCP Server Behavior

   A DHCP server that receives a "3GPP-Service" option from a DHCP
   client but does not support this option, MUST ignore this option and
   MUST NOT provide this option in the signaling it sends back towards
   the DHCP client.

   Conversely, when a DHCP server has taken this option into account it
   MUST provide this option in the signaling it sends back towards the
   DHCP client.

   A DHCP server supporting this option SHOULD take the content of this
   option into account when trying to serve the DHCP client.  This may
   involve making sure relevant signaling (e.g.  GTP,PMIP [RFC5213]) is
   sent to an EPC gateway determined using the parameters of the "3GPP-
   Service" option.
