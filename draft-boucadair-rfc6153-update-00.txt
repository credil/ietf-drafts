 Updates to DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 Options for Access Network Discovery and
                  Selection Function (ANDSF) Discovery
                   draft-boucadair-rfc6153-update-00

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 6153 by correcting IANA allocations made
   for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options for Access Network Discovery and
   Selection Function (ANDSF) Discovery.  This document assigns a code
   for DHCPv6 option for ANDSF and withdraws an already assigned DHCPv4
   option code.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC6153] defines a DHCPv4 option (called OPTION-IPv4_Address-ANDSF)
   [RFC2131] and a DHCPv6 option (called OPTION-IPv6_Address-ANDSF)
   [RFC3315] to enable a mobile node to discover Access Network
   Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) entities in an IP network.
   Nevertheless, IANA assigned mistakenly two DHCPv4 option codes
   instead of one DHCPv4 option code and a DHCPv6 option code.

   This document updates [RFC6153] by assigning a code for DHCPv6 option
   for ANDSF and withdrawing an already assigned DHCPv4 option code.

2.  Update to RFC 6153

   In order to be backward compatible with existing implementations,
   IANA MUST assign 143 as a DHCPv6 option code for OPTION-IPv6_Address-
   ANDSF.

   This document changes section 6 of [RFC6153] as follows:

   OLD:

   This document defines two new DHCP options as described in Sections 2
    and 3:

    ANDSF IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4 (OPTION-IPv4_Address-ANDSF) 142

   NEW:

    IANA has assigned the following new DHCPv6 Option Code in the
    registry maintained in
    http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters:

                                       Option Name Value
                         ------------------------- -----
                         OPTION-IPv6_Address-ANDSF 143

    IANA has assigned the following new DHCPv4 Option Code in the
    registry maintained in http://www.iana.org/assignments/bootp-dhcp-
    parameters/:

                                       Option Name Value
                         ------------------------- -----
                         OPTION-IPv4_Address-ANDSF 142


3.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are discussed in [RFC6153].

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  DHCPv6 Option

   IANA is requested to assign the following new DHCPv6 Option Code in
   the registry maintained in http://www.iana.org/assignments/
   dhcpv6-parameters:

                                    Option Name Value
                      ------------------------- -----
                      OPTION-IPv6_Address-ANDSF 143


4.2.  DHCPv4 Option

   IANA is requested to return the following value to the available
   DHCPv4 Option Codes space maintained in http://www.iana.org/
   assignments/bootp-dhcp-parameters/:
