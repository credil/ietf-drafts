1. Introduction

   This draft describes how data center network can benefit from non-
   RBridge nodes performing TRILL encapsulation with assistance from
   directory service.

   [RBridge-directory] describes the framework for RBridge edge to get
   MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping from a directory service in data
   center environment instead of flooding unknown DAs across TRILL
   domain. When directory is used, any node, even non-RBridge node, can

   perform the TRILL encapsulation. This draft is to demonstrate the
   benefits of non-RBridge nodes performing TRILL encapsulation.

3. Directory Assistance to Non-RBridge

   With directory assistance [RBridge-Directory], a non-RBridge can
   determine if a packet needs to be forwarded across the RBridge
   domain. Suppose the RBridge domain boundary starts at network
   switches (i.e. not virtual switches embedded on servers), a
   directory can assist Virtual Switches embedded on servers to
   encapsulate proper TRILL header by providing the information of the
   egress RBridge edge to which the target is attached. If a target is
   not attached to other RBridge edge nodes based on the directory
   [RBridge-Directory], the non-RBridge node can forward the data
   frames natively, i.e. not encapsulating any TRILL header.

           Figure 1: TRILL domain in typical Data Center Network


   When a TRILL encapsulated data packet reaches the ingress RBridge,
   the ingress RBridge can simply forward the pre-encapsulated packet
   to the RBridge that is specified in the DA field of the TRILL header
   of the data frame. When the ingress RBridge receives a native
   Ethernet frame, it only forward the data frame to the directly
   attached bridged LAN.

   Under this environment, the ingress RBridge doesn't need to flood
   the received Ethernet data frames to TRILL domain when the DA in the
   Ethernet data frames is unknown. Under this scheme, for an RBridge
   with multiple ports connected to a bridged LAN, data frames received
   from TRILL domain, decapsulated and forwarded to the bridged LAN via
   one port, and flooded back to the RBridge via another port, won't be
   encapsulated again and forwarded back TRILL domain.

   That means there is no need to worry about AF ports and all RBridge
   edge ports connected to one bridged LAN can receive and forward pre-
   encapsulated traffic, which greatly improves the overall network
   utilization.

   Note: [RBridge] Section 4.6.2 Bullet 8 specifies that an RBridge
   port can be configured to accept TRILL encapsulated frames from a
   neighbor that is not an RBridge.

   When data frames do not need to be sent across RBridge domain, they
   are switched by all nodes/ports per IEEE802.1Q and RBridge edge will

   not encapsulate and forward native Ethernet frames across RBridge
   domain.

   When a pre-encapsulated TRILL frame arrives at an RBridge whose
   nickname matches with the destination nickname in the TRILL header,
   the processing is exactly same as normal, i.e. it decapsulates the
   native frame from the received TRILL frame and forwards the
   decapsulated Ethernet frame to the target attached to its edge
   ports.

   We call a node that only performs the TRILL encapsulation but
   doesn't participate in RBridge's IS-IS routing a ''TRILL
   Encapsulating node'' or ''Simplified RBridge''. The TRILL Encapsulating
   Node gets the MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping table pushed down or
   pulled from directory servers [RBridge-directory]. Upon receiving a
   native Ethernet frame, the TRILL Encapsulating Node checks the
   MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping table, and perform the corresponding
   TRILL encapsulation if the entry is found in the mapping table. If
   the destination address and VLAN of the received Ethernet frame
   doesn't exist in the mapping table, the Ethernet frame is forwarded
   per IEEE802.1Q.

4. Source Nickname in Frames Encapsulated by Non-RBridge Nodes

   The TRILL header includes a Source RBridge's Nickname (ingress) and
   Destination RBridge's Nickname (egress). When a TRILL header is
   added by a non-RBridge node, using the Ingress RBridge edge node's
   nickname in the source address field will make the ingress RBridge
   node receive TRILL frames with its own nickname in the frames'
   source address field, which can be confusing.

   To avoid confusion of edge RBridges receiving TRILL encapsulated
   frames with their own nickname in the frames' source address field
   from neighboring non-RBridge nodes, a new nickname can be given to
   an RBridge edge node, e.g. Phantom Nickname, to represent all the
   TRILL Encapsulating Nodes attached to the RBridge edge node.

   When the Phantom Nickname is used in the Source Address field of a
   TRILL frame, it is understood that the TRILL encapsulation is
   actually done by a non-RBridge node which is attached to an edge
   port of an RBridge Ingress node.

5. Conclusion and Recommendation

    When directory service is available, nodes that are outside TRILL
    domain, i.e. don't participate in TRILL IS/IS routing protocol,
    become capable of encapsulating TRILL header for data frames
    destined for remote RBridges that is not on the same bridged LAN.
    The non-RBridge encapsulation approach is especially useful when
    there are many servers in a data center equipped with hypervisor-
    based virtual switches.  It is relatively easy for virtual switches,
    which are usually software based, to get directory assistance and
    perform network address encapsulation.
