 Routers auto-configuration using Route Information Option from ICMPv6
                         Router Advertisements
                  draft-pfister-moving-net-autoconf-00

Abstract

   This draft defines a way for multiple routers that are communicating
   on a single link to exchange routing information using Router
   Advertisements.  This allows moving networks to communicate with each
   other through auto-configured routers.  This document specifies a new
   flag for the Router Information option from ICMPv6 Router
   Advertisement messages and specifies how routers must process such
   options.

Internet-Draft       Moving networks prefix exchange            May 2013


1.  Introduction and motivations

   The Neighbor Discovery protocol [NEIGHDISC] enables auto-
   configuration for hosts based on information provided by routers (in
   Router Advertisements).  It assumes routers to be access routers,
   advertising different on-link prefixes and providing access to the
   whole network, and thus mainly focuses on the last hop of networks.

   More specific options also exist in order to provide complementary
   informations for more complex and dynamic networks.  For example,
   ICMPv6 Router Advertisements can carry DNS configuration information
   [RADNS] or more specific route information [RIO].

   The Neighbor Discovery protocol well succeeds in configuring mobile
   hosts when visiting fixed networks served by fixed routers, but
   doesn't allow moving networks, served by an attached moving router,
   to interact with fixed or moving networks.

   This draft extends the Neighbor Discovery protocol.  It defines a new
   flag for the Route Information Option from [RIO] and specifies
   routers processing of such options when the flag is set.  Thus
   allowing moving networks to dynamically use routing information in a
   simpler and more dynamic way than existing routing protocols.
   Finally, we discuss the different possibilities of securing such
   process.

4.  Use case example

   In most cases, only hosts are considered to be mobile, but with the
   increase in the number of IP devices, we can expect the number of
   moving networks to highly increase in the next few years.  For
   example, cars will contain a lot of different devices, from pressure
   captors to infotainment terminals, all gathered in possibly complex
   networks.  The neighbor discovery protocol allows such devices to
   dynamically obtain their needed networking information, but routers
   that serves such networks cannot use this protocol to establish
   connexions with the infrastructure or other cars.

   This draft proposes to extend the Route Information option (RIO) use-
   case by allowing moving networks, that share a common link, to
   exchange routing information, and thus form multiple hops networks.

   The simplest example of such a situation happens when two routers,
   configured as default gateways for fixed networks, connect to the
   same link.  This draft allows them to advertise their respective
   prefixes on the visited link.

                         Visited link
        -------------------------------------------
   fe80::1 |                                    | fe80::2
         -----                                -----
        | R1  |                              | R2  |
         -----                                -----
           | fd00:1::/64                         | fd00:2::/64
       ---------                            ---------
       |       |                            |       |
      ---     ---                          ---     ---
     |H11|   |H12|                        |H21|   |H22|
      ---     ---                          ---     ---

             Figure 1: Two moving networks auto-configuration

   In this figure, two 1-hop networks, served by their respective
   default routers, come in communication range on a visited link.  This
   draft proposes a simplified procedure for those routers to exchange
   their internal prefixes (fd00:1::/64 and fd00:2::/64), thus allowing
   leaf nodes from one network (H11 and H12) to communicate with the
   nodes in the other network (H21 and H22).

5.  Message Format

   The RIO is defined in [RIO] as a Router Advertisement option.  It is
   used by routers to send preference information about specific routes
   that hosts can take into account in their route selection process.
   This document proposes to reserve the bit 24 for Mobile Network
   Prefix flag.

   'M':             Mobile Network Prefix flag.  It MUST be set to 1 if
                    this Route Information option can be used by a
                    router and set to 0 otherwise.

   'R':             Two reserved bits.  They MUST be initialized to zero
                    by the sender and ignored by the receiver.

   A router sets the 'M' flag when it wants receiving routers to modify
   their routing table in order to use itself as next hop for the
   specified prefix, with the specified preference.  If the flag is set,
   a router MAY use this information in order to modify its routing
   table.  If not, it SHOULD ignore the option.  In both cases, a host
   MUST behave as specified in [RIO].

6.  Host Specifications

   [RIO] defines three different kind of valid behaviors for hosts.
   This document doesn't propose any modification for hosts.  Therefore,
   a host MUST ignore the Mobile Network Prefix flag.

7.  Router Specifications

7.1.  Router configuration

   Routers SHOULD NOT set the Mobile Network Prefix flag by default in
   the Route Information options they send but they SHOULD be
   configureable.

   The default behavior of router MUST be to ignore all received Route
   Information options.  But a router SHOULD be configurable in order to
   specify other behaviors.

7.2.  Accepting a Route Information option

   Routers SHOULD ignore all Route Information option which Mobile
   Network Prefix flag is not set.  When the flag is set, a router
   submits the option to its acceptation algorithm in order to decide
   whether to accept the RIO or not.

   Routers MAY accept all, none, or some of the RIOs which 'M' flag is
   set.  Such selection CAN be based on any kind of policy (source
   address, authentication, etc...).

7.3.  Using a Route Information option

   When accepted, a RIO is used as defined in [RIO] for type C hosts.
   The receiving router is free to give any metric to the newly
   introduced route.

   When routing a packet, longest prefix match is first used.  When
   different next-hops addresses exist for the same packet, with the
   same metric, routes that are obtained through Route Information
   options have the lowest priority.  The preference field is used in
   order to break ties between routes that were obtained with RIOs.

   Routing entries that are obtained with RIOs MUST be removed after at
   most 'Route lifetime' seconds unless its lifetime is extended by a
   newly received RIO from the same neighbor.  If so, the new preference
   value and timeout date override previously received values.

8.  Security Considerations

   The Neighbor Discovery protocol have some known security weaknesses.
   This draft doesn't intend to solve them.  Nevertheless, route auto-
   configuration for routers extends the scope of possible threats from
   a single node to a complete network.  Special care should therefore
   be taken when deciding whether to accept or reject a Route
   Information option.

8.1.  Using IPSec

   IPSec [IPSEC] can be used, in some cases, to secure the Neighbor
   Discovery messages.  But, as it only supports security associations
   between pairs of nodes, it requires unicast communications.  Care
   should therefore be taken when considering this solution in order to
   avoid congestion.

8.2.  Using SeND

   SeND [SEND] uses public-key cryptography in order to broadcast signed
   Router Advertisements.  X.509 certificates are used in order to
   certify the right of routers to advertise a set of prefixes.  This
   document proposes to extends the right of advertising a prefix (in
   Prefix Information options) to the right of advertising the same
   prefixes in RIOs.

   In other words, when SeND is enabled, a router MUST NOT send RIOs
   containing prefixes it hasn't the right to send in Prefix Information
   options.

   The use of this protocol would not prevent a malicious node, present
   on the shared link, to spoof IPs from both networks, to eaves-drop,
   or potentially to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, depending on the
   shared link security.  Connected networks should therefore use higher
   layers security in order to establish point-to-point secured
   connexions.

      Information option.
