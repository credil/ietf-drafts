     Abstract 

        This document defines a framework for providing Energy 
        Management for devices within or connected to communication 
        networks.  The framework defines an Energy Management Domain as 
        a set of Energy Objects, for which each Energy Object is 
        identified, classified and given context.   Energy Objects can 
        be monitored and/or controlled with respect to Power, Power 
        State, Energy, Demand, Power Quality, and battery.  Additionally 
        the framework models relationships and capabilities between 
        Energy Objects.

        TO DO/OPEN ISSUE 
        - Do we want to add some examples such as 
          http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/81/slides/eman-4.pdf slide 14 
          to 1]? Proposal: add it to [EMAN-AS] 
        - Do we need variable range of states (i.e. dimmer)? Is this a 
          requirement? How to model the batteries, as a component or a 
          relationship? See the meeting minutes:

             o "Modeling of the battery?  If we are not modeling 
               components then why model batteries? Use the Entity MIB"  
        - Comment from Prantl on the list, related to energy control: 
          non-discrete power-states are not supported -> Section 5.5. 
          specifies the possibility of mapping  
          "Manufacturer" Power States to the 12 Eman Power states, 
          where there can be more than 12 Manufacturer Power States. 
          However, in the context of power-capping of Servers we have a 
          "non-discrete" floating cap corresponding to the Manufacturer 
          Power State. 
          The Problem is that different Servers will have completely 
          different ranges of supported cap-values, e.g. Server 1 has a 
          dynamic range of 300-500Watt, Server2 has a range of 70-
          270Watts. Now let's assume Powerstate 9=400 Watts for 
          Server1, but would be 170Watts for Server2. Which would mean 
          I have to specify a Mapping for each Server-Model. 
          It would be far more practical if it would be possible to 
          supply a key-value-pair with a certain power-state in Case 
          the State needs context such as a power-cap, I would then 
          specify a state of e.g. 7 and supply the desired Cap in the 
          kvp-field. 
          PROPOSAL:  
               1. decide if we need a variable power state that is a 
                 percent of maximum. 
               2. Power-capping can be done by the EnMS. [EMAN-AS] to 
                 document this use case.  
                  
      
           
      
         
     1. Introduction 

        Network management is divided into the five main areas defined 
        in the ISO Telecommunications Management Network model: Fault, 
        Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security Management 
        (FCAPS) [X.700].   Absent from this management model is any 
        consideration of Energy Management, which is now becoming a 
        critical area of concern worldwide as seen in [ISO50001].  
         
        Note that Energy Management has particular challenges in that a 
        power distribution network is responsible for the supply of 
        energy to various devices and components, while a separate 
        communication network is typically used to monitor and control 
        the power distribution network. 
         
        This document defines a framework for providing Energy 
        Management for devices within or connected to communication

     Internet-Draft             <EMAN Framework>            Oct 2011 
      
        networks.  The framework describes how to identify, classify and 
        provide context for a device in a communications network from 
        the point of view of Energy Management. 
      
        The identified device, called Energy Objects, can then be 
        monitored for Energy Management by obtaining measurements for 
        Power, Energy, Demand and Power Quality.  If a device contains a 
        battery(s) the characteristics and performance of the battery(s) 
        can also be managed.  An Energy Object state can be monitored or 
        controlled by providing an interface expressed as one or more 
        Power State Sets.  The most basic example of Energy Management 
        is a single Energy Object reporting information about itself.  
        However, in many cases, Energy is not measured by the Energy 
        Object itself, but by a meter located upstream in the power 
        distribution tree.  An example is a power distribution unit 
        (PDU) that measures Energy consumption of attached devices and 
        may report this to an Energy Management System (EnMS).  
        Therefore, Energy Objects are recognized as having relationships 
        to other devices in the network from the point of view of Energy 
        Management.  These relationships include Aggregation 
        Relationship, Metering Relationship, Power Source Relationship , 
        Proxy Relationship , and Dependency Relationship.  
      
                             
     1.1. Energy Management Document Overview 

      
        The EMAN standard provides a set of specifications for Energy 
        Management.  This document specifies the framework, per the 
        Energy Management requirements specified in [EMAN-REQ] 
         
        The applicability statement document [EMAN-AS] provides a list 
        of use cases, cross-reference between existing standards and the 
        EMAN standard, and shows how the this relates to other 
        frameworks. 
         
        The [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] specifies objects for addressing Energy 
        Object Identification, classification, context information, and 
        relationships form the point of view of Energy Management. 
                           
        The Power and Energy Monitoring MIB [EMAN-MON-MIB] contains  
        objects for monitoring of Power, Energy, Demand, Power Quality 
        and Power State Sets. 
         
        Definition of Managed Objects for Battery Monitoring [EMAN-
        BATTERY-MIB] defines managed objects that provide information on 
        the status of batteries in managed devices.

     2. Requirements & Use Cases  

        Requirements for Power and Energy monitoring for networking 
        devices are specified in [EMAN-REQ].  The Energy Management use 
        cases covered by this framework are covered in the EMAN 
        applicability statement document in [EMAN-AS].  Typically 
        requirements and use cases for communication networks cover the 
        devices that make up the communication network and endpoints.  
         
        With Energy Management, there exists a wide variety of devices 
        that may be contained in the same deployments as a communication 
        network but comprise a separate facility, home, or power 
        distribution network.   

        Target devices for the Energy Management are all Energy Objects 
        that can directly or indirectly be monitored or controlled by an 
        Energy Management System (EnMS) using the Internet protocol, for 
        example:  
            - Simple electrical appliances / fixtures  
            - Hosts, such as a PC, a datacenter server, or a printer 
            - Routers  
            - Switches 
            - Switches with line card components  
            - Power over Ethernet (PoE) endpoints, 
            - Power Distribution Units (PDU)  
            - Protocol gateways devices for Building Management Systems 
        (BMS) 
            - Electrical Meters 
            - Sensor controllers with subtended sensors 
      
        There may also exist varying protocols deployed among these 
        power distributions and communication networks.  
         
        For an Energy Management framework to be useful, it should also 
        apply to these types of separate networks as they connect and 
        interact with a communications network.  
      
         
     3. Terminology 

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
        in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
         
        This section contains definitions of terms used throughout this 
        specification. Defined terms have their first letter 
        capitalized.

     4. Energy Management Reference Model 

        The scope of this framework is to enable network and network-
        attached devices to be administered for Energy Management.  The

        framework recognizes that in complex deployments Energy Objects 
        may communicate over varying protocols.  For example the 
        communications network may use IP Protocols (SNMP) but attached 
        Energy Object Parent may communicate to Energy Object Children 
        over serial communication protocols like BACNET, MODBUS etc.  
        The likelihood of getting these different topologies to convert 
        to a single protocol is not very high considering the rate of 
        upgrades of facilities and energy related devices. Therefore the 
        framework must address the simple case of a uniform IP network 
        and a more complex mixed topology/deployment. 
         
        As displayed in the Figure 1, the most basic energy reference 
        model is composed of an EnMS that obtains Energy Management 
        information from Energy Objects.  The Energy Object (EO) returns 
        information for Energy Management directly to the EnMS.  
         
        The protocol of choice for Energy Management is SNMP, as three 
        MIBs are specified for Energy Management: the energy-aware MIB 
        [EMAN-AWARE-MIB], the energy monitoring MIB [EMAN-MON-MIB], and 
        the battery MIB [EMAN-BATTERY-MIB].  However, the EMAN 
        requirement document [EMAN-REQ] also require the push of time 
        series of power values.  Therefore, IPFIX [RFC5101] is also 
        mentioned as the appropriate solution in the following figures, 
        even if there are no documents describing the IPFIX solution at 
        the time of writing these lines. Note that this framework 
        doesn't exclude another solution than IPFIX.

        Energy Managed Object Parent returns information for themselves 
        as well as information according to the Energy Managed Object

        While both the simple and complex Energy Management models 
        contain an EnMS, this framework doesn't impose any requirements 
        regarding a topology with a centralize EnMS or one with a 
        distributed Energy Management via the Energy Objects within the 
        deployment.

        Given the pattern in figure 2, the complex relationships between 
        Energy Objects can be modeled (refer also to section 5.3):     
             - A PoE device modeled as an Energy Object Parent with the 
               Power Source, Metering, and Proxy Relationships for this 
               Energy Object Child 
             - A PDU modeled as an Energy Object Parent with the Power 
               Source and Metering Relationships for the plugged in 
               host (the Energy Object Children) 
             - A PC with line cards modeled as an Energy Object Parent 
               with Dependency Relationships for the line cards (the 
               Energy Object Children) 
             - Building management gateway, used as proxy for non IP 
               protocols, is modeled as an Energy Object Parent with 
               the Proxy Relationship, and potentially the Aggregation 
               Relationship  
             - Etc. 
      
        The communication between the Energy Object Parent and Energy 
        Object Children is out of the scope of this framework. 
      
          
         
     5. Framework High Level Concepts and Scope 

        Energy Management can be organized into areas of concern that 
        include: 
         
        - Energy Object Identification and Context - for modeling and 
        planning  
        - Energy Monitoring - for energy measurements 
        - Energy Control - for optimization 
        - Energy Procurement - for optimization of resources 
         
        While an EnMS may be a central point for corporate reporting, 
        cost, environmental impact, and regulatory compliance, Energy 
        Management in this framework excludes Energy procurement and the 
        environmental impact of energy use.  As such the framework does 
        not include: 
        - Manufacturing costs of an Energy Object in currency or 
        environmental units 
        - Embedded carbon or environmental equivalences of an Energy 
        Object 
        - Cost in currency or environmental impact to dismantle or 
        recycle an Energy Object 
        - Relationship or capabilities of an Energy Object to an 
        electrical or smart grid 
        - Supply chain analysis of energy sources or Energy Object 
        deployment

        - Conversion of the usage or production of energy to units 
        expressed from the source of that energy (such as the greenhouse 
        gas emissions associated with 1000kW from a diesel source). 
         
        The next sections describe Energy Management organized into the 
        following areas: 
         
          - Energy Object and Energy Management Domain 
          - Energy Object Identification and Context  
          - Energy Object Relationships 
          - Energy Monitoring  
          - Energy Control   
          - Deployment Topologies 
         
         
     5.1. Energy Object and Energy Management Domain 

        In building management, a meter refers to the meter provided by 
        the utility used for billing and measuring power to an entire 
        building or unit within a building.  A sub-meter refers to a 
        customer or user installed meter that is not used by the utility 
        to bill but instead used to get readings from sub portions of a 
        building.  

        An Energy Management Domain should map 1-1 with a metered or 
        sub-metered portion of the site.  An Energy Object is part of a 
        single Energy Management Domain.  The Energy Management Domain 
        should be configured on an Energy Object.  An Energy Object 
        Child may inherit the domain value from an Energy Object Parent 
        or the Energy Management Domain may be configured directly in an 
        Energy Object Child.  

          

     5.2. Energy Object Identification and Context  

     5.2.1 Energy Object Identification 

        Energy Objects MUST contain a value that uniquely identifies the 
        Energy Object among all the Energy Management Domains within an 
        EnMS.  A universal identifier (UUID) [RFC4122] MUST be used to 
        uniquely identify an Energy Object.  

        Every Energy Object should have a unique printable name. 
        Possible naming conventions are: textual DNS name, MAC-address 
        of the device, interface ifName, or a text string uniquely 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 30, 2012           [Page 13] 
         
     Internet-Draft             <EMAN Framework>            Oct 2011 
      
        identifying the Energy Object.  As an example, in the case of IP 
        phones, the Energy Object name can be the device DNS name. 

         

     5.2.2 Context in General 

        In order to aid in reporting and in differentiation between 
        Energy Objects, each Energy Object optionally contains 
        information establishing its business, site, or organizational 
        context within a deployment, i.e. the Energy Object Context. 

         

     5.2.3 Context: Importance 

        An Energy Object can provide an importance value in the range of 
        1 to 100 to help differentiate a device's use or relative value 
        to the site.  The importance range is from 1 (least important) 
        to 100 (most important).  The default importance value is 1.   

        For example: A typical office environment has several types of 
        phones, which can be rated according to their business impact.  
        A public desk phone has a lower importance (for example, 10) 
        than a business-critical emergency phone (for example, 100).  As 
        another example: A company can consider that a PC and a phone 
        for a customer-service engineer is more important than a PC and 
        a phone for lobby use. 

        Although EnMS and administrators can establish their own 
        ranking, the following is a broad recommendation: 

        . 90 to 100 Emergency response  

        . 80 to 90 Executive or business-critical  

        . 70 to 79 General or Average  

        . 60 to 69 Staff or support  

        . 40 to 59 Public or guest  

        . 1  to 39 Decorative or hospitality

     5.2.4 Context: Keywords 

        An Energy Object can provide a set of keywords.  These keywords 
        are a list of tags that can be used for grouping and summary 
        reporting within or between Energy Management Domains.  All 
        alphanumeric characters and symbols, such as #, (, $, !, and &, 
        are allowed.  Potential examples are: IT, lobby, HumanResources, 
        Accounting, StoreRoom, CustomerSpace, router, phone, floor2, or 
        SoftwareLab.  There is no default value for a keyword. 

        Multiple keywords can be assigned to a device.  In such cases, 
        the keywords are separated by commas and no spaces between 
        keywords are allowed.  For example, "HR,Bldg1,Private". 

        Another keyword use case is the virtual grouping of Energy 
        Objects.  For example, a Power Distribution Unit (PDU) that 
        allows physical entities like outlets to be "ganged" together as 
        a logical entity for simplified management purposes.  This is 
        particularly useful for servers with multiple power supplies, 
        where each power supply is connected to a different physical 
        outlet.  Other implementations allow "gangs" to be created based 
        on common ownership of outlets, such as business units or load 
        shed priority or other non-physical relationships.  For example, 
        current PDU implementations allow for an "M-to-N" mapping 
        between outlet "gangs" and physical outlets: 

              Outlet 1             (physical entity) 

              Outlet 2             (physical entity) 

              Outlet 3             (physical entity) 

              Outlet 4             (physical entity) 

              Outlet Gang A        (virtual entity) 

              Outlet Gang B        (virtual entity) 

              Gang A -> Outlets 1, 2 and 3 

              Gang B -> Outlets 3 and 4 

        Note the allowed overlap on Outlet 3, where Outlet 3 belongs to 
        both "gangs".  The keywords concept for this specific example 
        would be used as such: 

              Outlet 1        Energy Object 1, keywords: gangA 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 30, 2012           [Page 15] 
         
     Internet-Draft             <EMAN Framework>            Oct 2011 
      
              Outlet 2        Energy Object 2, keywords: gangA 

              Outlet 3        Energy Object 3, keywords: gangA, gangB 

              Outlet 4        Energy Object 4, keywords: gangB 

        Each "Outlet Gang" virtual entity, aggregated based on the value 
        of the keywords, reports the aggregated data from the individual 
        outlet entities that comprise it.  The same concept enables a 
        single point of control for all the individual outlet entities.  
        For example, turning "Outlet Gang A" to the "off" state would 
        turn outlets 1, 2, and 3 "off" in some implementations.  Note 
        that the impact of this action on "Outlet Gang B" is out of 
        scope of this document. 

         

     5.2.5 Context: Role 

        An Energy Object can provide a "role description" string that 
        indicates the purpose the Energy Object serves in the EnMS.  
        This could be a string describing the context the device 
        fulfills in deployment. 

        Administrators can define any naming scheme for the role of a 
        device.  As guidance a two-word role that combines the service 
        the device provides along with type can be used [IPENERGY] 

        Example types of devices: Router, Switch, Light, Phone, 
        WorkStation, Server, Display, Kiosk, HVAC.

     5.3. Energy Object Relationships 

        Two Energy Objects MAY establish an Energy Object Relationship. 
        Within a relationship one Energy Object becomes an Energy Object 
        Parent while the other becomes an Energy Object Child. . 

        For Example: A Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) device (such as an IP 
        phone or an access point) is attached to a switch port.  The 
        switch is the source of Power for the attached device, so the 
        Energy Object Parent is the switch, and the Energy Object Child 
        is the device attached to the switch.   

        The communication between the parent and child for monitoring or 
        collection of power data is left to the device manufacturer.  
        For example: A parent switch may use LLDP to communicate with a 
        connected child, and a parent lighting controller may use BACNET 
        to communicate with child lighting devices. 

        The Energy Object Child MUST keep track of its Energy Object 
        Parent(s) along with the Energy Object Relationships type.  The 
        Energy Object Parent MUST keep track of its Energy Object 
        Child(ren). 

        While the Energy Object Relationships provide the different 
        topologies information to all the EnMS in a consistent way, 
        their implementation is optional.  

         

     5.3.1 Energy Object Children Discovery 

        There are multiple ways that the Energy Object Parent can 
        discover its Energy Object Children, if they are not present on 
        the same physical network: 
         
          . In case of PoE, the Energy Object Parent automatically 
             discovers an Energy Object Child when the Child requests 
             power. 
          . The Energy Object Parent and Children may run the Link 
             Layer Discovery Protocol [LLDP], or any other discovery

             protocol, such as Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP).  The 
             Energy Object Parent might even support the LLDP-MED MIB 
             [LLDP-MED-MIB], which returns extra information on the 
             Energy Object Children.  
          . The Energy Object Parent may reside on a network connected 
             facilities gateway.  A typical example is a converged 
             building gateway, monitoring several other devices in the 
             building, and serving as a proxy between SNMP and a 
             protocol such as BACNET.  
          . Energy Object Parent/Energy Object Child relationships may 
             be set by manual or automatic network configuration 
             functions. 
              
        Note that the communication specifications between the Energy 
        Object Parent and Children is out of the scope of this document.   
         
        When an Energy Object Parent is a Proxy, the Energy Object 
        Parent should enumerate the capabilities it is providing for the 
        Energy Object Child.  The child would express that it wants its 
        parent to proxy capabilities such as, energy reporting, power 
        state configurations, non physical wake capabilities (such as 
        WoL)), or any combination of capabilities. 
         
         
     5.4. Energy Monitoring 

        For the purposes of this framework Energy will be limited to 
        electrical energy in watt hours.  Other forms of Energy Objects 
        that use or produce non-electrical energy may be part of an 
        Energy Management Domain but MUST provide information converted 
        to and expressed in watt hours. 

        Each Energy Object will have information that describes Power 
        information along with how that measurement was obtained or 
        derived.  For Energy Objects that can report actual Power 
        readings an optional Energy measurement can be provided. 

        Optionally, an Energy Object can further describe the Power 
        information with Power Quality information reflecting the 
        electrical characteristics of the measurement. 

        Optionally, an Energy Object that can report actual Power 
        readings can have odometers that provide the Energy used, 
        produced, and net Energy in Kwh.  These values are odometers 
        that accumulate the Power readings.  If Energy values are 
        returned then the three odometers must be provided along a 
        description of accuracy.

        Optionally, an Energy Object can provide Demand information over 
        time  

         

     5.4.1 Power Measurement 

        A Power measurement must be qualified with the units, magnitude, 
        direction of power flow, and by what means the measurement was 
        made (ex: Root Mean Square versus Nameplate). 

        In addition, the Energy Object should describe how it intends to 
        measure Power as one of consumer, producer or meter of usage.  
        Given the intent readings can be summarized or analyzed by an 
        EnMS.  For example metered usage reported by a meter and 
        consumption usage reported by a device connected to that meter 
        may naturally measure the same usage.  With the two measurements 
        identified by intent a proper summarization can be made by an 
        EMS. 

        Power measurement magnitude should conform to the IEC 61850 
        definition of unit multiplier for the SI (System International) 
        units of measure.  Measured values are represented in SI units 
        obtained by BaseValue * 10 raised to the power of the scale.  
        For example, if current power usage of an Energy Object is 3, it 
        could be 3 W, 3 mW, 3 KW, or 3 MW, depending on the value of the 
        scaling factor.  Energy is often billed in kilowatt-hours 
        instead of megajoules from the SI units.  Similarly, battery 
        charge is often measured as miliamperes-hour (mAh) instead of 
        coulombs from the SI units.  The units used in this framework 
        are: W, A, Wh, Ah, V.  A conversion from Wh to Joule and from Ah 
        to Coulombs is obviously possible, and can be described if 
        required. 

        In addition to knowing the usage and magnitude, it is useful to 
        know how an Energy Object usage measurement was obtained:  

        . Whether the measurements were made at the device itself or 
        from a remote source. 

        . Description of the method that was used to measure the power 
        and whether this method can distinguish actual or estimated 
        values.  

        An EMS can use this information to account for the accuracy and 
        nature of the reading between different implementations. 


      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 30, 2012           [Page 19] 
         
     Internet-Draft             <EMAN Framework>            Oct 2011 
      
        The EMS can use the Nameplate Power for provisioning, capacity 
        planning and potentially billing. 

         

     5.4.2 Optional Power Quality 

        Given a Power measurement, it may in certain circumstances be 
        desirable to know the Power Quality associated with that 
        measurement.  The information model must adhere to the IEC 61850 
        7-2 standard for describing AC measurements.  Note that the 
        Power Quality include two sets of characteristics: 
        characteristics as received from the utility, and 
        characteristics depending on how the Power is used. 

        In some Energy Management Domains, the power quality may not be 
        needed, available, or relevant to the EMS.   

        Optional Demand  

        It is well known in commercial electrical utility rates that 
        Demand is used as a measurement for billing.  Also the highest 
        peak demand measured over a time horizon, such as 1 month or 1 
        year, is often the basis for charges.  A single window of time 
        of high usage can penalize the consumer with higher energy 
        consumption charges.  However, it is relevant to measure the 
        Demand only when there are actual power measurements from an 
        Energy Object, and not when the power measurement is assumed or 
        predicted.    

        Optional Battery  

        Some Energy Objects may use batteries for storing Energy and for 
        receiving power supply.  These Energy Objects should report 
        their current power supply (battery, power line, etc.) and the 
        battery status for each contained battery.  Battery-specific 
        information to be reported should include the number of 
        batteries contained in the device and per battery 

        . battery type 

        . nominal and remaining capacity 

        . current charge 

        . current state (charging, discharging, not in use, etc.) 

        . number of charging cycles

        . expected remaining time that the battery can serve as power 
        supply 

        . expected remaining lifetime of the battery 

        Beyond that a device containing a battery should be able to 
        generate alarms when the battery charge falls below a given 
        threshold and when the battery needs to be replaced.  

         

     5.5. Energy Control  

        Energy Objects can be controlled by setting it to a Power State. 
        Power States Sets can be seen as an interface by which an Energy 
        Object can be controlled.  Each Energy Object should indicate 
        the Power State Sets that it implements.  Well known Power State 
        Sets should be registered with IANA 

        When and individual Power State is configured from a specific 
        Power State Set, an Energy Object may be busy at the request 
        time.  The Energy Object will set the desired state and then 
        update the actual Power State when the priority task is 
        finished.  This mechanism implies two different Power State 
        variables: actual versus desired 

        There are several standards and implementations of Power State 
        Set.  An Energy Object can support one or multiple Power State 
        Set implementations concurrently.  

        This framework list three initial possible Power State Series 
        that can be supported by an Energy Object:  

        IEEE1621 - [IEEE1621] 

        DMTF - [DMTF] 

        EMAN - Specified here 

         

     5.5.1 IEEE1621 Power State Series 

        The IEEE1621 Power State Series [IEEE1621] consists of 3 
        rudimentary states : on, off or sleep. 

          on(0)    - The device is fully On and all features of the 
        device are in working mode.

          off(1)   - The device is mechanically switched off and does 
        not consume energy.  

          sleep(2) - The device is in a power saving mode, and some 
        features may not be available immediately. 

         

     5.5.2 DMTF Power State Series 

        DMTF [DMTF] standards organization has defined a power profile 
        standard based on the CIM (Common Information Model) model that 
        consists of 15 power states ON (2), SleepLight (3), SleepDeep 
        (4), Off-Hard (5), Off-Soft (6), Hibernate(7), PowerCycle Off-
        Soft (8), PowerCycle Off-Hard (9), MasterBus reset (10), 
        Diagnostic Interrupt (11), Off-Soft-Graceful (12), Off-Hard 
        Graceful (13), MasterBus reset Graceful (14), Power-Cycle Off-
        Soft Graceful (15), PowerCycle-Hard Graceful (16).  DMTF 
        standard is targeted for hosts and computers.  Details of the 
        semantics of each Power State within the DMTF Power State Series 
        can be obtained from the DMTF Power State Management Profile 
        specification [DMTF]. 

        DMTF power profile extends ACPI power states.  The following 
        table provides a mapping between DMTF and ACPI Power State 
        Series and EMAN Power State Sets (described in the next 
        section):

     5.5.3 EMAN Power State Set 

        The EMAN Power State Set represents an attempt for a uniform 
        standard approach to model the different levels of Power of a 
        device.  The EMAN Power States are an expansion of the basic 
        Power States as defined in [IEEE1621] that also incorporate the 
        Power States defined in [ACPI] and [DMTF].  Therefore, in 
        addition to the non-operational states as defined in [ACPI] and 
        [DMTF] standards, several intermediate operational states have 
        been defined.  

        There are twelve Power States, that expand on [IEEE1621] on, 
        sleep and off.  The expanded list of Power States are divided 
        into six operational states, and six non-operational states.  
        The lowest non-operational state is 1 and the highest is 6.  
        Each non-operational state corresponds to an [ACPI] Global and 
        System states between G3 (hard-off) and G1 (sleeping).  For each 
        operational state represent a performance state, and may be 
        mapped to [ACPI] states P0 (maximum performance power) through 
        P5 (minimum performance and minimum power).  

        In each of the non-operational states (from mechoff(1) to 
        ready(6)), the Power State preceding it is expected to have a 
        lower Power value and a longer delay in returning to an 
        operational state:  

        IEEE1621 Power(off): 

                 mechoff(1) : An off state where no Energy Object 
        features are available.  The Energy Object is unavailable.  No 
        energy is being consumed and the power connector can be removed. 
        This corresponds to ACPI state G3.                  

                 softoff(2) : Similar to mechoff(1), but some components 
        remain powered or receive trace power so that the Energy Object 
        can be awakened from its off state.  In softoff(2), no context 
        is saved and the device typically requires a complete boot when 
        awakened.  This corresponds to ACPI state G2. 

        IEEE1621 Power(sleep) 

                 hibernate(3): No Energy Object features are available.   
        The Energy Object may be awakened without requiring a complete 
        boot, but the time for availability is longer than sleep(4). An

        example for state hibernate(3) is a save to-disk state where 
        DRAM context is not maintained.  Typically, energy consumption 
        is zero or close to zero.  This corresponds to state G1, S4 in 
        ACPI. 

                 sleep(4)    : No Energy Object features are available, 
        except for out-of-band management, for example wake-up 
        mechanisms.  The time for availability is longer than 
        standby(5). An example for state sleep(4) is a save-to-RAM 
        state, where DRAM context is maintained.  Typically, energy 
        consumption is close to zero.  This corresponds to state G1, S3 
        in ACPI. 

                 standby(5) : No Energy Object features are available, 
        except for out-of-band management, for example wake-up 
        mechanisms.  This mode is analogous to cold-standy.  The time 
        for availability is longer than ready(6).  For example, the 
        processor context is not maintained. Typically, energy 
        consumption is close to zero.  This corresponds to state G1, S2 
        in ACPI. 

                 ready(6)    : No Energy Object features are available, 
        except for out-of-band management, for example wake-up 
        mechanisms. This mode is analogous to hot-standby.  The Energy 
        Object can be quickly transitioned into an operational state.  
        For example, processors are not executing, but processor context 
        is maintained.  This corresponds to state G1, S1 in ACPI. 

        IEEE1621 Power(on): 

                 lowMinus(7) : Indicates some Energy Object features may 
        not be available and the Energy Object has selected 
        measures/options to provide less than low(8) usage.  This 
        corresponds to ACPI State G0.  This includes operational states 
        lowMinus(7) to full(12). 

                 low(8)      : Indicates some features may not be 
        available and the Energy Object has taken measures or selected 
        options to provideless than mediumMinus(9) usage.

     6. Structure of the Information Model: UML Representation 

        The following basic UML represents an information model 
        expression of the concepts in this framework.  This information 
        model, provided as a reference for implementers, is represented 
        as an MIB in the different related IETF Energy Monitoring 
        documents.  However, other programming structure with different 
        data models could be used as well. 
         
        Notation is a shorthand UML with lowercase types considered 
        platform or atomic types (i.e. int, string, collection). 
        Uppercase types denote classes described further.  Collections 
        and cardinality are expressed via qualifier notation.  
        Attributes labeled static are considered class variables and 
        global to the class.  Algorithms for class variable 
        initialization, constructors or destructors are not shown 
      
        EDITOR'S NOTE: the first part of the UML must be aligned with 
        the latest [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] document version.

          . Energy Object name: A unique printable name for the Energy 
             Object.  
          . Energy Object role: An administratively assigned name to 
             indicate the purpose an Energy Object serves in the 
             network.  
          . Energy Object importance: A ranking of how important the 
             Energy Object is, on a scale of 1 to 100, compared with 
             other Energy Objects in the same Energy Management Domain.  
          . Energy Object keywords: A list of keywords that can be used 
             to group Energy Objects for reporting or searching. 
          . Energy Management Domain: Specifies the name of an Energy 
             Management Domain for the Energy Object. 
          . Energy Object Power State: Specifies the current Power 
             State (0..12) for the Energy Object.  
          . Demand parameters: For example, which interval length to 
             report the Deman over, the number of intervals to keep, 
             etc. 
          . Assigning an Energy Object Parent to an Energy Object Child 
          . Assigning an Energy Object Child to an Energy Object 
             Parent. 
         
         
        This framework supports multiple means for setting the Power 
        State of a specific Energy Object. However, the Energy Object 
        might be busy executing an important task that requires the 
        current Power State for some more time.  For example, a PC might 
        have to finish a backup first, or an IP phone might be busy with 
        a current phone call.  Therefore a second value contains the 
        actual Power State.  A difference in values between the two 
        objects indicates that the Energy Object is currently in Power 
        State transition.  
         
        Other, already well established means for setting Power States, 
        such as DASH [DASH], already exist.  Such a protocol may be 
        implemented between the Energy Object Parent and the Energy 
        Object Child, when the Energy Object Parent acts as a Proxy.

        Note that the Wake-up-on-Lan (WoL) mechanism allows to 
        transition a device out of the Off Power State. 
         
         
         
     8. Fault Management 

        [EMAN-REQ] specifies some requirements about Power States such 
        as "the current state - the time of the last change", "the total 
        time spent in each state", "the number of transitions to each 
        state", etc.  Such requirements are fulfilled via the 
        pmPowerStateChange NOTIFICATION-TYPE [EMAN-MON-MIB].  This SNMP 
        notification is generated when the value(s) of Power State has 
        changed for the Energy Object. 
         
        Regarding high and low thresholding mechanism, the RMON alarm 
        and event [RFC2819] allows to periodically takes statistical 
        samples from Energy Object variables, compares them to 
        previously configured thresholds, and to generate an event (i.e. 
        an SNMP notification) if the monitored variable crosses a 
        threshold. The RMON alarm can monitor variables that resolve to 
        an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32, 
        Counter32, Counter64, Gauge32, or TimeTicks), so basically most 
        the variables in [EMAN-MON-MIB]. 
         
         
     9. Relationship with Other Standards Development Organizations 

     9.1. Information Modeling  

        This power management framework should, as much as possible, 
        reuse existing standards efforts, especially with respect to 
        information modeling and data modeling [RFC3444].  
         
        The data model for power, energy related objects is based on IEC 
        61850.   
         
        Specific examples include: 
         
          . The scaling factor, which represents Energy Object usage 
             magnitude, conforms to the IEC 61850 definition of unit 
             multiplier for the SI (System International) units of 
             measure.  
         
          . The electrical characteristic is based on the ANSI and IEC 
             Standards, which require that we use an accuracy class for 
             power measurement.  ANSI and IEC define the following 
             accuracy classes for power measurement:

             . IEC 62053-22  60044-1 class 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1  3.    
             
             . ANSI C12.20 class 0.2, 0.5 
           
          . The electrical characteristics and quality adheres closely 
             to the IEC 61850 7-2 standard for describing AC 
             measurements.   
           
          . The power state definitions are based on the DMTF Power 
             State Profile and ACPI models, with operational state 
             extensions.  
              
         
     10. Security Considerations 

        Regarding the data attributes specified here, some or all may be 
        considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. 
        Reading or writing these attributes without proper protection 
        such as encryption or access authorization may have negative 
        effects on the network capabilities. 
         
         
     10.1. Security Considerations for SNMP 

        Readable objects in a MIB modules (i.e., objects with a MAX-
        ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or 
        vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important 
        to control GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and 
        possibly to encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
        them over the network via SNMP.   
         
        The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment 
        without proper protection can have a negative effect on network 
        operations.  For example: 
         
          . Unauthorized changes to the Power Domain or business 
             context of an Energy Object may result in misreporting or 
             interruption of power. 
          . Unauthorized changes to a power state may disrupt the power 
             settings of the different Energy Objects, and therefore the 
             state of functionality of the respective Energy Objects. 
          . Unauthorized changes to the demand history may disrupt 
             proper accounting of energy usage.  
      
        With respect to data transport SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did 
        not include adequate security.  Even if the network itself is 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 30, 2012           [Page 32] 
         
     Internet-Draft             <EMAN Framework>            Oct 2011 
      
        secure (for example, by using IPsec), there is still no secure 
        control over who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
        GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB 
        modules. 
         
        It is recommended that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 
         
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is not 
        recommended.  Instead, it is recommended to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 
         
         
          
     11. IANA Considerations 

      
        Initial values for the Power State Sets, together with the 
        considerations for assigning them, are defined in [EMAN-MON-
        MIB].
