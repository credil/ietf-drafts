Abstract

   A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data
   structure that represents a cryptographic key.  This specification
   also defines a JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) JSON data structure for
   representing a set of JWKs.  Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers
   for use with this specification are described in the separate JSON
   Web Algorithms (JWA) specification and IANA registries defined by
   that specification.

Internet-Draft                     JWK                    September 2013


1.  Introduction

   A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627]
   data structure that represents a cryptographic key.  This
   specification also defines a JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) JSON data
   structure for representing a set of JWKs.  Cryptographic algorithms
   and identifiers for use with this specification are described in the
   separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification and IANA
   registries defined by that specification.

   Goals for this specification do not include representing certificate
   chains, representing certified keys, and replacing X.509
   certificates.

   JWKs and JWK Sets are used in the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] and
   JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] specifications.

   Names defined by this specification are short because a core goal is
   for the resulting representations to be compact.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   JSON Web Key (JWK)  A JSON object that represents a cryptographic
      key.

   JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set)  A JSON object that contains an array of
      JWKs as the value of its "keys" member.

   Base64url Encoding  Base64 encoding using the URL- and filename-safe
      character set defined in Section 5 of RFC 4648 [RFC4648], with all
      trailing '=' characters omitted (as permitted by Section 3.2).
      (See Appendix C of [JWS] for notes on implementing base64url
      encoding without padding.)

   Collision Resistant Namespace  A namespace that allows names to be
      allocated in a manner such that they are highly unlikely to
      collide with other names.  Examples of Collision Resistant
      Namespaces include: Domain Names, Object Identifiers (OIDs) as
      defined in the ITU-T X.660 and X.670 Recommendation series, and
      Universally Unique IDentifiers (UUIDs) [RFC4122].  When using an

      administratively delegated namespace, the definer of a name needs
      to take reasonable precautions to ensure they are in control of
      the portion of the namespace they use to define the name.


3.  JSON Web Key (JWK) Format

   A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JSON object containing specific members, as
   specified below.  Those members that are common to multiple key types
   are defined below.

   In addition to the common parameters, each JWK will have members that
   are specific to the kind of key being represented.  These members
   represent the parameters of the key.  Section 5 of the JSON Web
   Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification defines multiple kinds of
   cryptographic keys and their associated members.

   The member names within a JWK MUST be unique; recipients MUST either
   reject JWKs with duplicate member names or use a JSON parser that
   returns only the lexically last duplicate member name, as specified
   in Section 15.12 (The JSON Object) of ECMAScript 5.1 [ECMAScript].

   Additional members MAY be present in the JWK.  If not understood by
   implementations encountering them, they MUST be ignored.  Member
   names used for representing key parameters for different kinds of
   keys need not be distinct.  Any new member name SHOULD either be
   registered in the IANA JSON Web Key Parameters registry Section 7.1
   or be a value that contains a Collision Resistant Namespace.

3.1.  "kty" (Key Type) Parameter

   The "kty" (key type) member identifies the cryptographic algorithm
   family used with the key. "kty" values SHOULD either be registered in
   the IANA JSON Web Key Types registry [JWA] or be a value that
   contains a Collision Resistant Namespace.  The "kty" value is a case
   sensitive string.  Use of this member is REQUIRED.

   A list of defined "kty" values can be found in the IANA JSON Web Key
   Types registry [JWA]; the initial contents of this registry are the
   values defined in Section 5.1 of the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA]
   specification.

   Additional members used with these "kty" values can be found in the
   IANA JSON Web Key Parameters registry Section 7.1; the initial
   contents of this registry are the values defined in Sections 5.2 and
   5.3 of the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification.

3.2.  "use" (Key Use) Parameter

   The "use" (key use) member identifies the intended use of the key.
   Values defined by this specification are:

   o  "sig" (signature or MAC operation)

   o  "enc" (encryption)

   Other values MAY be used.  The "use" value is a case sensitive
   string.  Use of this member is OPTIONAL.

3.3.  "alg" (Algorithm) Parameter

   The "alg" (algorithm) member identifies the algorithm intended for
   use with the key.  The values used in this field are the same as
   those used in the JWS [JWS] and JWE [JWE] "alg" and "enc" header
   parameters; these values can be found in the JSON Web Signature and
   Encryption Algorithms registry [JWA].  Use of this member is
   OPTIONAL.

3.4.  "kid" (Key ID) Parameter

   The "kid" (key ID) member can be used to match a specific key.  This
   can be used, for instance, to choose among a set of keys within a JWK
   Set during key rollover.  The interpretation of the "kid" value is
   unspecified.  When "kid" values are used within a JWK Set, different
   keys within the JWK Set SHOULD use distinct "kid" values.  The "kid"
   value is a case sensitive string.  Use of this member is OPTIONAL.

   When used with JWS or JWE, the "kid" value can be used to match a JWS
   or JWE "kid" header parameter value.

3.5.  "x5u" (X.509 URL) Parameter

   The "x5u" (X.509 URL) member is a URI [RFC3986] that refers to a
   resource for an X.509 public key certificate or certificate chain
   [RFC5280].  The identified resource MUST provide a representation of
   the certificate or certificate chain that conforms to RFC 5280
   [RFC5280] in PEM encoded form [RFC1421].  The key in the first
   certificate MUST match the bare public key represented by other
   members of the JWK.  The protocol used to acquire the resource MUST
   provide integrity protection; an HTTP GET request to retrieve the
   certificate MUST use TLS [RFC2818] [RFC5246]; the identity of the
   server MUST be validated, as per Section 3.1 of HTTP Over TLS
   [RFC2818].  Use of this member is OPTIONAL.

3.6.  "x5t" (X.509 Certificate Thumbprint) Parameter

   The "x5t" (X.509 Certificate Thumbprint) member is a base64url
   encoded SHA-1 thumbprint (a.k.a. digest) of the DER encoding of an
   X.509 certificate [RFC5280].  The key in the certificate MUST match
   the bare public key represented by other members of the JWK.  Use of
   this member is OPTIONAL.

3.7.  "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) Parameter

   The "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) member contains a chain of one or
   more PKIX certificates [RFC5280].  The certificate chain is
   represented as a JSON array of certificate value strings.  Each
   string in the array is a base64 encoded ([RFC4648] Section 4 -- not
   base64url encoded) DER [ITU.X690.1994] PKIX certificate value.  The
   PKIX certificate containing the key value MUST be the first
   certificate.  This MAY be followed by additional certificates, with
   each subsequent certificate being the one used to certify the
   previous one.  The key in the first certificate MUST match the bare
   public key represented by other members of the JWK.  Use of this
   member is OPTIONAL.


4.  JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) Format

   A JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) is a JSON object that contains an array
   of JSON Web Key values as the value of its "keys" member.

   The member names within a JWK Set MUST be unique; recipients MUST
   either reject JWK Sets with duplicate member names or use a JSON
   parser that returns only the lexically last duplicate member name, as
   specified in Section 15.12 (The JSON Object) of ECMAScript 5.1
   [ECMAScript].

   Additional members MAY be present in the JWK Set. If not understood
   by implementations encountering them, they MUST be ignored.
   Parameters for representing additional properties of JWK Sets SHOULD
   either be registered in the IANA JSON Web Key Set Parameters registry
   Section 7.2 or be a value that contains a Collision Resistant
   Namespace.

4.1.  "keys" (JSON Web Key Set) Parameter

   The value of the "keys" (JSON Web Key Set) member is an array of JSON
   Web Key (JWK) values.  Use of this member is REQUIRED.

Internet-Draft                     JWK                    September 2013


5.  String Comparison Rules

   Processing a JWK inevitably requires comparing known strings to
   values in JSON objects.  For example, in checking what the key type
   is, the Unicode string encoding "kty" will be checked against the
   member names in the JWK to see if there is a matching name.

   Comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode strings MUST be
   performed by comparing Unicode code points without normalization as
   specified in the String Comparison Rules in Section 5.3 of [JWS].


6.  Encrypted JWK and Encrypted JWK Set Formats

   JWKs containing non-public key material will need to be encrypted in
   some contexts to prevent the disclosure of private or symmetric key
   values to unintended parties.  The use of an Encrypted JWK, which is
   a JWE with a JWK as its plaintext value, is RECOMMENED for this
   purpose.  The processing of Encrypted JWKs is identical to the
   processing of other JWEs.  A "cty" (content type) header parameter
   value of "JWK" can be used to indicate that the content of the JWE is
   a JWK in contexts where this is useful.

   JWK Sets containing non-public key material will similarly need to be
   encrypted.  The use of an Encrypted JWK Set, which is a JWE with a
   JWK Set as its plaintext value, is RECOMMENED for this purpose.  The
   processing of Encrypted JWK Sets is identical to the processing of
   other JWEs.  A "cty" (content type) header parameter value of
   "JWK-SET" can be used to indicate that the content of the JWE is a
   JWK Set in contexts where this is useful.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The following registration procedure is used for all the registries
   established by this specification.

   Values are registered with a Specification Required [RFC5226] after a
   two-week review period on the [TBD]@ietf.org mailing list, on the
   advice of one or more Designated Experts.  However, to allow for the
   allocation of values prior to publication, the Designated Expert(s)
   may approve registration once they are satisfied that such a
   specification will be published.

   Registration requests must be sent to the [TBD]@ietf.org mailing list
   for review and comment, with an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request
   for access token type: example"). [[ Note to RFC-EDITOR: The name of
   the mailing list should be determined in consultation with the IESG

   and IANA.  Suggested name: jose-reg-review. ]]

   Within the review period, the Designated Expert(s) will either
   approve or deny the registration request, communicating this decision
   to the review list and IANA.  Denials should include an explanation
   and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request
   successful.

   IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Expert(s)
   and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
   list.

7.1.  JSON Web Key Parameters Registry

   This specification establishes the IANA JSON Web Key Parameters
   registry for reserved JWK parameter names.  The registry records the
   reserved parameter name and a reference to the specification that
   defines it.  It also records whether the parameter conveys public or
   private information.  This specification registers the parameter
   names defined in Section 3.  The same JWK parameter name may be
   registered multiple times, provided that duplicate parameter
   registrations are only for algorithm-specific JWK parameters; in this
   case, the meaning of the duplicate parameter name is disambiguated by
   the "kty" value of the JWK containing it.

7.1.1.  Registration Template

   Parameter Name:
      The name requested (e.g., "example").  This name is case
      sensitive.  Names that match other registered names in a case
      insensitive manner SHOULD NOT be accepted.

   Parameter Information Class:
      Registers whether the parameter conveys public or private
      information.  Its value must be one the words Public or Private.

   Change Controller:
      For Standards Track RFCs, state "IETF".  For others, give the name
      of the responsible party.  Other details (e.g., postal address,
      email address, home page URI) may also be included.

   Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document(s) that specify the parameter,
      preferably including URI(s) that can be used to retrieve copies of

8.  Security Considerations

   All of the security issues faced by any cryptographic application
   must be faced by a JWS/JWE/JWK agent.  Among these issues are
   protecting the user's private and symmetric keys, preventing various
   attacks, and helping the user avoid mistakes such as inadvertently
   encrypting a message for the wrong recipient.  The entire list of
   security considerations is beyond the scope of this document, but
   some significant considerations are listed here.

   A key is no more trustworthy than the method by which it was
   received.

   Private and symmetric keys MUST be protected from disclosure to
   unintended parties.  One recommended means of doing so is to encrypt
   JWKs or JWK Sets containing them by using the JWK or JWK Set value as
   the plaintext of a JWE.

   The security considerations in RFC 3447 [RFC3447] and RFC 6030
   [RFC6030] about protecting private and symmetric keys also apply to
   this specification.

   The security considerations in XML DSIG 2.0
   [W3C.CR-xmldsig-core2-20120124], about key representations also apply
   to this specification, other than those that are XML specific.

   The TLS Requirements in [JWS] also apply to this specification.

Appendix A.  Example JSON Web Key Sets

A.1.  Example Public Keys

   The following example JWK Set contains two public keys represented as
   JWKs: one using an Elliptic Curve algorithm and a second one using an
   RSA algorithm.  The first specifies that the key is to be used for
   encryption.  The second specifies that the key is to be used with the
   "RS256" algorithm.  Both provide a Key ID for key matching purposes.
   In both cases, integers are represented using the base64url encoding
   of their big endian representations.  (Long lines are broken are for
   display purposes only.)

Appendix D.  Document History

   [[ to be removed by the RFC editor before publication as an RFC ]]

   -15

   o  Changes to address editorial issues #48, #64, #65, #66, and #91.

   -14

   o  Relaxed language introducing key parameters since some parameters
      are applicable to multiple, but not all, key types.

   -13

   o  Applied spelling and grammar corrections.

   -12

   o  Stated that recipients MUST either reject JWKs and JWK Sets with
      duplicate member names or use a JSON parser that returns only the
      lexically last duplicate member name.

   o  Stated that when "kid" values are used within a JWK Set, different
      keys within the JWK Set SHOULD use distinct "kid" values.

   o  Added optional "x5u" (X.509 URL), "x5t" (X.509 Certificate
      Thumbprint), and "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) JWK parameters.

   o  Added section on Encrypted JWK and Encrypted JWK Set Formats.

   o  Added a Parameter Information Class value to the JSON Web Key
      Parameters registry, which registers whether the parameter conveys
      public or private information.

Internet-Draft                     JWK                    September 2013


   o  Registered "application/jwk+json" and "application/jwk-set+json"
      MIME types and "JWK" and "JWK-SET" typ header parameter values,
      addressing issue #21.

   -10

   o  No changes were made, other than to the version number and date.

   -09

   o  Expanded the scope of the JWK specification to include private and
      symmetric key representations, as specified by
      draft-jones-jose-json-private-and-symmetric-key-00.

   o  Defined that members that are not understood must be ignored.

   -08

   o  Changed the name of the JWK key type parameter from "alg" to "kty"
      to enable use of "alg" to indicate the particular algorithm that
      the key is intended to be used with.

   o  Clarified statements of the form "This member is OPTIONAL" to "Use
      of this member is OPTIONAL".

   o  Referenced String Comparison Rules in JWS.

   o  Added seriesInfo information to Internet Draft references.

   -07

   o  Changed the name of the JWK RSA modulus parameter from "mod" to
      "n" and the name of the JWK RSA exponent parameter from "xpo" to
      "e", so that the identifiers are the same as those used in RFC
      3447.

   -06

   o  Changed the name of the JWK RSA exponent parameter from "exp" to
      "xpo" so as to allow the potential use of the name "exp" for a
      future extension that might define an expiration parameter for
      keys.  (The "exp" name is already used for this purpose in the JWT
      specification.)

   o  Clarify that the "alg" (algorithm family) member is REQUIRED.

   o  Correct an instance of "JWK" that should have been "JWK Set".

Internet-Draft                     JWK                    September 2013


   o  Applied changes made by the RFC Editor to RFC 6749's registry
      language to this specification.

   -05

   o  Indented artwork elements to better distinguish them from the body
      text.

   -04

   o  Refer to the registries as the primary sources of defined values
      and then secondarily reference the sections defining the initial
      contents of the registries.

   o  Normatively reference XML DSIG 2.0 [W3C.CR-xmldsig-core2-20120124]
      for its security considerations.

   o  Added this language to Registration Templates: "This name is case
      sensitive.  Names that match other registered names in a case
      insensitive manner SHOULD NOT be accepted."

   o  Described additional open issues.

   o  Applied editorial suggestions.

   -03

   o  Clarified that "kid" values need not be unique within a JWK Set.

   o  Moved JSON Web Key Parameters registry to the JWK specification.

   o  Added "Collision Resistant Namespace" to the terminology section.

   o  Changed registration requirements from RFC Required to
      Specification Required with Expert Review.

   o  Added Registration Template sections for defined registries.

   o  Added Registry Contents sections to populate registry values.

   o  Numerous editorial improvements.

   -02

   o  Simplified JWK terminology to get replace the "JWK Key Object" and
      "JWK Container Object" terms with simply "JSON Web Key (JWK)" and
      "JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set)" and to eliminate potential confusion
      between single keys and sets of keys.  As part of this change, the

      top-level member name for a set of keys was changed from "jwk" to
      "keys".

   o  Clarified that values with duplicate member names MUST be
      rejected.

   o  Established JSON Web Key Set Parameters registry.

   o  Explicitly listed non-goals in the introduction.

   o  Moved algorithm-specific definitions from JWK to JWA.

   o  Reformatted to give each member definition its own section
      heading.
