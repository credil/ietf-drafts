1. Introduction

   The content desire of users is evolving from most popular to long
   tail personalized content. Typically, the CDNi interface between CDNs
   is a long-haul backbone network where bandwidth is premium. Popular
   content is typically shared by many users and is very amenable to
   caching. A single copy of the content is delivered across CDNi to the
   content cache; the content is delivered to multiple users from the
   content cache. Thus, popular content delivery can be scaled to a
   number of users. On the other hand, long tail personalized content is
   typically not shared by many users and not amenable to caching. Also,
   there is heavy asymmetric usage of the network between peak and quiet
   hours. These create unique bandwidth challenge across CDNi.  This
   document suggests solutions for optimizing delivery of long tail
   personalized content in CDN Interconnection scenarios.

3. Optimizing delivery of long tail personalized content over
   CDN Interconnections

3.1. No Caching in CDNs

   Long tail personalized content is typically not shared by many users
   and not amenable to caching. Avoiding caching in the CDNs has the
   following benefits 1) Better cache utilization 2) Avoid unnecessary

   HTTP redirection. Using content usage analytics tools, the content
   provider determines that the content of interest belongs to the
   category of long tail personalized and not amenable to caching. This
   information is made available in the form of per content URL metadata
   to the uCDN. The example below illustrates how this information can
   be used to avoid caching in the CDNs.

   Referring to the example in Fig. 2, Section 3 [I-D.ietf-cdni-
   framework]; it shows Operator A as the upstream CDN (uCDN) and
   Operator B as the downstream CDN (dCDN), where the former has a
   relationship with a content provider and the latter being the best
   CDN to deliver content to the end-user. Referring to the HTTP example
   in Fig. 3, Section 3.2 [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework]; Step 2: A Request
   Router for Operator A processes the HTTP request and recognizes that
   the end-user is best served directly by the origin server without any
   caching--and so it returns a 302 redirect message for a new URL
   containing the path to the content origin server (the current
   behavior for a cached CDN is to construct a new URL by "stacking"
   Operator B's distinguished CDN-domain on the front of the original
   URL).

3.2. Benefits of HTTP Adaptive Streaming

   Recalling the points we discussed before 1) Long tail personalized
   content is not amenable to caching 2) There is heavy asymmetric usage
   of the network between peak and quiet hours, where the peak hour load
   is much higher than the quiet hour load. These create unique
   bandwidth challenges across CDNi.  HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS),
   which can adapt to network congestion, is ideally suited for
   delivering long tail personalized content. [I-D.krishnan-cdni-tm-has]
   recommends traffic management techniques which can offer the best
   adaptive streaming performance over CDN interconnections.

3.3. Caching in end user device

   Caching in the end user device can be used to address the challenges
   created by streaming delivery of long tail personalized content over
   CDNi. This introduces a new model for long tail personalized content
   delivery. The various components of this model can be defined as 1)
   End user chooses the content to watch 2) The content is downloaded in
   the background and cached in the end user device 3) End user is
   notified of content availability. SDN techniques for CDNi [I-D.shin-
   cdni-request-routing-sdn] can be used to optimize the process of
   caching in the end user device. Using the SDN techniques, which
   involve end-to-end resource awareness, it is possible to predict the
   approximate time at which the content would be available to the end
   user when the end user chooses to watch the content. This model is
   typically applicable for long form content where the overhead in
   managing a background download is justifiable.

   Caching in the end user device can have potential DRM issues which
   can be addressed using the following techniques 1) The content can be
   accessed by the end user only for playback 2) The content has a time

   expiry after which it destructs itself 3) In the case of end user
   device loss, the content destructs itself.
