1.  Introduction

   The IETF RTCWEB effort, part of the WebRTC effort carried out in
   cooperation between the IETF and the W3C, is aimed at specifying a
   protocol suite that is useful for real time multimedia exchange
   between browsers.

   The overall effort is described in the RTCWEB overview document,
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview].  This document focuses on the data
   transport protocos that are used by conforming implementations.

   This protocol suite is designed for WebRTC, and intends to satisfy
   the security considerations described in the WebRTC security
   documents, [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security] and
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch].


2.  Transport and Middlebox specification

2.1.  System-provided interfaces

   The protocol specifications used here assume that the following
   protocols are available to the implementations of the RTCWEB
   protocols:

   o  UDP.  This is the protocol assumed by most protocol elements
      described.

   o  TCP.  This is used for HTTP/WebSockets, as well as for TURN/SSL
      and ICE-TCP.

   For both protocols, this specification assumes the ability to set the
   DSCP code point of the sockets opened on a per-packet basis, in order
   to achieve the prioritizations described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-qos].
   It does not assume that the DSCP codepoints will be honored, and does
   assume that they may be zeroed or changed, since this is a local
   configuration issue.

   If DSCP code points can only be set on a per-socket basis, not per-
   packet, one loses the ability to have the network discriminate
   reliably between classes of traffic sent over the same transport, but
   this does not prevent communication.

   This specification does not assume that the implementation will have
   access to ICMP or raw IP.

2.2.  Middle box related functions

   The primary mechanism to deal with middle boxes is ICE, which is an
   appropriate way to deal with NAT boxes and firewalls that accept
   traffic from the inside, but only from the outside if it's in
   response to inside traffic (simple stateful firewalls).

   In order to deal with situations where both parties are behind NATs
   which perform endpoint-dependent mapping (as defined in [RFC5128]
   section 2.4), TURN [RFC5766] MUST be supported.

   In order to deal with firewalls that block all UDP traffic, TURN
   using TCP between the client and the server MUST be supported, and
   TURN using TLS between the client and the server MUST be supported.

   ICE TCP candidates [RFC6062] MAY be supported; this may allow
   applications to achieve peer-to-peer communication across UDP-
   blocking firewalls, but this also requires use of the SRTP/AVPF/TCP
   profile of RTP.

   The following specifications MUST be supported:

   o  ICE [RFC5245]

   o  TURN, including TURN over TCP[RFC5766].

   TURN over TLS over TCP MAY be supported.  (QUESTION: SHOULD?  MUST?)

   For referring to STUN and TURN servers, this specification depends on
   the STUN URI, [I-D.nandakumar-rtcweb-stun-uri].

   Further discussion of the interaction of RTCWEB with firewalls is
   contained in [I-D.hutton-rtcweb-nat-firewall-considerations].  This
   document makes no requirements on interacting with HTTP proxies or
   HTTP proxy configuration methods.

2.3.  Transport protocols implemented

   For data transport over the RTCWEB data channel
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], RTCWEB implementations support SCTP
   over DTLS over ICE.  This is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps].  Negotiation of this transport in
   SCTP is defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp].

   The setup protocol for RTCWEB data channels is described in
   [I-D.jesup-rtcweb-data-protocol].

   For transport of media, secure RTP is used.  The details of the

   profile of RTP used are described in "RTP Usage"
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage].

   RTCWEB implementations MUST support multiplexing of DTLS and RTP over
   the same port pair, as described in the DTLS_SRTP specification
   [RFC5764], section 5.1.2.  Further separation of the DTLS traffic
   into SCTP and "other" is described in <need reference>.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are enumerated in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security].


5.  Acknowledgements

   This document is based on earlier versions embedded in
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview], which were the results of contributions
   from many RTCWEB WG members.
