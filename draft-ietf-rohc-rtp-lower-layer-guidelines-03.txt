This document describes lower layer guidelines for robust header
compression (ROHC) and the requirements ROHC puts on lower layers.
The purpose of this document is to support the incorporation of robust
header compression algorithms, as specified in the ROHC working group,
into different systems such as those specified by Third Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP), 3GPP Project 2 (3GPP2), European Technical
Standards Institute (ETSI), etc.  This document covers only lower
layer guidelines for compression of RTP/UDP/IP and UDP/IP headers as
specified in [RFC3095].  Both general guidelines and guidelines
specific for cellular systems are discussed in this document.

This document is a product of the Robust Header Compression Working
Group of the IETF.
