Abstract

   RBridge edge nodes currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses
   and their corresponding RBridge edge nodes by observing the data
   packets traversed through. When ingress RBridge receives a data
   packet with its destination address (MAC&VLAN) unknown, the data
   packet is flooded across RBridge domain. When there are more than
   one RBridge ports connected to one bridged LAN, only one of them can
   be designated as AF port for forwarding/receiving traffic for each
   LAN, the rest have to be blocked for that LAN.

   This draft describes why and how directory assisted RBridge edge can
   improve TRILL network scalability in data center environment.

1. Introduction

   Data center networks are different from campus networks in several
   ways, in particular:

   1. Data centers, especially Internet or multi-tenant data centers,
     tend to have large number of hosts with a wide variety of
     applications.
   2. Topology is based on racks and rows.
         Hosts assignment to Servers, Racks, and Rows is orchestrated
          by Server/VM Management system, not at random.
   3. Rapid workload shifting in data centers can accelerate the
     frequency of one physical server being re-loaded with different
     applications. Sometimes, applications re-loaded to one physical
     server at different time can belong to different subnets.
   4. With virtualization, there is an ever-increasing trend to
     dynamically create or delete VMs when demand for resource changes,
     to move VMs from overloaded servers, or to aggregate VMs onto
     fewer servers when demand is light.

   Both 3) and 4) above can lead to hosts in one subnet being placed
   under different locations (racks or rows) or one rack having hosts
   belonging to different subnets.

   This draft describes why and how Data Center TRILL networks can be
   optimized by utilizing a directory assisted approach.

2. Terminology

   Bridge:  IEEE 802.1Q compliant device. In this draft, Bridge is used
             interchangeably with Layer 2 switch.

   DA:     Destination Address

   DC:      Data Center

   EoR:    End of Row switches in data center. Also known as

   Host:    Application running on a physical server or a virtual
             machine. A host usually has at least one IP address and at
             least one MAC address.

   SA:     Source Address

   STP:    Spanning Tree Protocol

   RSTP:    Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol

   ToR:    Top of Rack Switch in data center. It is also known as
             access switches in some data centers.

   VM:     Virtual Machines

3. Impact on RBridge domain of massive number of hosts in Data Center

   It is common for Data Center networks to have multiple tiers of
   switches, e.g. one or two Access Switches for each server rack
   (ToR), aggregation switches for some rows (or EoR switches), and
   some core switches to interconnect the aggregation switches. Many
   aggregation switches deployed in data centers are high port density
   switches. It is not uncommon to see aggregation switches
   interconnecting hundreds of ToR switches.

   multiple edge RBridges and each edge RBridge having hosts from
   different subnets/VLANs, the following problems will occur:

     -   Unnecessary filling of slots in MAC table of edge RBridges, due
        to edge RBridge receiving broadcast traffic (ARP/ND
        broadcast/multicast) from hosts under other edge RBridges that
        are not actually communicating with any hosts attached to the
        RBridge whose table is being unnecessarily filled.

     -   Some edge RBridge ports being blocked for user traffic when
        there are more than one RBridge ports connected to one bridged
        LAN. When there are multiple RBridge ports connected to a
        bridged LAN, only one, i.e. the AF port, can forward/receive
        traffic for that bridged LAN which is normally equivalent to a
        VLAN, the rest have to be blocked for forwarding/receiving
        traffic for that VLAN. When a rack has dual uplinks to two
        different ToR switches, i.e. RBridge Edges, (which is very
        common), some links can't be fully utilized.

     -   Packets being flooded across RBridge domain when their DAs are
        not in ingress RBridge's cache.

   Consider a data center with 1600 server racks. Each server rack has
   at least one ToR switch. The ToR switches are further divided to 8
   groups, with each group being connected by a group of aggregation
   switches.  There could be 4 to 8 aggregation switches in each group
   to achieve load sharing for traffic to/from server racks. If TRILL
   is to be deployed in this data center environment, let's consider
   following two scenarios for the TRILL domain boundary:

      -  Scenario #1: TRILL domain boundary starts at ToR switches:

         If each server rack has one uplink to one ToR, there are 1600
         edge RBridges. If each rack has dual uplinks to two ToR
         switches, then there will be 3200 edge RBridges

         In this scenario, the RBridge domain will have more than 1600
         (or 3200) + 8*4 (or 8*8) nodes, which is quite a large IS-IS
         domain. Even though a mesh IS-IS domain can scale up to
         thousands of nodes, it is very challenging for aggregation
         switches to handle IS-IS link state advertisement among
         hundreds of ports.





Dunbar                  Expires Sept26, 2012                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     Directory Assisted RBridge edge          March 2011


      -  Scenario #2: TRILL domain boundary starts at the aggregation
        switches:

         With the same assumption as before, the number of nodes in
         RBridge domain will be less than 100, and aggregation switches
         don't have to handle IS-IS link state advisements among
         hundreds of ports.

         But in this scenario, there will be multiple RBridge edge ports
         connected to one bridged LAN, which requires only one of them
         being designated as Appointed Forwarder (AF port) for
         forwarding native traffic across RBridge domain for that VLAN,
         while other ports/links being blocked for native frames in that
         VLAN. There is also possibility of loops on the bridged LAN
         attached to RBridge edge ports unless STP/RSTP is running.
         Running traditional Layer 2 STP/RSTP on the bridged LAN in this
         environment may be overkill because the topology among the ToR
         switches and aggregation switches is very simple.

         In addition, the number of MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge Mapping
         entries to be learned and managed by RBridge edge node can be
         very large. In the example above, each edge RBridge has 200
         edge ports facing the ToR switches. If each ToR has 40
         downstream ports facing servers and each server has 10 VMs,
         there could be 200*40*10 = 80000 hosts attached. If all those
         hosts belong to 1600 VLANs (i.e. 50 per VLAN) and each VLAN has
         200 hosts, then under the worst case scenario, the total number
         of MAC&VLAN entries to be learned by the RBridge edge can be
         1600*200=320000, which is very large.

4. Directory Assisted RBridge Edge in DC Environment

   In data center environment, applications placement to servers,
   racks, and rows is orchestrated by Server (or VM) Management
   System(s). I.e. there is a database or multiple ones (distributed
   model) which have the knowledge of where each host is located. If
   that host location information can be fed to RBridge edge nodes, in
   some form of Directory Service, then RBridge edge nodes won't need
   to flood data frames with unknown DA across RBridge domain.

   Avoiding unknown DA flooding to RBridge domain is especially
   valuable in data center environment because there is higher chance
   of an RBridge edge receiving packets with unknown DA and
   broadcast/multicast messages due to VM migration and servers being
   loaded with different applications.  When a VM is moved to a new



Dunbar                  Expires Sept26, 2012                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     Directory Assisted RBridge edge          March 2011


   location or a server is loaded with a new application with different
   IP/MAC addresses, it is more likely that the DA of data packets sent
   out from those hosts are unknown to their attached RBridge edges.
   In addition, gratuitous ARP (IPv4) or Unsolicited Neighbor
   Advertisement (IPv6) sent out from those newly migrated or activated
   hosts have to be flooded to other RBridge edges which have hosts in
   the same subnets.

   The benefits of using directory assistance include:

      -  Avoid flooding unknown DA across RBridge domain. The Directory
        enforced MAC&VLAN <-> RBridgeEdge mapping table can determine
        if a data packet needs to be forwarded across RBridge domain.

         When multiple RBridge edge ports are connected via bridged LAN
         to hosts (servers/VMs), a directory assisted RBridge edge can
         simply drop frames with an unknown DA. It won't need to flood
         those data frames across RBridge domain. Therefore, there is no
         need to designate one Appointed Forwarder among all the RBridge
         Edge ports connected to a bridge LAN, which means that all
         RBridge ports can forward/receive traffic.

      -  Reduce flooding decapsulated Ethernet frames with unknown MAC-
        DA to a bridged LAN connected to RBridge edge ports.

         When an RBridge receives a TRILL frame whose destination
         Nickname matches with its own, the normal procedure is for the
         RBridge to decapsulate the TRILL header and forward the
         decapsulated Ethernet frame to its directly attached bridged
         LAN. If the destination MAC is unknown, the decapsulated
         Ethernet frame is flooded in the LAN. With directory
         assistance, the RBridge edge can determine if DA in a frame
         matches with any hosts attached via the bridged LAN. Therefore,
         frames can be discarded if their DAs do not match.

      -  Reduce the amount of MAC&VLAN <-> RBridgeEdge mapping
        maintained by RBridge edge. There is no need for an RBridge
        edge to keep the MAC entries for hosts which don't communicate
        with hosts attached to the RBridge edge.

   There can be two different models for RBridge edge node to be
   assisted by Directory Service: Push Model and Pull Model.

Internet-Draft     Directory Assisted RBridge edge          March 2011


   4.1. Push Model

   Under this model, Directory Server(s) push down the MAC&VLAN <->
   RBridgeEdge mapping for all the hosts which might communicate with
   hosts attached to an RBridge edge node. The mapping entry to be
   pushed down could leverage the gratuitous ARP reply with extended
   fields showing the edge RBridge's name, as shown in Table 2. Using
   Table 2 requires one entry per host. When directory pushes down the
   entire mapping to an edge RBridge for the very first time, there
   usually are many entries. To minimize the number of entries pushed
   down, summarization should be considered, e.g. with one edge RBridge
   Nickname being associated with all attached hosts' MAC addresses and
   VLANs as shown below:

      +------------+-------+--------------------------------+
      | Nickname1  |VID-1  | MAC1, MAC2, ..MACn             |
      |            |------ +--------------------------------+
      |            |VID-2  | MAC1, MAC2, ..MACn             |
      |            |------ +--------------------------------+
      |            |...     | MAC1, MAC2, ...MACn                |
       +-------------+--------+------------------------------------+
       | Nickname2   |VID-1   | MAC1, MAC2, ...MACn                |
       |             |------- +------------------------------------+
       |             |VID-2   | MAC1, MAC2, ...MACn                |
       |             |------- +------------------------------------+
       |             |...     | MAC1, MAC2, .. MACn                |
       +-------------+------- +------------------------------------+
       | -------     |------- +------------------------------------+
       |             |....    | MAC1, MAC2, ... MACn               |
       +-------------+------- +------------------------------------+
            Table 1: Summarized table pushed down from directory

   Whenever there is any change in MAC&VLAN <-> RBridgeEdge mapping,
   which can be triggered by hosts being added, moved, or de-
   commissioned, an incremental update can be sent to the RBridge edges
   which are impacted by the change.

   Under this model, it is recommended that RBridge edge simply drop a
   data packet (instead of flooding to RBridge domain) if the packet's
   destination address can't be found in the MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge
   mapping table.

   It may not be necessary for every RBridge edge to get the entire
   mapping table for all the hosts in a data center. There are many
   ways to narrow the full set down to a smaller set of remote hosts
   which communicate with hosts attached to an RBridge edge. A simple
   approach of only pushing down the mapping for the VLANs which have

Internet-Draft     Directory Assisted RBridge edge          March 2011


   active hosts under an RBridge edge can reduce the number of mapping
   entries pushed down.

   However, it is inevitable that RBridge edge's MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge
   mapping table will have more entries than they really need under the
   Push Model. When hosts attached to one RBridge Edge rarely
   communicate with hosts attached to different RBridge edges even
   though they are on the same VLAN, the normal process of RBridge
   edge's unknown DA flooding, learning and cache aging would have
   removed those MAC&VLAN entries from the RBridge's cache. But it can
   be difficult for Directory Servers to predict the communication
   patterns among hosts within one VLAN. Therefore, it is likely that
   the Directory Servers will push down all the MAC&VLAN entries if
   there are hosts in the VLAN being attached to the RBridge Edge.

   4.2. Pull model:

   Under this model, ''RBridge'' pulls the MAC&VLAN<->RBridge mapping
   entry from the directory server when needed. RBridge edge node can
   simply intercept all ARP/ND requests and frames with unknown DA, and
   forward them to the Directory Server(s) that has the information on
   where each host is located.

   The reply from the Directory Server can be the standard ARP/ND reply
   with an extra field showing the RBridge egress node's Nickname, as
   depicted in Table 2. RBridge ingress node can cache the mapping.

   If RBridge edge node receives a data packet with unknown MAC-DA, it
   can query the directory server. If there is no response from the
   directory server, the RBridge edge node can drop the packet.

   One advantage of the Pull Model is that RBridge edge can age out
   MAC&VLAN entries if they haven't been used for a certain period of
   time. Therefore, each RBridge edge will only keep the entries which
   are frequently used, i.e. mapping table size can be smaller. RBridge
   edge would query the Directory Server(s) for unknown DAs in data
   frames or ARP/ND and cache the response. When hosts attached to one
   RBridge Edge rarely communicate with hosts attached to different
   RBridge edges even though they are on the same VLAN, the
   corresponding MAC&VLAN entries would be aged out from the RBridge's
   cache.

   The following table shows how target RBridge nickname can be
   attached to a standard ARP Reply when replying to an ARP request
   forwarded by ingress RBridge edge.

            Table 2: Extended fields added to standard ARP reply

   The original ARP reply format consists of the first 28 octets shown
   in this table. The last 12 octets in this table marked by ''->'' are
   extended fields to indicate the Ingress RBridge to which originating
   host is attached and the Egress RBridge to which the target host is
   attached. More bits are reserved for RBridge nicknames in case
   multiple levels of nicknames are needed in the future for large data
   centers.

5. Conclusion and Recommendation

    The traditional RBridge learning approach of observing data plane
    can no longer keep pace with the ever growing number of hosts in
    Data center.

    Therefore, we suggest TRILL consider directory assisted
    approach(es). This draft only introduces the basic concept of using
    directory assisted approach for RBridge edge nodes to learn the
    MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping. More complete mechanisms will be
    developed after the working group reaches some level of consensus.
