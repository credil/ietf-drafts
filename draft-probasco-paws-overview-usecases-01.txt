  Protocol to Access White Space database: Use cases and requirements
                draft-probasco-paws-overview-usecases-01

Abstract

   Wireless spectrum is a commodity that is regulated by governments.
   The spectrum is used for various purposes which include entertainment
   (eg. radio and television), communication (telephony and Internet
   access), military (radars etc.) and, navigation (satellite
   communication, GPS).  Portions of the radio spectrum that are unused
   or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as "white
   space".  TV White space refers to those unused channels, within the
   range allocated for TV transmission, that can be used without
   interfering with the primary purpose for which it is allocated.

   This document describes examples of how a radio system might operate
   using TV white space spectrum and associated requirements.  Not only
   does it describe the operation of a radio system, but also how the
   radio system including a white space database enables additional
   services.

1.  Introduction

   Wireless spectrum is a commodity that is regulated by governments.
   The spectrum is used for various purposes which include entertainment
   (eg. radio and television), communication (telephony and Internet
   access), military (radars etc.) and, navigation (satellite
   communication, GPS).  Additionally spectrum is allocated for use
   either on a license basis or for unlicensed use.  Television
   transmission until now has primarily been analog.  The switch to
   digital transmission has begun.  As a result the spectrum allocated
   for television transmission can now be more effectively used.  Unused
   channels and bands between channels can be used as long as they do
   not interfere with the primary service for which that channel is
   allocated.  While urban areas tend to have dense usage of spectrum
   and a number of TV channels, the same is not true in rural and semi-
   urban areas.  There can be a number of unused TV channels in such
   areas that can be used for other services.  The figure below shows TV
   white space within the lower UHF band:

   Regulatory entities in several countries including the US, Canada,
   UK, Finland to name a few are specifying the regulations for the use
   of TV white space.  The availability of TV white space opens up the
   potential for its use for various purposes.  Regulation may mandate
   its use for certain specific applications or services.

   This document describes an example of how a radio system might
   operate using TV white space spectrum.  Not only does it describe the
   operation of a radio system for providing Internet access at a hot
   spot or in a rural area, but also how the radio system including a
   white space database enables location based services.  The
   description is high level and generic, it is not meant to be specific

   to any particular radio technology.

2.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   The Terminology Section of the latest version of
   draft-patil-paws-problem-stmt [PAWS-PS] shall be included by
   reference.

   Location Based Service

      An application or device which provides data, information or
      service to a user based on their location.

   Master Device

      A device which queries the WS Database to find out the available
      operating channels.

   Slave Device

      A device which uses the spectrum made available by a master
      device.


3.  Use cases

   There are many potential use cases that could be considered for the
   TV white space spectrum.  Providing broadband internet access in hot
   spots, rural and underserved areas are examples.  Available channels
   may also be used to provide internet 'backhaul' for traditional Wi-Fi
   hot spots, or by towns and cities to monitor/control traffic lights
   or read utility meters.  Still other use cases include the ability to
   offload data traffic from another internet access network (e.g. 3G
   cellular network) or to deliver location based services.  Some of
   these use cases are described in the following sections.

Internet-Draft               PAWS: Use Cases                   July 2011


3.1.  TVWS database discovery

   This use case is preliminary to creating a radio network using TV
   white space; it is a prerequisite to other use cases.  The radio
   network is created by a master device which can be an access point
   that establishes Hot Spot coverage, a base station that establish
   cellular coverage, or a device that establishes a peer-to-peer or ad-
   hoc network.  Before the master device can trasmit in TV white space
   spectrum, it must contact a trusted database where the device can
   learn if any channels are available for it to use.

   In the simplest case the radio device is pre-programmed with the
   internet address of at least one trusted database.  The device can
   establish contact with a trusted database using one of the pre-
   programmed internet addresses and establish a TV white space network
   (as described in one of the following use cases).

   If the radio device (master) does not have a pre-programmed address
   for a trusted white space database, or if the trusted database at the
   pre-programmed address is not responsive, or perhaps the trusted
   database does not provide service for the radio device's current
   location, or at the user's choice, the device may attempt to
   "discover" a trusted database which provides service at the current
   location.

   1.  The master is connected to the internet by any means other than
       using the TV white space radio.

   2.  The master constructs and broadcasts a query message over the
       internet and waits for responses.

   3.  If no acceptable response is received within a pre-configured
       time limit, the device concludes that no trusted database is
       available.  If one or more response is received, the device
       evaluates the response to determine if a trusted database can be
       identified where the device is able to register and receive
       service from the database.

3.2.  Hot-Spot: urban internet connectivity service

   In this use case internet connectivity service is provided in a "hot
   spot" to local users.  Typical deployment scenarios include urban
   areas where internet connectivity is provided to local businesses and
   residents, and campus environments where internet connectivity is
   provided to local buildings and relatively small outdoor areas.  This
   deployment scenario is typically characterized by multiple masters
   (APs or hot spots) in close proximity, with low antenna height, cells
   with relatively small radius (a few kilometers or less), and limited



Probasco, et al.        Expires January 13, 2012                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               PAWS: Use Cases                   July 2011


   numbers of available radio channels.  Many of the masters/APs are
   assumed to be individually deployed and operated, i.e. there is no
   coordination between many of the masters/APs.  The masters/APs in
   this scenario use a TDD radio technology and transmit at or below a
   relatively low transmit power threshold.  Each master/AP has a
   connection to the internet and provides internet connectivity to
   multiple end user or slave devices.

   The figure below shows an example deployment of this scenario.

         Figure 2: Hot-spot service using TV white space spectrum

   Once a master/AP has been correctly installed and configured, a
   simplified power up and operation scenario utilizing TV White Space
   to provide Internet connectivity service consists of the following
   steps:

   1.  The master/AP powers up; however its WS radio and all other WS
       capable devices will power up in idle/listen only mode (no active
       transmissions on the WS frequency band).

   2.  The master/AP has Internet connectivity and establishes a
       connection to a trusted white space database (see use case "TVWS
       database discovery" above).

   3.  The master/AP registers its geolocation, address, contact
       information, etc. associated with the owner/operator of the
       master/AP with the trusted database administrator (if not
       currently registered).  Depending upon local regulator policy,
       the DB administrator may be required to store and forward the
       registration information to the regulatory authority.

Internet-Draft               PAWS: Use Cases                   July 2011


   4.  Following the registration process, the master/AP will send a
       query to the trusted database requesting a list of available WS
       channels based upon its geolocation.

   5.  If the master/AP has been previously authenticated, the database
       responds with a list of available white space channels that the
       master may use, and optionally a duration of time for their use.

   6.  Once the master/AP authenticates the WS channel list response
       message from the database, the AP selects an available WS
       channel(s) from the list.

   7.  The master/AP acknowledges to the database which of the available
       WS channels it has selected for its operation.  The database is
       updated with the information provided by the master/AP.

   8.  The slave or user device scans the TV bands to locate a master/AP
       transmission, and associates with the AP.  The slave/user device
       queries the master for a channel list, based on the slaves'
       geolocation.

   9.  The master provides the list of channels locally available to the
       slave/user device.  If the channel that the user terminal is
       currently using is not included in the list of locally available
       channels, the slave/user device ceases all operation on its
       current channel.  The slave/user device may scan for another AP
       transmission on a different channel.

3.3.  Wide-Area or Rural internet broadband access

   In this use case internet broadband access is provided as a Wide-Area
   Network (WAN) or Wireless Regional Area Netwowk (WRAN).  A typical
   deployment scenario is a wide area or rural area, where internet
   broadband access is provided to local businesses and residents from a
   master (i.e.  BS) connected to the internet.  This deployment
   scenario is typically characterized by one or more fixed master(s)/
   BS(s), cells with relatively large radius (tens kilometers up to 100
   km), and many available radio channels.  Many of the masters/BSs are
   assumed to be deployed and operated by a single entity, i.e. there is
   coordination between many of the masters/BSs.  The BS in this
   scenario use a TDD radio technology and transmit at or below a
   transmit power threshold established by the local regulator.  Each
   base station has a connection to the internet and provides internet
   connectivity to multiple slave/end-user devices.  End user terminals
   or devices may be fixed or portable.

   The figure below shows an example deployment of this scenario.

      Figure 3: Rural internet broadband access using TV white space
                                 spectrum

   Once the master/BS has been professionally installed and configured,
   a simplified power up and operation scenario utilizing TV White Space
   to provide rural internet broadband access consists of the following
   steps:

   1.  The master/BS powers up; however its WS radio and all other WS
       capable devices will power up in idle/listen only mode (No active
       transmissions on the WS frequency band)

   2.  The master/BS has internet connectivity and establishes a
       connection to a trusted white space database (see use case "TVWS
       database discovery" above).

   3.  The master/BS registers its geolocation, address, contact
       information, etc. associated with the owner/operator of the
       master/BS with the trusted database service (if not currently
       registered).  Meanwhile the DB administrator may be required to
       store and forward the registration information to the regulatory
       authority.  If a trusted white space database administrator is
       not discovered, further operation of the WRAN may be allowed
       according to local regulator policy (in this case operation of
       the WRAN is outside the scope of the PAWS protocol).

   4.  Following the registration process, the master/BS will send a
       query to the trusted database requesting a list of available WS
       channels based upon its geolocation.

   5.  If the master/BS has been previously authenticated, the database
       responds with a list of available white space channels that may
       be used and optionally a maximum transmit power (EIRP) for each
       channel and a duration of time the channel may be used.

Internet-Draft               PAWS: Use Cases                   July 2011


   6.  Once the master/BS authenticates the WS channel list response
       message from the database, the master/BS selects an available WS
       channel(s) from the list.  The operator may disallow some
       channels from the list to suit local needs if required.

   7.  The master/BS acknowledges to the database which of the available
       WS channels the BS has selected for its operation.  The database
       is updated with the information provided by the BS.

   8.  The slave or user device scans the TV bands to locate a WRAN
       transmission, and associates with the master/BS.  The slave/user
       device queries the master for a channel list, based on the
       slaves' geolocation.

   9.  The master provides the list of channels locally availabe to the
       slave/user device.  If the channel that the user terminal is
       currently using is not included in the list of locally available
       channels, the slave/user device ceases all operation on its
       current channel.  The slave/user device may scan for another WRAN
       transmission on a different channel.

3.4.  Offloading: moving traffic to a white space network

   In this use case internet connectivity service is provided over TV
   white space as a supplemental or alternative datapath to a 3G or
   other internet connection.  In a typical deployment scenario an end
   user has a primary internet connection such as a 3G cellular packet
   data subscription.  The user wants to use a widget or application to
   stream video from an online service (e.g. youtube) to their device.
   Before the widget starts the streaming connection it checks
   connectivity options available at the current time and location.
   Both 3G cellular data is available as well as TVWS connectivity (the
   user is within coverage of a TVWS master -- hot spot, WAN, WRAN or
   similar).  The user may decide for many and various reasons such as
   cost, RF coverage, data caps, etc... to prefer the TVWS connection
   over the 3G cellular data connection.  Either by user selection,
   preconfigured preferences, or other algorithm, the streaming session
   is started over the TVWS internet connection instead of the 3G
   cellular connection.  This deployment scenario is typically
   characterized by a TVWS master/AP providing local coverage in the
   same geographical area as a 3G cellular system.  The master/AP is
   assumed to be individually deployed and operated, i.e. the master/AP
   is deployed and operated by the user at his home or perhaps by a
   small business such as a coffee shop.  The master/AP has a connection
   to the internet and provides internet connectivity to the slave/
   end-user's device.

   The figure below shows an example deployment of this scenario.

       Figure 4: Offloading: moving traffic to a white space network

   Once a dual or multi mode device (3G + TVWS) is connected to a 3G
   network, a simplified operation scenario of offloading selected
   content such as video stream from the 3G connection to the TWVS
   connection consists of the following steps:

   1.  The dual mode (or multi mode) device (3G + TVWS) is connected to
       a 3G network.  The device has contacted a trusted database to
       discover the list of available TV channels at is current
       location.  The device has located a TVWS master/AP operating on
       an available channel and has associated or connected with the
       TVWS master/AP.

   2.  The user activates a widget or application that streams video
       from YouTube.  The widget connects to YouTube over 3G cellular
       data.  The user browses content and searches for video
       selections.

   3.  The user selects a video for streaming using the widget's
       controls.  Before the widget initiates a streaming session, the
       widget checks the available connections in the dual mode device
       and finds a TVWS master/AP is connected.

   4.  Using either input from the user or pre-defined profile
       preferences, the widget selects the TVWS master/AP as the

       connection to stream the video.

3.5.  TVWS for backhaul

   In this use case internet connectivity service is provided to users
   over a traditional wireless protocol, one common example is Wi-Fi.
   The TV white space network provides the "backhaul" or connection from
   the Wi-Fi to the internet.  In a typical deployment scenario an end
   user has a device with a radio such as Wi-Fi.  A service provider or
   shop owner wants to provide Wi-Fi internet service for their
   customers.  The location where the service provider wants to provide
   Wi-Fi is within range of a TVWS master (e.g.  Hot-Spot or Wide-Area/
   Rural network).  The service provider installs a TVWS slave device
   and connect this slave to a Wi-Fi access point.  This deployment
   scenario is typically characterized by a TVWS master/AP/BS providing
   local coverage.  The master/AP has a connection to the internet and
   provides internet connectivity to the slave device.  The slave device
   is then 'bridged' to a Wi-Fi network

   The figure below shows an example deployment of this scenario.

                        Figure 5: TVWS for backhaul

   Once the bridged device (TVWS+WiFi) is connected to a master and TVWS
   network, a simplified operation scenario of backhaul for WiFi
   consists of the following steps:

   1.  A bridged device (TVWS+WiFi) is connected to a master device
       operating in the TVWS.  The bridged device operates as a slave
       device in either Hot-Spot or Wide-Area/Rural internet use cases
       described above.

   2.  Once the slave device is connected to the master, the Wi-Fi
       access point configures its internet settings automatically based
       on the backhaul connection (i.e. it uses DHCP).

   3.  End users connect their WiFi device to the bridged device and
       receive internet connectivity.

3.6.  Location based service usage scenario

   The owner of a shopping mall wants to provide internet access to
   customers when they are at the shopping mall.  His internet service
   provider (ISP) recommends using master/AP devices in the TV white
   space frequency band since these radios will have good propagation
   characteristics, and thus will require fewer devices, and also
   because the frequency band used by traditional Wi-Fi is crowded with
   users such as individual stores operating their own Wi-Fi network and
   also Bluetooth devices.  The ISP installs APs in each large store in
   the mall, and several other APs throughout the mall building.  For
   each AP, the professional installer programs the location (latitude
   and longitude) of the device.  Special tools are required to
   determine the location, since typical GPS receivers do not function
   indoors.  When each AP is powered on, the radio does not transmit
   initially.  The AP contacts a white space database, using its wired
   internet connection, via a URL and provides its programmed location
   coordinates plus other information required by the database.  A reply
   is received by the AP from the database containing a list of
   available channels where the AP can operate its transmitter.  The AP
   selects a channel for operation and notifies the database, which
   records information about the AP including the identity of the AP and
   its location coordinates.  The AP activates its radio and begins to
   function as a typical wireless AP, providing internet access to
   connected devices.

   A user has a slave device that is capable of operating in the TV
   white spaces frequency band.  A typical device would be a smartphone
   with multiple radios, including a cellular radio, a Wi-Fi radio, and
   TV white space radio.  The user arrives at the shopping mall and
   enters the building.  The white space radio in the smartphone is on,
   and is scanning for a master/AP.  As the user gets near the entrance
   to the shopping mall, the smartphone locates one of the APs in the
   building and connects to it.  The smartphone begins to use this TVWS
   radio for internet access.  This internet access does not count
   against the users cellular data cap (the mall owner is providing the
   internet access) and also the data rates are better than cellular
   data.  As the user walks throughout the mall the smartphone moves
   between coverage of different APs, and the smartphone connects to a
   new AP when the user and smartphone move near it.

Internet-Draft               PAWS: Use Cases                   July 2011


   In order to encourage customers to come to the shopping mall, the
   mall owner has a loyalty program where members register, build
   points, and receive coupons and other notices from the shops in the
   mall.  Before installing the internet service in the mall, all
   loyalty program information was mailed to the user, at an address
   which was provided by the user when joining the loyalty program.

   The ISP provider describes to the mall owner how the loyalty program
   can be improved using the internet service provided by the APs in the
   TV white space.  A new app is developed for this loyalty program, and
   promoted to users, asking them to install the app on their
   smartphone.  The app is provisioned with the user's loyalty program
   information.  When the user comes to the shopping mall, the
   smartphone locates the master/AP providing internet service and
   connects to the AP.  The app in the smartphone sees that a radio
   connection to an AP in the TV white space frequency band is now
   active.  The app registers the identity of the AP and forwards this
   to the home server for the loyalty program, using the internet
   connection provided by the AP in the TV white space band.  The
   loyalty program server registers the identity of the user from the
   loyalty program credentials and also the identity of the AP.  Next
   the loyalty program server contacts the TV white space database and
   requests the location of the master/AP having the identity forwarded
   by the app and smartphone.  When the TV white space database replies
   with the location coordinates of the AP, the loyalty program server
   knows the approximate location of the user and smartphone.  With this
   location information, the loyalty program server can now forward
   loyalty program information to the user.  As the user moves through
   the mall, the smartphone connects to different APs.  The process is
   repeated, allowing the loyalty program to delivery current location
   based information to the user.

   1.  The master create a TVWS network as described in use case "Hot-
       Spot: urband internet connectivity service."

   2.  An application running on the user's slave device (e.g.
       smartphone) determines that a network connection exists in the
       TVWS band.  The identify of the master/AP is recorded by the
       application and forwarded to a server in the internet cloud.

   3.  The server queries the trusted white space database with the
       master identity provided by the application in the user's
       smartphone.

   4.  The trusted white space database replies to the server with the
       location of the master device.

   5.  The server uses the location of the master/AP to determine the
       approximate location of the user's smartphone.  The server
       provides location-specific service to the user via the
       application running in the smartphone.


4.  Requirements

4.1.  Master

   1.  A master device MUST include, directly or indirectly, its antenna
       height in the query to the WS Database.

   2.  A master device MUST query the WS Database for the available
       channels at least once a day to verify that the operating
       channels continue to remain available.

   3.  A master device MUST determine its location with at least =/-50
       meters accuracy and MUST place that location into the query it
       makes to the WS Database.

   4.  A master device MAY indicate the accuracy by which it determined
       its location in the query to the WS Database.

   5.  A master device which changes its location during operation MUST
       query the WS Database for available operating channels each time
       it moves more than 100 meters from the location it previously
       made the query.

   6.  A master device MUST be able to receive channel availability
       updates from a WS Database.

   7.  A master device MUST be able to query the WS Database for channel
       availability information for multiple locations.

   8.  A master device MUST be able to query the WS Database for channel
       availability information for a specific area around its current

4.3.  Security

   1.  The protocol between the master device and the WS Database MUST
       support mutual authentication and authorization.

   2.  The protocol between the master device and the WS Database MUST
       support integrity and confidentiality protection.

   3.  The WS Database MUST support both username/password and digital
       certificates based authentication of the master device.

   4.  A master device MUST be capable to validate the digital
       certificate of the WS Database.

   5.  A master device MUST be capable to check the validity of the WS
       Database certificate and whether it has been revoked or not.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no requests to IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   The messaging interface between the master and the database must be
   secure to ensure confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of the
   data exchanged between devices.  A master queries a database with
   information which identifies owner/operator of the device and also
   the location of the device.  Such information can reasonably
   considered to be sensitive information which must remain
   confidential.  A well-functioning white space network relies upon
   trusted devices exchanging trusted information, thus each participant
   in the protocol exchange must be authenticated.  A white space
   network must ensure the protection of the primary user of the radio
   spectrum, therefore the integrity of the message exchange must be
   ensured.


7.  Summary and Conclusion

   The document describes some examples of the role of the white space
   database in the operation of a radio network and also shows an
   examples of a services provided to the user of a TVWS device.  From
   these use cases requirements are determined.  These requirements are
   to be used as input to the definition of a Protocol to Access White
   Space database (PAWS).
