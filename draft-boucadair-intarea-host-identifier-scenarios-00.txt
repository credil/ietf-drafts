Internet-Draft              Host ID Use Cases               October 2012


1.  Introduction

   The ultimate goal of this document is to enumerate scenarios which
   encounter the issue of uniquely identifying a host among those
   sharing the same IP address.  Examples of encountered issues are:

   o  Blacklist a misbehaving host without impacting all hosts sharing
      the same IP address.

   o  If a remote server enforces a policy to limit access to the
      service (based on some counters), the policy will have impact on
      all hosts sharing the same IP address.

   o  If access to a service has failed (e.g., wrong login/passwd), all
      hosts sharing the same IP address may not be able to access that
      service.

   It is out of scope of this document to list all the encountered
   issues as this is already covered in [RFC6269].

   The generic concept of host identifier, denoted as HOST_ID, is
   defined in [I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis].


2.  Scope

   It is out of scope of this document to argue in favor or against the
   use cases listed in the following sub-sections.  The goal is to
   identify scenarios the authors are aware of and which share the same
   issue of host identification.

   This document does not include any solution-specific discussion.
   This document can be used as a tool to design solution(s) mitigating
   the encountered issues.  Having a generic solution which would solve
   the issues encountered in these use cases is preferred over designing
   a solution for each use case.  Describing the use case allows to
   identify what is common between the use cases and then would help
   during the solution design phase.

   The first version of the document does not elaborate whether explicit
   authentication is enabled or not.


3.  Use Case 1: CGN

   Several flavors of stateful CGN have been defined.  A non-exhaustive
   list is provided below:

   1.  NAT44

   2.  DS-Lite NAT44 [RFC6333]

   3.  NAT64 [RFC6146]

   4.  NPTv6 [RFC6296]

   As discussed in [I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis], remote
   servers are not able to distinguish between hosts sharing the same IP
   address (Figure 1).
    +-----------+
    |  HOST_1   |----+
    +-----------+    |        +--------------------+      +------------+
                     |        |                    |------|  server 1  |
    +-----------+  +-----+    |                    |      +------------+
    |  HOST_2   |--| CGN |----|      INTERNET      |            ::
    +-----------+  +-----+    |                    |      +------------+
                      |       |                    |------|  server n  |
    +-----------+     |       +--------------------+      +------------+
    |  HOST_3   |-----+
    +-----------+


                                 Figure 1


4.  Use Case 2: A+P

   A+P [RFC6346] denotes a flavor of address sharing solutions which
   does not require any additional NAT function be enabled in the
   service provider's network.  A+P assumes subscribers are assigned
   with the same IPv4 address together with a port set.  Subscribers
   assigned with the same IPv4 address should be assigned non
   overlapping port sets.  Devices connected to an A+P-enabled network
   should be able to restrict the IPv4 source port to be within a
   configure range of ports.  To forward incoming packets to the
   appropriate host, a dedicated entity called PRR (Port Range Router,
   [RFC6346]) is needed (Figure 2).

   Similar to the CGN case, the same issue to identify hosts sharing the
   same IP address is encountered by remote servers.

    |  HOST_1   |----+
    +-----------+    |        +--------------------+      +------------+
                     |        |                    |------|  server 1  |

                      |       |                    |------|  server n  |

    +-----------+


                                 Figure 2


5.  Use Case 3: Application Proxies

   This scenario is similar to the CGN scenario.  Remote servers are not
   able to distinguish hosts located behind the PROXY.  Applying
   policies on the perceived external IP address as received from the
   PROXY will impact all hosts connected to that PROXY.

   Figure 3 illustrates a simple configuration involving a proxy.  Note
   several (per-application) proxies may be deployed.

    +-----------+
    |  HOST_1   |----+
    +-----------+    |        +--------------------+      +------------+
                     |        |                    |------|  server 1  |
    +-----------+  +-----+    |                    |      +------------+
    |  HOST_2   |--|PROXY|----|      INTERNET      |            ::
    +-----------+  +-----+    |                    |      +------------+
                      |       |                    |------|  server n  |
    +-----------+     |       +--------------------+      +------------+
    |  HOST_3   |-----+
    +-----------+


                                 Figure 3


6.  Use Case 4: Open Wi-Fi or Provider Wi-Fi

   In the context of Provider Wi-Fi (also called Open Wi-Fi or FMC
   scenario), a dedicated SSID can be configured and advertised by a CPE
   for visiting terminals.  These visiting terminals can be mobile
   terminals, PCs, etc.



Boucadair, et al.        Expires April 14, 2013                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              Host ID Use Cases               October 2012


   Several deployment scenarios are envisaged:

   1.  Deploy a dedicated node in the service provider's network which
       will be responsible to intercept all the traffic issued from
       visiting terminals (see Figure 4).  This node may be co-located
       with a CGN function if private IPv4 addresses are assigned to
       visiting terminals.  Similar to the CGN case discussed in
       Section 3, remote servers may not be able to distinguish visiting
       hosts sharing the same IP address (see [RFC6269]).

   2.  Unlike the previous deployment scenario, IPv4 addresses are
       managed by the CPE without requiring any additional NAT to be
       deployed in the service provider's network for handling traffic
       issued from visiting terminals.  Concretely, a visiting terminal
       is assigned with a private IPv4 address from the pool managed by
       the CPE.  Packets issued form a visiting terminal are translated
       using the public IP address assigned to the CPE (see Figure 5).
       This deployment scenario induces the following identification
       concerns:

       *  The provider is not able to distinguish the traffic belonging
          to the visiting terminal from the traffic of the subscriber
          owning the CPE.  This is needed to apply some policies such
          as: accounting, DSCP remarking, black list, etc.

       *  Similar to the CGN case Section 3, a misbehaving visiting
          terminal is likely to have some impact on the experienced
          service by the customer owning the CPE (e.g., some of the
          issues are discussed in [RFC6269]).

7.  Use Case 5: Policy and Charging Control Architecture

   This issue is related to the framework defined in [TS.23203] when a
   NAT is located between the PCEF (Policy and Charging Enforcement
   Function) and the AF (Application Function) as shown in Figure 6.

   The main issue is: PCEF, PCRF and AF all receive information bound to
   the same UE but without being able to correlate between the piece of
   data visible for each entity.  Concretely,

   o  PCEF is aware of the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber
      Identity) and an internal IP address assigned to the UE.

   o  AF receives an external IP address and port as assigned by the NAT
      function.

   o  PCRF is not able to correlate between the external IP address/port
      assigned by the NAT and the internal IP address and IMSI of the
      UE.

                             +------+
                             | PCRF |-----------------+
                             +------+                 |
                                |                     |
                 +----+      +------+   +-----+    +-----+
                 | UE |------| PCEF |---| NAT |----|  AF |
                 +----+      +------+   +-----+    +-----+

                                 Figure 6

   This scenario can be generalized as follows (Figure 7):

   o  Policy Enforcement Point (PEP, [RFC2753])

   o  Policy Decision Point (PDP, [RFC2753])

                             +------+
                             | PDP  |-----------------+
                             +------+                 |
                                |                     |
                 +----+      +------+   +-----+    +------+
                 |Host|------| PEP  |---| NAT |----|Server|
                 +----+      +------+   +-----+    +------+

                                 Figure 7


8.  Use Case 6: Cellular Networks

   Cellular operators allocate private IPv4 addresses to mobile
   customers and deploy NAT44 function, generally co-located with
   firewalls, to access to public IP services.  The NAT function is
   located at the boundaries of the PLMN.  IPv6-only strategy,
   consisting in allocating IPv6 prefixes only to customers, is
   considered by various operators.  A NAT64 function is also considered
   in order to preserve IPv4 service continuity for these customers.

   These NAT44 and NAT64 functions bring some issues very similar to
   those mentioned in Figure 1 and Section 7.  This issue is
   particularly encountered if policies are to be applied on the Gi
   interface: a private IP address may be assigned to several UEs, no
   correlation between the internal IP address and the address:port
   assigned by the NAT function, etc.


9.  Security Considerations

   This document does not define an architecture nor a protocol; as such
   it does not raise any security concern.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action from IANA.
