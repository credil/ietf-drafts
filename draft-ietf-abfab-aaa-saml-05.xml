                This document specifies a RADIUS attribute, a binding, a name identifier format, 
		two profiles, and two confirmation methods for the 
		Security Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML). The attribute provides RADIUS 
		encapsulation of SAML protocol messages, and the binding describes the use of
		this attribute, and the SAML protocol messages within, with RADIUS transport. 
		The two profiles describe the application of this binding for ABFAB 
		authentication and assertion query/request respectively. The name identifier
		format allows a subject to be named using an NAI, and the subject confirmation
		methods allow queries to be issued for a principal without needing to explicitly 
		name the intended subject within the request. These artefacts have been defined 
		to permit application in scenarios other than ABFAB, such as network access.

        <section title="Introduction">
	    <t>
		The SAML RADIUS attribute, binding, profiles, name identifier format and confirmation methods
 		are motivated by the requirements 
		of the ABFAB architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-abfab-arch" />. In this 
		architecture, it is often desirable to convey Security Assertion Mark-up Language 
		(SAML) protocol messages between a SAML requester and SAML responder. This can be
		used, for example, to allow a Relying Party to request a SAML assertion from an 
		Identity Provider that describes a particular principal.
	    </t>
	    <t>
		SAML typically only considers the of use HTTP-based transports, known as bindings 
		<xref target="OASIS.saml-bindings-2.0-os" />, which are primarily intended for use
		with the SAML V2.0 Web Browser 
		Single Sign-On Profile <xref target="OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os" />.
		However the goal of ABFAB is to extend the applicability of federated identity 
		beyond the Web to other applications by building on the AAA framework. 
		Consequently there exists a requirement for SAML to integrate with the AAA
		framework and protocols such as RADIUS
		<xref target="RFC2865"/> and Diameter <xref target="RFC3588"/>, in addition
		to HTTP.
	    </t>
	    <t>
		A companion specification <xref target="I-D.jones-diameter-abfab" /> specifies 
		equivalent funtionality for Diameter.
            </t>
	    <t>
		In summary this document specifies:
	    </t>
	    <t>
		<list style="symbols">
		    <t>
			A SAML RADIUS attribute that defines how to encapsulate a SAML protocol 
			message within a RADIUS attribute.

			exchange SAML protocol messages.
	    	    </t>
			A SAML name identifier format in the form of a Network Access Identifier.
	    	    <t>
			An Authentication Profile that defines how the SAML RADIUS binding 
			is used to effect SAML-based authentication and authorization.

			An Assertion Query/Request Profile that defines how the SAML RADIUS 
			binding is used to effect SAML-based assertion request.
	    	    </t>
		    <t>
			Two subject confirmation methods for indicating that a user or machine 
			principal respectively is the subject of an assertion.

			Postal or electronic contact information for the author

			A reference to previously defined bindings or profiles that the new 
			binding updates or obsoletes

			In the case of a profile, any SAML confirmation method identifiers

			    to send a response in the context of this exchange. The SAML

		conduit for the EAP frames emitted by the User Agent and an EAP server which 
		acts as the Principal's Identity Provider. If the Identity Provider successfully 
		authenticates the Principal, it produces an authentication assertion which is 
		consumed by the Relying Party. During this process, a name identifier might 
		also be established between the Relying Party and the Identity Provider.
