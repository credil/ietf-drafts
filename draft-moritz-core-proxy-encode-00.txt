Abstract

   The scope of this document is to propose a new option to be used in
   conjunction with the CoAP proxy mechanisms.  Several content types
   can be converted stateless into each other.  The conversion may
   result in much more efficient representation of the resource.  But
   currently no mechanism exists to indicate the proxy to perform the
   compression.

Internet-Draft         CoAP Proxy Encode-To Option          January 2012


1.  Introduction

   The scope of this document is to propose a new option to be used in
   conjunction with the CoAP proxy mechanisms in coap-08
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap].  Several content types can be converted
   stateless into each other.

   Reasonable examples are XML to JSON or XML to EXI (and vice versa).
   All these representation formats can carry exactly the same
   structured data and information, while the conversion is stateless
   and requires no external information.

   To realize scenarios/applications and reuse existing implementations
   as much as possible it might be required to use e.g.  XML carried
   over HTTP in the backbone (i.e. unconstrained world) and e.g.  EXI
   carried over CoAP in the LoWPAN (i.e. constrained world).

   To map/convert CoAP to HTTP and vice versa dedicated proxies are
   defined in CoAP.  But currently exists no mechanism to indicate the
   proxy to map/convert also the payload.

   While starting with the 6LoWPAN/IPv6 optimizations and mappings at
   the addressing layer and ending up with the CoAP/HTTP optimizations
   and mappings at the application, optimize and map also the payload
   encoding to more efficient formats is the last step.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Problem Statement

   The only currently existing way to realize a mapping of the payload
   representation is to implement it statically in the proxy.  Thereby,
   each message to a CoAP endpoint is converted from e.g.  XML into EXI
   and to EXI to XML for messages to HTTP endpoints.  But if the proxy
   should be used for different applications it is required to keep a
   state in the proxy, i.e. which conversion/mapping has to be performed
   for which pair of endpoints.

   In a deployment the knowledge about supported content types for a
   certain endpoint or resource might already be known by the requesting
   client.  This knowledge was retrieved by the client e.g. through
   central registries (e.g.  CoAP Resource Directory) during the

   discovery phase.  For a request, the client then can use a proxy, but
   needs to indicate the proxy to convert the payload to the certain
   content type and vice versa for the response.  Therefore a new CoAP
   option has to be defined.


4.  Encode-to Option

   The typical scenario will be a HTTP client requesting a CoAP
   endpoint.  If the HTTP client wants to indicate a required conversion
   of the payload it includes a Pragma HTTP header field in the request.
   The value of the Pragma header field is "encode-to=" followed by the
   content type the payload has to be converted to.  Valid content types
   are derived from the existing media types for HTTP.  If further
   parameters are required for the conversion, these parameters are
   added as parameters to the Pragma header field.

   The HTTP-CoAP Proxy MUST process the Pragma header if present in the
   request and it includes the "encode-to" option.  If the required
   conversion cannot be performed by the proxy it MUST response with a
   415 Unsupported Media Type status code.

   If the Proxy can perform the required conversion it replaces the
   existing message body for the CoAP request with the differently
   encoded one.  To avoid keeping any state on the proxy, the origin
   content type is included in the CoAP request.  Therefore the
   "encode-to" CoAP option (to be defined, format: string, length: 1-270
   Byte, default:none) is used.  The value of the CoAP "encode-to"
   option is the origin content type and if required including
   parameters for the conversion back.  The value should re-use media
   type IDs as already defined for CoAP.

   The CoAP endpoint is not required to process the "encode-to" option,
   but MUST echo the option and the value in the response if it decides
   not to process the option.  Nevertheless, the CoAP endpoint MAY
   decide to process the option and encode the response in the format
   expressed in the "encode-to" option.  In this case the "encode-to"
   option MUST NOT be echoed in the CoAP response.

   The proxy receiving the CoAP respone message with the "encode-to"
   option MUST process this option and perform the required conversion
   before forwarding the message to the HTTP endpoint.  In the HTTP
   response no further header field is required to be echoed back.  If
   the proxy is not able to process the required conversion correctly it
   MAY forward the message body as it is to the HTTP endpoint (or SHOULD
   response with a 415 Unsupported Media Type status code?).

5.  Alternative

   In the coap-misc draft a user-defined option definition is described.
   An alternative approach would be to define an application specific
   Pragma option also for CoAP.  This option could occur more than ones
   in a request/response and fulfill all the required user-defined
   mechanisms.  This may include the "encode-to" feature described in
   this draft.
