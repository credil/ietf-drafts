           Home Agent Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6
               draft-yokota-mext-ha-init-flow-binding-02

Abstract

   There are scenarios in which the home agent needs to trigger flow
   binding operations towards the mobile node such as moving a flow from
   one access network to another based on the network resource
   availability.  In order for the home agent to be able to initiate
   interactions for flow bindings with the mobile node, this document
   defines new signaling messages and sub-options for Mobile IPv6.  Home
   agent initiated flow bindings are supported for both IPv4 and IPv6
   enabled mobile nodes.

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6      July 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RFC6089] allows a mobile node to bind a particular flow to a care-of
   address without affecting other flows using the same home address.
   Binding Update (BU)/Binding Acknowledgement(BA) messages are extended
   for the mobile node to add, modify, remove and refresh flow binding
   in a home agent.  The operations are always initiated by the mobile
   node.

   In some cases, the home agent would like to initiate flow binding
   operations. e.g, the home agent revokes a flow binding for reasons
   such as accounting insufficiency of the mobile node; for the mobile
   node equipped with multiple interfaces, the home agent moves a flow
   binding from one interface to another based on network resource
   availability; the home agent provisions default flow binding rules to
   the mobile node based on the mobile node's default profile.

   This document defines one new Mobility Header and two new messages
   for the home agent to control flow bindings in the mobile node.  Flow
   mobility for the mobile nodes with IPv4 home address and IPv4 address
   of the home agent as described in [RFC5555] is also supported.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC3775] and [RFC6089].


3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Over-the-air Flow Binding Provisioning

   When a new subscriber purchases a dual mode phone equipped with both
   3GPP and WiFi interfaces, depending on the services that the
   subscriber can use, the operator provisions the mobile phone over the
   air with the following information:

   o  3GPP access takes priority over WiFi access when providing Voice-
      over-IP (VoIP) service.  That is, when making a call, the 3GPP
      network is always used as far as the network is accessible.
   o  WiFi access is primarily selected to serve IPTV service.

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6      July 2012


   o  Peer-to-peer (p2p) download is only allowed through WiFi access.

   The above profile can be downloaded through the home agent to the
   mobile node when registering.

3.2.  Traffic Offload

   The 3G operator may want to move traffic flows from the 3G access to
   another due to ever-increasing traffic load in the 3G access network.
   Fine-grained traffic offload is desirable.  For example, IMS-based
   VoIP flows must stay in the mobile core network while video streaming
   flows provided by servers on the Internet could bypass the mobile
   core network via WiFi access.  Since the network knows more about its
   conditions and has access to the policy server, more timely and well-
   controlled traffic offloading is possible.  To this end, already
   established sessions are moved by the home agent by sending down an
   updated flow descriptor to the mobile node.

3.3.  Flow Binding Revocation

   For administrative reasons, such as the utilization of CPU of a home
   agent reaches a threshold or the home agent needs to reboot some of
   it line cards, sometimes it becomes necessary to inform the mobile
   node that its flow binding has been revoked and the mobile node is no
   longer able to receive IP mobility service for a given flow.  Apart
   from revocation, the home agent may decide to delete a flow binding
   with a delete operation.

3.4.  Exceeding traffic quota

   The 3G operator offers a mobile broadband service with a flat rate
   subscription limited to 5G Byte per month.  Once the quota is reached
   the service is downgraded to 64 K bit per second.  This limitation
   does not prevent the user from using the 3G access for mobile
   broadband services and there is no reason for the operator to change
   the policy since the service is still available.  However, since the
   operator has more information available than the user, the operator
   can indicate this to the user by sending modified flow descriptors to
   the user as a proposal to change access for an ongoing session.


4.  Protocol Operation

   [RFC6089] makes use of Binding Update (BU) /Binding
   Acknowledgement(BA) signalling to forward, i.e. register or discard a
   flow binding in a home agent.  That is, flow binding operations are
   always initiated from the mobile node.  The mechanism specified in
   this document is complimentary to the method described in [RFC6089].

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6      July 2012


   It is assumed that the home agent has already created Binding Cache
   entries for the mobile node before launching flow binding operations.

   In this document, one new Mobility Header and two new messages are
   defined, that is, Flow Binding Indication (FBI) Section 6.1.1 and
   Flow Binding Acknowledgement (FBA)Section 6.1.2.  FBI is used by the
   home agent to initiate flow binding operations, while FBA is used for
   acknowledging FBI.

   Due to access network change on the mobile node side, some interface
   that used to be active may not be valid at the time of flow binding
   operation by the home agent, in which case, even if the HA sends the
   FBI to the MN, the FBA will not return.  After retransmitting the
   FBIs for MAX_FBI_RETRIES times and not receiving the FBA, the HA
   determines that the target interface is not available.

4.1.  Adding flow bindings

   Adding the flow binding implies associating a flow with a particular
   care-of address for the mobile node.  The care-of address concerned
   with the flow binding is present in the destination address of the
   packet or the alternate care-of address option.  Alternatively, the
   care-of address may be indicated by the Target Care-of Address sub-
   option defined in Section 6.2.2.  Binding Identification number (BID)
   described in [RFC5648] is not used in the flows initiated by the home
   agent.

   When adding a new flow binding, the home agent sends a FBI with a
   Flow Identification Mobility option to the mobile node.  The Flow
   Identification Mobility option defined in [RFC6089] includes a unique
   Flow Identifier (FID).  The Flow binding action sub-option MUST
   indicate Add operation defined in Section 6.2.1.  The FID needs only
   be unique for the receiver of the message that adds a flow, i.e. the
   same FID can be used across different receivers of the message.

4.2.  Deleting flow bindings

   When removing a flow binding, the home agent sends a FBI with a Flow
   Identification Mobility option in which the Flow binding action sub-
   option indicates Delete operation.  The Flow Identification Mobility
   option includes a unique FID for the mobile node to locate the flow
   binding and remove it.

4.3.  Modifying flow bindings

   When modifying a flow binding (either the care-of address or other
   attributes of the flow), the home agent sends the mobile node a FBI
   message with Flow Identification Mobility option.  The option



Yokota, et al.          Expires January 15, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6      July 2012


   includes the FID for the binding being modified.  A Traffic Selector
   sub-option may come with the Flow Identification Mobility Option and
   contain the new attributes needed to classify the flow such as DS
   (Differential Services) values in [RFC6088].  Hence, flow
   modification is essentially a process where an existing flow
   definition is removed and a new flow (included in the option) is
   added with the same FID as the flow that was removed.

4.4.  Refreshing flow bindings

   A flow binding is refreshed by simply including the Flow
   Identification Mobility option with Refresh Action field in the FBI
   message.  The message should be sent before the expiration of the
   flow binding.  The message updates existing bindings with new
   information.  Hence, all information previously sent in the last
   refreshing message need to be resent, otherwise such information will
   be lost.

4.5.  Moving flow bindings

   The home agent can move a flow associated to one interface of the
   multi-interfaced mobile node to another by sending a FBI message to
   the mobile node.  A Flow Identification Mobility option whose Action
   field is set to Move is included.  The address of the target
   interface is also included in the Flow Identification Mobility option
   in Target Care-of Address sub-option.

4.6.  Revoking flow bindings

   When the home agent or the network attached to it is overloaded, the
   home agent can revoke a flow binding registered by the mobile node.
   The home agent sends the mobile node a FBI message with a Flow
   Identification Mobility option in which the Flow binding action sub-
   option indicates Revoke operation.  When the MN receives the FBI
   message with Revoke operation, it returns the FBA and decides whether
   the flow should be removed (de-registration) or moved to another
   interface.  The mobile node SHOULD take an action by sending a new BU
   to, for example, deregister the flow.


5.  Handling of the Flow Bindings List

   Flow bindings list defined in [RFC6089] needs to be modified after
   each protocol operation defined above as follows:

   If FBI contains a flow binding add operation and if the corresponding
   FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST add a new entry
   to the flow bindings list.  FID, Flow Descriptor, FID-PRI and Action

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6      July 2012


   fields are taken from the Flow Identification Mobility Option.  BID
   is copied from the Binding Reference sub-option.  Active/Inactive
   Flag is set to Active.  Note that if BID is not available it may be
   replaced by Care-of-Address.

   If FBI contains a flow binding delete operation and if the
   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST
   locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then delete the
   entry.

   If the home agent sends a Binding Revocation Indication message with
   Flow Mobility Option where the action field is set to Revoke and if
   the corresponding Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message
   indicates acceptance, home agent MUST locate the list entry
   corresponding to this flow and then delete the entry.

   If FBI contains a flow binding modify operation and if the
   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST
   delete the list entry corresponding to this flow and then add a new
   entry setting the values as defined in the Flow Identification
   Mobility Option.

   If FBI contains a flow binding refresh operation and if the
   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST
   locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then set Active/
   Inactive Flag to Active.

   If FBI contains a flow binding move operation and if the
   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST
   locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then change the
   BID value to the Care-of-Address in the Flow Identification Mobility
   Option.

   If FBI contains a flow binding switch operation and if the
   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST
   locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then delete the
   entry.

   Flow binding operations apply equally to IPv6 packets as well as IPv4
   packets as in Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 [RFC5555].


6.  Flow Binding Messages and Options

6.1.  Mobility Header

   The messages described below follow the Mobility Header format
   specified in Section 6.1 of [RFC3775].

6.1.1.  Flow Binding Indication

   The Flow Binding Indication messages are used by the home agent to
   initiate flow binding operations to the mobile node.  The Flow
   Binding Indication messages use the MH Type value (IANA-TBD1) for
   Flow Binding message and a Flow Binding Type value of 1, and the
   format of the Message Data field in the Mobility Header is as
   follows:
      0                   1                   2                   3

      These fields are unused.  They MUST be initialized to zero by the
      sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Mobility Options
      Variable-length field of such length that the complete Mobility
      Header is an integer multiple of 8 octets long.  Flow
      Identification Mobility Options are included in this field.


6.1.2.  Flow Binding Acknowledgement

   The Flow Binding Acknowledgement is used to acknowledge receipt of a
   Flow Binding Indication.  The mobile node sends FBA message to
   acknowledge the reception of FBI to Add, Delete, Modify, Refresh,
   Move, or Switch a flow binding.  On receiving messages with Flow
   Identification Mobility Option(s), the mobile node should copy each
   Flow Identification Mobility Option to the Acknowledgement messages.
   The Flow Binding Acknowledgement has the MH Type value (IANA-TBD1)
   for Flow Binding message and a Flow Binding Type value of 2.  When
   this value is indicated in the MH Type field, the format of the
   Message Data field in the Mobility Header is as follows:
      0                   1                   2                   3

   Action
      This is a 8-bit field that describes the required processing for
      the option.  It can be assigned one of the following new values:

      11  Add a flow binding
      12  Delete a flow binding
      13  Modify a flow binding
      14  Refresh a flow binding
      15  Move a flow binding
      16  Revoke a flow binding
      All the other values are reserved for future use

6.2.2.  Target Care-of-Address sub-option

   This section introduces the Target Care-of-Address sub-option, which
   may be included in the Flow Identification Mobility Option.  This
   sub-option is used to indicate the mobile node to move a flow binding
   from one interface to another.

      This field is unused.  It MUST be initialized to zero by the
      sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Target Care-of-Address
      The address of an interface that the flow is moved to.  This
      address could be IPv4 or IPv6 address.  This sub-option MUST be
      included when the action taken is "15 Move a flow binding".

7.  Security Considerations

   Security issues for this document follow those of [RFC6088],[RFC6089]
   and [RFC5846].  This specification allows the home agent to
   manipulate only the binding of a flow(s) that is currently registered
   with it, which is the same principle described in [RFC5846].  No
   additional security issue specific to this document is identified.


8.  Protocol constants

   Maximum FBI retries (MAX_FBI_RETRIES)
      This variable specifies the maximum number of times the HA MAY
      retransmit a Flow Binding Indication message when FBA is not
      returned within the time period specified by MAX_FBA_TIMEOUT.  The
      default value for this parameter is 3.

   Maximum FBA timeout (MAX_FBA_TIMEOUT)
      This variable specifies the maximum time in seconds the HA MUST
      wait before retransmitting another FBI message.  The default for
      this parameter is 3 seconds.


9.  IANA considerations

   This document defines one new Mobility Header and two new mobility
   options to be used in Flow Binding Initiate and Flow Binding
   Acknowledge messages.  A new Mobility Header Type and two new sub-opt
   type values (IANA-TBD1, IANA-TBD2 and IANA-TBD3) need to be assigned
   by IANA.
