Abstract

   When IP VPNs are used to interconnect end-systems
   [I-D.marques-l3vpn-end-system] it may be desirable to introduce
   traffic control rules at a finer level of granularity than an IP
   destination address.

   This document extends the end-system IP VPN specification with
   support for fine grain traffic classification, filtering and
   redirection rules.  It applies the existing BGP IP VPN flow
   specification dissemination mechanism [RFC5575] to end-system IP VPNs
   in order to provide the ability to control IP packets that match a
   specific pattern, which may include fields other than the IP
   destination address.

Internet-Draft  Traffic classification on end-system VPNs   October 2011


1.  Introduction

   When end-system IP VPNs [I-D.marques-l3vpn-end-system] are used to
   interconnect Virtual Machines or other multi-tenant applications it
   may be desirable to control the flow of traffic between sender(s) and
   receiver at a finer level of granularity than an IP destination host
   prefix.

   In the IP protocol model, ingress points map traffic into forwarding
   equivalence classes (FECs) which are then given consistent treatment
   through a transport network.  This document defines a signaling
   protocol that conveys traffic classification rules.  These rules can
   be applied by ingress points into an end-system IP VPN in order to
   define FECs that depend on both the destination IP address of the
   traffic as well as additional fiels such as the the transport
   protocol and ports.

   One example where this may be desirable is in scenarios where
   different VPNs may exchange traffic directly.  For instance, a VPN
   that provides a common service to multiple tenants.  In this case,
   the owner of the destination address may wish to inject a traffic
   rule that limits traffic to TCP packets to and from a specific port.
   Another example is an application that request specific diffserv
   [RFC2474] markings for certain types of traffic.  In other
   situations, network administrators may wish to inject specific rules
   that temporarily redirect traffic.

   This document uses a point-to-multipoint model for traffic filtering
   rules where the traffic egress requests all the ingresses to perform
   a given traffic classification action.  The entity that advertises
   the destination address of the traffic, or a proxy in its behalf,
   injects a flow-based route advertisement into the signaling
   infrastructure.  This flow-based route is propagated according to VPN
   policies to all the ingress points of the VPN, the end-systems which
   contain VMs allowed to access the destination.

   The traffic filtering rules are then applied at all the ingress
   points of the VPN.  The egress MAY also choose to apply the same
   rules in cases where they are equivalent at both locations.

                                 Figure 1

   The figure above contains an example topology in which a given VM (VM
   3) provides a common infrastructure service.  VM1 and VM2 belong to
   different tenants and are in VPNs which are allowed to access the
   service in VM3.

   This specification allows VM3 to advertise a traffic filtering rule,
   as a flow-spec route, requesting the Host OSes in host 1 and host 2
   to limit any traffic flow to VM3's destination IP address such that,
   for instance, only packets for a specific TCP destination port are
   allowed.

   It is important to note that traffic filtering does not avoid the
   need for application level authorization and authentication.

   When a flow-spec route is advertised, the number of possible ingress
   points it not known in advance.  There is no mechanism to generate a
   positive or negative acknowledgement from the ingress points.  This
   is in contrast to the more traditional network management operation
   in which the management station is aware of all the agents that must
   be controlled.

   As with the base end-system IP VPN specification, the forwarding and
   signaling networks are distinct.  Flow-spec routes are advertised by
   the egress end-system or by a proxy in its behalf.  The routes are
   injected into one or more XMPP signaling gateways and propagated
   using the BGP flow-spec address family [RFC5575].

   Using the same vrf-import and export policies that define the IP VPN,
   the flow-spec routes are then imported from BGP into a vpn-specific
   database and advertised to all the ingress end-system, which apply
   them.

   This document limits itself to "stateless" traffic classification
   rules that classify a given IP packet independently of any previous

2.  End-system functionality

   It is common for end-systems to support traffic classification .  One
   such example is the Linux "ipchains" functionality.  This document
   assumes that such functionality can be associated with a particular
   Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) table on the end-system and that
   each virtual interface is associated with a VRF.  The traffic
   classification rules described in this document are applied at the
   VRF level.

   The BGP Flow Specification [RFC5575] document lists a set of IPv4
   protocol header fields and match operations that are though to be a
   minimum common set of supported functionality among hardware
   implementations.

   These fields are:

   o  IPv4 destination address.

   o  IPv4 source address.

   o  IP protocol identifier.

   o  Transport Ports: Source, Destination or Either.

   o  ICMP Type and Code.

   o  TCP flags.

   o  Packet length.

   o  Diffserv Code Point.

   o  IPv4 fragmentation flags.

   When numeric values are specified (i.e. fields other than IP
   addresses), the match operator can specify a list of values with
   inequality operators.  Note that this may result in one logical rule,
   as defined by this specification to be implemented as multiple
   classification rules on the underlying OS implementation.  For
   instance the match operations in the Linux "ipchains" implementation
   are more restrictive.

   The match operator is defined via the following BNF grammar:

Internet-Draft  Traffic classification on end-system VPNs   October 2011


   <match> ::=  <terms>

   <terms> ::=  <term>

      | <term> "||" <terms>

      | <term> "&&" <terms>

   <term> ::=  <operator> value

   <operator> ::=  "<" | "<=" | "=" | "!=" | ">=" | ">"

   As an example, a value range is expressed as: ">= begin && <= end".

   The result of a flow-spec rule is one of the following actions:

   o  allow

   o  deny

   o  rate-limit

   o  redirect

   o  copy

   o  log

   o  set-dscp

   The redirect and copy actions have as a target an FEC which should
   contain an unique UUID [RFC4122] identifier as well as information
   regarding the SNPA address and label used for forwarding.

   The copy action instructs the system to generate a copy of the
   original packet and forward to the specified FEC.  Both copy and log
   actions have an additional parameter which controls whether all
   matching packets or a sample is subject to the specified treatment.

   The 'set-dscp' action specifies the DSCP value to be assigned to the
   outer IP header of the packet, when a packet is encapsulated.

3.  XML schema

   In the end-system IP VPN [I-D.marques-l3vpn-end-system]
   specification, IP reachability information is encoded as XMPP "item"
   information belonging to collection nodes where each collection is
   the IP reachability information for a given VPN.  End-systems can
   publish and receive notifications for these nodes.

   This document uses the same approach.  It uses a collection with the
   name of "<vpn-customer-name>/ip4-flow-spec" to publish and receive
   updates corresponding to IPv4 flow-spec routes.  When an end-system
   published a node into such a collection it must generate a node name
   that is unique among the nodes that it publishes.  It then associates
   that node with the collection.

   XML encoding used by flow-spec items:

   <item>
     <entry xmlns='http://ietf.org/protocol/bgpvpn/ip4-flow-spec'>
       <ip4-destination>10.0.1/24</ip4-destination>
       <ip4-source>20.0.128/20</ip4-source>
       <ip4-protocol>=6 || =17</ip4-protocol>
       <port>=80</port>
       <destination-port>=80</destination-port>
       <source-port>=80</source-port>
       <icmp-type>=1</icmp-type>
       <icmp-code>=1</icmp-code>
       <tcp-flags>=(syn|rst|ack|fin)</tcp-flags>
       <ip-length>>40</ip-length>
       <dscp>=0</dscp>
       <ip4-fragment>=(df|first|more|last)</ip4-fragment>
       <action>
         <accept/>
         <deny/>
         <rate-limit rate='10pps'/>
         <redirect>
           <fec uuid='550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'>
             <snpa af='1'>'infrastructure-ip-address'</snpa>
             <label>1</label>
           </fec>
         </redirect>
         <copy>
           <fec>...</fec>
           <sample/>
         </copy>
         <log/>
         <set-dscp>128</set-dscp>
       </action>
     </entry>
   </item>

   The sequence of XML elements in an item SHOULD follow the "flow
   specification" NLRI type order as the example above.  IP source and
   destination prefixes are encoded in their standard textual
   representation of <dotted notation>"/"<prefix-length>.  Protocol and
   Port elements are expressed using the match operator syntax
   documented above. "<port>" and "<destination-port>" or "<source-
   port>" SHOULD be mutually exclusive.  The icmp type and code fields
   as well as ip-length and dscp are again encoded using the value match
   operator.  The ">tcp-flags>" element uses either an equality or match
   operation of the TCP header flags.  A binary match is expressed as
   "m/(syn|rst|ack|fin)/".  The "<ip4-fragment>" element may also use a
   binary match operation.

4.  Signaling gateway functionality

   As with IP reachabilty information, signaling gateways create a
   routing database for each 'vpn-customer-name'.  An XMPP client (an
   end-system) can publish and subscribe to multiple of these databases.
   Each "virtual interface" on the end-system is associated with a
   virtual routing table on the gateway.

   From a signaling perspective, the gateway functions as a IP VPN PE as
   described in section 8 of [RFC5575].  As with IP reachability, this
   document uses the XMPP interface to delegate the forwarding
   functionality to the end-system, separating it from the signaling
   node.

   In [RFC5575] no route validation procedure is defined for the IP VPN
   application.  For the purposes of the end-system IP VPN application,
   signaling gateways SHOULD enforce the following rules.

      A flow-spec route is valid if its Route Target list is an exact
      match to the export route target list for the virtual routing
      table.

      A flow-spec route is valid if it contains an IP destination
      prefixes and there is an exact match between its Route Target list
      and the Route Target list contained in the IP unicast route that
      covers that specific destination prefix.

      A flow-spec route should be considered unfeasible otherwise and
      not imported into the specific virtual routing database.

5.  Top-of-rack switch

   It may be desirable to implement some of the traffic classification
   functionality on a traditional network element, rather than in the
   end-system.  For instance the end-system may not fully support all
   the desired functionality.

   In this case, a network element can have access to the signaling
   information using two different methods:

      By receiving BGP signaling information directly.  A Top-of-rack
      switch, for example, could infer whether a given end-system is
      downstream from it by examining the IP infrastructure addresses of
      the end-systems and extracting information into its forwarding
      plane whenever an end-point of a VPN is downstream.

      By using a "men-in-the-middle" technique in which the XMPP client
      sessions from end-systems terminate in the TOP-of-rack switches.
      The switch can then establish an XMPP session to the signaling
      gateway and proxy the information between the two sessions.

   The second approach presents the switch itself with a simplified
   interface in which it does not need to understand the policies
   associated with a specific VPN.

6.  Applications

   This specification provides a mechanism to distribute traffic
   classification rules to many enforcement points.  This may of
   interest in applications where it is desirable to avoid the standard
   approach of a centralized enforcement point.  Typically in situations
   where the volume of traffic or the nature of the problem make it more
   cost effective to do so.

   One such application is the enforcement of stateless traffic
   forwarding rules for infrastructure services.  An application level
   services, such as a storage server may need to support multiple data-
   center tenants.  In this scenario the storage VPN advertises a given
   address prefix, which contains both the anycast IP address of the
   load-balancers as the addresses of individual servers.  Using VPN
   import policies, the data-center management solution allows the
   tenant specific VPNs to see these routes.  The tenant VPN addresses
   must also be reachable on the storage VPN, in this example.

   This specification allows the storage service to block out traffic
   that does not match the specific transport protocols used to provide
   this service.  It also allows confirming traffic to be marked with
   the appropriate diffserv classification.  The network administrator
   case also use this mechanism for diagnostic purposes.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are two independent areas that are worth examining when it
   comes to security.  The integrity of the control plane information
   and the forwarding actions.

   This document assumes that all signaling interactions use mutual
   authentication, where all communication channels are authenticated.

   For traffic filtering and redirection this mechanism assumes a "best-
   effort" model.  The ingress points will strive to perform the actions
   specified by the egress.  However there are no strict guarantees that
   the actions can be applied successfully on an ingress points or that
   the order of operations is such that no non-conforming traffic is
   ever presented to the egress.

   For traffic filtering rules, the egress point can choose to apply the
   rules also in order to provide stronger guarantees.

   Applications should themselves authenticate its communication peers
   my methods that do not depend on the IP addresses used at the network
   layer.
