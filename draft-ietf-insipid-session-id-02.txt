                     draft-ietf-insipid-session-id-02


Abstract

   This document describes an end-to-end Session Identifier for use in
   IP-based Multimedia Communication systems that enables endpoints,
   intermediate devices, and management systems to identify a session
   end-to-end, associate multiple endpoints with a given multipoint
   conference, track communication sessions when they are redirected,
   and associate one or more media flows with a given communication
   session.

1. Introduction

   IP-based multimedia communication systems like SIP [RFC3261] and
   H.323 [H.323] have the concept of a "call identifier" that is



Jones, et al.          Expires January 15, 2014                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft          End-To-End Session ID                  July 2013


   globally unique.  The identifier is intended to represent an end-to-
   end communication session from the originating device to the
   terminating device.  Such an identifier is useful for
   troubleshooting, session tracking, and so forth.

   Unfortunately, there are a number of factors that contribute to the
   fact that the current call identifiers defined in SIP and H.323 are
   not suitable for end-to-end session identification.  A fundamental
   issue in protocol interworking is the fact that the syntax for the
   call identifier in SIP and H.323 is different between the two
   protocols.  This important fact makes it impossible for call
   identifiers to be exchanged end-to-end when a network utilizes one or
   more session protocols.

   Another reason why the current call identifiers are not suitable to
   identify the session end-to-end is that in real-world deployments
   devices like session border controllers often change the session
   signaling as it passes through the device, including the value of the
   call identifier.  While this is deliberate and useful, it makes it
   very difficult to track sessions end-to-end.

   This draft presents a new identifier, referred to as the Session
   Identifier, or "Session ID", and associated syntax intended to
   overcome the issues that exist with the currently defined call
   identifiers.  The proposal in this document attempts to comply with
   the requirements specified in [I-D.ietf-insipid-session-id-reqts].
   This proposal also has capabilities not mentioned in [RFC5234], shown
   in call flows in section 10. Additionally, this proposal attempts to
   account for a previous, proprietary version of a SIP Session ID
   header, proposing a backwards compatibility of sorts, described in
   section 11.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]
   when they appear in ALL CAPS.  These words may also appear in this
   document in lower case as plain English words, absent their normative
   meanings.

   The terms "Session Identifier" and "Session ID" refer to the value of
   the identifier, whereas "Session-ID" refers to the header used to
   convey the identifier.

3. Session Identifier Requirements and Use Cases

   Requirements and Use Cases for the end-to-end Session Identifier can
   be found in a separate memo titled "Requirements for an End-to-End
   Session Identification in IP-Based Multimedia Communication Networks"
   [I-D.ietf-insipid-session-id-reqts].

Internet-Draft          End-To-End Session ID                  July 2013


4. Constructing and Conveying the Session Identifier

4.1. Constructing the Session Identifier

   The Session Identifier is comprised of two RFC 4122 defined UUIDs
   [RFC4122], with each UUID representing one of the endpoints
   participating in the session.

   The version number in the UUID indicates the manner in which the UUID
   is generated, such as using random values or using the MAC address of
   the endpoint.  To satisfy the requirement that no user or device
   information be conveyed, endpoints SHOULD generate version 4 (random)
   or version 5 (SHA-1) UUIDs.

   When generating a version 5 UUID, endpoints or intermediaries MUST
   utilize the following "name space ID" (see Section 4.3 of RFC4122):

       uuid_t NameSpace_SessionID = {
           /* a58587da-c93d-11e2-ae90-f4ea67801e29 */
           0xa58587da,
           0xc93d,
           0x11e2,
           0xae, 0x90, 0xf4, 0xea, 0x67, 0x80, 0x1e, 0x29
       }

   Further, the "name" to utilize for version 5 UUIDs is the
   concatenation of the Call-ID header value and the "tag" parameter
   that appears on the "From" or "To" line associated with the device
   for which the UUID is created.  Once an endpoint generates a UUID for
   a session, the UUID never changes, even if values originally used as
   input into its construction change over time.

   Intermediaries that insert a Session-ID header into a SIP message on
   behalf of a sending User Agent MUST utilize version 5 UUIDs to ensure
   that UUIDs for the communication session are always generated with
   the same values.  If an intermediary does not know the tag value for
   an endpoint, the intermediary MUST NOT attempt to generate a UUID for
   that endpoint.  Note that if an intermediary is stateless and the
   endpoint on one end of the call is replaced with another endpoint due
   to some service interaction, the values used to create the UUID might
   change and, if so, the intermediary will compute a different UUID.

4.2. Conveying the Session Identifier

   The SIP user agent (UA) initially transmitting the SIP request will
   create a UUID and transmit that to the ultimate destination UA.
   Likewise, the responding UA will create a UUID and transmit that to
   the first UA.  These two distinct UUIDs form what is referred to as
   the Session Identifier and is represented in this document in set
   notation of the form {A,B}, where A is UUID value from the UA
   transmitting a message and B is the UUID value from the intended



Jones, et al.          Expires January 15, 2014                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          End-To-End Session ID                  July 2013


   recipient of the message, i.e., not an intermediary server along the
   signaling path.  The set {A,B} is equal to the set {B,A}, and thus
   both represent the same Session Identifier.

   In the case where only one UUID is known, such as when a UA first
   initiates a SIP request, the Session ID would be {A}, where "A"
   represents the single UUID value transmitted.

   Since SIP sessions are subject to any number of service interactions,
   SIP INVITE messages might be forked as sessions are established, and
   since conferences might be established or expanded with endpoints
   calling in or the conference focus calling out, the construction of
   the Session Identifier from a set of UUIDs is important.

   To understand this better, consider that a UA participating in a
   communication session might be replaced with another, such as the
   case where two "legs" of a call are joined together by a PBX.
   Suppose that UA A and UA B both call UA C.  Further suppose that UA C
   uses a local PBX function to join the call between itself and UA A
   with the call between itself and UA B.  This merged call needs to be
   identified and identification of such sessions is natural and easily
   traceable when utilizing UUID values assigned by each entity in the
   communication session.

   In the case of forking, UA A might send an INVITE that gets forked to
   five different UAs, as an example.  A means of identifying each of
   these separate communication sessions is needed and allowing the set
   of {A, B1}, {A, B2}, {A, B3}, {A, B4}, and {A, B5} makes this
   possible.

   For conferencing scenarios, it is also useful to have a two-part
   Session Identifier where the conference focus specifies one UUID.
   This might allow for correlation among the participants in a single
   conference, for example.

   How a device acting on Session Identifiers stores, processes, or
   utilizes the Session Identifier is outside the scope of this
   document.

5. Transmitting the Session Identifier in SIP

   Each session initiated or accepted MUST have a local UA-generated
   UUID associated with the session.  This value MUST remain unchanged
   throughout the duration of that session.

   A SIP UA MUST convey its Session Identifier UUID in all transmitted
   messages within the same session.  To do this, each transmitted
   message MUST include the Session-ID header.  The Session-ID header
   has the following ABNF [RFC5234] syntax:

     session-id    = "Session-ID" HCOLON local-uuid



Jones, et al.          Expires January 15, 2014                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          End-To-End Session ID                  July 2013


                     *(SEMI sess-id-param)

     local-uuid    = sess-uuid

     remote-uuid   = sess-uuid

     sess-uuid     = 32(DIGIT / %x61-66)  ;32 chars of [0-9a-f]

     sess-id-param = remote-param / generic-param

     remote-param  = "remote" EQUAL remote-uuid

   The productions "SEMI", "EQUAL", and "generic-param" are defined in
   RFC 3261.  The production DIGIT is defined in RFC 5234.

   The Session-ID header MUST NOT have more than one "remote" parameter.

   The "local-uuid" in the Session-ID header represents the UUID value
   of the UA transmitting the message.  If the UA transmitting the
   message previously received a UUID value from its peer endpoint, it
   MUST include that UUID as the "remote" parameter in each message it
   transmits.  For example, a Session-ID header might appear like this:

     Session-ID: ab30317f1a784dc48ff824d0d3715d86;
                 remote=47755a9de7794ba387653f2099600ef2

   The UUID values are presented as strings of lower-case hexadecimal
   characters, with the most significant byte of the UUID appearing
   first.

   A UUID having the value of all zeros is a special UUID value. It is
   used in certain special cases, and hereafter is defined as the "null"
   UUID value. Either the "local-uuid" field or "remote-uuid" field can
   have a "null" value.

6. Endpoint Behavior

   To comply with this specification, SIP UAs MUST include a Session-ID
   header-value in all SIP messages transmitted as a part of a
   communication session.  The UUID of the transmitter of the message
   MUST appear in the "local-uuid" portion of the Session-ID header-
   value with one exception, mentioned below, and the UUID of the peer
   device, if known, must appear as the "remote" parameter following the
   transmitter's UUID.

   Once a UA allocates a UUID value for a communication session, the UA
   MUST NOT change that UUID value for the duration of the session,
   including when

      - communication attempts are retried due to receipt of 4xx
        messages or request timeouts;



Jones, et al.          Expires January 15, 2014                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          End-To-End Session ID                  July 2013


      - the session is redirected in response to a 3xx message; or
      - a session is transferred via a REFER message [RFC3515], or when
        a SIP dialog is replaced via an INVITE with Replaces [RFC3891].

   The exception to including the UUID of the transmitting entity
   mentioned above is in the case of provisional responses that occur
   before the destination UA has generated its UUID.  The 100 (Trying)
   response and the 181 (Call Forwarding) response are examples of such
   provisional responses. In these cases, the sending intermediary
   places the one known UUID in the remote-uuid field, and leaves the
   "local-uuid" blank. This placement is always where a UA expects to
   receive its UUID value in SIP responses.

   A non-intermediary UA that receives a Session-ID header MUST take
   note of the first UUID value (i.e., the "local-uuid") that it
   receives in the Session-ID header and assume that that is the UUID of
   the peer endpoint within that communications session.  UAs MUST
   include this received UUID value as the "remote" parameter when
   transmitting subsequent messages, making sure not to change this UUID
   value in the process of moving the value internally from the "local-
   uuid" field to the "remote-uuid" field.

   It should be noted that messages received by a UA might contain a
   "local-uuid" parameter that does not match what the UA expected the
   far end UA's UUID to be.  This might happen as a result of service
   interactions by intermediaries and MUST NOT negatively affect the
   communication session.  However, the UA may log this event for the
   purposes of troubleshooting.

   For any purpose the UA has for the Session Identifier, it MUST assume
   that the Session Identifier is {A,B} where "A" is the UUID value of
   this endpoint (i.e., "local-uuid") and "B" is the UUID value of the
   peer endpoint (i.e., "remote-uuid"), taken from the most recently
   received message within this session.  Note that when comparing
   Session Identifiers for equivalence, the identifier {A,B} is equal to
   the set {B,A}.

   An endpoint MUST assume that the UUID value of the peer UA MAY change
   at any time due to service interactions.  If the UUID value of the
   peer UA changes, the UA MUST include this new UUID as the "remote"
   parameter in any subsequent messages.

   It is also important to note that if a session is forked by an
   intermediary in the network, the initiating UA may receive multiple
   responses back from different endpoints, each of which will contain a
   different UUID ("local-uuid") value in each response received by this
   initiating UA.  UAs MUST take care to ensure that the correct UUID
   value is returned in the "remote" parameter when responding to those
   endpoints.

Internet-Draft          End-To-End Session ID                  July 2013


   Cascading MCUs all utilize the same UUID value ("local-uuid" portion
   of the Session-ID header-value) for all participants of the cascaded
   conference.  An MCU conveys the UUID value to utilize via the "local-
   uuid" portion of the Session-ID header-value in an INVITE to a second
   MCU.

7. Processing by Intermediaries

   Intermediaries MUST NOT alter the UUID values found in the Session-ID
   header, except as described in this section.

   Intermediary devices that transfer a call, such as by joining
   together two different "call legs", MUST properly construct a
   Session-ID header that contains the correct UUID values and correct
   placement of those values.  As described above, the recipient of any
   message initiated by the intermediary will assume that the first UUID
   value belongs to the peer endpoint.

   If a SIP message having no Session-ID header is received by an
   intermediary, the intermediary MAY assign a "local-uuid" value to
   represent the sending endpoint and insert that value into all
   signaling messages on behalf of the sending endpoint.  If the
   intermediary is aware of a "remote" value that identifies the
   receiving UA, it MUST insert that value if also inserting the "local-
   uuid" value.

   Devices that initiate communication sessions following the procedures
   for third party call control MUST fabricate a UUID value that will be
   utilized only temporarily.  Once the responding endpoint provides a
   UUID value in a response message, the temporary value MUST be
   discarded and replaced with the endpoint-provided UUID value.  Refer
   to the third-party call control example for an illustration.

   Whenever there is a UA that does not implement this specification
   communicating through a B2BUA, the B2BUA MAY become dialog stateful
   and insert a UUID value into the Session-ID header on behalf of the
   UA according to the rules stated in Section 6.

   When intermediaries transmit provisional responses, such as 100
   Trying, they MUST be consistent with the text in Section 6 that
   discussed how endpoints are expected to receive a certain UUID value
   (say, either a "local-uuid" or "remote-uuid", but not both).  In
   provisional responses that have not reached their destination UAS to
   generate the other UUID value for that endpoint, intermediaries are
   to place the UAC's UUID value in the "remote-uuid" portion of the
   Session-ID header-value, and a null "local-uuid" value.

   A CANCEL request sent by an intermediary that has received no
   previous response from the target UA has a Session-ID constructed
   exactly like the INVITE to that UA, with only a "local-uuid" value in
   the Session-ID header-value.

8. Associating Endpoints in a Multipoint Conference

   Multipoint Control Units (MCUs) group two or more sessions into a
   single multipoint conference.  The MCU should utilize the same UUID
   value for each session that is grouped into the same conference.  In
   so doing, each individual session in the conference will have a
   unique Session Identifier (since each endpoint will create a unique
   UUID of its own), but will also have one UUID in common with all
   other participants in the conference.

   Intermediary devices, such as proxies or session border controllers,
   or network diagnostics equipment might assume that when they see two
   or more sessions with different Session Identifiers, but with one
   UUID in common, that the sessions are part of the same conference.

   Note, however, that this assumption of being part of the same
   conference is not always true.  For example, in a SIP forking
   scenario, there might also be what appears to be multiple sessions
   with a shared UUID value.  This is actually desirable.  What is
   desired is to allow for the association of related sessions.  Whether
   sessions are related because of forking or because endpoints are
   communicating as a part of a conference does not matter.  They are
   nonetheless related.

9. Various Call Flow Operations Utilizing the Session ID

   Seeing something frequently makes understanding easier. With that in
   mind, we include several call flow examples with the initial UUID and
   the complete Session ID indicated per message, as well as when the
   Session ID changes according to the rules within this document during
   certain operations/functions.

   This section is for illustrative purposes only and is non-normative.
   In the following flows, RTP refers to the Real-time Transport
   Protocol [RFC3550].

     o The originating transmitter of a SIP message populates the
       "local-uuid" portion of the Session-ID header-value.

     o UA-Alice sends its UUID in the SIP INVITE.

     o B2BUA receives an INVITE with a "local-uuid" portion of the
       Session-ID header-value from UA-Alice, and transmits INVITE
       towards UA-Bob with an unchanged Session-ID header-value.

     o UA-Bob receives Session-ID and adds its "local-uuid" portion of
       the Session-ID header-value UUID to construct the whole/complete
       Session-ID header-value, at the same time transferring Alice's
       UUID unchanged to the "remote-uuid" portion of the Session-ID
       header-value in the 200 OK SIP response.

     o B2BUA receives the 200 OK response with a complete Session-ID
       header-value from UA-Bob, and transmits 200 OK towards UA-Alice
       with an unchanged Session-ID header-value.

     o UA-Alice, upon reception of the 200 OK from the B2BUA, transmits
       the ACK towards the B2BUA. The construction of the Session-ID
       header-value in this ACK is that of Alice's UUID is the "local-
       uuid", and Bob's UUID populates the "remote-uuid" portion of the
       header-value.

     o B2BUA receives the ACK with a complete Session-ID header-value
       from UA-Alice, and transmits ACK towards UA-Bob with an
       unchanged Session-ID header-value.

                    Figure 2 - Call Transfer using REFER

   General operation of this example:

   Starting from the existing Alice/Bob call described in Figure 1 of
   this document, which established an existing Session-ID header-
   value...

     o UA-Bob reINVITEs Alice to call Carol, using a REFER transaction,
       as described in [RFC3515]. UA-Alice is initially put on hold,
       then told in the REFER who to contact with a new INVITE, in this
       case UA-Carol. This Alice-to-Carol dialog will have a new Call-
       ID, therefore it requires a new Session-ID header-value.  The
       wrinkle here is we can, and will, use Alice's UUID from her
       existing dialog with Bob in the new INVITE to Carol.

     o UA-Alice retains her UUID from the Alice-to-Bob call {A} when
       requesting a call with UA-Carol. This is placed in the "local-
       uuid" portion of the Session-ID header-value, with no "remote-
       uuid" value (because Carol's UA has not yet received the UUID
       value). This same UUID traverses the B2BUA unchanged.

     o UA-Carol receives the INVITE with a Session ID UUID {A}, moves
       this UUID value into the "remote-uuid" portion of the Session-ID
       header-value and creates its own UUID {C} and places this value
       in the "local-uuid" portion of the Session-ID header-value. This
       combination forms a full Session ID {C,A} in the 200 OK to the

       INVITE.  This Session-ID header-value traverses the B2BUA
       unchanged towards UA-Alice.

     o UA-Alice receives the 200 OK with the Session ID {C,A} and both
       responds to UA-Carol with an ACK (just as in Figure 1 - switches
       places of the two UUID fields), and generates a NOTIFY to Bob
       with a Session ID {A,B} indicating the call transfer was
       successful.

     o It does not matter which UA terminates the Alice-to-Bob call;
       Figure 2 shows UA-Bob doing this transaction.

9.3. Basic Call Transfer using reINVITE

   From the example built within Section 9.1 (the basic session ID
   establishment), we proceed to this 'Basic Call Transfer using
   reINVITE' example.

   Alice is talking to Bob. Bob pushes a button on his phone to transfer
   Alice to Carol via the B2BUA (using reINVITE).

                   Figure 3 - Call transfer using reINVITE

   General operation of this example:

     o We assume the call between Alice and Bob from Section 9.1 is
       operational with Session ID {A,B}.

     o Bob sends a reINVITE to Alice (with the Session-ID "local-uuid"
       = Bob's UUID and "remote-uuid" = Alice's UUID), informing her to
       transfer her existing call to Carol.

Internet-Draft          End-To-End Session ID                  July 2013


     o The B2BUA intercepts this reINVITE and sends a new INVITE with
       Alice's UUID {"local-uuid" = "A"} to Carol.

     o Carol receives the INVITE and accepts the request and adds her
       UUID {C} to the Session ID for this session {"local-uuid" = "C",
       "remote-uuid" = "A"}.

     o Bob terminates the call with a BYE using the Session ID {"local-
       uuid" = "B", "remote-uuid" = "A"}.  The B2BUA responds to Bob
       since Alice and Carol are now in a new call.

9.4. Single Focus Conferencing

   Multiple users call into a conference server (say, an MCU) to attend
   one of many conferences hosted on or managed by that server. Each
   user has to identify which conference they want to join, but this
   information is not necessarily in the SIP messaging.  It might be
   done by having a dedicated address for the conference or via an IVR,
   as assumed in this example. Each user in this example goes through a
   two-step process of signaling to gain entry onto their conference
   call.

                  Figure 4 - Single Focus Conference Bridge

   General operation of this example:

   Alice calls into a conference server to attend a certain conference.
   This is a two-step operation since Alice cannot include the
   conference ID at this time and/or any passcode in the INVITE request.
   The first step is Alice's UA calling another UA to participate in a
   session This will appear to be similar as the call-flow in Figure 1
   (in section 9.1). What is unique about this call is the second step:
   the conference server calls back with a reINVITE request with its
   second UUID, but maintaining the UUID Alice sent in the first INVITE.
   This subsequent UUID from the conference server will be the same for
   each UA that calls into this conference server participating in this
   same conference bridge/call, which is generated once Alice typically
   authenticates and identifies which bridge she wants to participate
   on.

     o Alice sends an INVITE to the conference server with her UUID
       {A}.

     o The conference server responds with a 200 OK response which
       includes a temporary UUID ("M1") as the "local-uuid" and a
       "remote-uuid" = "A".

     NOTE: this 'temporary' UUID is a real UUID; it is only temporary
     to the conference server because it knows that it is going to
     generate another UUID to replace the one just send in the 200 OK.

     o Once Alice, the user, gains access to the IVR for this
       conference server, she enters a specific conference ID and
       whatever passcode (if needed) to enter a specific conference
       call.

     o Once the conference server is satisfied Alice has identified
       which conference she wants to attend (including any passcode
       verification), the conference server reINVITEs Alice to the
       specific conference and includes the Session-ID header-value of
       "local-uuid" = "M'" (and "remote-uuid" = "A") for that
       conference. All valid participants in the same conference will
       receive this same UUID for identification purposes and to better
       enable monitoring, and tracking functions.

     o Bob goes through this two-step process of an INVITE transaction,
       followed by a reINVITE transaction to get this same UUID ("M'")
       for that conference.

     o In this example, Carol (and each additional user) goes through
       the same procedures and steps as Alice and Bob to get on this
       same conference.

                  Figure 5 - Single Focus Webex Conference

   General operation of this example:

     o Alice communicates with Webex server with desire to join a
       certain meeting, by meeting number; also includes UA-Alice's
       contact information (phone number, URI and/or IP address, etc.)
       for each device she wants for this conference call.  For
       example, the audio and video play-out devices could be separate
       units.

     o Conference Focus server sends INVITE (Session-ID header-value
       "local-uuid" = M, where M equals the "local-uuid" for each
       participant on this conference bridge) to UA-Alice to start
       session with the of that server for this A/V conference call.

     o Upon receiving the INVITE request from the conference focus
       server, Alice responds with a 200 OK. Her UA moves the "local-
       uuid" unchanged into the "remote-uuid" field, and generates her

       own UUID and places that into the "local-uuid" field to complete
       the Session-ID construction.

     o Bob and Carol perform same function to join this same A/V
       conference call as Alice.

9.6. Cascading Conference Bridge Support for the Session ID

   To expand conferencing capabilities requires cascading conference
   bridges. A conference bridge, or MCU, needs a way to identify itself
   when contacting another MCU. RFC 4579 [RFC4579] defines the 'isfocus'
   Contact: header parameter just for this purpose.

      Session ID
         ---     MCU-1            MCU-2            MCU-3           MCU-4
                   |                |                |               |
         {M'}      |----INVITE----->|                |               |
        {J,M'}     |<---200 OK------|                |               |
        {M',J}     |-----ACK------->|                |               |

          Figure 6 - MCUs Communicating Session ID UUID for Bridge

   Regardless of which MCU (1 or 2) a UA contacts for this conference,
   once the above exchange has been received and acknowledged, the UA
   will get the same M' UUID from the MCU for the complete Session ID.

   A more complex form would be a series of MCUs all being informed of
   the same UUID to use for a specific conference. This series of MCUs
   can either be informed

     o All by one MCU (that initially generates the UUID for the
       conference),

     o The one MCU that generates the UUID informs one or several MCUs
       of this common UUID, and they inform downstream MCUs of this
       common UUID each will be using for this one conference, or

       Figure 7 - MCU Communicating Session ID UUID to More than One

   General operation of this example:

     o The MCU generating the Session ID UUID communicates this in a
       separate INVITE, having a Contact header with the 'isfocus'
       header parameter. This will identify the MCU as what RFC 4579
       conference-aware SIP entity.

     o The MCU that is contacted, i.e., the UAS MCU, does not populate
       or complete the Session-ID header value. The UAS MCU transmits a
       200 OK response acknowledging it is to respond with this M' UUID
       to all requests for the designated conference.

     o An MCU that receives this M' UUID in an inter-MCU transaction,
       can communicate the M' UUID in a manner in which it was received
       (though this time this second MCU would be the UAC MCU), unless
       local policy dictates otherwise.

   General operation of this example:

     o Some out of band procedure directs a B2BUA (or other SIP server)
       to have Alice and Bob talk to each other.

     o The SIP server INVITEs Alice to a session and uses a temporary
       UUID {X}.

     o Alice receives and accepts this call set-up and includes her
       UUID {A} in the Session ID, now {A,X}.

     o The SIP server uses Alice's UUID {A}, and discards its own {X}
       to INVITE Bob to the session as if this came from Alice
       originally.

     o Bob receives and accepts this INVITE and adds his own UUID {B}
       to the Session ID, now {B,A} for the response.

     o And the session is established.

       Figure 9 - Session ID in the 100 Trying and CANCEL Messaging

Internet-Draft          End-To-End Session ID                  July 2013


   Below is the explanatory text from RFC 5359 Section 2.9 detailing
   what the desired behavior is in the above call flow (i.e., what the
   call-flow is attempting to achieve).

     "Bob wants calls to B1 forwarded to B2 if B1 is not answered
     (information is known to the SIP server).  Alice calls B1 and no
     one answers.  The SIP server then places the call to B2."

   General operation of this example:

     o Alice generates an INVITE request because she wants to invite
       Bob to join her session.  She creates a UUID as described in
       section 9.1, and places that value in the "local-uuid" field of
       the Session-ID header-value.

     o The SIP server (imagine this is a B2BUA), upon receiving Alice's
       INVITE, and generates the optional provisional response 100
       Trying.  Since the SIP server has no knowledge Bob's UUID for
       his part of the Session ID value, it cannot include his UUID.
       Rather, the 100 Trying response only includes Alice's UUID in
       the "remote-uuid" portion of the Session-ID header-value with a
       null "local-uuid" value in the response. This is consistent with
       what Alice's UA expects to receive in any SIP response
       containing this UUID.

9.8.2. Session ID in a CANCEL SIP Request

   In the same call-flow example as the 100 Trying response is a CANCEL
   request.  Please refer to Figure 9 for the CANCEL request example.

   General operation of this example:

     o In Figure 9 above, Alice generates an INVITE with her UUID value
       in the Session-ID header-value.

     o Bob-1 responds to this INVITE with a 180 Ringing.  In that
       response, he includes his UUID in the Session-ID header-value;
       thus completing the Session-ID header-value for this session,
       even though no final response has been generated by any of Bob's
       UAs.

     o This means that if the SIP server were to generate a SIP request
       within this session, in this case a CANCEL request, it would
       have a complete Session ID to include in that request. In this
       case, the "local-uuid" = "A", and the "remote-uuid" = "B1".

     o As it happens with this CANCEL, the SIP server intends to invite
       another UA of Bob for Alice to communicate with.

     o In this example call-flow, taken from RFC 5359, Section 2.9, a
       181 (Call is being Forwarded) response is sent to Alice.  Since

       the SIP server generated this SIP request, and has no knowledge
       of Bob-2's UUID value, it cannot include that value in this 181.
       Thus, and for the exact reasons the 100 Trying including the
       Session ID value, only Alice's UUID is included in the remote-
       uuid field of the Session-ID header-value, with a null UUID
       present in the "local-uuid" field.

9.9. Session ID in an out-of-dialog REFER Transaction

   The following call-flow was extracted from Section 6.1 of [RFC5589]
   ("Successful Transfer"), with the only changes being the names of the
   UAs to maintain consistency within this document.

     o Just as in Section 9.2, Figure 2, Alice invites Bob to a
       session, and Bob eventually transfers Alice to communicate with
       Carol.

     o What is different about the call-flow in Figure 10 is that Bob's
       REFER is not in-dialog, meaning it would have the same UUID
       pair.  Rather, in this case, Bob's using an out-of-dialog REFER,
       meaning Bob generates a new UUID for this SIP request, and
       Alice, subsequently would also generate a new UUID for the 202
       (Accepted) response.

     o Alice will use her existing UUID "A" in the INVITE towards Carol
       (who generates UUID "C" for this session), thus maintaining the
       common UUID within the Session ID for this new Alice-to-Carol
       session.

10. Compatibility with a Previous Implementation

   There is a much earlier and proprietary document that specifies the
   use of a Session-ID header that we will herewith attempt to achieve
   backwards compatibility. Neither Session-ID has any versioning
   information, so merely adding that this document describes "version
   2" is insufficient. Here are the set of rules for compatibility
   between the two specifications. For the purposes of this discussion,
   we will label the proprietary specification of the Session-ID as the
   "old" version and this specification as the "new" version of the
   Session-ID.

   The previous (i.e., "old") version only has a single value as a
   Session-ID, but has a generic-parameter value that can be of use.

   In order to have an "old" version talk to an "old" version
   implementation, nothing needs to be done as far as the IETF is
   concerned.

   In order to have a "new" version talk to a "new" version
   implementation, both implementations need to following this document
   (to the letter) and everything should be just fine.

   In order to have an "old" version talk to a "new" version
   implementation, several aspects need to be looked at. They are:

     o The "old" version UA will include a single UUID as its Session-
       ID.

     o The "new" version UA will respond by including a complete
       Session-ID with two UUIDs, with the "new" version's UUID listed
       first (because it cannot know it is talking with an "old"
       version implementation at this point).

     o The "old" version UA will have to ignore the first UUID, and
       consider its singular "old" UUID as valid, as long as the value
       does not change.

     o During subsequent transactions within this session, the "new"
       version may receive SIP requests without its UUID, but with the
       "old" version's UUID. The "new" version UA MUST add its UUID to
       the received Session-ID. The "old" version implementation will
       merely disregard it each time it receives this "new" version
       UUID (if it was not the first UUID).

   In order to have a "new" version talk to an "old" Version
   implementation, several aspects need to be looked at. They are:

     o The "new" version UA will include a single UUID as its initial
       Session-ID header always, not knowing which version of UA it is
       communicating with.

     o The "old" version UA will respond by seeing the UUID as a valid
       and complete Session-ID and not include another UUID or generic-
       param.  Thus, the 200 OK will not include any Session-ID part of
       its own from the "old" version implementation.

     Rule: implementation supporting a "new" version of the Session-ID
       MUST NOT error or otherwise reject receiving only its own UUID
       back in any transaction. It MUST interpret this response to mean
       that it is communicating with an "old" Session-ID
       implementation.

     o Open question - how do we want all intermediaries and/or
       monitoring systems to interpret this single UUID complete
       Session-ID?

11. Security Considerations

   When creating a UUID value, endpoints SHOULD ensure that there is no
   user or device-identifying information contained within the UUID.  In
   some environments, though, use of a MAC address, which is one option
   when constructing a UUID, may be desirable, especially in some
   enterprise environments.  When communicating over the Internet,
   though, the UUID value MUST utilize random values.

   The Session Identifier might be utilized for logging or
   troubleshooting, but MUST NOT be used for billing purposes.

   Other considerations???

12. IANA Considerations

12.1. Registration of the "Session-ID" Header Field

   The following is the registration for the 'Session-ID' header field
   to the "Header Name" registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-
   parameters:

   RFC number: RFC XXXX

   Header name: 'Session-ID'

   Compact form: none

   [RFC Editor: Please replace XXXX in this section and the next with
   the this RFC number of this document.]

12.2. Registration of the "remote" Parameter

   The following parameter is to be added to the "Header Field
   Parameters and Parameter Values" section of the SIP parameter
   registry:

   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
   | Header Field     | Parameter Name | Predefined Values | Reference |
   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
   | Session-ID       | remote         | No                | [RFCXXXX] |
   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
