Abstract

   RFC4090 defines an RSVP fast reroute mechanism for local repairing
   LSP tunnel in the order of 10s milliseconds, in the event of a
   downstream link or node failure.  However, the mechanism does not
   provide node protection for LSP egress nodes.  This document
   describes two methods to establish a bypass LSP from the penultimate-
   hop node of an LSP to a backup egress node, which could be used to
   protect the LSP against egress node failure.  The methods enable
   local repair in the order of 10s of millisecond, in the event of the
   egress node failure.  These methods are only applicable if traffic
   carried by the LSP could be rerouted to ultimate destination by the
   backup egress node.

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE LSP egress fast-protection-00         Oct 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document define two methods that could enable fast protection
   for egress node failure for RSVP-TE signaled LSP tunnels.  Both
   methods have a common concept of primary egress node and backup
   egress node for a tunnel endpoint address.  The methods differ by how
   tunnel endpoints are modeled in the network.  The primary egress node
   of an LSP (called protected LSP) terminates the LSP in steady state,
   while a bypass LSP is established from the penultimate-hop node to
   the backup egress node.  The penultimate-hop node, serving as a PLR
   (point of local repair), redirects traffic to the backup egress node
   of the LSP via the bypass LSP in the event of primary egress node
   failure, and the backup egress node forwards the traffic to the
   ultimate destination.  How the backup egress node forwards traffic is
   beyond the scope this document.  For one example, the backup egress
   node could mirror from the primary egress node the inner labels (e.g.
   layer-2/3 VPN service labels) carried by the traffic, and forward the
   traffic based on those labels by using the mechanisms specified in
   [pwe3-endpoint-fast-protection] and [l3vpn-egress PE-fast-
   protection].

   the primary egresses for 4 LSPs, R7 is backup egress and R5 is
   penultimate hop node for all LSPs.  R5 establish bypass LSP to R7 for
   fast protection to handle the R6 or R8 failure.  Below table shows
   the protected LSP and bypass LSP in R5.

   Two methods defined in the documents that enable the backup LSP to
   establish to backup egress.

   a.  Proxy node method

   b.  Alias method

   In the proxy method, an LSP endpoint address is represent as a
   virtual node in the TE domain attached to the primary egress node and
   the backup egress node via bidirectional point-to-point TE links.
   With this representation, the penultimate-hop node of the LSP could
   use the normal procedure of RSVP fast-reroute PLR to set up a bypass
   LSP to the backup egress node, by avoiding the primary egress node.
   This methed has the advantage of not requiring software upgrade on
   the penultimate-hop node, and thus can ease the deployment this
   technology.

                                 Figure 2

   With proxy method, topology is modeled as figure 2 in the rest of the
   network for LSP destination address x which required egress
   protection and R6 is primary R7 is backup.

   In alias method, an LSP endpoint address is associated with an
   dedicated IP address on the backup egress node.  This IP address is
   called an alias.  The penultimate-hop node of the LSP may learn the
   alias via IGP or configuration, and use it as the destination when
   computing a path for the bypass LSP.  With this method, the
   penultimate-hop node can set up a bypass LSP to the backup egress
   node, by avoiding the primary egress node.  This method requires
   software upgrade penultimate-hop node, but is flexile to support all

4.  Proxy method

   In this method, an LSP endpoint address is represented as a virtual
   TE node connected to a primary egress node and a backup egress node
   with bidirectional TE links, as shown figure 1.  With this model,
   node protection establishment and bypass LSP path computation on the
   penultimate hop of an LSP can follow the procedure described in
   RFC4090.

4.1.  Tunnel destination Advertisement in IGP

   Tunnel destination advertised as stub proxy TE node required two
   parts.  A node representation (proxy-node) and links to and from
   primary egress and backup egress..

      The primary advertises proxy node with two links to primary egress
      and backup egress, respectively.  The router ID of the proxy node
      is LSP end point address.  The system-ID is derived from the LSP
      end point address with BCD encoding.  The resulting system-ID and
      router-ID MUST be unique with in IGP routing domain.  Both stub
      links are advertised with maximum routable metric and TE metric,
      and zero bandwidth.  This avoids the proxy node serve as a transit
      node for any paths.  The router-ID or system-ID of the protector
      could be dynamically learned from IGP link state database or could
      be configured in primary.

      The primary egress advertises an unnumbered transit link to the
      proxy node, with metric 1, TE metric 1, and maximum bandwidth.  It

      may be necessary for the primary node to have the capabilities to
      advertise multiple TE unnumbered transit links between primary
      node and proxy-node.  The upper bound on the number of such links
      is the number of the links the primary node advertises into TE.

      The backup egress advertises an unnumbered transit link to the
      proxy node, with MAX metric, MAX TE metric, and zero bandwidth.
      Other TE characteristic of the links could be configured and
      advertised in to TE.

4.1.1.  ISIS proxy-node (Non-Normative)

   Only zeroth fragment of the proxy-node is only valid.  All Other
   fragments SHOULD be ignored.  Zeroth fragment MUST include area
   address TLV and MAY include hostname TLV.

   The set of area addresses advertised MUST be a subset of the set of
   Area Addresses advertised in the protected LSP number zero at the
   corresponding level.  Preferably, the advertisement SHOULD be
   syntactically identical to that included in the normal LSP number
   zero at the corresponding level.  The hostname could be set as
   <tunnel-destination + protected hostname>.

   The Overload (OL) MUST be set to 1.  The Attached (ATT), and
   Partition Repair (P) bits MUST be set to 0.

4.1.2.  OSPF proxy-node (Non-Normative)

   The advertising router and Link State ID of router LSA be LSP end
   point address.  All options bits in router LSA MUST be set to zero.
   The number of links MUST be 2

4.2.  Ingress Node Behavior

   The ingress node of an LSP should follow same procedure in RFC 2205
   and RFC 4090 to signal the LSP.  In particular, it should set the
   destination to the endpoint address (i.e. the proxy node), and the
   "link protection desired" flag and the "node protection desired" flag
   in SESSION_ATTRIBUTE of Path message.  In path computation, it MAY
   optionally set not to use MAX metric link, as another constraint, to
   avoid the link between the backup egress and the proxy node.

4.3.  Primary Egress Node Behavior

   When the primary egress node receives Path message for the LSP with
   destination matching the proxy node address, it MUST append two
   entities in the RRO object of Resv message, first for the proxy node
   as a virtual downstream node, and second for itself as virtual

   transit node.  The entity for the proxy node is encoded as {proxy
   node address, proxy link ID, implicit NULL}.

4.4.  Penultimate Hop Node

   When the penultimate hop node receives Resv message from primary
   egress, it sees itself as two hops away from LSP's destination rather
   than one hop, based on the RRO.  Thus, it can set up node protection
   for the LSP by following the procedure described in RFC 4090.  It
   SHOULD set up a bypass LSP to the backup egress node.  When computing
   a path for bypass LSP, it SHOULD avoid the primary egress node and
   choose a path via the backup egress node to reach the proxy node.

4.4.1.  Backup LSP Signaling during Local Repair

   The penultimate hop node SHOULD uses the same procedure as defined
   RFC4090 to signal the backup Path, in the event of failure of the
   primary egress node.

4.5.  Backup Egress Node Behavior

   When the backup egress node receives the Path message of the bypass
   LSP, it MUST terminate the Path message based on the match bewteen
   the LSP destination and the proxy node address.  It SHOULD assign a
   non-reserved label to the bypass LSP, and point the label to a
   specific label table where the labels learned from the primary egress
   node are installed.  This can facilitate forwarding of traffic when
   the backup egress node receives traffic over the bypass LSP during
   local repair.  In this case, the traffic will be carrying inner
   labels assigned by the primary egress node, and a further label
   lookup in the specific label table SHOULD enable the backup egress
   node to forward traffic to the ultimate destination.

4.5.1.  Backup LSP Signaling during Local Repair

   During local repair, the backup egress node will receive Path message
   of backup LSP from the penultimate hop node.  The backup egress node
   SHOULD terminate the Path message, and respond with a Resv message.

4.6.  Pros/Cons

   Pros

   1.  Protocol extension not required.  Changes required only in tunnel
       egress nodes.  Core router software upgrade required is not
       required.

   Cons

   1.  To support TE constrains like colors and SRLG for a protected LSP
       the primary need to have capability to advertise multiple links
       to between proxy and primary.

   2.  Bypass LSP with constrains cant be supported.

   3.  If ISIS used as IGP then Primary node should not configured with
       overload bit.

   4.  if OSPF as IGP then a Proxy node could be used in transit even if
       primary is down.

   5.  Protector could be used as primary end point in the forwarding
       plane if the protected LSP established to protector instead of
       primary in transient condition


5.  Alias  model

   In this model Penultimate hop node understand tunnel end point has a
   backup egress which is may not protected LSP path and backup egress
   could repair traffic carried protected LSP in the event of primary
   egress failure.  After primary egress failure PHN reroute using
   bypass tunnel to backup egress.  The tunnel endpoint address and
   backup egress mapping could be configured in penultimate hop node or
   signaled through IGP from the backup.  Following table illustrate the
   PNH mapping primary to backup mapping for the figure 1.

5.1.  Head-End Behavior

   Ingress should follow same procedure in RFC 3209 with tunnel endpoint
   address and path computation could use RFC 5786 advertised tunnel
   endpoint address.

5.2.  Primary Egress node

   Primary egress node advertises tunnel end points that required
   protection using RFC 5786 in OSPF and/or IP interface addresses
   TLV(132) in ISIS.  These TLVs are defines as Local address
   advertisement in TE.  And rest of behavior is same RFC 4090.

5.3.  Backup egress node

   When backup receives a Path message not through a bypass tunnel for a
   destination address it protects with ERO constains only one self sub
   objects then it MUST accept and respond with RRO objects in Resv
   message.  The RRO object {node ID, Ip address, label} for tunnel end
   address set with {Node ID, tunnel endpoint address, non-NULL}.  This
   non-NULL will be used for identify LSP it protects in forwarding.
   Backup could also signals protection availability for tunnel end
   point addresses through IGP.

5.3.1.  Procedures for the Backup egress during Local Repair

   The Backup egress sends Resv, ResvTear, and PathErr messages by
   sending them directly to the address in the RSVP_HOP object, as
   specified in [RSVP-TE].

5.3.2.  Processing Backup Tunnel's ERO

   When backup receive Path message through a bypass tunnel with one
   sub-object for destination address it protects then it should accept
   ERO.

5.4.  Penultimate hop node

   PLR learns/configured backup egress for tunnel a end point address
   advertised by primary egress.  When PLR setup bypass for node
   protection LSP it will also lookup for the backup egress if PLR is
   penultimate hop of the LSP.  If backup egress is available for LSP
   tunnel end point address then it setup bypass-LSP to backup egress if
   it is not setup already.  The constrains will be exclude egress node.
   PNH could setup bypass-LSP with destination as backup egress node or
   tunnel endpoint address.  If the bypass tunnel endpoint address is
   not the protected LSP tunnel endpoint then it also initiates backup
   LSP for tunnel end point address through bypass tunnel to learn the
   label to use in failure.

5.4.1.  Signaling a Backup Path

   PHP SHALL uses the same procedure as defined RFC4090 to signal the
   backup Path.

5.4.2.  Procedures for Backup Path Computation

   PLR has to find the desired explicit route for the backup path.  This
   can be done using a CSPF computation.  If PLR is PNH for the
   protected LSP needs node protection then destination for backup path
   MUST be backup egress router ID with constrain that LSP cannot
   traverse the primary egress node and/or link whose failure is being
   protected against.  For other constrains SHOULD follow RFC4090.

5.4.3.  Signaling for Facility Protection

   A PHN use one or more bypass tunnels to protect against the failure
   of a egress primary node.  This bypass tunnels set up in advance or
   dynamically created as new protected LSPs are signaled.

5.4.3.1.  Discovering Downstream Labels

   To support facility backup, the PHN must determine the label that
   will indicate to the backup egress that packets received with that
   label should be processed by primary egress context.  This can be
   done by explicitly signaling backup path before failure or setup the
   UHP bypass tunnel to backup egress with tunnel endpoint address as
   destination.

5.4.3.2.  Processing Backup Tunnel's ERO

   Sub-objects belonging to abstract nodes that precede the tunnel
   endpoint Point are removed.  A sub-object identifying the Backup
   Tunnel destination is then added.

5.4.3.3.  PLR Procedures during Local Repair

   PHN SHALL uses the same procedure as defined RFC4090 during the local
   repair.

5.5.  Pros/Cons

   Pro

   1.  Will work with any TE constrains

   Cons

   1.  Protocol changes required in RSVP.  Also IGP extension required
       to avoid PLR static protector configuration.
