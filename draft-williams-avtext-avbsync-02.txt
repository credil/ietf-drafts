1.  Outline

   Alternative approach

   Use existing header extension for timestamps.  (RFC 6051)

   Create additional small header extension for metadata (traceability,
   uncertainty, media clock discontinuity).

   IDMS wants accurate timing too and has a method for describing
   clocks.  Create a single specification for signalling clock domains
   which covers both use cases.  IDMS can use that too.


2.  Introduction

   Synchronisation between RTP flows and between devices rendering RTP
   flows is currently facilitated by means of NTP format timestamps
   taken with respect to a shared reference clock.  In many applications
   (e.g. professional, commercial and automotive AV), the NTP clock
   synchronisation protocol does not meet the necessary time alignment
   and synchronisation speed requirements.

   Like NTP, the IEEE1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) family of clock
   synchronisation protocols provide a shared reference clock in an
   network - typically a LAN.  IEEE1588 provides sub-microsecond
   synchronisation between devices on a LAN and typically locks within
   seconds at startup rather than minutes.  With support from Ethernet
   switches, IEEE1588 protocols can achieve nanosecond timing accuracy
   in LANs.  Network interface chips and cards supporting hardware time-
   stamping of timing critical protocol messages are also available.

   When using IEEE1588 clock synchronisation, networked AV systems can
   achieve sub 1 microsecond time alignment accuracy when rendering AV
   signals and can support latencies less than 1ms through a gigabit
   LAN.

   Three flavours of IEEE1588 are in use today:

   o  IEEE 1588-2002 [4]: the original "Standard for a Precision Clock
      Synchronization Protocol for Networked Measurement and Control
      Systems".  This is often called IEEE1588v1 or PTPv1.

   o  IEEE 1588-2008 [5]: the second version of the "Standard for a
      Precision Clock Synchronization Protocol for Networked Measurement
      and Control Systems".  This is a revised version of the original
      IEEE1588-2002 standard and is often called IEEE1588v2 or PTPv2.

   o  IEEE 802.1AS [6]: "Timing and Synchronization for Time Sensitive
      Applications in Bridged Local Area Networks".  This is a Layer-2
      only profile of IEEE 1588-2008 for use in Audio/Video Bridged
      LANs.

   By using an IEEE 1588 derived reference clock, synchronisation of RTP
   streams and devices in LANs can be considerably improved.


3.  Reference Clocks and Clock Domains

   RTP uses NTP format timestamps to exchange information about media
   clock timing.  NTP timestamps may come from a clock which is
   synchronised to a global time reference, but this is not assumed nor
   is there a standardised mechanism available to indicate that
   timestamps are derived from a common reference clock.  Therefore, RTP
   implementations typically assume that NTP timestamps are taken using
   unsynchronised clocks and must compensate for absolute time
   differences and rate differences.  Without a shared reference clock,
   RTP can time align flows from the same source at a given receiver
   using relative timing, however tight synchronisation between two or
   more different receivers (possibly with different network paths) or
   between two or more senders is not possible.

   Each IEEE1588 clock is identified by a globally unique EUI-64 called
   a "ClockIdentity".  A slave clock using one of the IEEE1588 family of
   network time protocols acquires the ClockIdentity/EUI-64 of the
   grandmaster clock that is the ultimate source of timing information.
   A master clock which is itself slaved to another master clock passes
   the grand master clock identity through to its slaves.  The
   grandmaster clock identity can be used to identify a set of clocks in
   a single clock domain.

   The IEEE1588 protocol family also carries an indication that the
   grand master clock provides traceable time.  Traceablility of a time
   source implies that the clock is ultimately slaved to a global time
   source (e.g.  GPS).  A slave may consider one or more grandmaster
   clocks providing traceable time as belonging to the same (global)
   clock domain.  Informally, traceabiliity trumps ClockIdentity when
   comparing clock domains.  Traceable time is particularly applicable
   for wide area applications such as broadcast, transport and
   reflection seismology.

   Several instances of the IEEE1588v1/v2 protocol may operate
   independently on a single network, forming distinct PTP network
   protocol domains each of which may have a different master clock.  As
   the IEEE1588 standards have developed, the definition of PTP domains
   has changed.  IEEE1588v1 identifies protocol subdomains by a textual

   name and IEEE1588v2 identifies protocol domains using a numeric
   domain number. 802.1AS is a Layer2 profile of IEEE1588v2 supporting a
   single numeric clock domain (0).  This specification assumes that an
   IEEE1588 clock master for multiple domains will provide the same
   timing information to all domains or that each clock domain has a
   different master.  In other words, this specification assumes that a
   timing domain can be uniquely identified using the ClockIdentity of
   the grandmaster clock alone.

   Accurate signal playout time alignment and accurate capture of input
   signal phase relationships are important requirements for A/V
   systems.  In distributed AV systems containing many senders/receivers
   and differing network path lengths, a shared reference clock
   providing absolute time is needed.  Relative timing using
   unsychronised clocks cannot provide the required level of time
   alignment (+/- 1us).


4.  Timestamp formats

   IEEE 1588/802.1AS timestamps use International Atomic Time (TAI)
   rather than UTC.  Timestamps are 80 bits in total, divided into two
   parts:

      PTP_sec: 48 bits seconds since epoch

      PTP_nsec: 32 bits nanoseconds

   A shorter 32 bit timestamp has also been defined for use in streaming
   media protocols in the following way:

      as_timestamp = (PTP_sec * 10^9 + PTP_nsec) modulo 2^32

   The shorter as_timestamp field covers a time interval slightly larger
   than 4 seconds.


5.  IEEE 1733 / AVB RTCP Packet Type

   IEEE 1733 [7] defines the "AVB RTCP packet" type reproduced in
   Figure 1.  RTCP AVB packets contain a mapping between RTP timestamp
   and an 802.1AS timestamp as well as additional clock and QoS
   information.

   The RTCP packet type shown below provides the corresponding IEEE1588
   timestamp for an RTP timestamp in a similar fashion to an RTCP Sender
   Report (SR).  In addition, the source of the timing information (i.e.
   the grandmaster ClockIdentity) is included.  Clock domain information

   allows an RTP implementation to determine whether sender and receiver
   timestamps have been taken using a shared reference clock.  If the
   sender and receiver share a common clock domain, timestamps and be
   used and compared in an absolute sense.

   gmTimeBaseIndicator  This field identifies the clock master time
      base.  The gmTimeBaseIndicator increments each time a step change
      in time or frequency occurs.  If the value of the
      gmTimeBaseIndicator and gmIdentity in the RTCP packet (i.e., of
      the sender) match the gmTimeBaseIndicator and gmIdentity at the
      receiver, the receiver is assured that timestamps have been taken
      using a shared reference clock.  If they do not match, actions
      performed by the receiver are application dependent but may
      include entering a holdover mode until a positive match is again
      achieved.

   gmPortNumber  An integer identifying the port used on a grand master.

   gmClockIdentity  An EUI-64 identifying the grand master clock used by
      the source to generate as_timestamps for this flow.

   stream_id  A 64 bit number identifying the 802.1Qat [8] QoS
      reservation associated with this RTP flow.

   as_timestamp  The 32 bit 802.1AS timestamp (Section 4) associated
      with the RTP timestamp carried in this packet.

   rtp_timestamp  The RTP timestamp of a media packet.

   Please consult the IEEE 1733 specification [7] for more details.

5.1.  Observations

   The RTCP packet type above provides the basic information for linking
   IEEE1588 time to RTP timestamps, however there are some additions
   which would improve the functionality provided.

   The IEEE1733 specifcation does not define any SDP signalling.  This
   means that the QoS parameters (ie the stream_id) cannot be signalled
   at call/flow setup time using SIP/RTSP.  Whilst IEEE1733 provides
   clock domain information, it doesn't really define how clock domains
   work.  Further, IEEE1733 does not include metadata to indicate clock
   changes.  This specification addresses each of these issues.

5.2.  RTCP Packet Subtypes

   Systems not using the full AVB protocol suite can still benefit from
   timing improvements offered by IEEE 1588v1 and IEEE 1588v2.  In
   general, the IEEE 1733 / AVB RTCP packet format (Figure 1) can be
   used to relate RTP timestamp instants in media packets to a reference
   clock provided by any of the IEEE 1588/PTP family of clock
   synchronisation protocols.

   The subtype field indicates which IEEE 1588 protocol was used by the
   timestamping clock:

   0x00  IEEE 802.1AS (defined by IEEE 1733)

   0x01  IEEE 1588v1

   0x02  IEEE 1588v2

6.  Timing Header Extension

   The header extension shown below provides a combination of media
   timestamps and timing metadata.

   The provision of IEEE1588 timestamps in the RTP header is analogous
   to the existing NTP timestamp header extension supporting rapid
   synchonisation of RTP flows.  High performance systems often handle
   RTP media packets in hardware and carriage of timing metadata in the
   media packets provides increased performance (e.g. faster lock times)
   and simplifies the system.  In contrast to using RTCP, a header
   extension guarantees that timing metadata arrives at the receiver
   with the first media packet allowing them to be processed
   immediately.  This approach facilitates fast switching between
   sources as is commonly used in zoned paging applications.

   If the sender and receiver share a clock domain, source timestamps in
   media packets facilitate the collection of high quality information
   about the actual delays experienced by media packets through the
   network.  Accurate delay information is important for diagnosing
   operational problems and for system optimisation.

   The metadata included in the header allows senders to signal changes
   in clock disposition to receivers.  Since IEEE1588 uses an election
   mechanism to determine the clock master it is possible for the master
   and/or grand master to change during the transmission of an RTP flow.
   Changing from one master clock to another may involve changes in
   clock frequency and/or phase.  Additionally, the election protocol is
   not guaranteed to complete at the same time at all nodes in the clock
   domain, so there will be a transition period during which timestamps
   at the sender and receiver are not directly comparable.  A sender
   indicates changes in IEEE1588 clocking by setting the timestamp
   uncertain (U) bit in the header.  For example, the bit may be set
   when the best master clock election process is triggered due to loss
   of the current master clock.  Once set, this bit should remain set
   during the entire period where PTP timing is in flux and for at least
   5 seconds after PTP timing has stabilised (5 seconds allows
   as_timestamps which cover about 4 seconds to be disambiguated).  When
   PTP timestamps are uncertain the receiver may refrain from updating
   the rtp_timestamp to wallclock mapping, effectively processing
   packets on the basis of rtp_timestamp alone.

   In AV systems, media clocks are often provided via an external
   connection.  When a media clock is disconnected or switched from one
   source to another (e.g. between two different SP/DIF ports),
   synchronisation may be lost and noise may be generated.  A sender can
   indicate the loss of a media clock for a transmitted signal by
   toggling the media clock restart (M) bit.  A receiver may use a

Internet-Draft           AVB/RTP Synchronisation            October 2011


   change in the media clock restart bit to mute audio or to hold a
   frame or to trigger resynchronisation to the new media clock.

   In some systems, senders and receivers are on different networks with
   different grand master clocks however they may be part of a single
   global clock domain that uses traceable time.  A sender can indicate
   that media packet timestamps have been taken with a traceable clock
   by setting T=1.  Since it is possible for a PTP clock master to
   change during an RTP flow, the T bit may change.  For example, if the
   traceable grand master clock used by the sender fails, PTP will elect
   a new grand master which may not be slaved to a global time source.
   In systems where traceable time is important, all candidate PTP
   masters should support traceable time and media signals timestamps
   should be clearly marked as traceable or not traceable.  If
   timestamps are not traceable, T MUST be set to zero.

   Figure 2 shows the fields of the AVB sync header extension.  It uses
   the standard RTP header extension mechanism defined in RFC 5285 [2].

   M  Toggling the value of the media clock restart field (M) indicates
      a change in the source of the media clock.  This kind of change
      need not be seamless but allows the receiver to take any
      appropriate action to minimize the disruption to the stream.  The
      value of the M bit is toggled once by the sender each time the
      media clock source is changed.  Toggling the bit rather than
      setting/resetting ensures media clock restarts will not be missed
      if it were to appear in a single RTP packet which happens to be
      dropped.

   U  The sender sets U=1 to indicate that timestamps may not be
      globally synchronized with network time.  An example is the
      invocation of the best master clock algorithm because of a PTP
      SYNC timeout .  Receivers may use the U bit, possibly in
      conjunction with their knowledge of the status of the PTP clock,
      to prevent unacceptable disturbances in the recovered media
      streams.

   subtype  See Section 5.2.

   as_timestamp  A 32 bit IEEE 1588/802.1AS timestamp as defined in
      Section 4.

   reserved  As this specification evolves, additional fields may be
      included in this header.

   The as_timestamp MUST correspond to the same instant as the RTP
   timestamp in the packet's header, and MUST be derived from the same
   clock used to generate the as_timestamps in the RTCP AVB packets.
   Provided that it has knowledge of the SSRC to CNAME mapping, either
   from prior receipt of an RTCP CNAME packet or via out of band
   signalling such as RFC 5576 [3], the receiver can use the information
   provided as input to the synchronization algorithm, in exactly the
   same way as if an additional RTCP AVB packet had been received for
   the flow.


7.  SDP signalling

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) allows clock domain and QoS
   information to be signalled via SIP or RTSP at call setup time.  In
   the case of SIP, changes in information can also be signalled during
   the RTP session.

7.1.  Clock domain

   General format for signalling clock domains (todo: convert to EBNF):

   a=clockdomain:ptp-version=PTP-PROTOCOL gmid=EUI-64 traceable=YES-OR-NO


   Examples:
   a=clockdomain:ptp-version=IEEE1588v1 gmid=39-A7-94-FF-FE-07-CB-D0 traceable=yes

   a=clockdomain:ptp-version=IEEE1588v2 gmid=39-A7-94-FF-FE-07-CB-D0 traceable=yes

   a=clockdomain:ptp-version=802.1AS gmid=39-A7-94-FF-FE-07-CB-D0 traceable=no


7.2.  Quality of Service

   General format for signalling AVB QoS to a receiver:
                       a=8021qat-qos:stream-id=EUI-64


   Example:
              a=8021qat-qos:stream-id=00-1D-C1-97-BB-3A-01-01



8.  An Alternative Approach

   Some RTP specifications already exists which cover aspects of the
   functionality described in this specification.  Most notably, there
   is a specification for a header extension allowing NTP format
   timestamps to be included in RTP media packet headers (RFC 6051).

   In addition, some new work
   (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-avtcore-idms-02) specifies a
   mechanism for describing clock sources including those based on IEEE
   1588.

   Rather developing new specifications based on the 32 bit as_timestamp
   format, an alternative approach which could fulfil the goals of this
   specification could be to:

   1.  Use the existing RFC 6051 to carry timestamps in RTP media
       packets (nothing to be done).

   2.  Create a new specification describing clock sources/domains and
       their signalling that is independent of both this specification
       and the IDMS specification.  This would allow clock domains to be
       signalled generally in RTP.  This might be done in avtcore.

   3.  Create a new specification augmenting RFC 6051 which carries the
       timing metadata (ptp uncertainty, media clock change,

       traceability).

   4.  This specification: the header extension and clock domain
       signally go into other documents.  There may be some remaining
       text describing how AVB systems in particular would use the above
       mechanisms.


9.  IANA Considerations

   TBD: A URN will be required to signal the presence of this header
   extension, such as:

      urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:avb-sync


10.  Acknowledgements

   The timing metadata (U and M) bits were inspired by the IEEE 1722
   specification.
