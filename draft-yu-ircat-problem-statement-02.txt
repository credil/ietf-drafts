1.  Introduction

   To achieve massive scalability, routers are being evolved and growing
   larger and larger in size.  One way to achieve very high scalability
   is to design and deploy tightly-coupled homogeneous hardware cluster
   router.

   Currently, the tightly-coupled cluster router with homogeneous
   hardware requires the same type of routers from the same vendor.

   As an alternative, using different routers (maybe from different
   vendors) to construct a loosely-coupled heterogeneous cluster router
   by running one or more protocols (based on IETF standards) is a
   reasonable approach.

   The key point of such a technology is about Cooperation and Teaming
   among routers.

   The cooperation includes, but not limited to, such a scenario in
   which one router may handle some control plane work on behalf of
   another router.  From the outside, the cooperative router team is
   required to meet the following minimal requirements:

   o  The group is viewed as a single virtualized router with a router
      ID and operated as a single network node.

   o  The router is always available and some redundancy and backups are
      built between routers joining the same router team.

   o  The router is extremely highly scalable as a new router can be
      inserted to join such a group when needed.


2.  Terminology

   IRCAT:Inter Router Cooperative and Teaming


3.  Inter Cooperative Router Team

   To meet the massive scalability requirements from the newly emerging
   applications, the single chassis router faces tough time.  Even
   though CPU speed and memory capacity continue to grow at a fast pace,
   building a giant route is still expensive.  The single giant router
   loses the flexibility of seamlessly scaling from low to high.

   An alternate paradigm is to create giant routers out of multiple
   heterogeneous routers in a loosely coupled group.  The router can be

   heterogeneous in the CPU, the type of line cards, their functionality
   or their origin.  For example, some routers in the group can have
   line cards with 100 Gig cards and others can have 10 Gig cards.

   The routers participate in a team of routers much like the US
   football team or a South American football team (soccer).  Each of
   the team members in the router team tell other members about their
   special capabilities.  Just like on the US football team, the team
   members share about their capabilities (punting or blocking) so the
   team can win the football game.

   The team members join/leave the team.  This function can be via
   multicast protocols or other dynamic group joining protocols.

   The team members also cooperate to provide the service in a
   distributive fashion.  Again, to use the football analogy the team
   members collaborate to do the task of moving the ball down the field.
   The team members also tell each other about the dynamic changes in
   topology.

   For the purpose of discussion we denote the grouping multiple routers
   inter router cooperative group.

   In the cooperative router team, the routers are not required to be of
   the same type.

   The Router Member can be heterogeneous or homogeneous routers.

3.1.  Examples of the Router topologies

   The router topologies can be in any type of topology.  The next three
   figures show three examples: ring, partial mesh, and full mesh.
   These examples are shown in a flat topology, but any type of topology
   (hierarchy or flat or mixed) should be able to be supported.

   In each example, the router as a group has an ID and exterior
   addresses.  View from the outside, the rest of the world sees the
   router team as a single identity.  Viewed from the inside, the
   routers in the router team see each other's Team ID and member ID
   within the team.  Again an analogy from South American Football
   (soccer) may help.  The team is the Red soccer team.  The forwarder
   Pascal has a 14 on his jersey.

   Figure 1 is the illustration of router team.  The router team has a
   single router ID and a set of exterior addresses as public
   information.  The group router members have private interior router
   ID and interior addresses for internal interconnection.

       Figure 3: Cooperative Router Team with Partial Mesh Topology

   The connections between the router members can be at a single layer
   (layer 3 or layer 2) or multiple layers (1-4).  Cooperative router
   team is truly cooperative.  The Router Members collaboratively agree
   to work on some set of tasks.  The tasks may have characteristics
   like CPU, memory, and time of day.  Or the tasks may have specific
   goals like NAT or firewall.

   Let's stretch the football analogy a little further.  Sometimes a US
   football team is on the defensive (like a firewall).  Sometimes, a US
   team is marching down the field toward a goal (sending data).

   Another technical example of a cooperative router task is to spread
   the BGP load across multiple routers in a router team.  The load of
   BGP instances are dynamically distributed among Team Members, who
   have the same router ID and same set of exterior IP addresses.  The
   external BGP peers are all connected to the exterior IP address.

   A cooperative router team can seamlessly scale up and down without
   service disruptions.  New routers can be added into or removed from
   the cooperative router team in response to the load of the router
   team.

   This describes the vision of the winning team router.  However, there
   are a series of challenges to make a router team cooperative.  Some
   of these problems can be solved by good existing mechanisms.  This is
   similar to a football team's basics of blocking and tackling.

   The team router will need to develop some new mechanisms to provide
   new services in the Internet.  Like a football team, the new
   mechanisms create ways to avoid security attacks.


4.  Problem Statement

4.1.  Router Team Membership

   When a new router joins a router team, the necessary procedures are
   automatic bi-directional team discovery, negotiation, and
   authentication.  After becoming a member of the router team, its
   resources are added into the router team global resources.  If a
   router leaves the router team, the router team must be able to detect
   its departure and remove its resources from the global resources.

   A router may make available only some of its resources into the
   router team.

   There are many routing protocols such as OSPF, ISIS, have router
   membership mechanisms, but none of them support router team.

4.2.  Router Capability Dynamic Exchange

   The router team available resources can be changed dynamically all
   the time.  Especially when a router joins or leaves the router team,
   the router team needs to be aware of the change.  The router
   capability exchange mechanism is needed.  Capability here refers to
   the router's available hardware and software resources.

4.3.  Cooperative Router Group Topology

   There's a lot internal communication among the router members if they
   are collaboratively working for the same tasks.  Each router member
   has its interior addresses for internal communication.  Those
   addresses are concealed from routers outside of the cooperative
   router team.  A mechanism is needed to learn the interior network
   topology from other routers.  This mechanism needs to be extremely
   light weight when compared to existing protocols such OSPF and ISIS.
   It needs to converge extremely fast.

   Meanwhile, a cooperative router team keeps its public information ---
   router ID and exterior addresses.  The outside routers only know the
   public information.  The packets from outside routers have
   destination to router team exterior addresses.  A new mechanism is
   needed to forward those packets to proper router members.  Section
   4.3.1 gives an example of the scenarios.




Yang & Tsou              Expires January 5, 2012                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           IRCAT Problem Statement               July 2011


   This new mechanism may face the following listed problemsGBPo

   o  The exterior addresses are always configured in the applications
      of the router members.  It is possible that the same exterior IP
      addresses are on multiple member routers.  For example, BGP may
      have multiple instances which are running on multiple routers
      under router team scenario.  Those BGP instances have the same
      router ID and the same exterior address to outside peers.  The
      forwarding mechanism should forward those BGP packets to proper
      router members even though all BGP packets are destined to same
      exterior address.

   o  The forwarding can be changed dynamically.  Because working load
      can be migrated from one to another router member, the packet
      forwarding should be updated in corresponding to the migration.

4.3.1.  An Example of Interior Router Team Network

                 10.1.1.1           10.1.1.2               10.1.1.3
               +-----------+       +-----------+       +-----------+
               |  router A |       | router B  |       | router C  |
               |  (BGP 1)  | ----- |  (BGP 2)  | ----- |  (OSPF)   |
               (|100.1.1.1)|       |(100.1.1.1)|       |(100.1.1.1 |
               +-----------+       +-----------+       +-----------+
               |   LC      |       |   LC      |       |    LC     |
               +-----------+       +-----------+       +-----------+
                 |  |  |            |  |  |              |  |  |

                  Figure 4: Interior Router Team Network

   Router member A, B and C are constructed as a cooperative router team
   in figure 2.  Their interior IP addresses are 10.1.1.1, 10.1.1.2,
   10.1.1.3 respectively.  The router team has exterior address
   100.1.1.1.

   Two BGP instances are running on the router member A and B. An OSPF
   instance is running on router member C. Half of the BGP peers are
   handled by router member A and the other half are handled by router
   member B. All BGP peers connect to the exterior address 100.1.1.1,
   and the load are shared by the cooperative router.

   The packet forwarding needs to address the following scenarios:

   o  BGP packets with a destination address of 100.1.1.1 handled by the
      BGP instance on router member A is forwarded to router A;

   o  BGP packets with a destination address of 100.1.1.1 and handled by
      BGP instance on router member B is forwarded to router member B.

Internet-Draft           IRCAT Problem Statement               July 2011


   o  OSPF packets are forwarded to router member C.

   These cooperative functions are dynamic so that the load can be
   shifted during different processing periods for each protocol.

4.4.  Cooperative Router Team Task Collaboration

   The working load collaboration in router team provides the following
   capabilities:

   o  Multiple router members can be working with same tasks
      collaboratively; and

   o  router members who enter resources panic mode (i.e. running out of
      resources) can migrate a part or all of their working load to
      other router member(s).

   It should be possible for the cooperative router team load migration
   to be automatic and dynamic based on pre-determined policies.

4.4.1.  Local Resources Monitoring

   It is too late if a router member completely runs out of resources
   and then realizes it can move some working load out.  The router
   member should monitor its local resource status.  If it reaches alarm
   zone, the router member starts the working load migration.

4.4.2.  Migration Source Selection

   TBD.

4.4.3.  Migration Targets Selection

   If a router member needs to offload its work load, it must know where
   the targets are.  Why is this?  Like a football team, the cooperative
   router must know where the members are so they can pass the ball.
   There are two ways this off load can occur.

   Way 1: The router member always collects the other member's
   capability before the work load migration.  When the work load
   migration starts, the router member already has enough knowledge to
   know the migration targets.

   Way 2: The router member does not have the other router member's
   capability.  It asks for help by broadcast messages and then waits
   for the other router members' response.  The router member knows the
   migration targets based on responded information.

   How do you select where the load goes to?  Internally the selection
   mechanism of the router team selects the member to offload its
   traffic to.  This is like the quarterback selecting the person to
   pass the football to.

   A negotiation mechanism is also needed after migration targets are
   decided.  Somehow, the target must know they are being passed the
   task.

4.5.  Unified Router Team Control Plane

   The reasons for unified router team control plane are:

   o  The members of the cooperative router team each have one or more
      processors that can be leveraged into a virtual control plane;

   o  The virtual control plane can distribute the computation load as
      network load changes;

   o  The members can join or leave the virtual control plane
      dynamically and seamlessly to add/delete resources as needed (for
      load sharing or resiliency)

   In this way, the unified router team control plane has a global
   control plane resource pool that controls the forwarding plane.

   Just like a football team member, when you join a team your body
   becomes one of the football team's resources.  Your ability to pass
   things forward becomes the team's ability.

4.6.  Router Control Plane and Forwarding Plane Separation

   This problem is related to the router team control plane
   virtualization.  It is natural in a single router that a control
   plane only manages its local forwarding hardware.  But in cooperative
   router team, it is possible that a control plane on another router
   member can manage the local forwarding hardware on behalf of the
   local router control plane.  The forwarding plane can no longer find
   out its specific control plane, but face the unified router team
   control plane.

   team approach is practical and effective approach to meet the
   extremely high scaling requirements.

   We denote this approach as Inter Router Cooperative and Teaming
   (IRCAT).  IRCAT forms a new architecture paradigm running on
   heterogeneous routers to let them construct as a cooperative router
   team.

   The draft is to start the discussion of such an architecture and
   mechanisms which might be possible to achieve it.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations on this architecture paradigm are placed
   here for discussion.  This is an architecture, and IETF deals in
   mechanism, interfaces and protocols.

   In the IRCAT model, security can go from "none" to the highest level
   of security at every task.

   For the "no security" level, all members of the cooperative router
   team are fully trusted.  A malicious router member can easily bring
   down the whole router team.  The cooperative may face possible DOS
   attacks from outside network.

   For the full secure level, all peers, tasks, and capabilities are
   individually secured.
