1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the behavior to be followed by the PCP client
   [RFC6887] to contact its PCP server(s) [RFC6887] when receiving one
   or several PCP server names (e.g., using DHCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp]).
   This document is not specific to DHCP; any other mechanism can be
   used to configure PCP server names.

   Multiple names may be configured to a PCP client in some deployment
   contexts such as multi-homing (see Appendix A).  It is out of scope
   of this document to enumerate all deployment scenarios which require
   multiple names to be configured.

Internet-Draft            PCP Server Selection                  May 2013


   This document assumes appropriate name resolution means (e.g.,
   Section 6.1.1 of [RFC1123]) are available on the host client.

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  PCP server denotes a functional element which receives and
      processes PCP requests from a PCP client.  A PCP server can be co-
      located with or be separated from the function (e.g., Network
      Address Translation (NAT), firewall) it controls.  Refer to
      [RFC6887].
   o  PCP client denotes a PCP software instance responsible for issuing
      PCP requests to a PCP server.  Refer to [RFC6887].
   o  Name is a string that can be passed to getaddrinfo (Section 6.1 of
      [RFC3493]), such as a DNS name, address literals, etc.  A name may
      be a fully qualified domain name (e.g., "myservice.example.com."),
      IPv4 address in dotted-decimal form (e.g., 192.0.2.33) or textual
      representation of an IPv6 address (e.g., 2001:db8::1).

3.  Name Resolution

   Each configured name is passed to the name resolution library (e.g.,
   Section 6.1.1 of [RFC1123] or [RFC6055]) to retrieve the
   corresponding IP address(es) (IPv4 or IPv6).  Then, the PCP client
   follows the procedure specified in Section 4 to contact its PCP
   server(s).

   A host may have multiple network interfaces (e.g, 3G, IEEE 802.11,
   etc.); each configured differently.  Each PCP server learned MUST be
   associated with the interface via which it was learned.

4.  IP Address Selection

   This section specifies the behavior to be followed by the PCP client
   to contact its PCP server(s) when receiving one or several PCP server
   names:

   1.  If only one PCP server name is configured: if a list of IP
       addresses is returned as a result of resolving the PCP server
       name, the PCP client follows the procedure specified in
       Section 4.1.

Internet-Draft            PCP Server Selection                  May 2013


   2.  If several PCP server names are configured: each name is treated
       as a separate PCP server.  Moreover, each name may be resolved
       into one IP address or a list of IP addresses.  The PCP client
       contacts in parallel the first IP address of each name and
       follows the procedure specified in Section 4.1 for the list of IP
       addresses returned for each name.  Section 5 provides some
       examples to illustrate this procedure.

   This procedure does not require any knowledge of the capabilities of
   the PCP-controlled device(s).  Instead, the PCP client assumes each
   configured name refer to a separate PCP server.

   This procedure may result in a PCP client instantiating multiple
   mappings maintained by distinct PCP servers.  The decision to use all
   these mappings or delete some of them is deployment-specific.  Only
   the PCP client can decide whether all the mappings are needed or only
   a subset of them.

4.1.  Serial Queries

   The PCP client initializes its Maximum Retransmission Count (MRC) to
   4.

   The PCP client sends its PCP message to the PCP server following the
   retransmission procedure specified in Section 8.1.1 of [RFC6887].  If
   no response is received after MRC attempts, the PCP client tries with
   the next IP address in its list of PCP server addresses.  If it has
   exhausted its list, the procedure is repeated every fifteen minutes
   until the PCP request is successfully answered.  If, when sending PCP
   requests the PCP client receives an ICMP error (e.g., port
   unreachable, network unreachable) it SHOULD immediately try the next
   IP address in the list.  Once the PCP client has successfully
   received a response from a PCP server address on that interface, it
   sends subsequent PCP requests to that same server address until that
   PCP server becomes non-responsive, which causes the PCP client to
   attempt to re-iterate the procedure starting with the first PCP
   server address on its list.

5.  Examples

   The following sub-sections provide three examples to illustrate the
   procedure.

   For all these examples, let's suppose pcpserver-x, pcpserver-y and
   pcpserver-z are configured as PCP server names.

5.1.  Example 1

Internet-Draft            PCP Server Selection                  May 2013


   Let's also suppose:

   * IPx1 and IPx2 are returned for pcpserver-x; IPx1 is not reachable.
   * IPy1 and IPy2 are returned for pcpserver-y; IPy1 is reachable
   * IPz1 and IPz2 are returned for pcpserver-z; IPz1 is reachable


   The procedure to contact the PCP servers is as follows:

   * Send PCP requests to all servers: IPx1, IPy1 and IPz1
   * Responses are received from IPy1 and IPz1 but not from IPx1
     - The request is re-sent to IPx1
     - If no response is received after four attempts, the request
       is sent to IPx2


5.2.  Example 2

   Now, if the following conditions are made:

   * IPx1 and IPx2 are returned for pcpserver-x; IPx1 is not reachable.
   * IPy1 and IPy2 are returned for pcpserver-y; IPy1 is reachable
   * IPz1 and IPz2 are returned for pcpserver-z; IPz1 is not reachable


   The procedure to contact the PCP servers lead to the following:

   * Send PCP requests to all servers: IPx1, IPy1 and IPz1
   * A response is received from IPy1 but not from IPx1 and IPz1
     - the requests are re-sent to IPx1 and IPz1
     - If no response is received after four attempts, the request
       is then sent to IPx2 and IPz2


5.3.  Example 3

   Let's suppose now that:

   * IPx1 and IPx2 are returned for pcpserver-x; IPx1 is not reachable.
   * IPy1 and IPy2 are returned for pcpserver-y; IPy1 is not reachable
   * IPz1 and IPz2 are returned for pcpserver-z; IPz1 is not reachable


   The procedure to contact the PCP servers is as follows:

   * Send PCP requests to all servers: IPx1, IPy1 and IPz1
   * No answer is received for all requests
     - the requests are re-sent to IPx1, IPy1 and IPz1

       is then sent to IPx2, IPy2 and IPz2


6.  Security Considerations

   PCP-related security considerations are discussed in [RFC6887].

   This document does not specify how PCP server names are provisioned
   to the PCP client.  It is the responsibility of PCP server
   provisioning document(s) to elaborate on the security considerations
   to discover a legitimate PCP server.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any action from IANA.

Appendix A.  Multi-homing

   The main problem of a PCP multi-homing situation can be succinctly
   described as 'one PCP client, multiple PCP servers'.  As described in
   Section 4, if a PCP client discovers multiple PCP server names, it
   should send requests to all of them in parallel with the following
   assumptions:

   o  There is no requirement that multiple PCP servers have the same
      capabilities.

   o  PCP requests to different servers are independent, the result of a
      PCP request to one server does not influence another.

   o  If PCP servers provide NAT, it is out of scope how the client
      manages ports across PCP servers.  For example, whether PCP client
      requires all external ports to be the same or whether there are
      ports available at all.

   The following sub-sections describe multi-homing examples to
   illustrate PCP client behavior.

A.1.  IPv6 Multi-homing

   In this example of an IPv6 multi-homed network, two or more routers
   co-located with firewalls are present on a single link shared with
   the host(s).  Each router is in turn connected to a different service
   provider network and the host in this environment would be offered
   multiple prefixes and advertised multiple DNS/NTP servers.  Consider
   a scenario in which firewalls within an IPv6 multi-homing environment
   also implement a PCP server.  PCP client learns of the available PCP
   servers using DHCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp] or any other PCP server
   discovery technique defined in future specifications.  The PCP client
   will send PCP requests in parallel to each of the PCP servers.

A.2.  IPv4 Multi-homing

   In this example an IPv4 multi-homed network described in 'NAT- or
   RFC2260-based multi-homing' (Section 3.3 of[RFC4116]), the gateway
   router is connected to different service provider networks.  This
   method uses PA addresses assigned by each transit provider to which
   the site is connected.  The site uses NAT to translate the various
   provider addresses into a single set of private-use addresses within
   the site.  In such a case, two PCP servers have to be present to
   control NAT to each of the transit providers.  PCP client learns of
   the available PCP servers using DHCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp] or any other
   PCP server discovery technique defined in future specifications.  The
   PCP client will send PCP requests in parallel to each of the PCP
   servers.

A.3.  Multiple interfaces and Servers

   In case for multi-homing when an end host such as a mobile terminal
   has multiple interfaces concurrently active (e.g., IEEE 802.11 and
   3G), a PCP client would discover different PCP servers over different
   interfaces.  Although multiple interfaces are available, an
   application might choose to use just one based on, for example, cost
   and bandwidth requirements, and therefore would need to send PCP
   requests to just one PCP server.
