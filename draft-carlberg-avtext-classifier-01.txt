    A Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) Classifier Header Extension
                  draft-carlberg-avtext-classifier-01


Abstract

   This document defines a new RTP header extension. The purpose of the
   extension is to provide additional information that further
   distinguishes the RTP datagram (and its payload) from other datagrams
   containing the same type of payload.  The information may be used to
   assist functions performed by application layer gateways (such as
   Session Border Controller or MCUs) and/or by routers/switches through
   deep packet inspection. Examples of these functions include intelligent
   dropping of packets or (re)setting the IP header diff-serv code points
   at ingress/egress boundaries of a diff-serv domain.

1. Introduction

   This document defines a new RTP Header extension.  The purpose of the
   extension it to provide additional information that distinguishes the
   RTP datagram (and its payload) from other datagrams containing the same
   type of payload.  This distinction can be viewed as a generalized
   abbreviation of the significance of the payload.

   It is important to note that this document uses the term classification,
   NOT priority, in distinguishing payloads.  This is because the word
   priority tends to convey a definitive importance of the packet, as well
   as an expected Quality of Service (QoS).  In addition, the concept of
   priority may be different on per-application or per-user community
   basis.  Hence, local policy is required to determine the relationship of
   various classifications.  This policy may be associated with the
   administrative policy defined for a domain.  The form, support of, and
   dissemination of local policy is outside the scope of this document.

   Another advantage in appending a classifier extension to the RTP header
   is that it provides a means by which a forwarding node acquires
   information from the source without the need to breach confidentiality
   (through the use of Secure RTP) or support of the codec used to produce
   the RTP payload.

1.2  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [rfc2119].

2. Related Work

   There have been several efforts that have added classification, in the
   more narrow scope of priority to other applications.  These efforts
   include: (1) a Resource Priority Header in the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) [rfc4412] and (2) a priority extension for the Simple
   Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [rfc6710], and (3) a priority policy
   element for the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) [rfc6401].

   In each of these examples, the priority classification was accomplished
   by dividing the solution space into two parts.  The first identified a
   namespace associated with the set of priorities.  The second part

Internet Drafts    Classifier Extension Header for RTP      Oct 21, 2013


   identified the specific priority.  Initial example values would be
   defined in the respective RFC, while future values would be placed in a
   registry maintained by IANA.  The advantage in using this two-part
   solution was that various "communities of interest" had the freedom to
   define the form of the classification (in their case, priority) and the
   number of classifications.  In addition, the registry provided a common
   place where various vendors and user groups could access and agree on a
   single set of values that assisted in interoperability.

3. Classifier Header Extension

   The classifier header extension for RTP is divided into two parts: a
   Namespace entry and a Value entry.  This information is carried in an
   RTP header extension element as by "A General Mechanism for RTP Header
   Extensions" [rfc5285].

   The payload of the classifier header extension element can be encoded
   using either the one-byte or two-byte header defined in [rfc5285] and
   shown below in Figure 1 and 2 below.

   Author's notes: There have been recent discussions in the Transport
   Services working group (TSVWG) on the relative importance of different
   types of payloads.  There has also been recent work concerning the
   mapping of diff-serv code points related to RTP payloads.  In both of
   these cases, the focus has been with the characteristics of specific
   types of applications.

   On the other hand, and as discussed above in section 2, previous related
   work has gravitated to supporting classifications (specifically,
   priorities) based on a user community.  One can easily observe that
   these are two different and possibly divergent motivations in adding

   classification information to an RTP payload.  A question to the
   community is should both interests be supported by a new RTP classifier
   header? (the author's position is yes)

   Examples exist in the case of Namespaces correlating to a user
   community.  This section should, at a minimum, present an example
   Namespace that correlates to either a specific application or a set of
   applications.  Another question to the community is whether the latter
   can be achieved since it would reduce the number of Namespaces that
   would need to be supported by implementors.  The author's position is
   that this could be achieved by having a Namespace and set of values that
   correspond to the existing set of defined differentiated services code
   points.  As such, we recommend a Namespace assigned to a per-hop
   behaviour (e.g., the AFxx set of code points)

   Finally, we anticipate the possibility that two sets of users groups may
   choose to inject their own classifier information: one that corresponds
   to hop-by-hop forwarding, and the other at the destination end-point.
   However, we should encourage a minimalistic approach and discourage more
   than two (namespace, value) entries.
