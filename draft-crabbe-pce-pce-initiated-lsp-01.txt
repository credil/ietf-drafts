  PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP Setup in a Stateful PCE Model
                 draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp-01

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.

   The extensions described in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] provide
   stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP) via PCEP, for a model where
   the PCC delegates control over one or more locally configured LSPs to
   the PCE.  This document describes the creation and deletion of PCE-
   initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model.

Requirements Language

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE - PCE-initiated LSP          April 2013


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol PCEP.  PCEP
   defines the communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and
   a Path Control Element (PCE), or between PCE and PCE, enabling
   computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP) characteristics.

   Stateful pce [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of TE LSPs between and
   across PCEP sessions in compliance with [RFC4657].  It includes
   mechanisms to effect LSP state synchronization between PCCs and PCEs,
   delegation of control of LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and
   sequence of path computations within and across PCEP sessions and
   focuses on a model where LSPs are configured on the PCC and control
   over them is delegated to the PCE.

   This document describes the setup and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs
   under the stateful PCE model, without the need for local
   configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic network that is
   centrally controlled and deployed.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCC,
   PCE, PCEP Peer.

   This document uses the following terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]: Stateful PCE, Delegation, Delegation
   Timeout Interval, LSP State Report, LSP Update Request.

   The following terms are defined in this document:

   PCE-initiated LSP:  LSP that is instantiated as a result of a request
      from the PCE.

   LSP cleanup timer:  PCE-defined timer for cleanup of PCE-initiated
      LSPs that are no longer delegated to a PCE.

   The message formats in this document are specified using Routing
   Backus-Naur Format (RBNF) encoding as specified in [RFC5511].

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE - PCE-initiated LSP          April 2013


3.1.  Motivation

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] provides stateful control over LSPs that
   are locally configured on the PCC.  This model relies on the LER
   taking an active role in delegating locally configured LSPs to the
   PCE, and is well suited in environments where the LSP placement is
   fairly static.  However, in environments where the LSP placement
   needs to change in response to application demands, it is useful to
   support dynamic creation and tear down of LSPs.  The ability for a
   PCE to trigger the creation of LSPs on demand can make possible agile
   software-driven network operation, and can be seamlessly integrated
   into a controller-based network architecture, where intelligence in
   the controller can determine when and where to set up paths.

   A possible use case is one of a software-driven network, where
   applications request network resources and paths from the network
   infrastructure.  For example, an application can request a path with
   certain constraints between two LSRs by contacting the PCE.  The PCE
   can compute a path satisfying the constraints, and instruct the head
   end LSR to create and signal it.  When the path is no longer required
   by the application, the PCE can request its teardown.

   Another use case is that of demand engineering, where a PCE with
   visibility into both the network state and the demand matrix can
   anticipate and optimize how traffic is distributed across the
   infrastructure.  Such optimizations may require creating new paths
   across the infrastructure.

3.2.  Operation overview

   A PCC indicates its ability to support PCE provisioned dynamic LSPs
   during the PCEP Initialization Phase via a new flag in the STATEFUL-
   PCE-CAPABILITY TLV (see details in Section 4.1).

   The decision when to create a PCE-initiated LSP is out of the scope
   of this document.  To instantiate an LSP, the PCE sends a new
   message, the LSP Create Request (PCCreate) message to the PCC.  The
   LSP Create Request MUST include the END-POINTS and LSPA objects, and
   the LSPA object MUST include the SYMBOLIC-PATH-NAME TLV.  The PCC
   creates the LSP using the attributes communicated by the PCE, and
   local values for the unspecified parameters.  It assigns a unique
   LSP-ID for the LSP and automatically delegates the LSP to the PCE.
   It then generates an LSP State Report (PCRpt) for the LSP, carrying
   the LSP-ID and the delegation bit.  The PCE may update the attributes
   of the LSP via subsequent PCUpd messages.

   Subsequent LSP State Report and LSP Update Request for the LSP will
   carry the PCC-assigned LSP-ID, which uniquely identifies the LSP.

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE - PCE-initiated LSP          April 2013


   The LSPA Object included in these messages MUST carry the SYMBOLIC-
   PATH-NAME TLV which will be used to correlate between the PCC-
   assigned LSP-ID and the LSP.  See details in Section 5.

   Removal of PCE-initiated LSPs is done by the PCE by setting the R
   flag in the LSP Object in the PCUpd message.  Upon receiving the
   PCUpd message with the R Flag set, the PCC deletes the LSP.  See
   details in Section 5.

   Once instantiated, a PCRpt is generated for the LSP, with the
   delegation bit set.  After this, the delegation procedures for PCE-
   initiated LSPs are the same as for PCC initiated LSPs.  Upon session
   failure, PCE-initiated LSPs are not immediately removed, in order to
   avoid LSP flap and service interruption.  However, to allow for
   network cleanup without manual intervention, such "orphan" PCE-
   initiated LSPs must be either adopted by a different PCE or cleaned
   up within a time interval.  This time is negotiated between PCE and
   PCC at session initialization time.  See details in Section 6.


4.  Support of PCE-initiated LSPs

   A PCC indicates its ability to support PCE provisioned dynamic LSPs
   during the PCEP Initialization Phase.  The Open Object in the Open
   message contains the "Stateful PCE Capability" TLV, defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].

   A new flag, the I (LSP-INSTANTIATION-CAPABILITY) flag is introduced
   to indicate support for instantiation of PCE-initiated LSPs.  A PCE
   wishing to initiate LSPs, can do so only for PCCs that advertised
   this capability and a PCC will follow the procedures described in
   this document only on sessions where the PCE advertised the I flag.
   A PCE or PCC that advertise support of LSP initiation MUST also
   advertise a cleanup time for the removal of such LSPs.  The cleanup
   time is advertised via a new TLV in the Open Object, the LSP-CLEANUP
   TLV, discussed in Section 6, and the value is negotiated to the lower
   one advertised on a session.

4.1.  Stateful PCE Capability TLV

   The format of the STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV is shown in the
   following figure:

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-+-+-+-+-+

               Figure 1: STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV format

   The type of the TLV is defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and it
   has a fixed length of 4 octets.

   The value comprises a single field - Flags (32 bits).  The U and S
   bits are defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].

   If set to 1 by a PCC, the I Flag indicates that the PCC allows
   instantiation of an LSP by a PCE.  If set to 1 by a PCE, the I flag
   indicates that the PCE will attempt to instantiate LSPs.  The LSP-
   INSTANTIATION-CAPABILITY flag must be set by both PCC and PCE in
   order to support PCE-initiated LSP instantiation.

   Unassigned bits are considered reserved.  They MUST be set to 0 on
   transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.


5.  PCE-initiated LSP creation

   To create a PCE-initiated LSP, a PCE sends a PCCreate message to a
   PCC, which include a set of objects and TLVs describing the LSP to be
   instantiated.  The message format, the objects and TLVs are discussed
   separately below.

5.1.  The LSP Create Message

   A Path Computation LSP Create message (also referred to as PCCreate
   message) is a PCEP message sent by a PCE to a PCC to trigger an LSP
   instantiation.  The Message-Type field of the PCEP common header for
   the PCCreate message is set to [TBD].

   The PCCreate message MUST include the END-POINTS and the LSPA
   objects.  In the LSPA object, it MUST include the SYMBOLIC-PATH-NAME
   TLV for the LSP.  The PCCreate message MAY include other attributes
   for the LSP.  If specified, the PCC MUST use them for the LSP
   instantiation, otherwise it MUST use its locally configured values.
   The error messages will be specified in a future version of this
   document.

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE - PCE-initiated LSP          April 2013


   The format of a PCCreate message is as follows:


   <PCCreate Message> ::= <Common Header>
                       <lsp-instantiation-list>
Where:

   <lsp-instantiation-list> ::= <lsp-instantiation-request>[<lsp-instantiation-list>]

   <lsp-instantiation-request> ::= <END-POINTS>
                                   <LSPA>
                                   [<ERO>]
                                   [<BANDWIDTH>]
                                   [<metric-list>]


Where:

   <metric-list>::=<METRIC>[<metric-list>]


   The END-POINTS Object contains the source and destination addresses
   for provisioning the PCE-initiated LSP.  If the END-POINTS Object is
   missing, the PCC MUST send a PCErr message with Error-type=6
   (Mandatory Object missing) and Error-value=3 (END-POINTS Object
   missing).

   The LSPA Object MUST include the SYMBOLIC-PATH-NAME TLV, which will
   be used to correlate between the PCC-assigned LSP-ID and the LSP.  If
   the TLV is missing, the PCC MUST send a PCErr message with Error-
   type=6(Mandatory object missing) and Error-value=14 (SYMBOLIC-PATH-
   NAME TLV missing).  The symbolic name used for provisioning PCE-
   initiated LSPs must not have conflict with the LSP name of any
   existing LSP in the PCC.  (Existing LSPs may be either statically
   configured, or initiated by another PCE).  If there is conflict with
   the LSP name, the PCC MUST send a PCErr message with Error-type=23
   (Bad Parameter value) and Error-value=1 (SYMBOLIC-PATH-NAME in use).
   The only exception to this rule is for LSPs for which the LSP-cleanup
   timer is running (see Section 6).

   PCE-initiated removal of a PCE-initiated LSP is done by setting the R
   (remove) flag in the LSP Object in the PCUpd request from the PCE.
   The definition of the R bit is updated as follows:

   R (Remove - 1 bit): On PCRpt messages the R Flag indicates that the
   LSP has been removed from the PCC.  Upon receiving a PCRpt message
   with the R Flag set to 1, the PCE SHOULD remove all state related to
   the LSP from its database.  In PCUpd messages the R flag indicates

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE - PCE-initiated LSP          April 2013


   that the PCE wishes to disable the LSP.  Upon receiving the PCUpd
   message with the R Flag set for a PCE-initiated LSP, the PCC tears
   down the LSP and removes its state.

   A PCC SHOULD be able to place a limit on either the number of LSPs or
   the percentage of resources that are allocated to honor PCE-initiated
   LSP requests.  As soon as that limit is reached, the PCC MUST send a
   PCErr message of type 19 (Invalid Operation) and value TBD "PCE-
   initiated limit reached" and is free to drop any incoming PCCreate
   messages without additional processing.

   A PCC SHOULD relay to the PCE errors it encounters in the setup of
   PCE-initiated LSP.  The error codes and error processing will be
   detailed in a future version of this document.


6.  LSP delegation and cleanup

6.1.  LSP delegation procedures

   PCE-initiated LSPs are automatically delegated by the PCC to the PCE
   upon instantiation.  The PCC MUST delegate the LSP to the PCE by
   setting the delegation bit to 1 in the PCRpt that includes the
   assigned LSP-Id.  All subsequent messages from the PCC must have the
   delegation bit set to 1.  The PCC cannot revoke the delegation for
   PCE-initiated LSPs for an active PCEP session.  Sending a PCRpt
   message with the delegation bit set to 0 results in a PCErr message
   of type 19 (Invalid Operation) and value TBD "Delegation for PCE-
   initiated LSP cannot be revoked".

   A PCE MAY return a delegation to the PCC, to allow for LSP transfer
   between PCEs.  Doing so MUST trigger the LSP cleanup timer described
   in Section 6.2.

   Control over PCE-initiated LSPs reverts to the PCC at the expiration
   of the delegation timeout.  To obtain control of a PCE-initiated LSP,
   a PCE (either the original or one of its backups) sends a PCCreate
   message specifying the endpoints and symbolic name (the same process
   used when initiating an LSP from the PCE).  See more in the next
   section.

6.2.  LSP cleanup procedures

   The LSP cleanup timer ensures that a PCE crash does not result in
   automatic and immediate disruption for the services using PCE-
   initiated LSPs.  PCE-initiated LSPs are not be removed immediately
   upon PCE failure.  Instead, they are cleaned up on the expiration of
   this timer.  This allows for network cleanup without manual



Crabbe, et al.          Expires October 12, 2013                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE - PCE-initiated LSP          April 2013


   intervention.  The LSP cleanup timer is advertised in the session
   open message via a mandatory TLV for sessions where PCE-initiated
   LSPs are supported.  The timer is started upon PCEP session failure
   and is stopped when the LSP is delegated to a PCE.  Both PCE and PCC
   advertise a value for this timer, and the timer value is negotiated
   to the lower value of the two.

6.2.1.  LSP-CLEANUP TLV

   The LSP-CLEANUP TLV is advertised in the Open Object and is mandatory
   when the I flag is set in the STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV.  The LSP-
   CLEANUP TLV contains the time in seconds that the PCC has to wait
   before cleaning up any PCE-initiated LSPs belonging to a particular
   PCEP session when a PCEP session terminates.  Both PCE and PCC
   advertise a value for the cleanup time, and the cleanup timer is set
   to the lower of the two.  The timer is triggered on PCEP session
   failure and reset when the LSP is delegated to a PCE.

   Failure to include the mandatory LSP-CLEANUP TLV in the Open Object
   when the I flag is set MUST trigger PCErr of type 6 (Mandatory Object
   missing) and value 13 (LSP-CLEANUP TLV missing).

   The format of the LSP-CLEANUP TLV is shown in the following figure:

           0                   1                   2                   3
           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
           |               Type=TBD         |            Length=4          |
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
           |          LSP cleanup timeout value                            |
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-+-+-+-+-+

                     Figure 2: LSP-CLEANUP TLV format

   The type of the TLV is TBD and it has a fixed length of 4 octets.

   The value comprises a single field, the LSP cleanup timeout value.

   The time in seconds to wait before cleaning up PCE-initiated LSPs.
   Zero means immediate removal.  The value OXFFFFFFFF is reserved.

   A PCE may take control of the dynamic LSPs for which the LSP cleanup
   timer is running by sending an PCCreate request for the LSP.  In this
   case, the "Bad Symbolic Path Name" error MUST NOT be generated, the
   LSP MUST be delegated and the cleanup timer MUST be stopped.

       19       Invalid operation
                 Error-value=3:  PCE-initiated LSP limit reached
                 Error-value=4:  Delegation for PCE-initiated LSP cannot
                                 be revoked
       23       Bad parameter value
                 Error-value=1:  SYMBOLIC-PATH-NAME in use

7.3.  PCEP TLV Type Indicators

       Value     Meaning                     Reference
         26       LSP cleanup                This document


8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   apply to the extensions described in this document.  Additional
   considerations related to a malicious PCE are introduced.

8.1.  Malicious PCE

   The LSP instantiation mechanism described in this document allows a
   PCE to generate state on the PCC and throughout the network.  As a
   result, it introduces a new attack vector: an attacker may flood the
   PCC with LSP instantiation requests and consume network and LSR
   resources, either by spoofing messages or by compromising the PCE
   itself.

   A PCC can protect itself from such an attack by imposing a limit on
   either the number of LSPs or the percentage of resources that are
   allocated to honor PCE-initiated LSP requests.  As soon as that limit
   is reached, the PCC MUST send a PCErr message of type 19 (Invalid
   Operation) and value 3 "PCE-initiated LSP limit reached" and is free
   to drop any incoming PCCreate messages without additional processing.

   Rapid flaps triggered by the PCE can also be an attack vector.  This
   will be discussed in a future version of this document.
