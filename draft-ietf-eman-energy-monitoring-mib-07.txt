     1. Introduction 

        This document defines a subset of the Management Information 
        Base (MIB) for use in energy management of devices within or 
        connected to communication networks.  The MIB modules in this 
        document are designed to provide a model for energy management, 
        which includes monitoring for power state and energy consumption 
        of networked elements.  This MIB takes into account the Energy 
        Management Framework [EMAN-FMWK], which in turn, is based on the 
        Requirements for Energy Management [EMAN-REQ]. 
         
        Energy management is applicable to devices in communication 
        networks.  Target devices for this specification include (but 
        are not limited to): routers, switches, Power over Ethernet 
        (PoE) endpoints, protocol gateways for building management 
        systems, intelligent meters, home energy gateways, hosts and 
        servers, sensor proxies, etc. Target devices and the use cases 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>         Expires April 21, 2014          [Page 3] 
         
     Internet-Draft   <Power and Energy Monitoring MIB>  October 2013 
      
        for Energy Management are discussed in Energy Management 
        Applicability Statement [EMAN-AS]. 
         
        Where applicable, device monitoring extends to the individual 
        components of the device and to any attached dependent devices. 
        For example: A device can contain components that are 
        independent from a power-state point of view, such as line 
        cards, processor cards, hard drives.  A device can also have 
        dependent attached devices, such as a switch with PoE endpoints 
        or a power distribution unit with attached endpoints. 
         
        Devices and their sub-components can be modeled using the 
        containment tree of the ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933]. In addition, 
        ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] provides a framework 
        for modeling the relationship between Energy Objects. It is 
        conceivable to have implementations of ENERGY-AWARE-MIB and 
        ENERGY-OBJECT-MIB for modeling the relationships between Energy 
        Objects and also monitoring the Energy consumption. In some 
        situations, it is possible to have implementation of ENERGY-
        OBJECT-MIB along with the requirement of Module Compliance of 
        ENTITY-MIB V4 [RFC6933] with respect to entity4CRCompliance 
        should be supported which requires 3 MIB objects 
        (entPhysicalIndex, entPhysicalName and entPhysicalUUID) MUST be 
        implemented. 
         
         
     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
        current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to 
        section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
         
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
        Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
        (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant to 
        SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, 
        RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
         
         
     3. Use Cases 

        Requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking 
        devices are specified in [EMAN-REQ].  The requirements in [EMAN-
        REQ] cover devices typically found in communications networks, 
        such as switches, routers, and various connected endpoints.  For

        a power monitoring architecture to be useful, it should also 
        apply to facility meters, power distribution units, gateway 
        proxies for commercial building control, home automation 
        devices, and devices that interface with the utility and/or 
        smart grid.  Accordingly, the scope of the MIB modules in this 
        document is broader than that specified in [EMAN-REQ].  Several 
        use cases for Energy Management have been identified in the 
        "Energy Management (EMAN) Applicability Statement" [EMAN-AS]. An 
        illustrative example scenario is presented in Section 8.

        This section describes the concepts specified in the Energy 
        Management Framework [EMAN-FMWK] that pertain to power usage, 
        with specific information related to the MIB module specified in 
        this document.  This subsection maps to the section 
        "Architecture High Level Concepts" in the Power Monitoring 
        Architecture [EMAN-FMWK].

     Internet-Draft   <Power and Energy Monitoring MIB>  October 2013 
      
        The Energy Monitoring MIB has 2 independent MIB modules. The 
        first MIB module energyObjectMib is focused on measurement of 
        power and energy. The second MIB module powerCharMIB is focused 
        on Power Attributes measurements.  
         
         
        The energyObjectMib MIB module consists of five tables.   

        The first table is the eoMeterCapabilitiesTable.  It indicates 
        the instrumentation available for each energy object.  Thus, the 
        entries in this table indicate to the EnMS which other tables 
        from the ENERGY-OBJECT-MIB and POWER-ATTRIBUTES-MIB are 
        available for each energy object.  The eoMeterCapabilitiesTable 
        is indexed by entPhysicalIndex. 
         
        The second table is the eoPowerTable.  It returns the power 
        consumption of each energy object, as well as the units, sign, 
        measurement accuracy, and related objects. The eoPowerTable is 
        indexed by entPhysicalIndex. 
         
        The third table is the eoPowerStateTable.  For each energy 
        object, it provides information and statistics about the 
        supported power states.  The eoPowerStateTable is indexed by 
        entPhysicalIndex and eoPowerStateIndex. 
         
        The fourth table is the eoEnergyParametersTable.  The entries in 
        this table configure the parameters of energy and demand 
        measurement collection.  This table is indexed by 
        eoEnergyParametersIndex.  
         
        The fifth table is the eoEnergyTable.  The entries in this table 
        provide the log the energy and demand information.  This table 
        is indexed by eoEnergyParametersIndex.

     5.1. Energy Object Information 

        Refer to the "Energy Object Information" section in [EMAN-FMWK] 
        for background information.  An energy aware device is 
        considered as an instance of a Energy Object as defined in the 
        [EMAN-FMWK]. 
         
        The Energy Object identity information is specified in the MIB 
        ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] primary table, i.e. the 
        eoTable. In this table, the context of the Energy Object such as 
        Domain, RoleDescription, Importance are specified. In addition, 
        the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module returns the relationship between 
        Objects. There are several possible relationships between Parent 
        and Child as defined in [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] such as MeteredBy, 
        PoweredBy, and AggregatedBy.

     5.2. Power State 

        Refer to the "Power States" section in [EMAN-FMWK] for 
        background information. 
         
        An Energy Object may have energy conservation modes called Power 
        States.  Between the ON and OFF states of a device, there can be 
        several intermediate energy saving modes.  Those energy saving 
        modes are called as Power States.  
         
        Power States, which represent universal states of power 
        management of an Energy Object, are specified by the 
        eoPowerState MIB object. The actual Power State is specified by 
        the eoPowerOperState MIB object, while the eoPowerAdminState MIB 
        object specifies the Power State requested for the Energy 
        Object. The difference between the values of eoPowerOperState 
        and eoPowerAdminState can be attributed that the Energy Object 
        is busy transitioning from eoPowerAdminState into the 
        eoPowerOperState, at which point it will update the content of 
        eoPowerOperState.  In addition, the possible reason for change 
        in Power State is reported in eoPowerStateEnterReason.  
        Regarding eoPowerStateEnterReason, management stations and 
        Energy Objects should support any format of the owner string 
        dictated by the local policy of the organization.  It is 
        suggested that this name contain at least the reason for the 
        transition change, and one or more of the following: IP address,

        phone number. 
         
        The MIB objects eoPowerOperState, eoPowerAdminState , and 
        eoPowerStateEnterReason are contained in the eoPowerTable MIB 
        table. 
            
        The eoPowerStateTable table enumerates the maximum power usage 
        in watts, for every single supported Power State of each Power 
        State Set supported by the Energy Object. In addition, 
        PowerStateTable provides additional statistics: 
        eoPowerStateEnterCount, the number of times an entity has 
        visited a particular Power State, and eoPowerStateTotalTime, the 
        total time spent in a particular Power State of an Energy 
        Object.

     5.2.1. Power State Set 

        There are several standards and implementations of Power State 
        Sets.  A Energy Object can support one or multiple Power State 
        Set implementation(s) concurrently.  
         
        There are currently three Power State Sets advocated:   
         
          unknown(0) 
          IEEE1621(256) - [IEEE1621] 
          DMTF(512)     - [DMTF] 
          EMAN(1024)    - [EMAN-MONITORING-MIB] 
        
       The respective specific states related to each Power State Set 
        are specified in the following sections. The guidelines for 
        addition of new Power State Sets have been specified in the IANA 
        Considerations Section.  
      
        The Power States within each Power State Set are listed in 
        [EMAN-FMWK]. The Textual Convention IANAPowerStateSet provides 
        the proposed numbering of the Power States within the IEEE1621 
        Power State Set, DMTF Power State Set and the EMAN Power State 
        Set.  
         
     5.3. Energy Object Usage Information 

        Refer to the "Energy Object Usage Measurement" section in [EMAN-
        FMWK] for background information. 
         
        For an Energy Object, power usage is reported using eoPower.  
        The magnitude of measurement is based on the 
        eoPowerUnitMultiplier MIB variable, based on the UnitMultiplier 
        Textual Convention (TC). Power measurement magnitude should 
        conform to the IEC 62053-21 [IEC.62053-21] and IEC 62053-22 
        [IEC.62053-22] definition of unit multiplier for the SI (System 
        International) units of measure.  Measured values are 
        represented in SI units obtained by BaseValue * 10 raised to the 
        power of the scale.   
           
        For example, if current power usage of an Energy Object is 3, it 
        could be 3 W, 3 mW, 3 KW, or 3 MW, depending on the value of 
        eoPowerUnitMultiplier.  Note that other measurements throughout 
        the two MIB modules in this document use the same mechanism, 
        including eoPowerStatePowerUnitMultiplier, 
        eoEnergyUnitMultiplier, and 
        eoACPwrAttributesPowerUnitMultiplier.

     Internet-Draft   <Power and Energy Monitoring MIB>  October 2013 
      
        In addition to knowing the usage and magnitude, it is useful to 
        know how a eoPower measurement was obtained.  An NMS can use 
        this to account for the accuracy and nature of the reading 
        between different implementations.  For this eoPowerOrigin 
        describes whether the measurements were made at the device 
        itself or from a remote source.  The eoPowerMeasurementCaliber 
        describes the method that was used to measure the power and can 
        distinguish actual or estimated values.  There may be devices in 
        the network, which may not be able to measure or report power 
        consumption. For those devices, the object 
        eoPowerMeasurementCaliber shall report that measurement 
        mechanism is "unavailable" and the eoPower measurement shall be 
        "0".  
         
        The nameplate power rating of an Energy Object is specified in 
        eoPowerNameplate MIB object. 
         
         
     5.4. Optional Power Usage Attributes  

        Refer to the "Optional Power Usage  Attributes" section in 
        [EMAN-FMWK] for background information. 
         
        The optional powerAttributesMIB MIB module can be implemented to 
        further describe power usage attributes  measurement.  The 
        powerAttributesMIB MIB module adheres closely to the IEC 61850 
        7-2 standard to describe AC measurements.   
         
        The powerAttributesMIB MIB module contains a primary table, the 
        eoACPwrAttributesTable table, that defines  power attributes 
        measurements for supported  entPhysicalIndex entities, as a 
        sparse extension of the eoPowerTable (with entPhysicalIndex as 
        primary index).  This eoACPwrAttributesTable table contains such 
        information as the configuration (single phase, DEL 3 phases, 
        WYE 3 phases), voltage, frequency, power accuracy, total 
        active/reactive power/apparent power, amperage, and voltage.  
         
        In case of 3-phase power, the eoACPwrAttributesPhaseTable 
        additional table is populated with Power Attributes measurements 
        per phase (so double indexed by the entPhysicalIndex and 
        eoPhaseIndex).  This table, which describes attributes common to 
        both WYE and DEL configurations, contains the average current, 
        active/reactive/apparent power, power factor, and impedance. 
         
        In case of 3-phase power with a DEL configuration, the 
        eoACPwrAttributesDelPhaseTable table describes the phase-to-
        phase  power attributes measurements, i.e., voltage and current.

        In case of 3-phase power with a Wye configuration, the 
        eoACPwrAttributesWyePhaseTable table describes the phase-to-
        neutral power attributes measurements, i.e., voltage and 
        current. 
         
         
     5.5. Optional Energy Measurement 

        Refer to the "Optional Energy and demand Measurement" section in 
        [EMAN-FMWK] for the definition and terminology information. 
         
        It is relevant to measure energy and demand only when there are 
        actual power measurements obtained from measurement hardware. If 
        the eoPowerMeasurementCaliber MIB object has values of 
        unavailable, unknown, estimated, or presumed, then the energy 
        and demand values are not useful. 
         
        Two tables are introduced to characterize energy measurement of 
        an Energy Object: eoEnergyTable and eoEnergyParametersTable.  
        Both energy and demand information can be represented via the 
        eoEnergyTable. Energy information will be an accumulation with 
        no interval. Demand information can be represented.  
        The eoEnergyParametersTable consists of the parameters defining  
        eoEnergyParametersIndex an index of that specifies the setting 
        for collection of energy measurements for an Energy Object, 
        eoEnergyObjectIndex linked to the entPhysicalIndex of the 
        Energy Object, the duration of measurement intervals in seconds, 
        (eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength), the number of successive 
        intervals to be stored in the eoEnergyTable, 
        (eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber), the type of measurement 
        technique (eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode), and a sample rate 
        used to calculate the average (eoEnergyParametersSampleRate).  
        Judicious choice of the sampling rate will ensure accurate 
        measurement of energy while not imposing an excessive polling 
        burden. 
           
        There are three eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode types used for 
        energy measurement collection: period, sliding, and total. The 
        choices of the the three different modes of collection are based 
        on IEC standard 61850-7-4.  Note that multiple  
        eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode types MAY be configured 
        simultaneously. It is important to note that for a given Energy 
        Object, multiple modes (periodic, total, sliding window) of 
        energy measurement collection can be configured with the use of 
        eoEnergyParametersIndex. However, simultaneous measurement in 
        multiple modes for a given Energy Object depends on the Energy 
        Object capability.

        These three eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode types are illustrated 
        by the following three figures, for which: 
         
        - The horizontal axis represents the current time, with the 
        symbol <--- L ---> expressing the 
        eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength, and the 
        eoEnergyCollectionStartTime is represented by S1, S2, S3, S4, 
        ..., Sx where x is the value of 
        eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber. 
         
        - The vertical axis represents the time interval of sampling and 
        the value of eoEnergyConsumed  can be obtained at the end of the 
        sampling period.  The symbol =========== denotes the duration of 
        the sampling period.

        eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber should be (1) one and 
        eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength is ignored. 
         
        The eoEnergyParametersStatus is used to start and stop energy 
        usage logging.  The status of this variable is "active"  when 
        all the objects in eoEnergyParametersTable are appropriate which 
        in turn indicates if eoEnergyTable entries exist or not. 
         
        The eoEnergyTable consists of energy measurements in 
        eoEnergyConsumed, eoEnergyProvided and eoEnergyStored, the units 
        of the measured energy eoEnergyUnitMultiplier, and the maximum 
        observed energy within a window eoEnergyMaxConsumed, 
        eoEnergyMaxProduced.

        Measurements of the total energy consumed by an Energy Object 
        may suffer from interruptions in the continuous measurement of 
        energy consumption.  In order to indicate such interruptions, 
        the object eoEnergyDiscontinuityTime is provided for indicating 
        the time of the last interruption of total energy measurement.  
        eoEnergyDiscontinuityTime shall indicate the sysUpTime [RFC3418] 
        when the device was reset.  
         
        The following example illustrates the eoEnergyTable and 
        eoEnergyParametersTable: 
         
        First, in order to estimate energy, a time interval to sample 
        energy should be specified, i.e. 
        eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength can be set to "900 seconds" or 
        15 minutes and the number of consecutive intervals over which 
        the maximum energy is calculated 
        (eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber) as "10".  The sampling rate 
        internal to the Energy Object for measurement of power usage 
        (eoEnergyParametersSampleRate) can be "1000 milliseconds", as 
        set by the Energy Object as a reasonable value.  Then, the 
        eoEnergyParametersStatus is set to active (value 1) to indicate 
        that the Energy Object should start monitoring the usage per the 
        eoEnergyTable. 
         
        The indices for the eoEnergyTable are  eoEnergyParametersIndex 
        which identifies the index for the setting of energy measurement 
        collection Energy Object, and eoEnergyCollectionStartTime, which 
        denotes the start time of the energy measurement interval based 
        on sysUpTime [RFC3418]. The value of eoEnergyComsumed is the 
        measured energy consumption over the time interval specified 
        (eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength) based on the Energy Object 
        internal sampling rate (eoEnergyParametersSampleRate). While 
        choosing the values for the eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength and 
        eoEnergyParametersSampleRate, it is recommended to take into 
        consideration either the network element resources adequate to 
        process and store the sample values, and the mechanism used to 
        calculate the eoEnergyConsumed.  The units are derived from 
        eoEnergyUnitMultiplier.  For example, eoEnergyConsumed can be 
        "100" with eoEnergyUnitMultiplier  equal to 0, the measured 
        energy consumption of the Energy Object is 100 watt-hours.  The 
        eoEnergyMaxConsumed is the maximum energy observed and that can 
        be "150 watt-hours". 
         
        The eoEnergyTable has a buffer to retain a certain number of 
        intervals, as defined by eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber.   
        If the default value of "10" is kept, then the eoEnergyTable 
        contains 10 energy measurements, including the maximum.

        Here is a brief explanation of how the maximum energy can be 
        calculated.  The first observed energy measurement value is 
        taken to be the initial maximum.  With each subsequent 
        measurement, based on numerical comparison, maximum energy may 
        be updated.  The maximum value is retained as long as the 
        measurements are taking place.  Based on periodic polling of 
        this table, an NMS could compute the maximum over a longer 
        period, i.e. a month, 3 months, or a year. 
      

     5.6. Fault Management 

        [EMAN-REQ] specifies requirements about Power States such as 
        "the current power state" , "the time of the last state change", 
        "the total time spent in each state", "the number of transitions 
        to each state" etc. Some of these requirements are fulfilled 
        explicitly by MIB objects such as eoPowerOperState, 
        eoPowerStateTotalTime and eoPowerStateEnterCount.  Some of the 
        other requirements are met via the SNMP NOTIFICATION mechanism.  
        eoPowerStateChange SNMP notification which is generated when the 
        value(s) of ,eoPowerStateIndex, eoPowerOperState, 
        eoPowerAdminState have changed.  
         
          
     6. Discovery 

        It is foreseen that most Energy Objects will require the 
        implementation of the ENERGY-AWARE MIB [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] as a 
        prerequisite for this MIB module. In such a case, eoPowerTable 
        of the EMAN-MON-MIB is a sparse extension of the eoTable of 
        ENERGY-AWARE-MIB. Every Energy Object MUST implement 
        entPhysicalIndex, entPhysicalUUID  and entPhysicalName from the 
        ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933]. As the primary index for the Energy 
        Object, entPhysicalIndex is used.  

        The NMS must first poll the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-
        MIB], if available, in order to discover all the Energy Objects 
        and the relationships between those (notion of Parent/Child).  
        In the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module tables, the Energy Objects are 
        indexed by the entPhysicalIndex. 

        If an implementation of the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module is available 
        in the local SNMP context, for the same Energy Object, the 
        entPhysicalIndex value (EMAN-AWARE-MIB) shall be used.  The 
        entPhysicalIndex characterizes the  Energy Object in the 
        energyObjectMib and the powerAttributesMIB MIB modules (this 
        document).

        From there, the NMS must poll the eoPowerStateTable (specified 
        in the energyObjectMib module in this document), which 
        enumerates, amongst other things, the maximum power usage.  As 
        the entries in eoPowerStateTable table are indexed by the  
        Energy Object ( entPhysicalIndex), by the Power State Set 
        (eoPowerStateIndex), the maximum power usage is discovered per  
        Energy Object, and the power usage per Power State of the Power 
        State Set.  In other words, polling the eoPowerStateTable allows 
        the discovery of each Power State within every Power State Set 
        supported by the Energy Object.               

        If the Energy Object is an Aggregator or a Proxy, the MIB module 
        would be populated with the Energy Object Parent and Children 
        information, which have their own Energy Object index value 
        (entPhysicalIndex). However, the parent/child relationship must 
        be discovered thanks to the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module.  

        Finally, the NMS can monitor the power attributes thanks to the 
        powerAttributesMIB MIB module, which reuses the entPhysicalIndex 
        to index the Energy Object. 

                                      
     7. Link with the other IETF MIBs 

         
     7.1. Link with the ENTITY-MIB and the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB  

        RFC 4133 [RFC4133] defines the ENTITY-MIB module that lists the 
        physical entities of a networking device (router, switch, etc.) 
        and those physical entities indexed by entPhysicalIndex.  From 
        an energy-management standpoint, the physical entities that 
        consume or produce energy are of interest. 
         
        RFC 3433 [RFC3433] defines the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB module that 
        provides a standardized way of obtaining information (current 
        value of the sensor, operational status of the sensor, and the 
        data units precision) from sensors embedded in networking 
        devices.  Sensors are associated with each index of 
        entPhysicalIndex of the ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133].  While the focus 
        of the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB is on measurement of 
        power usage of networking equipment indexed by the ENTITY-MIB, 
        this MIB proposes a customized power scale for power measurement 
        and different power state states of networking equipment, and 
        functionality to configure the power state states. 
         
        When this MIB module is used to monitor the power usage of 
        devices like routers and switches, the ENTITY-MIB and ENTITY-
        SENSOR MIB SHOULD be implemented.  In such cases, the Energy

        Objects are modeled by the entPhysicalIndex through the 
        entPhysicalEntity MIB object specified in the eoTable in the 
        ENERGY-AWARE-MIB MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-MIB].   

        However, the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB [RFC3433] does not have the ANSI 
        C12.x accuracy classes required for electricity (i.e., 1%, 2%, 
        0.5% accuracy classes). Indeed, entPhySensorPrecision [RFC3433] 
        represents "The number of decimal places of precision in fixed-
        point sensor values returned by the associated entPhySensorValue 
        object".  The ANSI and IEC Standards are used for power 
        measurement and these standards require that we use an accuracy 
        class, not the scientific-number precision model specified in 
        RFC3433.  The eoPowerAccuracy MIB object models this accuracy.  
        Note that eoPowerUnitMultipler represents the scale factor per 
        IEC 62053-21 [IEC.62053-21] and IEC 62053-22 [IEC.62053-22], 
        which is a more logical representation for power measurements 
        (compared to entPhySensorScale), with the mantissa and the 
        exponent values X * 10 ^ Y. 

        Power measurements specifying the qualifier 'UNITS' for each 
        measured value in watts are used in the LLDP-EXT-MED-MIB, POE 
        [RFC3621], and UPS [RFC1628] MIBs.  The same 'UNITS' qualifier 
        is used for the power measurement values.    
         
        One cannot assume that the ENTITY-MIB and ENTITY-SENSOR MIB are 
        implemented for all Energy Objects that need to be monitored.  A 
        typical example is a converged building gateway, monitoring 
        several other devices in the building, doing the proxy between 
        SNMP and a protocol like BACNET.  Another example is the home 
        energy controller.  In such cases, the eoPhysicalEntity value 
        contains the zero value, thanks to PhysicalIndexOrZero textual 
        convention. 
         
        The eoPower is similar to entPhySensorValue [RFC3433] and the 
        eoPowerUnitMultipler is similar to entPhySensorScale. 
         
         
     7.2. Link with the ENTITY-STATE MIB  

        For each entity in the ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133], the ENTITY-STATE 
        MIB [RFC4268] specifies the operational states (entStateOper: 
        unknown, enabled, disabled, testing), the alarm (entStateAlarm: 
        unknown, underRepair, critical, major, minor, warning, 
        indeterminate) and the possible values of standby states  
        (entStateStandby: unknown, hotStandby, coldStandby, 
        providingService).

        From a power monitoring point of view, in contrast to the entity 
        operational states of entities, Power States are required, as 
        proposed in the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB module.  Those 
        Power States can be mapped to the different operational states 
        in the ENTITY-STATE MIB, if a formal mapping is required.  For 
        example, the entStateStandby "unknown", "hotStandby", 
        "coldStandby", states could map to the Power State "unknown", 
        "ready", "standby", respectively, while the entStateStandby 
        "providingService" could map to any "low" to "high" Power State. 
         
         
     7.3. Link with the POWER-OVER-ETHERNET MIB 

        Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] provides an energy monitoring 
        and configuration framework for power over Ethernet devices.  
        The RFC introduces a concept of a port group on a switch to 
        define power monitoring and management policy and does not use 
        the entPhysicalIndex as the index.  Indeed, the 
        pethMainPseConsumptionPower is indexed by the 
        pethMainPseGroupIndex, which has no mapping with the 
        entPhysicalIndex.  
         
        One cannot assume that the Power-over-Ethernet MIB is 
        implemented for all Energy Objects that need to be monitored.   
        A typical example is a converged building gateway, monitoring 
        several other devices in the building, doing the proxy between 
        SNMP and a protocol like BACNET.  Another example is the home 
        energy controller.  In such cases, the eoethPortIndex and 
        eoethPortGrpIndex values contain the zero value, thanks to new 
        PethPsePortIndexOrZero and textual PethPsePortGroupIndexOrZero 
        conventions. 
         
        However, if the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported, 
        the Energy Object eoethPortIndex and eoethPortGrpIndex contain 
        the pethPsePortIndex and pethPsePortGroupIndex, respectively. 
         
        As a consequence, the entPhysicalIndex MIB object has been kept 
        as the unique Energy Object index. 
         
        Note that, even though the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] was 
        created after the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB [RFC3433], it does not reuse 
        the precision notion from the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB, i.e. the 
        entPhySensorPrecision MIB object.

     7.4. Link with the UPS MIB 

        To protect against unexpected power disruption, data centers and 
        buildings make use of Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS).  To 
        protect critical assets, a UPS can be restricted to a particular 
        subset or domain of the network.  UPS usage typically lasts only 
        for a finite period of time, until normal power supply is 
        restored.  Planning is required to decide on the capacity of the 
        UPS based on output power and duration of probable power outage.  
        To properly provision UPS power in a data center or building, it 
        is important to first understand the total demand required to 
        support all the entities in the site.  This demand can be 
        assessed and monitored via the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB.  

        UPS MIB [RFC1628] provides information on the state of the UPS 
        network.  Implementation of the UPS MIB is useful at the 
        aggregate level of a data center or a building.  The MIB module 
        contains several groups of variables: 

        - upsIdent: Identifies the UPS entity (name, model, etc.).  

        - upsBattery group: Indicates the battery state 
        (upsbatteryStatus, upsEstimatedMinutesRemaining, etc.) 

        - upsInput group: Characterizes the input load to the UPS 
        (number of input lines, voltage, current, etc.). 

        - upsOutput: Characterizes the output from the UPS (number of 
        output lines, voltage, current, etc.) 

        - upsAlarms: Indicates the various alarm events.   

        The measurement of power in the UPS MIB is in Volts, Amperes and 
        Watts.  The units of power measurement are RMS volts and RMS 
        Amperes. They are not based on the EntitySensorDataScale and 
        EntitySensorDataPrecision of ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB. 

        Both the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB and the UPS MIB may be 
        implemented on the same UPS SNMP agent, without conflict.  In 
        this case, the UPS device itself is the Energy Object Parent and 
        any of the UPS meters or submeters are the Energy Object 
        Children.

     7.5. Link with the LLDP and LLDP-MED MIBs 

        The LLDP Protocol is a Data Link Layer protocol used by network 
        devices to advertise their identities, capabilities, and 
        interconnections on a LAN network.  
         
        The Media Endpoint Discovery is an enhancement of LLDP, known as 
        LLDP-MED.  The LLDP-MED enhancements specifically address voice 
        applications.  LLDP-MED covers 6 basic areas: capability 
        discovery, LAN speed and duplex discovery, network policy 
        discovery, location identification discovery, inventory 
        discovery, and power discovery.   
         
        Of particular interest to the current MIB module is the power 
        discovery, which allows the endpoint device (such as a PoE 
        phone) to convey power requirements to the switch.  In power 
        discovery, LLDP-MED has four Type Length Values (TLVs): power 
        type, power source, power priority and power value.  
        Respectively, those TLVs provide information related to the type 
        of power (power sourcing entity versus powered device), how the 
        device is powered (from the line, from a backup source, from 
        external power source, etc.), the power priority (how important 
        is it that this device has power?), and how much power the 
        device needs. 
          
        The power priority specified in the LLDP-MED MIB [LLDP-MED-MIB] 
        actually comes from the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621]. If 
        the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported, the exact 
        value from the pethPsePortPowerPriority [RFC3621] is copied over 
        in the lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority [LLDP-MED-MIB]; otherwise 
        the value in lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority is "unknown". From 
        the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB, it is possible to identify 
        the pethPsePortPowerPriority [RFC3621], thanks to the 
        eoethPortIndex and eoethPortGrpIndex. 
         
        The lldpXMedLocXPoEPDPowerSource [LLDP-MED-MIB] is similar to 
        eoPowerOrigin in indicating if the power for an attached device 
        is local or from a remote device. If the LLDP-MED MIB is 
        supported, the following mapping can be applied to the 
        eoPowerOrigin: lldpXMedLocXPoEPDPowerSource fromPSE(2) and 
        local(3) can be mapped to remote(2) and self(1), respectively.

        This section provides an illustrative example scenario for the 
        implementation of the Energy Object, including Energy Object 
        Parent and Energy Object Child relationships.  
         
        Example Scenario of a campus network: Switch with PoE Endpoints 
        with further connected devices.  
         
        The campus network consists of switches that provide LAN 
        connectivity.  The switch with PoE ports is located in wiring 
        closet.  PoE IP phones are connected to the switch.  The IP 
        phones draw power from the PoE ports of the switch.  In 
        addition, a PC is daisy-chained from the IP phone for LAN 
        connectivity.   
         
        The IP phone consumes power from the PoE switch, while the PC 
        consumes power from the wall outlet.  
         
        The switch has implementations of ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933] and  
        ENERGY-AWARE MIB [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] while the PC does not have 
        implementation of the ENTITY-MIB, but has an implementation of 
        ENERGY-AWARE MIB [EMAN-AWARE-MIB].  The switch has the following 
        attributes, entPhysicalIndex "1", and entPhysicalUUID  "UUID 
        1000".  The power usage of the switch is "440 Watts".  The 
        switch does not have an Energy Object Parent. 
         
        The PoE switch port has the following attributes: The switch 
        port has entPhysicalIndex "3", and entPhysicalUUID is "UUID 
        1000:3".  The power metered at the POE switch port is "12 
        watts".  In this example, the POE switch port has the switch as 
        the Energy Object Parent, with its eoParentID of "1000". 
      
        The attributes of the PC are given below.  The PC does not have 
        an entPhysicalIndex, and the entPhysicalUUID is "UUID 1000:57 ".  
        The PC has an Energy Object Parent, i.e. the switch port whose 
        entPhysicalUUID is "UUID 1000:3".  The power usage of the PC is 
        "120 Watts" and is communicated to the switch port.  
         
        This example illustrates the important distinction between the 
        Energy Object Children: The IP phone draws power from the 
        switch, while the PC has LAN connectivity from the phone, but is 
        powered from the wall outlet.  However, the Energy Object Parent 
        sends power control messages to both the Energy Object Children 
        (IP phone and PC) and the Children react to those messages.

     9. Structure of the MIB 

        The primary MIB object in this MIB module is the 
        energyObjectMibObject. The eoPowerTable table of 
        energyObjectMibObject describes the power measurement attributes 
        of an Energy Object entity. The notion of identity of the device 
        in terms of uniquely identification of the Energy Object and its 
        relationship to other entities in the network are addressed in 
        [EMAN-AWARE-MIB].  
         
        Logically, this MIB module is a sparse extension of the 
        [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] module. Thus the following requirements which 
        are applied to [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] are also applicable. As a 
        requirement for this MIB module, [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] should be 
        implemented and as Module Compliance of ENTITY-MIB V4 [RFC6933] 
        with respect to entity4CRCompliance should be supported which 
        requires 3 MIB objects (entPhysicalIndex, entPhysicalName and 
        entPhysicalUUID ) MUST be implemented.  
          
        eoMeterCapabilitiesTable is useful to enable applications to 
        determine the capabilities supported by the local management 
        agent. This table indicates the energy monitoring MIB groups 
        that are supported by the local management system. By reading 
        the value of this object, it is possible for applications to 
        know which tables contain the information and are usable without 
        walking through the table and querying every element which 
        involves a trial-and-error process. 
         
         
        The power measurement of an Energy Object contains information 
        describing its power usage (eoPower) and its current power state 
        (eoPowerOperState). In addition to power usage, additional 
        information describing the units of measurement 
        (eoPowerAccuracy, eoPowerUnitMultiplier), how power usage 
        measurement was obtained  (eoPowerMeasurementCaliber),  the 
        source of power  (eoPowerOrigin) and the type of power 
        (eoPowerCurrentTtype) are described. 
         
         
        An Energy Object may contain an optional eoPowerAttributes table 
        that describes the electrical characteristics associated with 
        the current power state and usage. 
         
        An Energy Object may contain an optional eoEnergyTable to 
        describe energy measurement information over time. 
         
        An Energy Object may also contain optional battery information 
        associated with this entity.

        This section records the status of known implementations of the 
        EMAN-Monitoring MIB at the time of posting of this Internet-
        Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC6982]. 
            
        The description of implementations in this section is intended 
        to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing 
        drafts to RFCs.

             Implementation experience:  The MIB modules are implemented 
                         on Cisco router platforms to measure and report 
                         router energy measurements. The documents are

     12. Security Considerations 

         

        Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects 
        with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is 
        thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these 
        objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects 
        when sending them over the network via SNMP.   
         
        There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB 
        modules with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
        create.  Such objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable 
        in some network environments.  The support for SET operations in 
        a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a 
        negative effect on network operations.  The following are the 
        tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         
        - Unauthorized changes to the eoPowerOperState (via 
          theeoPowerAdminState ) MAY disrupt the power settings of the 
          differentEnergy Objects, and therefore the state of 
          functionality of the respective Energy Objects. 
        - Unauthorized changes to the eoEnergyParametersTable MAY 
          disrupt energy measurement in the eoEnergyTable table.  
         
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using 
        IPsec), there is still no secure control over who on the secure 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>         Expires April 21, 2014         [Page 72] 
         
     Internet-Draft   <Power and Energy Monitoring MIB>  October 2013 
      
        network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB modules. 
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 
         
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 
         

     13. IANA Considerations 

     13.1. IANA Considerations for the MIB Modules 

      

        The MIB modules in this document uses the following IANA-
        assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers 
        registry: 
         
               Descriptor            OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
               ----------            ----------------------- 
               energyObjectMib            { mib-2 xxx } 
               powerAttributesMIB         { mib-2 yyy } 
         
        Additions to the MIB modules are subject to Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        requested MIB objects for completeness and accuracy of the 
        description.  Requests for MIB objects that duplicate the 
        functionality of existing objects SHOULD be declined.  The 
        smallest available OIDs SHOULD be assigned to the new MIB 
        objects.  The specification of new MIB objects SHOULD follow the 
        structure specified in Section 10.  and MUST be published using 
        a well-established and persistent publication medium.   
      

     13.2. IANA Registration of new Power State Set

        with the initial set of Power State Sets and the Power States 
        within those Power State Sets as proposed in the [EMAN-FMWK]. 
        The current version of IANAPowerStateSet Textual convention can 
        be accessed http://www.iana.org/assignments/IANAPowerStateSet 
         
        New Assignments to Power State Sets shall be administered by 
        IANA and the guidelines and procedures are specified in [EMAN-
        FMWK].  
      
      
     13.2.1. IANA Registration of the IEEE1621 Power State Set 

        The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has created a new 
        registry for IEEE1621 Power State Set identifiers and filled it 
        with the initial list in the Textual Convention 
        IANAPowerStateSet.  
         
        Guidelines for new assignments (or potentially deprecation) for 
        IEEE1621 Power State Set are specified in [EMAN-FMWK]. 
         
     13.2.2. IANA Registration of the DMTF Power State Set 

        The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has created a new 
        registry for DMTF Power State Set identifiers and filled it in 
        the Textual Convention IANAPowerStateSet. 
         
        Guidelines for new assignments (or potentially deprecation) for 
        DMTF Power State Set are specified in [EMAN-FMWK]. 
         
      
         
     13.2.3. IANA Registration of the EMAN Power State Set 

        The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has created a new 
        registry for EMAN Power State Set identifiers and filled it in 
        the Textual Convention IANAPowerStateSet. 
         
        Guidelines for new assignments (or potentially deprecation) for 
        EMAN Power State Set are specified in [EMAN-FMWK]. 
         
         
     13.3. Updating the Registration of Existing Power State Sets  

        IANA maintains a Textual Convention IANAPowerStateSet with the 
        initial set of Power State Sets and the Power States within 
        those Power State Sets.  The current version of Textual 
        convention can be accessed 
        http://www.iana.org/assignments/IANAPowerStateSet

     Internet-Draft   <Power and Energy Monitoring MIB>  October 2013 
      
         
        With the evolution of standards, over time, it may be important 
        to deprecate of some of the existing the Power State Sets or 
        some of the states within a Power State Set.  
         
        The registrant shall publish an Internet-draft or an individual 
        submission with the clear specification on deprecation of Power 
        State Sets or Power States registered with IANA.  The 
        deprecation shall be administered by IANA through Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director. The process should also allow for a 
        mechanism for cases where others have significant objections to 
        claims on deprecation of a registration. In cases, where the 
        registrant cannot be reached, IESG can designate an Expert to 
        modify the IANA registry for the deprecation.
