1. Introduction

   Networks are usually provisioned for peak hours and potential network
   failures. Network devices are powered on all the time without
   consideration on energy efficient. In practice, however, the traffic
   load of a network is low most of the time and redundant network
   equipments are used for failure recovery occasionally.

   In the past years, vendors had paid a great effort on improving the
   network energy efficiency at the device level: when the traffic load
   is low, a network equipment should accordingly operate with less
   power draw. However, network equipments have never become fully power
   proportional. Even few or no traffic is carried, a powered-on network
   device draws a considerable amount of power, which means energy is
   being wasted. There is an explicit gap that idle network devices are
   shut down or put into sleeping state to save more energy. In order to
   fill this gap, the network control plane and management system should
   become power aware (i.e., Power Aware NETwork, PANET) to coordinate
   network devices therefore the sleeping or powered-off network devices
   do not bring service disruption to the network. 

   The design space and problem areas of PANET is outlined in [PANET-
   problem]. The requirements for PANET is given in [PANET-
   requirements]. This documents investigated use cases on PANET which
   include both backbone networks and data center networks. As for the
   energy efficiency of backbone networks, only intra-domain use cases
   are considered. Trying to be energy efficient in the inter-domain
   scale seems technically feasible. But currently, energy efficient
   solutions can easily end up with lack of business motivation. This
   document leaves them for future study.

2. Power Awareness in Backbone Networks

   The IETF Energy Management (eman) Working Group works on the
   management of power-aware network devices. Basically, the power
   states of power-aware network devices are reported and recorded in
   MIB. However, there is a gap on how to make use of this kind of data
   to achieve energy efficient networks. With energy aware control plane

   [power-control], it becomes possible to make use of these
   measurements and power control ability to achieve the energy
   efficiency of a whole network. This section lists several use cases
   for backbone networks.

   Take a router system as an example, the start-up of it may take
   several minutes and the stabilization of it may takes much longer
   time. It is unrealistic to switch off and on a whole node in backbone
   networks frequently to achieve energy efficient, so this document
   only investigates the cases in which links (i.e., links' attached
   components) are shut-down or put into sleeping state for energy
   conservation.

2.1. Use Case 1: Sleeping Links 

   The power draw on line-cards occupies a great portion in the total
   power consumption of a whole routing system. For high-end routers,
   this portion may be higher than 50%.

   Network devices and their processing capacity are provisioned for
   worst cases such as traffic burst and busy hours. Most of the time,
   the network is lightly loaded. Unfortunately, the power consumption
   of network devices is not proportional to the traffic load on them.
   An extreme case is that even there is no load on them, there is still
   a considerable base power consumption. Unlike personal PCs which can
   be shut down or enter power saving modes (such as sleeping), network
   devices are powered on and running even there is no load on them.
   This reality means that the network is wasting lots of power.

   The conception that "a link is put into sleep state" is frequently
   mentioned in various technical documents. In this document, this
   conception is formalized as follows. The coupled end-points (such as
   interfaces, NPU or whole line-cards) attached to a idle link enter
   the sleeping mode to save energy. Similarly, the wake up of a link
   also means the wake of of those coupled end-points.

Figure 2.1: Aggregate traffic to create opportunities for link sleeping

   Traffic aggregation are used to create the opportunity for more links
   to become idle. This process can be automated through the control
   plane [power-control]. Traffic Engineering technique is able to
   achieve this kind of traffic aggregation [GreenTE]. Take Figure 2.1
   as an example, suppose R1, R2, R3 and R4 is sending traffic to R3,
   R4, R1 and R2 and R4 respectively. In Figure 2.1 (a), paths R1-R2-R3,
   R2-R3-R4, R3-R4-R1 and R4-R1-R2 are being used. All links are active.
   In Figure (b), paths R1-R2-R3, R2-R3-R4, R3-R2-R1 and R4-R3-R2 are
   being used. Link R1-R4 is idle, therefore it can be put into sleeping
   state to save energy.

   Different from traditional Traffic Engineering techniques which aim
   to balance traffic load around the whole network to avoid hot spots,
   green Traffic Engineering try to create more idle links which can be
   put into sleeping state. However, this kind of traffic aggregation
   should be restricted. At least, green Traffic Engineering SHOULD NOT
   achieve energy conservation at the expense of apparently downgrade
   the network performance. It is recommended that the QoS metric should
   be take into consideration as constraints of green Traffic
   Engineering. The traffic aggregation which can violate these
   constraints should be avoid.

   With the traffic load fluctuating, the green Traffic Engineering
   should be periodically performed. When the network is lightly loaded,
   the GreenTE should be able to put more links to be idle. When the
   network is heavily loaded, GreenTE should remain more links in active
   state to absorb more traffic in order to avoid traffic jam.

                 Figure 2.2: Multicast Forwarding Plane

   It's possible to wake up a link or put it into sleeping sate at the
   management plane by operators. However, the state change impacts the
   data plane of the network. Take Figure 2.1 as an example, if link R1-
   R4 is sleeping, it will cut off the path R3-R4-R1 and R4-R1-R2.
   Therefore, the paths in Figure 2.1 (b) should be used. Data plane for
   multicast traffic may also be affected. Take Figure 2.2 as an
   example, in order to avoid being affected by the sleeping link, the
   multicast tree in Figure 2.2 (b) should be used rather than that in
   Figure 2.2 (a). It requires a knob to achieve the adjustment of data
   plane via the control plane. Before a link is to be put in to sleep
   state, operators may increase its link metric to disperse the traffic
   load on it. This will cause the update of FIBs of routers [RFC6976].
   The mechanism defined in [RFC6976] can be adopted. 

   Sleeping links are different from failed links since they can be
   waken up to relieve the traffic jam when it becomes necessary. This
   difference creates the necessity for the network to remember these
   links in order to make decision to wake them up at a proper time.

2.1.2 Gathering Information for Decision Making

   The decision of the Traffic Engineering may be centrally made on a
   NOC (Network Operation Center) or distributedly carried out by each
   router. However, when decisions are distributedly made, the
   consistence of decisions MUST be guaranteed. It requires that the
   algorithm of the Traffic Engineering always generate the same
   result.

   Where ever the decision point locates, the traffic demand of the
   network is the necessary input for Traffic Engineering. This
   information should be measured and maintained. For example, network
   elements (routers and switches) can gather flow data and export it to
   the collectors using Netflow [RFC3954]. For another example, a cyclic
   number of bytes transmitted and received on each of those interfaces
   of a line-card in maintained in the Management Information Base (MIB)
   via Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The Network Management
   System (NMS) may periodically poll these numbers to compute the

   links' load. The traffic matrix of the network can be further
   estimated from those links' load [TMEstimated].

   Compared to traditional Traffic Engineering, power aware Traffic
   Engineering additionally requires the information about the power
   consumption of network devices of the network. It is requires a MIB
   module for monitoring energy consumption and power states of energy-
   aware devices [eman].

   The essentials of this use case:

   o  Devices to be Power Aware: Routers, NOC, etc.

   o  What actions to take: NMS (Network Management System) polls the
      traffic load and power consumption profile of each link; Routers
      execute the green TE algorithm; Routers send out signals to
      trigger the sleeping/wake-up transition of a NPU on a line card. 

2.2. Use Case 2: Composite Links

   A composite link is a logical link composed of multiple physical [I-
   D.ietf-rtgwg-cl-requirement] links. The composite link attached end-
   points are responsible to map traffic onto the component links and
   maintain the state of the composite link. Power awareness can be
   applied to composite links as well. When the traffic volume on a
   composite link is low, some component links can be shut down to
   conserve energy consumption. When the traffic volume becomes high,
   the sleeping component links can be waken up to absorb the traffic
   load.

   Compared to use case 1, the advantage of executing energy saving for
   composite link is that the connectivity of the composite link does
   not suffer unless all the component links are sleeping. In this way,
   the control plane of the component link is not disrupted. When the
   end points of the composite link execute the energy conservation
   action, they can do it in a distributed way and decisions are made
   locally.

   The essentials of this use case:

   o  Devices to be Power Aware: Composite links attached end-points.

   o  What actions to take: NMS measures the traffic load and power
      profile of component links; Attached end-points adaptively put
      component links into sleeping state or wake them up according to
      the traffic load on the composite link. 

   Use case 1 and use case 2 may be combined in a real network to

   achieve more energy saving.

2.3. Coordinating L2 and L3 Sleeping Links

   Networks devices are usually redundantly provided. However, they may
   spend a lot of time operating at its full rate while caring few or no
   traffic, especially at the edge of the network. Manufactures have put
   a lot of effort to produce energy efficient network devices. However,
   fully power proportional network devices are hard, even impossible,
   to be implemented. Take switches of the day for example, when they
   are left idle, there is only a low teens of power reduction compared
   to the peak power [Sx700]. This means a considerable amount of energy
   is being wasted when no traffic is being delivered. Modern processors
   support a number of states, which enables various network components
   to sleep [C-Sleep]. When a network component becomes idle, it's
   reasonable for them to enter the sleep mode to save energy. 

   Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) provides a mechanism and standard for
   Ethernet links to operate in an energy-efficient way [802.3az]. The
   PHY connecting an Ethernet link can enter Low Power Idle mode (i.e.,
   sleep mode) to reduce the energy consumption when no data packet is
   being sent on the link. Normally, PHY need be refreshed periodically
   during the LPI. When the signaling protocol indicates the PHY to wake
   up, it SHOULD resume in a pre-defined delay (Time to Wake, Tw). This
   pre-defined delay is the time the transmitter transmitting a maximum
   length Ethernet frame. For example, Tw for 1000BASE-T is 16.5uS,
   which is the same time that it takes to transmit a 2000-byte Ethernet
   frame [C.I.EEE]. The transmitter can buffer packets during the time
   that the receiver transiting from the LPI mode to the active mode.
   This Wake on Arrival mechanism guarantees that EEE does not interfere
   with upper layer application protocols (e.g., ISIS). Beyond PHY,
   other network equipments (such as NPUs, line-cards, or whole
   switches/routers) may also enter sleep mode, which usually means a
   much longer time to wake up but a much higher energy saving. The EEE
   standard also supports PHYs to enter a deep sleep mode through
   negotiating a larger value of Tw using the link-layer discovery
   protocol (LLDP) [802.1ab].

   Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) protocol makes use of gaps in the
   data stream to put transceivers attached to an Ethernet link into
   sleep state to save energy consumption [802.3az]. Without expectation
   of the arrival of packets, the L2 sleeping is actually an
   opportunistic sleeping. This kind of opportunistic sleeping is
   performed locally without coordination of nodes across the network
   wide. At L3, we can plan the sleeping which help to achieve energy
   savings beyond physical layer transceiver (PHY) of Ethernet links. 

   With traffic aggregation realized through network-wide green routing

INTERNET-DRAFT     Use Cases for Power-Aware Networks   October 12, 2013


   and traffic engineering, idle links of an L3 network can be scheduled
   to enter sleep mode for a while to save energy consumption. If a link
   is scheduled to sleep at L3, no packets will be sent on this link for
   a longer time (minutes or hours) [GreenTE]. It's feasible for this
   link to negotiate a longer value of Tw at L2 and enter the deep sleep
   mode to save more energy. Compared to a normal L2 link, the scheduled
   sleeping link has a longer LPI and less wake up actions, which also
   leads to more energy savings.

   On the other hand, if a link is scheduled to be active at L3, the
   opportunity for this link to enter LPI mode may become slim. It may
   be better to disable the sleep mode of this link at L2 to avoid the
   frequent transitioning between LPI and active mode, therefore avoids
   extra energy consumption and instability of the network.

3. Power Aware in Data Center Networks

   Servers and network devices (ICT equipments) are intensively placed
   in Data Centers. In comparison with ISP backbone networks, the
   operating of Data Center Networks are more power hungry. The growing
   amount of energy consumed by a Data Center has led to high operating
   costs. The work load of a data center varies due to the effect of
   "follow-the-sun". There is a significant opportunity to conserve the
   energy consumption through right-sizing the ICT infrastructure when
   the work load is low.

   Although non-ICT equipments, such as lighting and air conditioners,
   in a Data Center consumes a notable large amount of energy as well,
   this section concentrate on talking about right-sizing the ICT
   infrastructure for energy conservation. Energy conservation of non-
   ICT equipments are out of the scope of this document.

               Figure 3.1: VM Placement and Consolidation

   With Operating System virtualization, one physical server can provide
   tens of Virtual Machines (VM) at the same time. Network
   Virtualization technology makes the placement and migration easy for
   VMs [nvo3usecase]. With live migration, VM can change its host server
   (location) without disruption of services running on it [VMmove]. As
   shown in Figure 3.1, VMs migrate out from server 2, server 3 to
   server 1, server 4 respectively. When Server 2 and server 3 are
   idled, they can be put into sleep state to save energy consumption.

   With virtualization technology, VMs of a Data Center or multiple Data
   Centers can be consolidated to fewer physical servers while idled
   servers can be put into power saving mode or turned off to achieve
   energy conservation. Virtualization technology allows the
   administration of a Data Center Network respond rapidly to the
   fluctuating capacity requirements.

   Through monitoring of the work load and power profile, the Data
   Center Network Management System (Orchestrator) can judge in which
   hours workload is high and in which hours workload is low. For
   example, nights are generally off-peak hours in which workload is at
   low level. Virtual machines can be moved to fewer servers therefore
   idle servers can powered off or put into sleep to save energy. Before
   peak hours (e.g., in the morning), sleeping or powered off servers
   should be waken up to accommodate more active virtual machines
   (VMs).

   o  What actions to take: NMS measures the work load and power profile
      of servers; The orchestrator of a Data Center Network adaptively
      triggers the actions of VM migration, the power-off and power-on
      of servers according to the workload.

3.2. Use Case 4: Elastic Infrastructure

   Traffic load of a data center is generated by the work load on
   servers and applied on the network infrastructure. The changing work
   load determines that the traffic load varies as time goes on.
   However, network devices are always powered on even though the
   traffic load fluctuates, which wastes energy inevitably when the
   traffic load is low. 

   Ideally, the network infrastructure is elastic and can fit the
   traffic pattern with minimum subset to minimize the energy
   consumption of the network infrastructure. For now, Data Center
   Networks generally work at layer 2. So this use case should be
   realized through manipulating switching paths, in comparison with the
   power aware routing at layer 3. Openflow switches may be utilized to
   achieve this goal [ElasticTree]. 

   The essentials of this use case:

   o  Devices to be Power Aware: All network equipments in a data
      center.

   o  What actions to take: Network devices report their traffic load
      and power consumption profile to the NMS. The orchestrator (NMS)
      of a Data Center Network adaptively build the switching paths upon
      the network infrastructure. The idled links are put into power
      saving mode (e.g., sleeping), so that the network infrastructure
      becomes energy efficient.

           Figure 3.2: Elastic Data Center ICT Infrastructure

   As shown in Figure 3.2, when servers are idled and put into sleeping
   state, their up connected switches may also become idle. Therefore,
   use case 3 and use case 4 can be combined to achieve more energy
   saving.

                  Figure 3.3: Adaptive Job Scheduling

   An cloud service provider may have multiple data centers which spread
   out in different geographic locations. Generally, the ICT resources
   in these data centers are well replicated and a job can be directed
   to any of them for execution. These data centers form a large
   distributed Internet scale systems and the price of power supply for
   them varies between two different locations. The operating cost of
   such a system highly depends on the load scheduling scheme. Being

   power aware, the system can map requests to locations where energy
   price is cheaper.  

   This use case makes use of the difference of the prices of power draw
   in different locations. The orchestrator of data centers (the NMS) is
   responsible for monitoring the power profile and work load of the ICT
   devices located in different data centers, and adaptively schedule
   the jobs among these data centers. Orchestration protocols are
   necessary to support the job scheduling [Orchestration].

   As shown in Figure 3.3, the orchestrator map the user request (job)
   to with an economic attachment to either Site A or Site B, while the
   user is unaware of the executing point of the job. In this way, the
   job scheduling becomes a trade-off between OPEX and performance. The
   orchestrator should guaranteed that there is no apparent service
   performance degradation. Complex SLA fulfillment may be designed to
   embody the response time, throughput, latency, etc.

   The essentials of this use case:

   o  Devices to be Power Aware: All ICT-equipments in a data center.

   o  What actions to take: ICT devices report their work load and power
      consumption profile to NMS. The orchestrator (NMS) of the Data
      Center Networks adaptively map the request onto sites in
      consideration of reducing the overall power bill of the system.
