                Associate PW label with PTP application
             draft-fuxh-tictoc-associate-pw-with-ptp-00.txt

Abstract

   [1588overMPLS] defines two methods for transporting PTP messages
   (PDUs) over an MPLS network.  The second method is to transport PTP
   messages inside a PW via Ethernet encapsulation.  When PHP is applied
   to PTP LSP or the PW is etablished between two routers directly and
   no PTP LSP is needed, PW label must be associated with PTP
   application at the PW termination point.  This document introduces a
   mechanism to associate PW label with PTP application.

Internet-Draft          PW Label,Association,PTP            October 2011


1.  Introduction

   [1588overMPLS] defines two methods for transporting PTP messages
   (PDUs) over an MPLS network.  The second method is to transport PTP
   messages inside a PW via Ethernet encapsulation.  When PHP is applied
   to PTP LSP or the PW is etablished between two routers directly and
   no PTP LSP is needed, PW label must be associated with PTP
   application at the PW termination point.  This document extend LDP
   and BGP to associate PW label with PTP application.


2.  PTP-Aware Capability Advertisement

   It is useful for PW switching point to announce its capabilities,
   such as the capability to be PTP-aware.  So both PW switching points
   could know each other of the PTP-aware capability.  If both of them
   could support PTP-aware, PTP PW label could be coordinated during the
   label mapping.

2.1.  LDP Extension

   [RFC5561] defines a mechanism for advertising LDP enhancements at
   session initialization time.  So LDP capability advertisement
   provides means for an LDP speaker to announce what it can receive and
   process.  This document introduces a new Capability Parameter TLV,
   the PTP-Aware Capability.  Following is the format of the PTP-Aware
   Capability Parameter.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |1|0|  PTP-Aware Capability(TBD)|     Length (= 1)              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |1| Reserved    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                    Figure 1: PTP-Aware Capability TLV

   The PTP-Aware Capability TLV MUST be supported in the LDP
   Initialization Message([RFC5561]).  Advertisement of the PTP-Aware
   Capability indicates that the PW switching point supports PTP message
   processing and PTP application association

2.2.  BGP Extension

   TBD

Internet-Draft          PW Label,Association,PTP            October 2011


3.  PTP Application Association

   When PTP LSP isn't be present, PW switching point must associate the
   top label (aka PW Label) with PTP application so that it can identify
   PTP traffic carried in the PW.

   This PTP application association relationship could be configured by
   management system.  It could also be configure by dynamic control
   plane.  This document introduces LDP/BGP extension to signal that
   this PW segment is a PTP PW.

3.1.  LDP Extension

   [RFC3036] defines the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) for
   distributing labels.  This document defines a new TLV, PTP
   Association TLV which can be used to indicate a PW is associated with
   PTP traffic.  This TLV is carried in the Label Mapping message.

   The PTP Association TLV, is defined as follows (TLV type needs to be
   assigned by IANA):

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |1|1|    PTP Association(TBD)   |       Length (= 1)            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      Offset to locate the start of the PTP message header     |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                       Figure 2: PTP Association TLV

   The OFFSET to the start of the PTP message header MAY also be
   signaled.  Implementations can trivially locate the correctionField
   (CF) location given this information.  The OFFSET points to the start
   of the PTP header as a node may want to check the PTP messageType
   before it touches the correctionField (CF).

   The T-PE or S-PE must include this object in the LDP Mapping Message
   when it want to request a PTP label or advertise a PTP label to a
   peer.

3.2.  BGP Extension

   TBD
