    RADIUS Option for DHCPv6 Relay Agents on Broadband Access Server
                  draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-radius-opt-00

Abstract

   The DHCPv6 RADIUS option provides a communication mechanism between
   relay agent and the server.  This mechanism can help the centralized
   DHCPv6 server to select the right configuration for the client based
   on the authorization information received from a separate RADIUS
   server which is not located at the same place of DHCPv6 server in the
   cases where the NAS acts as DHCPv6 relay agent and RADIUS client
   simultaneously.

Internet-Draft            DHCPv6 RADIUS Option                  May 2012


1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 provides a mechanism that allows the server to assign or
   delegate both stateful and stateless configuration parameters to the
   clients.  The stateful configuration parameters include IPv6 address
   [RFC3315], IPv6 prefix [RFC3633], and etc.  The stateless
   configuration parameters [RFC3736] include, for example, DNS
   [RFC3646].  The DHCPv6 server is typically deployed in the central
   part of an ISP network.

   RADIUS [RFC2865], an essentially stateless protocol, is used widely
   as the centralized authentication, authorization and user management
   mechanism for the service provision in Broadband access network.
   [RFC3162], [RFC4818] and [ietf-radext-ipv6-access-06] specify
   attributes that supports the provision of service for IPv6 access.
   RADIUS authorizes that the NAS assigns an IPv6 address or prefix from
   the indicated pool, or assigns an IPv6 address or prefix with an
   explicitly indicated value in the attributes for the subscribers.

   These mechanisms work well in the deployment scenario where the NAS
   acts as the distributed DHCPv6 server.  In this case the NAS responds
   as the indication conveyed by the attributes in the Access-Accept
   message from the RADIUS server.  These mechanisms also work in the
   scenario where the centralized DHCPv6 server is co-located with the
   RADIUS server, where they can share the same database of the users.
   But when the NAS acts as the relay agent and RADIUS client
   simultaneously, and the centralized DHCPv6 server is not located in
   the same place as the RADIUS server, a new communication mechanism is
   needed for the relay agent to transfer the authorization information
   indicated by the RADIUS attributes to the DHCPv6 server.


2.  Terminology and Language

   This document specifies a DHCPv6 option for the distributed Relay
   Agent to transfer the authorization information of RADIUS attributes
   received in the Access-Accept message to the centralized DHCPv6
   server.  This document should be read in conjunction with the
   following specifications: [RFC2865], [RFC2869], [RFC3315] and
   [RFC4818].  These specifications will help the reader to understand
   how DHCPv6 and RADIUS work together to provide IPv6 service.
   Definitions for terms and acronyms not specified in this document are
   defined in [RFC2865], [RFC2869], [RFC3315] and [RFC4818].

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

3.  Network Scenarios

   Figure 1 and Figure 2 shows the typical network scenarios where the
   communication mechanism introduced in this document is necessary.  In
   these scenarios, the centralized DHCPv6 server is not co-located with
   the RADIUS server, but both of them are in the same administrative
   domain.  The NAS acts as the relay agent and the RADIUS client
   simultaneously.  Figure 1 shows the sequence of DHCPv6 and RADIUS
   messages for IPoE access mode.  Figure 2 shows the sequence of DHCPv6
   and RADIUS messages for PPPoE access mode.

   from the client to the server.


4.  OPTION_RADIUS

   The OPTION_RADIUS is a stateless DHCPv6 option, and is used by the
   relay agent to carry the authorization information of RADIUS
   attributes received in the Access-Accept message.

   The format of the OPTION_RADIUS option is defined as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   option-code      TBD
   option-length    Length of the option-data in Octets
   option-data      One or a list of RADIUS Attributes

   The option-data of OPTION_RADIUS is one or a list of RADIUS
   attributes received in the Access-Accept message from the RADIUS
   server.  As the same method in [RFC4014], only the attributes listed
   in the table below may be included in the OPTION_RADIUS.

   Type Code    Attribute                Reference
   26           Vendor-Specific          [RFC2865]
   88           Framed-Pool              [RFC2869]
   123          Delegated-IPv6-Prefix    [RFC4818]
   [TBD]        Framed-IPv6-Address      [ietf-radext-ipv6-access-06]

   Note: The above table might have more attributes in the future.


5.  Relay Agent Behavior

   The DHCPv6 relay agent may include OPTION_RADIUS in the RELAY-FORW
   message.  When the value in the attributes of Framed-Pool (88), (or
   Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool, Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool,) Delegated-
   IPv6-Prefix (123) and Framed-IPv6-Address in the Access-Accept
   message replied from RADIUS server are valid, the relay agent that
   supports OPTION_RADIUS SHOULD include these RADIUS attributes in the
   container option, OPTION_RADIUS.  The relay agent MUST ignore
   OPTION_RADIUS if received.

Internet-Draft            DHCPv6 RADIUS Option                  May 2012


6.  Server Behavior

   Upon receipt of the RELAY-FORW message with OPTION_RADIUS from a
   relay agent, the DHCPv6 server SHOULD extract and interpret the
   RADIUS attributes in the OPTION_RADIUS, and use that information in
   selecting configuration parameters for the requesting client.  If the
   DHCPv6 server does not support OPTION_RADIUS, the DHCPv6 server
   SHOULD ignore this option.  The DHCPv6 server MUST NOT include
   OPTION_RADIUS in RELAY-REPL messages.


7.  Client Behavior

   OPTION_RADIUS option is only exchanged between the relay agents and
   the servers.  DHCPv6 clients are not aware of the usage of
   OPTION_RADIUS.  DHCPv6 Client MUST NOT send OPTION_RADIUS, and MUST
   ignore OPTION_RADIUS if received.


8.  Security Considerations

   Known security vulnerabilities of the DHCPv6 and RADIUS protocol may
   apply to its options.  Security issues related with DHCPv6 are
   described in section 23 of [RFC3315].  Security issues related with
   RADIUS are described in section 8 of [RFC2865], section 5 of
   [RFC3162].


9.  IANA Considerations

   The authors of this document request to assign a new DHCPv6 option
   code for OPTION_RADIUS.
