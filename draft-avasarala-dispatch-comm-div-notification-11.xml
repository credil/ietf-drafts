<abstract>
   <t> 3GPP and TISPAN are defining the protocol specification for the
   Communication Diversion (CDIV) service using IP Multimedia (IM) Core
   Network (CN) subsystem (IMS) supplementary service.  As part of CDIV, a SIP
   based event package is used for notifying users about
   diversions (re-directions or forwarding) of requests for
   communication sessions targetting the user.  This document defines 
   the SIP event package to support subscription and notification of 
   diversions.  The proposed event package is
   applicable to the CDIV supplementary service in IMS and may not be
   applicable to the general internet.
   </t>

<section title="Introduction" toc="default">
<t> 3GPP is currently maintaining and specifying communication diversion
   mechanisms which allow users to forward and/or redirect incoming
   communications to other destinations.  A common
   example is Communication Forward On Busy (CFB) wherein users can instruct a server in the network to
   redirect incoming requests, whilst they are participating in a session.
   Similarly, other variants of communication diversion are well defined
   and used in practice such as Communication Forward on subscriber Not Reachable
   (CFNRc), Communication Forward Unconditional (CFU), Communication Forwarding No Reply (CFNR), 
   Communication Deflection (CD), and Communication Forwarding on Not Logged-in (CFNL).  3GPP is
   currently maintaining and specifying a mechanism for users to
   configure Communication Diversion Services (3GPP TS 24.604 <xref target="3GPP.24.604"></xref>) for their
   incoming communications.  

<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
   The mechanism for users to configure Communication Diversion Services (3GPP TS 24.604 <xref target="3GPP.24.604"></xref>) may cause a variety of rules 
   to be provisioned in the network at the same time.  For instance, a 
   user may have, in addition to other communication diversion rules, 
   various CDIV services configured, e.g. some rules based on the 
   time-of-the-day and some rules based on the calling party's identity.  
   It is possible that the user loses track of the various rules and 
   undesirable diversions may occur. If the user cann't notified of the diversions,
   then it is hard for the user to determine that the combination of rules have
   caused undesirable diversions.

<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
CDIV Notification (CDIVN) is a CDIV service providing the user the capability to 
   receive notifications about all diverted communications (CFU, CFB, CFNR, CD, CFNRc and CFNL).
   If CDIVN is configured, when a communication is diverted on behalf of the subscriber, the Subcsriber receives a notification.
   The subscriber is then in able to determine whether the communication diversion
   which just occurred, was indeed as per their expectation.  For example,
   a subscriber intended to divert all incoming calls to voice-mail,
   between 3.00 p.m. to 4.00 p.m.  Yet, by mistake she configures the
   time-duration as 3.00 to 4.00 p.m.  It would be very difficult for
   her to spot this error while manually reviewing her complete set of
   communication diversion services, with their various configurations.
   Instead, if the subscriber receives a real-time notification of any
   communication diversion occurring after 4 p.m., she would be able to
   immediately guess that something is 'wrong' or not as per her
   intention and take corrective action.  Such corrective action could
   be manual verification of the specific rule which triggered the
   communication diversion, wherein she will be able to spot the
   "mistake" more easily.
<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
Thus, for effective subscriber services management of multiple
   configurations of various Communication Diversion services, a
   notification-based mechanism may work well.  Such a mechanism would
   involve notifying subscribers about diversions of their incoming
   communications, as and when the communication diversion happens or
   with a slight delay (as per subscriber service configuration).  As
   such diversion-related information is conveyed almost instantly or
   within a small time-frame, the subscribers can verify whether the
   particular communication diversion is indeed correct at that instant
   of time.
<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
This document defines a SIP event package that allows a SIP User
   Agents to subscribe to and be notified of communication diversions
   enacted on their behalf using the CDIV service. The protocol specification for the
   CDIV service (using IMS core networks) can be found in 3GPP TS 24.604 <xref target="3GPP.24.604"></xref>.

<section title="Terminology">
<t> In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>
   and indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.  </t>
</section>
<section title="Applicability Statement">
<t> It is believed that the SIP event package defined here is not applicable to the general Internet; it has been designed to serve the
architecture of the CDIV service (see 3GPP TS 24.604 <xref target="3GPP.24.604"></xref>) in IMS core networks 
3GPP TS 24.229 (see <xref target="3GPP.24.229"></xref>). The aim of this memo is to follow the procedure indicated in RFC 5727.
<xref target="RFC5727"></xref> and to register a new event package with event name "comm-div-info" with IANA.

</t>
</section>
<section title="Package Definition">
<t> This section fills in the details needed for an event package as defined in Section 4.4 of <xref target="RFC3265"></xref>.</t>
<section title="Event Package Name">
<t> The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to specify the name of their package or template-package.
<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
The name of this package is "comm-div-info". As specified in <xref target="RFC3265"></xref>, this value appears in the Event
header present in SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests. </t>
</section>
<section title="Event Package Parameters">
<t> The SIP Events specification <xref target="RFC3265"></xref> allows packages to define additional parameters. This event package 
 "comm-div-info" does not define additional parameters.
</t>
</section>
<section title="SUBSCRIBE bodies">
<t> The SIP Events specification requires package or template-package definitions to define the usage, 
if any, of message bodies in SUBSCRIBE requests. Furthermore, the SIP Events specification requires that message bodies are specified or that 
   detailed specifications for the syntax and semantics of such a message body are cited.
<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
A SUBSCRIBE for Communication Diversion event MAY contain a message body. The purpose of the body depends on its type. Subscriptions to
the Comm-div-info event package SHALL only include a message body of MIME type "application/vnd.3gpp.comm-div-info+xml". The syntax and 
semantics of the message body can be found in 3GPP TS 24.604 <xref target="3GPP.24.604"></xref>.
<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
A body of the SUBSCRIBE request with content type set to MIME type
   "application/comm-div-info-filter+xml" contains information about the
   communication diversion notification information filter criteria and
   notification trigger criteria.  The subscriber SHALL also verify that
   this information conforms to a valid XML document as defined in [11].
   The subscriber SHALL also verify that the information contained in
   the XML document contains elements defined in <xref target="3GPP.24.604"></xref>.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Subscription Duration">
<t> The default expiration time for subscriptions within this package is 3600 seconds. 
    As per <xref target='RFC3265'></xref>, the subscriber
    MAY specify an alternate expiration in the Expires header field.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Notify bodies">
<t>The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to define a default value for subscription durations, and to discuss 
reasonable choices for durations when they are explicitly specified. 
<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
The NOTIFY message contains an event body.  This event body is in a format listed in the Accept header field of the SUBSCRIBE request 
or a package specific default format if the Accept header field was omitted from the SUBSCRIBE request. 
Furthermore, the SIP Events specification requires that event bodies are specified or that detailed specifications for the 
syntax and semantics of such a event body are cited.
<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
In this event package, the body of the notification contains the communication diversion information pertaining to the diversion
that occurred in the network on behalf of the subscriber. The package specific body has the MIME type 
"application/vnd.3gpp.comm-div-info+xml". The syntax and semantics of the event body can be found in 
3GPP TS 24.604 <xref target="3GPP.24.604"></xref>. 

<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
A subscriber must 
always Accept receiving a NOTIFY with Content-Type "application/vnd.3gpp.comm-div-info+xml".  The notifiers MUST be capable of accepting  
the "application/vnd.3gpp.comm-div-info+xml" data format as described in 3GPP TS 24.604 <xref target="3GPP.24.604"></xref>. If the notifier 
sends a NOTIFY, it MUST include contents according to 3GPP TS 24.604 <xref target="3GPP.24.604"></xref> and include the 
content-type header field set to "application/vnd.3gpp.comm-div-info+xml".
<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
The default Accept header field for SUBSCRIBE is "application/vnd.3gpp.comm-div-info+xml" (assuming Event header has a value of "comm-div-info-ntfy"). 
</t>
</section>

<section title="Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE requests" anchor="NotifierP">
<t>
The contents of a "application/vnd.3gpp.comm-div-info+xml" XML document in a NOTIFY request can contain sensitive information 
that can reveal some privacy 
information.  Therefore, such documents MUST only be sent to authorized subscribers. In order to determine if a 
subscription originates in an authorized user, the subscriber MUST be authenticated as described in <xref target="Auth"></xref>
and then the user MUST be authorized to be a subscriber as described in <xref target="Autho"></xref>.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
The Notifier MUST check if the SUBSCRIBE request contains a body part. If there is a body part, the Notifier MUST do the following.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
Check if a SUBSCRIBE request body part conforms to "application/vnd.3gpp.comm-div-info+xml" XML Schema document in 3GPP TS 24.604 <xref target="3GPP.24.604"></xref>. 
If it conforms then the Notifier processes the document and generates notifications accordingly. 
</t>
<section title="Authentication" anchor="Auth">
<t>Notifiers MUST authenticate all subscription requests.  This authentication can be done using any of the mechanisms defined in
<xref target="RFC3261"></xref> and other authentication extensions.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Authorization" anchor="Autho">
<t>Once authenticated, the notifier makes an authorization decision.  A notifier MUST NOT accept a subscription unless 
authorization has been provided by the user.  The means by which authorization are provided are outside the scope of this document. 
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Notifier Generation of NOTIFY requests" anchor="NotifierG">
<t> The SIP Events specification details the formatting and structure of NOTIFY messages. However, packages are mandated to provide 
detailed information on when to send a NOTIFY, how to compute the state of the resource, how to generate neutral or fake state information,
and whether state information is complete or partial.  This section describes those details for the "comm-div-info" event package.
<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
A notifier sends a NOTIFY request when a communication diversion is enacted on behalf of the user. If there is a stored filter criteria for 
the user, then the notifier MUST look into the filter criteria. If the filter criteria
matches, then the notifier generates a NOTIFY request and sends the NOTIFY request to the user. If the filter criteria do not 
match, then the notifier does not generate a NOTIFY request. A body part of the NOTIFY  has a 
content-type set to "application/vnd.3gpp.comm-div-info+xml" and must contain the elements defined in 3GPP TS 24.604 <xref target="3GPP.24.604"></xref>.
<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
Notifiers could detect that a communication diversion was enacted on behalf of the subscriber via a "History-Info" header field <xref target="RFC4244">
</xref> value, per 3GPP TS 24.604 <xref target="3GPP.24.604"></xref>, sent from an application server hosting the CDIV service. 
 </t>
</section>
<section title="Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests">
<t> The SIP Events specification expects event packages to describe the process followed by the subscriber upon receipt of a 
NOTIFY request. In this specification, each NOTIFY request contains a XML document for the content type "application/vnd.3gpp.comm-div-info+xml" (see 3GPP TS 24.604 <xref target="3GPP.24.604"></xref>).
</t>
</section>
<section title="Handling of Forked Requests">
<t> The SIP Events specification requires each package to describe handling of forked Requests. 
<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
This specification only allows a single dialog to be constructed as a result of emitting an initial SUBSCRIBE request. This
guarantees that only a single notifier is generating notifications for a particular subscription to a particular user. 
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
But if forking is allowed, then the server that receives multiple subscriptions should be able to generate a single dialog on behalf of all the
subscriptions that are received. Any subsequent subscriptions should be mapped to the generated dialog. Similarly when the server
receives a single notification for the generated dialog, it should be generate the corresponding number of notifications towards the
received notifications.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Rate of Notifications">
<t>
The SIP Events specification requires each package to specify maximum rate at which notifications can be sent . 
<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
Comm-div-info notifiers SHOULD NOT generate notifications for a single subscription at a rate of more than once every five seconds.
</t>
</section>
<section title="State Agents" anchor="state">
<t>
An FSM associated with the subscriber is created in the "IDLE" state, e.g. upon receiving filter criteria.  Whenever 
a communication diversion is detected for a URI of the subscriber, a state transition occurs.  Depending on whether a 
filter is matched, a state is entered. In the DIVERSION_NOTIFIED state, notification information is sent to the subscriber.  
If notification information needs to be sent, the Notifier generates the notification information and sends the information 
to the subscriber. If a diversion is detected but no filter is matched, a transition to DIVERSION_NOT_NOTIFIED occurs.
<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
The FSM for CDIVN is shown in below Figure.

Authentication and authorization of subscriptions have been discussed

sensitive information with regards to the user's call receiving
patterns.  For example, who calls the user and at what time, etc.  
<vspace blankLines="1"></vspace>
Integrity protection and confidentiality of notifications are also
discussed in <xref target="NotifierG"></xref>.  If a notifier does not encrypt bodies of
NOTIFY requests, an eavesdropper could learn the status of a SIP user
agent and use it to create malicious sessions.  If the notifier
does not integrity protect the bodies of NOTIFY requests, a man-in-
the-middle attacker or malicious SIP proxy could modify the contents
of the comm-div-info event package notification.  Although this does
not cause harm, it can create annoyances. </t>
