Abstract

    After sun-setting of IPv4, many devices are connected to IPv6 single
   stack network. In this document we describe a workaround of IPv6
   enabled network configuration. At this moment, the condition of IPv6
   adoption on the consumer devices such as PC, tablet, mobile terminal
   and entertainment devices are various. For example, some devices are
   fully support IPv6 client but some are not. It is very hard to
   provide IPv6 network service with these various conditioned devices.
   To solve this problem, we tried to verify some configurations to
   connect these devices into IPv6 enabled consumer network for
   termination of IPv4 network services.

INTERNET DRAFT<A workaround for termination of IPv4 network services>October 15, 2012


1  Introduction

    After sun-setting of IPv4, many devices are connected to IPv6 only
   network. In this document we describe a workaround of IPv6 enabled
   network configuration.  At this moment, the condition of IPv6
   adoption on the consumer devices such as PC, tablet, smart phones and
   entertainment devices are various.  For example, some devices are
   fully support DHCPv6 client function but some are not.  In IETF,
   additional function for connecting clients are still discussed.
   Implementation of client function will be changing for a while.  It
   must be very hard to provide IPv6 network service with these various
   conditioned devices.  To solve this issue, we tried to verify some
   configurations to connect these devices into IPv6 enabled consumer
   network.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2  Test Network

   In this document we call "IPv6-only network" as a user network which
   connects IPv6 clients and carries IPv6 packets. We made an IPv6-only
   test network as following configuration. We brought this IPv6-only
   network to seasonal WIDE Camp from 2011 to 2012. WIDE Camp was hold 3
   times. Through DNS64/NAT64 translation, the clients can access IPv4
   Internet services and with this technique the users can turn off IPv4
   at the edge network. We can observe simply IPv6 client behavior and
   solve the specified points. 

   Here is the basic configuration;

   User-Access:   WiFi(IEEE802.11a,b,g,n)
   IPv6 Address Configuration: SLAAC(address prefix,router),DHCPv6(DNS)
   ISP(IPv6):     DHCP-PD or static setting of prefix
   IPv4 Internet: using coexistence 
   mechanism(4rd,464XLAT,SA46T,DNS64/NAT64) over IPv6, base technology
   is DNS64/NAT64
   DNS64/NAT64:   Map all IPv4 on Internet into IPv6                  
   RA:            Enable Other Config (for DHCP6)                      
   DHCPv6:        Distribute DNS64 address                             
   DHCP4:         No DHCPv4 running!

2.  Problems Statement

"IPv6 support" on consumer devices are inconsistent in implementation.
Especially some devices are designed with IPv6 limitation if no IPv4
information provided on the device. The IPv6 network services has to
absorb these differences in some way.

2.1  Device classification

Over 300 devices were brought into every WIDE Camp. We classified their
Device Type, OS, OS version. We determined deference of DHCP6 client
behavior and possible precondition per OS. Table 1 and 2 shows the
result of them. Popular OS on PC was both Windows and MacOS X series.
Various versions were observed. Popular OS on Mobile Phone was both
Android and iOS. Feature phone were also popular but there were no WiFi
function on such feature phone so that they were out of our target. In
Table 1, we listed up auto-address configuration function on each OS.
The last column means the failure occurred case with checked mark if
they got IPv4 local address within 169.254.0.0/16. In Table 2, we picked
up the OS which has no IPv6 friendly User Interface.

2.2 Observation on personal device

5 problematic behaviors are observed.

 (a). failed to set name server(v6) information(WinXP, MacOS SL,
Android)
 (b). failed to input name server(v6) by manual configuration(Android)
 (c). failed to resolve resource record under (a) or (c)
condition(WinXP, MacOS SL, Android)
 (d). "network setting" won't be completed before getting set of IPv4
information(DNS,router,IPv4 Address)(iOS5,Android)
 (e). waiting for IPv4 connection timeout(MacOS)

The causes of problems on consumer devices are sorted by 3 types. First
one is IPv6 implementation issue, which we listed on Table 1. The other
issue is User Interface issue, which we listed on Table 2. The last one
is coming from other layer's function, typical issue is a WiFi
controller which provided by vendor(Lenovo Access Connections) and turn
off IPv4 with the controller setting then the client was able to connect
to IPv6-only network.

3  Workaround

In this document, we focused on the problem which occurred by IPv6
implementation on the clients. 

How do we solve the problematic behavior?  It might be a distant idea
that waiting for all devices fully support IPv6.  We considered to put
additional configuration parameters to comply with improvements.

3.1 trial and result

 To solve (a)to(e) in Section 2.2, we reconsidered network setting and
putting into testbed network step by step.

   (1) DNS64/NAT64 Map all IPv4 on Internet into IPv6
   (2) DHCPv6 for DNS(IPv6) configuration 
   (3) DHCPv4 for IPv4 private address configuration
   (4) DHCPv4 for DNS(IPv4) and Default Router
       (actual packet transfer is prohibited on this router)
   (5) DNS(IPv4) is located local segment
   (6) DNS(IPv4, IPv6) set 'A' filter
   (7) DNS(IPv4, IPv6) always returns 'NODATA' with 'A' query
       (Over both IPv4 and IPv6 transport)
   (8) AAAA queries forward to DNS64 server

Experiment #1:
   With "IPv4 private address assignment via DHCP4 without Default
   Router nor DNS", no issues were solved.  
   - Timeout problem exist on MacOSX.
   - iOS applications are sometimes working,but periodically fails due
   to retrying Wi-Fi connection.

Experiment #2:
   Put BIND9 forwarder on-link and configure DHCP4/6 to use this DNS.
   Configure BIND9 forwarder with: deny-answer-addresses { 0.0.0.0/0; };
   Which direct no IPv4 address answer should be trusted. It returns
   SERVFAIL to resolver.
   - Android is now working: Browser, Twitter, Facebook are OK.
   - iOS is working: but periodically fails due to retrying.
   - MacOS is working: but still encountered fallback timeout.
   - Windows is NOT WORKING: all DNS queries failed due to SERVFAIL.

Experiment #3:
   Hack AAAA filtering code on BIND9 to filter 'A' instead of 'AAAA'
   both on IPv4/IPv6 transport. Put BIND9 above to local link, which is
   configured to forward all queries to DNS64. Configure DHCP4/DHCP6 to
   use the DNS proxy.
   - Windows, MacOS X, iOS, Android is now working.

INTERNET DRAFT<A workaround for termination of IPv4 network services>October 15, 2012


   - Some of applications still failed on IPv6 only, but many are OK:
   IE/Safari/Chrome/Firefox, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, APNS, ...

   After bringing all new additional network configuration, most of all
   clients were able to connect IPv6-only network with zero-
   configuration on the client side.

   This is the technique for IPv6-only network but also can be useful
   for terminating IPv4 network environment at the user network.

3.2 remaining issue

   "Waiting for IPv4 connection timeout on MacOS" is still issued. A
   possible reason for this connection failure during 1-2 minutes after
   WiFi connection established is timing of sending RS(Router
   Solicitation). RS is sent from kernel before Wi-Fi link is
   established. No IPv6 address is obtained until periodical RA(Router
   Advertisement) is received.

   Workaround for this is considered as follows but we were not unable
   to examine it on the camp at this time.

   - shorten RA interval to 5-10 seconds (though it disturb Wi-Fi...)
   - Detect association through AP log and kick RS or RA.

4  Security Considerations

   Possible security threats are same as what pointed out in original
   protocols and technologies.
