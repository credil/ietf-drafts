Currently BGP-4 [BGP-4] requires that when a BGP speaker receives an
OPEN message with one or more unrecognized Optional Parameters, the
speaker must terminate BGP peering. This complicates introduction of
new capabilities in BGP.
 
This document defines new Optional Parameter, called Capabilities,
that is expected to facilitate introduction of new capabilities in
BGP by providing graceful capability advertisement without requiring
that BGP peering be terminated.

This document is a product of the Inter-Domain Routing Working Group
of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
