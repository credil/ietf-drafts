    <abstract>
      <t>In an attempt to reach consensus on a PCP authentication mechanism,
      this document describes requirements for PCP authentication. It is hoped
      this can serve as the basis for a comparison of PCP authentication
      mechanisms.</t>

      <t>This document derives requirements for PCP Authentication from PCP
      deployment scenarios and scope described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base">PCP-base</xref> and other PCP drafts. The
      document focuses on requirements and does not make a suggestion on the
      authentication mechanism to be used to satisfy requirements.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

          <t hangText="REQ-1:">PCP client and server MUST provide client
          authentication. The client could be a host running a PCP client or
          middle box (e.g., NAT) running a PCP Proxy. <list style="symbols">
              <t>The identity details of the client could be used by the PCP
              server to grant access to certain PCP opcodes or PCP options.
              For example GUESTS would not be permitted to use MAP opcode,
              ADMINISTRATOR is only permitted to use THIRD_PARTY option.</t>

              <t>The identity details of the client could be used for
              auditing.</t>
            </list>PCP Authentication MUST also generate message
          authentication key for integrity protection of PCP request and

          <t hangText="REQ-2:">PCP Servers MUST be able to indicate that a
          request will not be processed without authentication.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-3:">If the original PCP request/response was
          authenticated,<list style="letters">
              <t>A client MUST be able to verify the integrity and origin of a

              unsolicited responses.</t>

              previous security association has expired<list style="numbers">
                  <t>The server can continue to use the same SA to protect
                  messages pertaining to that mapping, even if the SA is
                  technically expired.<list style="symbols">
                      <t>Such server notifications will not change state in
                      the PCP client.</t>

                      <t>The notification could be a trigger for the client to
                      re-authenticate. For example, if the server indicates
                      that external IP address/port has changed, the PCP
                      client can then re-authenticate with the server to
                      confirm if the external IP address/port for the mapping
                      has indeed changed.</t>

                  <t>The server can optionally trigger re-authentication with
                  the client.</t>

              <t>If a PCP response does not include integrity related to a
              current security association, then those messages MUST NOT be
              trusted without soliciting an integrity protected version.</t>

          information between the PCP client and PCP server,<list

              MUST evaluate if confidentiality is OPTIONAL or not for new PCP
              opcodes and options introduced.</t>

              <t>PCP authentication SHOULD be immune to passive dictionary
              attacks.</t>

              <t>PCP Authentication MUST ensure that an attacker snooping PCP

          <t hangText="REQ-5:">To ease troubleshooting and ensure fate

          authentication between administrative domains. For example, a PCP
          client may wish to communicate directly to an ISP&rsquo;s PCP
          server, even though the in-home CPE router does not support PCP. In
          this scenario the PCP client needs to directly authenticate with the
          ISP&rsquo;s PCP server.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-7:">PCP client and server MUST be able mutually
          authenticate, especially when the PCP server is located in a
          different administrative domain from the PCP client. Credentials to
          gain access to the network could be different from the credentials
          used to authenticate with the PCP server.</t>

          increase load on the PCP server and chatter on the network. For

    <section title="Third Party Authorization">
      <t>In addition to two party authentication that has been discussed in
      this draft, a mechanism for third party authorization must also be
      supported. This is required in cases where a third party authorizes the
      use of a resource on a PCP server for a desired PCP client. For example,
      a PCP request to a PCP capable firewall authorized by a SIP proxy rather
      than by virtue of the end user making the PCP request. The PCP server is
      to permit a PCP MAP request if a user is making a SIP call with the
      Enterprise SIP server, otherwise do not allow MAP request from that
      particular user. In this scenario the first party is the user, second
      party is the PCP server (which is also the firewall) and the third party
      is the SIP Server, where the user is authorized to use MAP request only
      when making a call using the trusted SIP Server.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Other recommendations">
      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>It is recommended that there be support for a means to provide
          integrity protection without user authentication. For example, upon
          receiving a challenge with a certain REALM, if the PCP client does
          not have credentials for that REALM, the client will attempt to use
          a default username and password. Default credentials are expected to
          be configured on infrastructure where PCP authentication is not
          necessary, but such guest users are given some (minimal)
          authorization to use PCP. This addresses the problem when the client
          is visiting foreign networks like a hotel, hot spot etc where it may
          gain access to the network but does not know the credentials to
          authenticate to the ISP&rsquo;s PCP server when the in-home CPE
          router does not support PCP and the PCP client needs to directly
          authenticate with the ISP&rsquo;s PCP server.</t>
