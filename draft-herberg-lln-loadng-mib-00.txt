  Definition of Managed Objects for the LLN On-demand Ad hoc Distance-
           vector Routing Protocol - Next Generation (LOADng)
                    draft-herberg-lln-loadng-mib-00

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring parameters of the
   LLN On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol - Next
   Generation (LOADng) process on a router.  The MIB module defined in
   this memo, denoted LOADng-MIB, also reports state.  While LOADng is
   layer agnostic and can be run with different address families (e.g.,
   on L2 using MAC addreses, or on L3 using IP addresss), this MIB
   module assumes that LOADng is used on L3, and uses only IPv4/IPv6
   addresses.

Internet-Draft               The LOADng-MIB                    June 2012


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring parameters of the
   LLN On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol - Next
   Generation (LOADng) [LOADng] process on a router.  The MIB module
   defined in this memo, denoted LOADng-MIB, also reports state.  While
   LOADng is layer agnostic and can be run with different address
   families (e.g., on L2 using MAC addreses, or on L3 using IP
   addresss), this MIB module assumes that LOADng is used on L3, and
   uses only IPv4/IPv6 addresses.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB module are defined using the mechanisms defined in
   the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
   [RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The LLN On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol - Next
   Generation (LOADng) [LOADng] is a routing protocol, derived from AODV
   [RFC3561] and extended for use in Low power and Lossy Networks
   (LLNs).  As a reactive protocol, the basic operations of LOADng
   include generation of Route Requests (RREQs) by a router (originator)
   for when discovering a route to a destination, forwarding of such
   RREQs until they reach the destination router, generation of Route
   Replies (RREPs) upon receipt of an RREQ by the indicated destination,
   and unicast hop-by-hop forwarding of these RREPs towards the
   originator.  If a route is detected broken, i.e., if forwarding of a
   data packet to the recorded next hop on the route to the destination
   is detected to fail, a Route Error (RERR) message is returned in

   unicast to the originator of that data packet.

   This MIB module describes objects for configuring parameters of a
   LOADng process on a router, as well as for the relevant state of a
   LOADng process on a router, in order to monitor and manage parameters
   and information bases of LOADng.

4.1.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB module.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the LOADng protocol process in the
      router.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the LOADng-MIB module.  The
   MIB module is arranged into the following structure:

   o  LOADngObjects - defining objects within this MIB module.  The
      objects are arranged into the following groups:

      *  Configuration Group - defining objects related to the
         configuration of the LOADng instance on the router.

      *  State Group - defining objects which reflect the current state
         of the LOADng instance running on the router.

   o  LOADngConformance - defining the minimal and maximal conformance
      requirements for implementations of this MIB module.

5.1.  The Configuration Group

   The LOADng router is configured with a set of controls.  The
   authoritative list of configuration controls within the LOADng-MIB
   module are found within the MIB module itself.  Generally, an attempt
   was made in developing the LOADng-MIB module to support all
   configuration objects defined in [LOADng].  For all of the
   configuration parameters, the same default values of these parameters
   as defined in [LOADng] are followed.

Internet-Draft               The LOADng-MIB                    June 2012


5.2.  The State Group

   The State Group reports current state information of a router running
   [LOADng].  The LOADng-MIB State Group tables were designed to contain
   the complete set of state information defined within the information
   bases specified in Section 6 of [LOADng].

5.3.  Tables and Indexing

   The LOADng-MIB module contains a number of tables which record data
   related to:

   o  the local LOADng router,

   o  a local LOADng interface on the LOADng router,

   o  other LOADng routers in the routing domain.

   The LOADng-MIB module's tables and their indexing are:

   o  loadngInterfaceTable - describes the configuration of the
      interfaces of this LOADng router.  This table has 'INDEX {
      loadngIfIndex }'.

   o  loadngLibLocalIfSetTable - records all network addresses which are
      defined as local interface network addresses on this LOADng
      router.  This table has 'INDEX { loadngLibLocalIfSetIfAddrIndex,
      loadngLibLocalIfSetIfIndex }'.

   o  loadngLibDestAddressSetTable - records addresses, for which a
      LOADng Router will generate RREPs in response to received RREQs,
      in addition to its own interface addresses (as listed in the Local
      Interface Set).  This table has 'INDEX {
      loadngLibDestAddressSetIndex }'.

   o  loadngBlacklistedNeighborSetTable - records the neighbor interface
      addresses of a LOADng Router, with which connectivity has been
      detected to be unidirectional.  This table has 'INDEX {
      loadngBlacklistedNeighborSetIndex }'.

   o  loadngRoutingSetTable - records the next hop on the route to each
      known destination.  This table has 'INDEX { loadngRoutingSetIndex
      }'.

   o  loadngPendingAckSetTable - records information about RREPs which
      have been transmitted with the ackrequired flag set, and for which
      an RREP_ACK has not yet been received.  This table has 'INDEX {
      loadngPendingAckSetIndex }'.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   This section specifies the relationship of the MIB module contained
   in this document to other standards, particularly to standards
   containing other MIB modules.  Definitions imported from other MIB
   modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be implemented in
   conjunction with the MIB module contained within this document are
   identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB module [RFC3418] is defined as
   being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity
   as a whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the
   management entity and certain other system-wide data.  The LOADng-MIB
   module does not duplicate those objects.

6.2.  MIB Modules Required for IMPORTS

   The following LOADng-MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB
   [RFC2863], and INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001].

8.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module defines objects for the configuration and monitoring
   of LOADng [LOADng].

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  loadngNetTraversalTime - this writable object controls the maximum
      time that a packet is expected to take when traversing from one
      end of the network to the other.  If set too low, a router will
      not wait long enough until receiving an RREP as response to an
      RREQ.  Therefore, all route requests may fail and render LOADng
      useless.

   o  loadngRREQRetries - this writable object controls how many RREQs
      may be sent until an RREP must have been receveived or the route
      discovery is considered failed.  If set too low in very lossy
      networks, route discovery may fail for destinations (which
      otherwise would have succeeded, had the value been higher).  If
      set too high, a router may send unnecessary many RREQs, draining
      energy from the router and consuming bandwidth.

   o  loadngRREQRatelimit - this writable object controls how many RREQs
      may be sent per second.  If set too high, a malicous node (host or
      router) may request routes for many destinations, resulting in
      many RREQs, which drain energy from the router and consume
      bandwidth.

Internet-Draft               The LOADng-MIB                    June 2012


   o  loadngRHoldTime - this writable object controls how long a Routing
      Tuple is hold in the Routing Set. If set too low, a router may not
      keep routes long enough, and may therefore frequently rediscover
      the same routes to a destination, resulting in bandwidth
      consumption and energy drain.

   o  loadngRREPAckTimeout - this writable object controls how long a
      router waits before expecting an RREP_ACK.  If set too low, and if
      RREP_ACKs are required, the router may list the neighbor as
      unidirectional and may therefore not use it for routing.

   o  loadngBHoldTime - this writable object controls how long a
      Blacklisted Neighbor Tuples is hold in the Blacklisted Neighbor
      Set. If set too high, a neighbor router may be blocked for a long
      time, even though it may have become reachable bidirectionally in
      the meantime.

   o  loadngRREPAckRequired - this writable object controls whether
      RREP_ACKs are required for verification of bidirectionality.  If
      disabled in a lossy environment, and if bidirectionality is not
      verified by other means, unidirectional routes may be discovered
      to destinations.

   o  loadngMaxRouteCost, loadngMaxWeakLinks - these writable objects
      control the maximum distance of a router in the LLN.  If set too
      low, destinations may be ignored to which otherwise a path could
      be established by LOADng.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  loadngRoutingSetTable - The table contains information on
      destinations in the LLN, specifically their IP address in the
      loadngRoutingSetDestIpAddr object.  This information provides an
      adversary broad information on the members of the LLN, located
      within this single table.  This information can be use to expedite
      attacks on the other members of the LLN without having to go
      through a laborious discovery process on their own.  This object
      is the index into the table, and has a MAX-ACCESS of 'not-
      accessible'.  However, this information can be exposed using SNMP
      operations.

   LLN technology is often deployed to support communications of

   emergency services or military tactical applications.  In these
   applications, it is imperative to maintain the proper operation of
   the communications network and to protect sensitive information
   related to its operation.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED to provide
   support for the Transport Security Model (TSM) [RFC5591] in
   combination with TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementations provide the security features
   described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), including full
   support for authentication and privacy via the User-based Security
   Model (USM) [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
   Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security
   Model (TSM) [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as
   SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): IANA is requested
   to assign a value for "XXXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and to record
   the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the assignment has
   been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXXX" (here and in the
   MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove this note.  Note
   well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document MUST
   use placeholders (such as "XXXX" above) rather than actual numbers.
   See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done in a draft
   MIB module.
