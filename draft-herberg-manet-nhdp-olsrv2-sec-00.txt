      Integrity Protection for Control Messages in NHDP and OLSRv2
                 draft-herberg-manet-nhdp-olsrv2-sec-00

Abstract

   This document specifies integrity and replay protection for required
   implementation in the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)
   and the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).
   This document specifies how an integrity check value (ICV) and a
   timestamp may be included as TLVs (defined in [RFC6622bis]) in NHDP's
   and OLSRv2's control messages, countering a number of security
   threats to NHDP and to OLSRv2.  The ICV TLV uses a SHA-256 based HMAC
   and a single shared secret key.  The timestamp TLV is based on POSIX
   time, assuming router synchronization.  The mechanism in this
   specification can also be used for other MANET protocols using
   RFC5444.

Internet-Draft  Integrity Protection for NHDP and OLSRv2   February 2013


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a framework of security mechanisms that
   must be included in conforming implementations of the mobile ad hoc
   network (MANET) protocols Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)
   [RFC6130] and the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2
   (OLSRv2) [OLSRv2].  A deployment of these protocols may however
   choose to employ alternative(s) to these mechanisms, in particular it
   may choose to protect packets rather than messages, it may choose to
   use an alternative integrity check value (ICV) with preferred
   properties, or it may use an alternative timestamp.  A deployment may
   choose to use no such security mechanisms, but this is not
   recommended.

   The mechanisms specified are the use of an ICV for protection of the
   protocols' control messages, and the use of timestamps in those
   messages to prevent replay attacks.  Both use the TLV mechanism
   specified in [RFC5444] to add this information to the messages.
   These ICV and timestamp TLVs are defined in [RFC6622bis].  Different
   ICV TLVs are used for HELLO messages in NHDP and TC messages in
   OLSRv2, the former also protecting the source address of the IP
   datagram that contains the HELLO message, because the IP datagram
   source address is used by NHDP to determine the address of a neighbor
   interface, and is not necessarily otherwise contained in the HELLO
   message.

   The mechanism specified in this document must insert itself between
   NHDP's and OLSRv2's message processing/generation and the [RFC5444]
   packet parsing/generation, as illustrated in Figure 1.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses the terminology of [RFC5444],
   [RFC6130], [OLSRv2], and [RFC6622bis].


3.  Applicability Statement

   [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] enable extensions to recognize additional
   reasons for rejecting a message as "badly formed and therefore



Clausen, et al.          Expires August 22, 2013                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  Integrity Protection for NHDP and OLSRv2   February 2013


   invalid for processing", and mention security as an explicit example.

   This framework's applicability to provide that functionality is
   determined by its characteristics, which are that it:

   o  Specifies a security framework that is required to be included in
      conforming implementations of [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2].

   o  Specifies an association of ICVs with messages, and for using
      missing or invalid ICVs as such an "additional reason" for
      rejecting a message as "badly formed and therefore invalid for
      processing".

   o  Specifies ICV TLVs, defined in [RFC6622bis], using a SHA-256 based
      HMAC applied to the appropriate message contents (and for HELLO
      messages also including the IP datagram source address) to
      implement the required association.

   o  Specifies a TIMESTAMP TLV, defined in [RFC6622bis], to provide
      message replay protection.

   o  Assumes that a router which is able to generate correct integrity
      checks is considered trusted.

   This framework does NOT:

   o  Specify how to distribute cryptographic material (shared secret
      key).

   o  Specify how to detect compromised routers with valid keys.

   o  Specify how to handle (revoke) compromised routers with valid
      keys.


4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning

   The framework specified in this document provides the following
   functionalities that may be used in the messages owned by [RFC6130]
   and [OLSRv2]:

   o  Generation of an ICV TLV (as defined in [RFC6622bis]) for
      inclusion in an outgoing message.

   o  Generation of a TIMESTAMP TLV (as defined in [RFC6622bis]) for
      inclusion in an outgoing message.





Clausen, et al.          Expires August 22, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  Integrity Protection for NHDP and OLSRv2   February 2013


   o  Verification of an ICV TLV contained in a message, in order to
      determine if this message MUST be rejected as "badly formed and
      therefore invalid for processing" [RFC6130] [OLSRv2].

   o  Verification of a TIMESTAMP TLV (as defined in [RFC6622bis])
      contained in a message, in order to determine if this message MUST
      be rejected as "badly formed and therefore invalid for processing"
      [RFC6130] [OLSRv2].

   Specific cases of the ICV and TIMESTAMP TLVs that MUST be implemented
   in conforming implementations of NHDP and OLSRv2 are specified in
   this document, referenced from [RFC6622bis].

   ICV Packet TLVs may be used by a deployment of the multiplexing
   process defined in [RFC5444], either as well as, or instead of, the
   protection of the NHDP and OLSRv2 messages.  (Note that in the case
   of NHDP, the packet protection is equally good, and also protects the
   packet header.  In the case of OLSRv2, the packet protection has
   different properties than the message protection, especially for some
   possible forms of ICV.  When packets contain more than one message,
   the packet protection has lower overheads in space and computation
   time.)

   When a router generates a message on a MANET interface, this
   framework:

   o  Specifies how to calculate an integrity check value for the
      message.

   o  Specifies how to include that integrity check value using an ICV
      Message TLV.

   The ICV algorithm whose implementation is REQUIRED by this framework
   is an HMAC [RFC2104] using the SHA-256 hash function [RFC4634] and a
   single secret key shared by all routers.

   [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] allow for rejecting incoming messages prior to
   processing by NHDP or OLSRv2.  This framework specifies that a
   message MUST be rejected if the ICV Message TLV is absent, or its
   value cannot be verified.


5.  Parameters

   This following router parameters is specified for use by the two
   protocols; the first is required only by NHDP, but may be visible to
   OLSRv2, the second is required only by OLSRv2:




Clausen, et al.          Expires August 22, 2013                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  Integrity Protection for NHDP and OLSRv2   February 2013


   o  MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF - The maximum age that a HELLO message to
      be validated may have.  If the current POSIX time of the router
      validating the HELLO message, minus the timestamp indicated in the
      TIMESTAMP TLV of the HELLO message, is greater than
      MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF, the HELLO message MUST be silently
      discarded.

   o  MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF - The maximum age that a TC message to be
      validated may have.  If the current POSIX time of the router
      validating the TC message, minus the timestamp indicated in the
      TIMESTAMP TLV of the TC message, is greater than
      MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF, the TC message MUST be silently discarded.

   The following constraints apply to these parameters:

   o  MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF > 0

   o  MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF < REFRESH_INTERVAL

   o  MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF > 0

   o  MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF < T_HOLD_TIME

   The second and fourth of those constraints assume ideal
   synchronization.  These bounds MAY be relaxed to allow for expected
   timing differences between routers (between neighboring routers for
   MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF).  However it should also be noted that, in
   the ideal case, the parameters SHOULD be significantly less than
   those bounds.


6.  Message Generation and Processing

   This section specifies the modifications how messages are generated
   and processed in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] when using this framework.

6.1.  Message Content

   Messages MUST have the content specified in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2]
   respectively.  In addition, in order to conform to this
   specification, each message MUST contain:

   o  One ICV Message TLV (as specified in [RFC6622bis]), generated
      according to Section 6.2, with:

      *  For TC messages:





Clausen, et al.          Expires August 22, 2013                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  Integrity Protection for NHDP and OLSRv2   February 2013


         +  type-extension := 1

      *  For HELLO messages:

         +  type-extension := 2

      *  hash-function := 3 (SHA-256)

      *  cryptographic-function := 3 (HMAC)

   o  One TIMESTAMP TLV (as specified in [RFC6622bis]), with:

      *  type-extension := 1

6.2.  Message Generation

   After message generation (Section 11.1 of [RFC6130] and Section 16.1.
   of [OLSRv2]) and before message transmission (Section 11.2 of
   [RFC6130] and Section 16.2 of [OLSRv2]), the additional TLVs
   specified in Section 6.1 MUST (unless already present) be added to an
   outgoing message when using this framework.

   The following processing steps MUST be performed in this case:

   1.  <msg-hop-count> and <msg-hop-limit>, if present, are temporarily
       set to 0.

   2.  A TLV of type TIMESTAMP, as specified in Section 6.1, is added to
       the Message TLV block.  The message size is updated accordingly.

   3.  A TLV of type ICV, as specified in [RFC6622bis], is added to the
       Message TLV block.  The message size is updated accordingly.

   4.  <msg-hop-count> and <msg-hop-limit>, if present, are restored to
       their previous values.

6.3.  Message Processing

   Both [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] specify that:

      "On receiving a ... message, a router MUST first check if the
      message is invalid for processing by this router"

   [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] proceed to give a number of conditions that,
   each, will lead to a rejection of the message as "badly formed and
   therefore invalid for processing".  This document adds the following
   conditions to that list, each of which, if true, MUST cause NHDP or
   OLSRv2 (as appropriate) to consider the message as invalid for



Clausen, et al.          Expires August 22, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft  Integrity Protection for NHDP and OLSRv2   February 2013


   processing when using this framework:

   o  The Message TLV block of the message does not contain exactly one
      TIMESTAMP TLV and exactly one ICV TLV, each with the type
      extension, and in the former case hash function and cryptographic
      function, specified in Section 6.1.  (The message may contain
      additional ICV and/or TIMESTAMP TLVs, but with different
      parameters.)

   o  Validation of the ICV TLV in the Message TLV block of the message
      fails, according to Section 6.3.1.

   o  Validation of the TIMESTAMP TLV in the Message TLV block of the
      message fails, according to Section 6.3.2.

6.3.1.  Invalidating a Message Based on Integrity Check

   Consider the ICV Message TLV identified as described in Section 6.2:

   1.  The identified ICV Message TLV is removed from the message, and
       the message size is updated accordingly.

   2.  The message's <msg-hop-count> and <msg-hop-limit> fields are
       temporarily set to 0.

   3.  Calculate the integrity check value for the parameters specified
       in Section 6.1, as specified in [RFC6622bis].

   4.  If this message check value differs from the value of <ICV-data>
       in the ICV Message TLV, then the message validation fails.

   5.  Otherwise, the message validation succeeds.  The message's <msg-
       hop-count> and <msg-hop-limit> fields are restored to their
       previous value, and if required (as it MUST be if the message is
       forwarded) the ICV Message TLV is returned to the message, whose
       size is updated accordingly.  (Alternatively, the original
       received message may be used.)

6.3.2.  Invalidating a Message Based on Timestamp

   Consider the TIMESTAMP Message TLV identified as described in
   Section 6.2:

   1.  If the current POSIX time minus the value of that TIMESTAMP TLV
       is greater than MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF (for a HELLO message) or
       MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF (for a TC message) then the message
       validation fails.

Internet-Draft  Integrity Protection for NHDP and OLSRv2   February 2013


   2.  Otherwise the message validation succeeds.


7.  Provisioning of Routers

   Before a router is able to generate ICVs or validate messages, it
   MUST acquire the single shared secret key that is to be used by all
   routers that are to participate in the network.  This specification
   does not define how a router acquires this secret key.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


9.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a security framework for use with NHDP and
   OLSRv2 that allows for alleviating several security threats.

9.1.  Alleviated Attacks

   This section briefly summarizes security threats that are alleviated
   by the framework presented in this document.

9.1.1.  Identity Spoofing

   As only routers possessing the shared secret key are able to add a
   valid ICV TLV to a message, identity spoofing is countered.

9.1.2.  Link Spoofing

   Link spoofing is countered by the framework specified in this
   document, using the same argument as in Section 9.1.1.

9.1.3.  Replay Attack

   Replay attacks are partly counteracted by the framework specified in
   this document, but this depends on synchronized clocks of all routers
   in the MANET.  An attacker that records messages to replay them later
   can only do so in the selected time interval after the timestamp that
   is contained in message.  As an attacker cannot modify the content of
   this timestamp (as it is protected by the identity check value), an
   attacker cannot replay messages after this time.  Within this time
   interval it is still possible to perform replay attacks, however the
   limits on the time interval are specified so that this will have a
   limited effect on the operation of the protocol.

Internet-Draft  Integrity Protection for NHDP and OLSRv2   February 2013


9.2.  Limitations

   If no synchronized clocks are available in the MANET, replay attacks
   cannot be countered by the framework provided by this document.  An
   alternative version of the TIMESTAMP TLV defined in [RFC6622bis],
   with a monotonic sequence number, may have some partial value in this
   case, but will necessitate adding state to record observed message
   sequence number information.

   The framework provided by this document does not avoid or detect
   security attacks by routers possessing the shared secret key that is
   used to generate integrity check values for messages.

   This framework relies on an out-of-band protocol or mechanism for
   distributing the shared secret key (and if an alternative integrity
   check value is used, any additional cryptographic parameters).

   This framework does not provide a key revocation mechanism.
