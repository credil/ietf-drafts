  Attribute-Value Pairs For Provisioning Customer Equipment Supporting
                 IPv4-Over-IPv6 Transitional Solutions
                 draft-zhou-dime-4over6-provisioning-02

Abstract

   During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, customer equipment may have
   to support one of the various transition methods that have been or
   are currently being defined for carrying IPv4 packets over IPv6.
   Work is currently in progress to enumerate the information that needs
   to be provisioned on a customer edge router to support a list of
   transition techniques based on tunneling IPv4 in IPv6, with a view to
   defining reusable components for a reasonable transition path between
   these techniques.  To the extent that the provisioning is done
   dynamically, AAA support is needed to provide the information to the
   network server responsible for passing the information to the
   customer equipment.  This document specifies Diameter attribute-value
   pairs to be used for that purpose.

Internet-Draft      AVPs For 4over6 CPE Provisioning        October 2013


1.  Introduction

   A number of transition technologies have been or are being defined to
   allow IPv4 packets to pass between hosts and IPv4 networks over an
   intervening IPv6 network while minimizing the number of public IPv4
   addresses that need to be consumed by the hosts.  Different operators
   will deploy different technologies, and sometimes one operator will
   use more than one technology, depending on what is supported by the
   available equipment and upon other factors both technical and
   economic.

   Each technique requires the provisioning of some subscriber-specific
   information on the customer edge device.  The provisioning may be by
   DHCP or by some other method.  This document is indifferent to the
   specific provisioning technique used, but assumes that the
   information originates in the AAA infrastructure because in some
   networks, the user configuration information may be managed by AAA
   (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) servers.  In a fixed
   line broadband network, the Broadband Network Gateways (BNGs) act as
   the access gateway of users.  When the BR and BNG are co-located in
   one device, the approach defined in [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-radius]
   could be used to acquire the subscriber-specific information via
   RADIUS.  In some deployments when the location of the BR is higher
   than BNG, the subscriber-specific information will be pushed from AAA
   server to the BR actively via Diameter [RFC6733].  To allow the
   information to be carried in Diameter , this document specifies a
   number of attribute-value pairs (AVPs) for the purpose.

   This document takes as its scope the set of transition methods
   provided for by [I-D.ietf-softwire-unified-cpe].  That document
   enumerates the information that must be provisioned in the customer
   edge router to support Dual-Stack Lite [RFC6333], Public IPv4 Over
   IPv6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6], Light Weight IPv4 Over IPv6
   (LW4o6) [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6], and Mapping of Address and Port
   with Encapsulation (MAP-E) [I-D.ietf-softwire-map].

   Several documents provide related specifications for RADIUS
   [RFC2865], for individual transition methods.  Potentially there
   could be a reconciliation between the contents of those documents and
   the present one, but that has not been done in the present version of
   this document.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Description of the Parameters Required By Each Transition Method

   This section reviews the parameters that need to be provisioned for
   each of the transition methods listed above.  This enumeration
   provides the justification for the AVPs defined in the next section.
   Since most of the transition methods dealt with here are works in
   progress, this section is subject to modification in future versions.

   A means is required to indicate which transition method(s) a given
   subscriber is allowed to use.  [I-D.ietf-softwire-unified-cpe]
   specifies how to infer the intended method from other DHCP parameters
   received.  The approach taken in this document is to specify grouped
   AVPs specific to the individual transition methods.  The operator can
   control which transition method a given subscriber uses by ensuring
   that AAA passes only the grouped AVP relevant to that method.

2.1.  Parameters For Dual-Stack Lite

   Dual-Stack Lite is documented in [RFC6333].  It requires the
   following parameters to be provisioned at the B4 at the customer
   premises.  This enumeration does not include the normal provisioning
   of an IPv6 prefix to the customer equipment.  The section numbers
   shown are where these requirements are indicated in [RFC6333].

   o  IPv6 address of the border router (AFTR) (sec. 5.4);

   o  IPv6 address of a DNS recursive server (sec. 5.5).  This is
      probably supplied already independently of transition technology,
      so does not have to be covered here.

   o  optionally, the IPv4 address of the B4 interface facing the
      tunnel, where the default value in the absence of provisioning is
      192.0.0.2 and valid values are 192.0.0.2 through 192.0.0.7 (sec.
      5.7).  Provisioning this information through AAA is problematic
      because it is most likely used in a case where multiple B4
      instances occupy the same device.  This document therefore assumes
      that the B4 interface address is determined by other means
      (implementation- dependent or static assignment).

2.2.  Public IPv4 Over IPv6

   Public IPv4 Over IPv6 is described in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6].  Besides the usual IPv6 prefix or
   address information, it requires two parameters to be provisioned to
   the customer equipment:

   o  a public IPv4 address;




Zhou, et al.             Expires April 21, 2014                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      AVPs For 4over6 CPE Provisioning        October 2013


   o  IPv6 address of the border router

   It also requires per-subscriber provisioning on the border router:

   o  binding between the customer IPv4 address and the customer IPv6
      prefix, for routing of incoming packets to the correct tunnel.

2.3.  Light Weight IPv4 Over IPv6 (LW4o6)

   Light Weight IPv4 Over IPv6 (LW4o6) is documented in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6].  Its provisioning requirements are
   exactly the same as those for Public 4over6 with one addition:

   o  both the customer equipment and the border router are provided
      with a port set identifier identifying the set of ports to which
      the subscriber's incoming and outgoing packets on the public side
      are restricted.  The port selection algorithm and port set
      identifier as such are not discussed in the draft.  For the
      present version of this document, it is assumed that the algorithm
      is known in advance and the port set identifier has the form of an
      index ranging from zero to the number of subscribers sharing a
      given address less 1.  This is similar to the port set identifier
      in MAP-E, described next.

2.4.  Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)

   Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E) is described
   in [I-D.ietf-softwire-map].  MAP-E requires the provisioning of the
   following per-subscriber information at the customer edge device:

   o  whether the device is to operate in mesh or hub-and-spoke mode;

   o  the IPv6 address of one or more border routers;

   o  the specially constructed End-user IPv6 prefix for the customer
      edge device.  [I-D.ietf-softwire-map] suggests that this would be
      supplied as part of normal IPv6 provisioning, so it can be ignored
      as a requirement here.

   o  the Basic Mapping Rule for the customer edge device.  This
      includes the following parameters:

      *  the rule IPv6 prefix and length;

      *  the rule IPv4 prefix and length;

      *  the number of "Extended Address" (EA) bits included in the End-
         user IPv6 prefix;



Zhou, et al.             Expires April 21, 2014                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      AVPs For 4over6 CPE Provisioning        October 2013


      *  of those Extended Address bits, the number that precede the
         port set identifier.  The default value is 6.

   o  in mesh mode only, zero or more Forwarding Mapping Rules,
      containing the same parameters as the Basic Mapping rule.

   o  optionally, the port set identifier if the EA bits do not carry
      it.

   The border router needs to be configured with the superset of the
   Forwarding MAP Rules passed to the customer sites it serves.  Since
   this is not subscriber-specific, even though it introduces no new
   requirements to this document, it is out of scope.

2.5.  Summing Up

   It appears that the following items are common to two or more methods
   and the corresponding AVPs to carry them can be reused:

   o  the IPv6 address of the border router;

   o  an IPv4 prefix and length (could be a /32);

   o  a port set identifier.

   The remaining requirements are method-specific:

   o  for Public 4over6 and LW4o6, a binding between a customer IPv6
      prefix or address and an IPv4 address;

   o  for MAP-E, the indication of whether mesh mode or hub-and-spoke
      mode is to be used;

   o  for MAP-E, a Grouped AVP expressing a MAP Rule.

3.  Attribute-Value Pair Definitions

   This section provides the specifications for the AVPs needed to meet
   the requirements summarized in Section 2.5.  Within the context of
   their usage, all of these AVPs MUST have the M bit set and the V bit
   cleared.

3.1.  DS-Lite Attributes

   The DS-Lite-Attributes AVP is of type Grouped.  It contains the IPv6
   address of the AFTR and optionally the multicast-related prefixes
   needed for providing native IPv4 multicast over IPv6 using DS-Lite,
   as specified in [I-D.softwire-dslite-multicast].

                 DS-Lite-Attributes  ::= < AVP Header: TBD01 >
                          { Border-Router-IPv6-Address }
                       0*1[ ASM-Prefix64 ]
                       0*1[ SSM-Prefix64 ]
                       0*1[ Unicast-Prefix64 ]
                         *[ AVP ]

                                 Figure 1

   The Border-Router-IPv6-Address AVP is defined in Section 3.6.  Within
   the DS-Lite-Attributes AVP, it provides the IPv6 address of the AFTR.
   This AVP MUST be present.

   The remaining AVPs are defined in this section, and MAY be included
   if the subscriber is to receive native IPv4 multicast service over
   IPv6 using DS-Lite.  If either ASM-Prefix64 or SSM-Prefix64 or both
   are present, Unicast-Prefix64 MUST also be present.

3.1.1.  ASM-Prefix64

   The ASM-Prefix64 AVP (AVP Code TBD02) is derived from base type
   OctetString.  It is a discriminated union representing the
   combination of the prefix length (number of bits) in the first octet,
   followed by the prefix itself, most significant octet first, padded
   with zeroes at the low-order end to an octet boundary.  Valid values
   of the prefix length are from 0 to 96, where 0 indicates that the
   prefix is absent.

   This AVP conveys the IPv6 multicast prefix to be used to synthesize
   the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of the multicast groups in the Any-
   Source Multicast (ASM) mode.  The conveyed multicast IPv6 prefix MUST
   belong to the ASM range.

3.1.2.  SSM-Prefix64

   The SSM-Prefix64 AVP (AVP Code TBD03) is derived from base type
   OctetString.  It is a discriminated union representing the
   combination of the prefix length (number of bits) in the first octet,
   followed by the prefix itself, most significant octet first, padded
   with zeroes at the low-order end to an octet boundary.  Valid values
   of the prefix length are 0 and 96, where 0 indicates that the prefix
   is absent.

   This AVP conveys the IPv6 multicast prefix to be used to synthesize
   the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of the multicast groups in the
   Source-Specific Multicast [RFC4607] mode.  The conveyed multicast
   IPv6 prefix MUST belong to the SSM range.  This prefix is likely to
   be a /96.

3.1.3.  Unicast-Prefix64

   The Unicast-Prefix64 AVP (AVP Code TBD04) is derived from base type
   OctetString.  It is a discriminated union representing the
   combination of the prefix length (number of bits) in the first octet,
   followed by the prefix itself, most significant octet first, padded
   with zeroes at the low-order end to an octet boundary.  Valid values
   of the prefix length are 0, 32, 48, 56, 64 and 96, where 0 indicates
   that the prefix is absent.

   This AVP conveys the IPv6 unicast prefix to be used in SSM mode for
   constructing the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses representing the IPv4
   multicast sources in the IPv6 domain.

   Unicast-Prefix64 may also be used to extract the IPv4 address from
   the received multicast data flows.  The address mapping must follow
   the guidelines documented in [RFC6052].

3.2.  Public Unshared IPv4 Address

   The Public-Unshared-IPv4-Address AVP (AVP Code TBD05) is of type
   Address as defined in Section 4.3 of [RFC6733].  It provides an
   unshared IPv4 address assigned to the customer edge device.  It
   applies to Public 4over6 (always) and to LW4o6 and MAP-E in the case
   of 1-1 mapping.  The recipient of this AVP can determine which of the
   transition methods is applicable from the presence or absence of
   LW4o6-specific or MAP-E-specific additional attributes.  Since the
   content is an IPv4 address, the AVP Length MUST be set to 14 and the
   first two octets MUST contain 0x0001 (IPv4).

3.3.  Light-Weight 4over6 Attributes

   The Light-Weight-4over6-Attributes AVP (AVP Code TBD06) is of type
   Grouped.  It contains the IPv6 address of the Border Router,
   optionally the IPv6 prefix assigned to the customer edge device, and
   optionally the port set identifier assigned to the customer edge
   device.

                 Light-Weight-4over6-Attributes  ::= < AVP Header: TBD06 >
                          { Border-Router-IPv6-Address }
                       0*1[ IPv6-Prefix-Or-Addr ]
                       0*1[ Port-Set-Identifier ]
                         *[ AVP ]

Internet-Draft      AVPs For 4over6 CPE Provisioning        October 2013


   The Border-Router-IPv6-Address AVP is defined in Section 3.6 and
   provides the IPv6 address of the Border Router.  This AVP MUST be
   present.

   The IPv6-Prefix-Or-Addr AVP is defined in Section 3.8.  Within the
   Light-Weight-4over6-Attributes AVP, it provides the IPv6 prefix
   assigned to the customer edge device.  If this AVP is absent, it is
   assumed that the same information is conveyed to the recipient of the
   Light-Weight-4over6-Attributes AVP by another AVP in the subscriber
   profile.

   The Port-Set-Identifier AVP is defined in Section 3.9.  It identifies
   the specific set of ports assigned to the customer edge device.  This
   AVP MUST be present except when 1-1 mapping mode is being
   provisioned, when it MUST NOT be present.  In this version of this
   document it is assumed that the algorithm and parameters used to
   derive individual port values from the port set identifier are
   already known to the recipient.

3.4.  MAP-E Attributes

   The MAP-E-Attributes AVP (AVP Code TBD07) is of type Grouped.  It
   contains the addresses of one or more Border Routers in the same
   MAP-E domain as the customer edge device, an indicator of whether
   mesh mode or hub-and-spoke mode is used in the domain, optionally the

   more mapping rules.

   same information is conveyed to the recipient of the MAP-E-Attributes
   AVP by another AVP in the subscriber profile.

   The Mapping-Rule AVP is defined in Section 3.5.  At least one
   instance of this AVP MUST be present.  If the MAP-E domain supports
   mesh mode, additional Mapping-Rule instances MAY be present.  If the
   MAP-E domain is operating in hub-and-spoke mode, additional Mapping-
   Rule instances MUST NOT be present.

3.5.  Mapping Rule

   The Mapping-Rule AVP (AVP Code TBD08) is of type Grouped, and is used
   only in conjunction with MAP-based transition methods (MAP-E and
   potentially 4rd and MAP-T).  Mapping rules are required both by the
   Border Router and by the customer edge device.  The components of the
   Mapping-Rule AVP are the rule IPv4 prefix or address, the rule IPv6
   prefix, the length in bits of the Extended Address field in the End-
   User IPv6 Prefix assigned to the customer edge device, and optionally
   the offset in a port number beyond which the port set identifier
   begins.

   The syntax of the Mapping-Rule AVP is as follows:

         Mapping-Rule  ::= < AVP Header: TBD08 >
                          { IPv4-Prefix-Or-Addr }
                          { IPv6-Prefix-Or-Addr }
                          { EA-Field-Length     }
                          [ PSID-Offset         ]
                         *[ AVP ]

                                 Figure 4

   The IPv4-Prefix-Or-Addr AVP and IPv6-Prefix-Or-Addr AVPs are defined
   in sections Section 3.7 and Section 3.8 respectively.  They MUST be
   present within the Mapping-Rule AVP.  The EA-Field-Length AVP and
   PSID-Offset AVP are defined in this section.

3.5.1.  EA Field Length

   The EA-Field-Length AVP (AVP Code TBD09) is of type Unsigned32.  The
   valid range for EA-Field-Length extends from 0 to a maximum value
   defined by [I-D.ietf-softwire-map].  If EA-Field-Length is 0, the
   subscriber profile MUST also provide an instance of the Public-
   Unshared-IPv4-Address AVP (AVP Code TBD05).  The EA-Field-Length AVP
   MUST be present within the Mapping-Rule AVP.  AVP Length for the EA-
   Field-Length AVP MUST be set to 12.

3.5.2.  PSID Offset

   The PSID-Offset AVP (AVP Code TBD10) is of type Unsigned32.  The
   valid range for PSID-Offset extends from 0 to 15, with a default
   value given by [I-D.ietf-softwire-map] if the parameter is absent.
   AVP Length for the PSID-Offset AVP MUST be set to 12.

3.6.  Border Router IPv6 Address

   The Border-Router-IPv6-Address (AVP Code TBD11) is of type Address as
   defined in Section 4.3 of [RFC6733] and contains the IPv6 address of
   a border router supporting an IPv6 transition method which will be
   used by the customer edge device on which this address is
   provisioned.  The address MAY be an anycast address.  Since the
   content is an IPv6 address, the AVP Length MUST be set to 26 and the
   first two octets MUST contain 0x0002 (IPv6).

3.7.  IPv4 Prefix or Address

   The IPv4-Prefix-Or-Addr (AVP Code TBD12) is derived from base type
   OctetString.  It is a discriminated union representing the
   combination of the prefix length (number of bits) in the first octet,
   followed by the prefix itself, most significant octet first, padded
   with zeroes at the low-order end to an octet boundary.  Valid values
   of the prefix length are from 0 to 32, where 0 indicates that the
   prefix is absent and 32 indicates a complete address.
   Correspondingly, the AVP Length can range from 9 to 14.

3.8.  IPv6 Prefix or Address

   The IPv6-Prefix-Or-Addr (AVP Code TBD13) is derived from base type
   OctetString.  It is a discriminated union representing the
   combination of the prefix length (number of bits) in the first two
   octets, followed by the prefix itself, most significant octet first,
   padded with zeroes at the low-order end to an octet boundary.  Valid
   values of the prefix length are from 0 to 128, where 0 indicates that
   the prefix is absent and 128 indicates a complete address.
   Correspondingly, the AVP Length can range from 10 to 26.

3.9.  Port Set Identifier

   The Port-Set-Identifier AVP (AVP Code TBD14) is of type Unsigned32
   and indicates a set of ports defined by an otherwise-specified
   algorithm.  For a given shared address, each Port-Set-Identifier
   value MUST identify a separate set of ports.  AVP Length for the
   Port-Set-Identifier AVP MUST be set to 12.

Internet-Draft      AVPs For 4over6 CPE Provisioning        October 2013


3.10.  Mesh Or Hub And Spoke

   The Mesh-Or-Hub-And-Spoke AVP (AVP Code TBD15) is of type Enumerated.
   It indicates whether the MAP-E domain operates in mesh or hub-and-
   spoke mode.  The possible values are:

      (1) mesh mode;

      (2) hub-and-spoke mode.
