             Signaling Color Label Switched Paths Using LDP
                  draft-alvarez-mpls-ldp-color-lsp-00

Abstract

   This document describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol
   (LDP) to signal a switching preference in the presence of multiple
   paths.  A label switched router (LSR) can associate locally a color
   with one or more downstream paths or links, and signal a label path
   per color to upstream LSRs.  Based on local policy, LSRs can select
   between these color LSPs to implement a forwarding preference on a
   downstream LSR.  An egress LSR may influence the signaling decision
   of other LSRs by signaling interest in specific colors.

1.  Introduction

   The extensions in this document allow LSRs to implement a forwarding
   preference between different paths available to downstream LSRs.
   While multiple paths between two LSR may have the same cost from an
   routing perspective, individual paths may have intrinsic
   characteristics that an LSR may prefer.  As an example, some paths
   may have a significant difference in terms of latency, reliability,
   protection, bandwidth or path diversity among other characteristics.
   An LSR may want to allow upstream LSRs to determine what traffic is
   forwarded down specific paths.

Internet-Draft           LDP Color LSP Signaling               July 2013


   A sample deployment scenario for color LSPs involves an LDP network
   using targeted LDP over RSVP-TE LSPs.  A given head-end provider (P)
   device can establish multiple TE LSPs to another tail-end P device.
   One TE LSP can be engineered for low latency while the other TE LSPs
   can be engineered for high bandwidth.  The head-end P device can
   associate locally the low-latency TE LSP with one color and the other
   TE LSPs with a second color.  This device can signal two paths (one
   per color) to upstream LDP peers.  With these two paths, a provider
   edge (PE) device can implement local policies to implement a
   forwarding preference for low latency or high bandwidth at the
   downstream P device.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Applicability of Colors to FEC Elements

   A color LSP can be defined for the following types of LDP FEC
   elements:

      Prefix (0x2)

      P2MP (0x6)

      MP2MP upstream (0x7)

      MP2MP downstream (0x8)

   and for the following address families:

      IP (version 4) (0x1)

      IPv6 (0x2)

3.  Establishing Color LSPs

   Three LSR roles can be involved in establishing a color LSP:

   Color LSR:
      A transit node with multiple paths towards a destination.  It
      advertises color paths to other upstream LSRs according to a local
      forwarding association between colors and downstream paths.
      Advertisement may occur as response to an egress LSR interest in
      specific color paths.

   Ingress LSR:
      Selects between color paths associated with a given FEC to
      influence the forwarding by downstream color LSRs.

   Egress LSR:
      May signal interest in particular colors towards upstream LSRs in
      order to influence the signaling behavior of color LSRs.

   Figure 1 illustrates an example of a network implemententing a
   forwarding preference policy for a prefix FEC.  In this example, LSRa
   is an ingress LSR, LSRb is a color LSR and LSRc is an egress LSR.
   There are three paths (P1, P2 and P3) between LSRb and LSRc.  Path P1
   and P2 have unique characteristics with respect to p3.  LSRb
   associates P1 and P2 with a color value C1, and P3 with a different
   color value C2.  This color-to-path association is a local decision
   on LSRb, and colors are globally significant within the LDP domain.

                                         P1
                                       ------
                                      /      \
                                     /   P2   \
                          LSRa --- LSRb ---- LSRc
                                     \        /
                                      \      /
                                       ------
                                         P3


                      Example of a color LSP scenario

                                 Figure 1

   LSRb signals two color LSPs towards LSRa in response to LSRc interest
   in color LSPs.  LSRc advertises a label for a prefix for which it is
   an egress LSR.  The advertisement includes a label mapping for the
   prefix and a list of colors (C1 and C2) in which LSRc is interested.
   LSRb matches the colors in the local color-path association with the
   color list that LSRc advertised.  After finding a match for both C1
   and C2, LSRb signals labels for two paths towards LSRa with colors C1
   and C2.  In addition, it programs an MPLS forwarding entry that
   associates color C1 with P1 and P2 as next hops, and color label C2
   with P3 as next hop for the prefix advertised by LSRc.  Ultimately,
   LSRa receives two label mappings for the prefix, one associated with
   C1 and the second one associated with C2.

   LSRa can make a local decision to forward traffic towards LSRc using
   the LSP with color C1 (via paths P1 and P2) or the LSP with color C2
   (via P3).  While both color paths overlap between LSRa and LSRb, the

   latter differentiates the forwarding of color labels towards LSRc per
   its local policy.

   LSRb may implement different policies for the signaling of color
   LSPs.  In the scenario above, LSRb can be provisioned to advertise
   color labels for C1 and and C2 without requiring explicit indication
   from LSRc of interest in those two colors.  Such configuration may be
   desirable for interoperability with legacy egress LSRs that cannot
   signal a color interest.  It may also be desirable in deployment
   scenarios where color LSPs should be signaled for all egress LSRs and
   there is no need to provide control for individual egress LSRs.

4.  LDP Color LSP Capability

   This new capability parameter allows an LSR to advertise its ability
   to signal a color LSP for a given FEC type (Section 2).  The
   capability follows the format and procedures defined in [RFC5561] and
   may be signaled in LDP Initialization or Capability messages.

   Reserved:
      Must be set to zero on transmission and ignored on receipt

   Color LSP Capability Data:
      This is capability-specific data that is defined for Color LSPs.
      It consists of a Typed Wildcard FEC Element [RFC5918] identifying
      the FEC for which this capability is being signaled.  In the
      context of this document, the Typed Wildcard FEC element MUST
      correspond to one of the FEC types applicable to Color LSP as
      defined in Section 2.  If a receiver receives this TLV with a
      Typed Wildcard FEC of type other than those defined in Section 2,
      it SHOULD silently discard the TLV and continue processing rest of
      the message.

   In order to announce or withdraw this capability for more than one
   type of FEC elements, an LDP speaker MUST announce/withdraw them
   separately using the same "Color LSP Capability" TLV.  A receiver
   MUST keep record of the color LSP capabilities of its peer on per-FEC
   basis.

   For example, consider an LSR that supports color LSPs for both IPv4
   Prefixes and IPv6 Prefixes.  The LSR will announce these capabilities
   in different Capability TLVs (either as part of the same LDP
   Initialization/Capability message or separate message) by setting the
   TLV S-bit to 1 and capability data to Typed Wildcard IPv4 Prefix FEC
   and Typed Wildcard IPv6 Prefix FEC (as defined in [RFC5918]).  The
   receiver will keep track of the LSR capability and note it to be
   Color LSP capable for IPv4-Prefix and IPv6-Prefix FEC types.  Later,
   if the LSR withdraws its capability for one of these FEC elements, it
   will send a Capability TLV (in a Capability message) with S-bit set
   to 0 and FEC's Typed Wildcard as the capability data.  On receipt of
   this message, the peer will update accordingly to remove the
   corresponding FEC from LSR's color LSP capability list.

5.  Color Lists

5.1.  Color List TLV

   The Color List TLV is a new optional parameter in the LDP Label
   Mapping and Label Request messages[RFC5036].  The list includes one
   or more color identifiers that LSRs may use to signal interest in a
   forwarding preference.

   U/F-bits:

   An egress LSR MAY include the Color List TLV in a Label Mapping
   Message if using Downstream Unsolicited mode.  An LSR may include the
   TLV in Label Request Messages if using Downstream on Demand mode.  An
   LSR MUST NOT include this TLV in any other LDP message except the
   Label Mapping and Label Request messages.  LSRs SHOULD silently
   discard this TLV if received in other messages and continue
   processing the rest of the message.  A Color List TLV MUST only be
   used in downstream signaled paths.

   An LSR MAY include a Color List TLV List TLV whether the neighbor has
   previously advertised the LDP Color LSP Capability (Section 4) or
   not.  The TLV MUST be forwarded to other neighbors as defined by the
   U/F flags.  This behavior allows LSRs that do not support the Color
   LSP extensions to not preclude the signaling of Color LSPs if they
   are downstream from a Color LSR.

   On receipt of a Color List TLV, a Color LSR with multiple downstream
   paths SHOULD match the list of color identifiers with its local
   association between forwarding paths and colors.  At least one path
   MUST be defined as the "default" path.  This path SHOULD be used as a
   second best match in the absence of an exact color match.  If the
   Color LSR does not have an association between colors and paths or is
   a legacy LSR not supporting the Color LSP extensions, all paths
   SHOULD be treated as default paths.

6.  Color Address Families

   To setup LSPs corresponding to FECs under a given color scope, the
   applicable LDP FEC elements (Section 2) must be extended to include
   the color information.  The Color Id becomes an attribute of such LDP
   FEC elements, and all FEC-Label binding operations are performed
   under the context of the given color.

   To be able to associate a color with a FEC, we define new "color"
   address families as follows:

      Color IP (version 4)

      Color IPv6

   These address families just extend the format of their base address
   family by including color information.  The format of data associated
   with these new address families is described later in sections
   Section 6.1 and Section 6.2.  The proposed new address families can
   be used in any LDP message and procedures defined for Color LSPs.  If
   a receiver does not support these address families received in a
   message, it SHOULD send "Unknown Address Family" notification back to
   the sender and discard the message.

7.  Color FECs

   The following subsection defines the format of the LDP Color FEC
   elements (Section 2) as well as their Typed wildcard [RFC5918]
   counterparts.

7.1.  Color Prefix FEC Element

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     ~                             Prefix                            ~
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |           Color Id            |            Reserved           |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                        "Color Prefix" FEC element

                                 Figure 7

   The definition of these fields follows Section 6 and [RFC5036].  The
   Prefix field can be either an IP (version 4) or an IPv6 address.

7.2.  Color Multipoint FEC Elements

   EDITOR NOTE: To be included in a later version.

7.3.  Procedures

   EDITOR NOTE: To be included in a later version.

8.  Other FEC-based Features

8.1.  Typed Wildcard Forward Equivalence Class

   [RFC5918] extends base LDP and defines Typed Wildcard FEC Element
   framework.  Typed Wildcard FEC element can be used in any LDP message
   to specify a wildcard operation for the given type of FEC.  The Color
   LSP extensions proposed in this document do not require any extension
   in the procedures for Typed Wildcard FEC Element support in
   [RFC5918].

Internet-Draft           LDP Color LSP Signaling               July 2013


   The encoding for a Color Prefix Typed Wildcard FEC element is as
   follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |Typed Wcard (5)|  FEC Type (2) |   Len = 6     | AF=Color IP ..|
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |. or Color IPv6|           Color Id            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                 "Color Prefix Typed Wildcard" FEC element

                                 Figure 8

   The definition of these fields follows [RFC5918] and Section 5.1.

   The Color Prefix Typed Wildcard FEC allows an LSR to perform wildcard
   FEC operations under the scope of a specific color.  For example,
   upon local configuration of color LSP feature for a color C, an LSR
   may send a wildcard label request with Color Id C to learn all its
   labels from the peer under the scope of that color.  If an LSR wishes
   to perform a wildcard operation that applies to all colors, it can
   use the "wildcard color" Color Id.

8.2.  Signaling Convergence (End-of-LIB)

   [RFC5919] specifies extensions and procedures that allows an LDP
   speaker to signal its convergence for a given FEC type towards a peer
   using the corresponding Typed Wildcard FEC element.  Color LSP
   extensions for FECs do not require any change in these procedures and
   they apply as-is to these extended FEC elements.  For instance, an
   LDP speaker MAY signal its LIB convergence per color (or for all
   colors) using a Color Prefix Typed Wildcard FEC element.

8.3.  LSP Ping Extensions

8.3.1.  Color Prefix FEC

   [RFC4379] defines procedures to detect MPLS LSP data-plane failures
   via LSP ping.  The section 3.2 of [RFC4379] defines Sub-Types and
   formats for Sub-TLVs corresponding to FECs.  For "Prefix" FEC, it
   defines "LDP IPv4 prefix" and "LDP IPv6 prefix" sub-types and TLVs.
   To support LSP ping for Color LDP LSPs, this document proposes
   following extensions to [RFC4379]:

      New FEC types: Color LDP IPv4 FEC, and Color LDP IPv6 FEC

Internet-Draft           LDP Color LSP Signaling               July 2013


      New sub-types: for sub-TLVs to specify these FECs in the "Target
      FEC Stack" TLV of [RFC4379]

           Sub-Type       Length              Value Field
           --------       ------          --------------------
             TBA1            5            Color LDP IPv4 prefix
             TBA2           17            Color LDP IPv6 prefix



   The format of these new FEC types is defined as an extension to the
   format of LDP IPv4 prefix and LDP IPv6 prefix sub-TLV by adding color
   information.

   The encoding for a Color LDP IP (version 4) and IPv6 FEC sub-TLVs is
   as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the following new LDP extensions:

      "Color LSP Capability" (codepoint to be allocated from LDP
      registry "TLV Type Name Space")

      Color List TLV (codepoint to be allocated from LDP registry "TLV
      Type Name Space")

      Color Address Families (from registry "Address Familiy Numbers")

         Color IP (version 4)

         Color IPv6

      New Sub-TLV Types under TLV type 1 (Target FEC Stack) from "Multi-
      Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping
      Parameters" registry, and "TLVs and sub-TLVs" sub-registry.

           Sub-Type           Value Field
           --------       ------          --------------------
             TBA1            5            Color LDP IPv4 prefix
             TBA2           17            Color LDP IPv6 prefix

   IANA is requested to assign the LDP capability code point and the
   type values of these TLVs.

10.  Security Considerations

   The MPLS security framework [RFC5920] and the security considerations
   in the LDP specification [RFC5036] apply to this document.
