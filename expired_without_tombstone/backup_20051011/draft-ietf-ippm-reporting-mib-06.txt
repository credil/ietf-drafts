Abstract


   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   designed for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based
   internets.  In particular, this MIB specifies the objects used for
   managing the results of the IPPM metrics measures, for pushing
   alarms, and for reporting the measures results.

Internet-Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  July 2004



1.  Introduction


   This memo defines a MIB for managing network measurements based upon
   the IP performance metrics specified by the IPPM Working Group.


   The definition of objects in the IPPM MIB are built on notions
   introduced and discussed in the IPPM Framework document, RFC 2330
   [RFC2330].


   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB), and as such it
   is intended to be respectful of the "Boilerplate for IETF MIBs"
   defined in http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html.


   There are companion documents to the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB both in the
   Transport Area (See section 2), and in the Operations and Management
   Area (See section 3).  The reader should be familiar with these
   documents.


2.  The IPPM Framework


   The IPPM Framework consists of 3 major components:


   o  A general framework for defining performance metrics, as described
      in the Framework for IP Performance Metrics, RFC 2330 [RFC2330];


   o  A set of standardized metrics which conform to this framework:


      *  IPPM Metrics for Measuring Connectivity, RFC 2678 [RFC2678];


      *  One-way Delay Metrics, RFC 2679  [RFC2679];


      *  One-way Packet Loss Metrics, RFC 2680 [RFC2680];


      *  Round-trip Delay Metrics, RFC 2681 [RFC2681];


      *  One-way Loss Pattern Sample Metrics, RFC 3357 [RFC3357];


      *  IP Packet Delay Variation Metric, RFC 3393 [RFC3393];


      *  IPPM Metrics for periodic streams, RFC 3432 [RFC3432];


   o  Emerging metrics that are being specified in respect of this
      framework.



3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework


   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current




Stephan & Jewitt        Expires January 14, 2005                [Page 4]
Internet-Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  July 2004



   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410];.


   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578];, STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579]; and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580];.


4.  Overview


   Although the number of measurement devices that implement IPPM
   metrics is growing, there is not currently any standardized
   management interface to manage remotely the measurement of these
   metrics.  This memo defines a Management Information Base for
   managing the measurement of IPPM metrics.


   To permit metrics to be referenced by other MIBs and other protocols,
   the IPPM WG has defined a registry of the current metrics and a
   framework for the integration of future metrics in the [IPPM metrics
   registry].


   As the specification of new metrics is a continuous process, this
   memo defines a framework for the integration of the future
   standardized metrics.


   The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB introduces a framework where each application
   identifies its measures in an owner namespace.  The administrator may
   grant access to a measure, or set of measures to another owner via
   view based access control.  As a result, one owner may compute
   aggregated metrics on another owner's network measures.


   Different architectures may be used to perform metric measurements,
   using a control protocol and a test protocol.  Different control
   frameworks are suitable for performing measurements.  The memo lists
   them, while also looking for a way to integrate them with the
   IPPM-REPORTING-MIB.  This section is for informational purposes only,
   and is intended to help specify the relationship among the test
   protocol, the control protocol and the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB.


   Special care has been taken to provide a reporting mode suitable for
   control protocols and test protocols.  It addresses the need to
   provide access to results for the applications.


   This MIB is intended to handle multiple concurrent sessions by SNMP




Stephan & Jewitt        Expires January 14, 2005                [Page 5]
Internet-Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  July 2004



   applications.  However, the SNMP requests are not necessarily to be
   handled explicitly by the measurement devices, but can be sent to
   middleware performing an aggregation function.  This allows for
   continuous collection of measurements and statistics computation.


4.1  Textual Conventions


   Eight types of data are introduced as textual conventions in this
   document: IppmOwnerString, IppmOwnerIndex, TimeUnit, PacketType,
   PacketTypeAddress, GMTTimeStamp, IppmStandardMetrics and
   IppmMetricResultFilter.


4.1.1  OwnerString


   This octet string is used to represent the owners of the various
   measures and reports in the measurement system.


4.1.2  IppmOwnerIndex


   This integer identifies an instance of an object in an owner
   namespace.


4.1.3  TimeUnit


   This textual convention is used to indicate a unit of time, ranging
   from nanosecond, microsecond, millisecond, second, hour, day, and
   week.


4.1.4  PacketType and PacketTypeAddres


   Section 13 of the IPPM framework [2] introduces the generic notion of
   a "packet of type P", because in some contexts the metric's value
   depends on the type of the packets involved in the metric.  In the
   definition of a metric, the type P will be explicitly defined,
   partially defined, or left generic.  Measurement of metrics defined
   with generic type P are made specific when performing actual
   measurements.  It is important that one be conscious of the exact
   type of traffic being measured.


   The standardization of the management of IPPM measures relies on the
   capability to unambiguously configure the type P of the packets, and
   the parameters of the protocol suites of the type P.


   RMON2 introduced the concept of protocol identifiers.  RFC2895 [xxv]
   specifies a macro for the definition of protocol identifier.  The
   RFC2896 [xxvi] defines the protocol identifiers for different
   protocol encapsulation trees.





Stephan & Jewitt        Expires January 14, 2005                [Page 6]
Internet-Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  July 2004



   The type P implementation relies on the MACRO PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER
   defined for identifying protocol suites in RMON2.  It is achieved by
   defining the PacketType and the PacketTypeAddress as new syntax in
   SMIv2 TEXTUAL-CONVENTION.


4.1.4.1  Internet addresses


   The section 14 of the IPPM framework defines (for the usual case of a
   unidirectional path through the Internet) the term "Src" and "Dst".
   "Src" denotes the IP address of the beginning of the path, and "Dst"
   denotes the IP address of the end.


   The section 3 of the RMON PI Reference specifies the Protocol
   Identifier Encoding rules, which consists briefly in a recursive
   length value format.  "Src" and "Dst" are protocol identifier
   parameters.  Their values are encoded in separated fields using the
   encoding rules of the protocol identifier, but without trailing
   parameters.


   The packet encapsulation defined in an instance of PacketType embeds
   the format of "Src" and "Dst" and their values.  The type and value
   of these addresses depend on the type P of the packet, IP version 4,
   IPV6, IP in IP...  Both participate in the completion of the packet
   encoding.


   Examples:


   RFC2896 defines the protocol identifiers ip and ipip4.  Should there
   be an Internet tunnel end-point of the IP address 192.168.1.1 in the
   tunnel 128.2.6.7.  the PacketType of the source address of the
   tunnel, Src, is 'ip.ipip4'.  The encoding of 'ip.ipip4' using the
   RFC2895 rules adds a trailer 2.0.0.  It means that an instance of
   this protocol identifier has 2 parameters, which values will be set
   only when implemented.  In the IPPM PacketType context these 2
   parameters are provided in Src (or Dst).  In the current example the
   value of Src is "192.168.1.1 128.2.6.7".


4.1.5  GMTTimeStamp


   This textual convention defines the time at which an event occurred.
   It is very similar to the NTP timestamp format except that it
   represents the time elapsed since January 1st, 2000 instead of
   January 1st, 1900.


4.1.6  IppmStandardMetrics


   Each standard metric is identified in the IPPM-METRICS-REGISTRY under
   the node rfc in chronological order.  This textual convention defines




Stephan & Jewitt        Expires January 14, 2005                [Page 7]
Internet-Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  July 2004



   an octet string to permit several metrics to be performed in a single
   measure.


4.1.7  Report definition


   A report consists of sending, or logging, a subset of results of
   measurements that have been taken over a period of time.  The report
   defines actions that are taken on the measurement results.  An action
   is performed either:


      For each result;


      On the results corresponding to a measurement cycle;


      On the results available at the measurement completion.


   To preserve the scalability of the whole measurement system, it
   limits:


      The amount of data sent to the applications;


      The bandwidth consumption for uploading the result;


      The number of alarms sent to the applications;


      The amount of data saved in the point of measure.


   Metric thresholds (low, high, inband, outband...) may be defined that
   indicate when measure values should be reported.  These values and
   their associated time may directly impact service availability.


   One may also want to report when particular values (i.e.  constantly
   over a threshold) repeatedly occur over a period of time.  For
   example, if one-way-day is constantly over a specified acceptable
   threshold value for 10 minutes, then the values should be reported.


   The combination of IPPM metric results, threshold events, and event
   filtering provides a very efficient mechanism to report measurement
   results, events, and alarms.


   A report is described using the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   IppmMetricResultFilter.  The report setup must not dramatically
   increase the amount of data needed by the control protocol to setup a
   measure:


      A basic report is defined in the object ippmAggrMeasureFilter;


      More elaborate reports are described using a metric threshold to




Stephan & Jewitt        Expires January 14, 2005                [Page 8]
Internet-Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  July 2004



      generate alarms and events;


      The generation of alarms and reports requires a management station
      address to which the data will be sent;


      SLA alarms are described using an events duration threshold.


   The TEXTUAL-CONVENTION IppmMetricResultFilter specifies the list of
   events and actions that are used to create a report.


4.2  Structure of the MIB


   The MIB is arranged as follow:


      ippmSystem Group:


         ippmPointOfMeasureTable;


         ippmSynchronizationTable;


         ippmMetricsTable.


      ippmOwners Group:


         ippmOwnersTable;


      ippmHistory Group:


         ippmHistoryTable;


      ippmNetMeasure Group:


         ippmNetMeasureTable;


      ippmAggrMeasure Group:


         ippmAggrMeasureTable.


      ippmNotifications



4.2.1  The ippmSystem Group


   The implementation of this group is mandatory.


   This group consists of a set of parameters describing the clock
   synchronization at a particular point of measure over time, as well
   as the system clock of the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB agent.




Stephan & Jewitt        Expires January 14, 2005                [Page 9]
Internet-Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  July 2004



   The table ippmPointOfMeasureTable describes the points of measure.


   The table ippmSynchronisationTable is critical to the implementation,
   especially to be respectful of the Section 6.3.  of the IPPM
   Framework, which states that "Those who develop such measurement
   methodologies should strive to:


      Minimize their uncertainties/errors,


      Understand and document the sources of uncertainty/error, and


      Quantify the amounts of uncertainty/error."


   Consequently the table ippmSynchronisationTable makes these values
   available to compute reliable statistics.


   The table ippmMetricsTable list all the IPPM metrics using the
   registry order and describes their implementation (unit...).


4.2.1.1  The ippmOwners Group


   This group identifies an owner, or group of owners, that have access
   to measurements on a probe.


4.2.2  The ippmHistory Group


   The results of any given measure are stored in the ippmHistoryTable.
   The indexing is such that there is an entry in this table for each
   result of a given measure for a given metric.


4.2.3  The ippmNetMeasure Group


   The control protocol registers a description of the existing network
   measures in the ippmNetMeasureTable.


   This group displays the network measures defined by the control
   protocol.  The results are saved in the ippmHistoryTable.


   ippmNetMeasureTable is a reflection of the configuration of the
   network measure.


4.2.4  The ippmAggrMeasure Group


   ippmAggrMeasureTable is responsible for the aggregation of results.
   The aggregated results are saved in the ippmHistoryTable and may be
   used for higher aggregated measures.

Internet-Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  July 2004



4.2.5  The Notification Group


   The Notification group specifies a list of valid notifications.  They
   are used to generate alarms, or reports, to management applications.


4.3  Row identification in an application namespace


   IPPM metrics measurement is a distributed task.  An owner namespace
   is defined to avoid the need of polling to determine the next free
   index, to avoid index collision when 2 applications are looking for a
   new index as the same time; to increase the speed of the management
   operations; to reduce bandwidth consumption and to reduce CPU load in
   the agents and applications.


   In a MIB, an object instance identifier is defined by the clause
   INDEX of the table as a list of objects.


   The owner namespace is defined in the INDEX as a couple of 2 objects
   where the type of first one is IppmOwnerString and the type of the
   second is IppmOwnerIndex.


   The first term of the instance identifier is the name of the owner.
   The second term is an private index managed by the owner.  This index
   value is unique in an owner namespace.  Before the creation of an
   instance the creator pick up an IppmOwnerIndex value not in use.


   This allows the user to choose arbitrary values for the remaining
   fields of the INDEX clause without checking that the values of these
   fields exists in the MIB tables.  Moreover this allows the owner to
   use the same instance identifier over a set of IPPM MIB
   implementations.


   Measurements are requested by management applications.  An instance
   of an object managed by a management station is identified by the
   management station IppmOwnerString and the private index provided by
   the MS.


4.4  Relationship of IPPM REPORTING MIB tables


   There is inherently a relationship between various tables in the IPPM
   REPORTING MIB, and as such, the data integrity must be assured.  This
   relationship is depicted in the following examples.


4.4.1  Relationship between the Owners Table and the aggregated measure
      table


   The owners table contains the list of "owners" that can create and
   activate remotely aggregated measures in an IPPM agent, or read the




Stephan & Jewitt        Expires January 14, 2005               [Page 11]
Internet-Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  July 2004



   existing network measures.


   It is recommended to make use of "view based access control" in order
   to restrict access to this table.  For example, the master user
   "administrator" may be given "write" privileges on the
   ippmOwnersTable, whereas all others are restricted to "read" access.
   The user "administrator" can then setup the list of other users that
   have access to measures.


   There must be at least 1 owner in the owners' table.  This owner may
   be either setup by default by the IPPM agent, or configured as stated
   above.


   An owner may have multiple corresponding entries in the network and
   aggregated measure tables.  Each entry in a measure table is
   associated with one, and only one, entry in the owners' table.  That
   is to say, that a defined measure may NOT have multiple owners.


   Thus, we have a 1:N relationship between the owners' table and a
   measure table.


4.4.2  Relationship between the Network Measure Table and the Aggregated
      Measure Table


   The network measure table is read-only, thus entries in this table
   must be populated by the agent upon startup.


   The agent could potentially read a database that contains network
   measures configured by a 3rd party proprietary management system that
   directly interacts with the points of measure.  However, the "owner"
   of the measure must be defined in the owners table.  It may be either
   configured directly, or exported to the agent by the external
   measurement tool.


   The aggregated measure table allows for an "owner" to create
   aggregated measures (such as average, minimum, maximum...) on
   existing measures.  An owner may even create aggregated measures on
   network measures that are owned by other owners.  However, it is
   recommended to use view based access control to grant access of
   network measures to other owners in the system.


5.  Measurement architectures


   There are three main measurement architectures.

   +----------------+              +------------------+



   In this architecture, the different NMS's query the
   IPPM-REPORTING-MIB agent for measurements.  The agent controls
   whether the NMS is granted access to perform the measure requested.
   Each NMS may access the results of its measurements in the
   IPPM-REPORTING-MIB history table.


   The measurement setup/teardown and the data collection are done using
   the control protocol and the test protocol.


   In this mode the NMS does not depend on the control protocol nor on
   the test protocol.  The entities involved in the measurement do not
   need to implement the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB nor SNMP.  This mode allows
   for lightweight implementation in the point of measure, and also for
   heterogeneous control protocols to coexist.


   Finally, the proxy is a checkpoint where measurement activity may be
   logged, and where access to measurement setups may be tightly
   controlled.  Thus, it provides a reliable architecture to manage the
   security of a measurement system.

5.2  Reporting architecture


   In this architecture the SNMP protocol is only used to read the
   results of the measurements in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB History Table,
   and also to inform the NMS that an event has occurred.

   The activation of a measure by the control protocol or the test
   protocol creates a measure in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB Network Measure
   table.  The table in question may be not accessible by SNMP.  In this
   case, a list of the measure identifiers (owner, index) is handled by
   the measurement software.


   Each timestamped result of the measure is logged in the
   IPPM-REPORTING-MIB History table in order to allow read access to the
   NMS's and event handling.


   On completion, the measurement results are managed according to the
   measure setup:

Internet-Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  July 2004



      The results may be sent to an NMS;


      They may be dropped from the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB History table.


   In this mode, it is recommended to use an SNMPv2 Inform PDU to send
   reporting events because it ensures that the entire block of the
   result is received.  There is no control using SNMP Trap PDU.

   mode.

   The NMS measurement queries are registered in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB
   gateway and performed by the control and the test protocol.  The NMS
   directly consults the result in the corresponding IPPM REPORTING MIB
   agent of the points of measure.


5.4  Security


   The proxy mode provides flexibility and control of the access to the
   points of measure, while allowing lightweight control protocol and
   test protocol implementations in the points of measure.  Different
   security rules may be applied to the NMS domain and to measurement
   system domains.


   The reporting mode has 2 security domains:


      The control of the measurement setup relies on the control and the
      test protocol security mechanisms;


      The control of access to the results depends on the SNMP security
      mechanisms such as community strings, but may also be restricted
      using VACM for customized access.


   The gateway mode security relies on the security of the proxy mode
   and of the reporting mode.


6.  Reporting mode integration


   The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB standardizes the parameters that:


      Define the configuration of the IPPM metric measures;


      Define the format of the results of the measure;


      Define the report of the IPPM metric measure results.


   It introduces the concept of owner namespace to allow for fast
   configuration and reporting across multiple points of measurement.


   A measure is a distributed object describing a task to be performed
   by the control and the test protocols.  A measure is identified by
   its owner and its owner index.  This identifier is the same in all
   the points of measure.  As the owner chooses the index, there is no
   need for negotiation between the NMS and the points of measure before
   activating the measure.


   A measure is primarily defined by its identifier, the metrics to
   measure, the description of the end point addresses and the
   description of the scheduling of the measure.

Internet-Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  July 2004



   The description of the measure is distributed to the points of
   measure involved.  The distribution may not be synchronized.


6.1  Integration


   The integration of the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB, and the test and control
   protocols consists in pushing the network measure setup/teardown
   parameters and the result values from the measurement software to the
   IPPM-REPORTING-MIB agent.


6.2  Setup of the network measure table


   The measurement system updates the MIB on creation of a network
   measure.


6.3  Setup of the aggregated measure table


   There are 2 ways to setup an aggregated measure: The measurement
   system updates the MIB on creation of an aggregated measure; An SNMP
   application creates an aggregated measure.


6.4  Updating the history of the MIB


   Results have to be written by the measurement task in the agent
   implementing the IPPM REPORTING MIB.


   Adding the results of a measurement consists in the transfer of the
   result from the measurement software to the SNMP agent.  The protocol
   that provides the result may be the control protocol, or the test
   protocol, or another mechanism.


6.5  Default value


   The default values correspond to IP version 4.

      STATUS      current
      DESCRIPTION
       " Each standard metric is identified in the IPPM-METRICS-
       REGISTRY under the node rfc in chronological order. In order to
       allow for several metrics to be calculated in a single measure,
       there is a need to describe in a bit string the metrics to be
       measured.


       This textual convention defines an octet string that gathers in a
       bit string a sequence of bits. The bit order corresponds to the
       order of the metric identifiers in the registry.
       The first bit of the string has the index 0. The index 1
       corresponds to the first metric of the registry
       (instantaneousUnidirectionalConnectivity ).


       Example:
       One-way-Delay(6) is identified as the leaf number 6 of the node
       rfc of the registry. One-way-Packet-Loss(12) is identified as the
       leaf number 12 of the node
       rfc of the registry. A network measure performing both One-way-
       Delay(6) and One-way-Packet-Loss(12) will be described as

   PacketType  ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS       current
     DESCRIPTION
       "This textual convention is a display string used to describe the
       protocol encapsulation list of a packet, and is used as the value
       of the SYNTAX clause for the type of the Src and Dst of an IPPM
       measure. The RFC2895 specifies a macro named PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER
       for the definition of protocol identifiers, while its companion
       document, the RFC2896 defines a set of protocol identifiers.


       PacketType is defined as a display string. It consists of a list
       of dot separated protocol names. Each protocol name has been
       previously defined using the macro PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER of the RFC
       2895.


       Examples:
       The RFC2896 defines the protocol identifiers 'ether2', 'ip',
       'ipip4', 'udp', 'tcp', 'telnet'...


       The PacketType of the source address corresponding to telnet is
       the string 'ip.tcp.telnet'.


       The PacketType of the source address corresponding to UDP packets
       sent in an IP tunnel is the string 'ip.ipip4.udp'.


       Note:
       An IPPM measure is active, so generally a PacketType value does
       not describe the link layer (i.e. ether2...). Valid Internet
       packets are sent from Src to Dst. Then the choice of the link
       layer relies on the Internet stack."

     "Given that not all results from a metric measurement are
        pertinent, and that the size of the history must be limited whenever
        possible, the TC IppmMetricResultFilter defines basic filters to
        limit the among of data collected:


        Filter's parameters are the 2 fields ippmAggrMeasureLowThreshold and
        ippmAggrMeasureLowThreshold of the aggregated measure setup.


        A filter determines if the result of the current aggregation has to
        be stored:


        LogInBandValue:
        The value is stored if it is lower than the high threshold of
        the aggregated measure setup and greater than the low
        threshold of of the aggregated measure setup.


        LogOutBandValue:
        The value is stored if it is greater than the high threshold
        of the aggregated measure setup or lower than the low
        threshold of the aggregated measure setup.

        of the aggregated measure setup.


        LogBelowValue:
        The value is stored if it is lower than the low metric
        threshold field of the aggregated measure setup.


        logUpAndDownValue:
        This filter stores contiguous results that are on opposite
        sides of the up and down metric thresholds:
             A result is stored if it is the first result aggregated:
        If it is greater than the high threshold and lower than the
        low threshold then its value is set to the value of the low
        threshold;


             A result greater than the high threshold is stored if the
        previous result is lower than the low threshold;


             A result lower than the low threshold is stored if the

8.  Security Considerations


8.1  VACM Access control


   View Based Access Control, or VACM may be used to restrict access to
   certain objects, or even object instances within tables.  For
   example, one may:


   o  Give an 'administrator' write access to the ippmOwnersTable,
      whereas all other users may only have read access;


   o  Give access to individual rows in the network measure, aggregated
      measure, history, and report table to particular owners based upon
      indexing on an 'owners name', and even upon a particular measure.
      This will be illustrated below.


   o  Give access of one owner's measure, and associated results, to
      another owner in order to create an aggregated measure based upon
      the results.



8.1.1  Example of implementing VACM control for the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB


   The following example illustrates how one could use VACM to restrict
   access to particular objects within the MIB.  It uses syntax specific
   to a particular agent development toolkit, but may be generalized
   using the concepts as defined in the VACM MIB.


   In this example, we have two NMS users, namely user1=owner1 and
   user2=owner2:


   1) First we define the two users and their host addresses:


   com2sec        owner1    owner1computer@    private


   com2sec        owner2    owner2computer@    private


   2) We then define SNMPv2c groups


   group    owner1    v2c    owner1

   group    owner2    v2c    owner2


   view    notif        included    ippmNotifications    ff


   3.1) For the user owner1, we now define the views for which he will
   have read access

   3.5) Now we give the two users access to the views defined above.
   Note that owner1 and owner2 have read access to owner1read and
   owner2read views respectively.  They have write access to owner1write
   and owner2write view respectively.  And they both have access to all
   the notifications.


   access    owner1    ""    any    noauth    exact    owner1read
   owner1write    notif


   access    owner2    ""    any    noauth    exact    owner2read
   owner2write    notif


8.2  Privacy


   The privacy concerns of network measurement are intrinsically limited
   by the active measurements.  Unlike passive measurements, there can
   be no release of existing user data.


8.3  Measurement aspects


   Conducting Internet measurements raises both security and privacy
   concerns.  This memo does not specify an implementation of the
   metrics, so it does not directly affect the security of the Internet
   nor of applications that run on the Internet.  However,
   implementations of these metrics must be mindful of security and
   privacy concerns.


   There are two types of security concerns: potential harm caused by
   the measurements, and potential harm to the measurements.  The
   measurements could cause harm because they are active, and inject
   packets into the network.  The measurement parameters MUST be
   carefully selected so that the measurements inject trivial amounts of
   additional traffic into the networks they measure.  If they inject
   "too much" traffic, they can skew the results of the measurement, and




Stephan & Jewitt        Expires January 14, 2005               [Page 73]
Internet-Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  July 2004



   in extreme cases cause congestion and denial of service.


   The measurements themselves could be harmed by routers giving
   measurement traffic a different priority than "normal" traffic, or by
   an attacker injecting artificial measurement traffic.  If routers can
   recognize measurement traffic and treat it separately, the
   measurements will not reflect actual user traffic.  If an attacker
   injects artificial traffic that is accepted as legitimate, the loss
   rate will be artificially lowered.  Therefore, the measurement
   methodologies SHOULD include appropriate techniques to reduce the
   probability measurement traffic can be distinguished from "normal"
   traffic.


   Authentication techniques, such as digital signatures, may be used
   where appropriate to guard against injected traffic attacks.


8.4  Management aspects


   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-only.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.


   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/
   SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.


   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [18] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [21] is recommended.


   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/
   create/delete) them.


9.  Document management


9.1  Open issues


      Do we use accessible-for-notify to report index values in the
      notifications ?

      ippmNetMeasure items Read Write ?


      Do we need an "IANA Considerations" Section ?


      Do we need separate NetMeasure history from aggregateMeasure
      History (may help compliance module spec) ?



9.2  Changes done since release 05


   o  Document rewriten in xml;


   o  Section 3 updated with the "standard" introductionary text for
      MIB;


   o  nodes cleanup;


   o  ippmNetMeasure max acces set to read-create;


   o  proxy compliances module reviewed for the usage of the
      ippmNetMeasureTable with a min acces of read-only;


   o  A new co-authored: Tom;



9.3  Changes done since release 04


   o  Report Group deleted:


      *  reportHistoryTable deleted;


      *  reportSetupTable deleted;


   o  6 related notifications deleted;


   o  low and high thresholds added in ippmAggrMeasureTable;


   o  TC IppmOwnerIndex added to clearly define the owner namespace.


   o  GMTTimestamp time origine changed to NTP (1900).



9.4  Changes done since release 03


   o  SMI subtype: INTEGER vs Integer32...;


   o  SMI UNITS: Clauses added;

   o  cleanup of DEFVAL values;


   o  Counter/index wrapping:


   o  the index of the table wrap independently of the sequence of the
      results.  That makes it very difficult for application to track
      the results.  As the sequence id identify the instance of the
      result of a measure the index is removed both from the table and
      from the index clause:


      *  ippmHistoryIndex removed from ippmHistoryEntry;


      *  ippmHistoryIndex removed from the INDEX clause of the table
         ippmHistoryTable;


      *  ippmReportIndex removed from ippmAggrHistoryEntry;


      *  ippmReportIndex removed from the clause INDEX of
         ippmAggrHistoryEntry INDEX clause of the table
         ippmAggrHistoryTable;



9.5  Changes done since release 02


   o  Security/VACM: sharing table removed; ippmMeasure merged with
      networkMeasure and AggrMeasure to have all networkMeasure objects
      in read only.  Indexes belong to the table; remove all reference
      to SNMPv1 ...inSNMPTrapPDU


   o  System: ippmSystemOperationalStatus added ippmSynchronizationTable
      adapted for proxy mode: ippmPointOfMeasureIndex added to the index
      of ippmSystemCurrentSynchronization removed from system
      capabilities: ippmPointOfMeasureMetrics added to
      IppmPointOfMeasureEntry; ippmMetricsType added to
      ippmMetricsTable;


   o  Owners: ippmMetricMaxHistorySize replaced with quota in
      ippmOwnersTable;


   o  ippmOnHistoryFullAction replaced with resultsMgmt in aggr and
      network.;


   o  network measure: ippmNetMeasureOperState added to indicate the
      state of the network measure state; added burst mode; state of the
      measure: nb of singletons collected and oper status added;


   o  aggregated metric: fast report added to get raw results by email;
