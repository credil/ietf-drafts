         IANA Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Transition Space
             draft-weil-shared-transition-space-request-00

Abstract

   This document requests a reserved IANA IPv4 address allocation as
   Shared Transition Space to support the deployment of IPv4 address
   sharing technologies post IPv4 exhaustion.

Internet-Draft       Shared Transition Space Request       November 2010


1.  Introduction

   Many operators are currently implimenting their IPv6 transition
   plans.  During the transition, continued support for heritage IPv4
   only devices will be required.  While most operators are well aware
   of the limitations of NAT444 [I-D.shirasaki-nat444], it is the
   transition mechnism that has the least customer impact for many
   carriers.

   To deal with some of the NAT444 limitations, it becomes necessary for
   a provider to utilize address space in the NAT444 infrastructure that
   will not conflict with it's customer space.

   This document requests that IANA reserve a portion of the remaining
   unallocated space as Shared Transition Space for the enablement of a
   clean transition strategy in provider networks.

2.  Motivation

   The Internet community is rapidly consuming the remaining supply of
   unallocated IPv4 addresses.  During the transition period to IPv6, it
   is imperative that Service Providers maintain IPv4 service for
   devices and networks that are currently incapable of upgrading to
   IPv6.

   In order to provide IPv4 service to customers and/or devices once the
   IPv4 address space is exhausted, Service Providers must multiplex
   several subscribers behind a single IPv4 address using one of several
   techniques including NAT444 .  Providers need sufficient non-
   [RFC1918] address space to deploy such technologies and avoid overlap
   with customer use of private address space.

3.  Shared Transition Space

   This document proposes the assignment of the equivalent of a /10 as
   Shared Transition Space.  This block MAY be composed of one
   contiguous assignment, or several discontiguous assignments.  Shared
   Transition Space is IPv4 address space reserved for Infrastructure
   provider use with the purpose of facilitating IPv6 transition and
   IPv4 coexistence deployment.  The requested block SHOULD NOT be
   utilized for any purpose other than IPv4 to IPv6 transition
   infrastructure.  Network equipment manufacturers MUST NOT use the
   assigned block in default or example device configurations.

   Because Shared Transition addresses have no meaning outside of the
   Infrastructure Provider, routing information about shared transition
   space networks MUST NOT be propagated on IInterdomain links, and
   packets with shared transition source or destination addresses SHOULD
   NOT be forwarded across such links.  Internet service providers
   SHOULD filter out routing information about shared transition space
   networks on ingress links.

4.  Security Considerations

   This memo does not define any protocol, and raises no security
   issues.  Any addresses allocated as Shared Transition Space would not
   be routable on the Internet.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to reserve an IPv4 /10 from its remaining pool of
   unallocated IPv4 addresses for use as Shared Transition Space.
