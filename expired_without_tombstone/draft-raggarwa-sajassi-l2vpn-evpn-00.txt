3. Introduction

   This document describes procedures for BGP MPLS based Ethernet VPNs
   (E-VPN).  The procedures described here are intended to meet the
   requirements in [E-VPN-REQ].  Please refer to [E-VPN-REQ] for the
   detailed requirements and motivation.

   This document proposes a MPLS based technology, referred to as MPLS-
   based E-VPN (E-VPN). E-VPN requires extensions to existing IP/MPLS
   protocols as described in section 5. In addition to these extensions
   E-VPN uses several building blocks from existing MPLS technologies.



4. Terminology

   CE: Customer Edge device e.g., host or router or switch
   MES: MPLS Edge Switch
   EVI: E-VPN Instance
   ESI: Ethernet segment identifier
   LACP: Link Aggregation Control Protocol
   MP2MP: Multipoint to Multipoint
   P2MP: Point to Multipoint
   P2P: Point to Point

5. BGP MPLS Based E-VPN Overview

   This section provides an overview of E-VPN.

   An E-VPN comprises CEs that are connected to PEs or MPLS Edge
   Switches (MES) that comprise the edge of the MPLS infrastructure. A
   CE may be a host, a router or a switch. The MPLS Edge Switches
   provide layer 2 virtual bridge connectivity between the CEs. There
   may be multiple E-VPNs in the provider's network. This document uses
   the terms E-VPN and E-VPN inter-changeably. A E-VPN routing and
   forwarding instance on a MES is referred to as a E-VPN Instance
   (MVI).

   The MESes are connected by a MPLS LSP infrastructure which provides
   the benefits of MPLS such as fast-reroute, resiliency etc.

   In a E-VPN, learning between MESes occurs not in the data plane (as
   happens with traditional bridging) but in the control plane. Control
   plane learning offers much greater control over the learning process,
   such as restricting who learns what, and the ability to apply
   policies.  Furthermore, the control plane chosen for this is BGP
   (very similar to IP VPNs (RFC 4364)), providing much greater scale,
   and the ability to "virtualize" or isolate groups of interacting
   agents (hosts, servers, Virtual Machines) from each other. In E-VPNs
   MESes advertise the MAC addresses learned from the CEs that are
   connected to them, along with a MPLS label, to other MESes in the
   control plane. Control plane learning enables load balancing and
   allows CEs to connect to multiple active points of attachment. It
   also improves convergence times in the event of certain network
   failures.

   However, learning between MESes and CEs is done by the method best
   suited to the CE: data plane learning, IEEE 802.1x, LLDP, 802.1aq or
   other protocols.

   It is a local decision as to whether the Layer 2 forwarding table on
   a MES contains all the MAC destinations known to the control plane or
   implements a cache based scheme. For instance the forwarding table
   may be populated only with the MAC destinations of the active flows
   transiting a specific MES.

   The policy attributes of a E-VPN are very similar to an IP VPN. A E-
   VPN instance requires a Route-Distinguisher (RD) and a E-VPN requires
   one or more Route-Targets (RTs). A CE attaches to a E-VPN on a MES in
   a particular MVI on a VLAN or simply an ethernet interface. When the
   point of attachment is a VLAN there may be one or more VLANs in a
   particular E-VPN. Some deployment scenarios guarantee uniqueness of
   VLANs across E-VPNs: all points of attachment of a given E-VPN use

Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   the same VLAN, and no other E-VPN uses this VLAN. This document
   refers to this case as a "Default Single VLAN E-VPN" and describes
   simplified procedures to optimize for it.



6. Ethernet Segment Identifier

   If a CE is multi-homed to two or more MESes, the set of attachment
   circuits constitutes an "Ethernet segment". An Ethernet segment may
   appear to the CE as a Link Aggregation Group (LAG).  Ethernet
   segments have an identifier, called the "Ethernet Segment Identifier"
   (ESI).  A single-homed CE is considered to be attached to a Ethernet
   segment with ESI 0.  Otherwise, an Ethernet segment MUST have a
   unique non-zero ESI.  The ESI can be assigned using various
   mechanisms:

   1. The ESI may be configured. For instance when E-VPNs are used to
   provide a VPLS service the ESI is fairly analagous to the Multi-
   homing site ID in [BGP-VPLS-MH].

   2. If LACP is used, between the MESes and CEs, then the ESI is
   determined by LACP. This is the LAG system ID (48 bit MAC address)
   and the CE's LAG Aggregator Key. This is the 48 bit virtual MAC
   address of the CE for the LACP link bundle and the CE's LAG
   Aggregator Key.  As far as the CE is concerned it would treat the
   multiple MESes that it is homed to as the same switch. This allows
   the host to aggregate links to different MESes in the same bundle.

   3. If LLDP is used, between the MESes and CEs that are hosts, then
   the ESI is determined by LLDP. The ESI will be specified in a
   following version.

   4. In the case of indirectly connected hosts and a bridged LAN
   between the hosts and the MESes, the ESI is determined based on the
   Layer 2 bridge protocol as follows: If STP is used then the value of
   the ESI is derived by listening to BPDUs on the ethernet segment. The
   MES does not run STP. However it does learn the Switch ID, MSTP ID
   and Root Bridge ID by listening to BPDUs. The ESI is as follows:

         {Switch ID (6 bits), MSTP ID (6 bits), Root Bridge ID (48
   bits)}

7. BGP E-VPN NLRI

   This document defines a new BGP NLRI, called the E-VPN NLRI.

   Following is the format of the E-VPN NLRI:

                +-----------------------------------+
                |    Route Type (1 octet)           |
                +-----------------------------------+
                |     Length (1 octet)              |
                +-----------------------------------+
                | Route Type specific (variable)    |
                +-----------------------------------+


   The Route Type field defines encoding of the rest of E-VPN NLRI
   (Route Type specific E-VPN NLRI).

   The Length field indicates the length in octets of the Route Type
   specific field of E-VPN NLRI.

   This document defines the following Route Types:

     + 1 - Ethernet Tag Auto-Discovery (A-D) route
     + 2 - MAC advertisement route
     + 3 - Inclusive Multicast Route
     + 4 - Ethernet Segment Route
     + 5 - Selective Multicast Auto-Discovery (A-D) Route
     + 6 - Leaf Auto-Discovery (A-D) Route

   The detailed encoding and procedures for these route types are
   described in subsequent sections.

   The E-VPN NLRI is carried in BGP [RFC4271] using BGP Multiprotocol
   Extensions [RFC4760] with an AFI of TBD and an SAFI of E-VPN (To be
   assigned by IANA). The NLRI field in the
   MP_REACH_NLRI/MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute contains the E-VPN NLRI
   (encoded as specified above).

   In order for two BGP speakers to exchange labeled E-VPN NLRI, they
   must use BGP Capabilities Advertisement to ensure that they both are
   capable of properly processing such NLRI. This is done as specified
   in [RFC4760], by using capability code 1 (multiprotocol BGP) with an
   AFI of TBD and an SAFI of E-VPN.

8. ES-Import Extended Community

   This extended community is a new transitive extended community and it
   includes all the MESes connected to the same multi-homed site. It is
   used to distribute Ethernet Segment routes. The value is derived
   automatically from the ESI by encoding the 6-byte system MAC address
   of the ESI in this RT.  In order to derive this RT automatically, it
   is assumed that the system MAC address of the CE is unique in the
   network.

   Each ES-Import extended community is encoded as a 8-octet value as
   follows:


      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


9. Auto-Discovery

   EVPN requires the following types of auto-discovery procedures:

     +  EVPN Auto-Discovery, which allows an MES to discover the other
       MESes in the EVPN. Each MES advertises one or more "Inclusive
       Multicast Tag Routes".  The procedures for advertising these
       routes are described in the section on "Handling of Multi-
       Destination Traffic".

     +  Auto-Discovery of Ethernet Tags on Ethernet Segments, in a
       particular EVPN.  The procedures are described in section "Auto-
       Discovery of Ethernet Tags on Ethernet Segments".

     +  Ethernet Segment Auto-Discovery used for auto-discovery of MESes
       that are multi-homed to the same ethernet segment. The procedures
       are described in section XXX and XXX.

10. Auto-Discovery of Ethernet Tags on Ethernet Segments

   If a CE is multi-homed to two or more MESes on a particular ethernet
   segment, each MES MUST advertise to other MSEs in the E-VPN, the
   information about one or more Ethernet Tags (e.g., VLANs) on that
   ethernet segment. If a CE is not multi-homed, then the MES that it is
   attached to MAY advertise the information about Ethernet Tags (e.g.,
   VLANs) on the ethernet segment connected to the CE.

   The information about an Ethernet Tag on a particular ethernet
   segment is advertised using a "Ethernet Tag Auto-Discovery route
   (Ethernet Tag A-D route)". This route is advertised using the E-VPN
   NLRI.

   The Ethernet Tag Auto-discovery information is used for Designated
   Forwarder (DF) election as described in section "Desiginated
   Forwarder Election". It is also used to enable equal cost multi-path
   as described in section "Load Balancing of Unicast Packets". Further,
   it can be used to optimize withdrawl of MAC addresses as described in
   section "Convergence".

   This section describes procedures for advertising one or more
   Ethernet Tag A-D routes per E-VPN. We will call this as "Ethernet Tag
   A-D route per E-VPN". This section also describes procedures to
   advertise and withdraw a single Ethernet Tag A-D route per Ethernet
   Segment.  We will call this as "Ethernet Tag A-D route per Segment".


10.1. Constructing the Ethernet Tag A-D Route

   The format of the Ethernet Tag A-D NLRI is specified in section "BGP
   E-VPN NLRI".


10.1.1. Ethernet Tag A-D Route per E-VPN

   This section describes procedures to construct the Ethernet Tag A-D
   route when one or more such routes are advertised by a MES for a
   given E-VPN instance.

   Route-Distinguisher (RD) MUST be set to the RD of the E-VPN instance
   that is advertising the NLRI. A RD MUST be assigned for a given E-VPN
   instance on a MES. This RD MUST be unique across all E-VPN instances
   on a MES. This can be accomplished by using a Type 1 RD [RFC4364].
   The value field comprises an IP address of the MES (typically, the
   loopback address) followed by a number unique to the MES.  This
   number may be generated by the MES, or, in the Default Single VLAN E-
   VPN case, may be the 12 bit VLAN ID, with the remaining 4 bits set to

Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   0.

   Ethernet Segment Identifier MUST be an 8 octet entity as described in
   section "Ethernet Segment Identifier". This MAY be set to 0.

   The Ethernet Tag ID is the identifier of an Ethernet Tag on the
   ethernet segment. This value may be a two octet VLAN ID or it may be
   another Ethernet Tag used by the E-VPN. It MAY be set to the default
   Ethernet Tag on the ethernet segment or 0.

   Note that the above allows the Ethernet Tag A-D route to be
   advertised with one of the following granularities:

     + One Ethernet Tag A-D route for a given <ESI, Ethernet Tag ID>
       tuple per E-VPN

     + One Ethernet Tag A-D route for a given <ESI> in a given E-VPN
       where the Ethernet Tag ID is set to 0.

     + One Ethernet Tag A-D route for a given <Ethernet Tag ID> in a
       given E-VPN where the ESI is set to 0.

     + One Ethernet Tag A-D route for the E-VPN where both ESI and
       Ethernet Tag ID are set to 0.


   E-VPNs support both the non-qualified and qualified learning model.
   When non-qualified learning is used the Ethernet Tag Identifier
   specified in this section and in other places in this document MUST
   be set to a default value. When qualified learning is used and the
   Ethernet Tags been MESes and CEs in the E-VPN are consistantly
   assigned for a given broadcast domain, the Ethernet Tag Identifier
   MUST be set to the Ethernet Tag for the concerned broadcast domain
   between the advertising MES and the CE.  When qualified learning is
   used and the Ethernet Tags been MESes and CEs in the E-VPN are not
   consistantly assigned for a given broadcast domain, the Ethernet Tag
   Identifier MUST be set to an E-VPN provider assigned tag that maps
   locally on the advertising MES to an ethernet broadcast domain
   identifier such as a VLAN ID.


   The usage of the MPLS label is described in section on "Load
   Balancing of Unicast Packets".

   The Originating Router's IP address MUST be set to an IP address of
   the PE.  This address SHOULD be common for all the MVIs on the PE
   (e.,g., this address may be PE's loopback address).

Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   The Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute of the route MUST
   be set to the same IP address as the one carried in the Originating
   Router's IP Address field.


10.1.1.1. Ethernet Tag A-D Route Targets

   The Ethernet Tag A-D route MUST carry one or more Route Target (RT)
   attributes. RTs may be configured (as in IP VPNs), or may be derived
   automatically.

   If a MES uses Route Target Constrain [RT-CONSTRAIN], the MES SHOULD
   advertise all such RTs using Route Target Constrains This allows each
   Ethernet Tag A-D route to reach only the relevant MESes.


10.1.1.1.1. Auto-Derivation from the Ethernet Tag ID

   The following is the procedure for deriving the RT attribute
   automatically from the Ethernet Tag ID associated with the
   advertisement:

     +      The Global Administrator field of the RT MUST
            be set to the Autonomous System (AS) number that the MES
       belongs to.

     +      The Local Administrator field of the RT contains a 4
            octets long number that encodes the Ethernet Tag-ID.

   The above auto-configuration of the RT implies that a different RT is
   used for every Ethernet Tag in a E-VPN, if the E-VPN contains
   multiple Ethernet Tags. For the "Default Single VLAN E-VPN" this
   results in auto-deriving the RT from the Ethernet Tag for that E-VPN.


10.1.2. Ethernet Tag A-D Route per Ethernet Segment

   This section describes procedures to construct the Ethernet Tag A-D
   route when a single such route is advertised by a MES for a given
   Ethernet Segment.

   Route-Distinguisher (RD) MUST be a Type 1 RD [RFC4364]. The value
   field comprises an IP address of the MES (typically, the loopback
   address) followed 0.

   Ethernet Segment Identifier MUST be an 8 octet entity as described in
   section "Ethernet Segment Identifier".

Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   The Ethernet Tag ID MUST be set to 0.



10.1.2.1. Ethernet Tag A-D Route Targets

   The Ethernet Tag A-D route MUST carry one or more Route Target (RT)
   attributes. These RTs MUST be the set of RTs associated with all the
   E-VPN instances to which the Ethernet Segment, corresponding to the
   Ethernet Tag A-D route, belongs.


10.2. Motivations for Ethernet Tag A-D Route per Ethernet Segment

   This section describes various scenarios in which the Ethernet Tag A-
   D route should be advertised per Ethernet Segment.


10.2.1. Optimizing Control Plane Convergence

   Ethernet Tag A-D route per Ethernet Segment should be advertised when
   it is desired to optimize the control plane convergence of the
   withdrawl of the Ethernet Segment A-D routes. If this is done then
   when an ethernet segment fails, the single Ethernet Tag A-D route
   corresponding to the segment can be withdrawn first. This allows all
   MESes that receive this withdrawl to invalidate the MAC routes
   learned from the ethernet segment.

   Note that the Ethernet Tag A-D route per Ethernet Segment, when used
   to optimize control plane convergence, is advertised in addition to
   the Ethernet Tag A-D routes per EVPN.


10.2.2. Reducing number of Ethernet Tag A-D Routes

   In certain scenarios advertising Ethernet Tag A-D routes per ethernet
   segment, instead of per E-VPN, may reduce the number of Ethernet Tag
   A-D routes in the network. In these scenarios Ethernet Tag A-D routes
   may be advertised per ethernet segment instead of per E-VPN.

11. Multi-Homed Ethernet Segment Auto-Discovery

   Each MES advertises a route for a multi-homed ethernet segment,
   referred to as an Ethernet Segment Route. This allows the set of
   MESes connected to the same CE to discover each other automatically
   with minimal to no configuration. The procedures for constructing
   this route are described below. The usage of this route is described
   in the sections on "DF election" and "Split Horizon".


11.1. Constructing the Ethernet Segment Route

   The NLRI format is described in section "BGP E-VPN NLRI".

   The RD MUST be the RD of the E-VPN instance that is advertising the
   NLRI. The procedures for setting the RD for a given E-VPN are
   described in section 10.1.1.

   The Ethernet Segment Identifier MUST be set to the eight octet ESI
   identifier described in section 6.

   The MPLS label is referred to as an "ESI label". This label MUST be a
   downstream assigned MPLS label if the advertising MES is using
   ingress replication for sending multicast, broadcast or unknown
   unicast traffic, to other MESes. If the advertising MES is using P2MP
   MPLS LSPs for the same, then this label MUST be an upstream assigned
   MPLS label. The usage of this label is described in section "Split
   Horizon".

   The Originating Router's IP address MUST be set to an IP address of
   the PE.  This address SHOULD be common for all the MVIs on the PE
   (e.,g., this address may be PE's loopback address).

   The Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute of the route MUST
   be set to the same IP address as the one carried in the Originating
   Router's IP Address field.

   The BGP advertisement that advertises the Ethernet Segment route MUST
   also carry one Route Target (RT) attribute. The construction of this
   RT is specified below.


11.1.1. Ethernet Segment Route Target and Filtering

   The Ethernet Segment Route Filtering should be done such that the
   Ethernet Segment Route is imported only by the MESes that are multi-
   homed to the Ethernet Segment. There are two mechanisms for doing
   this filtering.

Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


11.1.1.1. ESI Import Extended Community

   This approach applies only when it can be assumed that the system MAC
   addresses of the CEs are unique in the network.

   Each MES that is connected to a particular ESI constructs an import
   filtering rule to import a route that carries the ES-Import extended
   community, described in section 9, constructed from the ESI.

   Note that the new ES-Import extended community is not the same as the
   Route Target Extended Community. The Ethernet Segment route carries
   this new ES-Import extended community. The MESes apply filtering on
   this new extended community. As a result the Ethernet Segment route
   is imported only by the MESes that are connected to the ethernet
   segment.

   This approach requires a new ES-Import extended community for
   filtering.


11.1.1.2. Route Target

   If this approach is used then the Ethernet Segment route MUST carry
   one or more Route Target (RT) attributes. These RTs MUST be the set
   of RTs associated with all the E-VPN instances to which the Ethernet
   Segment, corresponding to the Ethernet Segment route, belongs.

   This approach is to be used when the system MAC addresses of the CEs
   cannot be assumed to be unique.


11.2. Carrying LAG specific Information

   This route will be enhanced to carry LAG specific information such as
   LACP parameters in the future.



12. Determining Reachability to Unicast MAC Addresses

   MESes forward packets that they receive based on the destination MAC
   address. This implies that MESes must be able to learn how to reach a
   given destination unicast MAC address.

   There are two components to MAC address learning, "local learning"
   and "remote learning":





raggarwa-sajassi, et.al.                                       [Page 17]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


12.1. Local Learning

   A particular MES must be able to learn the MAC addresses from the CEs
   that are connected to it. This is referred to as local learning.

   The MESes in a particular E-VPN MUST support local data plane
   learning using vanilla ethernet learning procedures. A MES must be
   capable of learning MAC addresses in the data plane when it receives
   packets such as the following from the CE network:

     - DHCP requests

     - gratuitous ARP request for its own MAC.

     - ARP request for a peer.


   Alternatively if a CE is a host then MESes MAY learn the MAC
   addresses of the host in the control plane.

   In the case where a CE is a host or a switched network connected on
   ESI X to hosts, the MAC address that is reachable via a given MES may
   move such that it becomes reachable via the same MES on another MES
   on ESI Y.  This is referred to as a "MAC Move" Procedures to support
   this are described in section "MAC Moves".


12.2. Remote learning

   A particular MES must be able to determine how to send traffic to MAC
   addresses that belong to or are behind CEs connected to other MESes
   i.e. to remote CEs or hosts behind remote CEs. We call such MAC
   addresses as "remote" MAC addresses.

   This document requires a MES to learn remote MAC addresses in the
   control plane. In order to achieve this each MES advertises the MAC
   addresses it learns from its locally attached CEs in the control
   plane, to all the other MESes in the E-VPN, using BGP.


12.2.1. Constructing the BGP E-VPN MAC Address Advertisement

   BGP is extended to advertise these MAC addresses using the MAC
   advertisement route type in the E-VPN-NLRI.

   The RD MUST be the RD of the E-VPN instance that is advertising the
   NLRI. The procedures for setting the RD for a given E-VPN are
   described in section 10.1.1.



raggarwa-sajassi, et.al.                                       [Page 18]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   The Ethernet Segment Identifier is set to the eight octet ESI
   identifier described in section "Ethernet Segment Identifier".

   The Ethernet Tag ID may be zero or may represent a valid Ethernet Tag
   ID.  This field may be non-zero in the following cases:

     +  If there are multiple bridge domains in the E-VPN instance.

     +  If qualified learning is used between the MESes and the CEs in
       the E-VPN.


   When the the Ethernet Tag ID in the NLRI is set to a non-zero value,
   for a particular bridge domain, then this Ethernet TAG ID may either
   be the ethernet tag value associated with the CE or it may be the
   Ethernet Tag Identifier assigned by the E-VPN provider and mapped to
   the CE's ethernet tag. The latter would be the case if the CE
   ethernet tags for a particular bridge domain are different on
   different CEs.

   The MAC address length field is typically set to 48. However this
   specification enables specifying the MAC address as a prefix in which
   case the MAC address length field is set to the length of the prefix.
   This enables aggregation of MAC addresses if the deployment
   environment supports that. The encoding of a MAC address is the
   6-octet MAC address specified by IEEE 802 documents [802.1D-ORIG]
   [802.1D-REV].  If the MAC address is advertised as a prefix then the
   trailing bits of the prefix MUST be set to 0 to ensure that the
   entire prefix is encoded as 6 octets.

   The MPLS label field carries one or more labels (that corresponds to
   the stack of labels [MPLS-ENCAPS]).  Each label is encoded as 3
   octets, where the high-order 20 bits contain the label value, and the
   low order bit contains "Bottom of Stack" (as defined in [MPLS-
   ENCAPS]).

   The MPLS label stack MUST be the downstream assigned E-VPN MPLS label
   stack that is used by the MES to forward MPLS encapsulated ethernet
   packets received from remote MESes, where the destination MAC address
   in the ethernet packet is the MAC address advertised in the above
   NLRI. The forwarding procedures are specified in section "Forwarding
   Unicast Packets" and "Load Balancing of Unicast Packets".

   A MES may advertise the same single E-VPN label for all MAC addresses
   in a given E-VPN instance. This label assignment methodology is
   referred to as a per MVI label assigment. Or a MES may advertise a
   unique E-VPN label per <ESI, Ethernet Tag> combination. This label
   methodology is referred to as a per <ESI, Ethernet Tag> label



raggarwa-sajassi, et.al.                                       [Page 19]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   assignment. Or a MES may advertise a unique E-VPN label per MAC
   address.  All of these methodologies have their tradeoffs.

   Per MVI label assignment requires the least number of E-VPN labels,
   but requires a MAC lookup in addition to a MPLS lookup on an egress
   MES for forwarding. On the other hand a unique label per <ESI,
   Ethernet Tag> or a unique label per MAC allows an egress MES to
   forward a packet that it receives from another MES, to the connected
   CE, after looking up only the MPLS labels and not having to do a MAC
   lookup.

   A MES may also advertise more than one label for a given MAC address.
   For instance a MES may advertise two labels, one of which is for the
   ESI corresponding to the MAC address and the second is for the
   Etherent Tag on the ESI that the MAC address is learned on.

   The Originating Router's IP address MUST be set to an IP address of
   the PE.  This address SHOULD be common for all the MVIs on the PE
   (e.,g., this address may be PE's loopback address).

   The Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute of the route MUST
   be set to the same IP address as the one carried in the Originating
   Router's IP Address field.

   The BGP advertisement that advertises the MAC advertisement route
   MUST also carry one or more Route Target (RT) attributes.  RTs may be
   configured (as in IP VPNs), or may be derived automatically from the
   Ethernet Tag ID, in the single VLAN case as described in section
   13.1.1.1.

   It is to be noted that this document does not require MESes to create
   forwarding state for remote MACs when they are learned in the control
   plane. When this forwarding state is actually created is a local
   implementation matter.


13. Designated Forwarder Election

   Consider a CE that is a host or a router that is multi-homed directly
   to more than one MES in a E-VPN on a given ethernet segment. One or
   more Ethernet Tags may be configured on the ethernet segment. In this
   scenario only one of the MESes, referred to as the Designated
   Forwarder (DF), is responsible for certain actions:

     -      Sending multicast and broadcast traffic, on a given Ethernet
            Tag on a particular ethernet segment, to the CE. Note that
            this behavior, which allows selecting a DF at the
            granularity of <ESI, Ethernet Tag> for multicast and



raggarwa-sajassi, et.al.                                       [Page 20]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


            broadcast traffic is the default behavior in this
            specification. Optional mechanisms, which will be
            specified in the future, will allow selecting a DF
            at the granularity of <ESI, Ethernet Tag, S, G>.

     -      Flooding unknown unicast traffic (i.e. traffic for
            which a MES does not know the destination MAC address),
            on a given Ethernet Tag on a particular ethernet segment
            to the CE, if the environment requires flooding of
            unknown unicast traffic.


   Note that a CE always sends packets using a single link. For instance
   if the CE is a host then, as mentioned earlier, the host treats the
   multiple links that it uses to reach the MESes as a Link Aggregation
   Group (LAG).

   If a bridge network is multi-homed to more than one MES in a E-VPN
   via switches, then the support of active-active points of attachments
   as described in this specification requires the bridge network to be
   connected to two or more MESes using a LAG. In this case the reasons
   for doing DF election are the same as those described above when a CE
   is a host or a router.

   If a bridge network does not connect to the MESes using LAG, then
   only one of the links between a CE that is a switch and the MESes
   must be the active link. Procedures for supporting active-active
   points of attachments, when a bridge network does not connect to the
   MESes using LAG, are for further study.

   The granularity of the DF election MUST be at least the ethernet
   segment via which the CE is multi-homed to the MESes. If the DF
   election is done at the ethernet segment granularity then a single
   MES MUST be elected as the DF on the ethernet segment.

   If there are one or more Ethernet Tags (e.g., VLANs) on the ethernet
   segment then the granularity of the DF election SHOULD be the
   combination of the ethernet segment and Ethernet Tag on that ethernet
   segment. In this case the same MES MUST be elected as the DF for a
   particular Ethernet Tag on that ethernet segment.

   There are two specified mechanisms for performing DF election.

13.1. DF Election Performed by each MES

   The MESes perform a designated forwarder (DF) election, for an
   ethernet segment, or ethernet segment, Ethernet Tag combination using
   the Ethernet Tag A-D BGP route described in section "Auto-Discovery
   of Ethernet Tags on Ethernet Segments".

   The DF election for a particular ESI or a particular <ESI, Ethernet
   Tag> combination proceeds as follows. First a MES constructs a
   candidate list of MESes. This comprises all the Ethernet Tag A-D
   routes with that particular ESI or <ESI, Ethernet Tag> tuple that a
   MES imports in a E-VPN instance, including the Ethernet Tag A-D route
   generated by the MES itself, if any.  The DF MES is chosen from this
   candidate list. Note that DF election is carried out by all the MESes
   that import the DF route.

   The default procedure for choosing the DF is the MES with the highest
   IP address, of all the MESes in the candidate list. This procedure
   MUST be implemented. It ensures that except during routing transients
   each MES chooses the same DF MES for a given ESI and Ethernet Tag
   combination.

   Other alternative procedures for performing DF election are possible
   and will be described in the future.




13.2. DF Election Performed Only on Multi-Homed MESes

   As a MES discovers other MESs that are members of the same multi-
   homed segment, using Ethernet Segment Routes, it starts building an
   ordered list based on the originating MES IP addresses. This list is
   used to select a DF and a backup DF (BDF) on a per group of Ethernet
   Tag basis. For example, the MES with the numerically highest
   identifier is considered the DF for a given group of VLANs for that
   ethernet segment and the next MES in the list is considered the BDF.
   To that end, the range of Ethernet Tags associated with the CE must
   be partitioned into disjoint sets. The size of each set is a function
   of the total number of CE Ethernet Tags and the total number of MESs
   that the ethernet segment is multi-homed to. The DF can employ any
   distribution function that achieves an even distribution of Ethernet
   Tags across the MESes that are multi-homed to the ethernet segment.
   The DF takes over the Ethernet Tag set of any MES encountering either
   a node failure or a link/ethernet segment failure causing that MES to
   be isolated from the multi-homed segment. In case of a failure that
   is affecting the DF, then the BDF takes over the DF VLAN set.

Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   It should be noted that once all the MESs participating in an
   ethernet segment have the same ordered list for that site, then
   Ethernet Tag groups can be assigned to each member of that list
   deterministically without any need to explicitly distribute Ethernet
   Tags among the member MESs of that list. In other words, the DF
   election for a group of Ethernet Tags is a local matter and can be
   done deterministically. As an example, consider, that the ordered
   list consists of m MESs: (MES1, MES2,., MESm),  and there are n
   Ethernet Tags for that site (V0, V1, V2, ., Vn-1). Then MES1 and MES2
   can be the DF and the BDF respectively for all the Ethernet Tags
   corresponding to (i mod m) for i:1 to n. MES2 and MES3 can be the DF
   and the BDF respectively for all the Ethernet Tags corresponding to
   (i mod m) + 1 and so on till the last MES in the order list is
   reached. As a result MESm and MES1 is the DF and the BDF respectively
   for the all the VLANs corresponding to (i mod m) + m-1.



14. Handling of Multi-Destination Traffic

   Procedures are required for a given MES to send broadcast or
   multicast traffic, received from a CE encapsulated in a given
   Ethernet Tag in a E-VPN, to all the other MESes that span that
   Ethernet Tag in the E-VPN. In certain scenarios, described in section
   "Processing of Unknown Unicast Packets", a given MES may also need to
   flood unknown unicast traffic to other MESes.

   The MESes in a particular E-VPN may use ingress replication or P2MP
   LSPs or MP2MP LSPs to send unknown unicast, broadcast or multicast
   traffic to other MESes.

   Each MES MUST advertise an "Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route"
   to enable the above. Next section provides procedures to construct
   the Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag route. Subsequent sections
   describe in further detail its usage.


14.1. Construction of the Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route

   The RD MUST be the RD of the E-VPN instance that is advertising the
   NLRI. The procedures for setting the RD for a given E-VPN are
   described in section 10.1.1.

   The Ethernet Segment Identifier MAY be set to the eight octet ESI
   identifier described in section "Ethernet Segment Identifier". Or it
   MAY be set to 0.  It MUST be set to 0 if the Ethernet Tag is set to
   0.




raggarwa-sajassi, et.al.                                       [Page 23]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   The Ethernet Tag ID is the identifier of the Ethernet Tag. It MAY be
   set to 0 in which case an egress MES MUST perform a MAC lookup to
   forward the packet.

   The Originating Router's IP address MUST be set to an IP address of
   the PE.  This address SHOULD be common for all the MVIs on the PE
   (e.,g., this address may be PE's loopback address).

   The Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute of the route MUST
   be set to the same IP address as the one carried in the Originating
   Router's IP Address field.

   The BGP advertisement that advertises the Inclusive Multicast
   Ethernet Tag route MUST also carry one or more Route Target (RT)
   attributes. The assignemnt of RTs described in the section on
   "Constructing the BGP E-VPN MAC Address Advertisement" MUST be
   followed.


14.2. P-Tunnel Identification

   In order to identify the P-Tunnel used for sending broadcast, unknown
   unicast or multicast traffic, the Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag
   route MUST carry a "PMSI Tunnel Attribute" specified in [BGP MVPN].

   Depending on the technology used for the P-tunnel for the E-VPN on
   the PE, the PMSI Tunnel attribute of the Inclusive Multicast Ethernet
   Tag route is constructed as follows.

     + If the PE that originates the advertisement uses a P-Multicast
       tree for the P-tunnel for the E-VPN, the PMSI Tunnel attribute
       MUST contain the identity of the tree (note that the PE could
       create the identity of the tree prior to the actual instantiation
       of the tree).

     + A PE that uses a P-Multicast tree for the P-tunnel MAY aggregate
       two or more Ethernet Tags in the same or different E-VPNs present
       on the PE onto the same tree. In this case in addition to
       carrying the identity of the tree, the PMSI Tunnel attribute MUST
       carry an MPLS upstream assigned label which the PE has bound
       uniquely to the <ESI, Ethernet Tag> for E-VPN associated with
       this update (as determined by its RTs).

       If the PE has already advertised Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag
       routes for two or more Ethernet Tags that it now desires to
       aggregate, then the PE MUST re-advertise those routes. The re-
       advertised routes MUST be the same as the original ones, except
       for the PMSI Tunnel attribute and the label carried in that



raggarwa-sajassi, et.al.                                       [Page 24]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


       attribute.

     + If the PE that originates the advertisement uses ingress
       replication for the P-tunnel for the E-VPN, the route MUST
       include the PMSI Tunnel attribute with the Tunnel Type set to
       Ingress Replication and Tunnel Identifier set to a routable
       address of the PE. The PMSI Tunnel attribute MUST carry a
       downstream assigned MPLS label. This label is used to demultiplex
       the broadcast, multicast or unknown unicast E-VPN traffic
       received over a unicast tunnel by the PE.

     + The Leaf Information Required flag of the PMSI Tunnel attribute
       MUST be set to zero, and MUST be ignored on receipt.


14.3. Ethernet Segment Identifier and Ethernet Tag

   As described above the encoding rules allow setting the Ethernet
   Segment Identifier and Ethernet Tag to either valid values or to 0.
   If the Ethernet Tag is set to a valid value, then an egress MES can
   forward the packet to the set of egress ESIs in the Ethernet Tag, in
   the E-VPN, by performing a MPLS lookup alone. Further if the ESI is
   also set to non zero then the egress MES does not need to replicate
   the packet as it is destined for a given ethernet segment. If both
   Ethernet Tag and ESI are set to 0 then an egress MES MUST perform a
   MAC lookup in the MVI determined by the MPLS label, after the MPLS
   lookup, to forward the packet.

   If a MES advertises multiple Inclusive Ethernet Tag routes for a
   given E-VPN then the PMSI Tunnel Attributes for these routes MUST be
   distinct.


15. Processing of Unknown Unicast Packets

   The procedures in this document do not require MESes to flood unknown
   unicast traffic to other MESes. If MESes learn CE MAC addresses via a
   control plane, the MESes can then distribute MAC addresses via BGP,
   and all unicast MAC addresses will be learnt prior to traffic to
   those destinations.

   However, if a destination MAC address of a received packet is not
   known by the MES, the MES may have to flood the packet. Flooding must
   take into account "split horizon forwarding" as follows. The
   principles behind the following procedures are borrowed from the
   split horizon forwarding rules in VPLS solutions [RFC 4761, RFC
   4762].  When a MES capable of flooding (say MESx) receives a
   broadcast Ethernet frame, or one with an unknown destination MAC



raggarwa-sajassi, et.al.                                       [Page 25]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   address, it must flood the frame.  If the frame arrived from an
   attached CE, MESx must send a copy of the frame to every other
   attached CE, as well as to all other MESs participating in the E-VPN.
   If, on the other hand, the frame arrived from another MES (say MESy),
   MESx must send a copy of the packet only to attached CEs. MESx MUST
   NOT send the frame to other MESs, since MESy would have already done
   so. Split horizon forwarding rules apply to broadcast and multicast
   packets, as well as packets to an unknown MAC address.

   Whether or not to flood packets to unknown destination MAC addresses
   should be an administrative choice, depending on how learning happens
   between CEs and MESes.

   The MESes in a particular E-VPN may use ingress replication using
   RSVP-TE P2P LSPs or LDP MP2P LSPs for sending broadcast, multicast
   and unknown unicast traffic to other MESes. Or they may use RSVP-TE
   P2MP or LDP P2MP or LDP MP2MP LSPs for sending such traffic to other
   MESes.


15.1. Ingress Replication

   If ingress replication is in use, the P-Tunnel attribute, carried in
   the Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag routes for the E-VPN, specifies
   the downstream label that the other MESes can use to send unknown
   unicast, multicast or broadcast traffic for the E-VPN to this
   particular MES.

   The MES that receives a packet with this particular MPLS label MUST
   treat the packet as a broadcast, multicast or unknown unicast packet.
   Further if the MAC address is a unicast MAC address, the MES MUST
   treat the packet as an unknown unicast packet.


15.2. P2MP MPLS LSPs

   The procedures for using P2MP LSPs are very similar to VPLS
   procedures [VPLS-MCAST]. The P-Tunnel attribute used by a MES for
   sending unknown unicast, broadcast or multicast traffic for a
   particular ethernet segment, is advertised in the Inclusive Ethernet
   Tag Multicast route as described in section "Handling of Multi-
   Destination Traffic".

   The P-Tunnel attribute specifies the P2MP LSP identifier. This is the
   equivalent of an Inclusive tree in [VPLS-MCAST]. Note that multiple
   Ethernet Tags, which may be in different E-VPNs, may use the same
   P2MP LSP, using upstream labels [VPLS-MCAST]. When P2MP LSPs are used
   for flooding unknown unicast traffic, packet re-ordering is possible.



raggarwa-sajassi, et.al.                                       [Page 26]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   The MES that receives a packet on the P2MP LSP specified in the PMSI
   Tunnel Attribute MUST treat the packet as a broadcast, multicast or
   unknown unicast packet. Further if the MAC address is a unicast MAC
   address, the MES MUST treat the packet as an unknown unicast packet.


16. Forwarding Unicast Packets

16.1. Forwarding packets received from a CE

   When a MES receives a packet from a CE, on a given Ethernet Tag, it
   must first look up the source MAC address of the packet. In certain
   environments the source MAC address may be used to authenticate the
   CE and determine that traffic from the host can be allowed into the
   network.

   If the MES decides to forward the packet the destination MAC address
   of the packet must be looked up. If the MES has received MAC address
   advertisements for this destination MAC address from one or more
   other MESes or learned it from locally connected CEs, it is
   considered as a known MAC address. Else the MAC address is considered
   as an unknown MAC address.

   For known MAC addresses the MES forwards this packet to one of the
   remote MESes. The packet is encapsulated in the E-VPN MPLS label
   advertised by the remote MES, for that MAC address, and in the MPLS
   LSP label stack to reach the remote MES.

   If the MAC address is unknown then, if the administrative policy on
   the MES requires flooding of unknown unicast traffic:
       - The MES MUST flood the packet to other MESes. If the ESI over
   which the MES receives the packet is multi-homed, then the MES MUST
   first encapsulate the packet in the ESI MPLS label as described in
   section "Split Horizon". If ingress replication is used the packet
   MUST be replicated one or more times to each remote MES with the
   bottom label of the stack being a MPLS label determined as follows.
   This is the MPLS label advertised by the remote MES in a PMSI Tunnel
   Attribute in the Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag route for an <ESI,
   Ethernet Tag> combination. The Ethernet Tag in the route must be the
   same as the Ethernet Tag advertised by the ingress MES in its
   Ethernet Tag A-D route associated with the interface on which the
   ingress MES receives the packet. If P2MP LSPs are being used the
   packet MUST be sent on the P2MP LSP that the MES is the root of for
   the Ethernet Tag in the E-VPN. If the same P2MP LSP is used for all
   Ethernet Tags then all the MESes in the E-VPN MUST be the leaves of
   the P2MP LSP. If a distinct P2MP LSP is used for a given Ethernet Tag
   in the E-VPN then only the MESes in the Ethernet Tag MUST be the
   leaves of the P2MP LSP. The packet MUST be encapsulated in the P2MP

   LSP label stack.

   If the MAC address is unknown then, if the admnistrative policy on
   the MES does not allow flooding of unknown unicast traffic:
       - The MES MUST drop the packet.


16.2. Forwarding packets received from a remote MES

16.2.1. Unknown Unicast Forwarding

   When a MES receives a MPLS packet from a remote MES then, after
   processing the MPLS label stack, if the top MPLS label ends up being
   a P2MP LSP label associated with a E-VPN or the downstream label
   advertised in the P-Tunnel attribute and after performing the split
   horizon procedures described in section "Split Horizon":

        - If the MES is the designated forwarder of unknown unicast,
   broadcast or multicast traffic, on a particular set of ESIs for the
   Ethernet Tag, the default behavior is for the MES to flood the packet
   on the ESIs. In other words the default behavior is for the MES to
   assume that the destination MAC address is unknown unicast, broadcast
   or multicast and it is not required to do a destination MAC address
   lookup, as long as the granularity of the MPLS label included the
   Ethernet Tag. As an option the MES may do a destination MAC lookup to
   flood the packet to only a subset of the CE interfaces in the
   Ethernet Tag. For instance the MES may decide to not flood an unknown
   unicast packet on certain ethernet segments even if it is the DF on
   the ethernet segment, based on administrative policy.

       - If the MES is not the designated forwarder on any of the ESIs
   for the Ethernet Tag, the default behavior is for it to drop the
   packet.


16.2.2. Known Unicast Forwarding

   If the top MPLS label ends up being a E-VPN label that was advertised
   in the unicast MAC advertisements, then the MES either forwards the
   packet based on CE next-hop forwarding information associated with
   the label or does a destination MAC address lookup to forward the
   packet to a CE.

17. Split Horizon

   Consider a CE that is multi-homed to two or more MESes on an ethernet
   segment ES1. If the CE sends a multicast, broadcast or unknown
   unicast packet to a particular MES, say MES1, then MES1 will forward
   that packet to all or subset of the other MESes in the E-VPN. In this
   case the MESes, other than MES1, that the CE is multi-homed to MUST
   drop the packet and not forward back to the CE. This is referred to
   as "split horizon" in this document.

   In order to accomplish this each MES distributes to other MESes that
   are connected to the ethernet segment an "Ethernet Segment Route".



17.1. ESI MPLS Label: Ingress Replication

   An MES that is using ingress replication for sending broadcast,
   multicast or unknown unicast traffic, distributes to other MESes,
   that belong to the ethernet segment, a downstream assigned "ESI MPLS
   label" in the Ethernet Segment route. This label MUST be programmed
   in the platform label space by the advertising MES. Further the
   forwarding entry for this label must result in NOT forwarding packets
   received with this label onto the ethernet segment that the label was
   distributed for.

   Consider MES1 and MES2 that are multi-homed to CE1 on ES1. Further
   consider that MES1 is using P2P or MP2P LSPs to send packets to MES2.
   Consider that MES1 receives a a multicast, broadcast or unknown
   unicast packet from CE1 on VLAN1 on ESI1.

   First consider the case where MES2 distributes an unique Inclusive
   Multicast Ethernet Tag route for VLAN1, for each ethernet segment on
   MES2. In this case MES1 MUST NOT replicate the packet to MES2 for
   <ESI1, VLAN1>.

   Next consider the case where MES2 distributes a single Inclusive
   Multicast Ethernet Tag route for VLAN1 for all ethernet segments on
   MES2. In this case when MES1 sends a multicast, broadcast or unknown
   unicast packet, that it receives from CE1, it MUST first push onto
   the MPLS label stack the ESI label that MES2 has distributed for
   ESI1. It MUST then push on the MPLS label distributed by MES2 in the
   Inclusive Ethernet Tag Multicast route for Ethernet Tag1. The
   resulting packet is further encapsulated in the P2P or MP2P LSP label
   stack required to transmit the packet to MES2.  When MES2 receives
   this packet it determines the set of ESIs to replicate the packet to
   from the top MPLS label, after any P2P or MP2P LSP labels have been
   removed. If the next label is the ESI label assigned by MES2 then



raggarwa-sajassi, et.al.                                       [Page 29]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   MES2 MUST NOT forward the packet onto ESI1.



17.2. ESI MPLS Label: P2MP MPLS LSPs

   An MES that is using P2MP LSPs for sending broadcast, multicast or
   unknown unicast traffic, distributes to other MESes, that belong to
   the ethernet segment, an upstream assigned "ESI MPLS label" in the
   Ethernet Segment route. This label is upstream assigned by the MES
   that advertises the route. This label MUST be programmed by the other
   MESes, that are connected to the ESI advertised in the route, in the
   context label space for the advertising MES. Further the forwarding
   entry for this label must result in NOT forwarding packets received
   with this label onto the ethernet segment that the label was
   distributed for.

   Consider MES1 and MES2 that are multi-homed to CE1 on ES1. Further
   assume that MES1 is using P2MP MPLS LSPs to send broadcast, multicast
   or uknown unicast packets. When MES1 sends a multicast, broadcast or
   unknown unicast packet, that it receives from CE1, it MUST first push
   onto the MPLS label stack the ESI label that it has assigned for the
   ESI that the packet was received on. The resulting packet is further
   encapsulated in the P2MP MPLS label stack necessary to transmit the
   packet to the other MESes. Penultimate hop popping MUST be disabled
   on the P2MP LSPs used in the MPLS transport infrastructure for E-VPN.
   When MES2 receives this packet it decapsulates the top MPLS label and
   forwards the packet using the context label space determined by the
   top label. If the next label is the ESI label assigned by MES1 then
   MES2 MUST NOT forward the packet onto ESI1.



18. ESI MPLS Label: MP2MP LSPs

   The procedures for ESI MPLS Label assignment and usage for MP2MP LSPs
   will be described in the next version.

19. Load Balancing of Unicast Packets

   This section specifies how load balancing is achieved to/from a CE
   that has more than one interface that is directly connected to one or
   more MESes. The CE may be a host or a router or it may be a switched
   network that is connected via LAG to the MESes.


19.1. Load balancing of traffic from a MES to remote CEs

   Whenever a remote MES imports a MAC advertisement for a given <ESI,
   Ethernet Tag> in a E-VPN instance, it MUST consider the MAC as
   reachahable via all the MESes from which it has imported Ethernet Tag
   A-D routes for that <ESI, Ethernet Tag>. Further the remote MES MUST
   use these MAC advertisement and Ethernet Tag A-D routes to constuct
   the set of next-hops that it can use to send the packet to the
   destination MAC. Each next-hop comprises a MPLS label stack, that is
   to be used by the egress MES to forward the packet. This label stack
   is determined as follows. If the next-hop is constructed as a result
   of a MAC route which has a valid MPLS label stack, then this label
   stack MUST be used. However if the MAC route doesn't exist or if it
   doesn't have a valid MPLS label stack then the next-hop and MPLS
   label stack is constructed as a result of one or more corresponding
   Ethernet Tag A-D routes as follows. Note that the following
   description applies to determining the label stack for a particular
   next-hop to reach a given MES, from which the remote MES has received
   and imported one or more Ethernet Tag A-D routes that have the
   matching ESI and Ethernet Tag as the one present in the MAC
   advertisement.  The Ethernet Tag A-D routes mentioned in the
   following description refer to the ones imported from this given MES.

   If there is a corresponding Ethernet Tag A-D route for that <ESI,
   Ethernet Tag> then that label stack MUST be used. If such an Ethernet
   Tag A-D route doesn't exist but Ethernet Tag A-D routes exist for
   <ESI, Ethernet Tag = 0> and <ESI = 0, Ethernet Tag> then the label
   stack must be constructed by using the labels from these two routes.
   If this is not the case but an Ethernet Tag A-D route exists for
   <ESI, Ethernet Tag = 0> then the label from that route must be used.
   Finally if this is also not the case but an Ethernet Tag A-D route
   exists for <ESI = 0, Ethernet Tag = 0> then the label from that route
   must be used.

   The following example explains the above when Ethernet Tag A-D routes
   are advertised per <ESI, Ethernet Tag>.

   Consider a CE, CE1, that is dual homed to two MESes, MES1 and MES2 on
   a LAG interface, ES1, and is sending packets with MAC address MAC1 on
   VLAN1. Based on E-VPN extensions described in sections "Determining



raggarwa-sajassi, et.al.                                       [Page 31]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   Reachability of Unicast Addresses" and "Auto-Discovery of Ethernet
   Tags on Ethernet Segments", a remote MES say MES3 is able to learn
   that a MAC1 is reachable via MES1 and MES2. Both MES1 and MES2 may
   advertise MAC1 in BGP if they receive packets with MAC1 from CE1. If
   this is not the case and if MAC1 is advertised only by MES1, MES3
   still considers MAC1 as reachable via both MES1 and MES2 as both MES1
   and MES2 advertise a Ethernet Tag A-D route for <ESI1, VLAN1>.

   The MPLS label stack to send the packets to MES1 is the MPLS LSP
   stack to get to MES1 and the E-VPN label advertised by MES1 for CE1's
   MAC.

   The MPLS label stack to send packets to MES2 is the MPLS LSP stack to
   get to MES2 and the MPLS label in the Ethernet Tag A-D route
   advertised by MES2 for <ES1, VLAN1>, if MES2 has not advertised MAC1
   in BGP.

   We will refer to these label stacks as MPLS next-hops.

   The remote MES, MES3, can now load balance the traffic it receives
   from its CEs, destined for CE1, between MES1 and MES2.  MES3 may use
   the IP flow information for it to hash into one of the MPLS next-hops
   for load balancing for IP traffic. Or MES3 may rely on the source and
   destination MAC addresses for load balancing.

   Note that once MES3 decides to send a particular packet to MES1 or
   MES2 it can pick from more than path to reach the particular remote
   MES using regular MPLS procedures. For instance if the tunneling
   technology is based on RSVP-TE LSPs, and MES3 decides to send a
   particular packet to MES1 then MES3 can choose from multiple RSVP-TE
   LSPs that have MES1 as their destination.

   When MES1 or MES2 receive the packet destined for CE1 from MES3, if
   the packet is a unicast MAC packet it is forwarded to CE1.  If it is
   a multicast or broadcast MAC packet then only one of MES1 or MES2
   must forward the packet to the CE. Which of MES1 or MES2 forward this
   packet to the CE is determined by default based on which of the two
   is the DF. An alternate procedure to load balance multicast packets
   will be described in the future.

   If the connectivity between the multi-homed CE and one of the MESes
   that it is multi-homed to fails, the MES MUST withdraw the MAC
   address from BGP.  This enables the remote MESes to remove the MPLS
   next-hop to this particular MES from the set of MPLS next-hops that
   can be used to forward traffic to the CE. For further details and
   procedures on withdrawl of E-VPN route types in the event of MES to
   CE failures please section "MES to CE Network Failures".

19.2. Load balancing of traffic between a MES and a local CE

   A CE may be configured with more than one interface connected to
   different MESes or the same MES for load balancing. The MES(s) and
   the CE can load balance traffic onto these interfaces using one of
   the following mechanisms.


19.2.1. Data plane learning

   Consider that the MESes perform data plane learning for local MAC
   addresses learned from local CEs. This enables the MES(s) to learn a
   particular MAC address and associate it with one or more interfaces.
   The MESes can now load balance traffic destined to that MAC address
   on the multiple interfaces.

   Whether the CE can load balance traffic that it generates on the
   multiple interfaces is dependent on the CE implementation.


19.2.2. Control plane learning

   The CE can be a host that advertises the same MAC address using a
   control protocol on both interfaces. This enables the MES(s) to learn
   the host's MAC address and associate it with one or more interfaces.
   The MESes can now load balance traffic destined to the host on the
   multiple interfaces. The host can also load balance the traffic it
   generates onto these interfaces and the MES that receives the traffic
   employs E-VPN forwarding procedures to forward the traffic.


20. MAC Moves

   In the case where a CE is a host or a switched network connected to
   hosts, the MAC address that is reachable via a given MES on a
   particular ESI may move such that it becomes reachable via another
   MES on another ESI.  This is referred to as a "MAC Move".

   Remote MESes must be able to distinguish a MAC move from the case
   where a MAC address on an ESI is reachable via two different MESes
   and load balancing is performed as described in section "Load
   Balancing of Unicast Packets".  This distinction can be made as
   follows. If a MAC is learned by a particular MES from multiple MESes,
   then the MES performs load balancing only amongst the set of MESes
   that advertised the MAC with the same ESI. If this is not the case
   then the MES chooses only one of the advertising MESes to reach the
   MAC as per BGP path selection.




raggarwa-sajassi, et.al.                                       [Page 33]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   There can be traffic loss during a MAC move. Consider MAC1 that is
   advertised by MES1 and learned from CE1 on ESI1. If MAC1 now moves
   behind MES2, on ESI2, MES2 advertises the MAC in BGP. Until a remote
   MES, MES3, determines that the best path is via MES2, it will
   continue to send traffic destined for MAC1 to MES1. This will not
   occur deterministially until MES1 withdraws the advertisement for
   MAC1.

   One recommended optimization to reduce the traffic loss during MAC
   moves is the following option. When an MES sees a MAC update from a
   CE on an ESI, which is different from the ESI on which the MES has
   currently learned the MAC, the corresponding entry in the local
   bridge forwarding table SHOULD be immediately purged causing the MES
   to withdraw its own E-VPN MAC advertisement route and replace it with
   the update.

   A future version of this specification will describe other optimized
   procedures to minimize traffic loss during MAC moves.


21. Multicast

   The MESes in a particular E-VPN may use ingress replication or P2MP
   LSPs to send multicast traffic to other MESes.


21.1. Ingress Replication

   The MESes may use ingress replication for flooding unknown unicast,
   multicast or broadcast traffic as described in section "Handling of
   Multi-Destination Traffic". A given unknown unicast or broadcast
   packet must be sent to all the remote MESes. However a given
   multicast packet for a multicast flow may be sent to only a subset of
   the MESes. Specifically a given multicast flow may be sent to only
   those MESes that have receivers that are interested in the multicast
   flow. Determining which of the MESes have receivers for a given
   multicast flow is done using explicit tracking described below.


21.2. P2MP LSPs

   A MES may use an "Inclusive" tree for sending an unknown unicast,
   broadcast or multicast packet or a "Selective" tree. This terminology
   is borrowed from [VPLS-MCAST].

   A variety of transport technologies may be used in the SP network.
   For inclusive P-Multicast trees, these transport technologies include
   point-to-multipoint LSPs created by RSVP-TE or mLDP. For selective P-

Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   Multicast trees, only unicast MES-MES tunnels (using MPLS or IP/GRE
   encapsulation) and P2MP LSPs are supported, and the supported P2MP
   LSP signaling protocols are RSVP-TE, and mLDP.


21.3. MP2MP LSPs

   The root of the MP2MP LDP LSP advertises the Inclusive Multicast Tag
   route with the PMSI Tunnel attribute set to the MP2MP Tunnel
   identifier.  This advertisement is then sent to all MESes in the
   EVPN.  Upon receiving the Inclusive Multicast Tag routes with a PMSI
   Tunnel attribute that contains the MP2MP Tunnel identifier, the
   receiving MESes initiate the setup of the MP2MP tunnel towards the
   root using the procedures in [MLDP].


21.3.1. Inclusive Trees

    An Inclusive Tree allows the use of a single multicast distribution
   tree, referred to as an Inclusive P-Multicast tree, in the SP network
   to carry all the multicast traffic from a specified set of E-VPN
   instances on a given MES. A particular P-Multicast tree can be set up
   to carry the traffic originated by sites belonging to a single E-VPN,
   or to carry the traffic originated by sites belonging to different E-
   VPNs. The ability to carry the traffic of more than one E-VPN on the
   same tree is termed 'Aggregation'. The tree needs to include every
   MES that is a member of any of the E-VPNs that are using the tree.
   This implies that a MES may receive multicast traffic for a multicast
   stream even if it doesn't have any receivers that are interested in
   receiving traffic for that stream.

   An Inclusive P-Multicast tree as defined in this document is a P2MP
   tree.  A P2MP tree is used to carry traffic only for E-VPN CEs that
   are connected to the MES that is the root of the tree.

   The procedures for signaling an Inclusive Tree are the same as those
   in [VPLS-MCAST] with the VPLS-AD route replaced with the Inclusive
   Multicast Ethernet Tag route. The P-Tunnel attribute [VPLS-MCAST] for
   an Inclusive tree is advertised in the Inclusive Ethernet Tag A-D
   route as described in section "Handling of Multi-Destination
   Traffic".  Note that a MES can "aggregate" multiple inclusive trees
   for different E-VPNs on the same P2MP LSP using upstream labels. The
   procedures for aggregation are the same as those described in [VPLS-
   MCAST], with VPLS A-D routes replaced by E-VPN Inclusive Multicast
   Ethernet Tag A-D routes.

21.3.2. Selective Trees

   A Selective P-Multicast tree is used by a MES to send IP multicast
   traffic for one or IP more specific multicast streams, originated by
   CEs connected to the MES, that belong to the same or different E-
   VPNs, to a subset of the MESs that belong to those E-VPNs. Each of
   the MESs in the subset should be on the path to a receiver of one or
   more multicast streams that are mapped onto the tree. The ability to
   use the same tree for multicast streams that belong to different E-
   VPNs is termed a MES the ability to create separate SP multicast
   trees for specific multicast streams, e.g. high bandwidth multicast
   streams. This allows traffic for these multicast streams to reach
   only those MES routers that have receivers in these streams. This
   avoids flooding other MES routers in the E-VPN.

   A SP can use both Inclusive P-Multicast trees and Selective P-
   Multicast trees or either of them for a given E-VPN on a MES, based
   on local configuration.

   The granularity of a selective tree is <RD, MES, S, G> where S is an
   IP multicast source address and G is an IP multicast group address or
   G is a multicast MAC address. Wildcard sources and wildcard groups
   are supported. Selective trees require explicit tracking as described
   below.

   A E-VPN MES advertises a selective tree using a E-VPN selective A-D
   route. The procedures are the same as those in [VPLS-MCAST] with S-
   PMSI A-D routes in [VPLS-MCAST] replaced by E-VPN Selective A-D
   routes. The information elements of the E-VPN selective
    A-D route are similar to those of the VPLS S-PMSI A-D route with the
   following differences. A E-VPN Selective A-D route includes an
   optional Ethernet Tag field. Also a E-VPN selective A-D route may
   encode a MAC address in the Group field. The encoding details of the
   E-VPN selective A-D route will be described in the next revision.

   Selective trees can also be aggregated on the same P2MP LSP using
   aggregation as described in [VPLS-MCAST].


21.4. Explicit Tracking

   [VPLS-MCAST] describes procedures for explicit tracking that rely on
   Leaf A-D routes. The same procedures are used for explicit tracking
   in this specification with VPLS Leaf A-D routes replaced with E-VPN
   Leaf A-D routes.  These procedures allow a root MES to request
   multicast membership information for a given (S, G), from leaf MESs.
   Leaf MESs rely on IGMP snooping or PIM snooping between the MES and
   the CE to determine the multicast membership information. Note that

Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   the procedures in [VPLS-MCAST] do not describe how explicit tracking
   is performed if the CEs are enabled with join suppression. The
   procedures for this case will be described in a future version.


22. Convergence

   This section describes failure recovery from different types of
   network failures.


22.1. Transit Link and Node Failures between MESes

   The use of existing MPLS Fast-Reroute mechanisms can provide failure
   recovery in the order of 50ms, in the event of transit link and node
   failures in the infrastructure that connects the MESes.


22.2. MES Failures

   Consider a host host1 that is dual homed to MES1 and MES2. If MES1
   fails, a remote MES, MES3, can discover this based on the failure of
   the BGP session.  This failure detection can be in the sub-second
   range if BFD is used to detect BGP session failure. MES3 can update
   its forwarding state to start sending all traffic for host1 to only
   MES2. It is to be noted that this failure recovery is potentially
   faster than what would be possible if data plane learning were to be
   used. As in that case MES3 would have to rely on re-learning of MAC
   addresses via MES2.


22.2.1. Local Repair

   It is possible to perform local repair in the case of MES failures.
   Details will be specified in the future.


22.3. MES to CE Network Failures

   When an ethernet segment connected to a MES fails or when a Ethernet
   Tag is deconfigured on an ethernet segment, then the MES MUST
   withdraw the Ethernet Tag A-D route(s) announced for the <ESI,
   Ethernet Tags> that are impacted by the failure or de-configuration.
   In addition the MES MUST also withdraw the MAC advertisement routes
   that are impacted by the failure or de-configuration.

   The Ethernet Tag A-D routes should be used by an implementation to
   optimize the withdrawal of MAC advertisement routes. When a MES

Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   receives a withdrawl of a particular Ethernet Tag A-D route it SHOULD
   consider all the MAC advertisement routes, that are learned from the
   same <ESI, Ethernet Tag> as in the Ethernet Tag A-D route, as having
   been withdrawn. This optimizes the network convergence times in the
   event of MES to CE failures.


23. LACP State Synchronization

   This section requires review and discussion amongst the authors and
   will be revised in the next version.

   To support CE multi-homing with multi-chassis Ethernet bundles, the
   MESes connected to a given CE should synchronize [802.1AX] LACP state
   amongst each other. This ensures that the MESes can present a single
   LACP bundle to the CE. This is required for initial system bring-up
   and upon any configuration change.

   This includes at least the following LACP specific configuration
   parameters:


   - System Identifier (MAC Address): uniquely identifies a LACP speaker.
   - System Priority: determines which LACP speaker's port priorities are
   used in the Selection logic.
   - Aggregator Identifier: uniquely identifies a bundle within a LACP
   speaker.
   - Aggregator MAC Address: identifies the MAC address of the bundle.
   - Aggregator Key: used to determine which ports can join an Aggregator.
   - Port Number: uniquely identifies an interface within a LACP speaker.
   - Port Key: determines the set of ports that can be bundled.
   - Port Priority: determines a port's precedence level to join a bundle
   in case the number of eligible ports exceeds the maximum number of links
   allowed in a bundle.


   Furthermore, the MESes should also synchronize operational (run-time)
   data, in order for the LACP Selection logic state-machines to
   execute. This operational data includes the following LACP
   operational parameters, on a per port basis:


   - Partner System Identifier: this is the CE System MAC address.
   - Partner System Priority: the CE LACP System Priority
   - Partner Port Number: CE's AC port number.
   - Partner Port Priority: CE's AC Port Priority.
   - Partner Key: CE's key for this AC.
   - Partner State: CE's LACP State for the AC.



raggarwa-sajassi, et.al.                                       [Page 38]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-00.txt    October 2010


   - Actor State: PE's LACP State for the AC.
   - Port State: PE's AC port status.


   The above state needs to be communicated between MESes  forming a
   multi-chassis bundle during LACP initial bringup, upon any
   configuration change and upon the occurrence of a failure.

   It should be noted that the above configuration and operational state
   is localized in scope and is only relevant to MESes which connect to
   the same multi-homed CE over a given Ethernet bundle.

   Furthermore, the communication of state changes, upon failures, must
   occur with minimal latency, in order to minimize the switchover time
   and consequent service disruption. The protocol details for
   synchronizing the LACP state will be described in the following
   version.
