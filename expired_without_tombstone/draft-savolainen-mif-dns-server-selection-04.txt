          Improved DNS Server Selection for Multi-Homed Nodes
              draft-savolainen-mif-dns-server-selection-04

Abstract

   A multi-homed node can be connected to multiple networks that may
   utilize different DNS namespaces.  The node often receives DNS server
   configuration information from all connected networks.  Some of the
   DNS servers may have information about namespaces other servers do
   not have.  When the multi-homed node needs to utilize DNS, it has to
   choose which of the servers to contact to.  This document describes a
   policy based method for selecting DNS server for both forward and
   reverse DNS lookup procedures with help of DNS suffix and IPv6 prefix
   information received via DHCPv6.

1.  Introduction

   A multi-homed node faces several problems over single-homed node as
   is described in [I-D.ietf-mif-problem-statement].  This document
   studies in detail the problems local namespaces may cause for multi-
   homed nodes in the IPv4 and IPv6 domains and provides a solution.
   The node may be implemented as a host, or as a router such as
   Consumer Premises Equipment.

   When multiple namespaces are visible for a node, some DNS servers
   have information other servers do not have.  Because of that, a
   multi-homed node cannot assume every DNS server is able to provide
   any piece of information, but instead the node must be able to ask
   right server for the information it needs.

   An example of an application that benefits from multi-homing is a web
   browser that commonly accesses many different destinations and should
   be able to dynamically communicate over different network interfaces.

   However, as the IPv4 is being phased out and often uses NATs to
   achieve similar functions, this document describes a solution only
   for the IPv6 domain.

   In deployments where multiple namespaces are present, selection of
   the correct destination and source addresses for the actual IP
   connection is usually crucial as well, as the resolved destination's
   IP address may be only usable on the network interface over which it
   was resolved on.  Hence solution described in this document is
   assumed to be often used in combination of tools delivering source
   and destination address selection policies.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Problem description for local namespaces with multi-homed nodes

   This chapter describes two host multi-homing related local namespace
   scenarios for which the procedure described in chapter 3 provides a
   solution.  Essentially the same challenges may be faced by Consumer
   Premises Equipment as is described in
   [I-D.troan-multihoming-without-nat66].

2.1.  Fully qualified domain names with limited scopes

   A multi-homed host may be connecting to one or more networks that are
   using local namespaces.  As an example, the host may have
   simultaneously open a wireless LAN (WLAN) connection to public
   Internet, cellular connection to an operator network, and a virtual
   private network (VPN) connection to a corporate network.  When an
   application initiates a connection establishment to an FQDN, the host
   needs to be able to choose the right network interface for making a
   successful DNS query.  This is illustrated in the figure 1.  An FQDN
   for a public name can be resolved with any DNS server of any network
   interface, but for an FQDN of corporation's or operator's service's
   local name the host would need to be able to correctly select the
   right network interface for the DNS resolution, i.e. do interface
   selection already before destination's IP address is known.

2.2.  Network interface specific IP addresses

   In the second problem an FQDN as such is valid and resolvable via
   different network interfaces, but to different and not necessarily
   globally reachable IP addresses, as is illustrated in the figure 2.
   This is a problem when a host is single-homed, but for multi-homed
   host this results in additional challenges: the host's source and

   destination address selection mechanism must ensure the destination's
   IP address is only used in combination with source IP addresses of

                                 Figure 2

   Similar situation can happen when IPv6 protocol translation is used
   in combination with AAAA record synthesis proceduce
   [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64].  A synthesised AAAA record is guaranteed to
   be valid only on a network interface it was synthesized on.  Figure 3
   illustrates a scenario where the peer's IPv4 address is synthesized
   into different IPv6 addresses by DNS servers A and B. The same
   problem can happen in the IPv4 domain as well if A record synthesis
   is done, for example as described in Bump-In-the-Stack [RFC2767].

   For a related problem for dual-stack hosts in a network with DNS64,
   where IPv4 should be prioritized over synthesized IPv6, please see
   [I-D.wing-behave-dns64-config].

       AAAA synthesis results in interface specific IPv6 addresses.

                                 Figure 3

   A more complex scenario is an FQDN, which in addition to resolving
   into network interface specific IP addresses, identifies on different
   network interfaces completely different peer entities with
   potentially different set of service offering.  In even more complex
   scenario, an FQDN identifies unique peer entity, but one that
   provides different services on its different network interfaces.  The
   solution described in this document is not able to tackle these
   higher layer issues.  In fact, some of the problems may be solvable
   only by user intervention.

   A thing worth noting is that interface specific IP addresses can
   cause problems also for a single-homed host, if the host retains its
   DNS cache during movement from one network interface to another.
   After the interface change a host could have both positive and
   negative DNS cache entries invalid for the new network interface.
   Because of this the cached DNS information should be considered
   network interface local instead of node global.


3.  Improved DNS server selection procedure

   This chapter documents a procedure a (stub / proxy) resolver may
   utilize for DNS server selection in face of multiple namespaces.

   Essentially, the resolver shall dynamically build for each DNS query
   a priority list of DNS servers it will try to contact to.  The
   resolver shall cycle through the list until a positive reply is
   received, or until all selected DNS servers have been contacted or
   timed out.  (DISCUSS: What about those DNS servers that instead of
   negative answer always return positive reply with an IP address of
   some default HTTP server, which purpose is just to say 'authenticate'



Savolainen & Kato        Expires March 21, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        MIF and DNS server selection        September 2010


   or 'page not found'?  Maybe DNSSEC would help here, i.e. roll through
   DNS servers until one provides a response that can be validated?)

   To prioritize DNS servers in an optimal way, the resolver should ask
   with DHCPv6 which DNS servers are most likely able to successfully
   serve forward lookup requests matching to specific DNS suffixes or
   reverse (PTR record) lookup requests matching to specific IPv6
   prefixes.

   A resolver lacking more explicit information shall assume that all
   information is available from any DNS server of any network
   interface.

   Additionally, the resolver may utilize any other information it may
   have, e.g. possible user's preferences, node's general preferences
   between network interfaces, differences on trust levels of network
   interfaces (see Security Considerations), or any other piece of
   information.

   When a resource record is to be resolved, the resolver MUST give
   highest precedence to the DNS servers explicitly known to serve
   matching suffixes or prefixes.  A node may need to remember the
   interface used for successfuly query in order to be able to improve
   source address selection.

   For the scenario where an FQDN maps to same service but different IP
   addresses on different network interfaces, the source address
   selection algorithm must be able to pick a source address from the
   network interface that was used for DNS resolution.

   When local namespace are present a negative reply from a DNS server
   implies only that the particular DNS server was not able to serve the
   query.  However, it is not probable that the secondary DNS servers on
   the same network interface, on a same administrative domain, would be
   able to serve either.  Therefore, the next DNS server resolver
   contacts should be from another network interface.

3.1.  DNS server selection option

   A DHCPv6 option described below is used to inform nodes which DNS
   server should be contacted when initiating forward or reverse DNS
   lookup procedures.

               capability to resolve global names. Lack of "."

               information. Prefixes for reverse mapping are encoded as

   related DNS server has particular knowledge of (i.e.. local
   namespaces).  The option can occur multiple times in a single DHCPv6
   message, if multiple DNS servers are to be configured.

   A node can prioritize DNS servers with help of preference field.

   IPv6 prefixes should cover all the DNS suffixes configured in this
   option.  Prefixes should be as long as possible to avoid collision
   with information received on other option instances or with options
   received from DHCPv6 servers of other network interfaces.
   Overlapping IPv6 prefixes are interpreted by a node so that the
   resolver can use multiple DNS servers for queries mathing the
   prefixes.

   As the DNS options of [RFC3646], the OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT option
   MUST NOT appear in any other than the following messages: Solicit,
   Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind, Information-Request, and Reply.

   For backwards compatibility reasons the DHCPv6 message containing
   OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT also likely contains OPTION_DNS_SERVERS
   option.  In case both options contain the same IPv6 addresses, only
   one copy of the IPv6 address of DNS server shall be added to the DNS
   server list.

   In the case of a DNS server replying negatively to a question having
   matching suffix, it will be for implementation to decide whether to
   consider that as a final response, or whether to ask also from other
   DNS servers.  The implementation decision may be based, for example,
   on deployment or trust models.

   interfaces for parallel usage and learns DNS suffix and prefix
   information from DHCPv6 servers.

   2.  The node obtains DNS suffix and IPv6 prefix information for the
       new interface 1 from DHCPv6 server

   3.  The node stores the learned DNS suffixes and IPv6 prefixes for
       later use

   4.  The node opens its seconds network interface 2

   5.  The node obtains DNS suffix, say 'example.com', and IPv6 prefix
       information, say '8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa' for the new interface

             Example on choosing interface based on DNS suffix

                                 Figure 6

   Flow explanations:

   1.  An application makes a request for resolving an FQDN, e.g.
       'private.example.com'

   2.  A node creates list of DNS servers to contact to and uses
       configured DNS server information and stored DNS suffix
       information on priorization decisions.

   3.  The node has chosen interface 2, as from DHCPv6 it was learned
       earlier that the interface 2 has DNS suffix 'example.com'.  The
       node then resolves the requested name using interface 2's DNS
       server to an IPv6 address

   4.  The node replies to application with the resolved IPv6 address

5.  Scalability considerations

   The size limitations of DHCPv6 messages limit the number of suffixes
   and prefixes that can be carried in a configuration option.
   Including the suffixes and prefixes in a DHCPv6 option is best suited
   for deployments where relatively few carefully selected suffixes and
   prefixes are adequate.


6.  Considerations for network administrators

   Network administrators deploying private namespaces should assist
   advanced hosts in the DNS server selection by providing information
   described in this memo for nodes.  To ensure nodes' source and
   destination IP address selection also works correctly, network
   administrators should also deploy related technologies for that
   purpose.

   The solution described herein is best for selecting a DNS server
   having knowledge of some namespaces.  The solution is not able to
   make the right decision in a scenario where same name points to
   different services on different network interfaces.  Network
   administrators are recommended to avoid overloading of namespaces in
   such manner.

   network by advertising DNS suffixes and prefixes attacker wishes to
   intercept or deny service of.  The node's security should not be
   based on correct functionality of DNS server selection.  Use of
   DNSSEC is recommended to mitigates risks of forgery.

   Additionally nodes may employ heuristics to more wisely prioritize
   network interfaces with conflicting policies.  The prioritization
   may, for example, be based on trust level of a network interface over
   which policy was learned from.  To avoid problem of attacker
   advertising suffix with wide scope (such as .com) or intentionally
   narrow scope (such as mail.example.com), the node may want to first
   match suffixes of highest priority interface and if such match is
   found, consider information from other interface as lower priority.

9.1.  Suffix matching example

   In this example a host has three interfaces (in decreasing order of
   priority):

   1.  Managed tunnel interfaces (such as VPN) considered most
       trustworthy.  Advertises suffix 'example.com'

   2.  Cellular network advertising default suffix '.'

   3.  WLAN hotspot with attacker advertising suffixes
       'mail.example.com' and '.com'

   When a host resolves name 'mail.example.com', it will notice the
   highest priority interface has matching non-default suffix.  As the
   'example.com' matches to 'mail.example.com', the tunnel interface
   will be used.  Simple longest matching or shortest matching rules
   would have resulted in the host using attackers network.

   When a host resolves name 'example2.com', it will find highest
   matching non-default prefix from WLAN hotspot.  While it would have
   been safer to use cellular network's DNS server, security level is
   not decreased from what any single interface node would have.

   The multi-homed host may also choose to always use the most
   trustworthy interface it has for DNS queries.

Appendix A.  Best Current Practice for DNS server selection

   On some split-DNS deployments explicit policies for DNS server
   selection are not available.  This section describes ways for hosts
   to mitigate the problem by utilizing possibly existing indirect
   information elements as hints.  The approach to ask everything from
   everyone remains always as last resort option.

A.1.  Search list option for DNS forward lookup decisions

   A host can learn the special DNS suffixes of attached network
   interfaces from DHCP search list options; DHCPv4 Domain Search Option
   number 119 [RFC3397] and DHCPv6 Domain Search List Option number 24
   [RFC3646].  The host behavior is very similar as is illustrated in
   the example at section 3.3.  While these DHCP options are not
   intented to be used in DNS server selection, they may be used by the
   host for smart DNS server prioritization purposes in order to
   increase likelyhood of fast and successful DNS query.

   Overloading of existing DNS search list options is not without
   problems: resolvers would obviously use the DNS suffixes learned from
   search lists also for name resolution purposes.  This may not be a
   problem in deployments where DNS search list options contain few DNS
   suffixes like 'example.com, private.example.com', but can become a
   problem if many suffixes are configured.

A.2.  More specific routes for reverse lookup decision

   [RFC4191] defines how more specific routes can be provisioned for
   hosts.  This information is not intented to be used in DNS server
   selection, but nevertheless a host can use this information as a hint
   about which interface would be best to try first for reverse lookup
   procedures.  A DNS server configured via the same interface as more
   specific routes is likely more capable to answer reverse lookup
   questions than DNS server of an another interface.  The likelyhood of
   success is possibly higher if DNS server address is received in the
   same RA [RFC5006] as the more specific route information.

A.3.  Longest matching prefix for reverse lookup decision

   A host may utilize the longest matching prefix approach when deciding
   which DNS server to contact for reverse lookup purposes.  Namely, the
   host may send a DNS query to a DNS server learned over an interface

   having longest matching prefix to the address being queried.  This
   approach can help in cases where ULA [RFC4193] addresses are used and
   when the queried address belongs to a host or server within the same
   network (for example intranet).
