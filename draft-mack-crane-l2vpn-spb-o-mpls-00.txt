1. Introduction

   The IEEE Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) standard [802.1aq] provides
   optimal pair-wise data frame forwarding with little or no
   configuration in multi-hop networks of arbitrary topology. This
   network behavior is implemented by Shortest Path Tree (SPT) Bridges
   that automatically confederate (i.e., recognize compatibly
   configured neighbors) to form SPT Regions within which shortest path
   bridging is provided. The data plane controlled by SPT Bridges is
   unchanged from earlier bridging standards except for the addition of
   a reverse path forwarding check option. The ECMP project [802.1Qbp]
   will add support for multipath load spreading for both unicast and
   multicast traffic. SPB enables a new method to construct enterprise
   and cloud data center networks.

   This document describes use cases for SPB over an MPLS Packet
   Switched Network (PSN) and introduces a new hierarchical L2VPN
   architecture that uses SPB and IP/MPLS and documents the related

   configurations and references for proper interworking. In the use
   cases described the SPBM mode (MAC address based) is used, implying
   the existence of a Provider Backbone Edge Bridge function (MAC-in-
   MAC encapsulation) [802.1Q] at the boundary of the SPT Region.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. Use Cases

   SPT Regions at different locations may be interconnected by networks
   that are implemented with different technologies to form one larger
   SPT Region. This section describes use cases assuming that IP/MPLS
   technology is available. From the MPLS network view, SPT Bridges act
   as Customer Edge (CE) devices and connect to PEs via an attachment
   circuit (AC). SPT Bridges [802.1aq] support deterministic forwarding
   behavior over point-to-point links. Section 2.1 describes SPT Region
   interconnection over a single point-to-point link provided by an
   MPLS network. Section 2.2 describes interconnecting multiple SPT
   Regions using multiple PWs. Section 2.3 introduces a hierarchical
   L2VPN solution that uses SPT Bridges and MPLS in a tiered
   architecture.

2.1. Point-To-Point Interconnection

   Two SPT Bridges are interconnected by either an Ethernet or PPP PW
   over a MPLS network. The PW is configured between a pair of PEs to
   provide part of the point-to-point link between two SPT Bridges.
   Figure 1 illustrates this architecture. Each SPT Bridge connects to
   a PE via an AC and acts as a CE device. The MPLS PSN is bounded by
   the PEs. The link across the IP/MPLS PSN enables the site A and site
   B SPT Bridges to form one SPT Region.

   MPLS supports many pseudo wire transport encapsulations [RFC4446].
   Two types of links between Bridges have been standardized: Ethernet
   [RFC4448] and PPP [RFC3518, RFC4618]. A Bridge port connected to an
   AC may be mapped to a PW with Ethernet encapsulation [RFC4448]. The
   PW between two PEs can be auto-configured [RFC4447] or manually
   configured; the two Bridges then appear directly interconnected with
   an Ethernet link.

   When the Bridge ports connected to the ACs are configured with PPP,
   the PEs may be configured as a PW with PPP encapsulation [RFC4618].
   After the PW is established between two PEs, the two RBridges then
   appear directly interconnected with a PPP link. Because the frames
   between the bridges are encapsulated within PPP, if the PEs have the
   capability to add or remove PPP encapsulation, it is an independent
   decision for each AC and for the PW whether each is PPP or Ethernet.

   An SPB adjacency is automatically established over an Ethernet link
   or PPP link. The PW provides transparent transport between ACs.

   Note: For Ethernet PW configuration, PE SHOULD use the raw mode and
   non-service-delimiting options.

   As networks converge, it is possible that one operator controls both
   the SPT Region as well as the core MPLS network. Figure 2
   illustrates this use case, in which SPT Bridges are also MPLS PE
   enabled. The interworking between the SPT network and the MPLS PSN
   is within one device. In this case, a virtual Ethernet interface is
   configured between the SPT Bridge component and PE component on the
   SPT/PE device and a Packet-PW is configured between two PE
   components on two devices to emulate the virtual Ethernet link. An
   SPB adjacency is established between two RB/PE devices after the PW
   is established. In this case, SPB runs in the client layer and MPLS
   runs in the Server Layer; SPB/PE devices support both client and
   server layer control plane and data plane functions.

            Figure 2 P2P SPB-Link over IP/MPLS PSN Use Case II

   In both case I and II, the PE treats an SPT Bridge as a generic CE
   and has no awareness of SPB capability on the CE. Use case I enables
   the business models when the SPT Region and Core MPLS may be
   operated by different operators or the same operator. In the case of
   different operators, the core MPLS operator can sell a VPWS service
   to the SPB operator. Use case II provides the model where the SPT
   Region and the core network are operated by the same operator but
   use different technologies in edge and core domains of the network.

   A PW may cross multiple MPLS domains [RFC5659]. In this case, SPT
   Bridges connect to T-PEs and it works in the same way as single
   domain.

2.2. Multiple Interconnections

   More than two SPT sites may be interconnected by a full or partial
   mesh of PWs. The PWs provide a set of links interconnecting the SPT
   sites and enable the formation of one SPT Region. Interconnecting

   multiple sites using PWs is preferable to using a VPLS (VLAN)
   service because it allows deterministic control of traffic placement
   and traffic engineering (assuming the PWs provide a bandwidth SLA).

   PWs can provide multiple connections to a single physical interface
   if VLAN tags are used for service selection (Ethernet VLAN ACs).
   Virtual ports can be provisioned on the SPT Bridge by using a port-
   mapping S-VLAN component [802.1Qbc]. The S-VID is then used for
   service selection to map traffic to each PW connection. Figure 3
   shows the use of PWs to interconnect three SPT Bridges. One SPT
   Region is formed across three different sites. Three PWs are
   configured, providing a full mesh between the three sites. Each SPT
   site connects to the others via PWs selected by the service-
   delimiting S-VID on the AC.  So in this use case the PEs should use
   raw mode with service-delimiting.

   The scenario in Figure 3 can also be applied to interconnect
   multiple SPT Bridges when a device serves both SPT Bridge and PE
   functions. This use case is addressed in the following section.

   Note: If CEs at a site happen to be regular C-VLAN bridges, the site
   may be connected to a SPT Bridge via a virtual port bound to an I-
   Component.  This enables MAC-in-MAC encapsulation to be performed

   before the traffic enters the SPT Region without requiring upgrade
   at the C-VLAN bridging site. In this case the PW at the PE connected
   to the C-VLAN bridging site could be configured as raw mode, non
   service-delimiting.

2.3. Hierarchical L2VPN with SPB and MPLS

   H-VPLS in [RFC4762] describes a two-tier hierarchical solution for
   the purpose of pseudo wire (PW) scalability improvement. This
   improvement is achieved by reducing the number of PE devices
   connected in a full-mesh topology through connecting CE devices via
   the lower-tier access network, which in turn is connected to the
   top-tier core network. However, H-VPLS solutions in [RFC4762]
   require learning and forwarding based on customer MAC addresses,
   which poses scalability issues as the number of VPLS instances and
   customer MAC addresses increase. [PBB-VPLS] describes how to use PBB
   (Provider Backbone Bridges) at the lower-tier access network to
   solve the scalability issue, in which the transit network nodes only
   learn and forward on PBB port MAC addresses instead of customer MAC
   addresses.

   Figure 4 depicts the hierarchical L2VPN architecture with SPT
   Bridge/MPLS technologies. An IP/MPLS network serves the top-tier
   core network function while an SPT Region serves as the low-tier
   access network function. A SPB/PE enabled device is placed at the
   border of the two-tier networks. Ethernet PWs, as described in
   Section 2.1, are configured between pairs of PE components in the
   top-tier IP/MPLS network, which construct a full mesh of links among
   the SPB/PE devices. The SPT Bridge component on a SPB/PE device and
   other SPT Bridges at the same site serve as the low-tier access
   network. Customer CEs connect to SPT Bridges at each site directly.

   This architecture provides E-LAN or E-VLAN connectivity among
   customer CEs connecting to the SPT Region sites. The transit SPT
   Bridge node only forwards and learns other SPT Bridge addresses and
   the number of PWs in the top-tier core network is not related to the
   number of devices connecting to Customer CEs.  This makes the
   solution scale very well. In addition, SPB technology supports
   multiple links from one SPT Bridge to multiple other SPT Bridges and
   prevents loops, which provides the flexibility to construct the
   networks based on traffic demands and dynamically reroute traffic
   when necessary. Figure 4 shows that one SPT Bridge in campus site 1
   connects to two SPB/PE devices and one SPB/PE device connects two
   SPT Bridges at Site 3.

   There are several advantages to using SPT Bridge/MPLS based L2VPNs:
   1) Scalability improvement; 2) Auto-configuration; 3) Good
   efficiency and loop prevention; 4) Multipath support (based on
   802.1Qbp).

   The solution also has advantages over some alternative solutions:

   1. SPT Bridges provide deterministic forwarding behavior, allowing
      network tuning and traffic engineering;

   2. SPB supports shortest path for both unicast and multicast
      traffic;

   3. SPT Bridge core interfaces do not have to be upgraded to support
      a new encapsulation;

   4. I-SID supports over 16M tenants; 5) Mature OAM functionality,
      Ethernet OAM (802.1ag and Y.1731) can be applied to SPB VLANs.

   Note: It is possible to construct a Tiered L2VPN in the combination
   of Figure 4 and 3, i.e. some locations use SPB/PE enabled device and
   some location use separated SPT Bridge and PE devices in a
   Hierarchical L2VPN.

3. Security Considerations

   The IS-IS authentication mechanism [RFC5304] [RFC5310] can be used
   to prevent fabrication of link-state control messages including
   those discussed in this document.

   The use cases do not introduce any new security considerations for
   MPLS networks.

4. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.
