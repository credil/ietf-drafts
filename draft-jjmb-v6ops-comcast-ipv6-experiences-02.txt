1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Beginning in early 2010 Comcast announced plans to leverage the work
   the company has been doing related to IPv6 to conduct a number of
   IPv6 technology trials.  These trials were specifically aimed at
   enabling IPv6 for subscriber services.  The purpose of this document
   is to outline the technologies that have been trialed thus far along
   with experiences and observations that adopters of the same may find
   valuable in their own planning and deployment processes.

   Further, there may be some additional feedback that the various
   groups within the IETF may wish to take into account as part of
   ongoing standards efforts.


3.  6to4

   During production deployment planning the widespread use of 6to4
   [RFC3068] to access content and services over IPv6 was assessed.  In
   some scenarios 6to4 usage increased several hundred times.  At the
   time Comcast had not deployed its own 6to4 relay infrastructure as
   such open relays being operated by independent third parties were by
   default used to facilitate 6to4-based communications.  The deployment
   and default use of open 6to4 relays appears to be a key variable
   behind the sub-optimal performance associated with the use of 6to4.
   An important thing to note is that some home gateway vendors have
   turned on 6to4 by default, and in some of these implementations, they
   have not presented a user interface a user interface to disable it.
   For operators that have not deployed IPv6 or have IPv6 incapable
   infrastructures should note that the use of 6to4 is likely occurring
   today across their infrastructure.  Many operating systems and home
   networking devices continue to support 6to4 and in some cases have
   6to4 and other transition technologies enabled by default.

   As a community there appears to be some consensus that long term the
   use of 6to4 is not desirable, however, in the near term it is clear
   that 6to4 will be used in specific scenarios.  The expectation and
   goal is to see 6to4 usage diminish over time until use of the same is
   displaced by an alternate technique to access content and services
   over IPv6.  While the debate continues over how and when to deprecate
   6to4, it is clear that 6to4 should not be recommended as a primary

   mechanism to access content and services over IPv6.

   The following documents outline the recommendations surrounding the
   use and status of 6to4 from a standards point of view:

   1.  [draft-ietf-v6ops-6to4-advisory]

   2.  [draft-ietf-v6ops-6to4-to-historic]

   Comcast deployed a series of five (5) 6to4 relays in a geographically
   dispersed configuration across our network.  The purpose of these
   relays was to reduce the latency typically associated with 6to4
   usage.  During our analysis, the use of off network, open 6to4 relays
   was determined to yield nearly unusable conditions depending on the
   geographic location of the end user relative to the open 6to4 relay.
   By deploying on-network 6to4 relays, latency in most cases was
   reduced by over 50%, which instantly yielded considerable
   improvements from an end user point of view.  The simplistic design
   and deployment of these relays enabled us to rapidly put them in
   network, and in some cases create a better experience for some of our
   users who had 6to4 enabled.

   Through the use of commodity x86 based servers that run a standard
   Linux Operating System, we reduced deployment and operating costs,
   while still maintaining a fault tolerant design.  Each 6to4 relay was
   dual stacked, and with a simple kernel module, we enabled the 6to4
   configuration.  Some 6to4 specific configurations were required to
   ensure compatibility across a wide range of end points.  The logic to
   anycast the 6to4 records was handled by the network infrastructure
   providing connectivity to the 6to4 relays, and health checking
   enabled us to automatically remove the route for any relay from the
   routing table in case of failure.

4.  6RD

   6RD [draft-townsley-ipv6-6rd] is another transition technology
   similar to 6to4 that Comcast has deployed as part of technology
   trials.  While 6RD yields some improvements over 6to4, 6RD is
   ultimately a tunneling technology.  As such, it is subject to the
   challenges faced by other tunneling technologies.

   As advertised, 6RD frees adopters from some restrictions typically
   associated with 6to4.  The use of anycast addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)
   is no longer required and the infrastructure, like 6to4, is
   straightforward to deploy.  However, at the time of deployment it was
   observed that a limited number of border relay (BR) implementations
   were available.  This appears to be an evolving area with more
   implementations becoming available.  Similarly it was observed that
   there we few if any customer edge (CE) implementations available to
   support a trial of the technology.  As such engineering
   implementations were leveraged to evaluate 6RD.  Further, there were
   no implementations available that supported the 6RD DHCPv4 options
   [draft-ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd].  Because of this, every 6RD CE used
   for trial was manually configured with the necessary information
   required to enable 6RD.  In order to support a wide scale production
   deployment leveraging 6RD an operator would have to ensure their DHCP
   infrastructure supports the required 6RD DHCPv4 options along with
   targeted 6RD CE devices.

   Trial configurations included two (2) 6RD BRs, which were
   intentionally deployed in geographically dispersed configuration.  An
   anycast design was used to enable 6RD with a well known IPv4 anycast
   address and FQDN for the 6RD BR.  The use of anycast eased manual
   configuration and deployment.  Additionally, an IPv6 /32 was used to
   support the 6RD trials permitting subscriber devices were able to
   yield a usable IPv6 /64 on the LAN side of the 6RD CE.

   The quantity and location of the 6RD BRs is a key variable when
   planning the deployment of 6RD.  Comcast specifically deployed a
   limited quantity of BRs resulting in some end users being "closer" to
   the BRs than others.  Proximity to the 6RD BRs is an important factor
   that impacts the end user experience.  While 6RD yields some
   improvements over 6to4, 6RD is ultimately a tunneling technology as

   such use of the same is subject to the challenges faced by other
   tunneling technologies.

   Placement and quantity of 6RD BRs is also a significant variable to
   consider when assessing impacts to performance and IPv6 geo-location.
   A centralized approach to deploying 6RD BRs will yield undesirable
   impacts to IPv6 geo-location in that end users leveraging a
   particular 6RD BR that is geographically distant from their true
   location will not accurately represent the origin of the end user
   request.  Conversely, deploying 6RD BRs that are near to end users
   may require a substantial quantity of 6RD BRs depending on the
   operator network.

   The following provides an overview of the Comcast 6RD trial network
   design:

5.  Native Dual Stack

   Native dual stack is central to Comcast's IPv6 program for trial and
   production deployment.  Native dual stack is the model where IPv4
   services remain as-is with native IPv6 support introduced in parallel
   or simultaneously.  Many of the details surrounding how this is
   achieved are documented as part of the CableLabs Data Over Cable
   Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) 3.0 [DOCSIS3.0].  However,
   relevant trial and deployment specific information that is of
   interest to the IETF community will be documented.

   Native dual stack trials depend on the upgrade and enablement of
   Cable Modem Termination Systems [CMTS] to support IPv6.  A CMTS is a
   device that end users in a cable network connect directly to using
   their cable modem [CM].  As with IPv4, native support for IPv6 is
   critical for the delivery of services to end users in a DOCSIS
   network.  Anything less could yield an undesirable end user
   experience or instability in the operator network that could
   adversely impact larger populations of users.

   Given the CMTS requirements, native dual stack trials have initially
   been limited to specific areas of the network.  Further, where CMTS
   platforms have been upgraded and enabled to support IPv6 end users
   have been incrementally enabled with support for IPv6.  Again this is
   to ensure a controlled introduction with a specific focus on
   maintaining stability.  Initially, a limited combination of cable
   modem and IGD devices are being used to support trial activities.
   Over time diversity for both cable modem and IGDs are expected to
   grow.  To date a number of cable modems support the ability to enable
   native dual stack connectivity to CPEs devices behind them.  A subset
   of pre-DOCSIS 3.0 and all DOCSIS 3.0 devices support this capability.
   The population of DOCSIS devices that support these capabilities
   varies from operator to operator.

   Trial enablement requires the stateful provisioning of an IGD using
   stateful DHCPv6 [RFC3315] for the IGD WAN interface and delegated
   prefixes [RFC3633] for LAN side connectivity.  Similarly, trial
   supported direct attachment of IPv6 capable CPE devices to the CM.
   In this configuration the CPE is provisioned with one or more IPv6
   addresses via stateful DHCPv6 [RFC3315] in similar fashion to the IGD
   WAN interface.  The quantity of devices supporting a native dual
   stack mode of operation is growing.  While some devices are
   upgradable to support native dual stack many devices deployed today
   are not upgradable to support this functionality.  Early
   implementations of devices or devices that are upgradable to support
   native IPv6 were found to only require and/or support the use of an
   IPv6 /64 for LAN side connectivity.  This has been an acceptable mode
   of operation, however, over time IGDs will be required to support

   more advanced functionality including the ability to support
   multiple, routed IPv6 LANs.  While support for a single IPv6 /64 is
   in place today support for shorter IPv6 prefixes is also supported.
   It is important for operators to ensure they design and plan support
   across their infrastructures for delegated prefixes that are shorter
   than /64.

7.  Content and Services

   During early phases of our trials Comcast leveraged reverse proxies
   to expedite the availability of content natively over IPv6.  Open
   source technology running on Linux based servers was used to enable
   the reverse proxies.  To ensure that the origin content, which is
   IPv4 only, is available natively over IPv6 the proxy servers required
   native dual stack connectivity.  This model allowed us to ensure that
   Internet facing access to Comcast content occurred natively over
   IPv6.

   As third party CDNs introduce production quality support for IPv6 we
   plan to move away from the use of proxy servers and fully towards
   native dual stack for Comcast content and services.  Native dual
   stack content is but the first step to ensure the same can be IPv6
   only at some point in the future.  Observations from Comcast's
   participation in World IPv6 day suggest it is premature to rely on
   IPv6-only content at this time

   Further as part of our trials Comcast has also recently enabled IPv6
   Message Transfer Agents (MTA), in a limited fashion, to allow a
   subset of Comcast trial users to send electronic mail using SMTP over
   IPv6..  Due to the limited availability of spam mitigation for IPv6
   Comcast trials does not include the receipt of electronic mail over
   IPv6.  In order to enable the receipt of electronic mail over IPv6
   spam mitigation must be in place.


8.  Backoffice

   We made the decision early on in our design discussions to move all
   systems to a dual-stack design since we felt that this was the best
   way to transition to IPv6.  The re-architect of many core systems
   like DNS, DHCP, OSS/BSS, and Billing systems took many years to plan
   and complete and this approach has paid off and allowed us to rapidly
   move towards support for dual-stack at the edge of our network,
   including support for our customers devices.


9.  World IPv6 Day

   During World IPv6 day, Comcast observed a significant increase in
   native IPv6 traffic once content providers enabled AAAA records for
   their websites.  The resulting traffic has continued to increase even
   after World IPv6 when about 50% of the websites that participated in

   World IPv6 Day left their AAAA records enabled after the day.  We
   view this as a positive sign for continuing to drive more IPv6
   traffic.


10.  Conclusion

   To date Comcast trial activities have yielded important, useful
   information about the various technologies that are available to
   facilitate the transition to IPv6.  Observations and experience to
   date confirms that native dual stack is the preferred approach to
   transition to IPv6, where possible.  While the various tunneling
   technologies are indeed straightforward to deploy there are a number
   of variables that must be considered when planning to deploy the
   same.

   Support for native dual stack continues to evolve across various
   broadband technologies and within consumer electronics.  As evidenced
   by World IPv6 Day many of the world's largest content providers are
   also making progress with their IPv6 capabilities.
