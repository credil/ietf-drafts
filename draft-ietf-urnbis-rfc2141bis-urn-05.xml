      <t>A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) <xref target='RFC3986'/> that is intended to serve as a persistent, location-independent resource identifier.  This document defines the canonical syntax for URIs under the "urn" scheme, guidelines for URN namespaces, requirements for URN presentation and transmission, and methods for determining URN equivalence.</t> 
      <t>URNs were originally defined in <xref target='RFC2141'/>.  The goal of this document is to specify URNs with the smallest reasonable set of changes from the original definition while ensuring consistency with the updated specification of URIs in <xref target='RFC3986'/>.</t>

        ]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>The following sections describe provide additional information about these rules.</t>

      <section title='Namespace Identifier Syntax' anchor='syntax-nid'>
        <t>The syntax here is slightly more restrictive than what was defined in <xref target='RFC2141'/>, since it forbids the character "-" at the end of a NID.</t>
        <t>NIDs are case insensitive (e.g., "ISBN" and "isbn" are equivalent).</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Namespace Specific String Syntax' anchor='syntax-nss'>
        <t>Depending on the rules governing a namespace, names that are valid in a namespace might contain characters that are not allowed in URNs according to the "pchar" rule (e.g., characters outside the ASCII range or characters that are reserved in URIs, such as "/", "?", and "#").  Such a string MUST be translated into a conformant NSS before using it as a protocol element or otherwise passing it on to other applications.  Translation is done by percent-encoding each disallowed character using the method defined in Section 2.1 of <xref target='RFC3986'/>.  Note that the "%" character is allowed only for the purpose of percent-encoding.</t>
        <t>If a namespace designates one or more characters conforming to the "pchar" rule as having special meaning for that namespace (e.g., "@") and the namespace also uses that character in a literal sense, when used in a literal sense the character MUST be percent-encoded (e.g., "%40").  For related considerations with regard to NID registration, see <xref target='I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc3406bis-urn-ns-reg'/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Query Component and Fragment Identifier Component' anchor='syntax-queryfragment'>
        <t>The URI specification <xref target='RFC3986'/> allows a query component, a fragment identifier component, or both after the path component of a URI, where the character '?' is used as a separator to denote the beginning of the query component and the character '#' is used as a separator to denote the beginning of the fragment identifier component.  The original URN syntax specification <xref target='RFC2141'/> reserved the '?' and '#' characters for future developments.  This specification aligns URN syntax with URI syntax by allowing the query component and fragment identifier component after (not within) the Namespace Specific String (NSS).</t>
        <t>This specification does not define the applicability and semantics of the query component or the fragment identifier component in URNs.  Additional specifications might establish these matters for URN-related services (such as resolution) or for individual URN namespaces.  For example, it is possible that the query component might be used in requests to URN resolution services, or that the fragment identifier component might be used to distinguish the integral parts of resources named by URNs.  However, defining such usage is left to specifications for URN resolution services, namespace registration requests and specifications for individual namespaces (which might use some namespace-specific syntax instead of the URI fragment identifier component), and other appropriate documentation (such as policy documents governing the management of a given URN namespace).</t>
        <t>Although URN assignment is often a managed process (see <xref target='I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc3406bis-urn-ns-reg'/>), the query component or fragment identifier component can be appended after the NSS once a URN has been assigned in accordance with the rules for a given namespace.</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title='URN Presentation and Transport' anchor='transport'>
      <t>The URN syntax defines the canonical format for URNs.  All URN transport and interchanges MUST take place in this format.  Further, all URN-aware applications MUST offer the option of displaying URNs in this canonical form to allow for direct transcription (for example by cut and paste techniques).  Such applications might support display of URNs in a more human-friendly form and might use a character set that includes characters that are not permitted in URN syntax as defined in this RFC (i.e., when displaying URNs to humans, such applications might replace percent-encoded strings with characters in an extended character set such as Unicode).</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Lexical Equivalence in URNs' anchor='equivalence'>
      <section title='Procedure' anchor='equivalence-procedure'>
        <t>For various purposes such as caching, often it is desirable to determine if two URNs are "the same".  This is done by testing for "lexical equivalence".</t>
        <t>Two URNs are lexically equivalent if they are octet-by-octet equal after applying case normalization (as specified in Section 6.2.2.1 of <xref target='RFC3986'/>) to the following constructs:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>the URI scheme "urn"</t>
            <t>the NID</t>
            <t>any percent-encoded characters (see Section 2.1 of <xref target='RFC3986'/>)</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Percent-encoded characters MUST NOT be decoded, i.e., percent-encoding normalization (as specified in Section 6.2.2.2 of <xref target='RFC3986'/>) MUST NOT be applied.</t>
        <t>If a query component, fragment identifier component, or both have been appended to the assigned URI, they MUST be ignored for purposes of determining lexical equivalence.</t>
        <t>URN namespaces MAY define additional rules for lexical equivalence, such as case-insensitivity of the NSS (or parts thereof).  Such rules MUST always have the effect of eliminating some of the false negatives obtained by the procedure above and MUST NOT result in treating two URNs as not equivalent if the procedure here says they are equivalent.  For related considerations with regard to NID registration, see <xref target='I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc3406bis-urn-ns-reg'/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section title='Examples' anchor='equivalence-examples'>
        <t>The following URN comparisons (which use the "example" NID defined in <xref target='RFC6963'/>) highlight the lexical equivalence rules:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>URN:example:a123,456</t>
            <t>urn:example:a123,456</t>
            <t>urn:EXAMPLE:a123,456</t>
            <t>urn:example:A123,456</t>
            <t>urn:example:a123%2C456</t>
            <t>URN:EXAMPLE:a123%2c456</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>URNs 1, 2, and 3 are lexically equivalent.  URN 4 is not lexically equivalent to any of the other URNs in the above set.  URNs 5 and 6 are lexically equivalent only to each other.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title='Functional Equivalence in URNs' anchor='functional'>
      <t>Functional equivalence is determined within a given namespace and managed by resolvers for that namespace, and thus is beyond the scope of this document.  For related considerations with regard to NID registration, see <xref target='I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc3406bis-urn-ns-reg'/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Handling of URNs by URI Processors' anchor='uri'>
      <t>The URN syntax has been defined so that URNs can be used in places where URIs are expected.  A resolver that conforms to the URI specification <xref target='RFC3986'/> will extract a scheme of "urn" rather than a scheme value of "urn:&lt;nid&gt;".</t>  
      <t>A URN MUST be considered an opaque URI by URI resolvers and passed (with the "urn" scheme) to a URN resolver for resolution.  The URN resolver can either be an external resolver that the URI resolver knows of, or it can be functionality built-in to the URI resolver.</t>
      <t>To minimize user confusion, a URI browser SHOULD display the complete URN (including the "urn" scheme) to ensure that there is no confusion between URN namespace identifiers and URL scheme identifiers.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
      <t>This document specifies the syntax for URNs.  While some namespaces resolvers might assign special meaning to certain of the characters of the Namespace Specific String, any security considerations resulting from such assignment are outside the scope of this document.  For related considerations with regard to NID registration, see <xref target='I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc3406bis-urn-ns-reg'/>.</t>

<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.

<abstract>
<t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>
