Abstract

   Unicast and multi-destination data frame may follow the different
   path in TRILL network. We need the ping and traceroute like
   applications for the connectivity testing and fault isolation on the
   multi-destination path in addition to the unicast path. This document
   specifies the format and handling of the new TRILL OAM protocol
   messages and TLVs which can be used for the multi-destination OAM.

Internet-Draft    OAM along Multi-destination Path        October 2011


1. Introduction

   When RBridges are deployed in a real network, a number of
   applications are necessary for error detection/reporting and
   diagnostic purpose. TRILL RBridge channel [RBridgeChannel] was
   designed for carrying the OAM relevant messages. [RBridgeOAM] has
   defined the ping and traceroute applications for unicast path and
   also the error reporting mechanisms.

   Multi-destination data path in TRILL network has different
   characteristics from the unicast path. One or more distribution trees
   are formed for multi-destination traffic. RBridges advertise their
   interests in receiving the traffic of the specific VLANs. The
   distribution tree may or may not be pruned based on VLAN ID.
   Troubleshooting on the multi-destination path is a desirable feature
   of TRILL OAM. This document specifies the messages and mechanisms
   used by multi-destination OAM.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The same terminology and acronyms are used in this document as in
   [RF6325].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

3. Motivations

   In an RBridge campus, unicast and multi-destination traffic may
   follow different paths between the same ingress and egress RBridges.
   [RBridgeOAM] specifies some OAM along unicast path. For diagnostic
   purposes it is also desirable to check the connectivity between two
   or more RBridges along a particular distribution tree.

   There are various things we want to test for multi-destination path.

   - Along a distribution tree, who are the leaf nodes of an inner VLAN?
   The leaf nodes here refer to the RBridges announcing the given inner
   VLAN as their interested VLAN in INT-VLAN sub-TLV. It is useful when
   we want to check if the configuration/provisioning are consistent
   with the design.

   - Along a distribution tree, check the connectivity from the ingress
   RBridge to one or more leaf nodes of an inner vlan. It can be used as
   the first step in diagnosis when we suspect multi-destination data
   path to certain RBridge fails. Transit nodes do not decapsulate the

   multi-destination data frame; therefore we do not think it is much of
   interest to check the connectivity to any non-leaf RBridges.

   - Along a distribution tree, trace the multi-destination data path
   hop-by-hop to a target RBridge. It is useful when we want to find out
   where exactly is the failed hop.

   This document specifies new messages and TLVs used by multi-
   destination OAM applications like multi-destination ping and
   traceroute. Processing of these messages is also discussed in the
   draft.

4. RBridge Channel Message Format

   The RBridge Channel Header fields is as follows,

   o CHV (Channel Header Version):  zero.
   o Channel Protocol: 0x006 (Echo in the Long Format) (TBD)
   o Flags: The SL and NA bits SHOULD be zero, the MH bit SHOULD be one
   o ERR: zero.

5. OAM Protocol Frame Format for Echo in the Long Format

   The frame format is shown as follows. In the rest of this document,
   echo request and echo reply are brief ways to refer to the Echo
   Request in Long Format and Echo Reply in Long Format messages.

   collection on delay and/or jitter using one-way echo operation.

   request in most cases.
      o  Flags: A bit vector with the following format. Currently only
   the H (Respond Only When Hop Count is Zero) flag is defined. In
   practice, we set H flag to be 0 for ping type applications and 1 for
   traceroute type applications of multi-destination OAM. With H flag
   set, it will help to prevent the duplicate echo replies from the same
   RBridge triggered by echo request with different hop count value in
   the same traceroute operation. H flag is only significant in echo
   request and MUST NOT be set in echo reply. The detailed processing
   based on the value of H flag is explained in section 7.2.

      o  Number of Target RBridges: The number of nicknames specified in
   the following fields, the maximum number is 127.

      o  Target RBridge Nickname: The nickname of a Target RBridge.

   This TLV MAY appear in an echo request. It SHOULD be copied back in
   the corresponding echo reply messages.

   Target RBridge TLV is used by multi-destination OAM. For ping along
   the multi-destination path, the Target RBridge TLV with multiple
   nicknames MAY be included in echo request. It implies RBridges with
   any of the nicknames in the TLV should reply. While for traceroute
   like application, only a single nickname can be included in this TLV.
   If there was more than one nickname in the TLV, only the first
   nickname MUST be used as target nickname for tracing purpose.

   When Target RBridge TLV is not included in an echo request, it
   implies the unspecified target. If an echo request with unspecified
   target was sent by ping like applications, then all leaf nodes in
   distribution tree pruned by the given inner VLAN SHOULD send back
   echo reply. If echo request with unspecified target was sent by
   traceroute like application, RBridges receiving the incoming frame
   with hop count value 1 would process the echo request and send back
   'Hop Count is Zero' error notification.

      o  Jitter time: Set to the upper bound of the jitter period in
   milliseconds. A responding node SHOULD wait a random amount of time
   between zero milliseconds and the value specified.

   This TLV MAY appear in an Echo Request in the Long format. It SHOULD
   NOT be present in echo reply messages.

7. Processing Echo Messages for Multi-destination Path

7.1. Sending an echo request

   The inner frame header and TRILL header fields are as follows:

   o Inner.MacSA: MAC address of RBridge originating the echo request
   o Inner.MacDA: Defaults to All-Egress-RBridges. It can be set to L2
multicast address derived from IP multicast group.
   o Inner.VLAN ID: Defaults to 1. It can be any enabled VLAN ID on the
ingress RBridge.
   o Ingress RBridge Nickname: the nickname of RBridge originating the
   echo request
   o Egress RBridge Nickname: the nickname of a distribution tree root
   o M bit: 1
   o Hop Count: defaults to maximum value 0x3F.

     - For ping like applications, it can be any value which is believed
     to be no less than the number of hops from ingress RBridge to the
     most distant target RBridge in the tree.

     - For traceroute like applications, hop count value starts from 1
     and is increased by one for each sending of echo request.

   H(Respond Only When Hop Count is Zero) flag in echo request is set to
   1 for traceroute like applications and 0 for ping like applications.

   The originating RBridge chooses the values of Sender's Instance and
   Sequence Number for the echo request. Sequence number should be
   increased by 1 for each new subsequent echo request of the same
   Sender's Instance. The Timestamp Sent is set to the time-of-day in
   NTP format [NTP] according to the sender's clock. The Timestamp
   Received is set to zero.

   The originating RBridge MAY use Target RBridge TLV to specify the
   target. For ping like applications, multiple nicknames MAY be present
   in one such TLV if sender wants to ping multiple targets at one time.
   For traceroute like applications, the TLV should at most contain one
   nickname as the tracing target. If there is more than one nickname,
   only the first one takes effect.

Internet-Draft    OAM along Multi-destination Path        October 2011


   Echo request without Target RBridge TLV means the originating RBridge
   potentially wants to target every RBridge in the distribution tree.
   We also call it echo request with the unspecified target. For ping
   like applications, echo request with the unspecified target implies
   the sender wants to know who are the leaf nodes of the inner VLAN in
   the distribution tree. For traceroute like applications, it implies
   the sender wants to know the whole distribution tree structure hop-
   by-hop.

   The Originating RBridge MAY include the Jitter TLV (see section 6.2)
   in the echo request in order to randomize the delay of the replying
   echo message from multiple RBridges.



7.2. Receiving an echo request

   RBridge receiving an echo request with M bit set with EtherType of
   RBridge channel [RBridgeChannel] SHOULD replicate it to the control
   plane for processing and also forward it as normal multi-destination
   data frame. When a RBridge receives an incoming frame with hop count
   is 1 in TRILL header, it will not forward the frame further. If reply
   mode is 1, no echo reply is generated. For the sub sections below, we
   assume the reply mode is set to 2.

7.2.1. If H (Respond Only When Hop Count is Zero) Flag Is Not Set

   - If Target RBridge TLV is not present in the echo request:

      All leaf nodes of the distribution tree in the inner VLAN MUST
      process the incoming echo request and send back echo reply.

   - If Target RBridge TLV is present in the echo request:

      An RBridge owning any one of the specified target nicknames in the
      incoming echo request MUST send back echo reply when it is a leaf
      node of the distribution tree in the inner VLAN.

   If echo reply has already been generated for the incoming echo
   request, RBridge will not generate 'Hop Count is Zero' error
   notification even when the hop count value in the incoming echo
   request is one.

   Echo request with 'H' flag unset is for ping like application. It
   should be noted that if an RBridge receives an echo request with its
   own nickname listed as one of the targets, it does not send back the
   echo reply if the RBridge did not advertise its interest of inner

Internet-Draft    OAM along Multi-destination Path        October 2011


   VLAN. That is to say, the connectivity check using ping in multi-
   destination path is constrained by inner VLAN. Normally VLAN 1 is the
   default VLAN and enabled on every RBridge. Therefore it is
   recommended to put inner VLAN to be 1 when we want to check the
   connectivity without the constraint of a particular customer VLAN. We
   may use the echo replies from that to plot the whole distribution
   tree.

7.2.2. If H (Respond Only When Hop Count is Zero) Flag Is Set

   When hop count of the incoming echo request is not one, RBridge would
   never generate any echo reply or 'hop count iz zero' error
   notification.

   If the hop count is one in the incoming echo request:

   - If Target RBridge TLV is not present in the echo request:

      RBridge receiving the incoming frame with hop count equal to 1
      MUST send back error notification of 'Hop Count is Zero'. RBridges
      MUST not generate any echo reply in this case. If hop count in
      incoming echo request is more than 1, control plane will not do
      anything. RBridge forwards the frame as normal multi-destination
      TRILL frame in data plane.

   - If Target RBridge TLV is present in the echo request:

      RBridges owning the only target nickname listed in TLV MUST send
      back echo reply if it is a leaf node of the inner VLAN in the
      distribution tree. If it is not a leaf node of the inner vlan, no
      echo reply will be generated by the owner RBridge; however, 'Hop
      Count is Zero' error notification will be sent back instead.

      If an RBridge not owning the only target nickname listed in TLV
      receives the incoming frame with hop count equal to 1, it SHOULD
      check its LSDB. If it sits in-between of the ingress RBridge and
      the target RBridge along the specified distribution tree, RBridge
      MUST send back the error notification of 'Hop Count is Zero';
      otherwise the RBridge should not generate such error notification.
      The purpose of suppressing the error notification here is to make
      sure the ingress only receives the error notification along the
      real data path and to reduce the processing burden at ingress.

      If RBridge not owning the first target nickname listed in TLV
      receives the incoming frame with hop count greater than 1, the
      frame is forwarded as usual.

   Echo request with 'H' flag set is for traceroute like applications.
   For traceroute with unspecified target, the ingress RBridge will be
   able to construct the whole distribution tree (when tree is not
   pruned) or the distribution tree of inner vlan (when tree is pruned
   by inner VLAN) according to the returned error notifications. For
   traceroute with a specified target in an inner VLAN, the ingress
   RBridge will receive the error notifications from the RBridges along
   the path to the target in the tree. If the target announced its
   interest of the inner VLAN, it will finally send back echo reply to
   the ingress. If the target did not announce its interest of the inner
   VLAN, either the target will not receive the echo request (e.g. it is
   located in the tree path being pruned) or the target will send back
   error notification of 'Hop Count is Zero' instead of echo reply.



7.3. Sending an echo reply

   The inner frame header and TRILL header fields are as follows,

   o Inner.MacSA: The MAC address of the RBridge generating the echo
   reply
   o Inner.MacDA: All-Egress-RBridges
   o Inner.VLAN ID: same as Inner.VLAN ID in the received echo request
   to which the echo reply responds
   o Ingress RB Nickname: the nickname of the RBridge generating the
   echo reply.
   o Egress RBridge Nickname: the ingress RBridge nickname in the
   corresponding received echo request
   o M bit: 0
   o Hop Count: defaults to the maximum value 0x3F. It can be any value
   that is believed to be larger than the number of hops from ingress to
   egress RBridge.



   The values of Sender's Instance, Sequence Number and Timestamp sent
   in an echo reply MUST be same as those in its corresponding echo
   request. H flag MUST be zero in echo reply. The value of Timestamp
   Received is set to the time-of-day in NTP format [NTP] according to
   the receiver's clock.

   If Target RBridge TLV was present in the echo request, the
   corresponding echo reply SHOULD copy it.

   Next Hop Nickname and Incoming Port ID TLV [RBridgeOAM] MAY be
   included in echo reply.

   When an echo reply is going to be sent to the originator RBridge,
   'Hop Count is Zero' error notification MUST not be sent in response
   to the same echo request.

7.4. Receiving an echo reply

   An RBridge SHOULD use the Sender's Instance and Sequence Number to
   match up the received echo reply with the echo request it sent. If
   there is no match found, the RBridge should discard the echo reply.

   If Jitter TLV was present in the echo request, the round trip time
   should not be calculated based on the difference between the arriving
   time of echo reply and the value of "TimeStamp sent" in the replying
   frame. However the single trip time is always correct to be
   calculated on Timestamp Received minus Timestamp Sent when the clocks
   of sender and receiver are synchronized.

   When an RBridge receives either an echo reply or 'hop count is zero'
   error notification from the target RBridge for traceroute like
   application, it SHOULD stop sending echo request with increased hop
   count value.

8. Security Considerations

   The security vulnerabilities raised in [RBridgeOAM] also apply to
   the multi-destination RBridge ping in this document. The same
   mechanisms can be used to prevent or alleviate the security issues.

9. IANA Considerations

   New error notification sub-code needs to be allocated by IANA as
   specified in Section 7.
