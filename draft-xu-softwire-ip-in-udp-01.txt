Abstract 

   Existing Softwire encapsulation technologies are not adequate for 
   efficient load balancing of Softwire service traffic across IP 
   networks. This document specifies additional Softwire encapsulation 
   technology, referred to as IP-in-User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which 
   can facilitate the load balancing of Softwire service traffic across 
   IP networks.

Internet-Draft          Encapsulating IP in UDP           February 2013 
 
    
1. Introduction 

   To fully utilize the bandwidth available in IP networks and/or 
   facilitate recovery from a link or node failure, load balancing of 
   traffic over Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and/or Link Aggregation 
   Group (LAG) across IP networks is widely used. In practice, most 
   existing core routers in IP networks support distributing IP traffic 
   flows over ECMP paths and/or LAG based on the hash of the five-tuple 
   of User Datagram Protocol (UDP)[RFC768] and Transmission Control 
   Protocol (TCP) packets (i.e., source IP address, destination IP 
   address, source port, destination port, and protocol). 

   [RFC5640] describes a method for improving the load balancing 
   efficiency in a network carrying Softwire Mesh service [RFC5565] 
   over Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3) [RFC3931] and 
   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)[RFC2784] encapsulations. However, 
   this method requires core routers to perform hash calculation on the 
   "load-balancing" field contained in tunnel encapsulation headers 
   (i.e., the Session ID field in L2TPv3 headers or the Key field in 
   GRE headers), which is not widely supported by existing core routers.  

   Since most existing core routers already support balancing IP 
   traffic flows based on the hash of the five-tuple of UDP packets, by 
   encapsulating Softwire service traffic into UDP tunnels, it will 
   enable existing core routers to perform efficient load-balancing of 
   the Softwire service traffic without requiring any change to them. 
   Therefore, this specification defines an IP-in-UDP encapsulation 
   method for Softwire service. 

2. Terminology 

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC5565].

            Source Port of UDP 

                This field contains an entropy value that is generated 
                by the ingress PE router. For example, the entropy value 
                can be generated by performing hash calculation on 
                certain fields in the customer packets (e.g., the five 
                tuple of UDP/TCP packets).       

            Destination Port of UDP 

                This field is set to a value (TBD) indicating the 
                encapsulated payload in the UDP header is an IP packet. 
                As for whether the encapsulated IP packet is IPv4 or 
                IPv6, it would be determined according to the Version 
                field in the IP header of the encapsulated IP packet. 

            UDP Length 

                The usage of this field is in accordance with the 
                current UDP specification [RFC768]. 

            UDP Checksum        

                The usage of this field is in accordance with the 
                current UDP specification. To simplify the operation on 
                egress PE routers, this field is recommended to be set 
                to zero.     

4. Processing Procedures  

   This IP-in-UDP encapsulation causes E-IP [RFC5565] packets to be 
   forwarded across an I-IP transit core via "UDP tunnels". When 
   performing IP-in-UDP encapsulation by an ingress AFBR, the entropy 
   value would be generated by the ingress PE router and then be filled 
   in the Source Port field of the UDP header.

Internet-Draft          Encapsulating IP in UDP           February 2013 
 
   Transit routers, upon receiving these UDP encapsulated packets, 
   could balance these packets based on the hash of the five-tuple of 
   UDP packets. 

   Egress AFBRs receiving these UDP encapsulated packets MUST 
   decapsulate these packets by removing the UDP header and then 
   forward them accordingly. 

   5. Encapsulation Considerations 

   Similar to all other Softwire tunneling technologies, IP-in-UDP 
   encapsualtion introduces overheads and reduces the effective Maximum 
   Transmision Unit (MTU) size. IP-in-UDP encapsulation may also impact 
   Time-to-Live (TTL) and Differentiated Services (DSCP). Hence, IP-in-
   UDP MUST follow the corresponding procedures defined in [RFC2003].  

   If an ingress AFBR performs fragmentation on an E-IP packet before 
   encapsulating, it MUST use the same source UDP port for all 
   fragmented packets so as to ensures these fragmented packets are 
   always forwarded on the same path. 

5. Security Considerations 

   The security consideration for IP-in-UDP encapsulation format is the 
   same as that for the existing Softwire encapsulation methods for 
   Softwire service such as IP-in-IP. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   A new UDP destination port number which indicates the encapsulated 
   payload following the UDP header is an IP packet needs to be 
   assigned by IANA.
