             A Taxonomy on Private Use Fields in Protocols
                    draft-lonvick-private-tax-05.txt

Abstract

   This document attempts to provide some clarification for the way that
   private use fields have been used in protocols developed in the IETF.
   It is strictly a taxonomy of what has been published and offers a
   minimal amount of advice about how to design or use private use
   options.

Internet-Draft             Private Use Fields                  July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Simply put, communications protocols are standardized ways for
   computing entities to convey information.  Within each communications
   protocol, there must be standardized pieces of information that will
   be communicated, and there may be non-standardized pieces that can be
   communicated.  Since one of the goals of standards is to provide
   interoperability, all parties participating in any communications
   protocol must be aware of how to deal with all fields in the
   protocol.  Fields reserved for private use cannot provide
   interoperability unless their use is fully documented in openly
   available documents.  This section uses examples of some well known
   protocols to demonstrate the differences between protocols that use
   private use options, and those that don't.

   The Time Protocol [RFC0868] is an example of a protocol that only
   conveys standardized information.  There is no way to add anything
   other than what is specified in the document.  On the other hand, DOD
   STANDARD TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL [RFC0761] does have "options"
   but they must be registered through the IANA [IANAtcp], which does
   not leave any room for optional information supplied by equipment
   vendors, network operators, or experimenters.  Finally, Vendor-
   Identifying Vendor Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   version 4 (DHCPv4) [RFC3925] does allow for vendor specific options
   that do not need to be registered with anyone.

   If a network operator wanted to add specific information to the Time
   Protocol [RFC0868], they could modify the code of the senders and
   receivers and run this within their own domain without any problems.
   However, if an equipment vendor wanted to include information
   specific to their equipment, they would have to ensure that all
   senders and receivers within all network domains would either accept
   the change in the protocol, or would not have problems with it.  As a
   final case, if several equipment vendors desired to add equipment-
   specific information to this protocol, they would have to take great
   care that only their own receivers would accept information from
   their own transmitters.  An extension to that would be that if one
   equipment vendor would like to transmit or receive the same
   information that another vendor is using.

   For the case of TCP [RFC0761], standard options are expected; senders
   may use them and receivers may be configured to act upon that
   information, or to ignore it.  If an experimenter wants to add an
   option, they will have to create a new IETF RFC with specific
   details, or obtain approval from the IESG to have the IANA add to the
   registry [IANAtcp].  Similarly, if equipment vendors Foo and Bar were
   to have a need for a similar option within TCP, they would each have
   to go through the process to add to the registry.  On the other hand,

Internet-Draft             Private Use Fields                  July 2012


   if a properly crafted multipurpose private use option were to be
   registered, such as in the case of multiple vendor instances within
   DHCPv4 [RFC3925], then vendors and experimenters would each be able
   to use it for their own purposes as long as all network participants
   could easily differentiate between the entities using the option.

   This document explores the various ways that protocols have allowed
   optional information to be included using fields designated as
   "private use".  It uses examples in some well known protocols.  In
   well developed protocols, private use options may be useful in
   avoiding allocation conflicts, and in dynamically extending a
   feature.  As with all good things, this will come with a cost.
   Adding any extra fields to a protocol will require additional
   processing for both the sender and the receiver.  Also, larger
   packets will take up more bandwidth in transmission.  In another
   aspect, a receiver will have to reserve buffers for an expected field
   in an inbound packet.  Since one way of implementing private use
   options is to only enable the field if it is needed, then the
   allocation of buffers could be considered wasteful if it is actually
   not used.


2.  Origins of the Private Use Name Space

   Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs
   [RFC2434] describes that values of specific name spaces may either be
   registered with the IANA, or not.  In most cases, there are well
   defined values for name spaces.  However, as the document explains,
   not all name spaces require centralized administration.

   In that document, it seems to be assumed that private use name spaces
   will be domain specific and it will be up to the administrators of
   any domain to avoid conflicts.  The first example given about private
   use name spaces refers to Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   [RFC2131] and presumably DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions
   [RFC2132].  In this the example states that "site-specific options in
   DHCP have significance only within a single site".  As noted below
   this became a problem that was rectified in a later revision of DHCP.

   Later works identified a need to place a scope on private use name
   spaces.  The second example of private use name spaces in the IANA
   guidelines [RFC2434] is from STANDARD FOR THE FORMAT OF ARPA INTERNET
   TEXT MESSAGES [RFC0822] which describes X- headers.  Again, there is
   no effort made to control the name space.  It appears however that
   the users of X- headers have self-organized; most consistently use
   features that are universally useful and many have incorporated
   identifiers for useful features that may overlap.

3.  Nomenclature

   In this document, the following words are defined to prevent
   ambiguity.  Some of these words have not been used in the referenced
   works but their meanings can be ascertained and applied.

   o  Communications protocol - a formal description of digital message
      formats and the rules for exchanging those messages in or between
      computing systems and in telecommunications [wpProt]

         Example: The File Transfer Protocol [RFC0959] is an example of
         a communications protocol.  It has well defined fields and
         standard options.  The Syslog Protocol [RFC5424] is another
         example of a communications protocol.  It has well defined
         fields, standard options, and it also has standard and private
         use options.  (See Section 4.2.4.)

   o  Protocol frame - a defined container of fields used to convey
      information in a communications protocol

         Example: An Internet Protocol packet [RFC0791] is considered to
         be a protocol frame.  In the case of The File Transfer Protocol
         [RFC0959], an FTP message from the client to the server within
         the Internet Protocol [RFC0791] containing an FTP command is a
         protocol frame.  In the case of The Syslog Protocol [RFC5424],
         a message from the client to the server within the Internet
         Protocol [RFC0791] containing a syslog message is also a
         protocol frame.

   o  Field - any defined container within a communications protocol
      frame

         Example: In the case of The File Transfer Protocol [RFC0959], a
         command will be contained within a field.  In the case of The
         Syslog Protocol [RFC5424], the HOSTNAME is a field.

   o  Standard option - a field in a protocol frame that may only use
      values that are strictly defined within a specification

         Example: In the case of The File Transfer Protocol [RFC0959],
         an FTP command, such as CDUP or QUIT, is a standard option.
         The reason that a command is a standard option is that only the
         values listed by the IANA in the registry [IANAftp] may be
         used.  The standard options are not limited to the values
         defined in the original RFC, but also include any additions to
         the registry.  In the case of The Syslog Protocol [RFC5424], an
         SD-ID may be a standard option.  The example given in Section
         7.1.4 of [RFC5424] of

        [timeQuality tzKnown="0" isSynced="0"]

         is a standard option because all of the fields are listed in
         the document and in the IANA registry [IANAslg].

   o  Private use option - a field in a protocol frame that is reserved
      for private or local use only name spaces

         Example: In the case of The Syslog Protocol, an SD-ID may be a
         private use option.  Example 3 given in Section 6.5 contains a
         private use option.

         <165>1 2003-10-11T22:14:15.003Z mymachine.example.com
         evntslog - ID47 [exampleSDID@32473 iut="3" eventSource=
         "Application" eventID="1011"] BOMAn application
         event log entry...

         Specifically, the SD-ID starting with "[exampleSDID@32473 ..."
         is not a specifically defined option in the RFC, nor is it
         registered in the IANA registry [IANAslg].  It is a way for an
         equipment vendor to insert their specific information without
         having to register anything.  In this case if the receiver
         knows the format of that SD-ID then it can immediately
         interpret its meaning.  However, if it does not know how to
         interpret that SD-ID, it can still log the message and an
         Operator or Administrator can look up its meaning at a later
         time.

   o  Name space - the set of possible values a field may contain; its
      actual content may be a name, a number or another kind of value

         Example: In the same Example 3 from Section 6.5 of The Syslog
         Protocol [RFC5424], "exampleSDID@32473" provides the name space
         so the context of the rest of the SD-ID may be interpreted.
         Specifically the Private Enterprise Number [IANApen] (PEN) is
         used to associate the option with a private enterprise, and the
         text before the "@" identifies the option defined within that
         private enterprise.


4.  Examples of Successful Private Use Options

   This section contains a review of RFCs that allow the use of private
   use options.  There seem to be three ways to address the name space:
   via a global origin, via a truncated numerical origin, and via a name
   space based upon a domain name.

Internet-Draft             Private Use Fields                  July 2012


4.1.  SNMP

   Likely, the first private use option was defined in the Structure and
   Identification of Management Information for  TCP/IP-based Internets
   [RFC1155] which was first used in A Simple Network Management
   Protocol [RFC1067] (SNMP).  The structure of management information
   (SMI) has been updated and is currently defined as the Structure of
   Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2) [RFC2578].

   SMI is a well described tree of OBJECT IDENTIFIERs (OIDs).  OIDs have
   an origin and a path for defined object identifiers which this
   document describes as standard options.  It also allows for
   experimental and vendor specific object identifiers, which are
   described as private use options in this document.  The IANA
   maintains a registry of these Network Management Parameters
   [IANAsmi].

   The Internet subtree of experimental OBJECT IDENTIFIERs starts with
   the prefix: 1.3.6.1.3., and the Internet subtree of private
   enterprise OBJECT IDENTIFIERs starts with the prefix: 1.3.6.1.4.1.
   This is followed by a Private Enterprise Number [IANApen] (PEN) and
   then the objects defined by that enterprise.

   Specific codes, known as error-indexes, are used to indicate when a
   request cannot be processed because a device does not understand a
   request.

   While this is very practical and practicable for SNMP, fully
   qualified OIDs are not always well suited to be used as an indicator
   for private use options.

4.2.  Private Enterprise Number

   Rather than using the entire SMI, protocol engineers started using
   just the Private Enterprise Number [IANApen].  This reduces the
   length of the identifier but continues to provide an identifier
   through a globally unique name space.  This section provides examples
   of how the PEN has been used to provide private use options.

4.2.1.  RADIUS

   The Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) [RFC2058]
   specification documented how to use just the PEN (without the rest of
   the SMI path to the root) to allow "vendors" to articulate their own
   options.  In that document, these are called Vendor-Specific
   Attributes (VSA).

   The updated RADIUS document, [RFC2865], gives guidance for using the

Internet-Draft             Private Use Fields                  July 2012


   VSA.

   o  Servers not equipped to interpret the vendor-specific information
      sent by a client MUST ignore it (although it may be reported).

   o  Clients which do not receive desired vendor-specific information
      SHOULD make an attempt to operate without it, although they may do
      so (and report they are doing so) in a degraded mode.

   o  The Attribute-Specific field is dependent on the vendor's
      definition of that attribute.

   o  It SHOULD be encoded as a sequence of vendor type / vendor length
      / value fields.

   o  Multiple subattributes MAY be encoded within a single Vendor-
      Specific Attribute, although they do not have to be.

   There are many attributes defined in RADIUS [RFC2058] which may be
   considered to be standard options.  Each of these attributes is
   specified within a "type length value" (tlv) container.  For this
   protocol, the attribute "type" is a specific numerical value which
   differentiates it from other attributes.  As an example, the User-
   Name (type 1) and User-Password (type 2) may be considered to be
   standard options as they are well defined within the specification.

   Type 26 denotes the Vendor Specified Attribute.  It is "available to
   allow vendors to support their own extended Attributes not suitable
   for general usage".  The PEN starts the "value" which should then
   include a subsequent nested tlv so the vendor may define and
   enumerate their own options within that field.

4.2.2.  Mobile IP

   Mobile IP Vendor Specific Extensions [RFC3115] defines two extensions
   that can be used for making organization specific extensions by
   vendors/organizations for their own specific purposes for Mobile IP
   [RFC2002].  Mobile IP has been revised several times and is currently
   specified in IP Mobility Support for IPv4, Revised [RFC5944].

   In that specification, two tlv's have been defined to contain private
   use options.  These are called Vendor/Organization Specific
   Extensions (VSE).

   o  When the Critical Vendor/Organization Specific Extension (CVSE) is
      encountered but not recognized, the message containing the
      extension MUST be silently discarded.

Internet-Draft             Private Use Fields                  July 2012


   o  When a Normal Vendor/Organization Specific Extension (NVSE) is
      encountered but not recognized, the extension SHOULD be ignored,
      but the rest of the Extensions and message data MUST still be
      processed.

   Having two VSEs of this nature for private use options is consistent
   with the original Mobile IP specification [RFC2002] which states:

      When an Extension numbered in either of these sets within the
      range 0 through 127 is encountered but not recognized, the message
      containing that Extension MUST be silently discarded.  When an
      Extension numbered in the range 128 through 255 is encountered
      which is not recognized, that particular Extension is ignored, but
      the rest of the Extensions and message data MUST still be
      processed.

4.2.3.  DHCP

   The introduction to Vendor-Identifying Vendor Options for Dynamic
   Host Configuration Protocol version 4 (DHCPv4) [RFC3925] states:

      The DHCP protocol for IPv4, [RFC2131], defines options that allow
      a client to indicate its vendor type (option 60), and the DHCP
      client and server to exchange vendor-specific information (option
      43) [RFC2132].  Although there is no prohibition against passing
      multiple copies of these options in a single packet, doing so
      would introduce ambiguity of interpretation, particularly if
      conveying vendor-specific information for multiple vendors.

   This meant that Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [RFC2131]
   specified that there was one instance of the vendor type, and the
   receiver used that name space to set the scope for the fields in the
   vendor-specific information option.

   This situation was resolved with the publication of Vendor-
   Identifying Vendor Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   version 4 (DHCPv4) [RFC3925] which states:

      The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) options for Vendor
      Class and Vendor-Specific Information can be limiting or ambiguous
      when a DHCP client represents multiple vendors.

   That specification ([RFC3925]) then used the PEN [IANApen] to define
   a unique name space for private use options in this protocol.
   Similar to other protocols of this era, tlv containers were used.

   When this protocol was updated to conform to the requirements of
   IPv6, the PEN was again used as the way to identify the origin of the

Internet-Draft             Private Use Fields                  July 2012


   private use option.

4.2.4.  Syslog

   The Syslog Protocol [RFC5424] also uses the PEN to uniquely qualify
   the name space for a private use option.  Standard options do not
   contain the "@" character.  Private use options must have the PEN
   following the "@" character.  This allows a vendor or experimenter to
   have overlapping name spaces which the PEN will then uniquely
   identify.  For example the standard option of tzKnown may only have
   associated values of "0" and "1".  However tzKnown@32473 may have any
   value assigned to it by the owner of enterprise number 32473.

   Syslog transport receivers are supposed to accept all correctly
   formatted Syslog messages.  Unlike RADIUS, the receiving Syslog
   application does not have to have immediate knowledge of all variable
   options to continue operations.  If a private use option is not
   immediately known to the receiving application, it may still store
   the message and an Operator or Administrator may look it up at a
   later time if they are really interested.

4.3.  Character strings

   An alternative to using numerical indicators is to use textual
   strings.  Again, the goal for using these strings is to disambiguate
   the identifiers and allow freedom of expression by the vendors and
   experimenters using them.

4.3.1.  Secure Shell

   The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture [RFC4251] uses character
   strings rather than PENs.  Similar to Syslog, but actually predating
   it, standard options must not have the "@" character in them.
   Private use options will have an origin identifier preceding an "@"
   character followed by a name space field.  For example, in The Secure
   Shell (SSH) Connection Protocol [RFC4254] SSH channels may be opened
   by specifying a channel type when sending the SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN
   message.  Standard options for the channel type include "session" and
   "x11".  A private use option for a channel type could be
   "example_session@example.com".

   Obviously, these character strings are domain names [RFC1034]
   [RFC1035].  This is specified in The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol
   Architecture [RFC4251].  Generally, the guidance given is that if a
   private use option of this nature is not understood it is to convey
   an error code to its peer.

4.3.2.  YANG and NETCONF

   YANG - A Data Modeling Language for the Network Configuration
   Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6020] and NETCONF Configuration Protocol
   [RFC4741] use URIs to indicate private use name spaces.  The
   following is given as an example of a YANG and NETCONF configuration.

        module my-config {
            namespace "http://example.com/schema/config";
            prefix "co";

            container system { ... }
            container routing { ... }
        }

      That example could be encoded in NETCONF as the following.

        <rpc message-id="101"
             xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
             xmlns:nc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
          <edit-config>
            <target>
              <running/>
            </target>
            <config>This eternal association
              <system xmlns="http://example.com/schema/config">
                <!-- system data here -->
              </system>
              <routing xmlns="http://example.com/schema/config">
                <!-- routing data here -->
              </routing>
            </config>
          </edit-config>
        </rpc>

   Section 8.3 of YANG [RFC6020] describes the parsing of the YANG
   payload.  It contains a good deal of information about how to process
   elements or values that are not recognized.

   Similarly, NETCONF [RFC4741] contains much information about
   processing requests that cannot be completed because elements or
   values are not recognized.


5.  Characteristics of Useful Private Use Options

   This section summarizes the observed characteristics of private use
   options that are successful and deployed.

Internet-Draft             Private Use Fields                  July 2012


   There seem to be three characteristics of successful private use
   options.

5.1.  Source of Authority

   A private use option requires a path to an origin that has the
   authority to create and maintain the option.  As shown above, this
   referent should be unique, and not be dependent upon local
   interpretation.

   The PEN (Section 4.2) is sourced by the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA).  These may be viewed as being similar to domain
   names in that they are acquired by individuals, corporations, or
   other organizations.  A notable difference is that when domain names
   fall into disuse they may be acquired and used by entirely different
   people or organizations - as per the conditions required by the
   Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers [ICANN], the
   source of the domain names.  The structure of the PEN registry does
   not place any limits on the time that a PEN will be active or
   associated with the requester.  This is no different from many other
   registries maintained by the IANA; they are just a snapshot at the
   time of the reservation based on the information required by the IANA
   and provided by the supplicant.  This eternal association of the PEN,
   versus the ephemeral association of domain names, has not been shown
   to present any problems.

   Domain names have similar problems as they can be more ephemeral than
   eternal.  The top level domains are maintained by the Internet
   Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers [ICANN] however the
   specific names are assigned much more locally.  Unlike PENs that
   become unserviceable when their owning organization goes out of
   business, domain names that fall into disuse may be acquired and used
   by entirely different organizations.  Again however, like the use of
   PENs there have not been any problems reported from this.

   It is vital to note that the usage of the option within the private
   space is the full responsibility of the private entity.  In the
   example of the PEN, each entity registering a PEN must fully quantify
   the parameters of the use of the option within their purview.

5.2.  Focus of the Name Space

   Once the source of authority is established, an actual option, or
   multiple options, must be specified.  This is usually an indicator of
   what value is expected.  Within the domain established by the source
   of authority, the focus of each value must be unique.  In a very
   simple example, a private use option may consist of
   "PEN"@"focus"="value".  The PEN will be unique and will specify the



Lonvick                 Expires January 31, 2013               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft             Private Use Fields                  July 2012


   source of authority.  The focus will be unique as long as the source
   of authority maintains that uniqueness; e.g., it would be poor form
   for a private enterprise to define a focus, then to redefine it at a
   later time.

   In some cases, multiple focuses and values need to be transmitted.
   When the PEN has been used, this has most often been achieved by
   nesting tlv's within the field.  Each type is then a focus for the
   private use option.  More recently URIs have been used to point to a
   source of authority.  This allows an organization to organize an
   abundance of information about their names spaces.

5.3.  Value of the Option

   The value of each private use option must be extensible but bounded.

   Generally speaking, values of private use options should follow the
   same guidance given for standard options.

5.4.  Guidance on Incomplete Understanding

   Within the protocol, an understanding needs to be established between
   the transmitter and receiver about what to do if the receiver does
   not understand a name space.  Some protocols have defined that a
   receiver will silently discard packets that contain private use
   options they do not understand.  Other protocols have defined that
   they will only discard the private use option rather than the entire
   packet.  While other protocols have no need for the receiver to have
   any understanding of any private use options when it receives them.
   Each of these behaviors is represented in the examples in this
   document.

   Regardless of whether or not this understanding is established, the
   receiver of any protocol must have a defined path of action to follow
   when receiving anything that it may not understand.


6.  Examples of Characteristics of Useful Private Use Options

6.1.  SNMP

   The globally unique origin in SNMP (Section 4.1) is the International
   Standards Organization [ISO] which is accredited by the United
   Nations to maintain this structure.  However, the name space resolves
   to the PEN (Section 4.2).

   After the vendor identifier (the PEN) in the management information
   base (MIB), a vendor can create many different trees to identify



Lonvick                 Expires January 31, 2013               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft             Private Use Fields                  July 2012


   objects.  This may result in a very large number of OBJECT
   IDENTIFIERs; each of which is an identifier of the name space
   described in this document.  Each of these are uniquely identified by
   the vendor and do not require registration with any coordinating
   authority.

   The last part of each OBJECT IDENTIFIER is the value corresponding to
   the focus, which is known as the varbind.  In a GetRequest the server
   fills this field with a "0" and the client responds by replacing the
   "0" with the actual value.  Since this field is defined by the
   vendor, it may actually be a concatenation of values.  In a
   SetRequest transmitted to the receiver, this is the last field.

   In this, each OBJECT IDENTIFIER contains a globally unique origin
   which is ISO, a focus which is the OBJECT IDENTIFIER down to the last
   field, and a value which is the last field in the SetRequest, and the
   last field in the response to a GetRequest.

6.2.  RADIUS

   As noted above, the globally unique origin for RADIUS [RFC2865] is
   the PEN.

   The remainder of the Attribute field after the PEN is deliberately
   undefined in the specification.  It is however suggested that the
   field contain embedded tlv's.  This is again very practical and
   practicable.  Each vendor may then have conflicting "types" (e.g.
   "1") which would be disambiguated by the origin.  For example
   {PEN="N", type="1"} is different from {PEN="M", type="1"}.  Since
   there is nothing to prevent vendors from registering multiple PENs,
   each vendor may have a plethora of {type="1"}.  However, that is
   actually not needed since the focus may be extended by enumerating
   multiple types.  For example, the vendor attribute may contain
   {PEN="M", type="1"(value), type="2"(value), type="3"(value)}.

   The values for each type are bounded by the length of the attribute.
   Since the entire vendor attribute is defined by the vendor, the
   values may be human readable or not.  Since the protocol tends to be
   machine-to-machine, it is likely that the values will not be human
   readable.  In some cases, it is feasible that a value has no length.
   In that case, the transmission of the type alone, would be a signal
   of some sort to the receiver.

6.3.  Mobile IP

   The structure of the origin, type, and value of the CVSEs and NVSEs
   for Mobile IP [RFC3115] may be used in a manner very similar to that
   of RADIUS.  The PEN is the origin and types and values may be stacked



Lonvick                 Expires January 31, 2013               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft             Private Use Fields                  July 2012


   within the field following that.

   It should be noted that this does not have to be the case.
   Specifying CVSEs and NVSEs in various packets can give a vendor
   another dimension in processing these private use fields.  If a
   vendor placed all CVSEs in a single packet, and the receiver did not
   understand any one of them, the entire packet must be discarded.
   However, if the vendor places individual CVSEs in separate packets,
   only CVSEs that are not understood by the receiver will be discarded.

   Similarly, a vendor may choose to not stack NVSEs so that a receiver
   won't discard the entire cluster of NVSEs if a single one is not
   understood.

   The values are constrained by the length of the types or subtypes.

6.4.  DHCP

   The first version of the DHCP protocol [RFC2131] did not allow for
   multiple origins; only a single origin was permitted and the types
   were to be defined subsequent to that.  Evidently this was found to
   be unworkable when different vendors needed to expand private use
   options in the protocol.  After it was changed, it becomes very
   similar to CVSEs and NVSEs described in Mobile IP [RFC3115], however
   multiple uses of the PEN are still not permitted.

6.5.  Syslog

   The Syslog protocol [RFC5424] uses the PEN as the origin and allows
   for the focus of the private use option to be fully defined by the
   vendor within the structured data.  Specifically, a vendor may define
   a "type" of private use option by concatenating it with the PEN by
   using the @ character.  Within the bounds of the structured data,
   multiple elements may be used that have identifiers and values.

6.6.  Secure Shell

   In the SSH protocol [RFC4250], the origin is a domain name and the
   focus of the option is dependent upon context.  For example,
   ourcipher-cbc@example.com can only be used when negotiating ciphers,
   while example_session@example.com can only be used when negotiating
   channel types, per the examples in [RFC4250].

6.7.  YANG and NETCONF

   Both YANG [RFC6020] and NETCONF [RFC4741] use URIs to enumerate
   private use options of a device.  The use of this comes from XPATH
   [W3C.REC-xpath-19991116].

Internet-Draft             Private Use Fields                  July 2012


   In both of these, the source of authority is the domain name in the
   URI and the origin is the full URI path.  Many private use options
   may be described within YANG.  From that, each private use option may
   be populated in NETCONF.

   The following is used to demonstrate this.  First the YANG module is
   shown, then a subset of the NETCONF is shown.

                            type string;
                        }
                        leaf class {
                            type string;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }


   NETCONF exchange:

        <system>
          <login>
            <message>Good morning</message>
          </login>
        </system>

   In this example, YANG describes the source of authority and focus for
   the login message, and the NETCONF exchange populates that specific
   value.

   As noted above, both of these specifications have good descriptions
   of actions to take if a name space is not recognized.


7.  Issues to Consider

   This document is not an encouragement or recommendation to define
   private use fields in IETF protocols.  Rather, since private use
   options are useful to the community and seem to be gaining
   popularity, this document is an attempt to document the ways in which
   they have been successful so others may benefit.

   Private use options are a way to allow vendors, network operators,
   and experimenters to convey dynamic information without going through
   a rigorous process to register each variable.  There is no "one size
   fits all" mechanism.  The use of a very specific and fixed format
   works very well for RADIUS which requires speed in processing.  On
   the other hand, the open nature of the private use options in Syslog
   are appropriate for that protocol where event messages need not be
   fully parsed at the time of reception.

   There seem to be four essential features to using a private use
   option.  (The author would be grateful if the community were to
   validate these and/or offer more or less.)

Internet-Draft             Private Use Fields                  July 2012


   o  One requirement is to have a definable way for the community to
      ascertain the nature of all private use options.  For example,
      several vendors have published their RADIUS VSAs on web pages
      which are easy to find.  From that, anyone creating a new RADIUS
      server would have access to and would be able to incorporate the
      information available.

   o  Instructions are needed on how to deal with private use options
      that are not understood by a receiver.  In some cases, a receiver
      may not need to understand the options immediately upon receipt as
      in the case of Syslog.  In other cases, the options are
      immediately used and instructions must be clear on what to do if
      the receiver cannot process them.  It appears that Mobile IP has
      the best thought-through instructions on this.

   o  Private use options must be extensible in a clearly designed way.
      RADIUS suggests that the string containing the option be another
      tlv.  This allows a vendor to define multiple private use options
      within their own name space field.  These are becoming known as
      subattributes.  This appears to be working in practice and it may
      be assumed that this has become a de facto rule for RADIUS.

   o  In most cases, a subattribute will only be named once within the
      context of an exchange.  RADIUS and DHCP either state or strongly
      imply this.  However, while it is not explicitly discussed, there
      is nothing to prevent this within Syslog.  Some guidance should be
      given about this in describing private use options in protocols.

   Clear documentation in full and open standards is needed to achieve
   uniformity and interoperability in these features.  Obviously
   implementers will need to adhere closely to these standards for
   complete interoperability.

   Finally, the usage of any private use values on the wire before any
   name space is properly reserved with the IANA is entirely
   inadvisable.
