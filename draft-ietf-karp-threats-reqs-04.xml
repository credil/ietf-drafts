    <abstract>
      <t>Different routing protocols exist and each employs its own mechanism
      for securing the protocol packets on the wire. While most already have
      some method for accomplishing cryptographic message authentication, in
      many cases the existing methods are dated, vulnerable to attack, and
      employ cryptographic algorithms that have been deprecated. The "Keying
      and Authentication for Routing Protocols" (KARP) effort aims to overhaul
      and improve these mechanisms.</t>

      <t>This document does not contain protocol specifications.  Instead, it
      defines the areas where protocol specification work is needed and a set 
      of requirements for KARP design teams to follow. RFC 6518, "Keying and 
      Authentication for Routing Protocols (KARP) Design Guidelines" is a 
      companion to this document; KARP design teams will use them 
      together to review and overhaul routing protocols. These two documents 
      reflect the input of both the IETF's Security Area and Routing Area in 
      order to form a mutually agreeable work plan.</t>

      <t>This document has three main parts. The first part provides an overview
      of the KARP effort. The second part lists the threats from RFC 4593, 
      Generic Threats To Routing Protocols, that are in
      scope for attacks against routing protocols' transport systems,
      including any mechanisms built into the routing protocols themselves,
      which accomplish packet authentication.  The third part enumerates the
      requirements that routing protocol specifications must meet when addressing 
      those threats for RFC 6518's "Work Phase 1", the update to a routing 
      protocol's existing transport security.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In March 2006 the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop
      on the topic of "Unwanted Internet Traffic". The report from that
      workshop is documented in <xref target="RFC4948"></xref>. Section 8.1 of
      that document states "A simple risk analysis would suggest that an ideal
      attack target of minimal cost but maximal disruption is the core routing
      infrastructure." Section 8.2 calls for "[t]ightening the security of the
      core routing infrastructure." Four main steps were identified for that
      tightening:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Create secure mechanisms and practices for operating routers.</t>

          <t>Clean up the Internet Routing Registry repository (IRR), and
          securing both the database and the access, so that it can be used
          for routing verification.</t>

          <t>Create specifications for cryptographic validation of routing
          message content.</t>

          <t>Secure the routing protocols' packets on the wire</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The first bullet is being addressed in the OPSEC working group. The
      second bullet should be addressed through liaisons with those running
      the IRR's globally. The third bullet is being addressed in the SIDR
      working group.</t>

      <t>This document addresses the last item in the list above, securing the
      transmission of routing protocol packets on the wire, or rather securing
      the routing protocols' transport systems, including any mechanisms built
      into the routing protocols themselves which accomplish packet
      authentication. This effort is referred to as Keying and Authentication 
      for Routing
      Protocols, or "KARP". KARP is concerned with issues and techniques for
      protecting the messages and their contents between directly
      communicating peers. This may overlap with, but is strongly distinct
      from, protection designed to ensure that routing information is properly
      authorized relative to sources of information. Such assurances are
      provided by other mechanisms and are outside the scope of this document
      and work that relies on it.</t>

      <t>This document is one of two that together form the guidance and
      instructions for KARP design teams working to overhaul routing protocol
      transport security. The other document is the KARP Design Guide <xref
      target="RFC6518"> </xref>.</t>

      <t>This document does not contain protocol specifications.  Instead, its
      goal is to define the areas where protocol specification 
      work is needed and to provide a set 
      of requirements for KARP design teams to follow as they tackle <xref
      target="RFC6518"> </xref>, Section 4.1's "Work Phase 1", the update
      to a routing protocol's existing transport security. </t>

      <t>This document has three main parts. The first part, found in Section 2, 
      provides an overview of the KARP effort. Section 3 lists the threats from 
      <xref target="RFC4593"></xref>, Generic Threats To Routing Protocols, 
      that are in
      scope for routing protocols' transport systems' per packet authentication.  
      Therefore, this document does not
      contain a complete threat model; it simply points to the parts of the
      governing threat model that KARP design teams must address, and
      explicitly states which parts are out of scope for KARP design
      teams. Section 4 enumerates the
      requirements that routing protocol specifications must meet when addressing 
      those threats related to KARP's "Work Phase 1", the update
      to a routing protocol's existing transport security. ("Work Phase 2", 
      a framework and usage of a KMP, will be addressed in a future 
      requirements document).</t>

      <t>This document uses the terminology "on the wire" to refer to the
      information used by routing protocols' transport systems. This term is
      widely used in IETF RFCs, but is used in several different ways. In this
      document, it is used to refer both to information exchanged between
      routing protocol instances, and to underlying protocols that may also
      need to be protected in specific circumstances. Individual protocol
      analysis documents will need to be more specific in their usage."</t>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>Within the scope of this document, the following words, when
        beginning with a capital letter, or spelled in all capitals, hold the
        meanings described to the right of each term. If the same word is used
        uncapitalized, then it is intended to have its common English
        definition.</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">


            <t>Identifier</t>

            <t>The type and value used by a peer of an authenticated message
            exchange to signify who it is to another peer. The Identifier is
            used by the receiver as an index into a table containing further
            information about the peer that is required to continue processing
            the message, for example a Security Association (SA) or keys.</t>


            <t>Identity Authentication</t>

            <t>Once the identity is decided, then there must be a
            cryptographic proof of that identity, that the peer really is who
            it asserts to be. Proof of identity can be arranged among peers in
            a few ways, for example symmetric and asymmetric pre-shared keys,
            or an assymetric key containted in a certificate. Certificates can
            be used in ways that requires no additional supporting systems
            external to the routers themselves. An example of this would be
            using self signed certificates and a flat file list of "approved
            thumbprints". The use of these different identity authentication
            mechanisms vary in ease of deployment, ease of ongoing management,
            startup effort, ongoing effort and management, security strength,
            and consequences from loss of secrets from one part of the system
            to the rest of the system. For example, they differ in resistance
            to a security breach, and the effort required to remediate the
            whole system in the event of such a breach. The point here is that
            there are options, many of which are quite simple to employ and
            deploy.</t>


            <t>KDF (Key derivation function)</t>

            <t>A KDF is a function in which an input key and other input data
            is used to generate (or derive) keying material that can be
            employed by cryptographic algorithms. The key that is input to a
            KDF is called a key derivation key. KDFs can be used to generate
            one or more keys from either (i) a truly random or pseudorandom
            seed value or (ii) result of the Diffie-Hellman exchange or (iii)
            a non-uniform random source or (iv) a pre-shared key which may or
            may not be memorable by a human.</t>


           <t>KMP (Key Management Protocol)</t>

            <t>A protocol to establish a shared symmetric key between a pair
            (or a group) of users. It determines how secret keys are generated
            and made available to both the parties. If session or traffic keys
            are being used, KMP is responsible for generating them and
            determining when they should be renewed.</t>

            <t>A KMP is helpful because it negotiates unique, random keys
            without administrator involvement. It also negotiates, as
            mentioned earlier, several of the SA parameters required for the
            secure connection, including key life times. It keeps track of
            those lifetimes, and negotiates new keys and parameters before
            they expire, again, without administrator interaction.
            Additionally, in the event of a security breach, changing KMP
            authentication credentials will immediately cause a rekey to occur
            for the Traffic Keys, and new Traffic Keys will be installed and
            used in the current connection.</t>


            <t>KMP Function</t>

            <t>Any actual KMP used in the general KARP solution framework</t>


            <t>Peer Key</t>

            <t>Keys that are used among peers as a basis for identifying one
            another. These keys may or may not be connection-specific,
            depending on how they were established, and what forms of identity
            and identity authentication mechanism used in the system. A peer
            key generally would be provided by a KMP that would later be used
            to derive fresh traffic keys.</t>


            <t>PRF</t>

            <t>In cryptography, a pseudorandom function, abbreviated PRF, is a
            collection of efficiently-computable functions which emulate a
            random oracle in the following way: No efficient algorithm can
            distinguish (with significant advantage) between a function chosen
            randomly from the PRF family and a random oracle (a function whose
            outputs are determined at random). Informally, a PRF takes a
            secret key and a set of input values and produces random-seeming
            output values for each input value.</t>


            <t>PSK (Pre-Shared Key)</t>

            <t>A key used to communicate with one or more peers in a secure
            configuration. Always distributed out-of-band prior to a first
            connection.</t>


            <t>Routing Protocol</t>

            <t>When used with capital "R" and "P" in this document the term
            refers the Routing Protocol for which work is being done to
            provide or enhance its peer authentication mechanisms.</t>

            
            <t>SA (Security Association)</t>

            <t>A relationship established between two or more entities to
            enable them to protect data they exchange. Examples of items that
            may exist in an SA include: Identifier, PSK, Traffic Key,
            cryptographic algorithms, key lifetimes.</t>


            <t>Traffic Key</t>

            <t>The key (or one of a set of keys) used for protecting the
            routing protocol traffic. Since the traffic keys used in a
            particular connection are not a fixed part of a device
            configuration no data exists anywhere else in the operator's
            systems which can be stolen, e.g. in the case of a terminated or
            turned employee. If a server or other data store is stolen or
            compromised, the thieves gain no access to current traffic keys.
            They may gain access to key derivation material, like a PSK, but
            not current traffic keys in use.</t>

    <section title="KARP Effort Overview">
      <section title="KARP Scope">
        <t>Three basic services may be employed in order to secure any piece
        of data as it is transmitted over the wire: confidentiality,
        authenticity, or integrity. The focus for the KARP working group will
        be message authentication and message integrity only. This work
        explicitly excludes, at this point in time, privacy services.
        Non-repudiation is also excluded as a goal at this time. Since the
        objective of most routing protocols is to broadly advertise the
        routing topology, routing protocol packets are commonly sent in the
        clear; confidentiality is not normally required for routing protocols.
        However, ensuring that routing peers are authentically identified, and
        that no rogue peers or unauthenticated packets can compromise the
        stability of the routing environment is critical, and thus our focus.
        Confidentiality and non-repudiation may be addressed in future
        work.</t>

        <t>OSPF <xref target="RFC5709"> </xref>, IS-IS <xref target="RFC5310">
        </xref>, LDP <xref target="RFC5036"> </xref>, and RIP <xref
        target="RFC2453"> </xref> <xref target="RFC4822"> </xref> already have
        existing mechanisms for cryptographically authenticating and integrity
        checking the messages on the wire. Products with these mechanisms have
        been produced, code has been written, and both have been optimized for
        these existing security mechanisms. Rather than turn away from these
        mechanisms, this document aims to enhance them, updating them to
        modern and secure levels.</t>

        <t>Therefore, the scope of KARP's roadmap of work includes:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Making use of existing routing protocol transport security
            mechanisms, where they exist, and enhancing or updating them as
            necessary for modern cryptographic best practices. 
            <xref target="RFC6518"> </xref>, Section 4.1 labels this KARP's "Work 
            Phase 1."</t>

            <t>Developing a framework for using automatic key management in
            order to ease deployment, lower cost of operation, and allow for
            rapid responses to security breaches. <xref target="RFC6518"> </xref>, 
            Section 4.1 labels this KARP's "Work 
            Phase 2."</t>

            <t>Specifying an automated key management protocol that may be
            combined with the bits-on-the-wire mechanisms.
            <xref target="RFC6518"> </xref>, Section 4.1 labels this KARP's "Work 
            Phase 2."</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Neither this document nor <xref target="RFC6518"> </xref> contain 
        protocol specifications. Instead, they
        define the areas where protocol specification work is needed and set
        a direction, a set of requirements, and priorities for addressing that
        specification work.</t>

        <t>There are a set of threats to routing protocols that are considered
        in-scope for KARP, and a set considered out-of- scope. These
        are described in detail in the Threats (Section 3) section below.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Incremental Approach">
        <t>The work also serves as an agreement between the Routing Area and
        the Security Area about the priorities and work plan for incrementally
        delivering the above work. The principle of "crawl, walk, run" will be
        employed. Thus routing protocol authentication mechanisms may not go
        immediately from their current state to a state reflecting the best
        possible, most modern security practices. This point is important as
        there will be times when the best-security-possible will give way to
        vastly-improved-over-current-security-but-admittedly-not-yet-best-
        security-possible, in order that incremental progress toward a more
        secure Internet may be achieved. As such, this document will call out
        places where agreement has been reached on such trade offs.</t>

        <t>Incremental steps will need to be taken for a few very practical
        reasons. First, there are a considerable number of deployed routing
        devices in operating networks that will not be able to run the most
        modern cryptographic mechanisms without significant and unacceptable
        performance penalties. The roadmap for any one routing protocol MUST
        allow for incremental improvements on existing operational devices.
        Second, current routing protocol performance on deployed devices has
        been achieved over the last 20 years through extensive tuning of
        software and hardware elements, and is a constant focus for
        improvement by vendors and operators alike. The introduction of new
        security mechanisms affects this performance balance. The performance
        impact of any incremental step of security improvement will need to be
        weighed by the community, and introduced in such a way that allows the
        vendor and operator community a path to adoption that upholds
        reasonable performance metrics. Therefore, certain specification
        elements may be introduced carrying the "SHOULD" guidance, with the
        intention that the same mechanism will carry a "MUST" in a future
        release of the specification.</t>

        <t>This approach gives the vendors and implementors the guidance they
        need to tune their software and hardware appropriately over time.
        Last, some security mechanisms require the build out of other
        operational support systems, and this will take time. An example where
        these three reasons are at play in an incremental improvement roadmap
        is seen in the improvement of BGP's <xref target="RFC4271"> </xref>
        security via the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) <xref
        target="RFC5925"> </xref> effort. It would be ideal, and reflect best
        common security practice, to have a fully specified key management
        protocol for negotiating TCP-AO's keying material, e.g., using
        certificates for peer authentication. However, in the spirit of
        incremental deployment, we will first address issues like
        cryptographic algorithm agility, replay attacks, TCP session resetting
        in the base TCP-AO protocol before we layer key management on top of
        it.</t>

        <t>However, in the spirit of incremental deployment, we will first
        address issues like cryptographic algorithm agility, replay attacks,
        TCP session resetting in the base TCP-AO protocol before we layer key
        management on top of it.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Goals">
        <t>The goals and general guidance for the KARP work follow.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Provide authentication and integrity protection for messages on
            the wire of existing routing protocols.</t>

            <t>Define a path to incrementally improve security of the routing
            infrastructure as explained in the earlier sections.</t>

            <t>Ensure that the improved security solutions on currently
            running routing infrastructure equipment are deployable. This begs
            the consideration of the current state of processing power
            available on routers in the network today.</t>

            <t>Operational deployability - A solution's acceptability will
            also be measured by how deployable the solution is by common
            operator teams using common deployment processes and
            infrastructures. Specifically, we will try to make these solutions
            fit as well as possible into current operational practices and
            router deployment. This will be heavily influenced by operator
            input, to ensure that what we specify can -- and, more
            importantly, will -- be deployed once specified and implemented by
            vendors. Deployment of incrementally more secure routing
            infrastructure in the Internet is the final measure of success.
            Measurably, we would like to see an increase in the number of
            surveyed respondents who report deploying the updated
            authentication and integrity mechanisms in their networks, as well
            as a sharp rise in usage for the total percentage of their
            network's routers. <vspace blankLines="1" /> Interviews with
            operators show several points about routing security. First, over
            70% of operators have deployed transport connection protection via
            TCP-MD5 <xref target="RFC3562"> </xref> on their exterior Border
            Gateway Protocol (eBGP) <xref target="ISR2008"></xref> sessions.
            Over 55% also deploy TCP-MD5 on their interior Border Gateway
            Protoco (iBGP connections, and 50% make use of TCP-MD5 offered on
            some other internal gateway protocol (IGP). The survey states that
            "a considerable increase was observed over previous editions of
            the survey for use of TCP MD5 with external peers (eBGP), internal
            peers (iBGP) and MD5 extensions for IGPs." Though the data is not
            captured in the report, the authors believe anecdotally that of
            those who have deployed TCP-MD5 somewhere in their network, only
            about 25-30% of the routers in their network are deployed with the
            authentication enabled. None report using IPsec <xref
            target="RFC4301"> </xref> to protect the routing protocol, and
            this was a decline from the few that reported doing so in the
            previous year's report. From our personal conversations with
            operators, of those using MD5, almost all report using one,
            manually-distributed key throughout the entire network. These same
            operators report that the single key has not been changed since it
            was originally installed, sometimes five or more years ago. When
            asked why, particularly for the case of protecting BGP sessions
            using TCP MD5, the following reasons are often given: <list
                style="hanging">
                <t hangText="A.">Changing the keys triggers a TCP reset, and
                thus bounces the links/adjacencies, undermining Service Level

                on a per peer/AS basis. The coordination is very cumbersome
                and tedious to execute in practice.</t>

                <t hangText="C.">Keys must be changed at precisely the same
                time, or at least within 60 seconds (as supported by two major

                is incredibly difficult to do, operationally, especially

                device-by-device basis.</t>

                <t hangText="F.">There are three use cases for operational
                peering at play here: peers and interconnection with other
                operators, iBGP, and other routing sessions within a single
                operator, and operator-to-customer devices. All three have
                very different properties, and all are reported as cumbersome.
                One operator reported that the same key is used for all
                customer premise equipment (CPE). The same operator reported
                that if the customer mandated it, a unique key could be
                created, although the last time this occurred it created such
                an operational headache that the administrators now usually
                tell customers that the option doesn't even exist, to avoid
                the difficulties. These customer-unique keys are never
                changed, unless the customer demands so. The main threat at
                play here is that a terminated employee from such an operator
                who had access to the one (or several) keys used for
                authentication in these environments could easily wage an
                attack. Alternatively, the operator could offer the keys to
                others who would wage the attack. In either case, the attacker
                could then bring down many of the adjacencies, causing
                destabilization to the routing system.</t>

            <t>Whatever mechanisms KARP specifies need to be easier to deploy
            than the current methods, and should provide obvious operational
            efficiency gains along with significantly better security and
            threat protection. This combination of value may be enough to
            drive much broader adoption.</t>

            <t>Address the threats enumerated below in the "Threats" section
            (Section 3) for each routing protocol. Not all threats may be able
            to be addressed in the first specification update for any one
            protocol. Roadmaps will be defined so that both the security area
            and the routing area agree on how the threats will be addressed
            completely over time.</t>

            <t>Create a re-usable architecture, framework, and guidelines for
            various IETF working groups who will address these security
            improvements for various Routing Protocols. The crux of the KARP
            work is to re-use the architecture, guidelines and the framework
            as much as possible across relevant Routing Protocols. For
            example, designers should aim to re-use the key management
            protocol that will be defined for BGP's TCP-AO key establishment
            for as many other routing protocols as possible.</t>

            <t>Routing Area working group chairs and participants - These
            people are charged with updates to the Routing Protocol
            specifications. Any and all cryptographic authentication work on
            these specifications will occur in Routing Area working groups,
            with close partnership with the Security Area. Co-advisors from
            the Security Area may often be named for these partnership
            efforts.</t>

            <t>Security Area reviewers of routing area documents - These
            people are delegated by the Security Area Directors to perform
            reviews on routing protocol specifications as they pass through
            working group last call or IESG review. They will pay particular
            attention to the use of cryptographic authentication and newly
            specified security mechanisms for the routing protocols. They will
            ensure that incremental security improvements are being made, in

            either due to lack of value or perceived (or real) over-
            complexity of operations. As a result, the GROW and OPSEC WGs

      <t>This section defines the threats that are in scope for the KARP

      for the KARP effort.</t>

      <t>This document leverages the "Generic Threats to Routing Protocols"

      were derived by reviewing <xref target="RFC4593"></xref>,
      analyzing the KARP problem space relative to it, and simply listing the 
      threats that are applicable to the KARP design teams' work. This document

      threats into those in scope and those out of scope for KARP. Each in-scope 
      threat is discussed below, and its applicability
      to the KARP problem space is described. As such, the below text
      intentionally does not constitute a self-standing, complete threat

      <section anchor="Threat_Sources" title="Threat Sources">
  
        <section anchor="outsiders" title="OUTSIDERS">
        <t>One of the threats that will be addressed in this roadmap are those where
        the source is an OUTSIDER. An OUTSIDER attacker may reside anywhere in
        the Internet, have the ability to send IP traffic to the router, may
        be able to observe the router's replies, and may even control the path
        for a legitimate peer's traffic. OUTSIDERS are not legitimate
        participants in the routing protocol. The use of message
        authentication and integrity protection specifically aims to identify
        packets originating from OUTSIDERS.</t>

        <t>KARP design teams will consider two specific use cases of
        OUTSIDERS: those on-path, and those off-path.</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>On-Path - These sources have control of a network resource or a 
            tap that sits along the path of packets between the two routing peers. 
            A "Man-in-the-Middle" (MitM) is an on-path attacker. From this vantage
            point, the attacker can conduct either active or passive attacks.
            An active attack occurs when the attacker actually places packets on
            the network as part of the attack. One active MitM attack relevant to 
            KARP, an active
            wiretapping attack, occurs when the attacker tampers with packets
            moving between two legitimate router peers in such a way that both
            peers think they are talking to each other directly, when in fact
            they are actually talking to the attacker only. Protocols
            conforming to this roadmap will use cryptographic mechanisms to
            detect MitM attacks and reject packets from such attacks (i.e.
            treat them as not authentic). Passive on-path attacks occur when the
            attacker silently gathers data and analyses it to gain advantage. 
            Passive activity by an on-path attacker may often eventually lead to
            an active attack.</t>

            <t>Off-Path - These sources sit on some network outside of that over
            which runs the packets between two routing peers. The source may be one
            or several hops away. Off-path attackers can launch active attacks, such
            as SPOOFING or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, to name a few.</t>
          </list></t> 
        </section><!end OUTSIDERS>

        <section anchor="Stolen_Keys" title="Stolen Keys">
	<t> This threat source exists when an unauthorized entity somehow manages 
        to gain access to keying material. Using this material, the attacker could 
        send packets that pass the authenticity checks based on message 
        authentication codes (MACs).  The resulting traffic might appear to come 
        from router A to router B, and thus the attacker could
        impersonate an authorized peer.  The attacker could then adversely affect
        network behavior by sending bogus messages that appear to be authentic. The
        attack source possessing the stolen keys could be on-path, off-path, or
        both.</t>

        <t>The obvious mitigation for stolen keys is to change the keys currently
        in use by the legitimate routing peers. This mitigation can be either 
        reactive or pro-active. Reactive mitigation occurs when keys are changed only 
        after having discovered that the previous keys fell into the possession of 
        unauthorized users. The stolen keys, reactive mitigation case is highlighted 
        here in order to explain a common operational situation where new
        keying material will become necessary with little or no advanced warning. In 
        such a case new keys must be able to be installed and put into use very
        quickly, and with little operational expense. Pro-active mitigation occurs
        when an operator assumes that unauthorized possession will occur from time to
        time without being discovered, and the operator moves to new keying material 
        in order to cut short, or make nonexistent, an attacker's window of 
        opportunity to use the stolen keys effectively.</t>

        <t>In KARP, we can address the attack source with stolen keys by 
        creating specifications that make it practical for the operator to quickly 
        change keys without disruption to the routing system, and with minimal 
        operational overhead. Operators can further mitigate the stolen keys 
        case by habitually changing keys.</t>

          <section anchor="Terminated_Employee" title="Terminated Employee">
	  <t>A terminated employee is an important example of a "stolen keys" threat source to consider. Staff attrition is a reality in routing operations, and so regularly causes the potential for a threat source. The threat source risk arises when a network operator who had been granted access to keys ceases to be an employee. If new keys are deployed immediately, the situation of a terminated employee can become a "stolen keys, pro-active" case, as described above, rather than a "stolen keys, reactive" case.</t>

<t>On one hand, terminated employees could be considered INSIDERS rather than OUTSIDERS, because at one point in time they were authorized to have the keys. On the other hand, they aren't really a BYZANTINE attacker, which is defined to be an attack from an INSIDER, a legitimate router. Further, once terminated, the authorization granted to the terminated employee regarding the keys is revoked. If they maintain possession of the keys they are acting in an unauthorized way. If they go on to use those keys to launch an attack they are definitely acting in an unauthorized way. In this way the terminated employee becomes an OUTSIDER at the point of termination, they cease to be legitimate participants in the routing system. It behooves the operator to change the keys, to enforce the revocation of authorization of the old keys, in order to minimize the threat source's window of opportunity.</t>

<t>Regardless of whether one considers a terminated employee an "insider" or an OUTSIDER, it is important to consider them a threat source, study the use case, and address the threats therein. In such a case within the KARP context, new keys must be able to be installed and made operational in the routing protocols very quickly, with zero impact to the routing system, and with little operational expense.</t>  

<t>The threat source of the terminated employee and/or the detected-stolen-keys drives the requirement for quick and easy key rollover. The threat actions associated with these sources are mitigated if the operator has mechanisms in place (both inherent in the protocol, as well as built into their management systems) that allow them to roll the keys quickly with minimal impact to the routing system, at low operational cost.</t>

      <section anchor="inscope" title="Threat Actions In Scope">
        <t>These ATTACK ACTIONS are in scope for KARP:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>SPOOFING - when an unauthorized device assumes the identity of
            an authorized one. SPOOFING can be used, for example, to inject
            malicious routing information that causes the disruption of
            network services. SPOOFING can also be used to cause a neighbor
            relationship to form that subsequently denies the formation of the
            relationship with the legitimate router.</t>

  <t>DoS attacks at the transport layer - This is an example of SPOOFING.  It can also be an example of FALSIFICATION and INTERFERENCE (see below). It occurs when an attacker
            sends spoofed packets aimed at halting or preventing the
            underlying protocol over which the routing protocol runs. For
            example, BGP running over TLS will still not solve the problem of
            being able to send a spoofed TCP FIN or TCP RST and causing the BGP
            session to go down. Since this attack depends on spoofing,
            operators are encouraged to deploy proper authentication
            mechanisms to prevent such attacks. Specification work should
            ensure that Routing Protocols can operate over transport
            sub-systems in a fashion that is resilient to such DoS
            attacks.</t>

            <t>FALSIFICATION - an action whereby an attacker sends false
            routing information. To falsify the routing information, an
            attacker has to be either the originator or a forwarder of the
            routing information. FALSIFICATION may occur by an ORIGINATOR, or
            a FORWARDER, and may involve OVERCLAIMING, MISCLAIMING, or
            MISTATEMENT of network resource reachability. We must be careful
            to remember that in this work we are only targeting FALSIFICATION
            from OUTSIDERS as may occur from tampering with packets in flight,
            or sending entirely false messages. FALSIFICATION from BYZANTINES
            (see the Threats Out of Scope section below) are not
            addressed by the KARP effort.</t>

            <t>INTERFERENCE - when an attacker inhibits the exchanges by
            legitimate routers. The types of INTERFERENCE addressed by this
            work include: <list style="letters">
                <t>ADDING NOISE</t>

                <t>REPLAYING OUT-DATED PACKETS</t>

                <t>INSERTING MESSAGES</t>

                <t>CORRUPTING MESSAGES</t>

                <t>BREAKING SYNCHRONIZATION</t>

                <t>Changing message content</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>DoS attacks using the authentication mechanism - This includes
            an attacker sending packets that confuse or overwhelm a security
            mechanism itself. An example is initiating an overwhelming load of
            spoofed routing protocol packets that contain a MAC, so that the
            receiver needs to spend the processing cycles to check the MAC,
            only to discard the spoofed packet, consuming substantial CPU
            resources. Another example is when an attacker sends an
            overwhelming load of keying protocol initiations from bogus
            sources.</t>

            <t>Brute Force Attacks Against Password/Keys - This includes
            either online or offline attacks where attempts are made
            repeatedly using different keys/passwords until a match is found.
            While it is impossible to make brute force attacks on keys
            completely unsuccessful, proper design can make such attacks much
            harder to succeed. For example, the key length should be
            sufficiently long so that covering the entire space of possible
            keys is improbable using computational power expected to be
            available 10 years out or more. Using per session keys is another
            widely used method for reducing the number of brute force attacks
            as this would make it difficult to guess the keys.</t>

      <section title="Threat Actions Out of Scope">
        <t>Threats from BYZANTINE sources -- faulty, misconfigured, or
        subverted routers, i.e., legitimate participants in the routing
        protocol -- are out of scope for this roadmap. Any of the attacks
        described in the above section (Section 2.1) that may be levied by a
        BYZANTINE source are therefore also out of scope, e.g. FALSIFICATION,
        or unauthorized message content by a legitimate authorized peer.</t>

            to prevent the gathering of data needed to perform an off-path

                <t>DoS attacks not involving the routing protocol. For
                example, a flood of traffic that fills the link ahead of the
                router, so that the router is rendered unusable and
                unreachable by valid packets is NOT an attack that KARP will
                address. Many such examples could be contrived.</t>

    <section title="Requirements for KARP Work Phase 1, the Update to a Routing 
    Protocol's Existing Transport Security">
      <t>The KARP Design Guide <xref target="RFC6518"> </xref>, Section 4.1 
      describes two distinct work phases for the KARP effort. This section 
      addresses requirements for the first work phase only, "Work Phase 1", 
      the update to a routing protocol's existing transport security. "Work Phase
      2", a framework and usage of a KMP, will be addressed in a future requirements 
      document."</t>

      <t>The following list of requirements SHOULD be addressed by a KARP Work
      Phase 1 security update to any Routing Protocol (according to section
      4.1 of the KARP Design Guide <xref target="RFC6518"> </xref>document).
      IT IS RECOMMENDED that any Work Phase 1 security update to a Routing Protocol
      contain a section of the specification document that describes how each
      of the below requirements are met. It is further RECOMMENDED that
      justification be presented for any requirements that are NOT
      addressed.</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Clear definitions of which elements of the transmitted data
          (frame, packet, segment, etc.) are protected by the authentication
          mechanism</t>

          <t>Strong cryptographic algorithms, as defined and accepted by the
          IETF security community, MUST be specified. The use of non-standard
          or unpublished algorithms SHOULD BE avoided.</t>

          <t>Algorithm agility for the cryptographic algorithms used in the
          authentication MUST be specified, i.e. more than one algorithm MUST
          be specified and it MUST be clear how new algorithms MAY be
          specified and used within the protocol. This requirement exists
          because research identifying weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms
          can cause the security community to reduce confidence in some
          algorithms. Breaking a cipher isn't a matter of if, but when it will
          occur. Having the ability to specify alternate algorithms (algorithm
          agility) within the protocol specification to support such an event
          is essential. Mandating two algorithms provides both a redundancy,
          and a mechanism for enacting that redundancy when needed. Further,
          the mechanism MUST describe the generic interface for new
          cryptographic algorithms to be used, so that implementers can use
          algorithms other than those specified, and so that new algorithms
          may be specified and supported in the future.</t>

          <t>Secure use of PSKs, offering both operational convenience and a
          baseline level of security, MUST be specified.</t>

          <t>Routing protocols should be able to detect and reject replayed
          messages. For non TCP based protocols like OSPF <xref
          target="RFC2328"></xref>, IS-IS <xref target="RFC1195"></xref> ,
          etc., two routers are said to have a session up if they are able to
          exchange protocol packets. Packets captured from one session must
          not be able to be re-sent and accepted during a later session.
          Additionally, replay mechanisms must work correctly even in the
          presence of routing protocol packet prioritization by the
          router.<list style="letters"> 

              <t>There is a specific case of replay attack combined with spoofing that must be addressed. In several routing protocols (e.g., OSPF <xref
          target="RFC2328"></xref>, IS-IS <xref target="RFC1195"></xref>, BFD
          <xref target="RFC5880"></xref>, RIP <xref target="RFC2453"></xref>,
          etc.), all speakers share the same key (K) on a broadcast segment.
          The ability to run a MAC operation with K is used for identity validation, and (currently) no
          other identity validation check is performed. Assume there are four routers using authentication on a LAN, R1 - R4. Also assume attacker "Z", who is NOT a legitimate neighbor, is observing and recording packets on the same LAN segment. Z captures a packet from R1, and changes the source IP, spoofing it to that of R2, then sends the packet on the LAN. Z does not have K, but in this case it does not matter because R1 already performed the MAC operation, and Z simply re-uses that MAC. R3 and R4 will process the packet as if coming from R2, the MAC check will return valid, and they will update their route tables accordingly. R3 and R4 have confirmed that the MAC was created by someone holding K, but not that it was actually sent by R2. This is a well known attack with known solutions. Some string must be added into the MAC operation that uniquely identifies the sender. Said string must also be located in the packet such that if that string were to be altered after the MAC operation, it would be detected by the receiver. Examples of solutions used in other protocols include sequence numbers with sliding acceptance windows, time stamps, IP header info (SRC, DST), unique identifiers which are temporarily bound to an IP Address.</t>
</list></t>

          <t>A change of security parameters REQUIRES, and even forces, a
          change of session traffic keys. The specific security parameters for
          the various routing protocols will differ, and will be defined by
          each protocols design team. Some examples may include: master key,
          key lifetime, cryptographic algorithm, etc. If one of these
          configured parameters changes, then a new session traffic key must
          immediately be established using the updated parameters. The routing
          protocol security mechanisms MUST support this behavior.</t>

          <t>Intra-session re-keying which occurs without a break or
          interruption to the current routing session, and, if possible,
          without data loss, MUST be specified. Keys need to be changed
          periodically, for operational confidentiality (e.g. when an
          administrator who had access to the keys leaves an organization) and
          for entropy purposes, and a re-keying mechanism enables the
          operators to execute the change without productivity loss.</t>

          <t>Efficient re-keying SHOULD be provided. The specification SHOULD
          support rekeying during a session without needing to try/compute
          multiple keys on a given packet. The rare exception will occur if a
          routing protocols design team can find no other way to re-key and
          still adhere to the other requirements in this section.</t>

          <t>New mechanisms must resist DoS attacks described as in-scope in
          <xref target="inscope"></xref>. Routers protect the control plane by
          implementing mechanisms to filter completely or rate limit traffic
          not required at the control plane level (i.e., unwanted traffic).
          Typically line rate packet filtering capabilities look at
          information at or below the IP and transport (TCP or UDP) headers,
          but do not include higher layer information. Therefore the new
          mechanisms shouldn't hide nor encrypt the information carried in the
          IP and transport layers in control plane packets.</t>

          <t>Mandatory cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms MUST be
          specified for a routing protocol. Further, the protocol
          specification MUST define default security mechanism settings for
          all implementations to use when no explicit configuration is
          provided. To understand the need for this requirement, consider the
          case where a routing protocol mandates 3 different cryptographic
          algorithms for a MAC operation. If company A implements algorithm 1
          as the default for this protocol, while company B implements
          algorithm 2 as the default, then two operators who enable the
          security mechanism with no explicit configuration other than a PSK
          will experience a connection failure. It is not enough that each
          implementation implement the 3 mandatory algorithms; one default
          must further be specified in order to gain maximum out-of-the-box
          interoperability.</t>

          <t>For backward compatibility reasons manual keying MUST be
          supported.</t>

          <t>Architecture of the specification SHOULD consider and allow for
          future use of a KMP.</t>

          <t>The authentication mechanism in the Routing Protocol MUST be
          decoupled from the key management system used. It MUST be obvious
          how the keying material was obtained, and the process for obtaining
          the keying material MUST exist outside of the Routing Protocol. This
          will allow for the various key generation methods, like manual keys
          and KMPs, to be used with the same Routing Protocol mechanism.</t>

          <t>Convergence times of the Routing Protocols SHOULD NOT be
          materially affected. "Materially" is defined here as anything greater than a 5% increase in convergence time. Changes in the convergence time will be immediately verifiable by convergence performance test beds already in use by most router vendors and service providers. Note that convergence is different than boot
          time. Also note that convergence time has a lot to do with the speed
          of processors used on individual routing peers, and this processing
          power increases by Moore's law over time, meaning that the same
          route calculations and table population routines will decrease in
          duration over time. Therefore, this requirement should be considered
          only in terms of total number of protocol packets that must be
          exchanged, and less for the computational intensity of processing
          any one message. Alternatively this can be simplified by saying that
          the new mechanisms should only result in a minimal increase in the
          number of routing protocol packets passed between the peers.</t>

          <t>The changes to or addition of security mechanisms SHOULD NOT
          cause a refresh of route advertisements or cause additional route
          advertisments to be generated.</t>

          <t>Router implementations provide prioritized treatment for certain
          protocol packets. For example, OSPF HELLO packets and ACKs are
          prioritized for processing above other OSPF packets. The security
          mechanism SHOULD NOT interfere with the ability to observe and
          enforce such prioritization. Any effect on such priority mechanisms
          MUST be explicitly documented and justified. Replay protection
          mechanisms provided by the routing protocols MUST work even if
          certain protocol packets are offered prioritized treatment.</t>

          <t>Routing protocols MUST only send minimal information regarding
          the authentication mechanisms and the parameters in its protocol
          packets. One reason for this is to keep the Routing Protocols as
          clean and focused as possible, and load security negotiations into
          the future KMP as much as possible. Another reason is to avoid
          exposing any security negotiation information unnecessarily to
          possible attackers on the path.</t>

          <t>Routing protocols that rely on the IP header (or information
          seperate from routing protocol payload) to identify the neighbor
          that originated the packet, MUST either protect the IP header or
          provide some other means to authenticate the neighbor. <xref
          target="RFC6039"></xref> describes some attacks that are based on
          this.</t>

          <t>Every new KARP-developed security mechanisms MUST support
          incremental deployment. It will not be feasible to deploy a new
          Routing Protocol authentication mechanism throughout a network
          instantaneously. It also may not be possible to deploy such a
          mechanism to all routers in a large autonomous system (AS) at one
          time. Proposed solutions MUST support an incremental deployment
          method that provides some benefit for those who participate. Because
          of this, there are several requirements that any proposed KARP
          mechanism should consider. 
              <list style="letters">
              <t>The Routing Protocol security mechanism MUST enable each
              router to configure use of the security mechanism on a per- peer
              basis where the communication is peer-to-peer (unicast).</t>

              <t>Every new KARP-developed security mechanism MUST provide
              backward compatibility in the message formatting, transmission,
              and processing of routing information carried through a mixed
              security environment. Message formatting in a fully secured
              environment MAY be handled in a non-backward compatible fashion
              though care must be taken to ensure that routing protocol
              packets can traverse intermediate routers that don't support the
              new format.</t>

              <t>In an environment where both secured and non-secured systems
              are interoperating, a mechanism MUST exist for secured systems
              to identify whether a peer intended the messages to be
              secured.</t>

              <t>In an environment where secured service is in the process of
              being deployed, a mechanism MUST exist to support a transition
              free of service interruption (caused by the deployment per
              se).</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The introduction of mechanisms to improve routing security may
          increase the processing performed by a router. Since most of the
          currently deployed routers do not have hardware to accelerate
          cryptographic operations, these operations could impose a
          significant processing burden under some circumstances. Thus
          proposed solutions should be evaluated carefully with regard to the
          processing burden they may impose, since deployment may be impeded
          if network operators perceive that a solution will impose a
          processing burden which either incurs substantial capital expense,
          or threatens to destabilize routers.</t>

          <t>Given the number of routers that would require the new
          authentication mechanisms in a typical ISP deployment, solutions can
          increase their appeal by minimizing the burden imposed on all
          routers in favor of confining significant work loads to a relatively
          small number of devices. Optional features or increased assurance
          that engenders more pervasive processing loads MAY be made available
          for deployments where the additional resources are economically
          justifiable.</t>

          <t>New authentication and security mechanisms should not rely on
          systems external to the routing system (the equipment that is
          performing forwarding) in order for the routing system to function.
          In order to ensure the rapid initialization and/or return to service
          of failed nodes it is important to reduce reliance on these external
          systems to the greatest extent possible. Proposed solutions SHOULD
          NOT require connections to external systems, beyond those directly
          involved in peering relationships, in order to return to full
          service. It is however acceptable for the proposed solutions to
          require post initialization synchronization with external systems in
          order to fully synchronize the security information.<vspace
          blankLines="1" />If authentication and security mechanisms rely on
          systems external to the routing system, then there MUST be one or
          more options available to avoid circular dependencies. For example,
          it is not acceptable to have the operation of OSPF within a routing
          domain depend upon correct operation of a security protocol, have
          correct operation of the security protocol depend upon the ability
          to exchange IP packets between remote systems, and have the ability
          to exchange IP packets between remote systems depend upon correct
          operation of the same instance of OSPF within the same routing
          domain. However, it is okay to have operation of multicast routing
          and/or inter-domain routing depend upon operation of a security
          protocol, which depends upon exchange of IP packets between remote
          systems, which depends upon the correct operation of OSPF for
          unicast routing. Similarly it would be okay to have the operation of
          OSPF depend upon a security protocol, which in turn uses an out of
          band network to exchange information with remote systems.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document is mostly about security considerations for the KARP
      efforts, both threats and requirements for addressing those threats.
      More detailed security considerations were placed in the Security
      Considerations section of the KARP Design Guide <xref target="RFC6518">
      </xref>document.</t>

     <t>Spoofing by a Legitimate Neighbor - In several routing protocols (e.g ) all speakers share the same key, a group key, on a broadcast segment. Possession of the group key itself is used for identity validation, and no other identity check is used. Under these conditions an attack exists where one neighbor (E.g. Router 1, or R1) can masquerade as a different neighbor, R2, by sending spoofed packets using R2 as the source IP address. When other neighbors, R3 and R4, receive these packets, they will calculate the MAC successfully, and process its contents as if it originated from R2. SPOOFING this way, the attacker can succeed in several different types of attacks, including FALSIFICATION and INTERFERENCE. The source of such an attack is a BYZANTINE actor, since the attack originates from a legitimate actor in the routing system, and such sources are out of scope for KARP. This type of attack has been well documented in the group keying problem space, and it's non-trivial to solve. The common method used to prevent this type of attack is to use a unique key for each sender rather than a group key. Other solutions exist within the group keying realm, but they come with significant increases in complexity and computational intensity. KARP protocol design teams should consider this attack and determine, based on costs and benefits, if a plausible solution can be employed, and document the decision, either way.</t>
