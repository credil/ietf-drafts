1.  Introduction

   PIM Join attributes as defined in [RFC5384] allow for specifying a
   set of attributes for each of the joined or pruned sources in a PIM
   Join/Prune message.  Attributes must be separately specified for each
   individual source in the message.  However, in some cases the same
   attributes and values need to be specified for some, or even all, the
   sources in the message.  The attributes and their values then need to
   be repeated for each of the sources where they apply.

   This document provides a hierarchical way of encoding attributes and
   their values in a Join/Prune message, so that if the same attribute
   and value is to apply for all the sources, it needs only be specified
   once in the message.  Similarly, if all the sources in a specific
   group set share a specific attribute and value, it needs only be
   specified once for the entire group set.

   This document updates [RFC5384] which defines an encoding to be used
   for Encoded-Source Addresses.  This document extends this by
   specifying the same encoding type also for Encoded-Unicast and
   Encoded-Group formats.  This document defines a new IANA registry for
   PIM encoding types which is to be used for all the fields in PIM
   messages where encoding types are used, replacing the old registry
   that is specific to Encoded-Source Addresses.  The encoding type used
   for Join attributes is however still limited to be used in Join/Prune
   messages.  Note that Join attributes, as they are referred to in
   [RFC5384], also apply to pruned sources in a Join/Prune message.
   Thus the more correct name Join/Prune attributes will be used
   throughout the rest of this document.

   This document allows Join/Prune attributes to be specified in the
   Upstream Neighbor Address field, and also in the Multicast Group
   Address field, of a Join/Prune message.  It defines how this is used
   to specify the same Join/Prune attribute and value for multiple

   sources.  This document also defines a new Join/Prune attribute to
   further control the scope of hierarchical attributes, as well as a
   new Hello Option to indicate support for the hierarchical encoding
   specified.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The message contains a single Upstream Neighbor Address, and one or
   more group sets.  Each group set contains a Group Address and two
   source lists, the Joined Sources and the Pruned Sources.  The
   Upstream Neighbor Address, the group addresses and the source
   addresses are all encoded in Encoded-Unicast format, Encoded-Group
   format and Encoded-Source format, respectively.  In this document we
   make use of this to allow Join/Prune attributes in each of these
   addresses, using the encoding in Section 5.

   For a Join/Prune message we define a hierarchy of Join/Prune
   attributes.  At the highest level, that is the least specific, we
   have attributes that apply to every source in the message.  These are
   encoded in the Upstream Neighbor Address.  At the next more specific
   level we have attributes that apply to every source in a group set.
   They are encoded in a Group Address.  And finally at the most
   specific level, we have attributes that just apply to a single
   source, encoded in the source address as defined in [RFC5384].

   The complete set of attributes that apply to a given source is
   obtained by combining the message wide attributes, the attributes of
   the group set that the source belongs to, and the source specific
   attributes.  However, if the same attribute is specified at multiple
   levels, then the one at the most specific level overrides the other
   instances of the attribute.

   Note that Join/Prune attributes are still applied to sources as
   specified in [RFC5384].  This document does not change the meaning of
   any attributes, it is simply a more compact way of encoding an
   attribute when the same attribute and value applies to multiple
   sources.

Internet-Draft     Hierarchical Join/Prune Attributes       October 2013


4.  Do Not Inherit (DNH) Join/Prune Attribute

   When considering the attributes for a specific source we inherit
   attributes from higher up in the hierarchy.  As described above, if
   an attribute is specified at multiple levels, the one at the most
   specific level overrides the other instances of the attribute.
   However, we also want to be able to ignore attributes rather than
   overriding them.  For instance if a given attribute and value should
   be specified for all sources but one, the attribute can be encoded in
   the Upstream Neighbor Address, but we need a way to specify that for
   the one source the attribute should not be applied.  We do this by
   defining a new attribute called Do Not Inherit (DNH) that lists
   attribute types that should not be inherited from the less specific
   levels of the hierarchy.  For the one source we add the DNH attribute
   specifying that the one attribute type should be ignored if present
   at the message wide or at the group level.  Similarly the DNH
   attribute can be used at the group level to ignore certain attributes
   specifed at the message wide level.  If an attribute is ignored at a
   level, it can again be specified where needed at more specific
   levels.

   Do Not Inherit Attribute Format

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...
   |F|S| Attr Type | Length        | Ignore Type 1 | Ignore Type 2 |...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...


   F-bit (transitive) MUST be set to 0.  This attribute MUST not be
   transitive.  A router receiving a message using hierarchical
   attributes would decide whether this attribute is needed for
   efficient encoding and where when formatting a Join/Prune to send
   upstream, and this is independent of how a received Join/Prune was
   formatted.

   E-bit (end of attributes) is set according to whether it is the last
   encoded attribute, see xref target="RFC5384"/>.

   Attr Type = TBD1 is the type identifying this attribute.

   Length denotes the length of the value field in octets.

   The value field of the attribute consists of a list of attributes to
   not inherit.  Each octet specifies one attribute type.

5.  PIM Address Encoding Types

   Addresses in PIM messages are specified together with an address
   family and an encoding type.  This applies to Encoded-Unicast,
   Encoded-Group and Encoded-Source addresses.  The encoding types allow
   the address to be encoded according to different schemes.  While it
   is possible to have the same encoding type value indicate different
   encodings depending on whether it is a Unicast, Group or Source
   address, it is simpler to have the same encoding type value indicate
   the same encoding independent of where it is used.  This means that
   as currently defined, 0 means a native encoding, and 1 means there
   are Join/Prune attributes, encoded according to [RFC5384].  Even if
   the encoding type space is shared between the different address types
   (Encoded-Unicast, Encoded-Group and Encoded-Source), one could have a
   specific encoding apply to a specific address type if needed.

   The current IANA PIM Encoded-Source Address Encoding Type Field
   registry should be changed into a PIM Address Encoding Type registry.

6.  Hierarchical Join/Prune Attribute Hello Option

   A PIM router indicates that it supports the mechanism specified in
   this document by including the Hierarchical Join/Prune Attribute
   Hello Option in its PIM Hello message.  Note that it also needs to
   include the Join-Attribute Hello option as specified in [RFC5384].
   The format of the Hierarchical Join/Prune Attribute Hello Option is
   defined to be:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |        OptionType = TBD2      |       OptionLength = 0        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   OptionType = TBD2, OptionLength = 0.  Note that there is no option
   value included.

   A PIM router MUST NOT send a Join/Prune message with Join/Prune
   attributes encoded in the Upstream Neighbor Address or any of the
   group addresses out any interface on which there is a PIM neighbor
   that has not included this option in its Hellos.  Even a router that
   is not the upstream neighbor must be able to parse the message in
   order to do Join suppression or Prune overriding.

7.  Security Considerations

Internet-Draft     Hierarchical Join/Prune Attributes       October 2013


   This document specifies a more compact encoding of Join/Prune
   attributes.  Use of the encoding has no impact on security.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The current PIM Encoded-Source Address Encoding Type Field registry
   should be changed into a PIM Address Encoding Type registry.  The
   only required change is the name of the registry.  The contents
   remain the same.

   An assignment is needed from the Join attribute registry for the Do
   Not Inherit attribute.  The string TBD1 needs to be replaced with the
   assigned value.

   A new PIM Hello Option type needs to be assigned.  The string TBD2
   needs to be replaced with the permanently assigned value.
