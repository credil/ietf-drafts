          Representing registration policy for IDNs using XML
                       draft-davies-idntables-00

Abstract

   This memo describes a method of representing the registration policy
   that a zone administrator uses for registering Internationalised
   Domain Names using Extensible Markup Language (XML).  These registry
   policies, commonly known as "IDN tables", are used to enforce and
   share policy on which specific code-points are permitted for
   registrations, and which alternative code-points are considered
   variants.

1.  Introduction

   This memo describes how to use Extensible Markup Language (XML) to
   describe the list of permissible code points and variants used in a
   zone administrator's policies.

   Historically, zone administrators - such as top-level domain
   registries - have published their policies using text and HTML based
   formats loosely based around the format used to describe a Language
   Variant Table in [RFC3743].  [RFC4290] further posts a "Model table
   format" that describes a similar set of functionality.

   Through the first decade of IDN deployment, experience has shown that
   these table formats are difficult to consistently implement and
   compare due to their different formats.  A more universal format,
   such as one using a structured XML format, will assist by improving
   machine-readability, consistency, and maintainability of IDN tables.
   It will also provide for more complex conditional implementation of
   variants that reflects the known requirements of current zone
   administrator policies.

2.  Design Goals

   The following items are explicit design goals of this format:

   o  MUST be in a format that can be implemented in a reasonably
      straightforward manner in software;

   o  The format SHOULD be able to be checked for formatting errors,
      such that common mistakes can be caught;

   o  An IDN Table MUST be able to express the set of valid code points
      that are allowed for registration under a specific zone
      administrator's policies;

   o  MUST be able to express computed alternatives to a given domain
      name based on a one-to-one, or one-to-many relationship.  These
      computed alternatives are commonly known as "IDN variants";

   o  IDN Variants SHOULD be able to be tagged with specific categories,
      such that the categories can be used to support registry policy
      (such as whether to list the computed variant in the zone, or to
      merely block it from registration);

   o  IDN Variants MUST be able to stipulated based on contextual
      information.  For example, specific variants may only be
      applicable when they follow another specific code point, or when
      the code point is displayed in a specific presentation form;

   o  The data contained within the table MUST be unambiguous, such that
      independent implementations that utilise the contents will arrive
      at the same results;

   o  IDN Tables SHOULD be suitable for comparison and re-use, such that
      one could easily compare the contents of two or more to see the
      differences, to merge them, and so on.

   o  As many existing IDN Tables are practicable SHOULD be able to be
      migrated to the new format with all applicable logic retained.

   It is explicitly NOT the goal of this format to:

   o  Stipulate what code points should be listed in an IDN Table by a
      zone administrator.  What registration policies are used for a
      particular zone is outside the scope of this memo.

   o  Stipulate what a consumer of an IDN Table must do when they
      determine a particular domain is valid or invalid; or arrive at a
      set of computed IDN variants.  IDN Tables are only used to

      describe rules for computing code points, but does not prescribe
      how registries and other parties utilise them.

3.  IDN Table XML Format

3.1.  Basic structure

   The basic XML framework of the document is as follows:

       <?xml version="1.0"?>
       <idntable>
           ...
       </idntable>

   Within the "idntable" element rests two sub-elements.  Firstly is a
   "meta" element that contains all meta-data associated with the IDN
   table, such as its authorship, what it is used for, implementation
   notes and references.  This is followed by a "data" element that
   contains the substantive code-point data.

       <?xml version="1.0"?>
       <idntable>
           <meta>
               ...
           </meta>
           <data>
               ...
           </data>
       </idntable>

   A document should contain exactly one "idntable" element, and within
   that optionally one "meta" element and exactly one "data" element.

3.2.  The meta element

   The "meta" element is used to express meta-data associated within the
   IDN table.  It can be used to explain the author or relevant contact
   person, explain what the usage of the IDN table is, provide
   implementation notes as well as references.  The data contained
   within is not required by software consuming the IDN table in order
   to calculate valid IDN labels, or to calculate variants.

3.2.1.  The version element

   The "version" element is used to uniquely identify each version of
   the table being represented.  No specific format is required, but it
   is RECOMMENDED that it be a numerical positive integer, which is
   incremented with each revision of the file.

   An example of a typical first edition of a document:




Davies                  Expires September 1, 2012               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        IDN Table XML representation         February 2012


       <version>1</version>

   A common alternative is to use a major-minor number scheme, where two
   decimal numbers are used to represent major and minor changes to the
   table.  For example, "1.0" would be the first major release, "1.1"
   would be a minor update to that, and "2.0" would represent a major
   revision.

3.2.2.  The date element

   The "date" element is used to identify the date the table was
   written.  The contents of this element MUST be a valid ISO 8601 date
   string as described in [RFC3339].

   Example of a date:

       <date>2009-11-01</date>

3.2.3.  The language element

   The "language" element signals that the table is associated with a
   specific language or script.  The value of the language element must
   be a valid language tag as described in [RFC5646].  The tag may
   simply refer to a script if the table is not referring to a specific
   language.  There may be multiple language elements for a table if the
   table spans multiple languages and/or scripts.

   Example of an English language table:

      <language>en</language>

   If the table applies to a specific script, rather than a language,
   the "und" language tag should be used followed by the relevant
   [RFC5646] script subtag.  For example, for a Cyrillic script table:

      <language>und-Cyrl</language>

3.2.4.  The domain element

   This optional element refers to a domain to which this policy is
   applied.

       <domain>example</domain>

   There may be multiple <domain> tags used to reflect a list of
   domains.

Internet-Draft        IDN Table XML representation         February 2012


3.2.5.  The description element

   The "description" element is a free-form element that contains any
   additional relevant description.  Typically, this field contains
   authorship information, as well as additional context on how the
   table was formulated (such as with references), and how it has been
   applied.

   The element has an optional "type" attribute, which refers to the
   MIME-type of the enclosed data.  If the description lacks a type
   field, it will be assumed to be plain text.

   The description elements describe information relating to the IDN
   table that is useful for the user of the table in its interpretation.
   This may explain the history, the rationale, reference sources etc.
   It may also contain authorship information.

   The "type" attribute may be used to specify the encoding within
   description element.  The attribute should be a valid MIME type.  If
   supplied, it will be assumed the contents is a single CDATA element
   of that encoding.  Typical types would be "text/plain" or "text/
   html". "text/plain" will be assumed if no type attribute is
   specified.

3.2.6.  The variant-classes element

   Consumers of the IDN table may classify the generated variants into
   different classes using the class attribute, discussed below.  This
   class attribute allows the registry to apply different policy (for
   example, whether the block or register specific generated strings).
   The variant-classes block provides human-readable explanations of the
   meaning of the classes used in the IDN table.

3.3.  The data element

   The "data" element contains the code point data the comprises the
   registry policy.  It describes registry policy using a series of XML
   elements that either represent individual code points, or ranges of
   code points.

   The data may use the "char" and "range" elements to specify code
   points, and code ranges.

   Discrete permissable code points may be stipulated with a "char"
   element, e.g.

       <char cp="002D"/>

Internet-Draft        IDN Table XML representation         February 2012


   Ranges of permissable code points may be stipulated with a "range"
   element, e.g.

       <range first-cp="0030" last-cp="0039"/>

   Codepoints must be expressed in hexadecimal, i.e. according to the
   standard Unicode convention without the prefix "U+".  The rationale
   for not allowing other encoding formats, including native Unicode
   encoding in XML, is explored in [UAX42].  The XML conventions used in
   this format, including the element and attribute names, mirror this
   document where practical and reasonable to do so.

3.3.1.  Variants

   While most tables typically only determine code point eligibility,
   others additionally specify a mapping of code points to other code
   points, known as "variants".  What constitutes a variant is a matter
   of policy, and varies for each implementation.

3.3.1.1.  Basic variants

   Variants are specified as one of more children of a "char" element.

   For example, to map "v" as a variant of "u":

   <char cp="0075">
     <var cp="0076"/>
   </char>

   A sequence of multiple code points can be specified as a variant of a
   single code point.  For example, the sequence of "o" then "e" can be
   specified as a variant for an "o with umlaut" (U+00F6) as follows:

   <char cp="00F6">
     <var cp="006F 0065"/>
   </char>

   It is not possible to specify variants for ranges.

3.3.1.2.  Null variants

   To specify a null variant, which is a variant string that maps to no
   codepoint, use the null codepoint 0000.  For example, to mark a
   string with a zero width non-joiner to the same string without the
   zero width non-joiner:

   <char cp="200c">
     <var cp="0000"/>

Internet-Draft        IDN Table XML representation         February 2012


   </char>

3.3.1.3.  Conditional variants

   At its basis, generation of variants are conditional on a specific
   code point or set of code points.  However, in some instances
   registries perform control based on other attributes that can not
   solely be determined based on simple code point comparisons.  For
   example, in some tables utilising the Arabic script, the Arabic
   contextual form is a determinant in which variants are used.  The
   contextual form can not be derived solely from the code point, as the
   code point is the same for the various forms.

   The IDN table provides for conditioning generation variants on
   specific instances as follows, using the "when" attribute.

   arabic-initial  Based on context, the code point would be presented
        in its Arabic Initial form.

   arabic-isolated  Based on context, the code point would be presented
        in its Arabic Isolated form.

   arabic-medial  Based on context, the code point would be presented in
        its Arabic Medial form.

   arabic-final  Based on context, the code point would be presented in
        its Arabic Final form.

   For example, to mark U+0673 as a variant of U+0625, but only when it
   appears in isolated or final forms:

   <char cp="0625">
     <var cp="0673" when="arabic-isolated"/>
     <var cp="0673" when="arabic-final"/>
   </char>

4.  Processing a label against a table

4.1.  Determining eligibility for a label

   In order to use a table to test a specific IDN table for membership
   in the table, a consumer of an IDN table must iterate through each
   code point within a given U-label, and test that each code point is a
   member of the IDN table.  If any code point is not a member of the
   IDN Table, it shall be deemed as not eligible in accordance with the
   table.

   A code point is deemed a member of the table when it is listed with
   the <char> element, and all necessary condition listed in "when"
   attributes are correctly satisfied.

4.2.  Determining variants for a label

   For a given eligible label, the set of variants is deemed to be each
   possible permutation of <var> elements, whereby all "when" attributes
   are correctly satisfied for each code point in the given permutation.

5.  Conversion between other formats

5.1.  RFC 3743 Language Variant Table

   All attributes can be retained in conversion from an [RFC3743]
   language variant table to this XML format.

   This XML format can be converted to the format described in
   [RFC3743], with the following caveats:

   o  Version numbers not expressed as integers will not satisfy the
      ABNF formatting for [RFC3743].

   o  Much of the additional meta data can not be expressed in the text
      format (although can be supplied as comments in the text file).

   o  The [RFC3743] format only allows for two variant classes, those
      that are preferred and those that are regular.  Other distinctions
      will be lost.

   o  No ability to retain conditional variants.

5.2.  RFC 4290 Model Table Format

   All attributes can be retained in conversion from the [RFC4290] model
   table format to this XML format.

   Tables similarly can be converted to the format described in
   [RFC4290] with the same caveats as the [RFC3743] format, and
   additionally the inability to classify variants into groups such as
   "preferred".

Appendix B.  Acknowledgements

   This format builds upon the work on documenting IDN tables by a
   number of other parties, most significantly that of the the Joint
   Engineering Team published as [RFC3743], and [RFC5564] published by
   the Arabic-language community.

   Contributions that have helped shape this document have been
   contributed by Francisco Arias, Nicholas Ostler, Steve Sheng and
   Andrew Sullivan.

Appendix C.  Editorial Notes

   This appendix to be removed prior to final publication.

C.1.  Known Issues and Future Work

   o  The text does not currently provide a mechanism for deriving
      variants based on a sequence of two or more code points.  Such a
      mechanism would be required to perform an inverse mapping from one
      provided in this document, namely, mapping the sequence of "o" and
      "e" to an "o with umlaut"

   o  A mechanism for a specific code point only being eligible when
      preceded or followed by a specific sequence of characters is not
      provided.  Such a mechanism is needed to support the contextual
      rule required by the .CAT top-level domain, which supports the
      middle dot (U+00B7) only when both preceded and followed by the
      letter "l" (U+006C).

   o  An optional mechanism for explicitly nominating the registry
      action associated with a computed variant could be added.  For
      example, an "action" attribute to the <var> element could specify
      one of the following: "allocate", "block", "delegate", "mirror" or
      "withhold".  Each of these actions would need to be formally
      defined.

   o  The tables may benefit from a unique identifier, such as an "id"
      attribute on the <idntables> element.

   o  A more formal step-wise description of how variants are computed
      needs to be supplied.

C.2.  Sample tables and running code

   Some sample tables using this format, as well as a basic
   implementation of this specification, is posted at
   https://github.com/kjd/idntables

C.3.  Change History
