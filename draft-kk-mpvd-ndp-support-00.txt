Internet-Draft               NDP PVD support                October 2013


1.  Introduction

   The MIF working group is producing a solution to solve the issues
   that are associated with nodes that can be attached to multiple
   networks based on the Multiple Provisioning Domains (MPVD)
   architecture work [I-D.anipko-mif-mpvd-arch].  One part of the
   solution requires associating configuration information with
   Provisioning Domains (PVD).  This document describes an IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery Protocol (NDP) [RFC4861] mechanism for explicitly
   indicating provisioning domain information along with any
   configuration that will be provided.  The proposed mechanism uses an
   NDP option that indicates the identity of the provisioning domain and
   encapsulates the options that contain the configuration information
   as well as any accompanying authentication/authorization information.
   The solution defined in this document aligns as much as possible with
   the existing IPv6 Neighbor Discovery security, namely with Secure
   Neighbor Discovery (SeND) [RFC3971].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  PVD Container option

   The PVD container option (PVD_CO) is used to encapsulate and group
   together all the configuration options that belong to the explicitly
   identified provisioning domain.  The PVD container option MUST
   encapsulate exactly one PVD identifier option (PVD_ID).  The PVD
   container option MAY occur multiple times in the same NDP message but
   each of these PVD container options MUST have a different PVD
   identity specified under its PVD identity option.  A PVD container is
   intended to be used in IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) NDP messages.
   However, including a PVD container inside a Router Solicitation (RS)
   NDP messages is also possible (actually, a host can in this way
   solicit for information from a specific PVD).

   For the backward compatibility and the reuse of existing NDP options,
   the PVD container can encapsulate any (meaningful) existing IPv6 NDP
   options.  For example, the PVD container could encapsulate a Prefix
   Information Option (PIO), which would mark that a certain advertised
   IPv6 prefix belongs and originates from a specific PVD.  Furthermore,
   for the backward compatibility reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that
   options critical for establishing IP communication (such as the
   prefix and DNS information) are encapsulated inside the PVD container

   as well as in the RA (although this will cause duplication of
   information is most cases).  This ensures hosts that do not
   understand provisioning domain concept, will at least receive the
   implicit provisioning domain configuration.  Hosts that understand
   provisioning domain SHOULD always give configuration information
   encapsulated inside the PVD container a higher priority than the ones
   outside the PVD container(s).  It should be noted that a router can
   do smart advertisement of "legacy" configuration information and the
   PVD container encapsulated.  The router MAY leave some of the
   provisioning domain specific information outside the "legacy
   [RFC4861] way" of advertising them in RAs.

   The optional security for the PVD container is based on X.509
   certificates [RFC6487] and reuses mechanisms already defined for SeND
   [RFC3971] [RFC6495].  However, the use of PVD containers does not
   assume or depend on SeND being deployed or even implemented.  The PVD
   containers SHOULD be signed per PVD certificates, which provides both
   integrity protection and proves that the configuration information
   source is authorized for advertising the given information.

   Length

       Length of the PVD_CO.  The actual length depends on the number of
       suboptions and the optional Key Hash/Digital Signature/Padding.

   Options Count

       The number of suboptions in this PVD container.  MUST be 1 or
       greater.

   Name Type

       Names the algorithm used to identify a specific X.509 certificate
       using the method defined for the Subject Key Identifier (SKI)
       extension for the X.509 certificates.  The usage and the Name
       Type registry aligns with the mechanism defined for SeND
       [RFC6494][RFC6495].  Name Type values starting from 3 are
       supported and an implementation MUST at least support SHA-1
       (value 3).

   Suboptions

       One or more suboptions that describe properties and other meta
       data attached to the provisioning domain.  See Section 4 for
       description of the PVD_ID suboption.  All suboptions MUST be
       multiple of 8 octets and provide required padding with '\0'
       octets, when needed.  Unknown suboptions MUST be silently
       discarded.

   Key Hash

       A hash of the public key using the algorithm identified by the
       Name Type.  The procedure how the Key Hash is calculated is
       defined in [RFC3971] and [RFC6495].

   Digital Signature

       A signature calculated over the PVD_CO option including all
       option data from the beginning of the option until the Key Hash
       field.  The procedure of calculating the signature is identical
       to the one defined for SeND [RFC3971].

   Padding

       Zero or more '\0' octets to make the PVD_CO to multiple of 8
       octets.

   The presence of the optional Key Hash and Digital Signature field is

   determined from the Length field, i.e. the option length is greater
   than 0 after subtracting 'Options Count' times suboptions from it,
   then the signature part of the option is present.  If the PVD_CO does
   not contain a digital signature, then other means to secure the
   integrity of the NDP message SHOULD be provided, such as utilizing
   SeND.  However, the security provided by SeND is for the entire NDP
   message and does not allow verifying whether the sender of the NDP
   message is actually authorized for the information for the
   provisioning domain.

   If the PVD_CO contains a signature and the verification fails, then
   the whole PVD_CO MUST be silently discarded and the event SHOULD be
   logged.


4.  PVD Identity option

   The PVD identity option (PVD_ID) is used to explicitly indicate the
   identity of the provisioning domain that is associated with the
   configuration information encapsulated by the PVD container option.
   A PVD container MUST have exactly one PVD identity option.

   Length

       Length of the PVD_ID.

   ID-Type

       Describes the type of identification information.  This document
       defines four types of PVD identity information:

           0x01: UUID [RFC4122]
           0x02: UTF-8 string
           0x03: OID [OID]
           0x03: NAI Realm [RFC4282]

   ID-Length

       Length of the Provisioning Domain Identifier in octets.

   Provisioning Domain Identifier

       The PVD identification that is based on the id-type.  The
       identifier MUST be '\0' octet padded until the PVD_ID option
       length is multiple of 8 octet.

   If the receiver of the PVD_ID option does not understand any of the
   ID-Types, then the whole encapsulating PVD_CO MUST be silently
   discarded.


5.  Set of allowable options

   The PVD container option MAY be used to encapsulate any allocated
   IPv6 NDP options but MUST NOT be used to encapsulate another PVD_CO
   option.  [TODO: Should we add any other exclusions?].


6.  Security Considerations

   An attacker may attempt to modify the information provided inside the
   PVD container option.  These attacks can easily be prevented by using
   SeND [RFC3971] or per PVD container signature that would detect any
   form of tampering with the IPv6 NDP message contents.

   A compromised router may advertise configuration information related
   to PvDs it is not authorized to advertise. e.g.  A coffee shop router
   may provide configuration information purporting to be from an
   enterprise and may try to attract enterprise related traffic.  The
   only real way to avoid this is that the PvD container contains
   embedded authentication and authorization information from the owner
   of the PvD.  Then, this attack can be detected by the client by
   verifying the authentication and authorization information provided
   inside the PVD container option after verifying its trust towards the
   PvD owner (e.g. a certificate with a well-known/common trust anchor).

   A compromised configuration source or an on-link attacker may try to
   capture advertised configuration information and replay it on a
   different link or at a future point in time.  This can be avoided by

   including some replay protection mechanism such as a timestamp or a
   nonce inside the PvD container to ensure freshness of the provided
   information.
