This document contains an SLP service type template that
describes the advertisements made by RSIP servers for their services.
Service Location Protocol (SLP) is an IETF standards track protocol
specifically designed to allow clients to find servers offering
particular services.  Since RSIP (Realm Specific IP) clients require a
mechanism to discover RSIP servers, SLP is a natural match for a
solution.  The service type template is the basis for an Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) standard definition of the
advertisements offered by RSIP servers, an important step toward
interoperability.

This document is a product of the Network Address Translator Working
Group of the IETF.
