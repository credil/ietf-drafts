                 LISP Based FlowMapping for Scaling NFV
                        draft-barkai-lisp-nfv-00

Abstract

   This draft describes distributed flow-mapping applied according to
   RFC 6830 Locator ID Separation Protocol (LISP) for dynamic scaling of
   virtualized network functions (NFV) . Network functions such as
   subscriber management-mobility-security-quality, are typically
   delivered using proprietary appliances topologically embedded into
   the network as service-nodes or service-blades.  Next generation
   virtualized network functions are pure software instances running on
   standard servers - unbundled building blocks of processing capacity
   and modular functionality.  LISP based flow-mapping dynamically wires
   VNF instances into the data-path, and scales virtualized functions by
   steering the right traffic in the right sequence to the right
   process.

1.  Introduction

   This draft describes distributed flow-mapping applied according to
   RFC 6830 Locator ID Separation Protocol (LISP) for dynamic scaling of
   virtualized network functions (NFV) .[RFC6830]Network functions such
   as subscriber management-mobility-security-quality are typically
   delivered using proprietary appliances topologically embedded into
   the network as service-nodes or service-blades.

   This monolithic service delivery method increases the complexity of
   roll-out and capacity planning, limits functional choices, and
   inhibits service innovation.  Next generation virtualized network

   functions are pure software instances running on standard servers -
   unbundled building blocks of compute capacity and modular
   functionality.  This component based model opens up service provider
   networks to the savings of elasticity and the innovation of an open
   architectures.  However this model also presents the network (or the
   virtual network rather) with the brand new challenges of assembling
   components into whole solutions by forwarding the right traffic to
   the right process at the right sequence and the right time.

   While it is possible, to some extent, to use traditional virtual
   networking mechanisms such as virtual-LANs (VLAN) and virtual-
   private-networks (VPN) in-order to map traffic to functions-
   processes, these mechanisms are relatively static and require complex
   and intense configuration of physical network interfaces with vbridge
   vrf configuration.  NGN software-defined flow based models on the
   other hand are much more programmable and dynamic, and if
   orchestrated properly offer a better fit to next generation service-
   provider data-centers.  LISP based flow-mapping enables such a
   dynamic global orchestration of flows.  LISP xTRs wire virtual
   function instances into the data-path, based on dynamic identity-
   function and identity-location mappings, perform these actions in a
   dynamically programmable and elastic manner, and operate based on
   subscriber-profiles and function-demand global information.

2.  Connectivity Models Used

   The basic connectivity model used to map flows to function is an
   identity-matrix forwarding.  Unlike topological forwarding models
   which are based on source-subnet >> routed hop by hop >> to
   destination-subnet, identity-matrices are based on flow-identity
   "patched" to function-identity.  This model is implemented using the
   LISP distributed overlay and LISP distributed database mechanisms.
   These mechanisms are applied over in-place physical networks in a
   manner described bellow:

   o  The topological network basis or the "location" network is assumed
      to be implemented using standard bridging and routing.  Basic
      design principles are applied in order to achieve both physical
      capacity and physical availability of connectivity.  Typical
      examples of these practices include spine-leafs switching for
      cluster many server racks that are used as the compute and virtual
      compute foundations to functions.  These practices also include
      core-edge routing for inter-connecting server clusters across
      points of presence, as well as for inter-connecting these points
      of presence to the access networks and to the public Internet.

   o  The functional network or the "identity" matrix is there to map
      identified subscriber-flows carrying an application thread to the

      right function task or instance.  This identity-matrix enables
      scaling and massive concurrency of the logical compute functions.
      By mapping each subscriber-application flow to the correct
      processes based on global definitions of the service and
      application, the system can engage as many functional components
      as there are available within and across data canters.  Applied
      recursively flow-function matrix mapping can chain as many
      distinct functional components that make up a service as defined
      globally by the operator.

   o  The overlay network or the location-identity fabric enables the
      implementation of the functional network on the physical in-place
      bridge-routed network.  The overlay forms a virtualization ring
      around the core-spine physical networks.  All subscriber flows and
      function flows are aggregated at the outer interfaces of this
      virtualization ring, and are encapsulated over the inner
      interfaces of this ring in order to reach each of the locations.
      Ingress-Aggregation, Flow-Seperation, Matrix-Mapping,
      Encapsulation-Decapsulation, Egress-Delivry are all based on LISP
      xTRs and LISP mmap architecture and services.

3.  XTR FlowMapping Reference Architecture

   In order to map subscriber flows to virtualized function instances
   and essentially to overlay identity grid onto topology based bridge-
   routed network we use the following XTR 3-tier reference
   architecture:

   1.  Flow-Switching: is a set of n-tuple LOCALLY defined masks, BEST
       matched against each packet in-order to separate traffic to
       LOCALLY significant sequences representing application threads.
       Flows are either Encapsulated in-to the overlay, Decapsulated
       out-of the overlay, Forwarded up-to xTR internally registered
       Flow-Handlers ..

   2.  Flow-Handlers: are a set of control processes invoked for each
       flow where a specific identity-location mapping has not been
       defined and provisioned into the Flow-Switching.  The default
       "catch-all" Flow-Handler maps IP flows to locations and gateways
       based on RFC 6830.  In addition protocol-specific handlers can be
       loaded into the xTR for dealing with specific mapping and
       AFFINITY requirements of network functions such as SIP, GTP, S1X
       etc.

   3.  Global-Mappers: is how GLOBALLY significant key-value mappings is
       translated by Flow-Handlers to LOCALLY defines masks and
       encapsulation headers.  Examples of such mappings include
       functional VIP to actual function processes EIDs, application
       specific SubscriberIDs to function EIDs, public IP-Port to
       SubscriberID, and EIDs to RLOCs.
