                         RSVP Setup Protection
                draft-shen-mpls-rsvp-setup-protection-03

Abstract

   RFC 4090 specifies an RSVP facility-backup fast reroute mechanism for
   protecting LSPs against link and node failures.  This document
   extends the mechanism to provide so-called "setup protection" for
   LSPs during their initial Path message signaling time.  In
   particular, it enables a router to reroute an LSP via an existing
   bypass LSP, when there is a failure of the immediate downstream link
   or node along the desired path.  Therefore, it can be used to avoid
   LSP signaling failure and reduce setup time in such kind of
   situation, and allow an LSP to be established temporarily over a
   bypass LSP when an alternative path can only be resolved at a much
   later time.

1.  Introduction

   In RSVP facility-backup fast reroute (FRR) [RFC 4090], the router at
   a point of local repair (PLR) of an LSP can redirect traffic via a
   bypass LSP upon a failure of the immediate downstream link or node.
   Such protection is normally established after the LSP has been set
   up.  This is because the PLR must know the label and address of the
   next-hop router (in link protection) or those of the next-next-hop
   router (in node protection), before it can select or create a bypass
   LSP to protect the LSP.  The information of the label and the address
   is carried in the Resv message of the LSP.

Internet-Draft            RSVP Setup Protection                June 2013


   Imagine a scenario where a new LSP is being signaled, and its Path
   message carries an EXPLICIT_ROUTE object (ERO) with a strict path
   that is statically configured or computed offline based on a topology
   that assumes no failure of the network.  If a link or node along the
   path happens to be in a failure condition, RSVP signaling will stop
   at the router upstream adjacent to the failure, as the next hop in
   the strict path no longer matches the current network topology.  This
   will be the case even if there is an existing bypass LSP protecting
   the link or node for some existing LSPs.  In other words, this new
   LSP is not protected during the setup time, i.e. the initial Path
   message signaling.

   In this situation, the network would normally rely on IGP to update
   traffic engineering (TE) information throughout the network, and the
   router upstream adjacent to the failure to send a PathErr message to
   trigger the ingress router to compute and signal a new path.
   However, this approach may not always be possible or desirable in the
   following scenarios:

   1.  Static strict path.  As described above, if the ERO carries an
       explicit path with a sequence of strict hops that are statically
       configured or computed offline based on a topology assuming no
       network failure, the LSP will not be established until the path
       is modified.  This is a typical case where CSPF calculation is
       disabled at the LSP's ingress router due to the operational
       preference of service provider.

   2.  LSPs with a strict requirement for setup time.  IGP TE
       information flooding, PathErr message propagation and path re-
       computation and re-signaling may introduce a significant delay to
       LSP establishment.  This may impact on LSP setup time, and even
       become unacceptable for LSPs that have a strict requirement for
       it, such as on-demand transport LSPs for real-time data or TV
       broadcast.  For these LSPs, a guaranteed establishment and setup
       time are considered as more important than path optimality.

   3.  Sibling P2MP sub-LSPs sharing a common link.  In this case, the
       new LSP is a sub-LSP of a P2MP LSP, and its desired path is
       supposed to share the failed link with an existing sibling sub-
       LSP, i.e. another sub-LSP of the same P2MP LSP, which is being
       protected by a bypass LSP.  If the new sub-LSP is rerouted via a
       different path, it will not be able to share the data flow over
       the bypass LSP with that sibling sub-LSP, creating unnecessary
       traffic flow in the network.

   For networks where a failure, delay or resignaling during LSP setup
   is not desirable, this document extends the RSVP facility-backup fast
   reroute mechanism to provide a graceful solution, called "setup

   protection".  During the initial Path message signaling of an LSP, if
   there is a link or node failure along the desired path, and if there
   is a bypass LSP protecting the link or node, the LSP can be signaled
   through the bypass LSP without a delay.  The LSP will be established
   as if it were originally set up along the desired path (i.e. primary
   path) and then failed over to the bypass LSP after the failure.
   Meanwhile, actions may be taken to resolve the failure or resignal
   the LSP via an alternative path, by following procedures or timing
   appropriate to the service provider.  The setup protection is
   applicable to both P2P LSPs and P2MP LSPs, when such kind of
   temporary rerouting is not considered as a violation of desired path,
   as in the case of the normal fast reroute.  It may be enabled by
   policy on a per LSP basis.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3.  Theory of Operation

   When an LSP is being signaled by RSVP, a Path message is sent hop by
   hop from the ingress router to the egress router, following the path
   defined by an ERO.  The setup protection mechanism in this document
   enables a router to reroute the LSP via a bypass LSP, if the router
   detects a failure of the immediate downstream link or node
   represented by the next hop in the ERO, called "next ERO hop".  In
   this case, the current router is referred to as a PLR.

   The mechanism is only relevant when the Path message carries the
   "local protection desired" flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object [RFC
   4090] and a new "setup protection desired" flag defined in this
   document (Section 3.1).  That is, setup protection is explicitly
   requested for the LSP.

   In link protection, the mechanism is only applicable when the next
   ERO hop received by a PLR is a strict hop.  In node protection, the
   mechanism is only applicable when both the next and the next-next ERO
   hops received by the PLR are strict hops.  Otherwise, setup
   protection would be unnecessary, as the router may perform a loose
   hop expansion to reroute the LSP via any alternative path around the
   downstream failure.  The strict ERO hops ensure that the PLR can
   unambiguously decide the intended downstream link or node and
   reliably detect its status.  In link protection, the strict next ERO
   hop also indicates the merge point (MP), i.e. the destination of the
   bypass LSP to be used to reroute the LSP.  In node protection, the
   strict next-next ERO hop indicates the MP.

Internet-Draft            RSVP Setup Protection                June 2013


   When performing setup protection, the PLR signals a backup LSP by
   tunneling Path message through the bypass LSP.  Like the Path message
   of a backup LSP in the normal facility-backup FRR ([RFC 4090]), this
   Path message carries an address of the PLR as the sender address in
   SENDER_TEMPLATE object.  In addition, the Path message also carries
   the information of the protected LSP (Section 3.2).  When the MP
   receives the Path message, it terminates the backup LSP, and re-
   creates the protected LSP.  If the MP is the egress router of the
   protected LSP, it terminates the protected LSP as well.  If the MP is
   a transit router of the protected LSP, it signals the LSP further
   downstream.

   Eventually, the LSP will be established end to end, with the backup
   LSP tunneled through the bypass LSP from the PLR to the MP.  The RSVP
   state on the PLR and the MP and the RSVP messages generated by these
   routers are no different than those in a post-failure situation of a
   normal facility-backup FRR.

   Later, when the failure is resolved, the PLR MAY revert the LSP to
   the primary path, in the same manner as the local revertive mode
   specified in [RFC 4090].

   The setup protection MAY be enabled and disabled on a router based on
   configuration.  For an LSP to be setup-protected, the mode MUST be
   enabled on both PLR and MP.  If it is enabled on the PLR but disabled
   on the MP, the MP SHOULD reject the Path message of the backup LSP
   and send a PathErr message, as described Section 3.4.

3.1.  New RSVP Attribute Flag

   In order for an LSP to explicitly request setup protection, this
   document defines a new "setup protection desired" flag for the
   Attribute Flags TLV of the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object [RFC5420].  The flag
   is set by the ingress router in the Path message of the LSP, i.e. the
   protected LSP.  It MUST be supported by all routers that intend to
   serve as PLRs for setup protection.

3.2.  New RSVP Attributes TLVs

   This document defines the following two new RSVP Attributes TLVs [RFC
   5420].  They are used by a PLR to convey to an MP the original sender
   address in SENDER_TEMPLATE object of the Path message of a protected
   LSP.

   o  Protected LSP Sender IPv4 Address TLV

   o  Protected LSP Sender IPv6 Address TLV

   One of the TLVs SHOULD be carried by the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES
   object of the Path message of the backup LSP that the PLR sends to
   the MP.  The information is used by the MP to build Path message for
   the protected LSP.  The MP SHOULD NOT propagate the TLV downstream
   via that Path message.

   The Protected LSP Sender IPv4 Address TLV is defined with type TBD.
   It is allowed in LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object, and not allowed in

      Original sender address in the IPv6 SENDER_TEMPLATE object of the
      protected LSP.

3.3.  PLR behavior

   When a router has a Path message to send out, if the Path message
   carries the "local protection desired" flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE
   object and the "setup protection desired" flag in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES
   object, and if the next ERO hop is a strict IPv4 or IPv6 prefix, the
   router SHOULD validate the reachability of the prefix against routing
   tables, traffic engineering (TE) database, or a database that
   reflects the current status of the network topology.  If the prefix
   is reachable and is one hop away from the current router, the router
   should send out the Path message as it is.  Otherwise, there is a
   possibility that the link or node corresponding to the prefix has
   failed.

   The router SHOULD further search for an existing bypass LSP that is
   protecting the prefix.  If the protected LSP desires link protection,
   the destination of the bypass LSP (i.e. MP) must be the router that
   owns the prefix.  If the LSP desires node protection and the next-
   next ERO hop of the LSP is a strict prefix, the MP must be the router
   that owns this prefix.

   If a bypass LSP is not found by the above criteria, the router MUST
   originate a PathErr with code = 24 (routing problem) and sub-code = 2
   (bad strict node).

   If a bypass LSP is found, the router MUST act as a PLR for setup
   protection, and reroute the protected LSP via the bypass LSP.  If
   multiple satisfactory bypass LSPs exist, the PLR MAY select one based
   on bandwidth constraints or local policies.  Specifically, if the
   protected LSP is a sub-LSP of a P2MP LSP, a bypass LSP that is



Shen, et al.            Expires December 30, 2013               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            RSVP Setup Protection                June 2013


   protecting an existing sibling sub-LSP MUST be preferred, to minimize
   traffic duplication in the network.

   The PLR SHOULD NOT send the Path message of the protected LSP any
   further.  Instead, it MUST create a backup LSP, and send a Path
   message of the backup LSP to the MP via the bypass LSP.  The Path
   message is constructed by using the sender template specific method
   [RFC 4090].  In particular, it has the sender address in the
   SENDER_TEMPLATE object set to an address of the PLR.  It MUST carry
   an LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object with a Protected LSP Sender IPv4
   Address TLV or Protected LSP Sender IPv6 Address TLV.

   Upon receiving a Resv message of the backup LSP from the MP, the PLR
   SHOULD bring up both of the backup LSP and the protected LSP.  If the
   PLR is the ingress router of the protected LSP, the LSP has been set
   up successfully.  If the PLR is a transit router, it MUST send a Resv
   message upstream for the protected LSP, with the "local protection
   available" and "local protection in use" set to 1, and if applicable,
   the "node protection" and "bandwidth protection" flags set to 1, in
   the RRO hop corresponding to the PLR.  The PLR SHOULD also originate
   a PathErr message with code = 25 (notify error) and sub-code = 3
   (tunnel locally repaired), as if the LSP had just fell over to the
   bypass LSP.

   The PLR SHOULD also install a forwarding entry for the protected LSP.
   In the typical case, the forwarding entry should result in two
   outgoing labels for packets.  The inner label is the backup LSP's
   label, and the outer label is the bypass LSP's label.  However, the
   forwarding entry may result in one or no label, if either or both of
   the backup LSP and the bypass LSP have the Implicit NULL label.

   If the PLR receives a PathErr message when signaling the backup LSP,
   the PLR MUST NOT bring up the backup LSP or the protected LSP.  If
   the PLR is a transit router of the protected LSP, it MUST propagate
   the PathErr message upstream for the protected LSP.  Likewise, if the
   PLR receives a PathErr message of the backup LSP after the backup LSP
   and the primary LSP have previously been brought up, and the PLR is a
   transit router of the protected LSP, it SHOULD also propagate the
   PathErr message upstream for the protected LSP.

   When the PLR receives a ResvTear message of the backup LSP, the PLR
   MUST bring down both the backup LSP and the protected LSP.  If the
   PLR is a transit router of the protected LSP, it MUST send a ResvTear
   message upstream for the protected LSP.

   In any cases where the PLR needs to bring down the protected LSP due
   to a received PathTear message, an RSVP state time-out, a
   configuration change, an administrative command, etc, the PLR MUST

Internet-Draft            RSVP Setup Protection                June 2013


   also bring down the backup LSP by sending a PathTear message through
   the bypass LSP.

3.4.  MP behavior

   When an MP receives the Path message of a backup LSP, it MUST realize
   the setup protection situation based on the presence of Protected LSP
   Sender IPv4 Address TLV or Protected LSP Sender IPv6 Address TLV in
   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object.

   If setup protection mode is disabled on the MP, it MUST reject the
   Path message, by sending a PathErr with code = 2 (policy control
   failure) to the PLR.

   Otherwise, the MP MUST terminate the backup LSP and re-create the
   protected LSP.  If the MP is the egress router of the protected LSP,
   it MUST also terminate the protected LSP.  If the MP is a transit
   router of the LSP, it MUST send a Path message downstream for the
   protected LSP.  The Path message has the sender address in
   SENDER_TEMPLATE object set to the original address of the ingress
   router, based on the above received Protected LSP Sender IPv4 Address
   TLV or Protected LSP Sender IPv6 Address TLV.  The Path message MUST
   NOT carry any Protected LSP Sender IPv4 Address TLV or Protected LSP
   Sender IPv6 Address TLV in LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object.

   The MP MUST allocate a label for the backup LSP, and distribute it to
   the PLR via Resv message of the backup LSP.  If the protected LSP is
   a sub-LSP of a P2MP LSP and there is an existing sibling sub-LSP
   whose backup LSP is tunneled through the same bypass LSP, the MP MUST
   allocate the same label as the sibling sub-LSP, in order to avoid
   traffic duplication at the PLR.

   When the MP receives a PathTear message for the backup LSP, it MUST
   bring down both the backup LSP and the protected LSP.  If the MP is a
   transit router of the protected LSP, it MUST send a PathTear message
   downstream for the protected LSP.

   In any cases where the MP receives or originates a PathErr or
   ResvTear message for the protected LSP, the MP MUST send the same
   type of message to the PLR for the backup LSP.

3.5.  Local Revertive Mode

   When the failed link or node is restored, the PLR MAY revert the
   protected LSP to its desired primary path, by following the procedure
   of local revertive mode described in [RFC 4090].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new flag for the Attribute Flags TLV, which
   is carried in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object of Path message.  This flag
   is used to communicate whether setup protection is desired for an
   LSP.  The value of the new flag needs to be assigned by IANA.

      Setup Protection Desired: TBD

   This document defines two new RSVP Attributes TLVs, which are carried
   in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object of Path message.  The values of
   the new types need to be assigned by IANA.

      Protected LSP Sender IPv4 Address TLV

      Protected LSP Sender IPv6 Address TLV
