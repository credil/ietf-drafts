        Coloring based IP Flow Performance Measurement Framework
              draft-chen-coloring-based-ipfpm-framework-01

Abstract

   By setting one unused bit of the IP header of packets to "color" the
   packets into different color blocks, it naturally gives a way to
   measure the real packet loss and delay without inserting any extra
   OAM packets.  This is called "coloring" based IP Flow Performance
   Measurement (IPFPM).  This document specifies a framework and
   protocol for this "coloring" based IPFPM.

1.  Introduction

   Performance Measurement (PM) is an important tool that can not only
   provide Service Level Agreement (SLA) verification but facilitate in
   trouble shooting (e.g., fault localization or fault delimitation) and
   network visualization.

   There are two types of performance measurement: one is active
   performance measurement, and the other is passive performance
   measurement.

   In active performance measurement the receiver measures the injected
   packets to evaluate the performance of a path.  The active
   measurement measures the performance of the extra injected packets,
   the rate, numbers and interval of the injected packets will largely
   affect the accuracy of the results.  In addition, it also requires
   that the injected packets have to follow the same path as the real
   traffic; this normally cannot be guaranteed in the pure IP network.
   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) [RFC4656] and Two-Way
   Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) [RFC5357] are tools to enable
   active performance measurement.

   In passive performance measurement, no artificial traffic is injected
   into the flow and measurements are taken to record the performance
   metrics of the real traffic.  The Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) PM protocol [RFC6374] for packet loss is an example of passive
   performance measurement.  By periodically inserting auxiliary
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) packets, the
   traffic is delimited by the OAM packets into consecutive blocks, and
   the receivers count the packets and calculate the packets loss each
   block.

   But, when the OAM channel is in-band, solutions like [RFC6374] are
   not pure passive measurement as the OAM packets are inserted into the
   data stream.  Furthermore because solutions like [RFC6374] depend on
   the fixed positions of the delimiting OAM packets for packets
   counting, they are vulnerable to out-of-order arrival of packets.
   This could happen particularly with out-of-band OAM channels, but
   might also happen with in-band OAM because of the presence of
   multipath forwarding within the network.  Out of order delivery of
   data and the delimiting OAM can give rise to inaccuracies in the
   performance measurement figures.  The scale of these inaccuracies
   will depend on data speeds and the variation in delivery, but with
   out-of-band OAM, this could result in significant differences between
   real and reported performance.

   This document describes a mechanism where data packets are marked or
   "colored" so that they form blocks of data.  No additional delimiting

   OAM is needed and the performance can be measured in-service without
   the insertion of additional traffic.  Furthermore, because coloring
   based IP performance measurement does not require extra OAM packets
   for traffic delimitation, it can be used in situations where there is
   packets re-ordering.  This document specifies a framework and
   protocol for the "coloring" based IP Flow Performance Measurement
   (IPFPM).


2.  Overview and Concept

   The concept of "coloring" IP packets for performance measurement is
   described in [I-D.tempia-opsawg-p3m].  By "coloring" the packets of a
   specific IP flow to different colors, it naturally splits the IP flow
   into deferent consecutive blocks.

   For packet loss measurement, there are two ways to color packets:
   fixed packet numbers or fixed time period for each color block.  This
   document only talks about the way of fixed time period.  The sender
   and receiver nodes count the transmitted and received packets/octets
   based on each color block.  By collecting and comparing the
   transmitted and received packets/octets, it can easily detect whether
   there is packet loss and how many packets/octets get lost.

   For packet delay measurement, there are two solutions.  One is
   similar to packet loss, it still colors the IP flow to different
   color blocks and uses the time when color changing as the reference
   time for delay calculation.  This solution requires that there must
   not be any out-of-order packets, otherwise, the result will not be
   accurate.  Because it uses the first packet of each color block for
   delay measurement, if there is packet reordering, the first packet of
   each block at the sender will be probably different from the first
   packet of the block at the receiver.  The other way is to
   periodically color a single packet of the IP flow.  Within a time
   period, there is only one packet can be colored.  The sender records
   the timestamp when the colored packet is transmitted, the receiver
   records the timestamp when detecting the colored packet.  With the
   two timestamps, the packet delay can be computed.

   To make the above solutions work, two conditions are required.  The
   first one is that there have to be a way to collect the packet counts
   and timestamps from the senders and receivers to a centralized
   calculation element.  The IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX)
   [RFC5101] protocol is used for collecting the performance measurement
   statistic information (Section 5 of this document).  The second is
   that the centralized calculation element has to know what exactly a
   pair of packet counts(one from the sender and the other is from the
   receiver) are based on the same color block and a pair of timestamps

   (one from the sender and the other is from the receiver) are based on
   the same colored packet.  The "Period Number" based solution (Section
   4.2 of this document) is introduced to achieve this.


3.  Reference Model and Functional Components

3.1.  Reference Model

   An Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) reference model (as shown in
   Figure 1) is introduced in this document.  For a specific IP flow,
   there may be one or more upstream and downstream Measurement Points
   (MPs).  An IP flow can be identified by the Source IP (SIP) and
   Destination IP (DIP) addresses, and it may combine the SIP and DIP
   with any or all of the Protocol number, the Source port, the
   Destination port, and the Type of Service (TOS) to identify an IP
   flow.  For each flow, there will be a flow identifier that is unique
   within a certain administrative domain.

   An MP is a network node.  From the measurement point of view, it
   consists of two parts (as shown in Figure 2): Data Collecting Point
   (DCP), and Target Logical Port (TLP).  For an MP, there is only one
   DCP and may be one or more TLPs.  The Measurement Control Point (MCP)
   is a centralized calculation element, MPs periodically report their
   measurement data to the MCP for final performance calculation.  The
   report protocol is defined Section 5 of this document.

   The reason for choosing MP2MP model is that it can satisfy all the
   scenarios that include Point-to-Point (P2P), Point-to-Multipoint
   (P2MP), Multipoint-to-Point (MP2P), and MP2MP.  P2P scenario is
   obvious and can be used anywhere.  P2MP and MP2P are very common in
   mobile backhaul networks.  For example, a Cell Site Gateway (CSG)
   multi-homing to two Radio Network Controller (RNC) Site Gateways
   (RSGs) is a typical network design.  When there is a failure, there
   is a requirement to monitor the flows between the CSG and the two
   RSGs hence to determine whether the fault is in the transport network
   or in the wireless network(this is normally called "fault
   delimitation").  This is especially useful in the situation where the
   transport network belongs to one service provider and wireless
   network belongs to other service providers.

3.2.  Functional Components

3.2.1.  Measurement Control Point

   The MCP is responsible for calculating the final performance metrics
   according to the received measurement data from the MPs (actually
   from the DCPs).  For packet loss, based on each color block, the
   difference between the total counts received from all upstream MPs
   and the total counts received from all downstream MPs are the lost
   packet numbers.  The MCP must make sure that the counts from the
   upstream MPs and downstream MPs are related to the same color block.
   For packet delay (e.g., one way delay), the difference between the
   timestamps from the downstream MP and upstream MP is the packet
   delay.  Similarly to packet loss, the MCP must make sure the two
   timestamps are based on the same colored packet.

   This document introduces a Period Number (PN) based synchronization
   mechanism to help the MCP to determine whether any two or more packet
   counts (from distributed MPs) are related to the same color block or
   any two timestamps are related to the same colored packet.  The PN is
   generated each time a DCP reads the packet counts and timestamps from
   the TLP, and is equal to the modulo of the local time (when the
   counts and timestamps are read) and the interval of the color time
   period.  Each packet count and timestamp has a PN when reported to
   the MCP, and the same PN means that they are related to the same

   color block or colored packet.  This requires that the upstream and
   downstream MPs having a certain time synchronization capability
   (e.g., supporting the Network Time Protocol (NTP) [RFC5905], or the
   IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) [IEEE1588].) and assumes that
   the upstream and downstream MPs have already time synchronized.
   Since is the intention to measure packet delay, this requirement for
   time synchronization is already present.

3.2.2.  Data Collecting Point

   The DCP is responsible for periodically collecting the measurement
   data from the TLPs and for reporting the data to the MCP.  In
   addition, when to change the color, when to color a packet (for
   packet delay measurement), and when to read the packet counts and
   timestamps are also controlled by DCP.  Each DCP will maintain two
   timers, one (C-timer, used at upstream DCP) is for color changing,
   the other (R-timer, used at downstream DCP) is for reading the packet
   counts and timestamps.  The two timers have the same time interval
   but are started at different times.  A DCP can be either an upstream
   or a downstream DCP: the role is specific to an IP flow.  For a
   specific IP flow, the upstream DCP will change the color and read the
   packet counts and timestamps when the C-timer expires, the downstream
   DCP just reads the packets counts and timestamps when the R-timer
   expires.  In order to allow for a certain degree of packets re-
   ordering, the R-timer should be started later than a defined period
   of time after the C-timer is started (e.g., 1/3 or 2/3 T, where T is
   the interval of the C-timer).  It recommends that: for packet loss
   measurement, the R-timer should be started at 1/3 T after the C-Timer
   is started, and for packet delay measurement, the R-timer should be
   started at 2/3 T after the C-Timer is started.

   To make the implementation simple, the C-timer should be started at
   the beginning of each time period.  This document recommends the
   implementation to support at least these time periods (1s, 10s, 1min,
   10min and 1h).  So, if the time period is 10s, the C-timer should be
   started at the time of any multiples of 10 in seconds (e.g., 0s, 10s,
   20s, etc.), then the R-timer should be started, for example, at the
   time of T+1/3 or 2/3 T. With this method, each DCP can independently
   start its C-timer and R-timer given that the clocks have been
   synchronized.

3.2.3.  Target Logical Port

   The TLP is a logical entity that actually executes the final
   measurement actions (e.g., colors the packets, counts the packets,
   records the timestamps, etc.).  Normally, a physical interface
   corresponds to a TLP, and the TLP resides in the data plane.  For a
   measurement instance (corresponding to an IP flow), a TLP will

   maintain a pairs of packet counters and a timestamp counter for each
   color block.  One packet counter is for counting packets and the
   other is for counting octets.


4.  Principles of Coloring based IPFPM

   The flows discussed in this document are all unidirectional.  For a
   specific flow, there will be upstream and downstream TLPs and
   upstream and downstream packet counts/timestamp accordingly.

4.1.  Packet Loss Measurement

   For packet loss measurement, this document defines the following
   counters and quantities:

   U-CountP[n][m]: U-CountP identifies the packets transmitted by a
   upstream TLP, the "n" identifies the "period number" of the measured
   color block, the "m" identifies the No. m TLP of the upstream TLPs.

   D-CountP[n][m]: U-CountP identifies the packets received by a
   downstream TLP, the "n" identifies the "period number" of the
   measured color block, the "m" identifies the No. m TLP of the
   downstream TLPs.

   U-CountO[n][m]: U-CountO identifies the octets transmitted by a
   upstream TLP, the "n" identifies the "period number" of the measured
   color block, the "m" identifies the No. m TLP of the upstream TLPs.

   D-CountO[n][m]: U-CountO identifies the packets received by a
   downstream TLP, the "n" identifies the "period number" of the
   measured color block, the "m" identifies the No. m TLP of the
   downstream TLPs.

   LossP: the number of packets transmitted by the upstream TLPs but not
   received at the downstream TLPs.

   LossO: the total octets transmitted by the upstream TLPs but not
   received at the downstream TLPs.

   The the total packet loss of a flow can be computed as follows:

   LossP = U-CountP[1][1] + U-CountP[1][2].... + U-CountP[n][m] -
   D-CountP[1][1]-D-CountP[1][2]-D-CountP[n][m'].

   LossO = U-CountO[1][1] + U-CountO[1][2].... + U-CountO[n][m] -
   D-CountO[1][1]-D-CountO[1][2]-D-CountO[n][m'].

   Where the m is the number of the upstream TLPs, and the m' is the
   number of the downstream TLPs.

4.2.  Packet Delay Measurement

   For packet delay measurement, there will be only one upstream TLP and
   may be one or more (P2MP) downstream TLPs.  Although the coloring
   based IPFPM supports P2MP model, this document only discusses P2P
   model, the P2MP model is left for future study.  This document
   defines the following timestamps and quantities:

   U-Time[n]: U-Time identifies the time when sent a colored packet, the
   "n" identifies the "period number" of the colored packet.

   D-Time[n]: D-Time identifies the time when received a colored packet,
   the "n" identifies the "period number" of the colored packet.  This
   is only for P2P model.

   D-Time[n][m]: D-Time identifies the time when received a colored
   packet, the "n" identifies the "period number" of the colored packet,
   the "m" identifies the No. m TLP of the downstream TLPs.  This is for
   P2MP model and is left for future study.

   One-way Delay[n]: The one-way delay metric for packet networks is
   described in [RFC2679].  The "n" identifies the "period number" of
   the colored packet.

   One-way Delay[1] = D-Time[1] - U-Time[1].

   One-way Delay[2] = D-Time[2] - U-Time[2].

   ...

   One-way Delay[n] = D-Time[n] - U-Time[n].

   In the case of two-way delay, the delay is the sum of the two one-way
   delays of the two flows that have the same TLPs but have opposite
   directions.

   Two-way Delay[1] = (D-Time[1] - U-Time[1]) + (D-Time'[1] -
   U-Time'[1]).

   Two-way Delay[2] = (D-Time[2] - U-Time[2]) + (D-Time'[2] -

   Where the D-Time and U-Time are for one forward flow, the D-Time' and
   U-Time' are for reverse flow.


5.  Color Bits Selection

   This document does not specify which bits should be used for
   coloring, it just introduces some options that the operators can
   select for packet coloring usage.  There are not too much bits in the
   IP header that can be used for IP packet coloring, this document
   introduces two options:

   One is to use the reserved bit of the Flag field.  There is only one
   bit that is left, so it cannot be used for packet loss and delay
   measurement simultaneously.

   The other option is to use some "unused" bits of the Type Of Service
   (TOS) field.

   For both options, the operators should carefully think of the color
   bits selection to make sure that the setting or changing of the color
   bits SHOULD NOT affect the normal packet forwarding and process.

   The implementations should provide some knobs for operators to
   configure and change the color bits according to their network design
   and policies.


6.  Statistic Information Report

   As described in Section 4 of this document, when the performance
   measurement started, each DCP will periodically report performance
   measurement statistic information to the MCP, and the MCP will
   compute the final performance measurement results according to the
   received statistic information.

   For a specific IP flow, whatever for packet delay or loss
   measurement, there will be at least one upstream and one downstream
   DCP.  As described above section, time synchronization is required
   and the Period Number is used for MCP to identify and correlate the
   packet counts and timestamps from the upstream and downstream DCPs to
   a specific color block or colored packet.

   For packet loss measurement, the following information is required to
   report to the MCP:

   to the MCP, the following information may be included:

      DCP Identifier

      DCP Status

      Others

6.1.  IPFIX for coloring based IPFPM

   The IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] defines how IP Flow information can be
   exported from routers, measurement probes, or other devices.  It
   defines many Information Elements [RFC5102] that can be used to carry
   and export the above information from DCP to MCP.  Except the Period
   Number and DCP Status, all the above information can be identified
   with the existing Information Elements.

      DCP Identifier: exporterIPv4Address/exporterIPv6Address (130/131)

      TLP Identifier: meteringProcessId (143)

6.1.1.  Information Element for IPFPM

6.1.1.1.  periodNumber

   Description: The periodNumber is used to identify a packet count or
   timestamp that belongs to a specific color block or colored packet.
   The MCP uses it to determine whether any two or more packet counts
   (from distributed DCPs) are related to the same color block or any
   two timestamps are related to the same colored packet.  The PN is
   generated each time a DCP reads the packet counts and timestamp from
   the TLP, and is equal to the modulo of the local time (when the
   counts and timestamps are read) and the interval of the color time
   period.

   Abstract Data Type: unsigned32

   ElementId: TBD

   Status: current

6.1.1.2.  dcpStatus

   the DCP is time synchronized, otherwise, the DCP is not time
   synchronized.  The MCP MUST calculate the results when all related
   DCPs of a flow are time synchronized, otherwise, the results will not
   correct.

   The exporterIPv4Address is used to carry the DCP ID.

   The meteringProcessId is used to carry the TLP ID.

   The flowId is a identifier that is unique within a specific
   administrative domain (e.g., an Autonomous System).  The TLP, DCP and
   MCP have to agree a flow identifier related to a specific flow.  For
   example, the flow identifier can be generated and maintained by a
   centralized element.  How to generate and maintain the flowId is out
   the scope of this document.

   The flowId has the following structure, it consists of two parts: one
   the Reserved field that is left for future extensions, the other is
   the Identifier field is 24-bit in length.
