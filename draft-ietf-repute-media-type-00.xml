 <section title="Introduction">
  <t> This memo defines a media type for use when answering a reputation query
      using the "long form" query defined in RFCxxxx+4, which uses
      <xref target="HTTP"/>.  It is part of a series defining the overall
      reputation query/response structure as well as the concept of
      reputation "vocabularies" for particular applications. </t>

  <t> Also included is the specification for an IANA registry to contain
      definitions and symbolic names for known reputation vocabularies.  </t>

 <section title="Description" anchor="descr">
  <t> A new media type, "application/reputon", is defined for the
      representation of reputational data.  This media type has two optional
      parameters: "app", which conveys the specific application of reputation
      data in use, and usually extends the set of data values that MAY be
      included in the media object itself; and "format", which specifies
      the format with which the content are relayed. </t>

  <t> The default for "format" is "text", which is defined here. 
      Reputons bearing unrecognized format values MUST be ignored. </t>

  <t> The body of the media type consists of <xref target="MAIL"/>-style
      attribute/value pairs.  The following are REQUIRED for all applications:

      <list style="hanging">
	<t hangText="RATER:"> The identity of the entity providing the
		reputation information, generally expressed as a DNS domain
		name. </t>

	<t hangText="ASSERTION:"> A keyword indicating the specific assertion
		or claim being rated.  In the absence of an "app" parameter,
		the reputon can only indicate generic goodness, with the
		default assertion "IS-GOOD," but each application is expected
		to define additional types of ASSERTION. </t>

	<t hangText="RATED:"> The identity of the entity being rated. </t>

	<t hangText="RATING:"> The overall rating score for that entity,
		expressed as a floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0
		inclusive.  See <xref target="scores"/> for discussion. </t>
        </list> </t>

  <t> The following are OPTIONAL for all applications, to be used in contexts
      where they are appropriate:

      <list style="hanging">
	<t hangText="CONFIDENCE:"> The level of confidence the reputation
		provider has in the value presented being accurate, expressed
		as a floating-point number between 0 and 1 inclusive. </t>

	<t hangText="RATER-AUTHENTICITY:"> The level of confidence in that
		identity being genuine, expressed as a floating-point
		number between 0 and 1 inclusive. </t>

	<t hangText="SAMPLE-SIZE:"> The number of data points used to compute
		that score, possibly an approximation.  Expressed as an
		unsigned 64-bit integer.  The units are deliberately not
		specified, since not all reputation service providers will
		collect data the same way.  Consumers will need to determine
		out-of-band the units being reported and apply this value
		accordingly within their local policies. </t>
      </list> </t>

  <t> A particular application that registers itself with IANA MAY also define
      extension attribute/value pairs beyond these standard ones. </t>

  <t> Thus, the following example:

	<figure><artwork>
      Content-type: application/reputon

      RATER: RatingsRUs.example.com
      RATER-AUTHENTICITY: 1.0
      ASSERTION: IS-GOOD
      RATED: Alex Rodriguez
      RATING: 0.99
      SAMPLE-SIZE: 50000
	</artwork></figure> </t>

  <t> ...indicates that we are absolutely sure (1.0) that the entity
      "RatingsRUs.example.com" consolidated 50000 data points (perhaps from
      everyone in Yankee Stadium) and concluded that Alex Rodriguez is
      very very good (0.99) at something.  It doesn't tell us what he's
      good at, and while it might be playing baseball, it could just as
      well be paying his taxes on time. </t>

  <t> A more sophisticated usage would define a baseball application with a
      vocabulary of specific assertions, so that this example:

	<figure><artwork>
      Content-type: application/reputon; app="baseball"

      RATER: baseball-reference.example.com
      RATER-AUTHENTICITY: 1.0
      ASSERTION: HITS-FOR-POWER
      RATED: Alex Rodriguez
      RATING: 0.99
      SAMPLE-SIZE: 50000
	</artwork></figure> </t>

  <t> ...would indicate that 50000 fans polled by the entity
      baseball-reference.example.com rate A-Rod very highly in hitting for
      power, whereas this example:

	<figure><artwork>
      Content-type: application/reputon; app="baseball"

      RATER: baseball-reference.example.com
      RATER-AUTHENTICITY: 1.0
      ASSERTION: CLUTCH-HITTER
      RATED: Alex Rodriguez
      RATING: 0.4
      SAMPLE-SIZE: 50000
	</artwork></figure> </t>

  <t> ...would indicate that a similar poll indicated a somewhat weaker
      consensus that A-Rod tends to choke in critical baseball situations. </t>

  <t> In practice, most usage of reputons is expected to make use of the
      "app" parameter to target an application-specific set of assertions. </t>

  <section title="Formal Definition" anchor="abnf">
   <t> More formally, using <xref target="ABNF"/>, the content of the
       application/reputon MIME object MUST conform to the following syntax:

	<figure><artwork>
reputon := rater rater-auth assertion *extension
           rated rating sampsize

rater := "RATER:"
         *WSP (atom / quoted-string) [CFWS] CRLF

rater-auth := "RATER-AUTHENTICITY:"
              *WSP 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT [CFWS] CRLF
           ; must be a number between -1 and 1 inclusive

assertion := "ASSERTION:"
             *WSP dot-atom-text [CFWS] CRLF

extension := dot-atom-text %x3A *WSP dot-atom-text [CFWS] CRLF
          ; must be registered with IANA within a reputation
          ; vocabulary registration

rated := "RATED:"
         *WSP (atom / quoted-string) [CFWS] CRLF

rating := "RATING:"
          *WSP 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT [CFWS] CRLF
       ; must be a number between 0 and 1 inclusive

sampsize := "SAMPLE-SIZE":
            *WSP 1*DIGIT [CFWS] CRLF
         ; must be an unsigned 64-bit integer
	</artwork></figure></t>

   <t> "atom", "quoted-string" and "dot-atom-text" are imported from
       <xref target="MAIL"/>. </t>
  </section> <!-- ABNF -->
 </section> <!-- Description -->

 <section title="Scores" anchor="scores">
  <t> The score presented as the value in the RATING parameter appears as a
      floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive.  The intent is that
      the definition of an assertion within an application will declare what
      the anchor values 0.0 and 1.0 specifically mean.  Generally speaking,
      1.0 implies full agreement with the assertion, while 0.0 indicates no
      support for the assertion. </t>

  <t> The definition will also specify the type of scale in use when
      generating scores, to which all reputation service providers for that
      application space must adhere.  This will allow a client to change
      which reputation service provider is being queried for a given
      without having to learn through some out-of-band method what the new
      provider's values mean.  For example, a registration might state that
      ratings are linear, which would mean a score of "x" is twice as strong
      as a value of "x/2". </t>

 <section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="iana_considerations">
  <t> This memo presents two actions for IANA, namely the creation of the new
      media type "application/reputon" and the creation of a registry

      an initial registry entry for the latter. </t>
