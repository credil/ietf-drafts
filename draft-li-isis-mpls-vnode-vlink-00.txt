1.  Introduction

   As the virtual network operators develop, it is desirable to provide
   better network virtualization solutions to facilitate the service
   provision.  [I-D.li-mpls-network-virtualization-framework] proposes a
   new framework to implement MPLS virtual network based on the
   architecture of central controlled IGP.  It is to allocate MPLS
   global label for the virtual network topologies, network nodes and
   links by an IGP controller to IGP clients.  Thus MPLS global labels
   becomes the unique identifications in the underlying networks to
   compose the virtual networks.  This document defines the
   corresponding IS-IS protocol extensions and procedures to implement
   virtual nodes and links based on MPLS global label.  The other
   document [I-D.li-isis-mpls-multi-topology] defines the corresponding
   IS-IS protocol extensions and procedures to support MPLS Multi-
   Topology.

2.  Terminology

   Underlying Network: It is the network which the virtual network is
   built based on.  The underlying network can be the physical network
   or the virtual network.

   MPLS Virtual Network: The virtual network is built based on the
   underlying network.  It is composed by virtual nodes and virtual
   links which are identified by MPLS global label.  In this document,
   the concept of virtual network is the same as that of MPLS virtual
   network.

   Underlying Link: It is the link in the underlying network which the
   virtual link is built based on.  The underlying link can be physical
   link or the virtual link.

   MPLS Virtual Link: The virtual link is built based on the underlying
   link with specific attribute requirement.  It can be identified by
   MPLS global label.  In this document, the concept of virtual link is
   the same as that of MPLS virtual link.

   Underlying Node: It is the node in the underlying network which the
   virtual node is built based on.  The underlying node can be physical
   node or the virtual node.

   MPLS Virtual Node: The virtual node is built based on the underlying
   node with specific attribute requirement.  It can be identified by
   MPLS global label.  In this document, the concept of virtual node is
   the same as that of MPLS virtual node.

3.  Overview

   [I-D.li-rtgwg-cc-igp-arch] defines the central controlled
   architecture for IGP.  In
   [I-D.li-mpls-network-virtualization-framework], a new framework is
   defined to implement MPLS virtual network based on central controlled
   IGP.

   In the framework, the virtual nodes can be identified by the global
   label allocated for the tuple {Multi-Topology ID, Underlying Node
   Identification, Attributes of the Virtualized Node}. Multi-topology
   ID is the identification of the corresponding multi-topology of the
   underlying network.  The underlying node can be identified by the
   node's address (typically the loopback address) if the underlying
   node is the physical network node or it can be identified by another
   global label corresponding to the underlying virtual node.  The label
   bindings for the virtual nodes are flooded from the IGP controller to
   the IGP clients.  When IGP clients receives the label binding, it can

   install the MPLS forwarding entry to map the incoming label to the
   forwarding information related with the virtual node.

   In the framework, the virtual links can be identified by the global
   label allocated for the tuple {Multi-Topology ID, Underlying Link
   Identification, Attributes of the Virtualized Link}. Multi-topology
   ID is the identification of the corresponding multi-topology of the
   underlying network.  The underlying link can be identified by the
   link ID or the link's address (typically the pair of the addresses of
   two end-points of the link) if the underlying link is the physical
   network link or it can be identified by another global label
   corresponding to the underlying virtual link.  The label bindings for
   the virtual links are flooded from the IGP controller to the IGP
   clients.  When IGP clients receives the label binding, it can install
   the MPLS forwarding entry to map the incoming label to the forwarding
   information related with the virtual link.

3.1.  Application for QoS-based Segment Routing

   MPLS virtual links and nodes can be used for the segment routing
   defined in [I-D.filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing].  The MPLS virtual
   node is just like the Node Segment in the Segment Routing.  The MPLS
   virtual link is just like the Adjacency Segment in the Segment
   Routing.  When the bandwidth attribute is applied to the MPLS virtual
   node or the MPLS virtual link, network nodes should reserve the
   bandwidth to provide QoS service of bandwidth guarantee for the
   virtual link or the virtual node.  When this type of virtual links
   and the virtual nodes are grouped together to implement segment
   routing, the end-to-end QoS service are guaranteed in the underlying
   network.

4.  IS-IS Extensions

   The IS-IS Label Mapping TLV is defined in
   [I-D.li-isis-mpls-multi-topology] which consists of pairs of Label
   sub-TLVs and FEC sub-TLVs.  The Label Mapping TLV needs to be used to
   send label mapping for MPLS virtual nodes and links.  In these TLV,
   the Label sub-TLV defined in [I-D.li-isis-mpls-multi-topology]
   contains the global label value for the virtual node or the virtual
   link.  In this document new types of sub-TLVs are defined as the FEC
   for the MPLS virual node and the MPLS virtual link.

4.1.  IPv4 MPLS Virtual Node Sub-TLV

   When implement virtual node, the global label is allocated for the
   tuple {Multi-Topology ID, Underlying Node Identification, Attributes
   of the Virtualized Node}. The IPv4 MPLS Virtual Node sub-TLV has
   following format:

   o Type: 1 octet of sub-TLV type.  It is to be allocated by IANA.

   o Length: 1 octet of length of the value field of the sub-TLV.  It is
   up to 252 octets.

   o Flags: 1 octet of flags of the virtual link.  Now 1 bit is defined
   as "Bi-directional Bit".  If the bit is set, it means the virtual
   link is bi-directional.  If the bit is 0, it means the virtual link
   is uni-directional.

   o Multi-Topology ID: 4 octets.  It contains the ID of the underlying
   MPLS Multi-Topology based on which the virtual links are created.

   o Source End-Point Address: it is the 128-bit IPv6 address of the
   source end-point of the underlying link based on which the virtual
   links are created.

   o Destination End-Point Address: it is the 128-bit IPv6 address of
   the destination end-point of the underlying link based on which the
   virtual links are created.

   o Attributes of Virtual Node: It contains attributes of the virtual
   node which length can be variable.

   In this type of Virtual Link Sub-TLV, the underlying link is
   identified by the link's IPv6 address (typically the pair of the IPv6
   addresses of two end-points of the link) . For the virtual link which
   is built based on the underlying MPLS virtual node identified by a
   MPLS global label or the virtual link which is built based on the
   underlying link identified by Link ID, the sub-TLV will be defined in
   a future version.

4.5.  Attribute Sub-TLV

   When build MPLS virtual node or virtual link, attributes are
   necessary.  The attribute sub-TLV has following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3

4.6.  Procedures

4.6.1.  Sending

   When the IGP controller needs to implement the MPLS virtual node, the
   IGP controller MUST originate a new LSP comprising the Label Mapping
   TLV for the MPLS virtual node.  The Label Mapping TLV MUST contains
   one or more pairs of the Global Label sub-TLV and the Virtual Node
   sub-TLV.  If the length of these sub-TLVs can exceeds 252 octets,
   there SHOULD be Multiple Label Mapping TLV in IS-IS LSP.

   When the IGP controller needs to implement the MPLS virtual link, the
   IGP controller MUST originate a new LSP comprising the Label Mapping
   TLV for the MPLS virtual link.  The Label Mapping TLV MUST contains
   one or more pairs of the Global Label sub-TLV and the Virtual Link
   sub-TLV.  If the length of these sub-TLVs can exceeds 252 octets,
   there SHOULD be Multiple Label Mapping TLV in IS-IS LSP.  If the
   bandwidth needs to be reserved on the underlying link for the virtual
   link, the Bandwidth Attribute sub-TLV MUST be included in the MPLS
   Virtual Link sub-TLV to indicate the class-type and the bandwidth to
   be reserved.

4.6.2.  Receiving

   When receiving the Label Mapping to implement the MPLS virtual node,
   the IGP clients SHOULD install MPLS forwarding entry to map the
   incoming label to the forwarding information related with the virtual
   node.

   When receiving the Label Mapping to implement the MPLS virtual link,
   the IGP clients SHOULD install MPLS forwarding entry to map the
   incoming label to the forwarding information related with the virtual
   link.  If Bandwidth Attribute sub-TLV is included in the MPLS Virtual
   Link sub-TLV, the bandwidth of the class-type specified in the sub-
   TLV MUST be reserved accordingly.

5.  Compatibility

   Routers that do not support these MPLS Virtualization extensions
   SHOULD silently ignore the TLV and the sub-TLVs defined in this
   document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document request to allocate a type value for the IPv4 MPLS
   Virtual Node sub-TLV, a type value for the IPv6 MPLS Virtual Node
   sub-TLV, a type value for the IPv4 MPLS Virtual Link sub-TLV, a type
   value for the IPv6 MPLS Virtual Link sub-TLV and a type value for the
   Bandwidth Attribute sub-TLV.

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
