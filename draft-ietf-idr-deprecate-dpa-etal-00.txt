Internet-Draft          Deprecation of DPA et al           December 2012


1.  Introduction

   As of this writing the BGP Path Attributes registry maintained by
   IANA contains entries for DPA, ADVERTISER, and RCID_PATH /
   CLUSTER_ID.  The first of these is associated with
   [draft-ietf-idr-bgp-dpa-05], an Internet Draft that was abandoned in
   1996.  The latter are associated with [RFC1863], an RFC that was
   reclassified as Historic by [RFC4223] in 2005.  Neither of these
   specifications is in use now, nor ever was.

   Note that the deprecated CLUSTER_ID is distinct from CLUSTER_LIST
   [RFC4456].  CLUSTER_LIST is not being deprecated.


2.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to mark the BGP Path Attributes registry
   entries for DPA (Value 11), ADVERTISER (Value 12), and RCID_PATH /
   CLUSTER_ID (Value 13) as "Deprecated".


3.  Security Considerations

   There are no meaningful security consequences arising from this
   registry update.
