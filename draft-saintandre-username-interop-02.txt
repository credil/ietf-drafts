Abstract

   Various Internet protocols define constructs for usernames, i.e., the
   local part of an address such as "localpart@example.com".  This
   document describes a subset of characters to allow in usernames for
   maximal interoperability across Internet protocols.  The subset might
   prove useful in cases where a provider offers multiple services using
   the same underlying identifier.

Internet-Draft          Username Interoperability           October 2013


1.  Introduction

   Various Internet protocols define constructs for usernames, i.e., the
   local part of an address such as "localpart@example.com".  This
   document describes a subset of characters to allow in usernames for
   maximal interoperability across Internet protocols.  The subset might
   prove useful in cases where a provider offers multiple services using
   the same underlying identifier.


2.  Terminology

   Many important terms used in this document are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-precis-framework], [RFC6365], and [UNICODE].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  Subset

   To define an interoperable subset of characters for local parts of
   application identifiers, this document specifies a profile of the
   PRECIS IdentifierClass specified in [I-D.ietf-precis-framework].  In
   essence, the IdentifierClass restricts the allowable characters to
   letters and digits from all the scripts of Unicode [UNICODE] while
   grandfathering in all the characters from the ASCII range [RFC20].
   The profile defined here, "UsernameIdentifierClass", further
   restricts the characters from the ASCII range to those known to work
   across multiple application protocols (as described under
   Appendix A).

   The syntax is defined as follows using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) as specified in [RFC5234].

      uname = 1*1023(upoint)
            ;
            ; a "upoint" is a UTF-8 encoded Unicode code point
            ; that conforms to the "UsernameIdentifierClass"
            ; profile of the PRECIS IdentifierClass
            ;

   A uname MUST consist only of Unicode code points that conform to the
   "UsernameIdentifierClass" profile of the "IdentifierClass" base
   string class defined in [I-D.ietf-precis-framework].  The
   UsernameIdentifierClass profile includes all code points allowed by

   the IdentifierClass base class, with the exception of the following
   characters, which are disallowed:

      U+0022 (QUOTATION MARK), i.e., '"'
      U+0023 (NUMBER SIGN), i.e., '#'
      U+0025 (PERCENT SIGN), i.e., '%'
      U+0026 (AMPERSAND), i.e., '&'
      U+0027 (APOSTROPHE), i.e., "'"
      U+0028 (LEFT PARENTHESIS), i.e., '('
      U+0029 (RIGHT PARENTHESIS), i.e., ')'
      U+002C (COMMA), i.e., ','
      U+002E (FULL STOP), i.e., '.'
      U+002F (SOLIDUS), i.e., '/'
      U+003A (COLON), i.e., ':'
      U+003B (SEMICOLON), i.e., ';'
      U+003C (LESS-THAN SIGN), i.e., '<'
      U+003E (GREATER-THAN SIGN), i.e., '>'
      U+003F (QUESTION MARK), i.e., '?'
      U+0040 (COMMERCIAL AT), i.e., '@'
      U+005B (LEFT SQUARE BRACKET), i.e., '['
      U+005C (REVERSE SOLIDUS), i.e., '\'
      U+005D (RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET), i.e., ']'
      U+005E (CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT), i.e., '^'
      U+0060 (GRAVE ACCENT), i.e., '`'
      U+007B (LEFT CURLY BRACKET), i.e., '{'
      U+007C (VERTICAL), i.e., '|'
      U+007D (RIGHT CURLY BRACKET), i.e., '}'

   The normalization and mapping rules for the UsernameIdentifierClass
   are as follows, where the operations specified MUST be completed in
   the order shown:

   1.  Fullwidth and halfwidth characters MUST be mapped to their
       decomposition equivalents.

   2.  So-called additional mappings MAY be applied, such as those
       defined in [I-D.ietf-precis-mappings].

   3.  Uppercase and titlecase characters MUST be mapped to their
       lowercase equivalents.

   4.  All characters MUST be mapped using Unicode Normalization Form C
       (NFC).


   With regard to directionality, applications MUST apply the "Bidi
   Rule" defined in [RFC5893] (i.e., each of the six conditions of the
   Bidi Rule must be satisfied).

Internet-Draft          Username Interoperability           October 2013


   A uname MUST NOT be zero octets in length and MUST NOT be more than
   1023 octets in length.  This rule is to be enforced after any
   normalization and mapping of code points.


4.  Security Considerations

   Deploying usernames that are interoperable across multiple protocols
   could potentially give malicious entities multiple ways to attack an
   account or user.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA shall add the following entry to the PRECIS Profiles
   Registry:

   Name:  UsernameIdentifierClass.
   Applicability:  Usernames that are intended to be interoperable
      across multiple application protocols.
   Base Class:  IdentifierClass.
   Replaces:  None.
   Width Mapping:  Map fullwidth and halfwidth characters to their
      decomposition equivalents.
   Additional Mappings:  None required or recommended.
   Case Mapping:  Map uppercase and titlecase characters to lowercase.
   Normalization:  NFC.
   Directionality:  The "Bidi Rule" defined in RFC 5893 applies.
   Exclusions:  24 non-alphanumeric characters in the ASCII range.
   Enforcement:  Up to the application protocol or deployment.
   Specification:  RFC XXXX.  [Note to RFC Editor: please change XXXX to
      the number issued for this specification.]

Appendix A.  Analysis

   This document takes the following username constructs into
   consideration:

   o  Email addresses [RFC5322]
   o  Kerberos Principal Names [RFC4120]
   o  Network Access Identifiers [RFC4282]
   o  SIP URIs [RFC3261]
   o  Instant messaging URIs [RFC3860] and presence URIs [RFC3856]
   o  XMPP addresses (a.k.a.  Jabber Identifiers) [RFC6120]
   o  Account URIs [I-D.ietf-appsawg-acct-uri]

   Each of those address formats defines something that can be used as
   the "local part" of an address.

   The local part of an email address uses either the "local-part" or
   the "dot-atom-text" rule in [RFC5322].  Here we make the simplifying
   assumption that the "dot-atom-text" rule applies:

Internet-Draft          Username Interoperability           October 2013


      dot-atom-text =  1*atext *("." 1*atext)
      atext         =  ALPHA / DIGIT /    ; Any character except
                       "!" / "#" / "$" /  ; controls, SP, and
                       "%" / "&" / "'" /  ; specials. Used for
                       "*" / "+" / "-" /  ; atoms.
                       "/" / "=" / "?" /
                       "^" / "_" / "`" /
                       "{" / "|" / "}" /
                       "~"

   We make the same simplifying assumption for im: and pres: URIs
   (although their specifications reference [RFC2822]).

   A Kerberos Principal Name is a sequence of strings of type
   KerberosString, where each KerberosString is a GeneralString that is
   constrained to contain only characters in IA5String.

      PrincipalName   ::= SEQUENCE {
              name-type       [0] Int32,
              name-string     [1] SEQUENCE OF KerberosString
      }
      KerberosString  ::= GeneralString (IA5String)

   A Network Address Identifier inherits from [RFC821].  Here we care
   only about the "username" rule:

   The local part of a sip:/sips: URI inherits from the "userinfo" rule
   in [RFC3986] with several changes; here we discuss the SIP "user"
   rule only:

   The local part of an XMPP address allows any ASCII character except
   space, controls, and the " & ' / : < > @ characters.

   The 'acct' URI syntax borrows the 'host', 'pct-encoded', 'sub-
   delims', 'unreserved' rules from [RFC3986]:

   acctURI      =  "acct" ":" userpart "@" host
   userpart     =  unreserved / sub-delims
                   0*( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )

   To summarize the foregoing information, the following table lists the
   allowed and disallowed characters in the local part of identifiers
   for each protocol (aside from the alphanumeric, space, and control
   characters), in order by hexadecimal character number (where each "A"
   row shows the allowed characters and each "D" row shows the
   disallowed characters).
