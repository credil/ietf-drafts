INTERNET-DRAFT              MTU Negotiation                June 14, 2012


1. Introduction

   The base TRILL protocol includes the way RBridges determine the
   minimum inter-RBridge link size for the whole campus (campus-wide
   Sz), for the proper operation of TRILL IS-IS. [RFC6327] defines the
   diagram of state transitions of an adjacency. If MTU testing is in
   effect, the "link MTU size is successfully tested (A6)" is an event
   causing transition between "2-way" state and "Report" state of an
   adjacency. RBridges use what they believe to be the campus-wide Sz to
   do link MTU size testing and a successfully tested link MTU size X
   must be not less than the value of campus-wide Sz [RFC6325]. 

   This document analyzes the possible issues caused by the definition
   that link MTU size testing depends on the collection of campus-wide
   Sz. In order to break the global dependence on campus-wide Sz, link-
   wide Lz, which is the minimum acceptable inter-RBridge link MTU size
   for a link, is used to replace the role of campus-wide in link MTU
   size testing. Based on link-wide Lz, a new link MTU size testing
   algorithm is designed for adjacent RBridges to determine the most
   suitable size of their link MTU.

   There are PDUs which are limited to a local link, such as CSNPs and
   PSNPs. These PDUs should not be confined by the campus-wide Sz.
   Instead, these PDUs should be formatted not greater than the value of
   link-wide Lz. 

1.1. Content

   Section 2 analyzes the issues caused by the dependence on campus-wide
   Sz for link MTU size testing.

   Section 3 defines a new IS-IS MTU negotiation mechanism to update
   [RFC6325].

   Section 4 describes how link traffic MTU can be determined.

1.2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Issues of Current Link MTU Testing

   Link MTU size testing is defined in Section 4.3.2 of [RFC6325]. If
   the link MTU size is smaller than campus-wide value of Sz, which is
   the smallest value of originatingLSPBufferSize advertised by any
   RBridge in its LSP (but not less than 1470)[RFC6325], the link will

   not be included in the global topology. If the link MTU size X of an
   adjacency is successfully tested (X >= campus-wide Sz), its state
   will move from "2-way" to "Report", which is defined in [RFC6327].
   The link MTU size testing depends on the believed value of campus-
   wide Sz, which can be problematic. Some issues causes by this
   dependence are given in the following subsections.

             Figure 2.1: Adjacency campus wide dependence 

   Take Figure 2.1 as an example, all the adjacencies are in report
   states. After RB4 leaves the campus and its LSPs age out, RB2 and RB3
   find the campus-wide Sz grows. They test the MTU according to the new
   value of campus-wide Sz 1800. Since RB2 and RB3 is connected by a
   low-end bridge whose port MTU is 1700. The test will not be
   successful. This adjacency has to return to 2-way state. The state of
   an adjacency can be determined by another remote adjacency. The
   stability of the campus-wide Sz in such a badly configured campus can
   be poor resulting in maintenance problems. (In a well-configured
   campus all RBridges should be configured with the same
   originatingLSPBufferSize.)

2.2. Inconstant Consequences of Wrong Configuration

   Take Figure 2.2 as an example, the originatingLSPBufferSize value of
   RB3 is falsely configured to be greater than its port MTU. The link

   MTU testing is successful because the campus-wide Sz 1600 is smaller
   than the two port MTUs of the adjacency between RB2 and RB3. The
   adjacency will be in "Report" state. However, when RB4 leaves the
   campus and the campus-wide Sz is updated to 1800, the link MTU test
   of link RB2-RB3 cannot be successful.

3. TRILL IS-IS MTU Negotiation

   In order to solve the problems depicted in Section 2, this draft
   introduces a new value "Lz" which is the acceptable inter-RBridge
   link size required by each RBridge. Link-wide Lz is the minimum Lz
   required by all RBridges on a specific link. It is used in link MTU
   size testing to replace the role of campus-wide Sz. A successfully
   tested link MTU size X is not necessarily greater than the value of
   campus-wide Sz any more. Section 3.2 will define how to test this X
   value based on the value of link-wide Lz. 

   Although the introduction of Lz changes the way link MTU size is
   tested, the adjacency state diagram defined in [RFC6327] does not
   change. "Link MTU size is successfully tested (A6)" is still an event
   causing transition between "2-way" state and "Report" state of an
   adjacency.

   The maximum size of PDUs exchanged only between neighbors instead of
   the whole campus should be confined by link-wide Lz instead of the
   campus-wide Sz. CSNPs and PSNPs are such kind of PDUs. They are
   exchanged just on the link after a DRB is selected on the link. 

   As for campus-wide Sz, RBridges continue to propagate their

   originatingLSPBufferSize across the campus through the advertisement
   of LSPs. Each RBridge should format their "campus-wide" PDUs, such as
   LSPs, not greater than what they believe to be the campus-wide Sz.

3.1. Determination of Link-Wide Lz

   RBridges on a LAN link should exchange their assumption on the value
   of "Lz" through IIH using the originatingSNPBufferSize (Sz) contained
   in the PORT-TRILL-VER sub-TLV (see Section 6). The smallest value of
   the Lz collected on a link, but not less than 1470, is the link-wide
   Lz. It is different from the campus-wide Sz which is determined by
   having each RBridge in the campus advertise its own desired value of
   Sz in LSPs as defined in Section 4.3.1 of [RFC6325].

   With IIH, an RBridge gets the value of Lz from its neighbor not later
   than the time when the adjacency moves to 2-way state. An RBridge
   should be aware of what size of PDUs will be accepted by its neighbor
   without exceeding its originatingSNPBufferSize. 

                         Lz:1800             Lz:1800
                          +---+       |       +---+
                          |RB1|(2000)-|-(2000)|RB2|
                          +---+       |       +---+
                                      |
                  Lz:1800             |
                   +---+             +--+
                   |RB3|(2000)-(1700)|B1|
                   +---+             +--+
                                      |

                 Figure 3.1: Link MTU has to be tested 

   Sometimes, even all RBridges on a specific LAN link have reached
   consensus on the value of link-wide Lz, it does not mean that these
   RBridges can safely exchange PDUs between each other. Take Figure 3.1
   as an example. RB1, RB2 and RB3 are three RBridges on the same LAN
   link and their Lz is 1800, so the link-wide Lz of this LAN link is
   1800. There is a intermediate bridge (say B1) between RB2 and RB3
   whose port MTU size is 1700. If RB2 sends PDUs formatted in the size
   of 1800, it will be discarded by B1. Therefore the link MTU size has
   to be tested. After the link MTU size of an adjacency is successfully
   tested, these CSNP and PSNP PDUs will be formatted no greater than
   the tested link MTU size and will be safely transmitted on this link.

   4.3.2 of [RFC6325]. The following Binary Search algorithm in which

   link-wide Lz is used in the testing instead of campus-wide Sz. 

   Step 0: RB1 sends an MTU-probe padded to the size of link-wide Lz. 

   1) If RB1 successfully receives the MTU-ACK to the probe of the value
      of link-wide Lz from RB2, then link MTU size is set to the size of
      link-wide Lz and stop. 

   2) RB1 tries to send an MTU-probe padded to the size 1470. 

      a) If RB1 fails to receive an MTU-ACK from RB2 after k tries
         (where k is a configurable parameter whose default is 3), RB1
         sets the "failed minimum MTU test" flag for RB2 in RB1's Hello
         and stop. 

      b) Link MTU size <-- 1470, X1 <-- 1470, X2 <-- link-wide Lz, X <--
         [(X1 + X2)/2] (Operation "[...]" returns the fraction-rounded-
         up integer.). Repeat Step 1.  

   Step 1: RB1 tries to send an MTU-probe padded to the size X.   

   1) If RB1 fails to receive an MTU-ACK from RB2 after k tries, then: 

         X2 <-- X and X <-- [(X1 + X2)/2]

   2) If RB1 receives an MTU-ACK to a probe of size X from RB2 then: 

         link MTU size <-- X, X1 <-- X and X <-- [(X1 + X2)/2]

   3) If X1 >= X2 or Step 1 has been repeated n times (where n is a
      configurable parameter whose default is 5), stop. Else go to Step
      1.

   Since the execution of the above algorithm can be resource consuming,
   it is recommended that the DRB takes the responsibility to do the
   testing. If the testing is finished and the tested link MTU size is
   smaller than the original link-wide Lz or the minimum Sz that has
   been advertised to the DRB, the DRB SHOULD send the tested link MTU
   size as its local originatingSNPBufferSize in IIH and
   originatingLSPBufferSize in LSP number zero (shorted as LSP0). This
   will trigger other RBridges on the link to update their link-wide Lz
   and campus-wide Sz to be the size of the tested link MTU. Then CSNPs,
   PSNPs and LSPs (including those used for LSP database
   synchronization) can be rightly resized and successfully exchanged on
   the link.

3.3. Re-determining Campus-Wide Sz

INTERNET-DRAFT              MTU Negotiation                June 14, 2012


   RBridges may join in or leave the campus from time to time. The
   campus-wide Sz can become outdated. Section 4.3.1 of [RFC6325] does
   not define when to re-determine the campus-wide Sz. The following
   suggestions are given for campus-wide Sz re-determination.

   1) When a new RBridge whose Sz is smaller than current campus-wide Sz
      joins in the campus, it MUST report its Sz in an LSP which will
      cause other RBridges update their campus-wide Sz. Then the LSPs in
      the campus will be resized to be no greater than the new campus-
      wide Sz. 

   2) When an RB whose originatingLSPBufferSize is right at the campus-
      wide Sz leaves the campus, and its LSPs are purged from the
      remaining campus after reaching MaxAge [ISO10589]. The campus-wide
      Sz ought to be recomputed as well. Frequent LSP "resizing" is
      harmful to the stability of the whole campus, so it should be
      dampened. Within the two kinds of resizing actions, only the
      upward resizing will be dampened. When an upward resizing event
      happens, a timer is set (this is a configurable parameter whose
      default value is 300 seconds). Before this timer expires, all
      subsequent upward resizing will be dampened. In a well-configured
      campus with all RBridges configured to have the same
      originatingLSPBufferSize, no resizing will be necessary.


3.4. Relationship between Port MTU and Sz

   When port MTU size is smaller than the local originatingSNPBufferSize
   (Sz) of an RBridge, this port should be explicitly disabled from the
   TRILL campus. On the other hand, when an RBridge receives an LSP with
   size greater than its local Sz or the campus-wide Sz, this LSP should
   be normally processed rather than discarded. If the size of an LSP is
   larger than the MTU size of a port over which it is to be propagated,
   no attempt shall be made to propagate this LSP over the port and an
   LSPTooLargeToPropagate alarm shall be generated [ISO10589].

3.5. LSP Synchronization

   The DRB of a LAN link is elected as early as in the "Detect" state of
   an adjacency. The DRB begins to send out CSNP to synchronize the LSP
   database of the RBridges attached to this LAN link when the adjacency
   between this RBridge and the DRB moves to 2-way state. If a non-DRB
   RBridge receives this CSNP and finds that LSPx is not in its LSP
   database, it will send out PSNP to request LSPx from the DRB. If a
   non-DRB receives this CSNP and finds that LSPx is not in the LSP
   database of the DRB, it will also send out LSPx to the DRB. 

   DRB and non-DRB on a link should start to synchronize LSP database

   using CSNPs and PSNPs with a neighbor when the adjacency between them
   moves to the 2-way state [RBclr]. The CSNPs and PSNPs should be
   formatted in chunks of size at most the link-wide Lz. Since the link
   MTU size has not been tested in the 2-way state, link-wide Lz may be
   greater than the prospective tested link MTU size. In that case, an
   CSNP or PSNP may be discarded if its size is greater than the
   prospective tested link MTU size. After the link MTU size is
   successfully tested, the adjacencies will begin to format these PDUs
   in the size no greater than it, therefore these PDUs will finally
   successfully get through. 

4. Determining Traffic Link MTU Size

   Campus-wide Sz and link-wide Lz are used to confine the size of TRILL
   IS-IS PDUs. They are different from the MTU size restricting the size
   of TRILL data frames. The size of TRILL data frames is restricted by
   the physical links and devices. It is possible that a TRILL data
   frame successfully get through the campus but its size is greater
   than the campus-wide Sz or link-wide Lz. 

   The algorithm defined in link MTU size testing can also be used in
   TRILL traffic MTU size testing, only that the link-wide Lz used in
   that algorithm should be replaced with the port MTU of the RBridge
   sending MTU probes. The successfully tested size X can be advertised
   as an attribute of this link using MTU sub-TLV defined in [RBisisb]. 

   Unlike RBridges, end stations do not participate the exchange of ISIS
   PDUs of TRILL, therefore they can not grasp the link traffic MTU size
   from a TRILL campus automatically. An operator may collect these
   values using network management tools such as TRILL ping or
   TraceRoute. Then the path MTU is set as the smallest tested link MTU
   on this path and end stations should not generate native frames that
   may exceed this path MTU.

5. Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues for IS-IS.

6. IANA Considerations

   The Lz value of an IS is included in PORT-TRILL-VER sub-TLV as
   originatingSNPBufferSize and sent in IIH (TBD) [RBisisb]. If
   originatingSNPBufferSize is missing from an IIH, it is assumed that
   its originating IS is implicitly advertising its Lz value as 1470
   octets.
