     Mitigating Neighbor Discovery Based Denial of Service Attacks
                 draft-halpern-6man-nddos-mitigation-00

Abstract

   It has been observed that with the large space of IPv6 addresses
   within a subnet, remote attackers can send packets that saturate a
   rotuers ND cache, and potentially saturate a subnet with ND
   Soliciation messages as well.  Some operational techniques and small
   protocol adjustments have been proposed that can help alleviate this
   problem.  This draft proposes a slightly more drastic optional
   behavior for routers, which can nearly eliminate this problem.

Internet-Draft       Mitigating ND Based DoS Attacks        October 2011


1.  Introduction

   It has been observed that with the large space of IPv6 addresses
   within a subnet, remote attackers can send packets that saturate a
   routers ND cache, and potentially saturate a subnet with ND
   Soliciation messages as well.  A thorough description of the problem
   can be found in [ndproblem].  Some operational techniques and small
   protocol adjustments have been proposed that can help alleviate this
   problem are described in [ndenhance].  This draft proposes a slightly
   more drastic optional behavior for routers, which can nearly
   eliminate this problem.

   While the basic behavior described here can be looked upon as a local
   matter, there are robustness issues if a router applies this solution
   on its own.  Therefore, additional enhancements to the basic ND
   protocol behavior as defined in [RFC4861] are specified in this
   document.


2.  Terminology

   The terminology here follows that defined in [RFC4861]

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   HOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Problem Summary and Solution Approach

   The basic problem under discussion is the ability for a remote
   attacker to fill a routers neighbor cache with unresolved, and
   unresolvable, entries.  If done at a sufficient rate, this may
   prevent the router from maintaining the necessaary entries for
   actually reaching the hosts on a subnet the router directly serves.
   Depending upon circumstances, the rate of Neighbor Soliciations
   messages on the subnet may be high enough to casue difficulties,
   since these are multicast messages.

   An attacker causes this problem by sending IPv6 datagrams addressed
   to distinct hypothetical nonexistant host systems on the subnet. the
   attacker sends these messages continusously.  The router receives
   these messasges, and as specified in [RFC4861] it generates Neighbor
   solicitation emssages for each unknown destination, and creates
   INCOMPLETE Neighbor cache entries for each one.  The attacker can use
   random destination addresses, or even sequential addresses and count
   on passing the actual hosts quickly.  With IPv4, this problem could
   be coped with in most cases by simply having a table large enough for

   all the values in the subnet.  With IPv6, which reommends subnets be
   /64s, such sizing is no longer possible.

   This proposals asks the question, what if the router never accepts
   packets for unknown hosts on local subnets?  In such a case, it would
   never create INCOMPLETE cache entries, and would never generate
   Neighbor Solicitation messages based upon received traffic.  Instead
   of soliciating such information, the router would learn of the hosts
   (and neighboring routers) on the subnet from received information.


4.  Basic Behavior

   The basic operational model for the router is still that it maintains
   a neighbor cache with IPv6->Media address resolution information.  It
   populates this cache upon receiving Rotuer Solicitation or Neighbor
   Advertisement messages from hosts on the subnet.

   It is still important thaat the router be able to tell whether hosts
   are still reachable.  As such, routers should assign lifetime
   information to this ifnormation.  As the lifetime approaches, rather
   than discarding the information, the rotuer can issue a Neighbor
   Soliciation message to revalidate the information.  In the absence of
   a response, such revalidaiton should be attempted several times.  On
   links were power consumption is a significant issue, it may make
   sense to simply keep the neighbor cache information without
   expiration or revalidation.


5.  Protocol Enhancements

   While the above description prevents the attack of concern, it has
   several failure modes.  In particular, if a rotuer comes up after a
   subnet is operational, it will not learn the necessary information.
   Also, it would seem desirable to provide additional robustness in the
   learning process, in case too many messages get lost.

   There are three protocol enhancements that can be used to help this
   problem.  The first mechanism, which has also been proposed for other
   reasosn, is simply for all hosts on the subnet to keep sending Router
   Solicitation messages, rather than ceasing after only three
   transmissions.  The rate of sending could be reduced.  The message
   load on the subnet would not be excessive.  One might want to adjust
   the router response to such messages, allowing the router to simply
   maintain the steady rate of advertisement.  This would ensure the
   router learned of all the hosts on the network in a reasoanble time
   even if there were unexpected behaviors (partition repair at the link
   level, for example) which would otherwise interfere.

   As a variation on the above, one could deefine a "please respond"
   flag in the Router Advertisement, whcih the routers could set
   tointermittently to refresh information.  As the repeated Router
   Solicitiations address other issues as well, that seems preferred.

   While the above enhancement would be sufficient to ensure robustness,
   it is desirable to be able to deploy this solution before all the
   hsots on the subnet are upgraded to exhibit that behavior.  As such,
   other robustness techniques are recommended.  These approaches rely
   on the fact that the primary problem occurs when a new router joins
   an active subnet with an already active serving router providing the
   same prefix the new router would provide.

   One thing the existing router could do, which would provided the
   needed robustness, is to cause all the hsots it knows about to send
   new Neighbor Advertisements.  It can do this by sending each host a
   Neghbor soliciation with a source address of the unspecified address.
   This will cause the host to multicast the Neghbor Advertisement it
   responds with.

   One may consider that the message exchanges of such a triggering and
   responding sequence is excessive.  As a fall-back, one could easily
   define an exchange protocol by which an operational router on the
   subnet could send its neighbor cache to the new router.  As this is
   more complex, more detailed work on that is deferred until it is
   deemed necessary.


6.  IANA Considerations

   There are currently no IANA considerations or assignments in this
   document.


7.  Security Considerations

   There are presumably security implications of this behavioral change,
   but they have not been evaluated yet.
