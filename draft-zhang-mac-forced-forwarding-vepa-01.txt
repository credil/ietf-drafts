             MAC-Forced Forwarding Inter-operates with VEPA
             draft-zhang-mac-forced-forwarding-vepa-01.txt

Abstract

   If MAC Forced Forwarding (RFC4562) is enabled on Top Of Rack
   switches, ARPing messages exchanged within a Customer Premises
   Network should be discarded. However, when Virtual Ethernet Port
   Aggregator is deployed in the Customer Premises Network, this kind of
   discarding may disconnect VMs within the same subnet. This document
   suggests interfaces should be differentiated to address this problem.

INTERNET-DRAFT        MAC-Forced Forwarding & VEPA      October 22, 2012


1. Introduction

   MAC Forced Forwarding (MFF) is specified in RFC 4562. According to
   it, MFF does not reply an ARP request destined to a VM located in the
   same Customer Premises Network (CPN) since it is assumed that this
   ARP request should have been replied within the CPN. However, this
   mechanism does not work any more when Virtual Ethernet Port
   Aggregator (VEPA) is deployed in this CPN.

   According to 802.1Qbg, when VEPA is used on servers, upstream frames
   via the same interface may come from different customers or different
   subnet from a same customer. All ARPing messages will be output to
   the external switch (i.e., the Ethernet Access Node as specified in
   RFC 4562. It corresponds to the Top Of Rack switches in Data Center
   Networks) via this interface. The ARP request should also be replied
   by the ARP proxy of this external switch, or else VMs attached to
   this VEPA will be disconnected.

   This document introduces 'isolated user interfaces' for VEPA. ARP
   request received via this kind of interface SHOULD NOT be discarded.
   The Ethernet Access Node's (EAN) ARP proxy MUST reply to it with the
   MAC address of the target Access Router (AR).

1.1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2. Terminology

   ARP: Address Resolution Protocol
   VM: Virtual Machine
   VEPA: Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator
   MFF: The MAC Forced Forwarding technique provided in RFC 4562
   CPN: Customer Premises Network
   EAN: Ethernet Access Node
   AR: Access Router

2. Customer Premises Networks Deploy VEPA

   A Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator (VEPA) outputs switching traffic
   to external switches and external switches provide layer 2
   connectivity for VMs. Customer Premises Networks may deploy VEPA
   therefore the Access Control List, Quality of Service, security and
   filtering, etc, can be executed on the external switch. This kind of
   offloading also frees up servers' resources consumed by switching
   functions.

          Figure 2.1: VEPA is deployed on the subscriber line.

2.1. Intercommunication Between Customers

   When an ARP request is sent to query a MAC address of a VM located in
   a different CPN, the EAN's ARP proxy will reply the request with the
   MAC address of an AR [RFC4562].

   When VEPA is deployed on Customer Premises servers, multiple CPNs may
   share the same subscribe line to communicate with each other
   [802.1Qbg]. Therefore an ARP request may need be answered by a VM
   from another CPN connected by the same subscribe line.  

   According to RFC 4562, EANs never answer an ARP request message via
   the same interface where it is received. MFF takes it for granted
   that the ARP request for a VM connected by the same subscribe line
   should have been answered by the target host. Therefore, the EAN will
   discard the ARPing messages directly thus these VMs will be
   disconnected.

   In Figure 2.1, the subscriber line attached to interface (2) faces
   the above problem.

2.2. VMs from the Same Customer

   Without VEPA, an ARP request to a target VM located in the same CPN
   is assumed to be directly answered by this VM. Therefore the attached
   EAN SHOULD discard this ARP request [RFC4562]. 

   However, when VEPA is deployed, the ARP request will not be answered
   within the CPN. VEPA will output the ARPing to the external switch.
   If the EAN discard the ARPing messages received from the subscriber
   line, VMs of this CPN will be disconnected.

   In Figure 2.1, the subscriber line attached to interface (7) faces
   the above problem.

3. Interface Classification

   According to the analysis in Section 2, whether an ARP request from a
   subscriber line should be answered by the ARP proxy depends on
   whether VEPA is used on this line. Interfaces connected to subscriber
   lines are distinguished to address this difference in this section.

3.1. Network Interface

   The interface where an EAN is connected to ARs is called the 'network
   interface'.

   In Figure 2.1, interface (1) (3) (6) are network interfaces.

3.2. Normal User Interface

   By default, the interface attached to a subscriber line will be set
   to be a 'normal user interface'. Legacy MAC Forced Forwarding rules
   apply to this kind of interfaces.

   In Figure 2.1, interfaces (4) and (5) are normal user interfaces.

3.3. Isolated User Interface

   When VEPA is used on a subscriber line, the interface SHOULD be set
   to be an 'isolated user interface'. EANs MUST use ARP proxy to reply
   ARP requests received on this kind of interfaces.

   In Figure 2.1, interfaces (2) and (7) are isolated user interfaces.

4. Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues.
