Abstract

   Key RFCs for internationalized email addresses specify the basic
   protocols for using them.  The SMTP client can only know the SMTP
   server's ability by EHLO command.  In order to help the
   internationalized email address delivery, this document suggests to
   add the new DNS RR type for internationalized email protocols.
   Through this RR type, the SMTP client can know whether the
   destination SMTP server can support the SMTPUTF8 ability before
   sending the EHLO command to the server.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF key RFCs [RFC6530] [RFC6531] [RFC6532] [RFC6533] provide the
   basis of internationalized email addresses. internationalized email
   Protocols are used to exchange the message between at least two
   SMTPUTF8-aware SMTP servers.  If only one SMTP server supports the
   internationalized email protocols, then internationalized email
   SHOULD not be used.  It is not possible to support internationalized
   email protocol within one night.  It is clear that one
   internationalized email user sends the message to one
   internationalized email user or one ASCII user.  The situation is a
   little complex when one internationalized email user sends the multi-
   users who the Message Submission Agent (MSA)[RFC6409] cannot know
   whether the destination SMTP server can support the SMTPUTF8 ability
   before sending the EHLO command to the server.  On the other hand, we
   cannot judge the SMTPUTF8 ability just according to the email address
   itself.  Even if an destination email address is all-ASCII, it still
   has the possibility that the destination server is SMTPUTF8-aware.
   If an internationalized email user sends the message to both
   internationalized email users and ASCII users, a MSA can deal it with
   its own way based on [RFC6531].  The MSA may choose the following
   strategy: if all recipients are internationalized email users, it
   will use SMTPUTF8 ability to send the message; if one of the
   recipients is the ASCII user, it may choose the rejection of the
   message or other ways.  For example, if an internationalized message
   is sent to 10 users one of which is an ASCII user, the MSA may have
   to say EHLO 10 times before deciding to reject the message.  This
   procedure of judging whether the SMTP server is SMTPUTF8-aware is
   time-consuming.  In order to help the internationalized email address
   delivery and save time, this document suggests to add the new DNS RR
   type for internationalized email protocols.  Through this RR type,
   the SMTP client can know whether the destination SMTP server can
   support the SMTPUTF8 ability before sending the EHLO command to the
   server.

1.1.  Terminology

   All the specialized terms used in this specification are defined in
   the framework document [RFC6530], the internationalized email SMTP
   extension document [RFC6531], the internationalized email header
   document [RFC6532] and the base Internet email specifications
   [RFC5321] [RFC5322], and the basic DNS protocols [RFC1035].


2.  The SMTPUTF8 Resource Record

2.1.  Format

   The SMTPUTF8 RR has mnemonic SMTPUTF8 and type code xx (decimal).  It
   is not class-sensitive.  Its RDATA is comprised of a single field,
   <target>.  The <target> field MUST be present.  The value of <target>
   is that domain names [RFC1035] separated by semicolon or the value is
   "all" or "no".  If the value is the domain names, it means that the
   hosts represented by the domain names are SMTPUTF8-aware.  If the
   value is "all", it means that all the hosts pointed by the owner
   domain name MX records are SMTPUTF8-aware.  If the value is "no", it
   means that all the hosts pointed by the owner domain name MX records
   are not SMTPUTF8-aware.  The wildcards in the SMTPUTF8 RR SHOULD NOT
   be used.

     <owner> <ttl> <class> SMTPUTF8 <target>

   The SMTPUTF8 RR indicates that whether the domain represented by the
   owner of the SMTPUTF8 RR is SMTPUTF8-aware or not.

2.2.  The usage of SMTPUTF8 RR

   All SMTPUTF8-aware SMTP servers should be configured with the
   SMTPUTF8 RR.  The SMTPUTF8-aware SMTP client or MSA should check the
   SMTPUTF8 type before sending the internationalized message to the
   multi-users.  If there is no SMTPUTF8 RR configured for the specific
   domain, the SMTP client should regard that domain as SMTPUTF8-unware.
   If the SMTPUTF8 RR is configured for the specific domain, the SMTP
   client should act based on the value of SMTPUTF8 RR.

2.3.  Discussion

   [[anchor4: This topic is for WG discussion.  If a new DNS type is not
   suggested, a TXT record with the special target value may be used.
   (The mechanism follows the dkim example.)]]


3.  IANA Considerations

   The type code xx should be assigned by IANA.


4.  Security Considerations

   See the extended security considerations discussion in the framework
   document [RFC6530].

   The administrators of email systems should configure this new DNS RR
   type while configuring their internationalized email service.  The

   SMTP client can know the server's ability before saying EHLO.  There
   may have some mis-configurations.  For example, althoug the SMTPUTF8
   RR is not configured, but the server indeed supports the SMTPUTF8.
   Under this situation, the client may refuse to send the
   internationalized message.
