           Neighbor Discovery Enhancement for DOS mititgation
                  draft-gashinsky-6man-v6nd-enhance-01

Abstract

   In IPv4, subnets are generally small, made just large enough to cover
   the actual number of machines on the subnet.  In contrast, the
   default IPv6 subnet size is a /64, a number so large it covers
   trillions of addresses, the overwhelming number of which will be
   unassigned.  Consequently, simplistic implementations of Neighbor
   Discovery can be vulnerable to denial of service attacks whereby they
   attempt to perform address resolution for large numbers of unassigned
   addresses.  Such denial of attacks can be launched intentionally (by
   an attacker), or result from legitimate operational tools that scan
   networks for inventory and other purposes.  As a result of these
   vulnerabilities, new devices may not be able to "join" a network, it
   may be impossible to establish new IPv6 flows, and existing IPv6
   transported flows may be interrupted.

   This document describes a modification to the [RFC4861] neighbor
   discovery protocol aimed at improving the resilience of the neighbor
   discovery process.  We call this process Gratuitous neighbor
   discovery and it derives inspiration in part from analogous IPv4
   gratuitous ARP implementation.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes modifications to the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   protocol [RFC4861] in order to reduce exposure to vulnerabilities
   when a network is scanned, either by an intruder, as part of a
   deliberate DOS attempt, or through the use of scanning tools that
   perform network inventory, security audits, etc. (e.g., "nmap").  In
   some cases, DOS-like conditions can also be induced by legitimate
   traffic in heavy traffic networks such as campuses or datacenters.

1.1.  Applicability

   This document is primarily intended for implementors of [RFC4861].


2.  The Problem

   In IPv4, subnets are generally small, made just large enough to cover
   the actual number of machines on the subnet.  For example, an IPv4
   /20 contains only 4096 address.  In contrast, the default IPv6 subnet
   size is a /64, a number so large it covers literally billions of
   billions of addresses, the overwhelming number of which will be
   unassigned.  Consequently, simplistic implementations of Neighbor
   Discovery can be vulnerable to denial of service attacks whereby they
   perform address resolution for large numbers of unassigned addresses.
   Such denial of attacks can be launched intentionally (by an
   attacker), or result from legitimate operational tools that scan
   networks for inventory and other purposes.  As a result of these
   vulnerabilities, new devices may not be able to "join" a network, it
   may be impossible to establish new IPv6 flows, and existing IPv6
   transport flows may be interrupted.

   Network scans attempt to find and probe devices on a network.
   Typically, scans are performed on a range of target addresses, or all
   the addresses on a particular subnet.  When such probes are directed
   via a router, and the target addresses are on a directly attached
   network, the router will to attempt to perform address resolution on
   a large number of destinations (i.e., some fraction of the 2^64
   addresses on the subnet).  The process of testing for the
   (non)existence of neighbors can induce a denial of service condition,
   where the number of Neighbor Discovery requests overwhelms the
   implementation's capacity to process them, exhausts available memory,
   replaces existing in-use mappings with incomplete entries that will
   never be completed, etc.  The result can be network disruption, where
   existing traffic may be impacted, and devices that join the net find
   that address resolutions fails.

   In some network environments, legitimate Neighbor Discovery traffic



Kumari, et al.           Expires March 23, 2013                 [Page 4]

   from a large number of connected hosts could induce a DoS condition
   even without the use of any scanning tools.  For e.g., Consider a
   campus network with a pair of core routers that aggregate traffic
   from a few thousand wifi clients.  In this scenario, high volume of
   regular ND traffic from clients can easily overwhelm the routers such
   that they are no longer able to process regular traffic anymore.

   In order to alleviate risk associated with this DOS threat, some
   router implementations have taken steps to rate-limit the processing
   rate of Neighbor Solicitations (NS).  While these mitigations do
   help, they do not fully address the issue and may introduce their own
   set of potential liabilities to the neighbor discovery process.

   This document is a companion to two additional documents.  The first
   document was Operational Neighbor Discovery Problems [RFC6583] which
   addressed the problem in detail and described operational and
   implementation mitigation within the framework of the Existing
   protocol.  The second related document Neighbor Unreachability
   Detection is too impatient [1] proposes to alter the Neighbor
   unreachability Detection by relaxing rules in an attempt to keep
   devices in the cache.

   In this document we propose alterations that allow the update or
   installation of neighbor entries without the instigation of a full
   [RFC4861] neighbor solicitation.


3.  Terminology

   Address Resolution  Address resolution is the process through which a
      node determines the link-layer address of a neighbor given only
      its IP address.  In IPv6, address resolution is performed as part
      of Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861], p60

   Forwarding Plane  That part of a router responsible for forwarding
      packets.  In higher-end routers, the forwarding plane is typically
      implemented in specialized hardware optimized for performance.
      Forwarding steps include determining the correct outgoing
      interface for a packet, decrementing its Time To Live (TTL),
      verifying and updating the checksum, placing the correct link-
      layer header on the packet, and forwarding it.

   Control Plane  That part of the router implementation that maintains
      the data structures that determine where packets should be
      forwarded.  The control plane is typically implemented as a
      "slower" software process running on a general purpose processor
      and is responsible for such functions as the routing protocols,
      performing management and resolving the correct link-layer address



Kumari, et al.           Expires March 23, 2013                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 ND Enhance                 September 2012


      for adjacent neighbors.  The control plane "controls" the
      forwarding plane by programming it with the information needed for
      packet forwarding.

   Neighbor Cache  As described in [RFC4861], the data structure that
      holds the cache of (amongst other things) IP address to link-layer
      address mappings for connected nodes.  The forwarding plane
      accesses the Neighbor Cache on every forwarded packet.  Thus it is
      usually implemented in an ASIC .

   Neighbor Discovery Process  The Neighbor Discovery Process (NDP) is
      that part of the control plane that implements the Neighbor
      Discovery protocol.  NDP is responsible for performing address
      resolution and maintaining the Neighbor Cache.  When forwarding
      packets, the forwarding plane accesses entries within the Neighbor
      Cache.  Whenever the forwarding plane processes a packet for which
      the corresponding Neighbor Cache Entry is missing or incomplete,
      it notifies NDP to take appropriate action (typically via a shared
      queue).  NDP picks up requests from the shared queue and performs
      any necessary actions.  In many implementations it is also
      responsible for responding to router solicitation messages,
      Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD), etc.


4.  Background

   Modern router architectures separate the forwarding of packets
   (forwarding plane) from the decisions needed to decide where the
   packets should go (control plane).  In order to deal with the high
   number of packets per second the forwarding plane is generally
   implemented in hardware and is highly optimized for the task of
   forwarding packets.  In contrast, the NDP control plane is mostly
   implemented in software processes running on a general purpose
   processor.

   When a router needs to forward an IP packet, the forwarding plane
   logic performs the longest match lookup to determine where to send
   the packet and what outgoing interface to use.  To deliver the packet
   to an adjacent node, It encapsulates the packet in a link-layer frame
   (which contains a header with the link-layer destination address).
   The forwarding plane logic checks the Neighbor Cache to see if it
   already has a suitable link-layer destination, and if not, places the
   request for the required information into a queue, and signals the
   control plane (i.e., NDP) that it needs the link-layer address
   resolved.

   In order to protect NDP specifically and the control plane generally
   from being overwhelmed with these requests, appropriate steps must be

   taken.  For example, the size and rate of the queue might be limited.
   NDP running in the control plane of the router dequeues requests and
   performs the address resolution function (by performing a neighbor
   solicitation and listening for a neighbor advertisement).  This
   process is usually also responsible for other activities needed to
   maintain link-layer information, such as Neighbor Unreachability
   Detection (NUD).

   An attacker sending the appropriate packets to addresses on a given
   subnet can cause the router to queue attempts to resolve so many
   addresses that it crowds out attempts to resolve "legitimate"
   addresses (and in many cases becomes unable to perform maintenance of
   existing entries in the neighbor cache, and unable to answer Neighbor
   Solicitiation).  This condition can result the inability to resolve
   new neighbors and loss of reachability to neighbors with existing ND-
   Cache entries.  During testing it was concluded that 4 simultaneous
   nmap sessions from a low-end computer was sufficient to make a
   router's neighbor discovery process unhappy and therefore forwarding
   unusable.

   This behavior has been observed across multiple platforms and
   implementations.


5.  Neighbor Discovery Overview

   When a packet arrives at (or is generated by) a router for a
   destination on an attached link, the router needs to determine the
   correct link-layer address to send the packet to.  The router checks
   the Neighbor Cache for an existing Neighbor Cache Entry for the
   neighbor, and if none exists, invokes the address resolution portions
   of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] protocol to determine the
   link-layer address.

   RFC4861 Section 5.2 (Conceptual Sending Algorithm) outlines how this
   process works.  A very high level summary is that the device creates
   a new Neighbor Cache Entry for the neighbor, sets the state to
   INCOMPLETE, queues the packet and initiates the actual address
   resolution process.  The device then sends out one or more Neighbor
   Solicitations, and when it receives a corresponding Neighbor
   Advertisement, completes the Neighbor Cache Entry and sends the
   queued packet.


6.  NDP Protocol Gratuitous NA

   RFC 4861, section 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 [RFC4861] requires that unsolicited
   neighbor advertisements result in the receiver setting it's neighbor

   cache entry to STALE, kicking off the resolution of the neighbor
   using neighbor solicitation.  If the link layer address in an
   unsolicited neighbor advertisement matches that of the existing ND
   cache entry, routers SHOULD retain the existing entry updating it's
   status with regards to LRU retention policy.

   Hosts MAY be configured to send unsolicited Neighbor advertisement at
   a rate set at the discretion of the operators.  The rate SHOULD be
   appropriate to the sizing of ND cache parameters and the host count
   on the subnet.  An unsolicited NA rate parameter MUST NOT be enabled
   by default.  The unsolicited rate interval as interpreted by hosts
   must jitter the value for the interval between transmissions.  Hosts
   receiving a neighbor solicitation requests from a router following
   each of three subsequent gratuitous NA intervals MUST revert to RFC
   4861 behavior.

   Implementation of new behavior for unsolicited neighbor advertisement
   would make it possible under appropriate circumstances to greatly
   reduce the dependence on the neighbor solicitation process for
   retaining existing ND cache entries.

   This may impact the detection of one-way reachability.


7.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA resources or consideration are requested in this draft.


8.  Security Considerations

   This technique has potential impact on neighbor detection and in
   particular the discovery of unidirectional forwarding problems.
