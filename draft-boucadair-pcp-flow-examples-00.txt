Internet-Draft              PCP Flow Examples              February 2013


1.  Introduction

   As a companion document to [I-D.ietf-pcp-base], this document
   provides examples to help understanding the PCP machinery and
   exchanged PCP messages in various usage contexts.

   For more details about PCP protocol specification, the reader is
   invited to refer to [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].

   Examples included in this document make use of the IPv4 and IPv6
   address blocks for documentation purposes defined in [RFC5737] and
   [RFC3849].


2.  Basic MAP Operations

   The following figure illustrates the messages which are exchanged to
   create a mapping in a PCP-controlled device with MAP OpCode.

                  Figure 1: Example of creating a mapping

   The following sub-sections provide several examples depending on the
   content of the MAP request and the decision of the PCP Server.

2.1.  Suggested External Port Honored by the PCP Server

   This example illustrates the content of exchanged PCP messages when
   the PCP Client does not include any PCP Option in its request.  In
   this example, the PCP Server assigns the suggested port number.  In
   reference to Figure 1, the content of exchanged PCP messages is as
   follows:

   Figure 12 shows a PCP Server with a pool of public IPv4 addresses
   (192.0.2/24) and two PCP Clients associated with different
   subscribers.  The PCP Clients each make a port mapping request to the
   PCP Server which creates the mapping from its 192.0.2/24 pool.

   addresses as illustrated in the content of the PCP messages listed
   below.

   The content of PCP messages exchanged between PCP Client 1 and the
   PCP Server is as follows:

2.7.  Mapping Nonce Doesn't Match

   This example illustrates the content of exchanged PCP messages when
   the PCP Client does not include any PCP Option in its request.  In
   this example, the PCP Client indicates a distinct Mapping Nonce than
   the one stored by the PCP Server.  In reference to Figure 1, the
   content of exchanged PCP messages is as follows:

2.8.  PREFERE_FAILURE Option: Requested Port is Honored

   This flow shows an example of the content of PCP messages that will
   be exchanged to create a mapping in a PCP-controlled device.  In this
   example, the PCP Client indicates a requested external UDP port
   number and also a PREFERE_FAILURE Option.  In this example, we
   suppose the requested port can be honored by the PCP Server.  In
   reference to Figure 1, the content of exchanged PCP messages is as
   follows:

2.9.  PREFERE_FAILURE Option: Requested Port is not Honored

   This flow shows an example of the content of PCP messages that will
   be exchanged to create a mapping in a PCP-controlled device.  In this
   example, the PCP Client indicates a requested external UDP port
   number and also a PREFERE_FAILURE Option.  In this example, we
   suppose the requested port cannot be honored by the PCP Server.  In
   reference to Figure 1, the content of exchanged PCP messages is as

2.10.  Existing Implicit Mapping

   This example illustrates the content of exchanged PCP messages when
   the PCP Client requests a mapping which matches an existing implicit
   dynamic mapping (see Figure 23).  In this example, the PCP-Controlled
   device assigns 10000 as external port number when translating the
   packet from the client having with source port set to 1234.

   Suppose the client has instructed a UDP mapping for port 3938
   (assigned external port is 15000 and assigned external IPv4 address
   is: 192.0.2.1).  Upon a change of a state: e.g., change of the
   external IP Address, the PCP Server issues an unsolicited MAP
   response.  The content of the MAP response sent by the PCP Server is
   shown below.  The PCP Client is now aware of the new assigned
   external IP address.

3.  NAT Detect Example

   Let us suppose a PCP-unaware NAT is located between the PCP Server
   and the PCP Client.  An example of PCP MAP request issued by the PCP
   Client is shown below.

   Version: 2
   R bit: Request (0)
   Opcode: MAP (0x01)
   Requested Lifetime: 36000 sec
   PCP Client's IP Address: ::ffff:198.51.100.1
   MAP Request:
    Mapping Nonce: 15685
    Protocol: UDP (17)

    Assigned External IP Address: ::ffff:0.0.0.0

                    Figure 39: MAP request (NAT Detect)

   This message will be translated by the PCP-unaware NAT.  The source
   IP address if the resulting message will be another address than
   198.51.100.1.  Upon receipt of this message, the PCP Server compares
   the source IP address and the content of PCP Client's IP Address
   field.  Because the two addresses are not equal, the PCP Server
   concludes there is PCP-unaware device in the path.  As a result, the
   PCP Server will issue the following error message:

4.  Retrieve the External IP Address

   In order to retrieve the IP address used on the external side of the
   PCP-controlled device, the PCP Client sends a short-lived mapping
   (e.g., Discard service (TCP/9 or UDP/9) or other port).  The returned
   IP address can be displayed by any application requiring such
   information.

5.1.  THIRD_PARTY Enabled at the Server Side

   The following messages are exchanged when the THIRD_PARTY option is
   enabled in the PCP Server side.  In this example the PCP Client
   creates a mapping for the host assigned with 198.51.100.2.

7.  Assess the Reachability of the PCP Server

   In this example, the PCP Client issues a PCP ANNOUNCE request to an
   IP address of a PCP Server.  Once received by the PCP Server, since
   it is configured to reply to such request, it sends back a PCP
   ANNOUNCE response.  This procedure can be used to retrieve the Epoch
   time.

8.5.  Learn the Lifetime of a Mapping

   In reference to Figure 64, the content of exchanged PEER messages to
   learn the lifetime of a mapping is shown below:

   Version: 2
   R bit: Request (0)
   Opcode: PEER (0x02)
   Requested Lifetime: 5 sec
   PCP Client's IP Address: ::ffff:198.51.100.1
   PEER Request:
    Mapping Nonce: 15685
    Protocol: TCP (6)
    Internal Port: 3938
    Suggested External Port: 0
    Suggested External IP Address: ::ffff:0.0.0.0
    Remote Peer Port: 12456
    Remote IP Address: ::ffff:198.51.100.2

                          Figure 67: PEER request

   Version: 2
   R bit: Response (1)
   Opcode: PEER (0x02)
   Result Code: 0
   Lifetime: 20000 sec
   Epoch Time: 1250
   PEER Response:
    Mapping Nonce: 15685
    Protocol: TCP (6)
    Internal Port: 3938
    Assigned External Port: 11000
    Assigned External IP Address: ::ffff:192.0.2.1
    Remote Peer Port: 12456
    Remote IP Address: ::ffff:198.51.100.2

9.  Version Negotiation

   Suppose the PCP Client supports PCP version 1 while the PCP Server
   supports PCP version 2.  The following exchange will be observed:
