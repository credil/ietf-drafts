Internet-Draft              apt-X RTP Format                    Mar 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the payload format for packetization of audio
   data, encoded with the Standard apt-X or Enhanced apt-X audio coding
   algorithms, into the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  [RFC3550].

   The document outlines some conventions, a brief description of the
   operating principles of the audio codecs, and the payload format
   capabilities.  The RTP payload format is detailed and a relevant 
   example of the format is provided.  The media type, its mappings to 
   SDP [RFC4566] and its usage in the SDP offer/answer model are also 
   specified.  Finally, some security considerations are outlined.

   This document registers a media type (audio/aptx) for the RTP payload
   format for the Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X audio codecs.

2.  Conventions

   This document uses the normal IETF bit-order representation.  Bit
   fields in figures are read left to right and then down.  The leftmost
   bit in each field is the most significant.  The numbering starts from
   0 and ascends, where bit 0 will be the most significant.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X Codecs

   Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X are proprietary audio coding
   algorithms, licensed by CSR plc and widely deployed in a variety of
   audio processing equipment.  For commercial reasons, the detailed 
   internal operations of these algorithms are not described in 
   standards or reference documents.  However, the data interfaces to 
   implementations of these algorithms are very simple, and allow easy 
   RTP packetization of data coded with the algorithms, without a 
   detailed knowledge of the actual coded audio stream syntax.

   Both the Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X coding algorithms are
   based on Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation principles.
   They produce a constant coded bit rate that is scaled according to  
   the sample frequency of the uncoded audio.  This constant rate is 1/4
   of the bit rate of the uncoded audio, irrespective of the resolution
   (number of bits) used to represent an uncoded audio sample.  For  
   example, a 1.536 Mbit/s stereo audio stream, composed of 2 channels 
   of 16-bit Pulse Code Modulated (PCM) audio that is sampled at a 
   frequency of 48 kHz, is encoded at 384 kbit/s.

   Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X do not enforce a coded frame 
   structure, and the coded data forms a continuous coded sample stream   
   with each coded sample capable of regenerating 4 PCM samples when 
   decoded.  The Standard apt-X algorithm encodes 4 successive 16-bit 
   PCM samples from each audio channel into a single 16-bit coded sample
   per audio channel.  The Enhanced apt-X algorithm encodes 4 successive
   16-bit or 24-bit PCM samples from each audio channel and respectively
   produces a single 16-bit or 24-bit coded sample per channel.  The 
   same RTP packetisation rules apply for each of these algorithmic 
   variations.  

.  Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X coded data streams can optionally 
   carry synchronisation information and an auxiliary data channel  
   within the coded audio data without additional overhead.  These 
   mechanisms can, for instance, be used when the IP system is cascaded 
   with another transportation system and the decoder is acting as a 
   simple bridge between the two systems.  Since auxiliary data channel 
   and synchronisation information are carried within the coded audio 
   data without additional overhead, RTP payload format rules do not 
   change if they are present.  Out-of-band signalling is required 
   however to notify the receiver end when autosync and auxiliary data 
   have been embedded in the apt-X stream. 

   Embedded auxiliary data is typically used to transport non-audio 
   data, and timecode information for synchronisation with video.  The 
   bit rate of the auxiliary data channel is 1/4 of the sample 
   frequency.  For example with a single audio channel encoded at Fs = 
   48kHz, an auxiliary data bit rate of 12 kbit/s can be embedded.

   apt-X further provides a means of stereo pairing apt-X channels so 
   that the embedded autosync and auxiliary data channel can be shared 
   across the channel pair. In the case of a 1.536 Mbit/s stereo audio 
   stream, composed of 2 channels of 16-bit PCM audio that is sampled 
   at 48 kHz, a byte of auxiliary data would typically be fed into the 
   Standard or Enhanced apt-X encoder once every 32 uncoded left 
   channel samples.  By default apt-X channels pairing is not enabled. 
   Out-of-band signalling is required to notify the receiver when the 
   option is being used. 

   Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X decoders that have not be set up 
   with the correct embedded autosync, auxiliary data and stereo pairing
   information will playout uncoded PCM samples with a loss of decoding 
   quality. In the case of standard apt-X the loss of quality can be 
   significant.

4.  Payload Format Capabilities

   This RTP payload format carries an integer number of Standard apt-X
   or Enhanced apt-X coded audio samples.  When multiple related audio
   channels are being conveyed within the payload, each channel
   contributes the same integer number of apt-X coded audio samples to
   the total carried by the payload.

4.1.  Use of Forward Error Correction (FEC)

   Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X do not inherently provide any 
   mechanism for adding redundancy or error-control coding into the 
   coded audio stream.  Generic forward error correction schemes for RTP
   such as RFC 2198 [RFC2198] and RFC 5109 [RFC5109] can be used to add 
   redundant information to Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X RTP packet
   streams, making them more resilient to packet losses at the expense 
   of a higher bit rate.

5.  Payload Format

   The Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X algorithms encode 4 successive
   PCM samples from each audio channel and produce a single compressed
   sample for each audio channel.  The encoder MUST be presented with
   an integer number S of input audio samples, where S is an arbitrary
   multiple of 4.  The encoder will produce exactly S/4 coded audio
   samples.  Since each coded audio sample is either 16 or 24 bits, the
   amount of coded audio data produced upon each invocation of the
   encoding process will be an integer number of bytes.  RTP
   packetization of the encoded data SHALL be on a byte-by-byte basis.

5.1.  RTP Header Usage

   Utilisation of the Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X coding
   algorithms does not create any special requirements with respect to
   the contents of the RTP packet header.  Other RTP packet header 
   fields are defined as follows.

   o  V - As per [RFC3550]

   o  P - As per [RFC3550]

   o  X - As per [RFC3550]

   o  CC - As per [RFC3550]

   o  M - This payload format defines no use for this bit. Senders
      SHOULD set this bit to zero in each outgoing packet. 

   o  PT - A dynamic payload type, i.e. one within the range [96..127],
      MUST be used. [RFC3551]

   o  SN - As per [RFC3550]

   o  Timestamp - As per [RFC3550]. The RTP timestamp reflects the 
      instant at which the first audio sample in the packet was sampled,
      that is, the oldest information in the packet. 

   Header field abbreviations are defined as follows.

      V - Version Number

      P - Padding

      X - Extensions

      CC - Count of contributing sources

5.2.   Payload Structure

   The RTP payload data for Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X MUST be
   structured as follows.  

   Standard and Enhanced apt-X coded samples are packed contiguously 
   into payload octets in "network byte order", also known as big-endian
   order and starting with the most significant bit.  Coded samples are
   packed into the packet in time sequence beginning with the oldest 
   coded sample. An integer number of coded samples MUST be within the 
   same packet.

   When multiple channels of Standard and E-APTX coded audio, such as 
   in a stereo program, are multiplexed into a single RTP stream, the 
   coded samples from each channel, at a single sampling instant, are 
   interleaved into a coded sample block according to the following  
   standard audio channel ordering, [RFC3551]. Coded sample blocks are 
   then packed into the packet in time sequence beginning with the 
   oldest coded sample block.

   For the two-channel encoding example, the sample sequence is (left
   channel, first sample), (right channel, first sample), (left channel,
   second sample), (right channel, second sample). Coded Samples for all

   channels, belonging to a single coded sampling instant, MUST be 
   contained in the same packet. All channels in the same RTP stream 
   MUST be sampled at the same frequency.  

5.3.   Default Packetization Interval

   The default packetization interval MUST have a duration of 4 ms. 
   When an integer number of coded samples per channel cannot be
   contained within this 4ms interval, the default packet interval MUST
   be rounded down to the nearest packet interval that can contain a 
   complete integer set of coded samples.  For example when encoding 
   audio with either Standard or Enhanced apt-X, sampled at 11025 Hz,
   22050 Hz, or 44100 Hz, the packetization interval MUST be rounded
   down to 3.99 ms. 

   The packetization interval sets limits on the end-to-end delay; 
   shorter packets minimize the audio delay through a system at the 
   expense of increased bandwidth while longer packets introduce 
   less header overhead but increase delay and make packet loss
   more noticeable. A default packet interval of 4 ms maintains an 
   acceptable ratio of payload to header bytes and minimizes 
   the end-to-end delay to allow viable interactive apt-X based 
   applications. All implementations MUST support this default 
   packetization interval.

5.4.  Implementation Considerations

   An application implementing this payload format MUST understand all
   the payload parameters that are defined in this specification.  Any
   mapping of these parameters to a signaling protocol MUST support all
   parameters.  Implementation can always decide whether they are
   capable of communicating based on the entities defined in this 
   specification.

5.5.  Payload Example

   As an example payload format, consider the transmission of an
   arbitrary 5.1 audio signal consisting of 6 channels of 24-bit PCM
   data, sampled at a rate of 48 kHz and packetized on a RTP packet 
   interval of 4ms.  The total bit rate before audio coding is 
   6 * 24 * 48000 = 6.912 Mbits/s.  Applying Enhanced apt-X coding,
   with a coded sample size of 24 bits, results in a transmitted coded 
   bit rate of 1/4 of the uncoded bit rate, i.e. 1.728 Mbit/s. On packet
   intervals of 4 ms, packets contain 864 bytes of encoded data that 
   contain 48 Enhanced apt-X coded samples per channel.

6.  Payload Format Parameters

   This RTP payload format is identified using the media type audio/
   aptx, which is registered in accordance with RFC 4855 [RFC4855] and
   using the template of RFC 4288 [RFC4288]

6.1.  Media Type Definition

   Registration of media subtype audio/aptx.

      MIME media type name: audio

      MIME subtype name: aptx

      Required parameters:

         rate:
         RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the sampling rate
         in Hz.  -- RECOMMENDED values for rate are 8000, 11025, 16000, 
         22050, 24000, 32000, 44100 and 48000 samples per second. Other 
         values are permissible.

         channels:
         The number of logical audio channels that are present in the  
         audio stream.


         variant:
         The variant of apt-X (i.e.  Standard or Enhanced) that is being
         used.  The following variants can be signalled:

            variant=standard
            variant=enhanced

         bitresolution:
         The number of bits used by the algorithm to encode 4 PCM
         samples.  This value MAY only be set to 16 for Standard apt-X
         and 16 or 24 for Enhanced apt-X.


      Optional parameters:

         ptime:
         The recommended length of time (in milliseconds) represented by
         the media in a packet.  Defaults to 4 ms. See Section 6 of 
         [RFC4566].

         maxptime:
         The maximum length of time (in milliseconds) that can be
         encapsulated in a packet.  See Section 6 of [RFC4566].

Internet-Draft              apt-X RTP Format                    Mar 2012


         stereo-channel-pairs:
         Defines audio channels that are stereo paired in the stream. 
         See Section 3.  Each pair of audio channels is defined as two 
         comma-separated values that correspond to channel numbers in 
         the range 1..channels.  Each stereo channel pair is preceded 
         by a '{', and followed by a '}'.  Pairs of audio channels are 
         separated by a comma.  A channel MUST NOT be paired with more
         than one other channel.  Absence of this parameter signals that
         each channel has been independently encoded.
 
 
         embedded-autosync-channels:
         Defines channels that carry embedded autosync.  embedded-
         autosync-channels is defined as a list of comma-separated 
         values that correspond to channel numbers in the range 1..
         channels.  When a channel is stereo paired, embedded autosync
         is shared across channels in the pair. Only the first channel 
         as defined in stereo-channel-pairs MUST be specified in the 
         embedded-autosync-channels list.


         embedded-aux-channels: 
         Defines channels that carry embedded auxiliary data.  embedded-
         aux-channel is defined as a list of comma-separated values 
         that correspond to channel numbers in the range 1..channels.
         When a channel is stereo paired, embedded auxiliary data is 
         shared across channels in the pair. Only the second channel as 
         defined in stereo-channel-pairs MUST be specified in the
         embedded-autosync-channels list.


      Encoding considerations: This type is only defined for transfer
      via RTP [RFC3550].

      Security considerations: See Section 5 of [RFC4855] and Section 4
      of [RFC4856].

      Interoperability considerations: none

      Published specification: RFC XXXX

      Applications which use this media type: Audio streaming

      Additional information: none

6.2.  Mapping to SDP

   The information carried in the media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566] that is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP
   is used to describe sessions the media type mappings are as follows.

      The type name ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

      The subtype name ("aptx") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the encoding
      name.

      The parameter "rate" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as clock rate.

      The parameter "channels" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as channel count.

      The required parameters "variant" and "bitresolution" MUST be
      included in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute and MUST follow the
      delivery-method that applies.

      The optional parameters "stereo-channel-pairs", "embedded-
      autosync-channels", "embedded-aux-channels", and "maxptime" when
      present, MUST be included in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute and MUST
      follow the delivery-method that applies.

      The parameter "ptime", when present, goes in a separate SDP
      attribute field and is signalled as "a=ptime:<value>", where
      <value> is the number of millseconds of audio represented by one
      RTP packet.  See Section 6 of [RFC4566].

6.2.1.  SDP Usage Examples

   Some example SDP session descriptions utilizing apt-X encodings
   follow.  In these examples, long a=fmtp lines are folded to meet the
   column width constraints of this document. 
 
   Example 1: An standard apt-X stream that encodes two independent 
   44.1kHz 16-bit PCM channels into a 4ms RTP packet.
.
      m=audio 5004 RTP/AVP 98
      a=rtpmap:98 aptx/44100/2
      a=fmtp:98 variant=standard; bitresolution=16;
      a=ptime:4

Internet-Draft              apt-X RTP Format                    Mar 2012


   Example 2: An enhanced apt-X stream that encodes two 48kHz 24-bit 
   stereo channels into a 4ms RTP packet and that carries both an 
   embedded autosync and auxiliary data channel.

      m=audio 5004 RTP/AVP 98
      a=rtpmap:98 aptx/48000/2
      a=fmtp:98 variant=enhanced; bitresolution=24;
      stereo-channel-pairs={1,2}; embedded-autosync-channels=1;
      embedded-aux-channels=2

      a=ptime:4

   Example 3: An enhanced apt-X stream that encodes six 44.1kHz 24-bit 
   channels into a 6ms RTP packet. Channels 1,2 and 3,4 are stereo 
   pairs.  Both stereo pairs carry both an embedded autosync and 
   auxiliary data channel.

      m=audio 5004 RTP/AVP 98
      a=rtpmap:98 aptx/44100/6
      a=fmtp:98 variant=enhanced; bitresolution=24;
      stereo-channel-pairs={1,2},{3,4}; embedded-autosync-channels=1,3;
      embedded-aux-channels=2,4
      a=ptime:6



6.2.2.  Offer/Answer Considerations

   The only negotiable parameter is the delivery method.  All other
   parameters are declarative.  The offer, as described in [RFC3264],
   may contain a large number of delivery methods per single fmtp
   attribute, the answerer MUST remove every delivery method and
   configuration uri not supported.  Apart from this exceptional case,
   all parameters MUST NOT be altered on answer.

7.  IANA Considerations

   One media type (audio/aptx) has been defined and needs registration
   in the media types registry.  See Section 7.1

8.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550], and any appropriate RTP profile (for example
   [RFC3551]).  This implies that confidentiality of the media streams
   is achieved by encryption.  Because the audio coding used with this
   payload format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be performed
   after audio coding so there is no conflict between the two
   operations.  A potential denial-of-service threat exists for audio
   coding techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end computational
   load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams into the stream
   which are complex to decode and cause the receiver to be overloaded.
   However, the Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X audio coding
   algorithms do not exhibit any significant non-uniformity.  As with
   any IP-based protocol, in some circumstances a receiver may be
   overloaded simply by the receipt of too many packets, either desired
   or undesired.  Network-layer authentication may be used to discard
   packets from undesired sources, but the processing cost of the
   authentication itself may be too high.  In a multicast environment,
   pruning of specific sources may be implemented in future versions of
   IGMP [RFC3376] and in multicast routing protocols to allow a receiver
   to select which sources are allowed to reach it.
