    <section title="Introduction" anchor='intro'>

      <t>The disclosure process for intellectual property rights (IPR) in IETF stream documents is essential to the accurate and efficient development of consensus by the community.  Ensuring that IETF working groups and participants have as much information as possible regarding IPR constraints, as early as possible in the process, enables the community to develop an informed consensus regarding technical proposals.  Statements to that effect appear in <xref target='RFC1602'/>, Section 5.5 Clause (B), and <xref target='RFC2026'/>, Section 10.4 Clause (B).</t>
      <t>However, IPR disclosures often do not occur at the earliest possible stage in the IETF process.  Individuals might delay disclosure through an oversight, to subvert the consensus process, or to introduce delay.  Regardless of the cause or motivation, noncompliance with IPR disclosure rules can derail or delay completion of standards documents.  Disclosure of IPR after significant decisions, such as Working Group Last Call, might lead to reconsideration of those actions.  For example, a working group (WG) might change course and use a previously rejected technical proposal with less onerous limitations.  Such course corrections produce unnecessary delays in the standardization process.</t>
      <t>This document suggests strategies for promoting compliance with the IPR disclosure rules and thereby avoiding such delays.  The strategies are primarily intended for area directors (ADs), working group chairs, and working group secretaries.</t>
      <t>The strategies are focused on promoting early disclosure by authors, since late disclosure involving authors has historically caused significant delays in the standardization process.  Many of the strategies also promote early disclosure by other contributors.</t>
      <t>This document does not consider the parallel, but important, issue of potential actions that can be taken by the IETF itself for lack of conformance with the IETF's IPR policy.  That topic is discussed in <xref target='Sanctions'/>.</t>

      <section title="Terminology" anchor='intro-terms'>

        <t>This document relies on the definitions provided in section 1 of <xref target='RFC3979'/>.</t>
        <t>By intent, this document does not use the conformance language described in <xref target='RFC2119'/>.</t>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Background" anchor='background'>

      <t>The responsibilities of contributors and IETF participants regarding IPR disclosure are documented in <xref target='RFC3979'/> and <xref target='RFC4879'/>.  These documents do not assign any further responsibilities to working group chairs and area directors, other than those imposed by their roles as contributors or participants.  However, late disclosure of IPR has a direct impact on the effectiveness of working groups, WG chairs, and ADs.</t>
      <t>According to <xref target='RFC2418'/>, working group chairs are responsible for "making forward progress through a fair and open process" and area directors are responsible for "ensuring that working groups in their area produce ... timely output."  IPR disclosure at the earliest possible time is an essential feature of a "fair and open process", and late disclosure impedes timely output through recycling and appeals.</t>
      <t>To better fulfill their responsibilities in the IETF standards process, ADs and WG chairs might wish to adopt strategies to encourage early disclosure consistent with the responsibilities established in <xref target='RFC3979'/> and <xref target='RFC4879'/>, such as the strategies described in this document.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Strategies for Working Group Documents" anchor='wg'>

      <t>Building upon the framework provided in <xref target='RFC3669'/>, this section identifies opportunities to promote IPR disclosure within the document lifecycle for IETF working group documents.  In general, these opportunities are encountered during socialization, working group adoption, Working Group Last Call, and IETF Last Call.  The strategies described in this section are primarily implemented by working group chairs. (The exceptions are strategies for IETF Last Call, which would be implemented by ADs.)  In cases where the working secretary creates meeting agendas or initiates consensus calls, the secretary might also implement these strategies.</t>
      <t>The working group process provides a number of opportunities to encourage early IPR disclosure.  The first opportunities might be presented even before a technical proposal becomes a working group document.</t>
      <t>When IETF participants wish to socialize a personal draft, in hopes of future adoption by a working group, one common strategy is to request agenda time at an upcoming face-to-face meeting.  Before the community commits resources to reviewing and considering the draft, it is very reasonable for the WG chair to confirm (often via email) that all IPR disclosures have been submitted.  The chair ought to request confirmation from each of the authors, especially if authors are from multiple organizations.</t>
      <t>If necessary disclosures have not been submitted, the chair has a choice: insist on an informal disclosure in the presentation, or deny the agenda slot unless the IPR disclosure is submitted.  One factor in this decision could be the number of revisions that have occurred: the chair might wish to permit presentation of a -00 draft with a verbal disclosure, but not after a draft has gone through multiple cycles.</t>
      <t>In some cases, an IETF participant has not developed an Internet-Draft but might still request agenda time to discuss a proposal for a new draft, or a new feature for an existing working group document.  Again, it is very reasonable for the WG chair to confirm that all IPR disclosures have been submitted before approving agenda time, so that the community does not commit resources to analyzing the proposal without knowledge of IPR limitations.</t>
      <t>When a technical proposal is considered for adoption by the working group, the chair might wish to explicitly ask the WG participants if anyone is aware of IPR that is associated with this proposal.  While requiring confirmation from each working group participant is clearly impossible, silence might be interpreted as a weak "No".</t>
      <t>Working Group Last Call is a particularly significant milestone for a working group document, measuring consensus within the working group one final time.  If IPR disclosure statements have not been submitted, the judgement of consensus by the chair would be less than reliable.  Even if the procedures such as those described above have been implemented to promote IPR disclosure during socialization and adoption, features might have evolved in a way that introduces new IPR concerns.  New participants with knowledge of IPR claims might have joined the working group.  Chairs might wish to re-confirm with each of the authors that appropriate IPR disclosure statements have been filed, even if the authors all work for the same organization.  Chairs might also wish to include a reminder about the importance of IPR disclosures in any Last Call message.  (Note: If IPR disclosure statements have been filed, the chair might wish to include a link in the Last Call email message to ensure that the consensus call reflects this information.)</t>
      <t>Working group documents are forwarded to the appropriate Area Director after successfully completing Working Group Last Call.  Area directors  are encouraged determine whether the chairs took explicit action to promote disclosure of IPR.  If the chair did not take any of the actions listed above, the Area Director might choose to contact authors and other key contributors (e.g., those listed in the acknowledgements) to confirm that appropriate IPR disclosure statements have been filed.</t>
      <t>IETF Last Call is the AD's vehicle for gauging IETF-wide consensus.  It is critical that the community have easy access to all related IPR statements when considering an Internet-Draft.  The current tools automatically include the URL for each IPR statement explicitly linked to the draft when the default Last Call message is generated.  If the AD edits this message, the links to IPR disclosure statements ought to be preserved.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Strategies for Individual Submissions" anchor='individual'>

      <t>This section identifies opportunities to promote IPR disclosure within the IETF document lifecycle for documents that are not processed in a working group.  In general, these opportunities are encountered during socialization, area director review, and IETF Last Call.</t>
      <t>When IETF participants wish to socialize a personal draft not intended for a working group, it is still common to request agenda time at an upcoming face-to-face meeting.  These requests might be made to related working groups or area meetings, or even during plenary time.  Before the community commits resources to reviewing and considering the draft, it is very reasonable for the chair of that meeting (WG chair, AD, IESG chair, or IAB chair) to confirm that all IPR disclosures have been submitted.</t>
      <t>The meeting chair ought to request confirmation from each of the authors, especially if authors are from multiple organizations.  Where the presentation covers a concept that has not been documented as an Internet-Draft, the chair ought to request confirmation from any co-authors and from contributors acknowledged in the slide deck.</t>
      <t>When considering the possibility of sponsoring an Internet-Draft, an AD ought to also confirm that all IPR disclosures have been submitted.  The AD ought to require confirmation from each of the authors, even if authors are from the same organization.</t>
      <t>As with working group documents, IETF Last Call is the AD's vehicle for gauging IETF-wide consensus.  It is critical that the community have easy access to all related IPR statements when considering an Internet-Draft.  The current tools automatically include the URL for each IPR statement explicitly linked to the draft when the default Last Call message is generated.  If the AD edits this message, the links to IPR disclosure statements ought to be preserved.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Conclusions" anchor='conclusions'>
    
      <t>WG chairs and ADs are not expected to enforce IPR disclosure rules.  This document is not suggesting that they take on such a role.  However, lack of compliance with IPR disclosure policies can have a significant impact on their effectiveness.  To support the efficient development of IETF standards and avoid unnecessary delays, chairs and ADs are encouraged to look for opportunities to promote awareness and compliance with the IETF's IPR policies.  The strategies in this document promote compliance by raising the question of IPR disclosure at critical junctures in the standardization process.</t>

<date year='2005' month='March' />
<abstract>
<t>The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), such as patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are designed to ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as much information about any IPR constraints on a technical proposal as possible.  The policies are also intended to benefit the Internet community and the public at large, while respecting the legitimate rights of IPR holders.  This memo details the IETF policies concerning IPR related to technology worked on within the IETF.  It also describes the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.  This memo updates RFC 2026 and, with RFC 3978, replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026.  This memo also updates paragraph 4 of Section 3.2 of RFC 2028, for all purposes, including reference [2] in RFC 2418.

<abstract>
<t>This document is a revision of RFC 1310, which defined the official procedures for creating and documenting Internet Standards.</t>
<t>This revision (revision 2) includes the following major changes:</t>
<t>(a)  The new management structure arising from the POISED Working Group is reflected.  These changes were agreed to by the IETF plenary and by the IAB and IESG in November 1992 and accepted by the ISOC Board of Trustees at their December 1992 meeting.</t>
<t>(b)  Prototype status is added to the non-standards track maturity levels (Section 2.4.1).</t>
<t>(c)  The Intellectual Property Rights section is completely revised, in accordance with legal advice.  Section 5 of this document replaces Sections 5 and 6 of RFC-1310.  The new section 5 has been reviewed by legal counsel to the Internet Society.</t>
<t>(d)  An appeals procedure is added (Section 3.6).</t>
<t>(e)  The wording of sections 1 and 1.2 has been changed to clarify the relationships that exist between the Internet Society and the IAB, the IESG, the IETF, and the Internet Standards process.</t>
<t>(f)  An Appendix B has been added, listing the contact points for the RFC editor, the IANA, the IESG, the IAB and the ISOC. The "future issues" are now listed in Appendix C.</t></abstract></front>
