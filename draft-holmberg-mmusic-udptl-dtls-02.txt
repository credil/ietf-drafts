Abstract

   This document specifies how the UDP Transport Layer (UDPTL) protocol
   can be transported over the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   protocol, how the usage of UDPTL over DTLS is indicated in the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP), and how UDPTL over DTLS is
   negotiated in a session established using the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP).

1.  Introduction

   While telephony encryption devices have been traditionally used for
   highly sensitive documents, secure fax on the Public Switched
   Telephone Network (PSTN) was not as widely considered or prioritized
   because of the challenges involved with physical access to telephony
   equipment.  As real-time communications transition to IP networks,
   where information might potentially be intercepted or spoofed, an
   appropriate level of security for fax that offers integrity and
   confidentiality protection is vital.  Some of the security mechanisms
   for securing fax include:

   o  [ITU.T30.2005] Annex H specifies integrity and confidentiality
      protection of fax in application layer, independent of protocol
      for fax transport.
   o  [ITU.T38.2010] specifies fax transport over RTP/SAVP which enables
      integrity and confidentiality protection of fax in IP network.

   Despite these mechanisms to secure fax, there is no transport layer
   security offering integrity and confidentiality protection for UDPTL

                Table 1: Protocol stack for UDPTL over UDP

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has performed a study
   on how to provide secure fax in the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) and
   concluded that secure fax shall be transported using UDPTL over DTLS.

   This document specifies fax transport using UDPTL over DTLS
   [RFC6347], which enables integrity and confidentiality protection of
   fax in IP networks.  The protocol stack for integrity and
   confidentiality protected fax transport using UDPTL over DTLS is
   shown in Table 2.

                Table 2: Protocol stack for UDPTL over UDP

   The primary motivations for the mechanism in this document are:

   o  The design of DTLS [RFC6347] is clearly defined, well understood
      and implementations are widely available.

Internet-Draft               UDPTL over DTLS              September 2013


   o  No DTLS extensions are required in order to enable UDPTL transport
      over DTLS.
   o  Fax transport using UDPTL over DTLS only requires insertion of the
      DTLS layer between the UDPTL layer and the UDP layer, as shown in
      Table 2.  The UDPTL layer and layers above UDPTL layer require no
      modification.
   o  UDPTL [ITU.T38.2010] is by far the most widely deployed fax
      transport protocol in IP networks.
   o  3GPP needs a mechanism to transport UDPTL over DTLS, in order to
      provide secure fax in IMS networks.

   This document specifies the transport of UDPTL over DTLS using the
   DTLS record layer "application_data" packets [RFC6347].

   Since the DTLS record layer "application_data" packet does not
   indicate whether it carries UDPTL, or some other protocol, the usage
   of a dedicated DTLS association for transport of UDPTL needs to be
   negotiated, e.g. using the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566] and the SDP offer/answer mechanism [RFC3264].

   Therefore, this document specifies a new <proto> value [RFC4566] for
   the SDP media description ("m=" line) [RFC3264], in order to indicate
   UDPTL over DTLS in SDP messages [RFC4566].

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   DTLS uses the term "session" to refer to a long-lived set of keying
   material that spans DTLS associations.  In this document, in order to
   be consistent with SIP/SDP usage of "session" terminology, we use it
   to refer to a multimedia session and use the term "DTLS session" to
   refer to the DTLS construct.  We use the term "DTLS association" to
   refer to a particular DTLS cipher suite and keying material set that
   is associated with a single host/port quartet.  The same DTLS session
   can be used to establish the keying material for multiple DTLS
   associations.  For consistency with other SIP/SDP usage, we use the
   term "connection" when what's being referred to is a multimedia
   stream that is not specifically DTLS.

3.  Secure Channel

3.1.  Secure Channel Establishment

   The SDP offer/answer mechanism [RFC3264] is used by other protocols,
   e.g. the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261], to negotiate
   and establish multimedia sessions.

   In addition to the usual contents of an SDP media description ("m="
   line) specified for UDPTL over the UDP, each SDP media description
   for UDPTL over DTLS over the UDP will also contain several SDP
   attributes, as specified in [RFC4145] and [RFC4572].

   The SDP offer and SDP answer MUST conform to the following
   requirements:

   o  The endpoint MUST set the "proto" field of the "m=" line to the
      token specified in Table 3.
   o  The endpoint MUST use the SDP setup attribute [RFC4145].  The
      offerer MUST assign the SDP setup attribute with setup:actpass
      value, and MUST be prepared to receive a DTLS client_hello message
      before it receives the SDP answer.  The answerer MUST assign the
      SDP setup attribute with either setup:active value or
      setup:passive value.  The answerer SHOULD assign the SDP setup
      attribute with the setup:active value.  Whichever party is active
      MUST initiate a DTLS handshake by sending a ClientHello over each
      flow (host/port quartet).
   o  The endpoint MUST use the SDP certificate fingerprint attribute
      [RFC4572].
   o  The certificate presented during the DTLS handshake MUST match the
      fingerprint exchanged via the signaling path in the SDP.
   o  If the fingerprint does not match the hashed certificate, then the
      endpoint MUST tear down the media session immediately.  Note that
      it is permissible to wait until the other side's fingerprint has
      been received before establishing the connection; however, this
      may have undesirable latency effects.

   Editor's note: FFS if connection attribute defined in RFC4145 is
   needed.

3.2.  Secure Channel Usage

   DTLS is used as specified in [RFC6347].  Once the DTLS handshake is
   completed, the UDPTL packets SHALL be transported in DTLS record
   layer "application_data" packets.

4.  Miscellaneous Considerations

Internet-Draft               UDPTL over DTLS              September 2013


4.1.  Anonymous Calls

   When making anonymous calls, a new self-signed certificate SHOULD be
   used for each call and the content of the subjectAltName attribute
   inside the certificate MUST NOT contain information that either
   allows correlation or identification of the user making anonymous
   calls.

4.2.  Middlebox Interaction

   The procedures defined for SRTP-DTLS in Section 6.7 of [RFC5763] for
   interaction with middleboxes also apply to UDPTL over DTLS.

   The procedures defined for SRTP-DTLS in Section 5.1.2 of [RFC5764]
   for distinguishing DTLS and STUN packets also apply to UDPTL over
   DTLS.

   Editor's note: The complete SRTP-DTLS implementation is not needed.
   Only the parts for interaction with middleboxes in RFC5763 and for
   distinguishing DTLS and STUN packets in RFC5764 are needed.  Should
   those be copied into this document?

4.3.  Rekeying

   After the DTLS handshake caused by rekeying has completed, because of
   possible packet reordering on the wire, packets protected by the
   previous set of keys can arrive.  To compensate for this fact,
   receivers SHOULD maintain both sets of keys for some time in order to
   be able to decrypt and verify older packets.  The duration of
   maintaining the previous set of keys after the finish of the DTLS
   handshake is out of scope for this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   DTLS media signaled with SIP requires a mechanism to ensure that the
   communicating peers' certificates are correct.

   The standard DTLS strategy for authenticating the communicating
   parties is to give the server (and optionally the client) a PKIX
   [RFC5280] certificate.  The client then verifies the certificate and
   checks that the name in the certificate matches the server's domain
   name.  This works because there are a relatively small number of
   servers with well-defined names; a situation that does not usually
   occur in the VoIP context.

   The design described in this document is intended to leverage the
   authenticity of the signaling channel (while not requiring
   confidentiality).  As long as each side of the connection can verify

Internet-Draft               UDPTL over DTLS              September 2013


   the integrity of the SDP received from the other side, then the DTLS
   handshake cannot be hijacked via a man-in-the-middle attack.  This
   integrity protection is easily provided by the caller to the callee
   (see sample message flow in Annex A.2) via the SIP Identity [RFC4474]
   mechanism.  Other mechanisms, such as the S/MIME mechanism [RFC3261],
   or perhaps future mechanisms yet to be specified could also serve
   this purpose.

   While this mechanism can still be used without such integrity
   mechanisms, the security provided is limited to defense against
   passive attack by intermediaries.  An active attack on the signaling
   plus an active attack on the media plane can allow an attacker to
   attack the connection (R-SIG-MEDIA in the notation of [RFC5479]).

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the "Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   Parameters" registry as specified in Section 8.2.2 of [RFC4566].
   Specifically, it adds the values in Table 3 to the table for the SDP
   "proto" field registry.

                  |  Type |    SDP Name   | Reference  |
                  +-------+---------------+------------+

Appendix A.  Example

A.1.  General

   Prior to establishing the session, both Alice and Bob generate self-
   signed certificates which are used for a single session or, more
   likely, reused for multiple sessions.

   The SIP signaling from Alice to her proxy is transported over TLS to
   ensure an integrity protected channel between Alice and her identity
   service.  Transport between proxies should also be protected somehow.

   Only one element is shown for Alice's and Bob's proxies for the
   purposes of simplification.

   For the sake of brevity and simplicity, only the mandatory SDP T.38
   attributes are shown.

A.2.  Basic Message Flow with Identity

   Figure 1 shows an example message flow of session establishment for
   T.38 fax securely transported using UDPTL over DTLS.

   In this example flow, Alice acts as the passive endpoint of DTLS
   association and Bob acts as the active endpoint of DTLS association.

                Figure 1: Basic message flow with Identity

   Message (1):

      Figure 2 shows the initial INVITE request sent by Alice to Alice's
      proxy.  The initial INVITE request contains an SDP offer.


      The "m=" line in the SDP Offer indicates T.38 fax using UDPTL over
      DTLS.


      The SDP setup:actpass attribute in the SDP Offer indicates that
      Alice has requested to be either the active or passive endpoint.


      The SDP fingerprint attribute in the SDP Offer indicates the
      certificate fingerprint computed from Alice's self-signed
      certificate.

   Message (3):

      Assuming that Alice's identity is valid, Bob sends a DTLS
      ClientHello directly to Alice.

   Message (4):

      Alice and Bob exchange further messages of DTLS handshake
      (HelloVerifyRequest, ClientHello, ServerHello, Certificate,
      ServerKeyExchange, CertificateRequest, ServerHelloDone,
      Certificate, ClientKeyExchange, CertificateVerify,
      ChangeCipherSpec, Finished).


      When Bob receives the certificate of Alice via DTLS, Bob checks
      whether the certificate fingerprint calculated from the Alice's
      certificate received via DTLS matches the certificate fingerprint
      received in the a=fingerprint SDP attribute of Figure 3.  In this
      message flow, the check is successful and thus session setup
      continues.
