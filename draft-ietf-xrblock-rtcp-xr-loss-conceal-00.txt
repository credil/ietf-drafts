1.  Introduction

1.1.  Loss Concealment Report Block

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   At any instant, the audio output at a receiver may be classified as
   either 'normal' or 'concealed'.  'Normal' refers to playout of audio
   payload received from the remote end, and also includes locally
   generated signals such as announcements, tones and comfort noise.
   Concealment refers to playout of locally-generated signals used to
   mask the impact of network impairments or to reduce the audibility of
   jitter buffer adaptations.

   The new block type provides metrics for actions taken by the receiver
   to mitigate the effect of packet loss and packet discard.
   Specifically, the first metric (On-Time Playout Duration) reports the
   duration of normal playout of data which the receiver obtained from
   the sender's stream.  A second metric (Loss Concealment Duration)
   reports the total time during which the receiver played out media
   data which was manufactured locally, because the sender's data for
   these periods was not available due to packet loss or discard.  A
   similar metric (Buffer Adjustment Concealment Duration) reports the
   duration of playout of locally-manufactured data replacing data which
   is unavailable due to adaptation of an adaptive de-jitter buffer.
   Further metrics (Playout Interrupt Count and Mean Playout Interrupt
   Size) report the number of times normal playout was interrupted, and
   the mean duration of these interruptions.

   Loss Concealment Duration and Buffer Adjustment Concealment Duration
   are reported separately because buffer adjustment is typically
   arranged to occur in silence periods so may have very little impact
   on user experience, whilst loss concealment may occur at any time.

   The metric belongs to the class of transport-related terminal metrics
   defined in [MONARCH] (work in progress).

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This draft defines a new Extended Report block that
   MUST be used as defined in [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   Monitoring Architectures [MONARCH] provides guideline for reporting
   block format using RTCP XR.  The Metrics Block described in this
   document are in accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6390] and
   [MONARCH].

1.4.  Applicability

   This metric is primarily applicable to audio applications of RTP.
   EDITOR'S NOTE: are there metrics for concealment of transport errors
   for video?

2.2.  Definition of Fields in Loss Concealment Report Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Loss Concealment Metrics Report Block is identified by the
      constant NLC.

      [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NLC with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]


   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Delay metrics are
      Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics, that is, whether the
      reported values applies to the most recent measurement interval
      duration between successive metrics reports (I=10) (the Interval
      Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=11) (the Cumulative Duration) or is a
      sampled instantaneous value (I=01) (Sampled Value).

   Packet Loss Concealment Method (plc): 2 bits

      This field is used to identify the packet loss concealment method
      in use at the receiver, according to the following code:

         bits 014-015

            0 = silence insertion

            1 = simple replay, no attenuation

            2 = simple replay, with attenuation

            3 = enhanced

            Other values reserved


   Reserved (resv): 4 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They SHOULD be set to zero by senders
      and MUST be ignored by receivers.


   block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the Delay block, the block length is equal to 5.


   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].


   On-time Playout Duration (ms): 32 bits

      'On-time' playout is the uninterrupted, in-sequence playout of
      valid decoded audio information originating from the remote
      endpoint.  This includes comfort noise during periods of remote
      talker silence, if VAD is used, and locally generated or
      regenerated tones and announcements.

      An equivalent definition is that on-time playout is playout of any
      signal other than those used for concealment.

      On-time playout duration MUST include both speech and silence
      intervals, whether VAD is used or not.  This duration is reported

      in millisecond units.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE
      SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF SHOULD be
      reported.


   Loss Concealment Duration (ms): 32 bits

      The duration, in milliseconds, of audio playout corresponding to
      Loss-type concealment.

      Loss-type concealment is reactive insertion or deletion of samples
      in the audio playout stream due to effective frame loss at the
      audio decoder.  "Effective frame loss" is the event in which a
      frame of coded audio is simply not present at the audio decoder
      when required.  In this case, substitute audio samples are
      generally formed, at the decoder or elsewhere, to reduce audible
      impairment.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE
      SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF SHOULD be
      reported.


   Buffer Adjustment Concealment Duration (ms): 32 bits

      The duration, in milliseconds, of audio playout corresponding to
      Buffer Adjustment-type concealment, if known.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE
      SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF SHOULD be
      reported.

      Buffer Adjustment-type concealment is proactive or controlled
      insertion or deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due
      to jitter buffer adaptation, re-sizing or re-centering decisions
      within the endpoint.

      Because this insertion is controlled, rather than occurring
      randomly in response to losses, it is typically less audible than
      loss-type concealment.  For example, jitter buffer adaptation
      events may be constrained to occur during periods of talker
      silence, in which case only silence duration is affected, or
      sophisticated time-stretching methods for insertion/deletion

      during favorable periods in active speech may be employed.

      Concealment events which cannot be classified as Buffer
      Adjustment- type MUST be classified as Loss-type.


   Playout Interrupt Count: 16 bits

      The number of interruptions to normal playout which occurred
      during the reporting period.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.


   Mean Playout Interrupt Size (ms): 16 bits

      The mean duration, in ms, of interruptions to normal playout which
      occurred during the reporting period.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.

3.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

   (defined in [RFC3611])

   xr-format =/ xr-conceal-block

   xr-conceal-block = "loss-conceal"

4.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

4.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value NJB in the IANA "RTCP XR
   Block Type Registry" to the "Loss Concealment Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NLC with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

4.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "loss-conceal" in the
   "RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry".

4.3.  Contact information for registrations


      The contact information for the registrations is:

5.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
