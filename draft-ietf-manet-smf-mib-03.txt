Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                  October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of a
   process implementing Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF)
   [I-D.ietf-manet-smf] for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs).  SMF
   provides multicast Duplicate Packet Detection (DPD) and supports
   algorithms for constructing an estimate of a MANET Minimum Connected
   Dominating Set (MCDS) for efficient multicast forwarding.  The SMF-
   MIB also reports state information, performance metrics, and
   notifications.  In addition to configuration, this additional state
   and performance information is useful to operators troubleshooting
   multicast forwarding problems.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   SMF provides methods for implementing DPD-based multicast forwarding
   with the optional use of Connected Dominating Set (CDS)-based relay
   sets.  The CDS provides a complete connected coverage of the nodes
   comprising the MANET.  The MCDS is the smallest set of MANET nodes
   (comprising a connected cluster) which cover all the nodes in the
   cluster with their transmissions.  As the density of the MANET nodes
   increase, the fraction of nodes required in an MCDS decreases.  Using
   the MCDS as a multicast forwarding set then becomes an efficient
   multicast mechanism for MANETs.

Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                  October 2011


   Various algorithms for the construction of estimates of the MCDS
   exist.  The Simplified Multicast Framework [I-D.ietf-manet-smf]
   describes some of these.  It further defines various operational
   modes for a node which is participating in the collective creation of
   the MCDS estimates.  These modes depend upon the set of related MANET
   routing and discovery protocols and mechanisms in operation in the
   specific MANET node.

   A SMF router's MIB contains SMF process configuration parameters
   (e.g. specific CDS algorithm), state information (e.g., current
   membership in the CDS), performance counters (e.g., packet counters),
   and notifications.

4.1.  SMF Management Model

   This section describes the management model for the SMF node process.

   Figure 1 (reproduced from Figure 4 of [I-D.ietf-manet-smf]) shows the
   relationship between the SMF Relay Set selection algorithm and the
   related algorithms, processes and protocols running in the MANET
   nodes.  The Relay Set Selection Algorithm (RSSA) can rely upon
   topology information gotten from the MANET Neighborhood Discovery
   Protocol (NHDP), from the specific MANET routing protocol running on
   the node, or from Layer 2 information passed up to the higher layer
   protocol processes.

4.2.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB.

   o  Tunable Configuration Objects - objects whose values affect timing
      or attempt bounds on the SMF RS process.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the SMF RS process in the router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      CDS multicast process on the router and the overall multicasting
      performance within the MANET routing domain.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the SMF-MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  smfMIBNotifications - defines the notifications associated with
      the SMF-MIB.

Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                  October 2011


   o  smfMIBObjects - defines the objects forming the basis for the SMF-
      MIB.  These objects are divided up by function into the following
      groups:

   o

      *  Capabilities Group - This group contains the SMF objects that
         the device uses to advertise its local capabilities with
         respect to, e.g., the supported RSSAs.

      *  Configuration Group - This group contains the SMF objects that
         configure specific options that determine the overall operation
         of the SMF RSSA and the resulting multicast performance.

      *  State Group - Contains information describing the current state
         of the SMF RSSA process such as the Neighbor Table.

      *  Performance Group - Contains objects which help to characterize
         the performance of the SMF RSSA process, typically statistics
         counters.

   o  smfMIBConformance - defines minimal and full conformance of
      implementations to this SMF-MIB.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The textual conventions defined within the SMF-MIB are as follows:

   o  The SmfStatus is defined within the SMF-MIB.  This contains the
      current operational status of the SMF process on an interface.

   o  The SmfOpModeID represents an index that identifies a specific SMF
      operational mode.

   o  The SmfRssaID represents an index that identifies, through
      reference, a specific RSSA available for operation on the device.

5.2.  The Capabilities Group

   The SMF device supports a set of capabilities.  The list of
   capabilities which the device can advertise are:

   o  Operational Mode - topology information from NHDP, CDS-aware
      unicast routing or Cross-layer from Layer 2.

   o  SMF RSSA - the specific RSSA operational on the device.  Note that
      configuration, state and performance objects related to a specific
      RSSA must be defined within another separate MIB.

Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                  October 2011


5.3.  The Configuration Group

   The SMF device is configured with a set of controls.  Some of the
   prominent configuration controls for the SMF device follow:

   o  Operational Mode - topology information from NHDP, CDS-aware
      unicast routing or Cross-layer from Layer 2.

   o  SMF RSSA - the specific RSSA operational on the device.

   o  Duplicate Packet detection for IPv4 - Identification-based or
      Hash-based DPD.

   o  Duplicate Packet detection for IPv6 - Identification-based or
      Hash-based DPD.

   o  SMF Type Message TLV - if NHDP mode is selected, then is the SMF
      Type Message TLV may be included in the NHDP exchanges.

   o  SMF Address Block TLV - if NHDP mode is selected, then is the SMF
      Address Block TLV should be included in the NHDP exchanges.

5.4.  The State Group

   The State Subtree reports current state information, e.g.,

   o  Node RSS State - is the node currently in or out of the Relay Set.

   o  Neighbors Table - a table containing current neighbors and their
      operational RSSA.

5.5.  The Performance Group

   The Performance subtree reports primarily counters that relate to SMF
   RSSA performance.  The SMF performance counters consists of per node
   and per interface objects:

   o  Total multicast packets received.

   o  Total multicast packets forwarded.

   o  Total duplicate multicast packets detected.

   o  Per interface statistics table with the following entries:

   o

Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                  October 2011


      *  Multicast packets received.

      *  Multicast packets forwarded.

      *  Duplicate multicast packets detected.

5.6.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Subtree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the SMF-MIB and their intended purpose or utility.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The SMF-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The textual conventions imported for use in the SMF-MIB are as
   follows.  The MODULE-IDENTITY, OBJECT-TYPE, NOTIFICATION-TYPE,
   Counter32, Unsigned32, Integer32 and mib-2 textual conventions are
   imported from RFC 2578 [RFC2578].  The TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, RowStatus
   and TruthValue textual conventions are imported from RFC 2579
   [RFC2579].  The MODULE-COMPLIANCE, OBJECT-GROUP and NOTIFICATION-
   GROUP textual conventions are imported from RFC 2580 [RFC2580].  The
   InterfaceIndexOrZero textual convention is imported from RFC 2863
   [RFC2863].  The SnmpAdminString textual convention is imported from
   RFC 3411 [RFC3411].  The InetAddress, InetAddressType and
   InetAddressPrefixLength textual conventions are imported from RFC
   4001 [RFC4001].

6.3.  Relationship to the Future RSSA-MIBs

   In a sense, the SMF-MIB is a general front-end to a set of, yet to be
   developed, RSSA-specific MIBs.  These RSSA-specific MIBs will define
   the objects for the configuration, state, performance and
   notification objects required for the operation of these specific
   RSSAs.  The SMF-MIB Capabilities Group allows the remote management
   station the ability to query the router to discover the set of
   supported RSSAs.

            were made in the development of this draft.
            Specifically, the following changes were made:
               - Removed the smfGatewayFilterTable from this
                 draft.  It is a useful construct, e.g.,
                 an IPTABLES-MIB, but might best be handled
                 as a seperate MIB and worked within a
                 security focused working group.
               - Removed the smfReportsGroup. This capability
                 is being replaced with a new and more general
                 method for offline reporting.  This is being
                 worked as a new MIB module refered to as the
                 REPORT-MIB.
               - Rev'd as a new MANET WG document.

               - added a Capabilities Group within the Objects
                 Group to allow the device to report supported
                 capabilities, e.g., RSSAs supported.
               - added administrative status objects for device
                 and interfaces
               - added multicast address forwarding tables, both
                 for configured (within Configuration Group) and
                 discovered (within the State Group).
               - added additional Performance counters related
                 to DPD functions.
               - Split up the performance counters into IPv4
                 and IPv6, for both global and per interface
                 statistics.
               - Split out the reports capability into a seperate

                  set selection using information from an associated
                  MANET NHDP process.

              CDS-aware unicast routing operation - a coexistent
                  unicast routing protocol provides dynamic relay
                  set state based upon its own control plane
                  CDS or neighborhood discovery information.

              Cross-layer operation -  SMF operates using
                  neighborhood status and triggers from a
                  cross-layer information base for dynamic relay
                  set selection and maintenance

          from the resulting RSS.  This object is a
          switch to allow for this behavior.

          The value potential(1) allows the selected
          RSSA to determine if this agent is included
          or excluded from the RSS.

          The value always(1) forces the selected
          RSSA include this agent in the RSS.

          The value never(3) forces the selected
          RSSA to exclude this agent from the RSS.

          The default setting for this object is
          'potential(1)'.  Other settings could pose
          operational risks under certain conditions.

8.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses security implications of the choices made in
   this SMF-MIB module.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  'smfAdminStatus' - this writable configuration object controls the
      operational status of the SMF process.  If this setting is
      configured inconsistently across the MANET multicasting domain,
      then delivery of multicast data may be inconsistent across the
      domain; some nodes may not receive multicast data intended for

      them.

   o  'smfRouterIDAddrType' and 'smfRouterID' - these writable
      configuration objects define the ID of the SMF process.  These
      objects should be configured with a routable address defined on
      the local SMF device.  The smfRouterID is a logical identification
      that MUST be consistent across interoperating SMF neighborhoods
      and it is RECOMMENDED to be chosen as the numerically largest
      address contained in a node's 'Neighbor Address List' as defined
      in NHDP.  A smfRouterID MUST be unique within the scope of the
      operating MANET network regardless of the method used for
      selecting it.

   o  'smfConfiguredOpMode' - this writable configuration objects define
      the operational mode of the SMF process.  The operational mode
      defines how the SMF process develops its local estimate of the
      CDS.

   o  'smfConfiguredRssa' - this writable configuration object sets the
      specific Reduced Set Selection Algorithm (RSSA) for the SMF
      process.  If this object is set inconsistently across the MANET
      domain, multicast delivery of data will fail.

   o  'smfRssaMember' - this writable configuration object sets the
      'interest' of the local SMF node in participating in the CDS.
      Setting this object to 'never(3)' on a highly highly connected
      device could lead to frequent island formation.  Setting this
      object to 'always(2)' could support data ex-filtration from the
      MANET domain.

   o  'smfIpv4Dpd' - this writable configuration object sets the
      duplicate packet detection method for forwarding of IPv4 multicast
      packets.

   o  'smfIpv6Dpd' - this writable configuration object sets the
      duplicate packet detection method for forwarding of IPv6 multicast
      packets.

   o  'smfMaxPktLifetime' - this writable configuration object sets the
      estimate of the network packet traversal time.  If set too small,
      this could lead to poor multicast data delivery ratios throughout
      the MANET domain.

   o  'smfDpdMaxMemorySize' - this writable configuration object sets
      the memory storage size (in Kilo-Bytes) for the cached DPD records
      for the combined IPv4 and IPv6 methods.  If set too small this
      could lead to poor performance of the duplicate packet protection
      algorithms and lead to inefficient resource, e.g., link,

      utilization within the MANET domain.  The local SMF device should
      protect itself against memory overruns in the event that too large
      a setting is requested.

   o  'smfDpdEntryMaxLifetime' - this writable configuration object sets
      the maximum lifetime (in seconds) for the cached DPD records for
      the combined IPv4 and IPv6 methods.  If the memory is running low
      prior to the MaxLifetimes being exceeded, the local SMF devices
      should purge the oldest records first.

   o  'smfNhdpRssaMesgTLVIncluded' - this writable configuration object
      indicates whether the associated NHDP messages include the the
      RSSA Message TLV, or not.  It is highly RECOMMENDED that this
      object be set to 'true(1)'.

   o  'smfNhdpRssaAddrBlockTLVIncluded' - this writable configuration
      object indicates whether the associated NHDP messages include the
      the RSSA Address Block TLV, or not.  The
      smfNhdpRssaAddrBlockTLVIncluded is optional in all cases as it
      depends on the existence of an address block which may not be
      present.  If this SMF device is configured with NHDP, then this
      object should be set to 'true(1)'.

   o  'smfConfiguredAddrForwardingTable' - the writable configuration
      objects in this table indicate which multicast IP address are to
      be forwarded by this SMF node.  Misconfiguration of rows within
      this table can limit the ability of this SMF device to forward
      multicast data.

   o  'smfInterfaceTable' - the writable configuration objects in this
      table indicate which SMF node interfaces are participating in the
      SMF packet forwarding process.  Misconfiguration of rows within
      this table can limit the ability of this SMF device to forward
      multicast data.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  'smfNodeRsStatusIncluded' - this readable state object indicates
      that this SMF node is part of the CDS, or not.  Being part of the
      CDS makes this node a distinguished device.  It could be exploited
      for data ex-filtration, or denial of service attacks.

Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                  October 2011


   o  'smfDiscoveredAddrForwardingTable' - the readable state objects in
      this table indicate which, dynamically discovered, multicast IP
      address are to be forwarded by this SMF node.

   o  'smfNeighborTable' - the readable state objects in this table
      indicate current neighbor nodes to this SMF node.  Exposing this
      information to an attacker could allow the attacker easier access
      to the larger MANET domain.

   The remainder of the objects in the SMF-MIB are performance counter
   objects.  While these give an indication of the activity of the SMF
   process on this node, it is not expected that exposing these values
   pose a security risk to the MANET network.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXXX" under the 'experimental'
   subtree and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.
   When the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace
   "XXXX" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to
   remove this note.  Note well: prior to official assignment by the
   IANA, a draft document MUST use placeholders (such as "XXXX" above)
   rather than actual numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example
   of how this is done in a draft MIB module.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   This section tracks the revision history in the development of this
   SMF-MIB.  It will be removed from the final version of this document.

   These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-02 to
   draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-03.

   1.  Clarified and added discussion of default values for several of
       the configuration objects within the MIB.

   2.  Added the security section.

   These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-01 to
   draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-02.

   1.  Added the NotificationGroup to the MIB and updated the
       ConformanceGroup.

   2.  Added the definition of an smfRouterID to the MIB.  This is later
       used in the Notifications to indicate the origin of the event to
       the management station.

   3.  Removed the Router Priority object as this was used only in the
       eCDS algorithm and hence should be contained within the future
       eCDS-MIB.

   4.  Cleaned up the TEXTUAL CONVENTION for the `SmfOpMode'.

   5.  Filled in some of the missing text in various object
       descriptions.

   These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-00 to
   draft-ietf-manet-dsmf-mib-01.

   1.  Editorial changes to the textual material.  These included the
       addition of the paragraphs on TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS defined and
       imported into this MIB and relationships to other MIBs.

   2.  Identified those objects in the SMF-MIB requiring non-volatile
       storage.

Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                  October 2011


   3.  Changed the name of the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION 'Status', defined
       within this MIB to 'SmfStatus'.

Appendix B.  Open Issues

   This section contains the set of open issues related to the
   development and design of the SMF-MIB.  This section will not be
   present in the final version of the MIB and will be removed once all
   the open issues have been resolved.

   1.  A careful review by the working group.
