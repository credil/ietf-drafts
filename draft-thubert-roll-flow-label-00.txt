                Use of the IPv6 Flow Label within an LLN

Abstract

   In a Low Power Lossy Network, the traditional tuple of source,
   destination and ports might not be the proper indication to isolate a
   meaningful flow.  For instance, it can be a requirement for the
   aggregation of related measurements from multiple sources to be
   treated as a single flow following a same path in order to experience
   similar jitter and latency.  In that case, the Flow Label in packets
   outgoing a RPL domain could and sometimes should be set by the root
   of the RPL structure.  It derives that the Flow Label could be reused
   inside the RPL domain.  This document present how the Flow Label can
   be used inside a LLN as a replacement to the RPL option and provides
   rules for the root to set and reset the Flow Label when forwarding
   between the inside of RPL domain and the larger Internet, in both
   direction.

Internet-Draft  Use of the IPv6 Flow Label within an LLN        May 2012


1.  Introduction

   In some Low Power and Lossy Network (LLN) applications such as
   control systems [RFC5673], a packet loss is usually acceptable but
   jitter and latency must be strictly controlled as they can play a
   critical role in the interpretation of the measured information.
   Sensory systems are often distributed, and the control information
   can in fact be aggregated from multiple source.

   If this aggregated control information is transported across the
   Internet, it should be treated as a single flow for two reasons:

      The bulk of the traffic consists of small chunks of data (in the
      order few bytes to a few tens of bytes) at a time.  In industrial
      applications, a typical frequency is 4Hz but it can be a lot
      slower than that for, say, environmental monitoring.  The
      granularity of that traffic is too small to make a lot of sense in
      load balancing application.

      The control system may be fooled into misbehaviors if the latency
      and jitter of packets vary from a source to another source for a
      related measurement.

   This is a case where related packets from multiple sources should not
   be load-balanced along their path in the Internet; this is
   discouraged by tagging those packets with a same Flow Label in the
   IPv6 [RFC2460] header.

   The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) [RFC6550]
   specification defines a generic Distance Vector protocol that is
   adapted to a variety of LLNs.  RPL forms Destination Oriented
   Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs) which root often acts as the Border
   Router to connect the RPL domain to the Internet.  The root is
   responsible to select the RPL Instance that is used to forward a
   packet coming from the Internet into the RPL domain.

   A classical RPL implementation will use the RPL Option for Carrying
   RPL Information in Data-Plane Datagrams [RFC6553] to tag a packet
   with the Instance ID and other information that RPL requires for its
   operation within the RPL domain.  Sadly, the Option must be placed in
   a Hop-by-Hop option that must be inserted or removed as the packet
   crosses the border of the RPL domain.  This operation may involve an
   extra encapsulation that is detrimental to the network operation, in
   particular with regards to bandwidth and battery constraints.

   All the packets that are leaving a DODAG of a RPL domain towards the
   Internet will transit via a same root.  The root is an ideal place to
   set the IPv6 Flow Label to a same value across multiple sources of a

   same flow when that operation is needed, ensuring complience with the
   rules defined by the IPv6 Flow Label Specification [RFC6437] within
   the Internet.  At the same time, the root segragates the Internet and
   the RPL domain, allowing to reuse the Flow Label within the RPL
   domain.

   This document specifies how the Flow Label can be reused within the
   RPL domain as a replacement to the RPL option.  The use of the Flow
   Label within a RPL domain is an instance of the stateful scenarios
   decribed in [RFC6437] where the states include the rank of a node and
   the RPLInstanceID that identifies the routing topology.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The Terminology used in this document is consistent with and
   incorporates that described in `Terminology in Low power And Lossy
   Networks' [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology] and [RFC6550].


3.  Flow Label Format Within the RPL Domain

   [RFC6550] section 11.2 specifies the fields that are to be placed
   into the packets for the purpose of Instance Identification, as well
   as Loop Avoidance and Detection.  Those fields include an 'O', and
   'R' and an 'F' bits, the 8-bit RPLInstanceID, and the 16-bit
   SenderRank.  SenderRank is the result of the DAGRank operation on the
   rank of the sender, where the DAGRank operation is defined in section
   3.5.1 as:

      DAGRank(rank) = floor(rank/MinHopRankIncrease)

   If MinHopRankIncrease is set to a multiple of 256, it appears that
   the most significant 8 bits of the SenderRank will be all zeroes and
   could be ommitted.  In that case, the Flow Label MAY be used as a
   replacement to the [RFC6553] RPL option.  To achive this, the
   SenderRank is expressed with 8 least significant bits, and the
   information carried within the Flow Label in a packet is constructed
   follows:

   The first (leftmost) bit of the Flow Label is reserved and should be
   set to zero.


4.  Root Operation

4.1.  Incoming Packets

   When routing a packet towards the RPL domain, the root applies a
   policy to determine whether the Flow Label is to be used to carry the
   RPL information.  If so, the root MUST reset the Flow Label and then
   it MUST set all the fields in the Flow Label as prescribed by
   [RFC6553] using the format specified in Figure 1.  In particular, the
   root selects the Instance that will be used to forward the packet
   within the RPL domain.

4.2.  Outgoing Packets

   When routing a packet outside the RPL domain, the root applies a
   policy to determine whether the Flow Label was used to carry the RPL
   information.  If so, the root MUST reset the Flow Label.  The root
   SHOULD recompute a Flow Label following the rules prescribed by
   [RFC6553].  In particular, the root MAY ignore the source address but
   it SHOULD use the RPLInstanceID for the computation.


5.  Security Considerations

   The process of using the Flow Label as opposed to the RPL option does
   not appear to create any opening for new threat compared to
   [RFC6553].


6.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA action is required for this specification.
