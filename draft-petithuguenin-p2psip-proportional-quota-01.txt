Internet-Draft             Proportional Quota                  July 2011


1.  Introduction

   The base specification of RELOAD defines two variables to set the
   storage quota.  The first one is the maximum size of an element of a
   specific kind, the second one is the maximum number of elements of a
   specific kind that can be stored on a specific peer.  The combination
   of the two variables permits to limit the quantity of data that a
   peer have to store.

   For kinds that are used with an access control policy that does not
   restrict the Resource-IDs, a different algorithm is needed to force
   storing nodes to behave.  This document describes a quota algorithm
   that limits the number of elements of a specific kind that a node can
   store in the overlay, independently of the Resource-ID used.  Another
   way to look at this quota algorithm is that an entity must provide a
   number of peers that is proportional to the number of elements of a
   specific kind that this entity wants to store.

   It is important to understand that this quota works only for an
   overlay comprising only peers, so with a configuration file
   containing a <clients-permitted> element set to false.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Quota Algorithm

   A peer responsible for storing kinds using the quota algorithm
   described in this document MUST maintain a count of the number of
   unique entries being stored per signer for each kind.  This operation
   does not require to add a field containing the Node-ID as the Node-ID
   of the signer is always available in the signature field of each
   element stored.

   For example if a peer is storing 5 Resource-IDs and at each of those
   5 there are two keys whose first 16 bytes correspond to a particular
   Node-ID, it means this node is currently storing 10 unique dictionary
   entries for that Node-ID.

   When performing the quota checks for an entry, the peer starts by
   verifying that the size of the entry is consistent.  It then takes
   the <max-count> configuration parameter for this overlay, which
   measures the amount of entries of a specific kind a particular node

   can store when a <max-count-per>SIGNER</max-count-per> configuration
   parameter is also present.  That value is multiplied by by the number
   of replicas used by the topology plugin (i.e. 3 for Chord) and then
   divided by the fraction of the overlay owned by this peer.  If the
   result is less than one, it is rounded up to two.  This is the
   maximum number of unique entries that can be stored for this signer.
   If the peer is not yet storing this many entries for that Node-ID,
   the store is allowed.

   Note that when evaluating a Store Request containing multiple entries
   per kind, the count of unique entries used for the evaluation is
   incremented after each successful check, but the count will be reset
   to its initial value if one of the check fails.

   The algorithm takes in account only the duplications made by the
   topology plugin.  If another level of duplication is done at the
   application level, the <max-count> value must be adjusted
   accordingly.

   Note that because of imperfect distribution of Resource-IDs across
   the ring, new entries can be rejected even if the total count is
   under the limit.  It is the responsibility of the storing entity to
   calculate the maximum acceptable probability of rejection and to
   increase the number of peers accordingly.


4.  Overlay Configuration Document Extension

   This document extends the overlay configuration document by defining
   a new element in the "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:p2p:quota" namespace.

   The <max-count-per> element changes the meaning of the <max-count>
   variable.  The value "PEER" forces the <max-count> to be interpreted
   as been per storing peer, which is the default quota algorithm when
   this extension is not used.  The value "SIGNER" forces the <max-
   count> to be interpreted as been per signer, which is the algorithm
   defined by this document.

   The Compact Relax NG Grammar for this element is:

   namespace pqt = "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:p2p:quota"

   kind-parameter &= element pqt:max-count-per { max-count-per-type }
   max-count-per-type |= "PEER"
   max-count-per-type |= "SIGNER"
   max-count-per-type |= xsd:string # extensions

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds the following URN to the "XML Namespaces" class of
   the "IETF XML Registry":

   o  Changed "storing peer" to "signer" as this works also for replica
      peers.
   o  The default quota algorithm is per storing peer, not per
      Resource-ID.
   o  Changed the constants in the XML extension accordingly.
   o  Added running code considerations for reference implementation.

A.2.  Modifications between
      draft-petithuguenin-p2psip-proportional-quota-00 and
      draft-petithuguenin-vipr-reload-usage-00

   o  Instead of having a StorageQuota parameter that gives the maximum
      number of entries, reused the max-count parameter (that is
      mandatory anyway) and changes its meaning.
   o  Removed the 3x multiplier to account for the application layer
      COPY, as it is application specific.
   o  Removed the additional 3x multiplier to compensate for imperfect
      distribution, and moved the responsibility to the storing nodes.

A.3.  Running Code Considerations

   o  Reference Implementation
      (<http://debian.implementers.org/testing/source/reload.tar.gz>).
      Marc Petit-Huguenin.  Implements version -01.
