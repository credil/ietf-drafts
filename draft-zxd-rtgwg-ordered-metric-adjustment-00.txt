                Algorithm for Ordered Metric Adjustment
              draft-zxd-rtgwg-ordered-metric-adjustment-00

Abstract

   Upon link down event or link up event, each device in network
   individually schedules route calculation.  Because of different
   hardware capabilities and internal/external environments, the time to
   update forwarding entries on these devices are disordered which can
   cause a transient forwarding loop.  This document introduces a method
   to prevent forwarding loop by adjusting link metric gradually for
   several times.

1.  Introduction

   The internet is the most popular network, it is a distributed system,
   Depend on its configuration, each network device communicates with
   its neighbor, calculate routes and generate the FIB individually,
   finally, the packet will be forwarded hop by hop.  But due to the
   difference of each device hardware capabilities and internal/external
   environments, the route calculation cannot be scheduled at same time,
   the micro-loop occur, and some mechanisms are already provided in
   IETF to resolve this issue, like ordered FIB.

   This document tries to provide a different method to resolve this
   issue.

   In figure 1, there are some forwarding loop scenarios:

   o  Upon link BA down event, for the destination A, if B updates its
      forwarding entry before G, a transient forwarding loop occurs
      between B and G. Node failure MAY be treated as multiple links'
      failure, such as B fails, the links GB, BA, BC go to down.  For

      the destination A, if G updates its forwarding entry before I, a
      transient forwarding loop occurs between I and G.

   o  Upon link BA up event, for the destination A, if G updates its
      forwarding entry before B, a transient forwarding loop occurs
      between B and G. Node failure recovery MAY be treated as multiple
      links' failure recovery, such as B recovers, the links GB, BA, BC
      go to up.  For the destination A, if I updates its forwarding
      entry before G, a transient forwarding loop occurs between I and
      G.

2.  Overview of Algorithm

   This document introduces a method to prevent forwarding loop by
   adjusting link metric gradually.  There are two cases to be
   considered here:

   o  Link up event: The link metric will be decreased from maximum to
      configuration value.  Node failure recovery MAY be treated as
      multiple links' failure recovery.

   o  Link down event: The link metric will be increased from
      configuration value to maximum.  Node failure MAY be treated as
      multiple links' failures.

2.1.  Link up event

   As we know, the optimal paths from other nodes to node R can be
   represented as the RSPF tree with root R. We assume that the link XR
   between node X and R goes to up, some nodes MAY switch their optimal
   paths to R and the new optimal paths include the link XR.  If the
   metric of link XR is small enough, X will be the children of R in
   RSPF tree and the nodes of the sub-tree under X on the RSPF tree will
   switch their optimal paths to R, other nodes' optimal paths are not
   changed.  The nodes whose optimal paths to the R are changed are
   denoted by set of S. If the nodes in S switch their optimal paths
   when link XR goes to up, some forwarding loop MAY exist as described
   in section 1.  In order to prevent the forwarding loop, we can
   control the nodes in S to switch optimal paths gradually instead of
   switching all the nodes at the same time.  For the case of link up
   event, the metric of link XR is decreased gradually by several times.
   Once the metric of link XR is adjusted, one node or several nodes any
   two of which do not have forwarding loop will switch optimal path to
   R. Until the metric of link XR is decreased to configuration value,
   all the nodes in S switch their optimal paths to R. We give an
   example to describe the procedure of adjusting link metric as
   follows:

   In Figure 1, suppose the link BA is down.  All the paths of the other
   nodes to node A can be represented as RSPF(Reverse Shortest Path
   First ) tree with root A(as figure 2 below).

   As shown in the example above, one or more nodes' optimal paths to
   node A will be affected when the metric of link is adjusted every
   time.  The nodes not affected keep the outgoing interfaces and next
   hops unchanged.  There is no forwarding loop during this
   adjustment.(as in Figure 3 H, G, etc. ).

   Once the link metric is adjusted, the new LSP/LSA will be generated
   with the new metric information and will be flooded to the same area/
   level, and all the nodes in the same area/level will calculate
   routes.  So all the nodes need enough time to flood new LSP/LSA and
   calculate routes before the next adjustment of link metric.  Usually,
   it needs a few seconds to tens of seconds delay to start a new
   adjustment.  The delay between different adjustments will avoid to
   affect each other.

   Similarly, for the destination B, we can use the same method to
   adjust the metric of link AB to avoid forwarding loop.

2.2.  Link down event

   In Figure 1, supposing the link BA goes to down, for the destination
   A, it can avoid forwarding loop by increasing metric of link BA from
   configured value to maximum.  The process of adjustment is reverse to
   the process of link up event.  And the RSPF tree with root A is
   changed from figure 7 to figure 2 gradually.

   The adjustment of metric just involves the nodes connected to the
   failure link, other nodes just do normal route calculation.  So the
   method is very convenient for incremental deployment.

3.  Algorithm Sections

   In figure3, the metric of the link BA is set to 121, node B switches
   an optimal path to A, while the other nodes do not switch their
   optimal paths.  In fact the metrics ranged from 121 to 129 of the
   link BA is also valid to ensure that only the node B has to switch to
   an optimal path to A. The following algorithm 3.1 is used to
   calculate a reasonable adjustment metric range for each node to
   switch its optimal path without forwarding loop.

   We first assume the failure link is L(for example, link BA in figure
   1), and its configuration metric value is K. The destination node of
   link L is root node(for example, node A) which is referenced in the
   following sections.

3.1.  Calculating the adjustment range of link metric for each node

   1.  Supposing the link L(for example, link BA in figure 1) is down,
       the metric of link L can be considered as maximum.  It is easy to
       use RSPF algorithm to calculate the distance of each node i to
       root node.  The distance from each node i to the root is recorded
       as D(i, max).

   2.  Supposing the link L is up, the metric of link L is set to
       configured value.  It is easy to use RSPF algorithm to calculate
       the distance of each node i to root which is the destination node
       of link L. The distance from each node i to the root is recorded
       as D(i, min).

   3.  If node i switches its optimal path to root node, the reasonable
       upper metric of link L can be adjusted is COST(i, max), COST(i,
       max) = D(i, max) - D(i, min)+K.

   4.  If node i switches its optimal path to root node, the reasonable
       lower metric of link L can be adjusted is COST(i, min), COST(i,
       min) = MAX{COST(j, max)}, where j is the son of node i in case of
       link L being up.

   5.  When the link L's metric is set in the range of (COST(i, min),
       COST(i, max)), node i can be switched to its optimal path to the
       root node without forwarding loop.

3.2.  Determine existing forwarding loop or not between two direct nodes

Internet-Draft       Ordered Metric Adjustment(OMA)         October 2013


      F is the parent node, S is its son node. if COST(F, max) equals
      COST(S, max), when F switches to the new optimal path to root
      because of link L's metric's adjustment, S will switches
      simultaneously with F without forwarding loop.

3.3.  Algorithm of multiple nodes simultaneously switch optimal path
      without forwarding loop

   1.   Initialize three queues: TentList, CandList, OutPutList.

   2.   The destination node of link L is recorded as root.

   3.   Push the root node to TentList.

   4.   Get the node N from TentList, where N is the node whose COST(i,
        min) is maximum in TentList. if TentList is empty, we cannot get
        any node, then this algorithm terminates.

   5.   Move node N to the tail of OutPutList.

   6.   Push every son node Si of N to CandList, where COST(Si, max)
        does not equal COST(N, max).

   7.   For each node mi in TentList, if COST(mi, max) > COST(N, min),
        remove the node mi from TentList.

   8.   When mi is deleted from TentList, push every son node Sj of mi
        to CandList, where COST(Sj, max) does not equal COST(mi, max).

   9.   Move all the nodes from CandList to Tentlist, then CandList is
        empty.

   10.  goto 4.

   11.  When the algorithm finishes, OutPutList stores node N1, N2,...
        Ns,

        *  In case of link L going to up, the adjustment process of
           metric of link L is COST(N1, min)+1, COST(N2, min)+1,...
           COST(Ns, min)+1, and configuration value K.

        *  In case of link L going to down, the adjustment process of
           metric of link L is configuration value K, COST(Ns, min)+1,
           ... COST(N2, min)+1 and COST(N1, min)+1.
