        <section title="Introduction">
	    <t>
		The SAML RADIUS attribute, binding and profiles are motivated by the requirements 
		of the ABFAB architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-abfab-arch" />. In this 
		architecture, it is often desirable to convey Security Assertion Mark-up Language 
		(SAML) protocol messages between a SAML requester and SAML responder. This can be
		used, for example, to allow a Relying Party to request a SAML assertion from an 
		Identity Provider that describes a particular principal. This attribute and 
		binding are also likely to be useful for other purposes besides ABFAB; for 
		example, SAML-based authorization for network access. The attribute and binding
                are therefore defined generically to facilitate general applicability.
	    </t>
	    <t>
		SAML defines a number of SAML protocol messages
		<xref target="OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os" />, derived from common request and 
		response abstract types. These request and response protocol messages can be 
		exchanged using different modes of transport, such as HTTP; in the SAML 
		architecture, these are known as 'bindings'. SAML already 
		defines a number of HTTP-based bindings <xref target="OASIS.saml-bindings-2.0-os" />; 
		and these are primarily intended for use with the SAML V2.0 Web Browser 
		Single Sign-On Profile <xref target="OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os" /> which
		describes how the SAML protocol messages and HTTP-based bindings can be used
		to effect Web-based Single Sign-On (SSO) by federating an identity between 
		an Identity Provider and a Service Provider
	    </t>
	    <t>
		However the goal of ABFAB is to extend the applicability of federated identity 
		beyond the Web to other applications by building on the AAA framework. 
		Consequently there exists a requirement for an AAA-based binding that is 
		functionally equivalent to the existing bindings but using AAA protocols, such
		as <xref target="RFC2865"/> and Diameter <xref target="RFC3588"/>, rather than 
		HTTP. This document therefore defines a new RADIUS-based SAML binding, building 
		on a SAML RADIUS attribute also defined by this document, to meet this need.
	    </t>
	    <t>
		In addition to this attribute and binding, this document also profiles their 
		application in the context of two specific use cases: authentication and 
		assertion query/request. This is intended to promote interoperability between
		implementations for these common use cases.
	    </t>
	    <t>
		A companion specification <xref target="I-D.jones-diameter-abfab" /> specifies 
		equivalent funtionality for Diameter.
            </t>
	    <t>
		In summary this document specifies:
		<list style="symbols">
		    <t>
			A SAML RADIUS attribute that defines how to encapsulate a SAML protocol 
			message within a RADIUS attribute.
		    </t>
		    <t>
			A SAML RADIUS binding that defines how SAML requesters and responders can 
			exchange SAML protocol messages.
	    	    </t>
	    	    <t>
			An Authentication Profile that defines how the SAML RADIUS binding 
			is used to effect SAML-based authentication and authorization.
	    	    </t>
	    	    <t>
			An Assertion Query/Request Profile that defines how the SAML RADIUS 
			binding is used to effect SAML-based assertion request.
	    		</t>
		</list>
	    </t>
	    <t>
		The RADIUS SAML binding and profile specifications aspire to adhere to the 
		guidelines stipulated by <xref target="OASIS.saml-bindings-2.0-os" /> and 
		<xref target="OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os" /> for defining new SAML bindings
		and profiles respectively. These new bindings and profiles are asked to
		provide a 'Required Information' section that enumerates:
		<list style="symbols">
		    <t>
			A URI that uniquely identifies the protocol binding or profile
		    </t>
		    <t>
			Postal or electronic contact information for the author
		    </t>
		    <t>
			A reference to previously defined bindings or profiles that the new 
			binding updates or obsoletes
		    </t>
		    <t>
			In the case of a profile, any SAML confirmation method identifiers 
			defined and/or utilized by the profile

			RADIUS can be used over multiple underlying transports; this binding 
			calls out the use of RADIUS over UDP as REQUIRED. It is RECOMMENDED 
			that the RADIUS exchange is protected using TLS encryption for RADIUS 
			<xref target="I-D.ietf-radext-radsec" /> to provide confidentiality 
			and improve integrity protection. Implementations of this profile 
			MUST support RADIUS packet fragmentation 
			<xref target="I-D.perez-radext-radius-fragmentation" /> to permit 
			transport of large SAML messages.
		    </t>
		    <t>
			The system model used for SAML conversations over RADIUS is a simple 
			request-response model, using the RADIUS SAML-Message attribute 
			defined in <xref target='SAML_RADIUS_Message_attribute' /> to 
			encapsulate the SAML protocol messages.
		    </t>
		    <list style="numbers">
			<t>
			    The RADIUS client, acting as a SAML requester, MAY transmit a SAML 
			    request element within a RADIUS Access-Request message. This 
			    message MUST include a single instance of the RADIUS User-Name 
			    attribute whose value MUST conform to the Network Access Identifier 
			    <xref target="RFC4282" /> scheme. The SAML requester MUST NOT 
			    include more than one SAML request element.
			</t>
			<t>
			    The RADIUS server, acting as a SAML responder, MAY return a SAML 
			    protocol message within a RADIUS Access-Accept or Access-Reject 
			    message. These messages necessarily conclude a RADIUS exchange 
			    and therefore this is the only opportunity for the SAML responder 
			    to send a response in the context of this exchange. The SAML 
			    responder MUST NOT include more than one SAML response. A SAML 
			    responder that refuses to perform a message exchange with the 
			    SAML requester MUST silently discard the SAML request.
	        	</t>
	    	    </list>
	    	<t>
	            A SAML responder MAY also return an unsolicited response (a SAML response 
		    generated and emitted in the absence of a request from a SAML requester).
	   	 </t>
	    	<t>
		    This binding is intended to be composed with other uses of RADIUS, such as 
		    network access. Therefore, other arbitrary RADIUS attributes MAY be used in 
		    either the request or response.
	        </t>
	        <t>
		    In the case of a SAML processing error and successful authentication, the 
		    RADIUS server SHOULD include a SAML-specified &lt;samlp:Status&gt; element 
		    in the SAML response that is transported within the Access-Accept packet 
		    sent by the RADIUS server.
	        </t>
	        <t>
		    In the case of a SAML processing error and failed authentication, the RADIUS 
		    server MAY include a SAML-specified &lt;samlp:Status&gt; element in the SAML 
		    response that is transported within the Access-Reject packet sent by the 
		    RADIUS server.
	        </t>
		<section title="Use of XML Signatures">
		    <t>
			This bindings calls for the use of SAML elements that support XML 
			signatures. To promote interoperability implementations of this binding 
			MUST NOT require the use of XML signatures. Implementations MAY choose 
			to use XML signatures, but this usage is outside of the scope of this

	<section title="ABFAB Authentication Profile">
	    <t>
		In the scenario supported by the ABFAB Authentication Profile, a Principal 
		controlling a User Agent requests access to a Relying Party. The User Agent 
		and Relying Party use the GSS EAP mechanism to authenticate the Principal.
		The Relying Party, acting as an EAP pass-through authenticator, acts as a 
		conduit for the EAP frames emitted by the User Agent and an EAP server which 
		acts as the Principal's Identity Provider. If the Identity Provider successfully 
		authenticates the Principal, it produces an authentication assertion which is 
		consumed by the Relying Party. During this process, a name identifier might 
		also be established between the Relying Party and the Identity Provider.

			interactions with the original request. The Relying Party, acting as a
			GSS acceptor, MUST invoke the GSS EAP mechanism (either spontaneously or 
			as the result of a mechanism negotiation) and send an EAP-Identity/Request

	    <t>
		This profile builds on the SAML V2.0 Assertion Query/Request Profile defined by
		<xref target="OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os" />. That profile describes the use of the 
		Assertion Query and Request Protocol defined by section 3.3 of <xref target="OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os" />
		with synchronous bindings, such as the SOAP binding defined in <xref target="OASIS.saml-bindings-2.0-os" /> 
		or the SAML RADIUS binding defined elsewhere in this document.

	    <t>
		While the SAML V2.0 Assertion Query/Request Profile is independent of the underlying binding, 
		it is nonetheless useful to describe the use of this profile with the SAML RADIUS binding in the interests of
		promoting interoperable implementations, particularly as the SAML V2.0 Assertion Query/Request Profile
		is most frequently discussed and implemented in the context of the SOAP binding.
