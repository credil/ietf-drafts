This memo documents an optional type of Open Shortest Path First
(OSPF) area that is somewhat humorously referred to as a
"not-so-stubby" area (or NSSA).  NSSAs are similar to the existing
OSPF stub area configuration option but have the additional capability
of importing AS external routes in a limited fashion.

The OSPF NSSA Option was originally defined in RFC 1587.  The
functional differences between this memo and RFC 1587 are explained
in Appendix F.  All differences, while expanding capability, are
backward-compatible in nature.  Implementations of this memo and of
RFC 1587 will interoperate.

This document is a product of the Open Shortest Path First IGP Working
Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
