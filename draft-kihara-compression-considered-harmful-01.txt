Internet-Draft       Compression Considered Harmful         October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Transport Layer Security [RFC5246] is, needless to say, essential to
   contemporary customs in the Internet like secret communications on
   the web.  Names, passwords, telephone numbers, credit card numbers,
   messages, session ids, and any other secrets are transported on TLS.
   Therefore, protecting TLS and underlying Public Key Infrastructure is
   our fundamental task.  Unfortunately, TLS and PKI are not infallible,
   and sometimes vulnerable to new attack vectors.  This document
   describes conditions for the CRIME attack [CRIME] which utilizes
   differences of compression rates to guess secret information from
   outside the encrypted transports and proposes possible mitigations of
   the threat that should be considered when someone designs protocols
   with compression.


2.  Conditions of Attacks

   "Commonly-used lossless compression algorithms leak information about
   the data being compressed, in the size of the compressor output."
   [IACR-fse-2002-3091] In other words, by nature compressing data has
   the risk of information leakage.  Usually information from the size
   of compressed data is not enough to guess the secret easily; however,
   under some conditions the attack becomes much easier.

   Observing encrypted data itself is not so useful.  Though, if the
   attacker can inject string into the compression context where the
   secret is compressed, the attacker would be able to know whether the
   injected string matches the secret or not.  In addition, difference
   of the size of the compressed data in multiple tries will help the
   attacker to perform brute-force attacks.

   [[[More precise conditions are needed.  For example, initalizing
   compression contexts on each try will be a great help.]]]  [[[Note
   that ANY KIND OF COMPRESSION WILL REVEAL SECRETS REGARDLESS OF THE
   LAYER OF COMPRESSION, including TLS compression, SPDY, and HTTP
   gzip.]]]


3.  Application to Existing Protocols

3.1.  Attacks on HTTP

   The original CRIME is targeted at HTTP [RFC2616].  Web browsers tend
   to make requests according to malicious scripts, sending secret
   strings automatically together with injected strings by the scripts.
   To make matters worse, TLS compression [RFC3749] and SPDY
   [I-D.mbelshe-httpbis-spdy] had been compressing all data in the same



Kihara & Shimizu         Expires April 25, 2013                 [Page 3]

   context.  Therefore, stealing session cookies by the CRIME attack was
   very easy.  As a workaround, some web browsers disabled TLS
   compression and SPDY compression partially so that session cookies
   and bearer-token-type Authorization tokens cannot be stolen.
   However, compression of HTTP entities is still available and it is
   possible to guess some protions of HTTP entities if servers return
   injected strings in HTTP entities.

3.2.  More Applications

   [[[More applications are needed?  Currently we have not found such
   applications.]]]


4.  Possible Mitigations

4.1.  Abandon of Compression

   In principle, abandon of compression completely solves the problem of
   information leakage by compression.  It is RECOMMENDED to disable
   compression when communications are not trivial, unless traffic
   increase is considerable.  If data are confidentital and other
   mitigations are inapplicable, all kinds of compression MUST be
   disabled.

4.2.  Compressing Non-Sensitive Data Only

   The problem that this document describes is information leakage by
   compression.  However, if transferred data are not sensitive, we do
   not have to take care of the problem.  Therefore compressing non-
   sensitive data will save bandwidth without exposing sensitive data.
   Note that dynamically-generated contents can contain sensitive data
   and SHOULD NOT be compressed.

4.3.  Using Static Dictionary for Compression

   The CRIME attack utilizes differences of compression rate to estimate
   that the candidate string matches the sensitive data or not.  In
   order to prevent such attacks, using static dictionary will be
   effective, especially when compressing patterned contents like HTTP
   headers.

4.4.  Inserting Random Paddings

   If it is unavoidable to compress whole data in the same context,
   inserting random paddings will be available to prevent disclosure of
   the original size of compressed data.  Note that this mitigation
   cannot prevent attackers from guessing secrets by statistical

   approaches.

   [[[Requirements of padding (ranges of length, randomness, and so on)
   and quantitative evaluations are needed.]]]

4.5.  Detecting and Blocking Attacks

   To achieve attacks on compression, attackers have to make multiple
   traffics in order to observe differences of compresion rate.
   Therefore, detecting too frequent requests and blocking such requests
   will mitigate attacks.  Note that this mitigation cannot prevent
   attacks completely and SHOULD be used with other mitigations.

4.6.  More Mitigations

   [[[There should be more mitigations.]]]
