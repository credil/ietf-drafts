Abstract

   It is a common practice to install a (soft or hard) loopback on a
   circuit interface for various purposes (e.g. circuit turn-up test).
   However, this practice results in disabling IPv6 on an interface
   even after the loopback is removed, due to the way IPv6 duplicate
   address detection is performed.

   This document describes a mechanism to allow IPv6 to self-heal after
   such a loopback is placed & removed.

1. Introduction

   One of the common fault-isolation practices in network operations is
   to install a (soft or hard) loopback on a circuit interface for
   troubleshooting physical/transport layer (layer1) issues.

   However, this practice may jeopardize IPv6 [RFC4291] functionality
   of an interface (corresponding to the circuit being looped) after
   the loopback is removed. This is because the loopback results in the
   router to receive the messages such as the ones relating to IPv6
   Duplicate Address Detection [RFC4862], and consequently disable IPv6
   on that interface, due to DAD check failure per [RFC4862] section
   5.4.5.

   When the (soft) loopback is removed (note that removing soft loop,
   unlike hard loop, does not result in the interface status changes),
   the interface stays UP, and IPv6 functionality stays disabled. The
   only way to fix this is by the manual intervention (e.g. manually
   assign an IPv6 link-local address on that interface and then remove
   it, resulting in DAD to be triggered and enabling IPv6 on that
   interface).

     On the other hand, IPv4 continues to function fine after the
     loopback is removed (partly because IPv4 does not have DAD like
     procedure) with or without the 'warning' about duplicate IPv4
     address when the loopback existed.

   This problem is built-into IPv6 DAD and needs to be fixed so as to
   simplify IPv6-provisioned interfaces turn-up and maintenance
   afterwards.

   This document describes a mechanism to allow IPv6 to self-heal after
   the physical/transport layer looping of the interface. The fix is
   intended to be a simple extension to the ND/DAD logic itself without
   requiring any new messages.

   This document is intended to update RFC4862.



2. Specification Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   It uses the following abbreviations:

   DAD      - Duplicate Address Detection

   ND                     - Neighbor Discovery

   NS                     - Neighbor Solicitation

   Loopback - A function in which the router's interface to the network
        is looped back, resulting in interface unavailablity for
        regular data traffic forwarding. This definition is in with
        that of [RFC1247].

        Loopback function is commonly used to gain information on the
        quality of this interface, by employing mechanisms such as ICMP
        pings, bit-error test etc.

        Loopback function may be done locally or remotely.

   Loop                   - Same as Loopback.

   Soft loopback  - Loopback function may be done in software. This
        doesn't result in interface line protocol going down.

   Hard loopback  - Loopback function may be done in hardware. This
        does result in interface line protocol going down.



   This document uses 'loop' and 'loopback' terms interchangeably to
   mean 'loopback' function.



3. DAD Loopback Solution

   There are three options for solving the issue described in section
   1.

3.1. Solution 1 - Static Configuration

   One may simply disable DAD on an interface and avoid the problem
   described in section 1 altogether. One way to disable DAD is set
   interface's DupAddrDetectTransmits variable to zero, as described in
   section 5.1 of [RFC4862].

Internet-Draft      draft-asati-v6ops-dad-loopback      October 4, 2011


   While this Solution may be the simplest and well suited for certain
   point-to-point interfaces, it has three drawbacks -

   1. Classification of such point-to-point interfaces,
   2. A one-time manual configuration on each of such interfaces, and
   3. More importantly, potential IPv6 brokenness if the other side of
      the router got misconfigured with the same IPv6 address (since
      there wouldn't be any DAD to catch such errors).

   Nonetheless, an implementation may still provide this solution.



3.2. Solution 2 - Dynamic Logic - Protocol Modification

   This solution option expands DAD with a logic (enabled by default)
   to make IPv6 self-healing after the loopback is removed, without
   requiring any manual intervention.

   If an IPv6 node receives an IPv6 NS message, corresponding to DAD
   [RFC4862], having the same source link-layer address and same IPv6
   address (in Target Address field) as the one (to be) assigned to the
   receiving interface, then the IPv6 node must execute the following
   logic:

   1. Log the duplicate IP address & the interface
   2. Send another NS message (for DAD) with a Nonce option (section
     5.3.2 of [RFC3971]), and fire up the timer
   3. If the same NS message (as the one transmitted) is received, then
     keep IPv6 enabled on that interface
   4. If the timer expires, then go back to step 2
   5. If the same NS message (as the one transmitted) is not received
     (upon timer expiry), then enforce DAD criteria as per [RFC4862]
     for keeping IPv6 enabled (or disabled) on that interface

   The timer value is 60 seconds by default, but an implementation may
   allow a configurable option to override the default value. If the
   interface state goes DOWN in between any steps, then the logic is
   exited and IPv6 is re-initialized on that interface for DAD.

   Please note that the Nonce option is included in the NS message just
   to detect the NS message being looped (e.g. there is a loopback on
   the interface). If the remote router happens to receive such an NS
   message, then it MUST silently ignore the Nonce option. The Nonce
   value MUST be unique in each NS message being sent in the logic
   above.

Internet-Draft      draft-asati-v6ops-dad-loopback      October 4, 2011


   This solution simply paves the way for re-running DAD after
   detecting the loopback has been removed, and ultimately enabling
   IPv6 on an interface. Suffice to say that this option is preferred
   and it requires no new message or option.



3.3. Solution 3 - Dynamic Logic - Implementation Specific Modification

   It is possible that an implementation could somehow detect the
   existence of a (hard or soft) loopback on an interface. It is also
   possible that a layer2 protocol such as PPP using magic number
   (section 6.4 of [RFC1661]) may be capable of detecting the loopback
   on an interface.

   This solution option suggests that any implementation, upon
   detecting that loopback being installed on an interface, disable DAD
   on that interface, and upon detecting that the loopback being
   removed, enable DAD on that interface.

   One way to disable DAD is set interface's DupAddrDetectTransmits
   variable to zero, as described in section 5.1 of [RFC4862].

   This solution is specific i.e. internal to any implementation,
   hence, requires no protocol changes.

7. Appendix

7.1. Use Case #1
                                                                                A network operator turns up the circuit (i.e. interface) for the 1st
   time. And it installs the loopback on that interface for initial
   checks and removes it afterwards. This results in IPv4 working fine,
   but IPv6 staying disabled (as described in section 1).

7.2. Use Case #2

   A network operator installs a loopback on a working circuit (i.e.
   interface) for layer1 troubleshooting and removes it afterwards.
   This results in IPv4 working fine, but IPv6 staying disabled (as
   described in section 1).
