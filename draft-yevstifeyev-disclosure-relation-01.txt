1. Introduction

   RFC 5988 [RFC5988] defined a way of indicating relationships between
   resources on the Web.  This document specifies the 'disclosure' link
   relation type.  It designates a list of patent disclosures made with
   respect to the material for which such relation type is specified. 
   Please note that the term "IPR disclosure" should be considered to be
   synonymous to "patent disclosure" for the purposes of 'disclosure'
   link relation type semantics.

   The 'disclosure' link relation type has been in active use of W3C,
   which requires all the W3C documents to contain a link to a list of
   patent disclosures referenced with the relation type being defined. 
   However, it has long been used with no proper specification and
   registration.  This document is to accomplish this gap.  It formally
   specifies the existing practice of use of 'disclosure' link relation
   type and registers it in the registry created by RFC 5988.

   Please note that 'disclosure' relation type designates a different
   resource that 'copyright' type does; the latter refers to the
   copyright statement while the former is used to reference patent
   disclosure.  Please visit RFC 5988 [RFC5988] for more information on
   'copyright' relation type.

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. 'disclosure' Link Relation Type

   Whenever the 'disclosure' relation type is used, the target IRI
   [RFC5988] MUST refer to a list of patent disclosures (IPR
   disclosures) made with respect to the material referenced by context
   IRI.  This also covers the case of empty list and a list containing

   one entry.

2.1. Examples

   This section provides an example of possible use of 'disclosure'
   relation type.

   If the page <http://example.org/ipr/meta-spec/> contains a list of
   patent disclosures made with respect to the specification found at
   <http://example.org/specs/meta-spec/spec.html>, the latter would have
   the following fragment of HTML source code:

   <html>
     ...
     Please visit
     <a rel="disclosure-list" href="http://example.org/ipr/meta-spec/">
     the IPR page</a> for the list of patent disclosures made with
     respect to this specification.
     ...
   </html>

   Or, in the case of Link header field, the HTTP response would contain
   the following header field:

     Link: <http://example.org/ipr/meta-spec/>; rel="disclosure"; 
           title="Patent Disclosures List"

   (Please note that the actual header field will not contain the line
   break and spaces after 'rel' parameter.)

3. Security Considerations

   The 'disclosure' relation type is truly believed not to raise any new
   security issues which are not discussed in RFC 5988 for generic use
   of Web linking mechanism.

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the 'disclosure' link relation type in the
   corresponding registry, with reference to this document, using the
   following template:

   o Relation name: disclosure

   o Description: refers to a list of patent disclosures made with
     respect to material for which 'disclosure' relation is specified

   o Reference: RFC xxxx
