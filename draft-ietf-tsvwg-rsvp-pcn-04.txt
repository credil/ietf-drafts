Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           February 2013      

1.  Introduction

1.1 Objective


   Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) can support the quality of service 
   (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain in a simple, 
   scalable, and robust fashion.  Two mechanisms are used: admission 
   control and flow termination.  Admission control is used to decide 
   whether to admit or block a new flow request, while flow termination 
   is used in abnormal circumstances to decide whether to terminate some 
   of the existing flows.  To support these two features, the overall 
   rate of PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the domain, and PCN-
   packets are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are 
   exceeded.  These configured rates are below the rate of the link, 
   thus providing notification to boundary nodes about overloads before 
   any congestion occurs (hence "pre-congestion" notification).  The 
   PCN-egress-nodes measure the rates of differently marked PCN traffic 
   in periodic intervals and report these rates to the Decision Points 
   for admission control and flow termination; the Decision Points use 
   these rates to make decisions.  The Decision Points may be collocated 
   with the PCN-ingress-nodes, or their function may be implemented in a 
   centralized node. For more details see [RFC5559], [RFC6661], and 
   [RFC6662]. 
   
   The main objective of this document is to specify the signalling 
   protocol that can be used within a Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) 
   domain to carry reports from a PCN-egress-node to a PCN Decision 
   point, considering that the PCN decision Point and PCN-ingress-node 
   are collocated.
   If the PCN decision point is not collocated with the PCN-ingress-node 
   then additional signalling procedures are required that are out of 
   the scope of this document.

   Several signaling protocols can be used to carry reports from a PCN-
   egress-node to a PCN-ingress-nodes. However, since both PCN-egress-
   node and PCN-ingress-nodes are located on the data path, a signaling 
   protocol that follows the same path as the data path, like RSVP 
   (Resource Reservation Protocol), is more suited for this purpose. In 
   particular, this document specifies extensions to Generic 
   Aggregated RSVP [RFC4860] for support of the PCN Controlled Load (CL) 
   and Single Marking (SM) edge behaviors over a Diffserv cloud using 
   Pre-Congestion Notification. 
  
1.2 Overview and Motivation

   Two main Quality of Service (QoS) architectures have been specified 
   by the IETF. These are the Integrated Services (Intserv) [RFC1633]
   architecture and the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture
   ([RFC2475]).

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           February 2013      

   Intserv provides methods for the delivery of end-to-end Quality of 
   Service (QoS) to applications over heterogeneous networks. One of the 
   QoS signaling protocols used by the Intserv architecture is the 
   Resource reServation Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205], which can be used by
   applications to request per-flow resources from the network. These 
   RSVP requests can be admitted or rejected by the network.
   Applications can express their quantifiable resource requirements 
   using Intserv parameters as defined in [RFC2211] and [RFC2212]. The 
   Controlled Load (CL) service [RFC2211] is a quality of service (QoS) 
   closely approximating the QoS that the same flow would receive from a 
   lightly loaded network element. The CL service is useful for 
   inelastic flows such as those used for real-time media. 

   The DiffServ architecture can support the differentiated treatment of 
   packets in very large scale environments. While Intserv and RSVP 
   classify packets per-flow, Diffserv networks classify packets into 
   one of a small number of aggregated flows or "classes", based on the
   Diffserv codepoint (DSCP) in the packet IP header. At each Diffserv
   router, packets are subjected to a "per-hop behavior" (PHB), which is
   invoked by the DSCP.  The primary benefit of Diffserv is its
   scalability, since the need for per-flow state and per-flow
   processing, is eliminated. 

   However, DiffServ does not include any mechanism for communication
   between applications and the network.  Several solutions have been
   specified to solve this issue. One of these solutions is Intserv over 
   Diffserv [RFC2998] including resource-based admission control, 
   policy-based admission control, assistance in traffic 
   identification/classification, and traffic conditioning.  
   Intserv over Diffserv can operate over a statically provisioned 
   Diffserv region or RSVP aware. When it is RSVP aware, several 
   mechanisms may be used to support dynamic provisioning and topology-
   aware admission control, including aggregate RSVP reservations, per-
   flow RSVP, or a bandwidth broker.  
   [RFC3175] specifies aggregation of Resource ReSerVation 
   Protocol (RSVP) end-to-end reservations over aggregate RSVP 
   reservations. In [RFC3175] the RSVP aggregated reservation is 
   characterized by a RSVP SESSION object using the 3-tuple <source IP 
   address, destination IP address, Diffserv Code Point>.

   Several scenarios require the use of multiple generic aggregate 
   reservations that are established for a given PHB from a given source 
   IP address to a given destination IP address, see [SIG-NESTED], 
   [RFC4860]. For example, multiple generic aggregate reservations 
   can be applied in the situation that multiple e2e reservations using 
   different preemption priorities need to be aggregated through a PCN-
   domain using the same PHB. By using multiple aggregate reservations 
   for the same PHB allows enforcement of the different preemption 
   priorities within the aggregation region. This allows more efficient 
   management of the Diffserv resources, and in periods of resource 
   shortage, this allows sustainment of a larger number of E2E 
   reservations with higher preemption priorities. In particular, 
   [SIG-NESTED] discusses in detail how end-to-end RSVP reservations can 
   be established in a nested VPN environment through RSVP aggregation.

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           February 2013      

   [RFC4860] provides generic aggregate reservations by extending    
   [RFC3175] to support multiple aggregate reservations for the same 
   source IP address, destination IP address, and PHB (or set of PHBs).
   In particular, multiple such generic aggregate reservations can be 
   established for a given PHB from a given source IP address to a given 
   destination IP address. This is achieved by adding the concept of a 
   Virtual Destination Port and of an Extended Virtual Destination Port 
   in the RSVP SESSION object. In addition to this, the RSVP SESSION 
   object for generic aggregate reservations uses the PHB Identification 
   Code (PHB-ID) defined in [RFC3140], instead of using the Diffserv 
   Code Point (DSCP) used in [RFC3175]. The PHB-ID is used to identify 
   the PHB, or set of PHBs, from which the Diffserv resources are to be 
   reserved.  

   The RSVP like signaling protocol required to carry reports from a  
   PCN-egress-node to a PCN-ingress-node needs to follow the PCN 
   signaling requirements defined in [RFC6663]. In addition to 
   that the signalling protocol functionality supported by the PCN-
   ingress-nodes and PCN-egress-nodes needs to maintain logical 
   aggregate constructs (i.e. ingress-egrees-aggregate state) and be 
   able to map e2e reservations to these aggregate constructs. Moreover, 
   no actual reservation state is needed to be maintained inside the PCN 
   domain, i.e., the PCN-interior-nodes are not maintaing any 
   reservation state.

   This can be accomplished by two possible approaches:

   Approach (1):
   
     o) adapting the RFC 4860 aggregation procedures to fit the PCN 
        requirements with as little change as possible over the RFC 4860 
        functionality

     o) hence performing aggregate RSVP signaling (even if it is to be 
        ignored by PCN interior nodes)

     o) using this aggregate RSVP signaling procedures to carry PCN 
        information from PCN-egress-node to the PCN-ingress-node.

   Approach (2):

     o) adapting the RFC 4860 aggregation procedures to fit the PCN 
        requirements with more significant changes over RFC4860 (i.e. 
        the aspect of the procedures that have to do with maintaining 
        aggregate states and to do with mapping the e2e reservations to 
        aggregate constructs are kept, but the procedures that have to 
        do with the aggregate RSVP signaling and aggregate reservation 
        establishment/maintenance are dropped).  
  
     o) hence not performing aggregate RSVP signaling

     o) piggy-backing of the PCN information inside the e2e RSVP 
        signaling.

   Both approaches are probably viable, however, since the RFC 4860 
   operations have been thoroughly studied and implemented, it can be 
   considered that the RFC 4860 solution can better deal with the more 
   challenging situations (rerouting in the PCN domain, failure of an 
   PCN-ingress-node, failure of an PCN-egress-node, rerouting towards a 
   different edge, etc.). This is also the reason of chossing Approach 
   (1) for the specification of the signaling protocol used to carry PCN 
   information from the PCN-egress-node to the PCN-ingress-node. In 
   particular, this document specifies extensions to Generic 
   Aggregated RSVP [RFC4860] for support of the PCN Controlled Load (CL) 
   and Single Marking (SM) edge behaviors over a Diffserv cloud using 
   Pre-Congestion Notification. 

   This document follows the PCN signaling requirements defined in 
   [RFC6663] and specifies extensions to Generic Aggregated RSVP 
   [RFC4860] for support of PCN edge behaviors as specified in 
   [RFC6661] and [RFC6662]. Moreover, this document specifies how RSVP 
   aggregation can be used to setup and maintain: (1) Ingress Egress 
   Aggregate (IEA) states at Ingress and Egress nodes and (2) generic 
   aggregation of RSVP end-to-end RSVP reservations over PCN (Congestion 
   and Pre-Congestion Notification) domains. 

   To comply with this specification, PCN-nodes MUST be able to 
   support the functionality specified in [RFC5670], [RFC5559], 
   [RFC6660], [RFC6661], [RFC6662]. Furthermore, the PCN-boundary-nodes 
   MUST support the RSVP generic aggregated reservation procedures 
   specified in [RFC4860] which are augmented with procedures specified 
   in this document.



1.3.  Terminology 

   This document uses terms defined in [RFC4860], [RFC3175], [RFC5559], 
   [RFC5670], [RFC6661], [RFC6662].

   For readability, a number of definitions from [RFC3175] as well as
   definitions for terms used in [RFC5559], [RFC6661], and [RFC6662] are 
   provided here, where some of them are augmented with new meanings:

   Aggregator       This is the process in (or associated with) the
                    router at the ingress edge of the aggregation region
                    (with respect to the end-to-end RSVP reservation)
                    and behaving in accordance with [RFC4860].  In this
                    document, it is also the PCN-ingress-node and the 
                    decision point.

   Deaggregator     This is the process in (or associated with) the
                    router at the egress edge of the aggregation region
                    (with respect to the end-to-end RSVP reservation)
                    and behaving in accordance with [RFC4860].  In this
                    document, it is also the PCN-egress-node.

   E2E (or e2e)     end to end

   E2E Reservation  This is an RSVP reservation such that:

                    (i)   corresponding RSVP Path messages are initiated
                          upstream of the Aggregator and terminated
                          downstream of the Deaggregator, and

                    (ii)  corresponding RSVP Resv messages are initiated
                          downstream of the Deaggregator and terminated
                          upstream of the Aggregator, and

                    (iii) this RSVP reservation is aggregated over an
                          Ingress Egress Aggregate (IEA) between the 
                          Aggregator and Deaggregator. 
                    An E2E RSVP reservation may be a per-flow
                    reservation, which in this document is only 
                    maintained at the PCN-ingress-node and PCN-egress-
                    node. Alternatively, the E2E reservation may itself 
                    be an aggregate reservation of various types (e.g., 
                    Aggregate IP reservation, Aggregate IPsec
                    reservation, see [RFC4860]).  As per regular RSVP 
                    operations, E2E RSVP  reservations are 
                    unidirectional.

   PHB-ID (Per Hop Behavior Identification Code)
                     A 16-bit field containing the Per Hop Behavior 
                     Identification Code of the PHB, or of the set of 
                     PHBs, from which Diffserv resources
                     are to be reserved.  This field MUST be encoded as 
                     specified in Section 2 of [RFC3140].

   VDstPort (Virtual Destination Port)

                     A 16-bit identifier used in the SESSION that 
                     remains constant over the life of the generic 
                     aggregate reservation.

   Extended vDstPort (Extended Virtual Destination Port)

                     An identifier used in the SESSION that remains 
                     constant over the life of the generic aggregate 
                     reservation. The length of this idenitifier is 32-
                     bits when IPv4 addresses are used and 128 bits when 
                     IPv6 addresses are used. A sender(or Aggregator) 
                     that wishes to narrow the scope of a SESSION to the 
                     sender-receiver pair (or Aggregator-Deaggregator 
                     pair) SHOULD place its IPv4 or IPv6 address here as 
                     a network unique identifier. A sender (or 
                     Aggregator) that wishes to use a common session 
                     with other senders (or Aggregators) in order to use

                     In this document, the Extended vDstPort SHOULD 
                     contain the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the Aggregator.

   PCN-domain:      a PCN-capable domain; a contiguous set of 
                    PCN-enabled nodes that perform Diffserv scheduling 
                    [RFC2474]; the complete set of PCN-nodes that in 
                    principle can, through PCN-marking packets, 
                    influence decisions about flow admission and 
                    termination for the PCN-domain; includes
                    the PCN-egress-nodes, which measure these 
                    PCN-marks, and the PCN-ingress-nodes.

   PCN-boundary-node: a PCN-node that connects one PCN-domain to a node 
                    either in another PCN-domain or in a non-PCN-domain.

   PCN-interior-node: a node in a PCN-domain that is not a PCN-
                    boundary-node.


   PCN-node:        a PCN-boundary-node or a PCN-interior-node.

   PCN-egress-node: a PCN-boundary-node in its role in handling
                    traffic as it leaves a PCN-domain.

   PCN-ingress-node: a PCN-boundary-node in its role in handling
                    traffic as it enters a PCN-domain. In this 
                    document the PCN-ingress-node operates also as a 
                    Decision Point and aggregator.

   PCN-traffic, 
   PCN-packets, 
   PCN-BA:          a PCN-domain carries traffic of different Diffserv 
                    behavior aggregates (BAs) [RFC2474]. The PCN-BA 
                    uses the PCN mechanisms to carry PCN-traffic, and 
                    the corresponding packets are PCN-packets.  
                    The same network will carry traffic of other 
                    Diffserv BAs.  The PCN-BA is
                    distinguished by a combination of the Diffserv 
                    codepoint (DSCP) and ECN fields.

   Microflow:       a single instance of an application-to-application 
 (from [RFC2474])   flow of packets which is identified by source 
                    address, destination address, protocol id, and 
                    source port, destination port (where applicable).

  e2e microflow     a microflow where its associated packets are being 
                    forwarded on an E2E path.

   PCN-flow:        the unit of PCN-traffic that the PCN-boundary-node 
                    admits (or terminates); the unit could be a single 
                    e2e microflow (as defined in [RFC2474]) or some 
                    identifiable collection of microflows.

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           February 2013      

RSVP generic aggregated reservation: an RSVP reservation that is  
                    identified by using the RSVP SESSION object 
                    for generic RSVP aggregate reservation. This RSVP 
                    SESSION object is based on the RSVP SESSION object 
                    specified in [RFC4860] augmented with the following 
                    information:
                    o) the IPv4 DestAddress, IPv6 DestAddress SHOULD be 
                       set to the IPv4 or IPv6 destination addresses, 
                       respectively, of the Deaggregator (PCN-egress-
                       node)

                    o) PHB-ID (Per Hop Behavior Identification Code) 
                       SHOULD be set equal to PCN-compatible Diffserv 
                       codepoint(s).

                    o) Extended vDstPort SHOULD be set to the IPv4 or 
                       IPv6 destination addresses, of the Aggregator 
                       (PCN-ingress-node)

  Ingress-egress-aggregate (IEA): 
                    The collection of PCN-packets from all PCN-flows 
                    that travel in one direction between a specific pair 
                    of PCN-boundary-nodes. An ingress-egress-aggregate 
                    is identified by the combination of (1) PCN-BA 
                    (i.e.,  combination of the DSCP and ECN fields),(2) 
                    IP addresses of the specific pair of 
                    PCN-boundary-nodes used by the 
                    ingress-egress-aggregate. In this document one RSVP 
                    generic aggregated reservation is mapped to only one 
                    ingress-egress-aggregate, while one 
                    ingress-egress-aggregate is mapped to either one 
                    or to more than one RSVP generic aggregated 
                    reservations. 

   PCN-admission-state:
                    The state ("admit" or "block") derived by the 
                    Decision Point for a given ingress-egress-aggregate 
                    based on statistics about PCN-packet marking.  The 
                    Decision Point decides to admit or block new flows 
                    offered to the aggregate based on the current value 
                    of the PCN-admission-state.  

   Congestion level estimate (CLE):
                    The ratio of PCN-marked to total PCN-traffic 
                    (measured in octets) received for a given ingress-
                    egress-aggregate during a given measurement period.  
                    The CLE is used to derive the PCN-admission-state  
                    and is also used by the report suppression procedure    
                    if report suppression is activated.

  t-meas:
                   A configurable time interval that defines the 
                   measurement period over which the PCN-egress-node 
                   collects statistics relating to PCN-traffic marking.

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           February 2013      

  t-fail:
                   An interval after which the Decision Point (i.e., 
                   PCN-ingress-node) concludes that communication from a 
                   given PCN-egress-node has failed if it has received 
                   no reports from the PCN-egress-node during that 
                   interval.
 
  t-recvFail:
                   A timer per ingress-egress-aggregate that the 
                   Decision point (i.e., PCN-ingress-node) sets every 
                   time it receives an RSVP Aggregated RESV message for 
                   that ingress-egress-aggregate. When its value 
                   reaches t-fail it is assumed that the PCN-ingress-
                   node has lost contact with the PCN-egress-node. 
                   Therefore the PCN-ingress-node blocks admission of 
                   new PCN-flows into that aggregate and raises a 
                   management alarm.                   


1.4. Organization of This Document

   This document is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of 
   RSVP extensions and operations. The elements of the used procedures 
   are specified in Section 3. Section 4 describes the protocol 
   elements. The security considerations are given in section 5 and the 
   IANA considerations are provided in Section 6. 

2.  Overview of RSVP extensions and Operations 

2.1 Overview of RSVP Aggregation Procedures in PCN domains

   The PCN-boundary-nodes, see Figure 1, can support RSVP SESSIONS for 
   generic aggregated reservations [RFC4860], which are depending on 
   ingress-egress-aggregates. In particular, one RSVP generic aggregated 
   reservation matches to only one ingress-egress-aggregate. 
   However, one ingress-egress-aggregate matches to either 
   one or to more than one RSVP generic aggregated reservations. 
   In addition, to comply with this specification it is considered that 
   the PCN-boundary nodes are able to distinguish by usng the addresses 
   that the RSVP messages are addressed to, and process (1) RSVP 
   SESSIONS for generic aggregated sessions and their messages according 
   to [RFC4860], (2) e2e RSVP sessions and messages according to 
   [RFC2205]. Furthermore, it is considered that by configuration the 
   PCN-interior-nodes are not able to distinguish neither RSVP generic 
   aggregated sessions and their associated messages [RFC4860], nor e2e 
   RSVP sessions and their associated messages [RFC2205].

               in PCN domains, based on [RFC4860]

   Moreover, each Aggregator and Deaggregator (i.e., PCN-boundary-nodes)  
   MUST support policies to initiate and maintain for each pair of 
   PCN-boundary-nodes of the same PCN-domain (1) one ingress-egress-
   aggregate and (2) either one or more RSVP generic aggregated 
   reservations.  Note that one RSVP generic aggregated reservation 
   matches to only one ingress-egress-aggregate, while one ingress-
   egress-aggregate matches to either one or to more than one RSVP 
   generic aggregated reservations. This can be accomplished by using 
   for the different RSVP generic aggregated reservations the same 
   combinations of ingress and egress identifiers, but with a different 
   PHB-ID value (see [RFC4860]). The procedures for aggregation of E2E 
   reservations over generic aggregate RSVP reservations are the same as 
   the procedures specified in Section 4 of [RFC4860]. 

   Depending on a policy the Aggregator MUST be able to decide whether 
   an e2e microflow (i.e., PCN-flow) can be mapped into (1) one RSVP 
   generic aggregated reservation and (2) one ingress-egress-aggregate 
   maintained by the Aggregator (i.e., PCN-ingress-node). Note that each 
   RSVP generic aggregated reservation is identified by using the RSVP 
   SESSION object [RFC4860]. The RSVP SESSION object for generic 
   aggregate reservations is based on the RSVP SESSION object specified 
   in [RFC4860] augmented with the following information:

  o) the IPv4 DestAddress, IPv6 DestAddress MUST be set to the IPv4 
       or IPv6 destination addresses, respectively, of the Deaggregator 
      (PCN-egress-node), see [RFC4860]. Note that the PCN-domain is 
       considered as being only one RSVP hop (for Generic aggregated 
       RSVP or e2e RSVP). This means that the next RSVP hop for the 
       Aggregator in the downstream direction is the Deaggregator and 
       the next RSVP hop for the Deaggregator in the upstream direction 
       is the Aggregator. Furthermore, it is considered that for the 
       determination of the Deaggregator, the same methods can be used 
       as the ones described in Section 4 of [RFC4860].  

    o) PHB-ID (Per Hop Behavior Identification Code) SHOULD be set equal 
       to PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint(s).

    o) Extended vDstPort SHOULD be set to the IPv4 or IPv6 destination 
       addresses, of the Aggregator (PCN-ingress-node), see [RFC4860].

2.2   PCN Marking and encoding and transport of pre-congestion 
        information

   The method of PCN marking within the PCN domain is based on 
   [RFC5670]. In addition, the method of encoding and transport of pre-
   congestion information is based [RFC6660]. The PHB-ID (Per Hop 
   Behavior Identification Code) used SHOULD be set equal 
   to PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint(s).

2.3.  Traffic Classification Within The Aggregation Region

   The PCN-ingress marks a PCN-BA useing PCN-marking (i.e., combination 
   of the DSCP and ECN fields), which interior nodes use to
   classify PCN-traffic. The PCN-traffic (e.g., e2e microflows) 
   belonging to an ingress-egress-aggregate can be classified only at 
   the PCN-boundary-nodes using the combination of (1) PCN-BA (i.e., 
   combination of the DSCP and ECN fields), (2) IP addresses of the 
   specific pair of PCN-boundary-nodes used by a ingress-egress-
   aggregate. The method of classification and traffic conditioning of 
   PCN-traffic and non-PCN traffic and PHB configuration is described in 
   [RFC6661] and [RFC6662]. Moreover, the PCN-traffic (e.g., e2e 
   microflows) belonging to a RSVP generic aggregated reservation can be 
   classified only at the PCN-boundary-nodes (i.e., Aggregator and 
   Deaggregator) by using the RSVP SESSION object for RSVP generic 
   aggregated reservations, see Section 2.1 of [RFC4860]. It is 
   considered that tunnels need to be used between Aggregators and  
   Deaggregators, using the same procedures as specified in Section 4 of 
   [RFC4860].

2.4.  Deaggregator (PCN-egress-node) Determination

   To comply with this specification it is considered that to determine 
   the Deaggregator, the same methods can be used as the ones described 
   in Section 4 of [RFC4860].

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           February 2013      

2.5.  Mapping E2E Reservations Onto Aggregate Reservations

   To comply with this specification it is considered that for the 
   mapping of e2e reservations onto aggregate reservations, the same 
   methods can be used as the ones described in Section 4 of [RFC4860], 
   augmented by the following rules:

   o) PCN-ingress-node MUST use one or more policies to determine 
      whether an e2e RSVP reservation session associated with an e2e 
      Path message that arrives at the external interface of the PCN-
      ingress-node can be mapped onto an existing RSVP generic 
      aggregation reservation state.

2.6.  Size of Aggregate Reservations

   To comply with this specification it is considered that for the 
   determination of the size of the RSVP generic aggregate reservations, 
   the same methods can be used as the ones described in [RFC4860] and 
   Section 1.4.4. of [RFC3175]. 


2.7.  E2E Path ADSPEC update

   To comply with this specification it is considered that for the 
   update of the e2e Path ADSPEC, the same methods can be used as the 
   ones described in [RFC4860].

2.8.  Intra-domain Routes

   The PCN-interior-nodes are neither maintaining e2e RSVP nor RSVP   
   generic aggregation states and reservations. Therefore, intra-domain 
   route changes will not affect intra-domain reservations since such 
   reservations are not maintained by the PCN-interior-nodes. 
   Furthermore, it is considered that by configuration, the PCN-
   interior-nodes are not able to distinguish neither RSVP generic 
   aggregated sessions and their associated messages [RFC4860], nor e2e 
   RSVP sessions and their associated messages [RFC2205].


2.9.  Inter-domain Routes

   The PCN-charter scope precludes inter-domain considerations. However, 
   for solving inter-domain routes changes associated with the operation 
   of the RSVP messages, the same methods SHOULD be used as the ones 
   described in [RFC4860] and in Section 1.4.7 of 
   [RFC3175]. 


2.10.  Reservations for Multicast Sessions

   PCN does not consider reservations for multicast sessions.

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           February 2013      

2.11.  Multi-level Aggregation

   PCN does not consider multi-level aggregations within the PCN domain. 
   Therefore, the PCN-interior-nodes are not supporting multi-level 
   aggregation procedures. However, the Aggregator and Deaggregator 
   SHOULD support the multi-level aggregation procedures specified in 
   [RFC4860] and in Section 1.4.9 of [RFC3175]. 

2.12.  Reliability Issues

   To comply with this specification it is considered that for solving 
   possible reliability issues, the same methods can be used as the ones 
   described in Section 4 of [RFC4860].

2.13.  Message Integrity and Node Authentication

   To comply with this specification it is considered that for message 
   integrity and node authentication, the same methods can be used as 
   the ones described in Section 4 of [RFC4860] and [RFC5559].

3. Elements of Procedure

   This section describes the procedures used to implement the 
   aggregated RSVP procedure over PCN. It is considered that the 
   procedures for aggregation of e2e reservations over generic aggregate 
   RSVP reservations are the same as the procedures specified in Section 
   4 of [RFC4860]. 

3.1.  Receipt of E2E Path Message By PCN-ingress-node (aggregating
      router)

   When the e2e RSVP message arrives at the exterior interface of the 
   Aggregator, i.e., PCN-ingress-node, then standard RSVP generic 
   aggregation [RFC4860] procedures are used, augmented with the 
   following rules:

     o) The e2e RSVP reservation session associated with an e2e Path 
        message that arrives at the external interface of the PCN-
        ingress-node is mapped/matched onto an existing RSVP generic 
        aggregation reservation state.


     o) If the timer t-recvFail does NOT expire for a given PCN-egress-
        node, then: 

         o) If (1) the PCN-admission state for the ingress-egress-
            aggregate associated with the received e2e Path and (2) the 
            state for the selected RSVP generic aggregated reservation, 
            see [RFC4860], are "admit", the Decision Point (i.e., PCN-
            ingress-node) SHOULD allow the new flow to be admitted to 
            that RSVP generic aggregated reservation, see [RFC6661] and 
            [RFC6662]. The e2e Path message is then forwarded towards 
            destination.

         o) If for the same ingress-egress-aggregate and the same RSVP 
            generic aggregated reservation (1) the PCN-admission-
            state and/or (2) the state for the RSVP generic aggregated 
            reservation are/is "block", the flow SHOULD NOT be 
            admitted by the Aggregator and an e2e PathErr message SHOULD 
            be generated, using standard e2e RSVP procedures  
            [RFC4495]. This e2e PathErr message is sent to the 
            originating sender of the e2e Path message, using standard 
            e2e RSVP procedures [RFC2205], [RFC4495]. A new error code 
            "PCN-domain rejects e2e reservation" MUST be augmented to 
            the RSVP error codes to inform the sender that a PCN domains 
            rejects the e2e reservation request.
 
    o) If the timer t-recvFail expires for a given PCN-egress-node, the 
        Decision Point (i.e., PCN-ingress-node) SHOULD NOT  
        allow the e2e microflow (i.e., PCN-flow) to be admitted to that 
        RSVP generic aggregated reservation (which is matched to one 
        ingress-egress-aggregate), see [RFC6661], [RFC6662]. The 
        admission or rejection procedure of a PCN-flow into the PCN-
        domain is defined in detail in: [RFC6661] and [RFC6662]. 
        If the Aggregator is not able to admit the e2e microflow it 
        SHOULD then generate an e2e PathErr message using standard e2e 
        RSVP procedures [RFC4495]. This e2e PathErr message is sent to 
        the originating sender of the e2e Path message. The e2e RSVP 
        error code "01: Admission Control failure" and the "Sub-code = 
        2: Requested bandwidth unavailable " specified in Appendix B of 
        [RFC2205] SHOULD be used for this purpose. 

   The way of how the PCN-admission-state is maintained is specified in
   [RFC6661] and [RFC6662]. The way of how the RSVP generic aggregated 
   reservation state is maintained is specified in [RFC4860]. 

3.2.  Handling Of E2E Path Message By Interior Routers

   The e2e Path messages traverse zero or more PCN-interior-nodes. 



   The PCN-interior-nodes receive the e2e Path message on an interior 
   interface and forward it on another interior interface. It is 
   considered that by configuration the PCN-interior-nodes are not able 
   to distinguish neither e2e RSVP sessions and their associated 
   messages [RFC2205]. Therefore, the e2e Path messages are simply 
   forwarded as normal IP datagrams. 


3.3.  Receipt of E2E Path Message By PCN-egress-node (deaggregating
      router)

   When receiving the e2e Path message the PCN-egress-node  
   (Deaggregator) performs main regular [RFC4860] procedures, augmented 
   with the following rules, see also [draft-lefaucheur-rsvp-ecn-01]:

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           February 2013      

     o) The PCN-egress-node MUST NOT perform the RSVP-TTL vs IP TTL-
         check and MUST NOT update the ADspec Break bit. This is because 
         the whole PCN-domain is effectively handled by e2e RSVP as a 
         virtual link on which integrated service is indeed supported 
         (and admission control performed) so that the Break bit MUST 
         NOT be set.

    The PCN-egress-nodes forwards the e2e Path message towards the 
    receiver.

3.4.  Initiation of new Aggregate Path Message By PCN-ingress-node 
      (Aggregating Router)

   To comply with this specification it is considered that for the 
   initiation of the new RSVP aggregated Path message by the PCN-
   ingress-node (Aggregator), the same methods can be used as the ones 
   described in [RFC4860]. 

3.5.  Handling Of new Aggregate Path Message By Interior Routers

   The Aggregate Path messages traverse zero or more PCN-interior-nodes. 
   The PCN-interior-nodes receive the e2e Path message on an interior 
   interface and forward it on another interior interface.   
   It is considered that by configuration, the PCN-interior-nodes are 
   not able to distinguish neither RSVP generic aggregated sessions and 
   their associated messages [RFC4860]. Therefore, the Aggregated Path 
   messages are simply forwarded as normal IP datagrams. 

3.6.  Handling of E2E Resv Message by Deaggregating Router

   When the e2e Resv message arrives at the exterior interface of the 
   Deaggregator, i.e., PCN-egress-node, then standard RSVP 
   aggregation [RFC4860] procedures are used.

3.7.  Handling Of E2E Resv Message By Interior Routers

   The e2e Resv messages traverse zero or more PCN-interior-nodes. The 
   PCN-interior-nodes receive the e2e Resv message on an interior 
   interface and forward it on another interior interface. It is 
   considered that by configuration the PCN-interior-nodes are not able 
   to distinguish neither e2e RSVP sessions and their associated 
   messages [RFC2205]. Therefore, the e2e Resv messages are simply 
   forwarded as normal IP datagrams. 

3.8.  Initiation of New Aggregate Resv Message By Deaggregating Router

   To comply with this specification it is considered that for the 
   initiation of the new RSVP aggregated Resv message by the PCN-
   ingress-node (Aggregator), the same methods can be used as the ones 
   described in Section 4 of [RFC4860] augmented with the following 
   rules:

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           February 2013      

     o) At the end of each t-meas measurement interval, or less 
        frequently if "optional report suppression" is activated, see 
        [RFC6661], and [RFC6662], the PCN-egress-node MUST include the 
        new PCN object that will be sent to the associated Decision 
        Point (i.e., PCN-ingress-node). The PCN-egress-node reports the 
        data it measures for a particular ingress-egress-aggregate in a 
        PCN object, as specified in Section 4 of this document (see 
        [RFC6661], and [RFC6662]). The address of the PCN-ingress-
        node, i.e., Aggregator, is the one specified in the same 
        ingress-egress-aggregate. It is considered that the ingress-
        egress-aggregate state stores both IP addresses of the PCN-
        ingress-node, i.e., Aggregator, and of the IP-egress-node, i.e., 
        Deaggregator.

3.9.  Handling of Aggregate Resv Message by Interior Routers

   The Aggregated Resv messages traverse zero or more PCN-interior-
   nodes. The PCN-interior-nodes receive the Aggregated Resv message on 
   an interior interface and forward it on another interior interface. 
   It is considered that by configuration, the PCN-interior-nodes are 
   not able to distinguish neither RSVP generic aggregated sessions and 
   their associated messages [RFC4860]. Therefore, the Aggregated Resv 
   messages are simply forwarded as normal IP datagrams. 

3.10.  Handling of E2E Resv Message by Aggregating Router

   When the e2e Resv message arrives at the interior interface of the 
   Aggregating router, i.e., PCN-ingress-node, then standard RSVP 
   aggregation [RFC4860] procedures are used.

3.11.  Handling of Aggregated Resv Message by Aggregating Router

   When the Aggregated Resv message arrives at the interior interface of 
   the Aggregating router, i.e., PCN-ingress-node, then standard RSVP 
   aggregation [RFC4860] procedures are used, augmented with the 
   following rules: 

    o)  If the Decision Point is not collocated with the PCN-ingress-
        node, then other procedures need to be specified of handling the 
        Aggregated Resv Message by the Aggregating router, i.e., PCN-
        ingress-node. These procedures are out of the scope of this 
        document.

    o)  If the Decision point is collocated with the PCN-ingress-node, 
        then the PCN-ingress-node (i.e. Aggregator) SHOULD use the   
        information carried by the PCN objects as specified in    
        [RFC6661], [RFC6662]. When the Aggregator (i.e., PCN-ingress-
        node) needs to terminate an amount of traffic associated with 
        one ingress-egress-aggregate (see bullet 2 in Section 3.3.2 of 
        [RFC6661] and [RFC6662]), then several procedures of terminating 
        e2e microflows can be deployed. The default procedure of 
        terminating e2e microflows (i.e., PCN-flows) is as follows, see 
        e.g., [RFC6661]. 

Karagiannis, et al.   Expires August 23, 2013                 [Page 18]

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           February 2013      

        For the same ingress-egress-aggregate, select a number of e2e 
        microflows to be terminated in order to decrease the total 
        incoming amount of bandwidth associated with one ingress-egress-
        aggregate by the amount of traffic to be terminated, see above.    
        In this situation the same mechanisms for terminating an e2e    
        microflow can be followed as specified in [RFC2205]. However, 
        based on a local policy, the Aggregator could use other ways of 
        selecting which microflows should be terminated.
        For example, for the same ingress-egress-aggregate, select a 
        number of e2e microflows to be terminated or to reduce their  
        reserved bandwidth in order to decrease the total incoming 
        amount of bandwidth associated with one ingress-egress-aggregate 
        by the amount of traffic to be terminated. In this situation the 
        same mechanisms for terminating an e2e microflow or reducing 
        bandwidth associated with an e2e microflow can be followed as 
        specified in [RFC4495].

3.12.  Removal of E2E Reservation

   To comply with this specification it is considered that for the 
   removal of e2e reservations, the same methods can be used as the ones 
   described in Section 4 of [RFC4860] and [RFC4495], augmented by the 
   methods described in Section 3.11.

3.13.  Removal of Aggregate Reservation
 
   To comply with this specification it is considered that for the 
   removal of RSVP generic aggregated reservations, the same methods can 
   be used as the ones described in Section 4 of [RFC4860] and Section 
   2.10 of [RFC3175]. In particular, should an aggregate reservation go 
   away (presumably due to a configuration change, route change, or 
   policy event), the e2e reservations it supports are no longer active. 
   They must be treated accordingly.

3.14.  Handling of Data On Reserved E2E Flow by Aggregating Router

   The handling of data on the reserved e2e Flow by Aggregating Router 
   is using the procedures described in [RFC4860] augmented with:

   o)  Regarding, PCN marking and traffic classification the procedures 
       defined in Section 2.2 and 2.4 of this document are used.

3.15.  Procedures for Multicast Sessions

   In this document no multicast sessions are considered.
   
4.  Protocol Elements

   The protocol elements in this document are using the protocol 
   elements defined in Section 4 [RFC4860] and Section 3 of [RFC3175] 
   augmented with the following rules:

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           February 2013      
 
  o) A PCN-egress-node (i.e., Deaggregator) SHOULD send periodically 
      and at the end of each t-meas measurement interval, or less 
      frequently if "optional report suppression" is activated, an 
      (refresh) aggregated RSVP message to the PCN-ingress-node (i.e. 
      aggregator), see [RFC6661] and [RFC6662]. 

   o) the DSCP value included in the SESSION object, SHOULD be set equal 
      to a PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint. 

   o) An aggregated Resv message MUST carry one or more C-type PCN 
      objects, see Section 4.1, to report the data measured by an 
      PCN-egress-node (i.e., Deaggregator).

   o) As described in [RFC6661], [RFC6663], PCN reports  
      from the PCN-egress-node (Deaggregator) to the decision point may 
      contain flow identifiers for individual flows within an 
      ingress-egress-aggregate that have recently experienced 
      excess-marking. Hence, the PCN report messages used by the PCN CL 
      edge behavior MUST be capable of carrying sequences of octet 
      strings constituting such identifiers. When the PCN CL edge 
      behavior is used, the individual flow identifiers need to be 
      included in specific PCN objects, see Section 4.1 
      (C-Type = RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv4-PCN-CL-FLIDs,  
              = RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv6-PCN-CL-FLIDs)

4.1 PCN object

   The PCN object reports data measured by a PCN-egress-node and 
   carried by the generic aggregated RESV messages specified in 
   [RFC4860]. PCN objects are defined for different PCN edge behavior 
   drafts. This document defines six types of PCN objects: 


   o) Single Marking (SM) PCN object, when IPv4 addresses are used:
      Class = PCN
      C-Type = RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv4-PCN-SM

5.  Security Considerations 
    
   The same security considerations specified in [RFC2205], [RFC4230],  
   [RFC4860], [RFC5559] and [RFC6411].
    
    
6.  IANA Considerations  
    
   This document makes the following requests to the IANA: 
      o allocate a new Object Class (PCN Object), see Section 4.1. 

      o allocate a "PCN-domain rejects e2e reservation" Error Code that 
        may appear only in e2e PathErr messages, see Section 3.1.
