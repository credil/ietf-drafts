1.  Introduction

   This specification defines the JSON "Merge Patch" document format,
   processing rules, and associated MIME media type identifier.  The
   Merge Patch format is primarily intended for use with the HTTP PATCH
   method [RFC5789] as a means of describing a set of modifications to a
   subset of target resource's content.

   For example, given the following original JSON document:

   {
     "a": "b",
     "c": {
       "d": "e"
     }
   }


   A change to the value of the "a" member can be described simply as:

     PATCH /target HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Content-Type: application/json-merge-patch

     {"a": "z"}


   When applied to the target resource, only the value of the "a" member
   will be modified, leaving the remaining content untouched.

   The Merge Patch format generally supports two types of changes:
   removing and setting JSON object members.  JSON arrays are
   essentially treated the same as JSON primitives: the existing value
   is replaced, but not partially modified.  The JSON null value is
   given a special meaning to indicate the removal of an existing value.
   These constraints allow Merge Patch to use a format that closely
   mimics the document being modified.  The constraints mean Merge Patch

   is suitable for patching JSON documents that primarily use objects
   for their structure, and do not make use of explicit null values.
   The Merge Patch format is not appropriate for all JSON syntaxes.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The "application/json-merge-patch" Media Type

   The "application/json-merge-patch" Media Type is used to identify
   JSON documents that describe, by example, a set of changes that are
   to be made to a target resource.  When used within an HTTP PATCH
   request, it is the responsibility of the server receiving and
   processing the request to inspect the payload entity and determine
   the specific set of operations that are to be performed to modify the
   target resource.

   For example, given the following example JSON document:

   {
     "title": "Goodbye!",
     "author" : {
       "givenName" : "John",
       "familyName" : "Doe"
     },
     "tags":["example","sample"],
     "content": "This will be unchanged"
   }


   If the intent is to change the value of the "title" member from
   "Goodbye!" to the value "Hello!", add a new "phoneNumber" member,
   remove the "familyName" member from the "author" object, and remove
   the word sample from the "tags" Array, the user-agent would send the
   following request:

     PATCH /my/resource HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Content-Type: application/json-merge-patch; charset="UTF-8"

     {
       "title": "Hello!",
       "phoneNumber": "+01-123-456-7890",
       "author": {
         "familyName": null
       },
       "tags": ["example"]

     }


   Upon receiving the request, the server is responsible for inspecting
   the payload and determining, based on it's own understanding of the
   target resource media type and the underlying data model of the
   target resource, what specific operations will be applied to modify
   the resource.

   A server receiving this patch request MUST apply the following rules
   to determine the specific set of change operations to be performed:

   1.  If either the root of the JSON data provided in the payload or
       the root of the target resource are JSON Arrays, the target
       resource is to be replaced, in whole, by the provided data.  Any
       object member or array element contained in the provided data
       whose value is explicitly null is to be treated as if the member
       is undefined and MUST NOT appear within the result.

   2.  If the root of the JSON data provided in the payload is an
       Object, for each distinct member specified within that object:

       *  If the member is currently undefined within the target
          resource, and the given value is not null, the member and the
          value are to be added to the target.

       *  If the value is explicitly set to null and that member is
          currently defined within the target resource, the existing
          member is removed.

       *  If the value is either a non-null JSON primitive or an Array
          and that member is currently defined within the target
          resource, the existing value for that member is to be replaced
          with that provided.

       *  If the value is a JSON object and that member is currently
          defined for the target resource and the existing value is a
          JSON primitive or Array, the existing value is to be replaced
          in whole by the object provided.  Any object member or array
          element contained in the provided data whose value is
          explicitly null is to be treated as if the member was
          undefined and MUST NOT appear within the result.

       *  If the value is a JSON object and that member is currently
          defined within the target resource and the existing value is
          also a JSON object, then recursively apply Rule #2 to each
          object.




Snell                    Expires March 21, 2014                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           application/merge-patch          September 2013


       *  Any member currently defined within the target resource that
          does not explicitly appear within the patch is to remain
          untouched and unmodified.

   Because null values carry specific meaning within a merge patch
   document, JSON Arrays contained within the merge patch document
   SHOULD NOT contain null members.  Likewise, object members within the
   array SHOULD NOT contain any members with null values.  If null
   members are contained anywhere within the Array, those MUST be
   ignored and handled as if the null member were not specified at all.
   The null values MUST NOT appear within the modified result.  For
   instance, within the merge patch document, the array value ["a",
   null, "b"] is equivalent to ["a", "b"] and the array value ["a",
   {"z":1, "y":null},"b"] is equivalent to ["a",{"z":1},"b"].

   Applying these rules to the previous example, the set of specific
   change operations derived from the request are:

   o  Change the existing value of the "title" member from "Goodbye!" to
      "Hello!",

   o  Add the "phoneNumber" member with a value of "+01-123-456-7890",

   o  Remove the "familyName" member from the current object value
      associated with the "author" member, and

   o  Change the existing value of the "tags" member from
      ["example","sample"] to ["example"].

   The resulting JSON document would be similar to the following (the
   specific ordering of members within JSON documents is insigificant):

      {
        "title": "Hello!",
        "author" : {
          "givenName" : "John"
        },
        "tags":["example"],
        "content": "This will be unchanged",
        "phoneNumber": "+01-123-456-7890"
      }


   Once the set of intended modifications is derived from the request,
   the server is free to determine the appropriateness of the
   modification based on it's own understanding of the target resource.
   For instance, in the previous example, it is possible that the
   "familyName" member might be required within the target resource and

   cannot be removed.  Note that in such cases, per [RFC5789],
   Section 2, the server is REQUIRED to reject the entire PATCH request
   using an HTTP error response code appropriate to the error condition.

   If the request attempts to remove a member from the target resource
   that does not currently exist, the server SHOULD NOT consider the
   request to be in error.  The requested removal operation is simply to
   be ignored by the server as the final modified state of the target
   resource will still accurately reflect the user-agent's original
   intent.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers the following additional MIME Media
   Types:

      Type name: application

      Subtype name: json-merge-patch

      Required parameters: None

      Optional parameters: "charset" : Specifies the character set
      encoding.  If not specified, a default of "UTF-8" is assumed.

      Encoding considerations: Resources that use the "application/json-
      merge-patch" media type are required to conform to the
      "application/json" Media Type and are therefore subject to the
      same encoding considerations specified in Section 6 [RFC4627].

      Security considerations: As defined in this specification

      Published specification: This specification.

      Applications that use this media type: None currently known.

4.  Security Considerations

   The "application/json-merge-patch" Media Type allows user agents to
   indicate their intention that the server determine the specific set
   of change operations to be applied to a target resource.  As such, it
   is the server's responsibility to determine the appropriateness of
   any given change as well as the user agent's authorization to request
   such changes.  How such determinations are made is considered out of
   the scope of this specification.

   All of the the security considerations discussed in Section 5
   [RFC5789] apply to all uses of the HTTP PATCH method with the
   "application/json-merge-patch" Media Type.
