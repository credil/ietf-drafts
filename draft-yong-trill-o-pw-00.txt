INTERNET-DRAFT                                           TRILL over PWE3


1. Introduction

   The IETF has standardized the TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of
   Lots of Links) protocol [RFC6325] that provides optimal pair-wise
   data frame routing without configuration in multi-hop networks with
   arbitrary topology. TRILL supports multipathing of both unicast and
   multicast traffic. Devices that implement TRILL are called TRILL
   Switches or RBridges (Routing Bridges).

   End stations are attached to TRILL Switches with Ethernet. But links
   between TRILL Switches can be based on arbitrary link protocols, for
   example PPP [RFC6361], as well as Ethernet [RFC6325]. A set of
   connected TRILL Switches form a TRILL campus which is bounded by end
   stations and layer 3 routers. Such a campus may contain bridges.

   This document specifies how to interconnect a pair of TRILL Switch
   ports using a pseudowire under existing TRILL and PWE3 (pseudowire
   Emulation End-to-End) standards.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                           TRILL over PWE3


2. PWE3 Interconnection of TRILL Switches

   When pseudowires are used to interconnect pairs of TRILL Switches,
   PPP [RFC4618] pseudowires are used as described below. The pseudowire
   between such ports can be auto-configured [RFC4447] or manually
   configured. In this context, the TRILL Switch ports at the ends of
   the pseudowire are acting as native service processing elements (NSP
   [RFC3985]) and, assuming the pseudowires over MPLS or IP [RFC4023],
   as label switched routers at the TRILL Switch ports.

   (Although Ethernet pseudowires would be possible, they would require
   an additional 12 or 16 bytes per frame. It would also be possible to
   specify a special custom pseudowire type for TRILL traffic but the
   authors feel that any efficiency gain over PPP pseudowires would be
   too small to be worth the complexity of adding such a specification.)

   Pseudowires provide transparent transport and the two TRILL Switch
   ports appear directly interconnected with a transparent link.  With
   such an interconnection the TRILL adjacency over the link is
   automatically discovered and established through TRILL IS-IS [IS-IS]
   control messages [RFC6325] [RFC6327].

   A pseudowire is carried over a packet switched network tunnel
   [RFC3985].  For example, an MPLS or MPLS-TP label switched path
   tunnel in MPLS networks. Either a signaling protocol or manual
   configuration can be used to configure a label switched path tunnel
   between two TRILL Switch ports. No addition to the existing
   pseudowire standards is needed for this application.



2.1 PWE3 Type Independent Details

   The sending pseudowire TRILL Switch port MUST copy the priority of
   the TRILL Data packets being sent to the 3-bit Class of Service field
   of the pseudowire label [RFC5462] so the priority will be visible to
   transit devices and they can take the priority into account.

   If a pseudowire supports fragmentation and re-assembly, there is no
   reason to do TRILL MTU testing on it and the pseudowire will not be a
   constraint on the TRILL campus wide Sz (see Section 4.3.1 [RFC6325]).
   If the pseudowire does not support fragmentation, then the available
   TRILL IS-IS packet payload size over the pseudowire (taking into
   account MPLS encapsulation with a control word) or some lower value,
   MUST be used in helping to determine Sz (see Section 5
   [ClearCorrect]).

   An intervening MPLS label switched router or similar packet switched
   network device has no awareness of TRILL. Such devices will not
   change the TRILL Header hop count.

2.2 TRILL over PPP PWE3

   For a PPP pseudowire (PW type = 0x0007), the two TRILL Switch ports
   being connected are configured to form a pseudowire with PPP
   encapsulation [RFC4618]. After the pseudowire is established and
   TRILL use is negotiated within PPP, the two TRILL Switch ports appear
   directly connected with a PPP link [RFC1661] [RFC6361].

   If pseudowire interconnection of two TRILL Switch ports is auto-
   configured [RFC4447], the initiating TRILL Switch port MUST attempt
   the connection set-up with pseudowire type PPP (0x0007).

   Behavior for TRILL with a PPP pseudowire continues to follow that of
   TRILL over PPP as specified in Section 3 of [RFC6361].

3. IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions are required by this document. RFC Editor: Please
   remove this section before publication.




4. Security Considerations

   For PPP link TRILL security considerations, see [RFC6361].

   For security considerations introduced by carrying PPP TRILL links
   over pseudowires, see [RFC3985].

   Not all implementations need to include specific security mechanisms
   at the pseudowire layer, for example if they are designed to be
   deployed only in cases where the networking environment is trusted or
   where other layers provide adequate security.  A complete enumeration
   of possible deployment scenarios and associated threats and options
   is not possible and is outside the scope of this document.  For
   applications involving sensitive data, end-to-end security should
   always be considered, in addition to link security, to provide
   security in depth.

   For general TRILL protocol security considerations, see [RFC6325].
