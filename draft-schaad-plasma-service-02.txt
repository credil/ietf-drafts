2.  Components

   In designing this specification we used a number of pre-existing
   specifications as building blocks.  In some cases we use the entirety
   of the specification and in other case we use only select pieces.

2.1.  XACML 3.0

   The XACML specification (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language)
   [XACML] provides a framework for writing access control policies and
   for creating standardized access control queries and responses.  The
   request and response portion of the specification is used to build
   the request (Section 5.2) and response (Section 6.1) messages in this
   specification.  The structure for writing the access control policies
   is out of scope for this document, but XACML is one of the
   possibilities that can be used for that purpose.

2.2.  SAML

   A number of different methods for carrying both identification and
   attributes of the party requesting access is permitted in this
   specification.  SAML is one of the methods that is permitted for that
   purpose.

   SAML has defined three different types of assertions in it's core
   specification [OASIS-CORE]:

   o  Authentication: The assertion subject was authenticated by a
      particular means at a particular time.

   o  Attribute: The assertion subject is associated with the supplied
      attributes.

   o  Authorization Decision:[anchor7] A request to allow the assertion
      subject to access the specified resource has been granted or
      denied.

   While a PDP can use an Authorization Decision as input, this is
   unexpected and MAY be supported.  In addition there are three
   different ways that the subject of a SAML statement can be
   identified:

   o  A bearer statement: These statements are belong to anybody who
      presents them.  The owner is required to take the necessary
      precautions to protect them.

   o  A holder of key statement: These statements belong to anybody who
      can use the key associated with the statement.

Internet-Draft                  EPS TRUST                      June 2012


   o  Subject match:[anchor8] These statements can be associated to an
      identity by matching the name of the entity.

   We cannot pass a SAML assertion with attributes as a single attribute
   in the XACML request as XACML wants each of the different attributes
   to be individually listed in the request.  This greatly simplifies
   the XACML code, but means that one needs to do a mapping process from
   the SAML attributes to the XACML attributes.  This process has been
   discussed in Section 2 of [SAML-XACML].  This mapping process MUST be
   done by a trusted agent, as there are a number of steps that need to
   be done including the validation of the signature on the SAML
   assertion.  This process cannot be done by the PEP that is residing
   on the Plasma client's system as this is considered to be an
   untrusted entity by the Plasma system as a whole.  One method for
   this to be addressed is to treat the Plasma server as both a PDP (for
   the Plasma client) and a PDP for the true XACML policy evaluator.  In
   this model, the Plasma server becomes the trusted PEP party and has
   the ability to do the necessary signature validation and mapping
   processes.  A new XACML request is then created and either re-
   submitted to itself for complete evaluation or to a third party which
   does the actual XACML processing.[anchor9]

2.3.  WS-Trust 1.4

   The WS-Trust 1.4 [WS-TRUST] standard provides for methods for
   issuing, renewing, and validating security tokens.  This
   specification uses only a small portion of that standard,
   specifically the structure that returns a trust token from the issuer
   to the requester.

   This specification makes no statements on the content and format of
   the token returned from the Plasma server to the Plasma client in the
   wst:RequestSecurityTokenResponse field.  These tokens may be
   parseable by the client, but there is no requirement that the client
   be able to understand the token.  The token can always be treated as
   an opaque blob by the client which is simply reflected back to the
   server at a later time.  The attributes that client needs to
   understand in order to use the token, such as the life time, are
   returned as fields of the token response.

   TODO: need to discuss the content model and say what elements need to
   be supported and what elements can be ignored -- safely.

                  Figure 1: Message Access Control Actors

   List the boxes above and give some info about them.

   Email Policy Service  is the gateway controller for accessing a
      message.  Although it is represented as a single box in the
      diagram, there is no reason for it to be in practice.  Each of the
      three protocols could be talking to different instances of a
      common system.  This would allow for a server to operated by
      Company A, but be placed in Company B's network thus reducing the
      traffic sent between the two networks.

   Mail Transfer Agent  is the entity or set of entities that is used to
      move the message from the sender to the receiver.  Although this
      document describes the process in terms of mail, any method can be
      used to transfer the message.

   Receiving Agent  is the entity that consumes the message.

   Sending Agent  is the entity that originates the message.

3.1.  Sender Processing

   We layout the general steps that need to be taken by the sender of an
   EPS message.  The numbers in the steps below refer to the numbers in

       Agent.

   6.  If the policy passes, the Email Policy Service returns the
       appropriate key or RecipientInfo structure to the Receiving
       Agent.  Details of this message can be found in Section 9.2.

   7.  The Receiving Agent proceeds to decrypt the message and perform

4.  Protocol Overview

   The protocol defined in this document is designed to take place
   between a Plasma server and a Plasma client.  The protocol takes
   place in terms of a request/response dialog from the client to the
   server.  A single dialog can consist of more than one request/
   response message pair.  Multiple round trips within allow a client to
   provide additional authentication, authorization and attribute
   information to the server.

   Each dialog contains one or more action attributes specifying what
   actions the client wishes the server to take.  Depending on the
   action requested, additional attributes may be present providing data
   for the action to use as input.  Finally, each dialog will contain
   authentication and attributes supplied by one or more authorities
   that the server can use either as input to the action or as input to
   policy decisions about whether to perform the action.

   The protocol MUST be run over a secure transport, while the protocol
   allows for signature operations to occur on sections of the message
   structure, the secure transport is responsible for providing the
   confidentiality and integrity protection services over the entire
   message.

   Multiple dialogs may be run over a single secure transport.  Before a
   new dialog may be started, the previous dialog MUST have completed to
   a state of success, failure or not applicable.  A new dialog MUST NOT
   be started after receiving a response with an indeterminate status.
   This is an indicator that the dialog has not yet completed.[anchor14]

   Plasma compliant implementations MUST support TLS 1.1 [RFC4346] and
   above as secure transports.  Implementations SHOULD NOT allow for the
   use of TLS 1.0 or SSL.  Other secure transports MAY be implemented.

5.  Plasma Request

   The specification is written using XACML as the basic structure to
   frame a request for an operation.  The request for operations to
   occur are written using XACML action items.  This specification
   defines actions specific to Plasma in a CMS environment.  Other
   specifications can define additional action items for other
   environments (for example the XML encryption environment) or other
   purposes.  (Future work could use this basic structure to standardize
   the dialogs between PDPs and PAPs or to facilitate legal signatures
   on emails.)

   In addition to the XACML action request there is a set of structures
   to allow for a variety of authentication mechanisms to be used.  By
   allowing for the use of SAML and GSS-API as base authentication
   mechanisms, the mechanism used is contained in a sub-system and thus
   does not directly impact the protocol.

   The request message uses a single XML structure.  This structure is
   the eps:PlasmaRequest object.  The XML Schema used to describe this
   structure is:

     <xs:element name="PlasmaRequest" type="eps:RequestType"/>
     <xs:complexType name="RequestType">
       <xs:sequence>
         <xs:element ref="eps:Authentication" minOccurs="0"/>
         <xs:element ref="xacml:Request"/>
       </xs:sequence>
       <xs:attribute name="Version" type="xs:string" default="1.0"/>
     </xs:complexType>

   The RequestType has two elements in it:

   Authentication  is an optional element that holds the structures used
      for doing authentication and authorization.  Unless no
      authentication is required by the Plasma server, the element is
      going to exist for one or more requests in the dialog.

   xacml:Request  is a required element that contains the control
      information for the action requested.  The control information
      takes the form of an action request plus additional data to be
      used as part of the action request.  The data and actions are to
      be treated as self-asserted, that is they are deemed not to come
      from a reliable source even in the event that an authentication is
      successfully completed.  As self-asserted values, Plasma servers
      need to exercise extreme care about which are included in the
      policy enforcement decisions.  As an example, it makes sense to
      allow for the action identifier to be included in the policy

      enforcement, but assertions about the identity of the subject
      should be omitted.  This element is taken from the XACML
      specification.

   For some operations, display string values are returned as part of
   the response from the server.  The xml:lang attribute SHOULD be
   included in the RequestType element to inform the server as to what
   language client wishes to have the strings in.  The server SHOULD
   attempt to return strings in the language requested or a related
   language if at all possible.

5.1.  Authentication Element

   One of the major goals in the Plasma work is to detach the process of
   authentication specifics from the Plasma protocol.  In order to
   accomplish this we are specifying the use of two general mechanisms
   (SAML and GSS-API) which can be configured and expanded without
   changing the core Plasma protocol itself.  The authentication element
   has two main purposes: 1) to process the authentication being used by
   the client and 2) to carry authenticated attributes for use in the
   policy evaluation.

   When transporting the authentication information, one needs to
   recognize that there may be a single or multiple messages in the
   dialog in order to complete the authentication process.  In
   performing the process of authenticating, any or all of the elements
   in this structure can be used.  If there are multiple elements filled
   out, the server can choose to process the elements in any order.
   This means that the Plasma protocol itself does not favor any
   specific mechanism.  The current set of mechanisms that are built
   into the Plasma specification are:

   o  SAML Assertions - many different types of SAML assertions are
      supported.  The specification uses both bearer and holder of key
      assertions.

   o  X.509 Certificates can be used for the purpose of authentication
      by creating a signature with the XML Digital Signature standard.

   o  GSS-API - the specification allows for the use of GSS-API in
      performing the authentication process.  The ABFAB mechanism in
      GSS-API is specifically designed for use in a federated community
      and allows for both authentication and attribute information to be
      queried from the identity server.

   o  WS-Trust[anchor16] tokens allow for much of the same type of
      information to be passed as SAML assertions.  The Plasma
      specification has been designed mailing for the use of WS-Trust

      tokens to be used for caching prior authentication sessions.

   More than one authentication element can be present in any single
   message.  This is because a client may need to provide more than one
   piece of data to a server in order to authenticate, for example a
   holder of key SAML Assertion along with a signature created with that
   key.  Additionally a client may want to provide the server an option
   of different ways of doing the authentication.  In a federated
   scenario, an X.509 certificate with a signature can be presented and
   the server may not be able to build a trust path to it's set of trust
   anchors.  In this case the client may need to use the GSS-API/EAP
   protocol for doing the authentication.  The client may want to
   provide the server with one or more SAML Assertion that binds a
   number of attributes to it's identities so that the server does not
   need to ask for those attributes at a later time.  Finally, multiple
   entities may need to be validated (for example the user and the
   user's machine).

   When transporting the attribute information, one needs to recognize
   that there may be single or multiple messages in the dialog in order
   to complete the authorization process.  The server will return a
   status code of urn:oasis:names:xacml:1.0:status:missing-attribute in
   the event that one or more attributes are needed in order to complete
   the authorization process.  The details on how XACML returns missing
   attribute information is found in Section 7.17.3 of [XACML].  When
   the list of attributes is returned, the client has two choices: 1) It
   can close the dialog, look for a source of the missing attributes and
   then start a new dialog, 2) it can just get an assertion for the
   missing attributes and send the new assertion as in a new request
   message within the same dialog.  The decision of which process to use
   will depend in part on how long it is expected to take to get the new
   attribute assertion to be returned.

   The same authentication data does not need to be re-transmitted to
   the server in a subsequent message within a single dialog.  The
   server MUST retain all authenticated assertion information during a
   single dialog.

   The schema for the Authentication element directly maps to the
   ability to hold the above elements.  The schema for the
   Authentication element is:

   The schema allows for multiple authentication elements to occur in
   any order.  It is suggested, but not required, that the ds2:Signature
   element occur after the authentication element that has an assoicated
   key.  This makes it easier for servers to make a one pass validate of
   all authentication elements.

   The Other element is provided to allow for additional authentication
   elements, include SAML version 1.1, to be used.

5.1.1.  SAML Assertion

   SAML Assertions can provide authentication or attribute information
   to the server.  A SAML statement only needs to be provided once
   during a single dialog, the server MUST remember all attributes
   during the dialog.

   When a SAML Assertion contains a SubjectConformation element using
   the KeyInfoConfirmationDataType as a subject conformation element,
   the confirmation shall be performed by the creation of an XML
   Signature authentication element.  The signature element shall be
   created using an appropriate algorithm for the key referenced in the
   SAML statement.

   Identify a SAML statement in the delegation/subject/environment space
   - need text for this

5.1.2.  WS Trust Tokens

   WS Trust tokens are used in two different ways by this specification.
   They can be used as the primary introduction method of a client to
   the server, or they can be used by the server to allow the client to
   be re-introduced to the server in such a way that the server can use
   cached information.

   WS Trust tokens come in two basic flavors: Bearer tokens[anchor18]
   and Holder of Key tokens.  With the first flavor, presentation of the
   token is considered to be sufficient to allow the server to validate
   the identity of the presenter and know the appropriate attributes to
   make a policy decision.  In the second flavor some type of
   cryptographic operation is needed in addition to just presenting the
   token.  The Signature element Section 5.1.3 provides necessary
   infrastructure to permit the cryptographic result to be passed to the
   server.

   This document does not define the content or structure of any tokens
   to be used.  This is strictly an implementation issue for the servers
   in question.  This is because the client can treat the WS Token value
   presented to it as an opaque blob.[anchor19] Only the servers need to
   understand how to process the blob.  However there are some
   additional fields which can be returned in addition to the token that
   need to be discussed:

   wst:TokenType  SHOULD be returned if more than one type of token is
      used by the set of servers.  If a token type is returned to the
      client, the client MUST include the element when the token is
      returned to the server.

   wst:BinarySecret  SHOULD be returned for moderate duration tokens.
      If a binary secret is returned then the client MUST provide
      protection for the secret value.  When a binary secret has been
      returned, then the client MUST create either a signature or MAC
      value and place it into the Signature element Section 5.1.3.
      [anchor20].

   wst:Lifetime  MUST be returned with the wsu:Expires element set.  The
      wsu:Created element MAY be included.  The element provides the
      client a way to know when a token is going to expire and obtain a
      new one as needed.

5.1.3.  XML Signature Element

   When a holder of key credential is used to determine the attributes
   associated with an entity, there is a requirement that the key be
   used in a proof of possession step so that the Plasma server can
   validate that the entity does hold the key.  The credentials can hold
   either asymmetric keys (X.509 certificates and SAML Assertions) or
   symmetric keys (WS Trust Tokens and SAML Assertions) which use
   Digital Signatures or Message Authentication Codes (MACs)
   respectively to create and validate a key usage statement.  The XML
   signature standard [XML-Signature] provides an infrastructure to for
   conveying the proof of possession information.

   The signature is computed over the XACML request element as a
   detached signature.  When a signature element exists in the message,
   the ChannelBinding attribute (Section 10.1.1) MUST be included in the
   request.  By the use of a value which is derived from the
   cryptographic keys used in for protecting the tunnel, it is possible
   for the server to verify that the authentication values computed were
   done specifically for this specific dialog and are not replayed.

   When creating either a signature or a MAC, the following statements
   hold:

   o  The canonicalization algorithm Canonical XML 1.1 [XML-C14N11]
      without comments MUST be supported and SHOULD be used in preparing
      the XML node set for hashing.  Other canonicalization algorithms
      MAY be used.

   o  The signature algorithms RSAwithSHA256 and ECDSAwithSHA256 MUST be
      supported by servers.  At least one of the algorithms MUST be
      supported by clients.  The MAC algorithm HMAC-SHA256 MUST be
      supported by both clients and servers.  Other signature and MAC
      algorithms MAY be supported.

   o  Set the additional attributes that must be included in a signature
      - what should they be?

   o  If an xacml:Request element is referenced by an XML Signature
      element, the xacml:Request element MUST include the ChannelBinding
      token (Section 10.1.1) as one of the attributes.

   o  The keys used in computing the authentication value need to be
      identified for the recipient.  For X509 certificates, the full raw
      certificate will normally be included as part of the signature,
      but MAY be referenced instead.  For SAML assertions, the specific
      assertion carrying the asymmetric key can be identified by TBD
      HERE.  In the event that symmetric keys are used by holder of key

      assertions, the specific assertion will be identified by TBD HERE.
      In these cases the server is expected to be able to associated the
      key with the assertion by some means (either locally or perhaps
      encrypted into the assertion).

5.1.4.  GSS-API Element

   TBD - rules for using GSS-API in general and the EAP version from
   ABFAB particularly.

   o  How to build the name.

   o  Must use a secure tunnel for the outer EAP method and an
      appropriate inner EAP method(s) to accomplish the required level
      of authentication.

   o  Server query of attributes and specification of LOA to the EAP
      IdP.

   o  Any additional Trust model items.

   o  How round trips are accomplished - the only case that a server
      will send back an Authentication element is on return processing
      of GSS-API messages.

5.2.  xacml:Request Element

   The request for an action to be performed by the Plasma server along
   with the data that needs to be supplied by the client in order for
   the server to complete the action are placed into the xacml:Request
   element of the request.  This document defines a set of actions that
   are to be understood by the Plasma server.  One (or more) action is
   to be placed in the request message.

   In addition to the request for a specific action to occur, the client
   can place additional attributes in the request as well.  These
   attributes are provided in order to assist the server either in
   identifying who the various agents on the client side are or to
   provide suggestions of attributes for using in making control
   decisions.  Any data provided by the client in this manner is to be
   considered as a self-asserted value and to be treated as if it comes
   from the client as oppose to a trusted attribute agent.

   For convenience the schema for the xacml:Request element is
   reproduced here:

6.  Plasma Response Element

   There is a single top level structure that is used by the server to
   respond to a client request.

   The XML Schema used to describe the top level response is as follows:

  <xs:element name="PlasmaResponse" type="eps:ResponseType"/>
  <xs:complexType name="ResponseType">
    <xs:sequence>
      <xs:element ref="xacml:Response"/>
      <xs:element ref="eps:PlasmaReturnToken" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
    </xs:sequence>
    <xs:attribute name="Version" type="xs:string" default="1.0"/>
  </xs:complexType>
  <xs:element name="PlasmaReturnToken" type="eps:PlasmaReturnTokenType" abstract="true"/>
  <xs:complexType name="PlasmaReturnTokenType" abstract="true">
    <xs:attribute name="DecisionId"/>
  </xs:complexType>

   A Plasma Response has two elements:

   xacml:Response  is a mandatory element that returns the status of the
      access request.

   PlasmaReturnToken  is an optional element that will return one or
      more PlasmaReturnToken elements.  These tokens represent the
      answer, for a success, of the request.

   A Plasma Return Token is the base type from which return values are
   derived.  The optional attribute Decision is defined for correlation
   of requests and results in the event that multiple requests are made.
   This document defines the following items that are derived from this
   type:

   o  RoleToken - used to return roles.

6.1.  xacml:Response Element

   The xacml:Response element has the ability to return both a decision,
   but additionally information about why a decision was not made.

   The schema for the xacml:Response element is reproduced here for
   convenience:

   The xacml:Response element consists of one child the Result.

   The xacml:Response element consists of the following elements:

   xacml:Decision  is a mandatory element that returns the possible
      decisions of the access control decision.  The set of permitted
      values are Permit, Deny, Indeterminate and No Policy.

   xacml:Status  is an optional element returned for the Indeterminate
      status which provides for the reason that a decision was not able
      to be reached.  Additionally it can contain hints for remedying
      the situation.  This document defines a new set of status values
      to be returned.  Formal declaration may be found in Section 12.

      *  gss-api indicates that a gss-api message has been returned as
         part of the authentication process.

   xacml:Obligations  is designed to force the PEP to perform specific
      actions prior to allowing access to the resource.  If a response
      is returned with this element present, the processing MUST fail
      unless the PEP can perform the required action.  A set of Plasma
      specific obligations are found in Section 10.2. [anchor23]

   xacml:AssocatedAdvice  is designed to give suggestions to the PEP
      about performing specific actions prior to allowing access to the
      resource.  This element is not used by Plasma and SHOULD be
      absent.  If the response is returned with this element present,
      processing will succeed even if the PEP does not know how to
      perform the required action.  A set of Plasma specific advice

      elements are found in Section 10.2.

   xacml:Attributes  provides a location for the server to return
      attributes used in the access control evaluation process.  Only
      those attributes requested in the Attributes section of the
      request are to be returned.  Since Plasma does not generally
      supply attributes for the evaluation process, this field will
      normally be absent.

   xacml:PolicyIdentifierList  provides a location to return the set of
      policies used to grant access to the resource.  This element is
      expected to be absent for Plasma. [anchor24][anchor25]

7.  Role Token and Policy Acquisition

   In order to send an email using a Plasma server, the first step is to
   obtain a role token that provides the description of the labels that
   can be applied and the authorization to send an email using one or
   more of the labels.  The process of obtaining the role token is
   designed to be a request/response round trip to the Plasma server.
   In practice a number of round trips may be necessary in order to
   provide all of the identity and attributes to the Plasma server that
   are needed to evaluate the policies for the labels.

   When a Plasma server receives a role token request from a client, it
   needs to perform a policy evaluation for all of the policies that it
   arbitrates along with all of the options for those policies.  In
   general, the first time that a client requests a role token from the
   server, it will not know the level of authentication that is needed
   or the set of attributes that needs to be presented in order to get
   the set of tokens.  A server MUST NOT issue a role token without
   first attempting to retrieve from an attribute source (either the
   client or a back end server) all of the attributes required to check
   all policies.  Since the work load required on the server is expected
   to be potentially extensive for creating the role token, it is
   expected that the token returned will be valid for a period of time.
   This will allow for the frequency of the operation to be reduced.
   While the use of an extant role token can be used for identity proof,
   it is not generally suggested that a new token be issued without
   doing a full evaluation of the attributes of the client as either the
   policy or the set of client attributes may have changed in the mean
   time.

7.1.  Role Token Request

   The process starts by a client sending a server a role token request.
   Generally, but not always, the request will include some type of
   identity proof information and a set of attributes.  It is suggested
   that, after the first successful conversation, the client cache hints
   about the identity and attributes needed for a server.  This allows
   for fewer round trips in later conversations.  An example of a
   request token can be found in Appendix B.

   The role token request, as with all requests, uses the eps:
   PlasmaRequest XML structure.  The eps:Authentication MAY be included
   on the first message and MUST be included on subsequent
   authentication round trips.

   A role token request by a client MUST include the GetRoleTokens
   Plasma action request as an attribute of the xacml:Request element.
   Details on the action can be found in section Section 12.1.  When

   role tokens are requested, no additional data needs to be supplied by
   the requester.

   An example of a message requesting the set of policy information is:

   <esp:PlasmaRequest>
     <eps:Authentication>...</eps:Authentication>
     <xacml:Request>
       <xacml:Attributes Category="...:action">
         <xacml:Attribute AttributeId="urn:plasma:action-id">
           <xacml:AttributeValue
              DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">
             GetRoleToken</xacml:AttributeValue>
         </xacml:Attribute>
       </xacml:Attributes>
     </xacml:Request>
   </esp:PlasmaRequest>

7.2.  Request Role Token Response

   In response to a role token request, the Plasma server returns a role
   token response.  The response uses the eps:PlasmaResponse XML
   structure.  When a response is create the following should be noted:

   An xacml:Decision is always included in a response.  The values
   permitted are:

   Permit  is used to signal success.  In this case the response MUST
      include one or more eps:RoleToken element.

   Deny  is used to signal failure.  In this case the xacml:Status
      element MUST be present an contain a failure reason.

   Indeterminate  is used to signal that a final result has not yet been
      reached.  When this decision is reached, the server SHOULD return
      a list of additional attributes to be returned and SHOULD return
      the list of role tokens that have been granted based on the
      attributes received to that point.

   NotApplicable  is returned if the Plasma server does not have the
      capability to issue role tokens.

   An example of a response returning the set of policy information is:

   In this example, the Email Policy Service is returning three
   different policies that can be used along with a security token and a
   key to be used with the token when sending an email.

7.2.1.  RoleToken XML element

   The eps:PlasmaTokens element is used to return one or more tokens to
   the client.  Each token returned will contain one or more policies
   that can be asserted with the token and the token itself.
   Additionally the name of a Plasma server to be used with the token
   can be included as well as cryptographic information to be used with
   the token.

   The eps:PlasmaTokens field will contain one or more eps:PlasmaToken
   elements.

   The eps:PlasmaToken element contains the following items:

   PDP  is an optional element.  If the element is present, it provides
      one or more URLs to be used for containing a Plasma server for the
      purpose of sending a message.  This element allows for the use of
      different Plasma servers for issuing role tokens and message
      tokens.  No ranking of the servers is implied by the order of the
      URLs returned.

   PolicyList  contains the description of one or more policies that can
      be asserted using the issued token.  Any of the policies contained
      in the list may be combined together using the policy logic in
      constructing a label during the send message process.

   Label  contains a single specific label.  This element is returned as
      part of a read message token to allow for replies to be formulated
      by an entity that cannot generally originate a message using the
      policy.

   wst:RequestSecurityTokenResponse  contains the actual token itself.

   The eps:PolicyType type is used to represent the elements of a policy
   to the client.  The elements in this type are:

   Name  contains a display string that represents the policy.  This
      element is localized in response to the TBD attribute in the TBD
      field.

   Identifier  contains a "unique" identifier for the policy.  This is
      the value that identifies the policy to the software.  The type
      for the value is defined as a string and is expected to be either
      a URN, and Object Identifier or some equally unique identifier.

   Options  allows for a set of options to be specified for the policy.
      The set of options is dependent on the policy and only those
      clients which have pre-knowledge of a policy are expected to be
      able to deal with them.  The options can range from a simple
      yes/no selection to a list of strings.  An example of using
      options is provided by the basic policies defined in [TBD] where a
      set of RFC 822 names is provided.[anchor27]

   When building the wst:RequestSecurityTokenResponse element, the
   following should be noted:

      A wst:RequestedSecurityToken element containing the security token
      MUST be included.  The format of the security token is not
      specified and is implementation specific, it is not expected
      that[anchor28] .  Examples of items that could be used as security
      tokens are SAML statements, encrypted record numbers in a server
      database.

      A wst:Lifetime giving the life time of the token SHOULD be
      included.  It is not expected that this should be determinable
      from the token itself and thus must be independently provided.
      There is no guarantee that the token will be good during the
      lifetime as it make get revoked[anchor29] due to changes in
      credentials, however the client is permitted to act as if it were.
      The token provided may be used for duration.  If this element is
      absent, it should be assumed that the token is either a one time
      token or of limited duration.

8.  Sending An Email

   After having obtained a role token from a Plasma server, the client
   can then prepare to send an Email by requesting a message token from
   the Plasma server.  As part of the preparatory process, the client
   will construct the label to be applied to the Email from the set of
   policies that it can assert, determine the optional elements for
   those policies which have options, generate the random key encryption
   key and possible create the key recipient structures for the email.
   Although this section is written in terms of a CMS Encrypted message,
   there is nothing to prevent the specification of different formats
   and still use this same basic protocol.  An example of a request
   token exchange can be found in Appendix D.

8.1.  Send Message Request

   The send message request is built using the eps:PlasmaRequest XML
   structure.  When building the request, the following applies:

   o  The eps:Authentication element MAY be included in the initial
      message.  The authorization is supplied by the role token which is
      included in the data structure, however authentication may be
      required as well.  The authentication data is placed here.

   o  The xacml:Request element MUST be included in the initial message.

   o  The client MUST include an action attribute.  This document
      defines the action attribute to be used for purpose:

      Category = "urn:oasis:name:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:action"
      AttributeId="urn:ietf:plasma:action-id"
      Attribute Value= GetSendCMSToken

   o  The client MUST include a data attribute.  This attribute contains
      the information that is used to build the CMS Message token to be
      returned.  There MAY be more than one data attribute, but this
      will not be a normal case.  More details on this attribute are in
      Section 8.1.1.

   o  If the client is using the XML Digital Signature element in this
      message, then the client MUST include the cryptographic channel
      binding token (xref target="ChannelBind"/>) in the set of XACML
      attributes.

   The elements of the structure are used as:

   RoleToken  contains the previously issued role token which provides
      the authorization to use the policies in the label.

   Label  contains the label to be applied to the message.

   Recipients  is an optional element that contains one or more
      recipient info structures.

   KEK  is an optional element that contains the KEK to decrypt the CMS
      lock box.

   One or both of KEK and Recipients MUST be present.

   The elements of the RecipientInfoType structure are:

   Subject  contains a subject identifier.  Since a CMS recipient info
      structure does not contain a great deal of information about the
      recipient, this element contains a string which can be used to
      identify the subject.  This will normally be an RFC 822 name.
      Multiple subject names can be provided for a single lock box.
      This allows for the use a KEK value that is shared among the set
      of recipients but not the Plasma server.

   LockBox  contains a hex encoded CMS Recipient Info structure.  If the
      recipient info structure is placed here, it MUST NOT be placed in
      the CMS EnvelopedData structure as well.

8.2.  Send Message Response

   In response to a send message request, the Plasma server returns a
   send message response message.  The response messages uses the eps:
   PlasmaResponse XML structure.  When the response message is created,
   the following should be noted:

   o  The xacml:Decisions is always included in the response.  If the
      'Permit' value is returned then the eps:CMSToken element MUST be
      present.

   o  The eps:CMSToken element is included in a permit message.  It
      contains value of the keyatt-eps-kek attribute defined in
      [EPS-CMS].

   An example of a message returning the set of policy information is:

   is a the CMS SignedData structure that is the Plasma Key Attribute
   value to be encoded in the CMS KEKRecipientInfo structure (for
   details see [EPS-CMS]).

9.  Decoding A Message

   When the receiving agent is ready to decrypt the email, it identifies
   that there is a KEKRecipientInfo object which contains a key
   attribute identified by id-keyatt-eps-token.  It validates the
   signature, determines that communicating with the Email Policy
   Service is within local policy, and then sends a request to the
   service to obtain the encryption key for the message.

   In some cases the recipient of a message is not authorized to use the
   same set of labels for sending a message.  For this purpose a token
   can be returned in the message along with the key so that recipient
   of the can reply to the message using the same set of security
   labels.

9.1.  Requesting Message Key

   The client sends a request to the Plasma server that is identified in
   the token.  For the CMS base tokens, the address of the Plasma server
   to use is defined in [EPS-CMS] this is located in the aa-eps-url
   attribute.

   The request uses the eps:PlasmaRequest XML structure.  When building
   the request, the following should be noted:

   o  The xacml:Request MUST be present in the first message of the
      exchange.

   o  The action used to denote that a CMS token should be decrypted is:

      Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xaml:3.0:attribute-category:action"
      AttributeId="urn:ietf:plasma:action-id"
      Attribute Value: ParseCMSToken

   o  The CMS token to be cracked is identified by:[anchor30]

      Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-cateogry:data"
      AttributeId="urn:ietf:plasma:data-id"
      Attribute Value: CMSToken

   o  In the event that a reply to role token is wanted as well, then
      that is supplied as a separate action:

      Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xaml:3.0:attribute-category:action"
      AttributeId="urn:ietf:plasma:action-id"
      Attribute Value: GetReplyToken

Internet-Draft                  EPS TRUST                      June 2012


   o  If the client is using the XML Digital Signature element in this
      message, then the client MUST include the cryptographic channel
      binding token (xref target="ChannelBind"/>) in the set of XACML
      attributes.

   An example of a message returning the set of policy information is:

   <eps:PlasmaRequest>
     <eps:Authentication>...</eps:Authentication>
     <xacml:Request>
       <xacml:Attributes Category="...:action">
         <xacml:Attribute AttributeId="..:action-id">

         </xacml:Attribute>
       </xacml:Attribute>
     </xacml:Request>
   </eps:PlasmaRequest>

9.2.  Requesting Message Key Response

   In response to a message key request, the Plasma server returns a
   decrypted key in the message key response.  The response message uses
   the eps:Plasma XML structure.  When a response message is create the
   following should be noted:

   o  If the value of xacml:Decision is Permit, then response MUST
      include an eps:CMSKey element.

   o  For all other decision types the eps:CMSKey MUST be absent.

   o  If a reply token was requested and granted, then the response MUST
      include an eps:PlasmaToken element.  The eps:PlasmaToken element
      MUST use the Label option

10.  Plasma Attributes

   In this document a number of different XAMCL attributes have been
   defined, this section provides a more detailed description of these
   elements.

10.1.  Data Attributes

10.1.1.  Channel Binding Data Attribute

   The channel binding data attribute is used to provide for a binding
   of the TLS session that is being used to transport the Plasma
   messages with the content of the Plasma requests themselves.  There
   is a need for the server to be able to validate that the
   cryptographic operations related to holder of key statements be made
   specifically for the current conversation and not be left over from a
   previous one as a replay attack.  By deriving a cryptographic value
   from the shared TLS session key and signing that value we are able to
   do so.

   The channel binding value to be used is created by the TLS key
   exporter specification defined in RFC 5705 [RFC5705].  This allows
   for a new cryptographic value to be derived from the existing shared
   secret key with additional input to defined the context in which the
   key is being derived.  When using the exporter, the label to be input
   into the key exporter is "EXPORTER_PLASMA".  The value to be derived
   will be 512 bits in length, and no context is provided to the
   exporter.

   When used as an XACML attribute in a request:

      The category of the attribute is
      "urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:data".

      The AttributeId attribute is
      "urn:ietf:params:xml:plasma:data-id:ChannelBinding".

      The Issuer attribute is absent.

      The DataType is either base64Binary or hexBinary

   The same value is used for both the XACML channel binding data
   attribute and the XML channel binding structure defined in
   Section 5.1.3.

10.1.2.  CMS Signer Info Data Attribute

   In many cases a policy stays that the client is required to sign the
   message before encrypting it.  The server cannot verify that a
   signature is applied to the message and included, but we can require
   that a signature be supplied to the server.  This signature can then
   be validated by the server (except for the message digest attribute
   value), and the server can take a hash of the value and return it as
   part of the key returned to a decrypting agent.  This agent can then
   validate that the signature is a part of the message and complain if
   it absent.  This means we do not have an enforcement mechanism, but
   we do have a way of performing an audit at a later time to see that
   the signature operation was carried out correctly.

   By requiring that a signature be supplied to the server as part of
   the authentication process, the Plasma server can also be setup so
   that the supplied signature is automatically setup for archival
   operations.  One way to do archiving is to use the data records
   defined in [RFC4998].

   The following applies when this data value is present:

      The Category attribute is
      "urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:data".

      The AttributeId attribute is
      "urn:ietf:params:xml:plasma:data-id:CMSSignerInfo".

      The Issuer attribute is absent.

      The DataType attribute is either base64Binary or hexBinary.

10.1.3.  S/MIME Capabilities Data Attribute

   Policies sometimes require that specific algorithms be used in order
   to meet the security needs of the policy.  This attribute allows for
   an S/MIME Capabilities to be carried in a DER encoded
   SMIMECapabilities ASN.1 structure to be transmitted to the client.
   Details on how the S/MIME Capabilities function can be found in
   [SMIME-MSG].

   The following attributes are to be set for the data value:

      The Category attribute is
      "urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:data".

      The AttributeId attribute is
      "urn:ietf:params:xml:plasma:data-id:SMIME-Capabilties".

      The Issuer attribute is absent.

      The DataType attribute is either base64binary or hexBinary.

10.2.  Obligations and Advice

   Obligations and advice consist of actions that the Plasma server
   either requires or requests that the client PEP perform in order to
   gain access or before granting access to the data.  These normally
   represent actions or restrictions that the PDP itself cannot enforce
   and thus are not input attributes to the policy evaluation.  The same
   set of values can be used either as obligations or advice, the
   difference being that if the PEP cannot do an obligation it is
   required to change the policy decision.

10.2.1.  Signature Required

   Many policies require that a message be signed before it is encrypted
   and sent.  Since the unencrypted version of message is not sent to
   the Plasma server, the policy cannot verify that a signature has been
   placed onto the signed message.  The attribute is not for use as a
   returned obligation from an XACML decisions, rather it is for a pre-
   request obligations used in role responses (Section 7.2).

   When used as an Obligation:

      The ObligationId attribute is
      "urn:ietf:params:xml:plasma:obligation:signature-required".

      A S/MIME Capabilities data value can optionally be included.  If
      it is included, then it contains the set of S/MIME capabilities
      that describes the set of signature algorithms from which the
      signature algorithm for the message MUST be selected.

10.2.2.  Encryption Required

   Occasionally a policy requires a specific set of encryption
   algorithms be used for a message, when this is the case then the
   encryption required obligation is included in the returned set of
   obligations.  If the default set of encryption algorithms is
   sufficient then the obligation is omitted.

   When used as an Obligation:

      The ObligationId attribute is
      "urn:ietf:params:xml:plasma:obligation:encryption-required".

      An S/MIME Capabilities data value MUST be included containing the
      set of permitted encryption algorithms.  The algorithms included
      MUST include a sufficient set of algorithms for the message to be

      algorithm and key encryption algorithm.

12.  IANA Considerations

   We define the following name spaces

   New name space for the plasma documents urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:plasma

12.1.  Plasma Action Values

   A new registry is established for Plasma server action identifiers
   using the tag "action-id".  The full urn for the registry is
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:plasma:actions".  This registry operates
   under a specification required policy.  All entries in this registry
   require the following elements:

   o  A string in camel case which identifies the action to be
      performed.

   o  An optional XML data structure used to carry the control data for
      the action.

   o  An optional XML data structure used to return the result of the
      action from the server.

   o  A document reference describing the steps to be taken by the
      server.

   The registry will be initially populated with the following:

     +-----------------+-------------------------+------------------+
     | Action Id       | Input Structure         | Output Structure |
     +-----------------+-------------------------+------------------+
     | GetRoleTokens   | none                    | eps:RoleToken    |
     |                 |                         |                  |
     | GetSendCMSToken | eps:MessageTokenRequest | eps:CMSToken     |
     |                 |                         |                  |
     | ParseCMSToken   | eps:CMSToken            | eps:CMSKeyToken  |
     |                 |                         |                  |
     | GetReplyToken   | none                    | eps:RoleToken    |
     +-----------------+-------------------------+------------------+

   When these actions are placed in an xacml:Request,

   o  the Category is
      "urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:action",

   o  the AttributeId is "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:plasma:actions",

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:plasma:status.  The initial set of values is

   authentication-error  This identifier indicates that the
      authentication methods failed to successfully complete.

   Define a new name space for obligations.  The same namespace will be
   used both for obligations and for advice and the values may appear in
   either section.

   signature-required  This identifier indicates that that the encrypted
      body must contain a signature element.  The data value of this
      type shall be "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#hexBinary" and the
      data structure shall consist of a DER encoded CMSCapabilities
      structure [SMIME-MSG] with the list of permitted signature
      algorithms.  If there are no restrictions on the algorithms or the
      restriction is implicit, then the data value MAY be omitted.

   encryption-algorithms  see above

   ambigous-identity  The identity of the client is either not stated in
      a form the Plasma server understands, or there are multiple
      identities in the authentication data.  To remedy this situation,
      the client includes an explicit identity in the xacml:Reqeust
      element.

   We define a schema in appendix A at
   urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:plasma-RFCTBD

   Define a new Status Code for use in the Status URI field.

      urn:ietf:???:plasma:status:gss-api-response - This status is
      returned only with Indefinite responses.  Indicates a GSS-API
      response object was returned in the GSSAPIResponse token type.
      Will return until authentication has been completed.

13.  Open Issues

   List of Open Issues:

   o  JLS: URL definitions - do we need a new schema or do we just
      overload https?  For our URLs - do we require that they be passed
      through the internationalization step first?  Probably should
      since the locale information is on the server and the client might
      not agree.

   o  JLS: Should we require that any SignatureProperty be present for
      XML Signature elements?

   o  JLS: Need to figure out an appropriate way to reference the
      assertion from a dig sig element.  Could use a special version of
      RetrievalMethod with a transform, but that does not seem correct.
      May need to define a new KeyInfo structure to do it.

   o  JLS: Should X.509 certificates and attribute certificates be fully
      specified as an authentication method?

   o  JLS: Should a SignerInfo attribute be placed under the access-
      subject Category for a senders version and under Environment for a
      machine version?  Currently both are under Data

Editorial Comments

   [anchor7]   Trevor: I don't see Plasma using this type

   [anchor8]   Trevor: What about attribute match?

   [anchor9]   Trevor: This sounds like we ignore the mapping on the
               wire. There is no reason to mandate the mapping occurs
               inside the PDP.

   [anchor11]  Brian: Should one be able to create a policy on the fly
               for specific item where a set of attributes can be
               defined by the sender of the message.

   [anchor14]  jimsch: Remove this?

   [anchor16]  Trevor: What is the difference between WS-trust SAML
               assertions and the SAML assertions above?

   [anchor18]  Trevor: Would we use bearer tokens to reintroduce the
               client?  The main protection of bearer tokens is if they
               are fresh so you have had little time to stream one

   [anchor19]  trevor: Is this totally true?  Don't we need some kind of
               identifier so the server can indicate when the token can
               be replayed in a subsequence request?  E.g. give me these
               attributes or a foo token.

   [anchor20]  JLS: I don't know of any way to say use the asymmetric
               key that you authenticated with originally - can this be
               done?

   [anchor23]  Trevor: What about audit obligatiouns

   [anchor24]  Trevor: Should we ignore it if present?

   [anchor25]  JLS: I don't think we need to say anything about looking
               at it or ignoring it.  While it would be something for
               debugging, as a general rule the client does not care
               which policies where evaluated and passed to grant
               access.

   [anchor27]  JLS: I keep wondering if we need to define a set of
               minimal structures that can be used for options so that
               the entirety is not pushed off onto the client and server
               to parse and understand the structures.

   [anchor28]  Trevor: Something missing.

   [anchor29]  Trevor: did not think you have a revocation mechanism in
               SAML

   [anchor30]  jls: I need to think this case out a bit more - I want to
               be able to supply multiple CMS tokens at one time,
               however I am not sure if that is do able because if you
               get a success for one token and a deny for another token
               there is no way to handle that in the xacml:Response.

Appendix D.  Example: Get CMS Token Request

   This section contains an example of a request from a client to a
   server for a CMS message token to be issued.  The authentication for
   the request is provided by using a WS-Trust token previously issued
   as part of a role request/response dialog.  The request contains the
   following elements:

   o  A complex rule set is requested where permission to is to be
      granted to anyone who meets either of the two policies given.

   o  A specific recipient info structure is provided for a subject
      who's name is 'lisa@simpsons.com'.  The details of the recipient
      info structure are skipped but it would be any encoding of a
      RecipientInfo structure from CMS.

   o  A generic key encryption key is provided for any other subject who
      meets the policies specified.

Appendix H.  Enabling the MultiRequests option

   NOTE: RFC Editor please remove this section prior to publication.
   This section exists as a note to the author to make sure that it can
   be done.  It will be published as a separate document if desired.

   One of the issues in doing multiple requests in a single message is
   the issue of correlation between the request and the results.  We
   have make this issue even worse by the fact that we are return
   results that are not input attributes for the decision and that we
   are not returning as attributes of the decision.

   The best way to deal with this is by putting tags into the request
   and reflect them in the return values for the response.  The only
   place that this does not work is for the GSS-API response token as
   this element would normally be part of the response of multiple
   requests.  You want to finish that authentication step before issuing
   final decisions if the input is needed as part of that decision.

   With this in mind what we do is the following:

   o  Define a new data attribute for plasma as plasma-request-id.  The
      category for it is urn:...:data.  The type will be a string.

   o  When the new attribute is used, then the return attribute flag
      MUST be set on the attribute.

   o  There MUST be one entity of the new attribute, with a unique
      value, for each of the requests in the MultiRequest element.

   o  Exactly one of the new attributes MUST be referenced in each
      request in the MultiRequest element.

   o  The server copies the value of the attribute into the ***
      attribute of the returned token.

   We could probably relax the restrictions if we know that the token
   can only be returned by one request, however using the token to
   correlate the request and the decision is still probably desired so
   that those values can be correlated.
