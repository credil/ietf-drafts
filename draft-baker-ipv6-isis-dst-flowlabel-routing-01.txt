1.  Introduction

   This specification builds on IS-IS for IPv6 [RFC5308] and its
   extensible TLV.  This note defines the sub-TLV for an IPv6 [RFC2460]
   Flow Label, to define routes from to a destination prefix qualified
   by an authorization token.

   The approach may be combined with other qualifying attributes, such
   as routing "to that destination AND from a specified source".  The
   obvious application is data center inter-tenant routing using a form
   of token-based access control.  If the sender doesn't know the value
   to insert in the flow label or hop-by-hop option (the receiver's
   tenant ID), he in effect has no route to that destination.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Theory of Routing

   Both IS-IS and OSPF perform their calculations by building a lattice
   of routers and links from the router performing the calculation to
   each router, and then use routes (sequences in the lattice) to get to
   destinations that those routes advertise connectivity to.  Following
   the SPF algorithm, calculation starts by selecting a starting point
   (typically the router doing the calculation), and successively adding
   {link, router} pairs until one has calculated a route to every router
   in the network.  As each router is added, including the original
   router, destinations that it is directly connected to are turned into

   routes in the route table: "to get to 2001:db8::/32, route traffic to
   {interface, list of next hop routers}".  For immediate neighbors to
   the originating router, of course, there is no next hop router;
   traffic is handled locally.

   In this context, the route is qualified by an authorization token,
   carried in the flow label or a hop-by-hop option; It is installed
   into the FIB with the destination prefix, and the FIB applies the
   route if and only if the token in the packet matches the token in the
   route.  Of course, there may be multiple LSPs in the RIB with the
   same destination and differing authorization tokens; these may also
   have the same or differing next hop lists.  The intended forwarding
   action is to forward matching traffic to one of the next hop routers
   associated with this destination and authorization tokens, or to
   discard non-matching traffic as "destination unreachable".

   LSAs that lack an authorization tokens sub-TLV match any token that
   may be present, by definition.

2.1.  Dealing with ambiguity

   In any routing protocol, there is the possibility of ambiguity.  For
   example, one router might advertise a fairly general prefix - a
   default route, a discard prefix (which consumes all traffic that is
   not directed to an instantiated subnet), or simply an aggregated
   prefix while another router advertises a more specific one.  In
   source/destination routing, potentially ambiguous cases include cases
   in which the link state database contains two routes A->B' and A'->B,
   in which A' is a more specific prefix within the prefix A and B' is a
   more specific prefix within the prefix B.  Traditionally, we have
   dealt with ambiguous destination routes using a "longest match first"
   rule.  If the same datagram matches more than one destination prefix
   advertised within an area, we follow the route with the longest
   matching prefix.

   In this case, we follow a similar but slightly different rule; the
   FIB lookup MUST yield the route with the longest matching destination
   prefix that also matches the authorization token.  A FIB route with
   no such token matches any authorization token.

2.2.  Interactions with other constraints

   In the event that there are other constraints on routing, such as
   proposed in [I-D.baker-ipv6-isis-dst-src-routing], the effect is a
   logical AND.  The FIB lookup must yield the route with the longest
   matching destination prefix that also matches each of the
   constraints.

3.  Extensions necessary for IPv6 Authenticated Routing in IS-IS

   Section 2 of [RFC5308] defines the "IPv6 Reachability TLV", and
   carries in it destination prefix advertisements.  It has the
   capability of extension, using sub-TLVs.

   In this model, the flow label is used to prove that the datagram's
   sender has specific knowledge of its intended receiver.  No proof is
   requested; this is left for higher layer exchanges such as IPSec or
   TLS.  However, if the information is distributed privately, such as
   through DHCP/DHCPv6, the network can presume that a system that marks
   traffic with the right flow label has a good chance of being
   authorized to communicate with its peer.

   The key consideration, in this context, is that the flow label is a
   20 bit number.  As such, an advertised route requiring a given flow
   label value is calling for an exact match of all 20 bits of the label
   value.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The source prefix type mentioned in Section 3 must be defined.

5.  Security Considerations

   Network layer Token-based Access Control is part of a security
   solution.  It is not, in itself, a complete solution.  It acts as a
   pervasive network layer firewall, preventing unauthorized traffic
   from arriving at a destination.  However, as in any network, a host
   is its own last bastion of defense; it needs IPsec or TLS-style

   authorization and authorization of its peers, and must refuse traffic
   that contains the authorization token but is in fact malicious.
