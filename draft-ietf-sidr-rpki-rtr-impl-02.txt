                   RPKI Router Implementation Report
                    draft-ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr-impl-02

Abstract

   This document is an implementation report for the RPKI Router
   protocol as defined in [RFC6810].  The editor did not verify the
   accuracy of the information provided by respondents or by any
   alternative means.  The respondents are experts with the
   implementations they reported on, and their responses are considered
   authoritative for the implementations for which their responses
   represent.  Respondents were asked to only use the YES answer if the
   feature had at least been tested in the lab.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to
   be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] only when they
   appear in all upper case.  They may also appear in lower or mixed
   case as English words, without normative meaning.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

Internet-Draft     RPKI Router Implementation Report        January 2013


   In order to formally validate the origin ASs of BGP announcements,
   routers need a simple but reliable mechanism to receive RPKI
   [RFC6810] prefix origin data from a trusted cache.  The RPKI Router
   protocol defined in [RFC6810] provides a mechanism to deliver
   validated prefix origin data to routers.

   This document provides an implementation report for the RPKI Router
   protocol as defined in RFC 6810 [RFC6810].

   The editor did not verify the accuracy of the information provided by
   respondents or by any alternative means.  The respondents are experts
   with the implementations they reported on, and their responses are
   considered authoritative for the implementations for which their
   responses represent.  Respondents were asked to only use the YES
   answer if the feature had at least been tested in the lab.

   1) YES, but... fatal, so connection is dropped, but cache does not
   conclude it's inconsistent

   In particular we have tested our interoperability with rpki.net's
   RPKI Router implementation.

10.2.  Juniper Implementation

   Juniper: The Juniper Networks, Inc.  JUNOS implementation should be
   interoperable with other vendor RPKI Router Protocol implementations.

   rtr implementations.  In particular, we have tested our
   interoperability with Cisco IOS, Cisco IOS-XR, and Juniper.

10.4.  RIPE NCC Implementation

   RIPE NCC: The RIPE NCC validator has been tested by us with other
   rpki-rtr implementations.  In particular we have tested with RTRLib
   and CISCO IOS.  We received positive feedback from close contacts
   testing our validator with JUNOS and Quagga.

10.5.  RTRlib Implementation

   RTRlib: The RTRlib has been tested by us with other rpki-rtr
   implementations.  In particular, we have tested with rtr-origin from
   rpki.net and RIPE NCC Validator.

10.6.  BBN RPSTIR Implementation

   BBN RPSTIR: We have not yet tested with any other implementations.
