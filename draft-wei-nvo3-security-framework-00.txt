Internet-Draft           nvo3-security-framework               June 2012


1.  Introduction

   Security is one of important factors in the envrionment of cloud
   computing.  This issue should be addressed for the overlay based
   network virtualization, which supports multi-tenancy in data center.

   Security considerations have already been provided in each of the
   individual document on framework, control plane and data plane
   requirements of data center network virtualization over Layer
   3(NVO3).  [I-D.lasserre-nvo3-framework] describes that the tenant to
   overlay mapping function can introduce significant security risks if
   appropriate security mechanisms are not used for protocol.
   [I-D.kreeger-nvo3-overlay-cp] describes that the protocol should
   protect the integrity of the mapping, and overlay exposes virtual
   networks to attacks on the underlying network such as traffic
   injection.  [I-D.bitar-lasserre-nvo3-dp-reqs] also describes the
   security risks of the tenant to overlay mapping function.

   The motivation of this document is to provide a general and
   consistent security description for NVO3, and to complement with
   security considerations in the current documents.  This document is
   organized as follows.  Section 3 describes the security reference
   model for NVO3.  Section 4 describes the security threats under the
   security model.  Section 5 addresses the security requirements
   corresponding to the security issues.


2.  Terminology

   This document introduces no new terminology.  For reader's
   convenience, this document repeats some of them defined in
   [I-D.lasserre-nvo3-framework] [I-D.kreeger-nvo3-overlay-cp]
   [I-D.bitar-lasserre-nvo3-dp-reqs].

   Tenant End System(TES): An end system of a tenant, which can be for
   instance a virtual machine(VM), a non-virtualized server, or a
   physical appliance.  A TES attaches to Network Virtualization
   Edge(NVE) node.

   Network Virtualization Edge(NVE): An NVE implements network
   virtualization functions that allow for L2/L3 tenant separation,
   tenant-related control plane activity.  An NVE contains one or more
   tenant service instances whereby a TES interfaces with its associated
   instance.  The NVE also provides tunneling overlay functions.

   Virtual Network(VN): This is one of a virtual overlay network.  Two
   Virtual Networks are isolated from one another.

   Overlay Boundary Point(OBP): This is a network entity that is on the
   edge boundary of the overlay.  It performs encapsulation to send
   packets to other OBPs across Underling Network for decapsulation.

   Underlying Network(UN): This is the network that provides the
   connectivity between the OBPs.


3.  Security Reference Model

   This section defines security reference model for Overlay based
   Network Virtualization.

   The L3 overlay network provides virtual network to multi-tenants,
   which is deployed on the underlying network.  The tenant end system
   attaches to the L3 overlay network.

   L3 overlay network provides isolation to each tenant, which provides
   security to its tenant.  L3 overlay network can be regarded secure
   zone from the view of ONV3 operator.  Other components outside of the
   ONV3 are considered as untrusted, which may impose some attacks on
   the ONV3.  On the other hand, each virtual network may not trust
   other virtual network.  This model is the basis to analyze the
   security of ONV3.

4.  Security Threats

   This section describes the various security threats that may endanger
   overlay based network virtualization.  For example, an attack on ONV3
   may result in some unexpected effects:

   o  Interrupt the connectivity of tenant's virtual network.
   o  Inject some unwanted traffic into virtual network.
   o  Eavesdrop sensitive information from tenant.
   o  Degrade provider's service level.

   Security threats may be malicious or casual.  For example, some of
   them may come from the following sources:

   o  A tenant who rents one or more virtual networks may want to
      acquire some information from other tenants co-existed in the same
      data center.
   o  Some persons who manipulate the activation, migration or
      deactivation of tenant's virtual machine.

   o  Some persons who phyically access to underlying network.

4.1.  Attacks on Control Plane

   1.  Attack association between VM and VN: one of the functionalities
       of ONV3 is to provide virtual network to multi-tenants.  ONV3
       associates a virtual machine's NIC with corresponding virtual
       network, and maintain that association as the VM is activated,
       migrated or deactivated.  The signalling information between
       endpoint and access switch may be spoofed or altered.  Thus the
       association between VM and VN may be invalid if the signaling is
       not properly protected.
   2.  Attack the mapping of a virtual network: The mapping between the
       inter and outer addresses may be affected through altering the
       mapping table.
   3.  Inject traffic: The comprised underlying network may inject
       traffic into virtual network.
   4.  Attack live migration: An attacker may cause guest VMs to be live
       migrated to the attacker's machine and gain full control over
       guest VMs[VM-Migration].
   5.  Denial of Service attacks against endpoint by false resource
       advertising: for live migration are initiated automatically to
       distribute load across a number of servers, an attacker may
       falsely advertise available resources via the control plane.  By
       pretending to have a large number of spare CPU cycles, that
       attacker may be able to influence the control plane to migrate a
       VM to a compromised endpoint.

4.2.  Attacks on Data Plane

   1.  Unauthorized snooping of data traffic: This is attack results in
       leakage of sensitive information, an attacker can sniffer
       information from the user packets and extract their content.
   2.  Modification of data traffic: An attacker may modify, insert or
       delete data packets and impersonate them as legitimate ones.
   3.  Man-in-the-Middle attack on live migration of VM: When a virtual
       machine is migrated from one endpoint to another, the VM may be
       intercepted and modified in the middle of the migration.


5.  Security Requirements

   This section describes security requirements for control plane and
   data plane of NVO3.

Internet-Draft           nvo3-security-framework               June 2012


5.1.  Control Plane Security Requirements

   1.  The network infrastructure shall support mechanisms for
       authentication and integrity protection of the control plane.
       (1)When a protocol is used for the service auto-provisioning/
       discovery, the information from endpoint shall not be spoofed or
       altered. (2)When a protocol is used to distribute address
       advertisement and tunneling information, the protocol shall
       provide integrity protection. (3)The protocol for tunnel
       management shall provide integrity and authentication protection.
   2.  NVEs shall assure the information in the mapping table is coming
       from a trusted source.
   3.  The virtual network should prevent malformed traffic injection
       from underlying network, other virtual network, or endpoint.

5.2.  Data Plane Security Requirements

   1.  The mapping function from the tenant to overlay shall be
       protected.  NVEs should verify VNID is not spoofed.
   2.  The data plane should protect VM's state against snooping and
       tampering.
   3.  IPsec can provide authentication, integrity and confidentiality
       protection.  IPsec can be used to protect the data plane.
