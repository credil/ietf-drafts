1.  Introduction

   Our internet today employs a large and increasing number of devices
   with content aware ability.  These devices detect packet content of
   traffic flows rather than just packet headers, and perform specific
   functions using content information together with traditional
   information on layer 3 or layer 4.  Content information is used for
   various purposes: analyzing, optimizing, business, security, etc.
   Examples of functions utilizing content information include traffic
   visualizing, policy based control, content based charging, etc.

   Although content related information is vital in the smart operation
   of internet traffic and has already been widely referred to in the
   network, there is still not an effective, well defined method to
   export content information, especially in a standardized,
   interoperable way.

   The IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) working group has produced a
   series of specifications that help export flow information, including
   protocol [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol-rfc5101bis] and information model
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-information-model-rfc5102bis].  However, higher-layer
   content related information export is not yet well standardized.
   This document specifies Information Elements used to export content
   information.
