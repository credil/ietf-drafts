1.  Introduction

   VNEF allows service providers to operate multiple services
   independently on a common backbone network.  To see why this is
   required, let us walk through a few example use cases.

1.1.  Use Case 1: Operational Independence

   Network consolidation is increasingly becoming the norm in service
   provider networks.  This consolidation creates a common backbone
   infrastructure on which the service specific networks provide end-to-
   end service-level connectivity.  The services include native access
   services and packet based services such as Internet and Layer 3 VPNs.
   The consolidation provides numerous benefits, including higher
   utilization and cost savings in Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and
   Operational Expenditures (OPEX).  The model is described in Figure 1.


        __________                                __________
       / Service1 \                              / Service1 \
      |  Network   |                            | Network    |
       \----------/ \                         /  \----------/
                      \  __________________ /
                        /  Common backbone \
                       |   Network          |
                        \                  /
                      /  \----------------/ \
        __________  /                         \   __________
       / Service2 \                              / Service2 \
      |  Network   |                            | Network    |
       \----------/                              \----------/

                      Figure 1: Network Consolidation

   In many service providers, the migration of purpose-built service
   networks to the common core is a work-in-progress.  Additionally, the
   common backbone opens up the potential for a new business model,
   referred to as "network tenancy".  That is, the service provider
   instantiates a service dynamically on the common backbone and rents
   it out to the customer.

   As the number of such services carried on the common backbone
   continues to increase, it becomes desirable to create a level of
   network and operational isolation, much like what a dedicated network
   would have offered.  That is, each "service" operator expects to have
   an isolated virtual network on the backbone that can be managed
   independently.  This provides all the classic benefits of
   virtualization including efficiency, fast provisioning, and isolation



Kumaki, et al.           Expires August 22, 2013                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft   A Virtualized Network Element Framework   February 2013


   while maintaining the advantages of a common backbone network.

1.2.  Use Case 2: Network Redundancy

   Service providers want the ability to create multiple redundant
   networks to protect against failures.  Examples of such failures are
   severe protocol errors that melt down a majority of the network
   elements.  Redundancy allows the operator to switch the traffic from
   one network to the other.  It is worth noting that there have been
   attempts at building such redundancy through separate physical
   networks in the past, but that turns out to be expensive.

   As is clear from the use cases, there are two key aspects to VNEF:

   a.  An isolated environment on the network elements that can be
       operated independently per service ("Element Virtualization")

   b.  A virtualized network on the core physical network that can be
       operated independently per service ("Network Virtualization").

   In the following sections, we delve into these aspects of the
   framework and draw a set of key properties for each.  We recognize
   that there are multiple ways to "peel the onion".  As such, any
   reference to specific terminology describing a solution should be
   construed as an example.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

      Network Element: A routing and forwarding device in the service
      provider network.  Other terms used interchangeably for this:
      router, platform.

      Service: A term used to denote an autonomously administered entity
      (an organization, a department, a setup, or an application) that
      needs to run an independent network and that has a configured
      presence on a network element.  Other terms used interchangeably
      for this: router slice.

      Network slice: a virtual network implemented on the physical
      network and assigned to a particular service.  How it is
      implemented is not really that important.  For example, it can be

      constructed using network overlays.  What matter are the
      properties that it needs to provide, such as traffic isolation,
      quality of service.  These are discussed in the later sections.
      Other terms used interchangeabily for this: virtual network.

      Virtual Network Element Framework (VNEF): the architectural
      framework discussed in this document.

      Service ID: A field used to denote each service running on a
      network element.  One requirement of the service ID is to organize
      the forwarding tables per service and direct packets to the
      appropriate forwarding table for processing.

      VM: Virtual Machine


3.  Problem Statement and Related Areas

   Service providers need to consider the following properties of a
   common backbone network:

   Smooth migration and simple network:  Service providers want to
      consolidate many service networks into a new common backbone
      network without changing network topology and routing / signaling
      policy such as IGP, BGP and MPLS.

   Network scalability:  Routing and signaling protocols need to scale
      in proportion to the increase in the number of nodes and protocol
      sessions.

   Operational policy:  Service providers want to keep operational
      policy per each service network intact even if we consolidate many
      service networks into a new common backbone network.

   MTR [RFC4915], [RFC5120], [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology] allows
   service providers to keep network topology and routing / signaling
   policy such as IGP, BGP and MPLS intact.  However, this technology
   does not meet our requirements because 'service' network topologies
   may be completely different from the physical topology.  Actually, it
   depends on the services.  Moreover, MTR follows an intrusive design.
   That is, it does not provide a true separation of routing and
   signaling layers between different services (or a 'service' and the
   parent).  We refer to this design as the "vertical approach".

   Control plane protocols scale higher through hierarchical routing
   techniques - multi-area and multi-domain routing.  We refer to this
   design as the "horizontal approach".  These techniques alone do not
   meet our requirements because 'service' network topologies might be

   changed from the physical network topology.  Furthermore, in this
   approach, we can deploy carrier's carrier [RFC4364] to consolidate
   the service networks.  However, it's realistically difficult to
   enable MPLS-capable interfaces on the edge routers in the pure-IP ISP
   network.  Actually, we need to tranfer MPLS knowledge to operators
   and replace or upgrade the exsiting routers to MPLS-capable ones in
   the production networks.


4.  Reference Model

   VNEF's model of operation is depicted in Figure 2.

                            \____________/

                      Figure 2: Virtualized Networks

   A router slice is realized by the allocation of resources on the
   network element.  Similarly the network slice is realized through a
   network overlay-like mechanism across all the elements in the
   backbone network.  By virtue of separating the resources, the
   virtualized network maintains independent control plane, data plane,
   and management plane.  For example, a route modification by a network
   failure on the virtualized network of service 1 in Figure 2 does not
   affect the virtualized network of service 2.  Therefore, it is easy
   to assure different SLAs for service 1 and service 2.  After the
   implementation of virtualized network, there are many cases that the
   virtualized network runs out of allocated resources with the
   expansion of service scale.  Even in such case, VNEF provides the
   adaptive operation to service providers by allocating additional
   router resources to the starved virtualized network.

5.  Applications

5.1.  Network Wholesale Services

   Service providers want to provide a network resource (i.e. a network
   slice) to an ISP as shown in Figure 3.  In this case, the ISP1 have
   own network topology and AS.  Also, the ISP1 want to control and
   manage their network independently as they used to.

                        Service provider network 1

   This service provider have already provided the cloud service
   (service1),where they provide some applications to customers on the
   cloud network.  The ISP1 also can associate with the cloud platform
   on the cloud network.

5.2.  On-demand Network Services

   Some ISPs need a network resource (i.e. a network slice) during the
   specific time and period.  For instance, this service provider as
   shown in Figure 4 provides a network resource to the ISP1 permanently
   and a network resource to the ISP2 on demand.

6.  Requirement Details

6.1.  Dynamic binding - On-demand Service Creation

   The solution needs to provide the ability to create a new virtualized
   network on demand.  The virtualized network should be built
   dynamically.

6.2.  Control Plane/Routing Layer Separation

   The solution needs to support an independent control plane and
   routing layer per virtualized network.  The conventional routing/
   signaling protocols (such as OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, RSVP-TE) should be
   able to run on each control plane and routing layer in the
   virtualized network.

6.3.  Data Plane Separation

   The solution needs to have independent forwarding table and data
   plane mechanisms per virtualized network.  Each data plane on the
   virtualized network may be associated with physical interfaces or
   logical interfaces (such as VLAN or tunnel).

6.4.  Separate Operation of Services

   The solution needs to support independent operation of a virtualized
   network and service.  Administrators should be able to control
   routing/ signaling protocols depending on their policy, and manage

Internet-Draft   A Virtualized Network Element Framework   February 2013


   virtualized resources allocated to them (i.e.  CPU, Memory, and other
   platform resources).  Also, the virtualized networks should not
   affect each other in any way.

6.5.  QoS/SLA

   The solution needs to provide an independent QoS/SLA per virtualized
   network depending on a service level.  Each QoS on the virtualized
   network should support eight service levels at least.

6.6.  Load Balancing

   Each virtualized network may create multiple paths towards a
   destination (depending on the control plane algorithms running on the
   virtual network).  The network elements should support traffic load
   balancing, as they would do for a physical network.

6.7.  Scale

   The solution should scale well with consideration to at least the
   following metrics.

   1.  The number of virtualized networks

   2.  The number of nodes

   3.  The number of routes and MPLS LSPs on virtualized networks


7.  Architecture

   This section defines the VNEF architectural framework and the
   associated logical components.

7.1.  Element Virtualization

   Element virtualization is the mechanism to create an isolated
   environment per service on each network element running on the common
   backbone.  Virtual machine (VM) technology offers a way to implement
   element virtualization.  Essentially, multiples VMs are created on
   the platform by configuration.  Each VM represents a service, running
   its own operating system, routing protocols, management software, and
   other applications.  It also satisfies the requirement of independent
   software upgradeability per service.  Note that VMs are one way of
   providing element virtualization.  The implementation may choose to
   use another container strategy as long as the requirements are
   satisfied.

                     Figure 3: Element Virtualization

   Figure 3 describes the conceptual model for element virtualization.

   "Service Manager" operates as the "owner" software of all resources
   in the network element.  Its principal role is to arbitrate and
   manage the resources of the network element so that multiple service
   environments can run in parallel.  It responds to operator requests
   to create services, assign resources, and associate a set of physical
   or logical interfaces with each service.  In one particular
   implementation choice, the service manager spawns VMs for each
   service that is created by the service provider.  The creation of
   virtual networks per service is described in the next section.  For
   example, for network overlay model of building virtual networks, the
   service manager software acts as the server conduit that listens to
   requests from the service's software.

   The "service manager" also guarantees performance isolation between
   services.  If VMs are utilized to implement element virtualization,
   there are well-known resource allocation mechanisms to allocate CPU
   and memory per VM.  This needs to be configuration- driven so that
   the operator can deploy customized policies for resource allocation
   (e.g. proportional sharing or priviledged allocation for certain
   services).

7.2.  Network Virtualization

   Network virtualization is the mechanism to create independent virtual
   networks over the same physical network infrastructure.  The primary
   characteristics of virtual networks are:

   o  Each virtual network can be engineered and managed separately (by
      the operator of the corresponding service).  As an example, all
      routing protocols should be able to run on each virtual network to
      create the desired logical topology.

   o  Isolation of one service's traffic from other services.

   Virtual network constructs are not new (e.g.

   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-overlay-problem-statement] describes a few of the
   constructs).  We focus on network overlays to create virtual networks
   in this document.  More specifically, we will discuss a specific
   technology of a network overlay design using MPLS LSPs: GMPLS UNI
   ([RFC4208]).  The LSPs can either be created inline on the network
   element or as a separate layer ([RFC5440],
   [I-D.crabbe-pce-stateful-pce]).

   GMPLS UNI calls for a clean separation between the edge nodes and
   core nodes.  We find that suitable in the context of the interface
   between a service and the core network.  The reference model from
   [RFC4208] is reproduced here.

   The core network depicted as the large box in the center is the
   representation of the physical network.  The nodes marked as 'EN' and
   described as "Overlay Network" represent a single virtual network for
   a particular service.  In essence, the 'EN' nodes belong to a service
   (hosted by a virtualized network element as described in



Kumaki, et al.           Expires August 22, 2013               [Page 12]

   Section 7.1).  They request links to be established between them to
   the 'CN' nodes.  The links come up as GMPLS LSPs using the overlay
   signaling mechanism.  Collectively, the links between all the 'EN'
   nodes belonging to a service represent the topology of that service.
   The links show up as normal interfaces to the 'EN' nodes.  The 'EN'
   nodes can, thus, run normal routing protocols on the top to engineer
   the desired traffic forwarding paths.

7.3.  Service Identification

   When the network element receives a packet from the edge, how does it
   choose which service the packet belongs to?  There are a couple of
   design choices:

   1.  The edge-facing interfaces are associated with particular
       services by configuration.  This could be the entire physical
       interface or divided into multiple sub-interfaces (e.g.  VLANs)
       per service.

   2.  A per-service policy is configured to look at the packet
       attributes and dynamically identify a service.

   Similarly, when a packet is received from the core, the service is
   identified based on the virtual network that carried the packet.  For
   example, if GMPLS UNI LSPs are used as the virtual network construct,
   the top MPLS label identifies the LSP and hence the service.


8.  Comparison with Other Technologies

8.1.  VRF

   Most of the routers today support the concept of a virtual routing
   and forwarding (VRF) [RFC4364].  Though there are separate forwarding
   tables maintained per VRF, the technology fails to meet the
   requirements discussed in this document as follows:

      There is no operational isolation between different VRFs on a
      network element

      There is no network isolation (both for control plane and
      forwarding plane) on the core network between VRFs.

8.2.  Network Virtualization Over L3

   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-overlay-problem-statement] describes an architectural
   requirement for virtualizing the network.  However, it focuses
   primarily on data center and multi- tenancy and the requirements do

   not apply to service provider networks.
