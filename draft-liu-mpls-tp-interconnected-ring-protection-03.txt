              MPLS-TP protection for interconnected rings
          draft-liu-mpls-tp-interconnected-ring-protection-03

Abstract

   The requirements for MPLS Transport Profile include a requirement
   (R93) that requires that MPLS-TP must support recovery mechanisms for
   a network constructed from interconnected rings that protect user
   data that traverses more than one ring.  In particular, this includes
   protecting against cases of failure at the ring interconnect nodes
   and links.  This document presents different configurations of
   interconnected rings and special mechanisms to address the recovery
   of ring-interconnect nodes and links. .

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
   Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
   Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include
   an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
   to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
   network as defined by the ITU-T.

Internet-Draft    MPLS-TP protection of interconnection     October 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document describes different interconnected ring scenarios and a
   few special solutions to protect against the failure of the ring-
   interconnect nodes and links. there are three common interconnection
   scenarios that we will address in this document:

   Dual-node interconnection - when the two rings are interconnected by
   two nodes from each ring (see Figure 1);

   Single-node interconnection - when the connection between the two
   rings is through a single node (see Figure 2).As the interconnnection
   node(LSR-A) is a single-point of failure, This configuration should
   be avoided in real networks;

   Chained interconnection - when a series of rings are connected
   through interconnection nodes that are part of both interconnected
   rings (see Figure 3)

   Regarding traffic that traveres more than two rings. many
   interconnection scenarios could be existed in the same scenario, they
   will be mixed interconnection scenario:

   Dual-node and single-node mixed interconnection- when there exist a
   multi-ring traffic which traveres more than two ring. two of these
   rings are dual-node interconnection. while another two are single-
   node interconnection (see figure 5);

   Dual-node and chained mixed interconnection-when there exist both
   dual-node interconnection and chained interconnection in this
   scenario (see figure 4);

   single-node and chained mixed interconnection-when there exist both
   single-node interconnection and chained interconnection in this
   scenario(see figure 6);

   Dual-node, single-node and chained mixed interconnection-when there
   exist all three interconnection scenrios in this scenario including
   Dual-node interconnnection, single-node interconnection and chained
   interconnnection( see figure 7);

   For a multi-ring traffic, it will be across more than one ring just
   like above seven scenarios. if a failure happens on a multi-ring
   path, quick recovery is necessary requirement for multi-ring traffic.

3.  recovery mechanism

   In the following subsections we propose different mechanisms that may
   be applied for traffic recovery in the different interconnection
   scenarios.  In general, it is possible to provide protection against
   the failure of a ring node/link by using the single-ring protection
   mechanism.  These cases are out of scope for this document.  It is
   also possible to configure an end-to-end protection to protect the
   entire working path across all of the interconnected rings.  However,
   this protection scheme does not scale very well.  Therefore, we need
   to consider special mechanisms to address recovery from failures of
   the interconnecting nodes and links

3.1.  recovery mechanism for Dual-node interconnection

   Under this scenario , when interconnection link(LSRA-LSR6) has a
   failure as shown in figure 8. it is possible use 1:1 linear
   protection mechanism to protect the failure of segment(LSRA-LSR6) by
   using one of the protection paths (LSRA-LSRF-LSR5-LSR6 or LSRA-LSRF-
   LSR6 or LSRA-LSR5-LSR6) .

   When the interconnection node(LSRA or LSR6) detects a SF or SD on the
   interconnection link(LSRA-LSR6), LSRA or LSR6 will send SF or SD
   failure message to its peer node.  Then it switchs the multi-ring
   traffic from the working path to its corresponding protection path to
   another end point(LSRA or LSR6) of the segment . when the peer node
   (LSR6 or LSRA) receives the traffic packet from its protection

   protection path, it will POP the outer label of protection tunnel and
   return back to the original working tunnel(LSRA-LSRB-LSRC or LSR6-
   LSR1-LSR2) of another ring(ring 1 or ring 2) to transport the multi-
   ring traffic.

   when interconnection node(LSRA or LSR6) has a failure as shown in
   figure 9. the end node of the segment detects the failure of the
   interconnection node, it should send failure messge to the backup
   interconnection node(LSRF or LSR5) to active the protection path that
   goes to the backup interconnection node(LSRF or LSR5) to trasnport
   the multi-ring traffic. at the same time, the backup interconnection
   node should active its corresponding protection path that goes to
   another primary interconnection node(LSR6 or LSRA).Then the multi-
   ring traffic should return back to the original working path to be
   transported in another primary interconnection node..

   for example , LSRC detects a failure on the interconnection node
   LSRA. it will send the failure message to notify the backup
   interconnection node LSRF to switch over to the protection path(LSRC-
   LSRD-LSRE-LSRF) to transport the multi-ring traffic.at the same time,
   LSRF should active its corresponding protection path that goes to
   another primary interconnection node LSR6 to transport the multi-ring
   traffic.The corresponding protection path may be one of the two
   paths(LSRF-LSR5-LSR6 or LSRF-LSR6).  Then the multi-ring traffic will
   be transported by its original working path(LSR6-LSR1-LSR2) to the
   exit node LSR2.

3.2.  recovery mechanism for Chained interconnection

   For this scenario , when only a failure is detected on the
   interconnection link.  Since the failure should not affect the multi-
   ring traffic. no action is taken. when a failure happens on the
   segment of the multi-ring path just as shown in figure 10.  The end
   node of the segment detects the failures, it will active the
   protection path that goes to the backup interconnection node to
   transport the multi-ring traffic.  After the backup interconnection
   node receives the failure message , it will active its corresponding
   protection path that goes to the exit node of another ring to
   trasnport the multi-ring traffic.

                                 Figure 10


   for example, there are failures on both link(LSRC-LSRB) and (LSRA-
   LSRF) at the same time as shown in figure.10. when LSRC detects or is
   notified of the failures on both the segment of the working path and
   the interconnection link. so it will send a failure message to the
   backup interconnection node LSRF, Then LSRF will active its
   corresponding protection path(LSRF-LSR4-LSR3-LSR2) of ring 2 to
   transport the multi-ring traffic.
