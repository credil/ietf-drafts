 Using PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH) as a Prooftype for XMPP Domain Name
                              Associations
                  draft-miller-xmpp-posh-prooftype-01

Abstract

   This document defines a prooftype involving PKIX over Secure HTTP
   (POSH) for associating a domain name with an XML stream in the
   Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  It also defines a
   method involving HTTPS redirects (appropriate for use with the POSH
   prooftype) for securely delegating a source domain to a derived
   domain in XMPP.

Internet-Draft             XMPP POSH Prooftype                 July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The [XMPP-DNA] specification defines a framework for secure
   delegation and authenticated domain name associations (DNA) in the
   Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  This document
   defines a prooftype for DNA, using PKIX certificates obtained over
   secure HTTP ("POSH"), as well as a secure delegation method, based on
   HTTPS redirects, that is appropriate for use with the POSH prooftype.

   The rationale for POSH is driven by current operational realities.
   It is effectively impossible for a hosting service to provide and
   maintain PKIX certificates [RFC5280] that include the appropriate
   [RFC6125] identifiers for each hosted domain.  It is true that DNS-
   based technologies are emerging for secure delegation, in the form of
   DNS Security [RFC4033] and [DANE]); however, these technologies are
   not yet widely deployed and might not be deployed in the near future
   for domains outside the most common top-level domains (e.g., ".COM",
   ".NET", ".EDU").  Because the XMPP community wishes to deploy secure
   delegation and authenticated domain name associations as widely and
   as quickly as possible, this document specifies how to use secure
   HTTP [RFC2616] and PKIX certificates [RFC5280] to verify that a
   domain is delegated to a hosting provider and authenticate an
   assocation between a domain name and an XML stream.


2.  Terminology

   This document inherits XMPP-related terminology from [RFC6120] and
   security-related terminology from [RFC5280].  The terms "source
   domain", "derived domain", "reference identifier", and "presented
   identifier" are used as defined in the "CertID" specification
   [RFC6125].

   This document is applicable to connections made from an XMPP client
   to an XMPP server ("_xmpp-client._tcp") or between XMPP servers
   ("_xmpp-server._tcp").  In both cases, the XMPP initiating entity
   acts as a TLS client and the XMPP receiving entity acts as a TLS
   server.  Therefore, to simplify discussion this document uses "_xmpp-
   client._tcp" to describe both cases, unless otherwise indicated.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft             XMPP POSH Prooftype                 July 2012


3.  Prooftype

   POSH stands for PKIX Over Secure HTTP: the verification materials
   consist of a PKIX certificate [RFC5280], they are obtained by
   retrieving the certificate over HTTPS [RFC2818] from a well-known URI
   [RFC5785], the certificate is checked according to the rules from
   [RFC6120] and [RFC6125], and secure DNS is not necessary since the
   HTTPS retrieval mechanism relies on the chain of trust based on the
   public key infrastructure.

   The process for retrieving a PKIX certificate over secure HTTP is as
   follows.

   1.  The initiating entity performs an HTTPS GET at the source domain
       to the path "/.well-known/posh._<service>._tcp.cer"; where
       "_<service>" MUST be either "_xmpp-client" for XMPP client-to-
       server connections or "_xmpp-server" for XMPP server-to-server
       connections:

   HTTP GET /.well-known/posh._xmpp-server._tcp.cer HTTP/1.1
   Host: im.example.com


   2.  If the source domain HTTPS server has a certificate for the
       requested path, it MUST respond with a success status code, with
       the message body as the DER certificate (optionally encoded as
       base64 [RFC4684]) that the XMPP server at the source domain will
       present during the TLS negotiation phase of XMPP stream setup:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/pkix-cert
   Content-Length: 839

4.  Secure Delegation

   When PKIX Over Secure HTTP (POSH) is the DNA prooftype, it is
   possible to use HTTPS redirects in determining if a domain is
   securely delegated, as follows:

   1.  The initiating entity performs an HTTPS GET at the source domain
       to the path "/.well-known/posh._<service>._tcp.cer"; where
       "_<service>" MUST be either "_xmpp-client" for XMPP client-to-
       server connections or "_xmpp-server" for XMPP server-to-server
       connections.  Here is an example:

   GET /.well-known/posh._xmpp-server._tcp.cer HTTP/1.1
   Host: im.example.com


   2.  If the source domain HTTPS server has delegated to a derived
       domain, it MUST respond with one of the redirect mechanisms
       provided by HTTP (e.g., using the 302, 303, or 307 response).
       The 'Location' header MUST specify an HTTPS URL, where the
       hostname and port is the derived domain HTTPS server, and the
       path MUST match the pattern "_<service>._tcp.cer"; where
       "_<service>" MUST be identical to the "_<service>" portion of the
       original request (line breaks added for readability):

   HTTP/1.1 302 Found
   Location: https://hosting.example.net/.well-known
             /posh._xmpp-server._tcp.cer


   3.  The initiating entity performs an HTTPS GET to the URL specified
       in the 'Location' header:

   GET /.well-known/posh._xmpp-server._tcp.cer HTTP/1.1
   Host: hosting.example.net


   4.  If the derived domain HTTPS server has a certificate, it MUST
       respond with a success status code, with the message body as the
       DER certificate (optionally encoded as base64 [RFC4684]) that the
       XMPP server at the derived domain will present during the TLS
       negotiation phase of XMPP stream setup:

   -----END CERTIFICATE-----



5.  Caching Results

   Ideally, the initiating entity relies on the expiration time of the
   certificate obtained via POSH, and not on HTTP caching mechanisms.
   To that end, the HTTPS servers for source and derived domains SHOULD
   specify a 'Cache-Control' header indicating a short duration (e.g.,
   max-age=60) or "no-cache" to indicate the response (redirect or
   content) is not appropriate to cache at the HTTP level.


6.  Examples

   Detailed examples will be provided in a future version of this
   specification.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document supplements but does not supersede the security
   considerations provided in [RFC2616], [RFC2818], [RFC6120], and
   [RFC6125].

   Specifically, communication via HTTPS depends on checking the
   identity of the HTTP server in accordance with [RFC2818].
