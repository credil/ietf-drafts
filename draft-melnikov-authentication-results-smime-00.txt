1.  Introduction

   [RFC5451] specifies the Authentication-Results header field for
   conveying results of message authentication checks.  This document
   defines a new authentication method to be used in the Authentication-
   Results header field for S/MIME related signature checks.

   [[Explain in more details use cases, such as a border MTA performing
   check and MUA showing results.]]

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The formal syntax uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] notation including the core rules defined in Appendix B of
   RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

3.  "smime" Authentication Method

3.1.  S/MIME Results

   The result values used by [RFC5751] are as follows:

   +-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
   | Result code | Meaning                                             |
   +-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
   | none        | The message was not signed.                         |
   |             |                                                     |
   | pass        | The message was signed, the signature or signatures |
   |             | were acceptable to the verifier, and the            |
   |             | signature(s) passed verification tests.             |
   |             |                                                     |
   | fail        | The message was signed and the signature or         |

   |             | signatures were acceptable to the verifier, but     |
   |             | they failed the verification test(s).               |
   |             |                                                     |
   | policy      | The message was signed but the signature or         |
   |             | signatures were not acceptable to the verifier.     |
   |             |                                                     |
   | neutral     | The message was signed but the signature or         |
   |             | signatures contained syntax errors or were not      |
   |             | otherwise able to be processed.  This result SHOULD |
   |             | also be used for other failures not covered         |
   |             | elsewhere in this list.                             |
   |             |                                                     |
   | temperror   | The message could not be verified due to some error |
   |             | that is likely transient in nature, such as a       |
   |             | temporary inability to retrieve a public key.  A    |
   |             | later attempt may produce a final result.           |
   |             |                                                     |
   | permerror   | The message could not be verified due to some error |
   |             | that is unrecoverable, such as a required header    |
   |             | field being absent.  A later attempt is unlikely to |
   |             | produce a final result.                             |
   +-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+


   A signature is "acceptable to the verifier" if it passes local policy
   checks (or there are no specific local policy checks).  For example,
   a verifier might require that the signature(s) on the message be
   added using the DNS domain present in the From: header field of the
   message, thus making third-party signatures unacceptable.  [RFC5751]
   advises that if a message fails verification, it should be treated as
   an unsigned message.  A report of "fail" here permits the receiver of
   the report to decide how to handle the failure.  A report of
   "neutral" or "none" preempts that choice, ensuring the message will
   be treated as if it had not been signed.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the the following entries to the "Email
   Authentication Methods" subregistry of the "Email Authentication
   Parameters" registry:

   +--------+-----------+--------+------------------+------------------+
   | Method | Defined   | ptype  | property         | value            |
   +--------+-----------+--------+------------------+------------------+
   | smime  | [RFC5751] | body   | smime-part       | The MIME body    |
   |        |           |        |                  | part reference   |
   |        |           |        |                  | which contains   |
   |        |           |        |                  | the signature.   |
