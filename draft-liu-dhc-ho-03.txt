Internet-Draft   HO from 3GPP to trusted non-3GPP access   February 2013


1.  Introduction

   In 3GPP TS 23.402, 3GPP EPS supports the use of non-3GPP IP access
   networks to access the EPC, and also supports handover between 3GPP
   and non-3GPP access.

   This document describes DHCP client and server behavior in a scenario
   for handover from 3GPP to a trusted non-3GPP access.

3.  Problem Statement

   During handover from 3GPP to a non-3GPP access, UE IP address
   allocated by 3GPP network needs be reused after handover to non-3GPP
   access in order to keep UE service continuous.  For non-3GPP access,
   it needs to know UE capability for the IP address preservation, and
   in 3GPP TS 23.402, the information can be gotten from IKEv2
   authentication procedure for untrusted non-3GPP access, however, a
   method how the trusted non-3GPP access get UE capability for the IP
   address preservation isn't described explicitly shown as follows.

             Figure 1: Handover from 3GPP to a non-3GPP access

   From above figure, the step 4 is involved for the problem, the
   description is as follows.Step 4: After successful authentication and
   authorization, the L3 attach procedure is triggered.  At the latest,
   in this step, the UE should indicate its capability for the IP
   address preservation.  How this information is signalled from the UE

   to the access network is outside of the scope of 3GPP.

   From step 4 description, it is considered that the capability for the
   IP address preservation must be transferred to Trusted Non-3GPP IP
   Access in step 4, if this information hasn!_t been transferred before
   step 4.  For the capability for the IP address preservation, it
   indicates UE need to reuse the previously assigned address.

   Currently, DHCP message, especially for IPv4 type, is considered of
   preferred method for triggering Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access to access
   3GPP EPC, and UE is integrated with DHCP client and trusted non-3GPP
   access is integrated with DHCP server.  And then, DHCP messages need
   to support to transfer UE capability for the IP address preservation
   from UE to Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access.

3.1.  DHCPv4 Requirement

   In RFC2131 section 3.2, there are procedures for Client-server
   interaction - reusing a previously allocated network address, in the
   procedures shown as follow figure, DHCP client in INIT-REBOOT state
   sends DHCPREQUEST message to DHCP server, where 'requested IP
   address' option must be filled in with client's notion of its
   previously assigned address, 'ciaddr' MUST be zero and 'server
   identifier' MUST NOT be filled in, and the server will return DHCP
   ACK message to the client.

   If above procedure is applied for the scenario of handover from 3GPP
   to a trusted non-3GPP access, DHCP server can implicitly get the
   capability for the IP address preservation by detecting the
   parameters in received DHCPREQUEST message.  But the requirement for
   DHCP client and DHCP server behavior in this specific scenario isn!_t
   included in RFC2131 and needs to be described in more detailed than
   one of RFC2131.

3.2.  DHCPv6 Requirement

   In RFC3315, there is following description associated with handover
   scenario, for example, in any situation when a client may have moved
   to a new link, the client must initiate a Confirm/Reply message



Liu, et al.              Expires August 20, 2013                [Page 8]

   exchange.  The client includes any IAs assigned to the interface that
   may have moved to a new link, along with the addresses associated
   with those IAs, in its Confirm message. in its Any responding servers
   will indicate whether those addresses are appropriate for the link to
   which the client is attached with the status in the Reply message it
   returns to the client.  If confirm message is applied for the
   scenario of handover from 3GPP to a trusted non-3GPP access, DHCP
   server can implicitly get the capability for the IP address
   preservation if receiving confirm message and get previously
   allocated IP address from confirm message.  But the requirement for
   DHCP client and DHCP server behavior in this specific scenario isn!_t
   included in RFC3315 and needs to be described in more detailed than
   one of RFC3315.  This document is intended to describe DHCP client
   and server behavior in specific scenario for handover from 3GPP to a
   trusted non-3GPP access.

4.  DHCP Client Behavior

4.1.  DHCPv4 Protocol

   When UE decides to handover from 3GPP to a non-3GPP access, UE will
   notify DHCP client move to INIT-REBOOT state, and DHCP client sends
   DHCPREQUEST message to DHCP Server, and the included parameters refer
   to the description for 'DHCPREQUEST generated during INIT-REBOOT
   state' in RFC2131 section 4.3.2.

   Subsequently, the client receives the DHCPACK message with
   configuration parameters.  The client performs a final check on the
   parameters and notes the duration of the lease specified in the
   DHCPACK message, more detailed description refer to 'DHCPREQUEST
   generated during INIT-REBOOT state' in RFC2131.

4.2.  DHCPv6 Protocol

   When UE decides to handover from 3GPP to a non-3GPP access, UE will
   notify DHCP client to send confirm message to DHCP Server, and the
   included parameters refer to the description for 'Creation and
   Transmission of Confirm Messages' in RFC3315 section18.1.2.

   Subsequently, the client receives the Reply message with
   configuration parameters.  The client SHOULD perform duplicate
   address detection on each of the addresses in any IAs it receives in
   the Reply message before using that address for traffic, more
   detailed description refer to 'Receipt of Reply Messages' in RFC3315
   section 18.1.8.

5.  DHCP Server Behavior

5.1.  DHCPv4 Protocol

   WDHCP server receives DHCPREQUEST message from DHCP client and deal
   with the message, if the 'server identifier' isn!_t be filled in,
   'requested IP address' option is filled in with client's notion of
   its previously assigned address. 'ciaddr' is zero, which corresponds
   to the requirements of 'DHCPREQUEST generated during INIT-REBOOT
   state' in RFC2131, then DHCP server will notify trusted non-3GPP
   access to send PMIP or GTP message to 3GPP PDN GW, which includes
   handover indication for reusing a previously allocated network
   address.

   Subsequently, when trusted non-3GPP access receives the response
   message from PDN GW, it will notify DHCP server to respond with a
   DHCPACK message to the client, whose format and requirement refer to
   the description for 'Table 3: Fields and options used by DHCP
   servers' in RFC2131.

5.2.  DHCPv6 Protocol

   DHCP server receives confirm message from DHCP client and deal with
   the message, if the parameters match the requirements of 'Receipt of
   Confirm Messages' in RFC3315 section 18.2.2, then DHCP server will
   notify trusted non-3GPP access to send PMIP or GTP message to 3GPP
   PDN GW, which includes handover indication for reusing a previously
   allocated network address.

   Subsequently, when trusted non-3GPP access receives the response
   message from PDN GW, it will notify DHCP server to respond with a
   Reply message to the client, whose format and requirement refer to
   the description for 'Transmission of Reply Messages' in RFC3315
   section18.2.8.
