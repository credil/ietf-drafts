   Extending the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for TRILL campus
                   draft-hu-trill-rbridge-vrrp-02.txt

Abstract

   TRILL can be implemented in data center networks, which requires high
   reliability and stability.  Whenever the egress RBridges or links
   break down, the TRILL rerouting time depends on the IS-IS topology
   convergence time, which may do not meet data center service
   requirements in terms of resiliency.  VRRP provides a redundancy
   mechanism to avoid single point of failure and fast switching over.
   This draft proposes to extend VRRP protocol to TRILL in data center
   networks.

Internet-Draft               VRRP For TRILL                     Dec 2011


1.  Introduction

   TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) provides optimal
   pair-wise data forwarding without configuration, safe forwarding even
   during periods of temporary loops, and support for multi-pathing of
   both unicast and multicast traffic[RFC6325].  TRILL is designed to
   replace STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) for data center networks.The
   IS-IS routing protocol is used as a control plane protocol to
   discover the topology and advertise link states.  When the topology
   changes, IS-IS LSPs flood the link state information to other
   adjacencies.  The topology convergence time can go up to about dozens
   of seconds for particular data center topologies, which may do not
   meet data center service requirements.

   VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) specifies an election
   protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router
   to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN in IP network.  There is one
   master equipment and one or several backup equipments in a VRRP
   group.  The VRRP group looks like one equipment from the host side.
   This document is to extend VRRP to support nickname namespace and
   apply the VRRP protocol in TRILL network.  VRRP is used to solve the
   single of point failure of edge equipment, and fast the switching
   over time by avoiding topology changed in TRILL campus network.
   There is a VRRP group including one master BRB(Border RBridge) and
   one or several backup BRBs in the TRILL edge network.  When the
   master BRB is failed, one of the backup BRB takes the role of master
   in the VRRP group.  The master BRB floods the virtual nickname in
   TRILL campus network.  The other RBridges doesn't feel the change of
   master and the ISIS topology doesn't change.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows: Sction 3
   describes the VRRP application scenarios.  There are two application
   scenarios introduced in the document.  Section 4 specifics the TRILL
   VRRP frame structure and encapsulation.  The TRILL VRRP frame is
   encapsulated as the payload of Ethernet Frame.  There is new type
   "L2-TRILL-VRRP" Ethertype to identify the TRILL VRRP frame.  Section
   5 specifics the VRRP frame fields in details.  Section 6 describes
   the VRRP protocol state machine.  Section 7 describes IS-IS adjacency
   when deployed VRRP protocol in the RBridges.


2.  Terminology

   Border RBridge: Abbr.BRB, a device locates the border of TRILL campus
   and runs TRILL protocol, BRB is used to communicate with other TRILL
   campus

   VRRP RBridge: an RBridge running the Virtual Router Redundancy

   Protocol.  It may participate in one or more VRRP groups.

   Virtual RBridge: An abstract object managed by VRRP that acts as a
   default RBridge for devices on a shared LAN.  It consists of a
   Virtual System Identifier and a set of associated nickname (s) across
   a common LAN.  A VRRP RBridge may backup one or more virtual
   RBridges.

   Nickname Owner:The VRRP RBridge that has the virtual RBridge's
   nickname as one of its nickname addresses.  This is the RBridge that,
   when up, will respond to packets addressed to one of these nickname
   addresses for ICMP pings, TCP connections, etc.

   Virtual RBridge master:The VRRP RBridge that is assuming the
   responsibility of forwarding packets sent to the nickname associated
   with the virtual RBridge, and answering ARP requests for these
   nickname.  Note that if the nickname owner is available, then it will
   always become the Master.

   Virtual RBridge backup:The set of VRRP RBridge available to assume
   forwarding responsibility for a virtual RBridge should the current
   Master fail.


3.  Application Scenario

   Figure 1 is a data center application scenario.  BRB is the edge of
   data center and the exit RBridge for the VLAN.  In order to improve
   the reliability, BRB2 is the backup of BRB1 for the VLAN.  If BRB1 is
   broken, RB1 and RB2 recalculate the route, and BRB2 becomes the exit
   RBridge for the VLAN.  RB1 and RB2 should flush the new LSP in the
   network.  It takes more than several seconds to switch data traffic
   from BRB1 to BRB2, which is not satisfied to the current data center
   video traffic.  In addition, if the physical connection between RT1
   and BRB1 is broken, RB1 can not feel the failure.

   This document proposes to apply VRRP for ensure fast BRB switching
   upon failure.  The VRRP mechanism can guarantee a sub-second (less
   than 50ms) switching time to ensure video data [VRRPv3].  Master BRB
   and backup BRBs are configured as belonging to a same VRRP group with
   the same virtual system ID and virtual nickname.  The master BRB of
   the group floods the virtual nickname to adjacencues.  If the Master
   BRB becomes unavailable, then the highest priority Backup BRB will be
   elected as Master after a short delay, providing a controlled
   transition of the virtual RBridge responsibility with minimal service
   interruption, and the Master BRB elected floods Link State Packets
   (LSPs) and is responsible for data forwarding in TRILL campus
   network, and the content of LSPs and the IS-IS link state topology

   doesn't change.

   In addition, two VRRP groupes can be configured in the BRBs, one
   group is used to down link, and the other is used to up link.  The
   two VRRP groupes can be linkage: Once a VRRP group switches over the
   master,the other VRRP group will switch over the master BRB too.  The
   physical connection between RT1 and RBR1 is broken, the up VRRP group
   switches the master to BRB2, and notifies the down link VRRP group to
   switch BRB2 too.

   Figure 2 is multi-level TRILL deployment scenario.  It is
   recommedated that there is only one BRB in the border of two levels.
   The BRB becomes the bottleneck of TRILL network in case of failure,
   and is very easy to create such a single point of failure.  Extension
   of VRRP can improve the reliability of BRB and avoiding the single
   point of failure.

4.  TRILL VRRP Frames

   By multicasting periodically a TRILL VRRP frame, a master RBridge
   announces its existence and functionality to the backup RBridge(s) in
   a VRRP group.  If none TRILL VRRP frame is received in a certain
   time, backup RBridge(s) will consider the master unavailable and
   trigger a new master RBridge election process.

   A TRILL VRRP frame on an 802.3 link is structured as figure 3.  All
   such frames are Ethertype encoded.  The RBridge port out which such a
   frame is sent will strip the outer VLAN tag if configured to do so.

   The TRILL-VRRP multicast address is an IP-derived multicast MAC
   address.  The IP address is:

   224.0.0.18

   The IP-derived multicast address is a link local scope multicast
   address.  RBridges MUST NOT forwards a frame with this destination
   address to another link.

   It is a MAC address of RBridge port out which this TRILL VRRP frame
   is sent

4.3.  L2-TRILL-VRRP Ethertype

   It is used to indicate that the payload in the frame is a TRILL VRRP
   packet

4.4.  Frame Check Sequence (FCS)

   Each Ethernet frame has a single Frame Check Sequence (FCS) that is
   computed to cover the entire frame, for detecting frame corruption
   due to bit errors on a link.  Thus, when a frame is encapsulated, the
   original FCS is not included but is discarded.  Any received frame
   for which the FCS check fails SHOULD be discarded (this may not be
   possible in the case of cut through forwarding).

   Although the FCS is normally calculated just before transmission, it
   is desirable, when practical, for an FCS to accompany a frame within
   an RBridge after receipt.

5.1.  Version

   The version field specifies the TRILL VRRP protocol version of this
   packet.  This document defines version 1.

5.2.  Type

   The type field specifies the type of this TRILL VRRP packet.  The
   only packet type defined in this version of the protocol is:

   1 ADVERTISEMENT

   A packet with unknown type MUST be discarded.

5.3.  Virtual RB ID

   The Virtual RBridge Identifier (VRBID) field identifies the virtual
   RBridge this packet is reporting status for.  It is a configurable
   item in the range 1-255 (decimal).  There is no default.

5.4.   Priority

   The priority field specifies the sending TRILL VRRP RBridge's
   priority for the virtual RBridge.  Higher values equal higher
   priority.  This field is an 8-bit unsigned integer field.

   The priority value for the TRILL VRRP RBridge that owns the nicknames
   associated with the virtual nickname MUST be 255 (decimal).

   TRILL VRRP RBridges backing up a virtual RBridge MUST use priority
   values between 1-254 (decimal) and the default priority value is
   100(decimal).

   The priority value zero (0) has special meaning, indicating that the
   current Master has stopped participating in TRILL VRRP.  This is used
   to trigger backup RBridges to quickly transition to Master without
   having to wait for the current Master to time out.

5.5.   Count Nicknames

   The number of nicknames contained in this TRILL VRRP advertisement.

5.6.   Rsvd

   This field MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored on
   reception.

5.7.   Maximum Advertisement Interval (Max Adver Int)

   The Maximum Advertisement Interval is a 12-bit field that indicates
   the time interval (in centiseconds) between ADVERTISEMENTS.  The
   default is 100 centiseconds (1 second).

5.8.   Checksum

   The checksum field is used to detect data corruption in the TRILL
   VRRP message.

   The checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement
   sum of the entire TRILL VRRP message starting with the version field.
   For computing the checksum, the checksum field is set to zero.  See
   RFC1071 for more detail [CKSM].

5.9.   Virtual System ID

   The virtual system id is a 48-bit field that indicates the system id
   of the virtual RBridge this packet is reporting status for.

   All the RBridges in a virtual RBridge MUST be configured with the
   same virtual system id.  When a TRILL VRRP packet with different
   virtual system id from local virtual system id is received, the
   packet MUST be discarded.  This field is used for troubleshooting
   misconfigured RBridges.

5.10.   Nickname(s)

   One or more nicknames are associated with the virtual RBridge.  The
   number of nicknames included is specified in the "Count Nicknames"
   field.  These fields are used for troubleshooting misconfigured
   RBridges.


6.  VRRP Protocol State Machine

   The VRRP protocol state machine is not changed.  There are three
   states: Initialize, backup and master.  Initialize state is to wait
   for a startup event; backup state is to monitor the availability and
   state of the master RBridge.

   The master BRB election is according to the priority value.  When the
   RBridge is elected as a virtual RBridge master, it floods LSP with
   virtual nickname to its adjacencies.  If the RBridge is the nickname
   owner, it becomes the virtual nickname master automatically, and
   floods LSPs with owner nickname.  Backup RBridge monitors and
   receives the VRRP packet from master.  If backup RBridge has already
   enabled IS-IS protocol, it should flood LSP to withdraw its nickname
   LSA.  Otherwise the backup RBridge should not flood LSP to its
   neighbors.  The Backup RBridge exchanges hello packet with its
   neighbor, and receives LSPs from its adjacencies except from the
   master RBridge.  Moreover, it never advertises local LSA, which is
   advertised by master RBridge.

7.  IS-IS Adjacency

   Master RBridge should setup and maintain all the adjacencies with the
   other RBridges except the backup RBridge.  The Backup RBridge
   receives the other RBridges hello packets and IS-IS packets (such as
   LSP, CSNP, PSNP) besides master RBridge, but should not send any
   hello and IS-IS packets (LSP, CSNP, PSNP) to other RBridges.  The
   backup RBridge can be detect, 2-way, and report states [RFC6326].
