Internet-Draft                  PCEP MIB                   February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655] is an entity
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
   network graph, and applying computational constraints.  A Path
   Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be
   computed.

   The PCE communication protocol (PCEP) is the communication protocol
   between a PCC and PCE for point-to-point (P2P) path computations and
   is defined in [RFC5440].  Such PCEP communication interactions
   include path computation requests and path computation replies as
   well as notifications of specific states related to the use of a PCE
   in the context of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering.

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a MIB module that can be used to manage
   PCEP communications between a PCC and a PCE, or between two PCEs.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and ATD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

4.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document is built on notions introduced
   and discussed in PCE WG documents.  The reader should be familiar
   with these documents.

   Domain:  any collection of network elements within a common sphere of
      address management or path computational responsibility.

   IGP Area:  OSPF Area or ISIS level/area.

   This document also uses the terminology defined in [RFC4655] and
   [RFC5440].

5.  PCEP MIB Module Architecture

   The PCEP MIB contains the following information:

   a.  PCEP entity status.

   b.  PCEP peer information.

   c.  PCEP session information.

   d.  Notifications to indicate PCEP session changes.

5.1.  Relations to other MIB modules

   The PCEP MIB imports the following textual conventions from the INET-
   ADDRESS-MIB defined in RFC 4001 [RFC4001]:

   o  InetAddressType

   o  InetAddress

   o  InetPortNumber

   PCEP relies on existing protocols which have specialized MIB objects
   to monitor their own activities.  Consequently this document
   considers that the monitoring of underlying protocols is out of scope
   of the PCEP MIB module.

            path computation requests.  If after the expiration of the
            SYNC timer all the M path computation requests have not been
            received, a protocol error is triggered and the PCE MUST
            cancel the whole set of path computation requests.

            The aim of the SyncTimer is to avoid the storage of unused
            synchronized requests should one of them get lost for some
            reasons (for example, a misbehaving PCC)."

7.  Security Considerations

   The readable objects in the PCE-PCEP-MIB module (i.e., those with
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in
   some environments since, collectively, they provide information about
   the amount and frequency of path computation requests and responses
   within the network and can reveal some aspects of their
   configuration.

   In such environments it is important to control also GET and NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly even to encrypt their values
   when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

Internet-Draft                  PCEP MIB                   February 2013


   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:


        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------
        pcePcepMIB         { mib-2 XXX }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.
