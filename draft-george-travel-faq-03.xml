    <abstract>
      <t>This document attempts to provide a list of the common Frequently
      Asked Questions (FAQs) that IETF meeting attendees often ask regarding
      travel logistics and local information. It is intended to assist those
      who are willing to provide local information, so that if they wish to
      pre-populate answers to some or all of these questions either in the
      IETF Wiki or a meeting-specific site, they have a reasonably complete
      list of ideas to draw from. It is not meant as a list of required
      information that the host or secretariat needs to provide, merely as a
      guideline.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IETF attendees come from all over the world. The typical IETF meeting
      has representatives from in excess of 50 countries. As such, it is quite
      likely that a large portion of the participants in any given IETF are
      newcomers to the specific location where it is being held, even if an
      IETF meeting has been held in the same location in the past. It is also
      possible that this is their first trip to the country or region. As
      such, they are going to have questions regarding their own personal
      travel needs and logistics that may only be answerable by someone who
      has either been to the area before, someone who lives there, and/or
      someone who speaks the local language.</t>

      <t>While the IETF, its secretariat, and any local host organizations
      responsible for the logistics of making IETF meetings happen are not
      travel agencies, there is a set of information that most travelers wish
      to have while they are planning their trip. This document attempts to
      cover the most commonly asked questions and categories for information.
      This document is not intended to provide answers to these questions for
      every possible location in which IETF meetings may be held. Rather, it
      is intended to provide a set of FAQs for use by the hosts and others who
      have experience with the area where the event is being held, so that the
      questions and answers can be handled more efficiently than waiting until
      someone sends an email to the XXattendees@ietf.org list in the days
      leading up to the meeting.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Why is this document necessary?">
      <t>In reading this document, one may ask, "why would such a
      technologically advanced and internet-savvy organization need such help?
      Isn't that why search engines exist?" And the answer is that yes, we can
      sometimes find what we're looking for with search engines, but that
      results in hundreds of people spending their time searching, which is
      not very efficient. In addition, despite the widely held belief that if
      it is published on the Internet, it therefore must be true, sometimes
      the information that is available is either inaccurate, incomplete, or
      out of date, so it may be less reliable than firsthand info from someone
      who has been there. Also, no matter how good online translation is
      getting, some of the most informative sites may be difficult for
      non-native speakers to navigate and find information - navigation
      buttons, graphics, and other active content are typically not
      machine-translatable, and non-native speakers may not realize when
      machine translation is inaccurate in a critical way. Lastly, while the
      companies which serve as hosts for IETF meetings often have participants
      attending IETF, the folks who are responsible for handling the details
      of hosting an IETF may not be regular attendees. Therefore, this
      document is intended to be something that can be provided to host event
      organizers that may not have much familiarity with the IETF, so that
      they have a better sense of the information that attendees will find
      helpful.</t>

      <t>As stated in the introduction, the format of this document was chosen
      so that it captures the Frequently Asked Questions, but usually not
      their answers. This is because IETF RFCs are typically static and
      infrequently updated, which does not make them a particularly suitable
      format to contain location-specific information. The questions found in
      this document are a result of informal survey of multiple past meeting
      attendees mailing lists and the feedback of many individuals, and are
      believed to be reasonably static from one meeting to the next. This
      document is not necessarily all-inclusive, but should serve as a
      reasonable baseline such that a static format like an RFC is
      appropriate. It is likely that the RFC will need to be revised
      periodically - a clue that this is necessary will be when, over the
      course of multiple meetings, multiple additional questions that are not
      covered by this document surface on the attendees list and start
      becoming frequently asked questions.</t>

      <t>The answers to this document's questions are expected to be stored in
      a location which is more easily updated by multiple parties, so that
      site-specific information can be refined and updated as often as
      necessary, thereby creating a living document. There are several options
      as to where to store the location-specific living document. For some
      past IETF meetings, the hosting organization has set up a special
      website, usually containing "IETF" and the number of the meeting (e.g.
      <xref target="STOCKHOLM">ietf75.se </xref>, <xref
      target="PHILLY">ietf71.comcast.net</xref>, etc). This has been a source
      of much additional information about the location, and is always quite
      helpful. If the host decides to set up a site like this, the hope is
      that this document will provide guidance as to the sorts of information
      with which to populate such a site. However, it is by no means a
      requirement that the host set up an external website. Further, not every
      IETF meeting has a local host, or even a host at all. In these cases,
      the need for the same set of information is not lessened, but the IETF
      will be more reliant on the willingness of those with experience in the
      area where the meeting will be held to share the benefit of that
      experience with others. The IETF has provided a hosted <xref
      target="WIKI">Wiki</xref> which can simply be populated with the same
      sorts of information. This has the added benefit of having a single
      location where additional information can be provided by experienced
      travelers, locals, and host representatives alike, and is therefore not
      completely reliant on the host. In the case where the IETF-hosted Wiki
      is to be used, this document may serve as a framework of categories that
      could be pre-built when the site-specific page is set up, so that others
      can begin populating the information.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Helpful information">
      <t>There are a number of general categories of information listed below.
      Some of it is necessary for travel, the rest can be considered
      nice-to-have at best. All of it has come from actual frequently asked
      questions from the attendees mailing lists.</t>

      <t>Much of the needed information may already be available in another
      form online. There is no need to reproduce information that can be found
      on external websites, so simply providing pointers to information
      already available in other locations is quite appropriate. However, it
      is very helpful if some validation and vetting of the provided
      information is performed in order to avoid outdated or inaccurate
      information. Additionally, because this is a static and
      location-agnostic document, it's quite likely that some questions are
      either irrelevant or confusing for some locations. Therefore, "not
      really relevant here" and "we don't know" may be valid answers to some
      of these questions. In those cases, it's better to say this explicitly
      than to simply omit the section, as this will confirm that the
      information was not simply omitted. The main thing to remember when
      providing information in these categories is that those traveling to the
      event have not been there before, and so one should not assume a high
      level of background knowledge about the area, its customs, etc.</t>

              hotel bill instead of requiring local currency. It is helpful to

      <section title="Food">
        <t>The nature of IETF's schedule means that food and drink provide
        both a welcome break as well as a venue to continue discussions with
        colleagues, either related to IETF work, other shop talk, or anything
        *but* shop talk. During IETF's lunch break, approximately 1000 people
        are simultaneously looking for reasonably priced lunch options, with
        timeframes ranging from "grab and go" for a working lunch to 75
        minutes for a sit-down meal. When meetings have concluded for the day,
        the wide variety of attendees means that people are looking for all
        types of food, all price ranges, and atmosphere ranging for someplace
        suitable for an in-depth conversation to a table at the bar. The more
        information that is available about the food and drink options nearby,
        the better.</t>

        <section title="Restaurants">
          <t>It's generally helpful to note whether restaurants
          require/recommend reservations, if they have busy/rush times that
          should be avoided or planned for, etc.</t>

          <t>It's helpful for Restaurants to be categorized by:<list

              <t>proximity to venue - It's useful to highlight quick options

            <t>Soccer: If the weather cooperates, it is common for some
            IETFers to try to hold a "soccer BoF" - a pick-up soccer game
            sometime during the week of IETF. If you know of a field
            appropriate for soccer in proximity to the venue, this is useful
            information to have.</t>

      <section title="Tourism and Souveniers">
        <t>While this is certainly not necessary information for the primary
        goal of an IETF attendee, many attendees earmark a day or two on
        either side of the conference for sightseeing, and this is an
        opportunity to highlight local attractions. Links to sites containing
        information about walking tours, local tourist attractions and the
        like are certainly appreciated.</t>

        <t>Additionally, many attendees choose to purchase souvenirs as gifts
        or for personal use. In addition to the standard "tourist-trap" items
        such as t-shirts and knick-knacks, many attendees are looking for
        items that are locally crafted, local specialties, or otherwise
        significant to the local area and culture. This is another area where
        the local area can be highlighted in the information provided to
        attendees.</t>

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->

    <!-- Change Log

v00 2006-03-15  EBD   Initial version

v01 2006-04-03  EBD   Moved PI location back to position 1 -
                      v3.1 of XMLmind is better with them at this location.
v02 2007-03-07  AH    removed extraneous nested_list attribute,
                      other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                      Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                      figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                      Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                      added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative 
                      images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).  -->
