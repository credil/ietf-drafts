           Adaptive VLAN Assignment for Data Center RBridges
                  draft-zhang-trill-vlan-assign-04.txt

Abstract

   If RBridges are casually assigned as Appointed Forwarders for VLANs
   without considering the number of MAC addresses and traffic load of
   these VLANs, it may overload some of the RBridges while leave other
   RBridges lightly loaded, which reduces the scalability of a RBridge
   network and undermines its performance. 

   A new mechanism is designed in this document to support the adaptive
   VLAN assignment (or Appointed Forwarder selection) based on the
   forwarders' reporting of their usage of MAC tables and available
   bandwidth.

INTERNET-DRAFT          Adaptive VLAN Assignment       September 6, 2012


1. Introduction

   The scales of Data Center Networks (DCNs) are expanding rapidly these
   years. In DCNs, Ethernet switches and bridges are abundantly used for
   the interconnection of servers. The plug-and-play feature and the
   simple management and configuration of Ethernet are appealing to DCN
   providers. A whole DCN can be a simple large layer 2 Ethernet which
   is either built on a real network or on a virtual platform.

   Cloud Computing is growing up from DCNs which can be regarded as a
   virtual platform that provides the reuse of the network resources of
   DCNs. A lot of cloud applications have been developed by DCN
   providers, such as Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Akamai's
   Application Delivery Network (ADN) and Microsoft's Azure. Cloud
   Computing clearly brings new challenges to the traditional Ethernet.
   The scales of the DCNs are becoming too large to be carried on the
   traditional Ethernet. The valuable MAC-tables of the bridges are
   running out of use for storing millions of MAC addresses. The
   broadcast of ARP messages consumes too much bandwidth and computing
   resources. The mobility of end stations brings dynamics to the
   network which can become a heavy burden if the management and
   configuration of the network involves too much manpower. The Spanning
   Tree Protocol used in the traditional Ethernet is becoming outdated
   since there is only a single viable path on the tree for a node pair
   and this path is not always the best path (e.g., shortest path). 

   RBridges are designed to improve the shortcomings of the traditional
   Ethernet. To make use of the rich connections, RBridges introduce
   multi-pathing to the Ethernet to break the single-path constraint of
   STP. Multiple points of attachment is a basic feature supported by
   RBridges and common for Data Center Bridges. This feature not only
   increases the "east-west" capacity but also greatly enhances the
   reliability of DCNs [VL2] [SAN]. If several RBridges are attached to
   a bridged LAN link at the same time, the DRB is responsible for the
   assignment of a VLAN to one of the RBridges as the Appointed
   forwarder. However, VLAN assignment is currently done in an one-way
   manner. The DRB casually assigns a VLAN to an RBridge attached to the
   local link without knowing its available MAC-table entries or
   bandwidth. The appointed forwarder does not feedback the utilization
   of its MAC-table or bandwidth either.

   This document proposes to balance the load among VLANs. Two types of
   sub-TLVs are defined, with which a forwarder can report its MAC
   entries and traffic bit rate respectively. By gathering these report
   messages, the VLAN assignment can be done in a way that the usage of
   the MAC tables and bandwidth of the attached RBridges are balanced
   among VLANs.

INTERNET-DRAFT          Adaptive VLAN Assignment       September 6, 2012


1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Data Center RBridge

   Data Center Networks grow rapidly. Ethernet is widely used in data
   centers because of its simple management and plug-and-play features.
   However, there are shortcomings of Ethernet. RBridges are designed to
   improve these shortcomings. In this section, we analyze the
   characteristics of DCNs that impact the design of RBridges and reveal
   why the adaptive VLAN assignment is important for RBridges to be used
   in DCNs.

2.1. Scalability

   In the past years, a large DCN is typically composed of tens of
   thousands servers interconnected through switches. In the cloud
   computing era, there can be as many as millions of servers in one
   DCN. The management of the massive MAC addresses of the servers on
   the layer2 devices will become more and more complex. RBridges are
   used to replace the traditional bridges. 

   Valuable CAM-tables on RBridges can easily be used up if they are not
   used reasonably [CAMtbl]. For RBridges to be widely used in DCNs, the
   VLANs should be assigned to the RBridges in a manner that MAC entries
   of VLANs on RBridges are balanced.

2.2. East-West Capacity Increase

   The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) in the traditional LAN blocks some
   ports of bridges for the purpose of loop avoidance. The side-effects
   of STP are obvious. The link bandwidth attached to the blocked ports
   are not utilized which greatly wastes the capacity of the network. On
   the tree topology, the communication between the bridges of the left
   branch and right branch must transit the single root bridge, which
   forms a "hair-pin turn".

   With the rapid increase of the amount of servers in DCNs and their
   traffic demand, it is urgent to break the constraint of STP and
   enhance the "east-west" capacity of DCNs which are always richly
   connected. RBridges use the multi-path routing to set up the data
   plane of a TRILL campus. Multiple RBridges may be attached to a same
   LAN link, which offers multiple access points to the LAN link. The
   hosts on this LAN link is therefore multi-homed to a TRILL campus.
   All the attached RBridges can act as packet forwarders for VLANs

   carried on this LAN link. In the worst case, all the VLANs are
   assigned to a single RBridge. Under this scenario, the ingress
   capacity on other RBridges is wasted. It is necessary to balance the
   traffic load of VLANs among these RBridges through the assignment of
   VLANs.

2.3. Virtualization

   Virtualization is important for increasing the utilization of network
   resources in DCNs. For example, the VPNs can be used to separate the
   traffic from different services therefore they can be carried on the
   same pool of resources. When the VPNs is carried over a TRILL campus,
   RBridges can use a VLAN tag to identify each VPN. However, the use of
   VLANs multiplies the entries in the MAC table of RBridges. 

   Virtual Machines (VM) are widely used in DCNs. A physical host can
   support tens of VMs and each VM has to be identified by one MAC
   address that is need to be stored in MAC tables of RBridges. This
   seriously increases the number of MAC entries in RBridges. Moreover,
   the number of VMs in a VLAN is not necessarily equal to the number of
   physical hosts. VMs are spawned or destroyed based on the demand of
   applications. They can also migrate from one location to another,
   which may be either an in-service or out-of-service move. VMs bring
   about the volatility of the size of VLANs. It is hard to provide one
   static VLAN assignment for a TRILL campus based on the numbers of
   physical hosts of VLANs that is proper for all applications all the
   time.

3. MAC Entries Usage 

   A CAM-table on a switch is expensive, which is a major constraint on
   the scalability of Ethernet [CAMtable]. When an RBridge is used to
   connect lots of hosts in large Data Center Networks, the entries of
   the CAM-table can easily be used up. The network should be tactically
   interconnected and valuable MAC table entries should be used
   economically.

   RBridges support multiple points of attachment [RFC6325]. When
   RBridges are used in a DCN to form a TRILL campus, a LAN link MAY
   have multiple access points to this campus. All these access RBridges
   are able to act as the packet forwarder of VLANs carried on this LAN
   link. The DRB of this LAN link is responsible to pick out one RBridge
   attached to this LAN link as the appointed forwarder for each VLAN-x.
   In other words, the DRB assigns VLAN-x to one of the RBridge. For an
   assigned VLAN, its forwarder is not only responsible for forwarding
   the packets for this VLAN but also need to store active MAC addresses
   of hosts on this VLAN.

INTERNET-DRAFT          Adaptive VLAN Assignment       September 6, 2012


   If VLANs on a LAN link are not appointed properly, some RBridges's
   MAC tables are easily to be used up while other RBridges are left
   idle. Take Figure 3.1 as an example, there are four VLANs carried on
   the LAN link: w, x, y and z. There are two hosts in both VLAN-w and
   VLAN-x and one host in both VLAN-y and VLAN-z. RB1 and RB2 are both
   attached to this LAN link. RB1 is elected as the Designated RBridge
   who is responsible to choose appointed forwarders for the above
   VLANs. In the figure, VLAN-w,x are assigned to RB1 and VLAN-y,z are
   assigned to RB2. Obviously, this assignment is not balanced, since
   the MAC table of RB1 has four entries while the MAC table of RB2 only
   has two entries. If the DRB can reassign VLAN-w to RB2 and reassign
   VLAN-y to RB1, both RBridges will have three MAC entries, therefore a
   more balanced assignment is achieved.

             Figure 3.1: Unbalanced assignment among VLANs

   In order to assign the VLANs in a balanced way, the DRB need to know
   the usage of MAC tables of its appointed forwarders. Since RBridges
   only store active MAC addresses and a virtual machine can move from
   one location to another, MAC entries that a VLAN occupies on an
   RBridge varies from time to time. The assignment of VLANs cannot be
   done once for all. It is necessary for the DRB to do the assignment

INTERNET-DRAFT          Adaptive VLAN Assignment       September 6, 2012


   adaptively taking the usage of MAC tables of its appointed forwarders
   into consideration. 

   In Section 5.1, the MAC Entries Report sub-TLV is defined to deliver
   this kind of information from a forwarder to a DRB.

4. Load Distribution

   The traffic from the TRILL campus to the local LAN link is the
   egressing traffic while the traffic from the local LAN link to the
   TRILL campus is the ingressing traffic. A forwarder RBridge acts as
   both the ingress and egress point of a VLAN's traffic. The assignment
   of the appointed forwarder for each VLAN affects both the egress and
   ingress traffic load distribution.

4.1. Egress Traffic

   One RBridge MAY have multiple ports attached to the same local LAN
   link. These ports are called "port group" [RFC6325]. When a DRB
   assigns a VLAN to an RBridge, its total available egress bandwidth of
   the port group needs to be taken into consideration. 

   After VLAN-x has been assigned to an RBridge, the forwarding port
   assignment of one of the port group to VLAN-x as the forwarding port
   is entirely a local matter. Since a LAN link is a STP domain, more
   than one forwarding port for one VLAN will cause a loop. The
   forwarder MUST assign one and only one port for each VLAN. Load
   balancing among multiple ports on the same link can be realized
   through splitting the load among different VLANs as suggested in
   Section 4.4.4 of [RFC6325]. 

4.2. Ingress Traffic

   After packets enter a TRILL campus from the ingress RBridge, they are
   sent through the paths starting at this ingress point. Since the DRB
   knows the whole topology of the TRILL campus, it can figure out these
   paths as well. Therefore, the DRB should take the available bandwidth
   of these paths into consideration when assigning the appointed
   forwarder of a VLAN. Any assignment that is possible to congest an
   already busy ingress point or a path should be avoided. 

   Traffic Matrices are usually taken as the input to the traffic
   engineering methods [TE]. VLAN assignment actually changes the
   Traffic Matrix of a TRILL campus. Therefore, our adaptive VLAN
   assignment can work together with traffic engineering methods to
   achieve a balanced traffic distribution of the whole network.
   However, the design of this kind of cooperative mechanism is out the
   scope of this document.

INTERNET-DRAFT          Adaptive VLAN Assignment       September 6, 2012


   With the TLV defined in Section 5.2, the egressing and ingressing
   traffic of an appointed forwarder are reported to its DRB. 

5. Feedback Sub-TLVs

   The Appointed Forwarders TLV has already been defined in [RFC6326].
   With this TLV, the DRB can appoint an RBridge on the local link to be
   the forwarder for each VLAN. However, there is no feedback from the
   appointed forwarder to notify the DRB whether the assignment is
   reasonable. Two sub-TLVs are defined in this section to open the
   passageway of feedback. 

5.1. MAC Entries Report Sub-TLV 

   Appointed forwarders use MAC Entries Report sub-TLV to report the
   usage of their MAC tables to the DRB. It has the following format:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Type=MACEtrRep |                               (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Length       |                               (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  DRB Nickname                 |               (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Maximum MAC Entries          |               (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Available MAC Entries        |               (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |          MAC Entries of VLAN Range (1)      | (6 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |          ......                             | (6 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |          MAC Entries of VLAN Range (n)      | (6 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where each "MAC Entries of VLAN Range" is of the form:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | RESV  |     Start.VLAN        |               (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | RESV  |     End.VLAN          |               (2 bytes)

      appointed forwarder selects to report.

   o  DRB Nickname: The nickname of the Designated RBridge of the local
      link.

   o  Maximum MAC Entries: The maximum number of the entries of the MAC
      table of the appointed forwarder.

   o  Available MAC Entries: The number of available entries of the
      appointed forwarder's MAC table.

   o  RESV: These bits MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

   o  Start.VLAN, End.VLAN: These fields are the VLAN IDs of the
      appointment range, inclusive. To specify a single VLAN, the VLAN's
      ID appears as both the start and end VLAN [RBissib].

   o  The Number of MAC Entries: The number of MAC entries occupied by
      the given VLAN range. These MAC entries does not only contain the
      MAC addresses of hosts on the local link but also includes the MAC
      addresses on the remote link in the same VLAN range.

5.2. Traffic Bit Rate Report Sub-TLV 

   Appointed forwarders use Traffic Bit Rate Report sub-TLV to report
   the bandwidth utilization of their ports (or port groups) to the DRB.
   This sub-TLV has the following format:

      appointed forwarder selects to report.

   o  DRB Nickname: The nickname of the Designated RBridge of the local
      link.

      group) attached to the local link.

   o  Available Link Bandwidth: The available bandwidth of the port (or
      port group) attached to the local link.

   o  RESV: These bits MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

   o  D: The direction of the traffic. Value "0" denotes the egressing
      traffic volume and value "1" denotes the ingressing traffic
      volume.

   o  Start.VLAN, End.VLAN: These fields are the VLAN IDs of the
      appointment range, inclusive. To specify a single VLAN, the VLAN's
      ID appears as both the start and end VLAN [RBissib].

   o  Traffic Bit Rate: The traffic bit rate of the given VLAN range
      from/to the local link through the attaching ports group of the
      appointed forwarder.

6. Adaptive VLAN Assignment

   Appointed forwarders MAY advertise the MAC Entries Report Sub-TLV and
   Traffic Bit Rate Report Sub-TLV included in Multi-Topology-Aware Port
   Capability TLV in LSPs to their DRBs. The number of VLANs in these
   TLVs is constrained by the maximum size of HELLO messages which is
   1470 octets [RFC6325]. If it is not big enough to hold the
   information for all VLANs, appointed forwarders choose VLANs in the
   order of most MAC entries first and highest load first to report to
   the DRB. An appointed forwarder SHOULD report these two sub-TLVs to
   its DRB each time the DRB assigns a VLAN to it. Its adjacency to the
   DRB MUST be in Report state [RFC6327]. In order to relieve the burden

INTERNET-DRAFT          Adaptive VLAN Assignment       September 6, 2012


   of feedback, thresholds MAY be imposed on the report of these sub-
   TLVs. For example, when the usage of MAC table increases by 10
   percent, the Appointed Forwarder reports the MAC Entries Report Sub-
   TLV to its DRB.

   The usage of the MAC table and the utilization of bandwidth of this
   appointed forwarder is calculated on the DRB. The DRB SHOULD choose
   an appointed forwarder for the local link based on Least
   Usage/Utilization First (LUF) policy. If an RBridge on the local link
   is already overloaded, the DRB should refrain from assigning
   additional VLANs to it.

   An Appointed Forwarder may fail or get overloaded [RBclear]. The
   usage of MAC tables and bandwidth of Appointed Forwarders attached to
   a LAN link changes with time elapses and a balanced VLAN assignment
   may become unbalanced. For example, the bandwidth of an Appointed
   Forwarder may run out of use due to the increase of traffic demand.
   The usage of the MAC table of an Appointed Forwarder may change
   greatly due to host mobility. In such situations, the DRB need to
   modify the appointment of VLANs on a LAN link. The change of
   Appointed Forwarder of a VLAN brings service interruption to this
   VLAN, therefore the reassignment of VLANs from existing Appointed
   Forwarder to a new Appointed Forwarder should be limited.

   It has been a common practice to collect MAC table usage in bridge
   networks. Through the collection of the above two sub-TLVs (e.g.,
   stored in MIB [RBmib].), operators will have a vision of the MAC
   table usage and bandwidth utilization of the RBridges on the LAN
   link. Based on this vision, operators can easily recognize the hot
   spot of the TRILL campus, which facilitates the trouble shooting. 

7. Partial VLANs Appointment

   [RFC6349] indicates that the appointed VLAN list for one appointed
   forwarder sent in an Appointed Forwarders Sub-TLV should be
   contiguous. In particular, when the designated VLAN falls in the
   range of the appointed VLANs list, the DRB should have two
   appointments with contiguous appointed VLAN ranges for one appointed
   forwarder. However, on a LAN link, a DRB can flexibly appoint any
   VLAN to any appointed forwarder. This flexibility creates the
   necessity to allow DRB to have discrete appointments to one appointed
   forwarder. The following example shows this necessity and reveals the
   issue caused by discrete VLAN appointment.

   When enabled VLANs of two RBriges attached to the same link have
   intersections, DRB SHOULD guarantee that the sets of VLANs appointed
   to these two RBridges do not overlap. With the adaptive VLAN
   assignment method defined in this document, the DRB is probably to

INTERNET-DRAFT          Adaptive VLAN Assignment       September 6, 2012


   discretely assign VLANs of this intersection to achieve load balance
   among these two RBridges. Suppose both RB1 and RB2 have enabled the
   VLANs from 2 through 4094 on the local link. VLAN 1 is the Designated
   VLAN for this link. Suppose RB1 gets all the odd numbered VLANs while
   RB2 gets all the even numbered VLANs. The DRB has to use 2046
   appointments for RB1 and 2047 appointments for RB2. Since one
   appointment consumes 6 octets [RBisisb] and a TRILL-HELLO message
   MUST NOT exceed 1470 octets [RFC6325]. Even these octets are all used
   for VLAN appointments, a TRILL-HELLO at most contains 245
   appointments. The 4093 appointments obviously exceeds the maximum
   number of appointments that one TRILL-HELLO can have.

   The following two sub-TLVs are defined to enable the DRB to send out
   a appointed VLANs list to its appointed forwarders in multiple TRILL-
   HELLOs, which is similar as the TRILL Neighbor TLV [RBisisb].

7.1 Partial Appointed Forwarder Sub-TLV

   This section defines a sub-TLV adapted from the Appointed Forwarders
   sub-TLV [RBisisb]. This sub-TLV can appear in MT-PORT-CAP TLVs of
   multiple TRILL-HELLOs.

   o  Type: sub-TLV type, set to MT-PORT-CAP ParAppFwdr Sub-TLV TBD.

   o  Length: 1+6n bytes, where there are n appointments.

   o  Appointee Nickname: The nickname of the IS being appointed a
      forwarder.

   o  S: Start flag. If this bit is a one, then the first Appointment
      Information of this sub-TLV is the first appointment of the
      appointed VLANs list sent by the DRB.

   o  E: End flag. If this bit is a one, then the last Appointment
      Information of this sub-TLV is the last appointment of the
      appointed VLANs list sent by the DRB.

   o  R, RESV: These bits are reserved and MUST be sent as zero and
      ignored on receipt.

   o  Start.VLAN, End.VLAN: These fields are the VLAN IDs of the
      appointment range, inclusive. To specify a single VLAN, the VLAN's
      ID appears as both the start and end VLAN. As specified in
      [RFC6439], appointing an IS forwarder on a port for a VLAN not
      enabled on that port has no effect.

   This sub-TLV enables the DRB to send VLAN appointment information in
   multiple TRILL-HELLOs without the constraint of the size of a single
   TRILL-HELLO. An IS's nickname can occur as an appointed forwarder for
   multiple VLAN ranges by occurrences of this sub-TLV within the MT
   Port Capability TLV [RBisisb]. However, an IS's nickname SHOULD only
   occur as an appointed forwarder within the same TRILL-HELLO.

7.2 Partial VLANs Appointing Sub-TLV

   This section defines another sub-TLV adapted from the VLANs Appointed
   sub-TLV [RBisisb], which allows DRB to assign lots of VLANs to one
   appointed forwarder in a bitmap format. This sub-TLV can appear in
   MT-PORT-CAP sub-TLVs of multiple TRILL-HELLOs as well.

      forwarder.

      appointment of the appointed VLANs list sent by the DRB.

   o  E: End flag. If this bit is a one, then this is the last
      appointment of the appointed VLANs list sent by the DRB.

   o  R, RESV: These bits are reserved and MUST be sent as zero and
      ignored on receipt.

   o  Start VLAN ID: The 12-bit VLAN ID that is represented by the high
      order bit of the first byte of the VLAN bit-map.

   o  VLAN bit-map: The highest order bit indicates the VLAN equal to
      the start VLAN ID, the next highest bit indicates the VLAN equal
      to start VLAN ID + 1, continuing to the end of the VLAN bit-map
      field.

   In [RBisisb], an appointed forwarder sends the VLANs Appointed Sub-
   TLV  to its neighbors including the DRB. In this document, the
   Partial VLANs Appointing sub-TLV is used by the DRB to assign
   multiple discrete VLANs to an appointed forwarder.

   A DRB can alternatively pick one of the above two sub-TLVs to send
   appointment information to a specific appointed forwarder. However,
   it is recommended that the DRB choose the option consuming less
   octets in the TRILL-HELLO. In the above example, if the DRB sends out
   the appointment using the Partial Appointed Forwarder Sub-TLV, RB1

   has 2047 appointments which consumes 2047*6 = 12276 octets. Instead,
   if the DRB uses the Partial VLANs Appointing Sub-TLV, it only
   consumes 512 octets.

   An appointed forwarder begins to accumulate VLAN appointments when it
   receives either of the above two sub-TLVs whose first Appointment
   Information sets the Start flag to a one. This appointed forwarder
   will wait its Holding Time for either a Partial Appointed Forwarders
   Sub-TLV or a Partial VLANs Appointing Sub-TLV whose End flag is set
   to a one. If that sub-TLV is received before the Holding Timer
   expires, the appointed forwarder will issue the accumulated VLAN
   appointments. If the sub-TLV whose End flag is a one is not received
   before the Holding Timer expires, all these accumulated VLAN
   appointments will be discarded.

8. Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues for IS-IS.

9. IANA Considerations

   This document suggests to specify four new Sub-TLVs from existing
   sub-TLV sequences -- namely MACEtrRep, TrafficRep, ParAppFwdr and
   ParVLANApp.
