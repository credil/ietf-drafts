Abstract

   This document explorers the design of an HTTP-based DECADE Resource
   Protocol (DRP), which can be used for content and resource management
   between a DECADE Client and a DECADE Server, or between two DECADE
   Servers.  We identify the function entities, and present initial
   protocol message flow and syntax design.  The purpose of this
   document is to get design discussion started, not to provide a
   complete solution.

Internet-Draft                     DRP                          Mar 2011


1.  Introduction

   The DECADE Architecture document [I-D.ietf-decade-arch-03] identifies
   a DECADE architecture that consists of two logically independent
   protocols: the DECADE Resource Protocol (DRP) and the Standard Data
   Transport (SDT).  The formal provides access control and resource
   scheduling between two DECADE peers, while the latter is used to
   transfer data objects to and from a DECADE Server.  The architecture
   document observes that the two protocols may be realized on the same
   wire.

   In this document, we present an initial design of a DRP based on
   HTTP.  We use the DECADE requirements [I-D.ietf-decade-reqs-04] to
   guide our design.  The purpose of this document is to get design
   discussions started, not to provide a complete solution.

   Specifically, the DRP we present provides a signaling layer for
   transport negotiation, content management, access control and
   resource control.  The SDT is responsible for data put, retrieve,
   delete, and metadata update, and the implementation of access control
   and resource control policies.

   We also show that the HTTP based DRP may be extended to include an
   HTTP based SDT, achieving a same-wire design, although it is also
   possible to use another SDT.


2.  Terminologies and concepts

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", "MAY NOT" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This draft uses the terms defined in [I-D.ietf-decade-reqs-04] and in
   [I-D.ietf-decade-arch-03].

   DECADE peers: Entities involved in the DRP, such as a DECADE Server
   or a DECADE Client.


3.  Protocol Overview

3.1.  Overview

   DECADE Protocol is spoken between DECADE Client and DECADE Server or
   between DECADE Servers to manage, store, and retrieve data objects
   for data distribution.  A DECADE Client can be an application server,
   or embedded in a web browser, etc.

   DECADE needs a mandatory naming scheme, that can be used to achieve
   content security and de-duplication.  In this initial design, we
   assume that the name space is flat for simplicity.  We anticipate
   that the name scheme should also allow for group operations on a set
   of data objects with a similar/same attribute.

3.2.  Function Entities

   We consider two primary function entities involved in DECADE: the
   DECADE Server and the DECADE Client.

   DECADE Server: A DECADE Server stores DECADE data inside the network,
   and thereafter manages both the stored data and access to that data
   [I-D.ietf-decade-arch-02].

   DECADE Client: A DECADE Client stores and retrieves data at DECADE
   Servers [I-D.ietf-decade-arch-02].

   (To be added...)

3.5.  Protocol Operations

   The DRP we present is a request-response protocol.  Requests and
   corresponding responses are exchanged between DECADE Client and
   Server or between DECADE Servers.

   In particular, we identify the following operations:

      Access Token: This operation allows the DECADE Server to limit
      access and resource control of data objects stored on it via
      authenticated tokens.  The token should limit permitted operations
      to permitted objects by permitted clients during permitted period,
      as well as priority for bandwidth given to requested operation,
      and so on.

      Query Server Statue (from the system's view): This operation
      allows a DECADE Client to query statue information of a specific
      DECADE Server from the server view, e.g., lists of associated
      objects, resource used/available, and so on.

      Query Server Statue (from the user's view): This operation allows
      a DECADE Client to query its related statue information of a
      specific DECADE Server, e.g., list of associated objects the
      DECADE Client stored in the Server, the Client's available
      resources, and so on.

      Query Object Property: This operation allows a DECADE Client to
      query object properties with certain authentication, including TTL
      of object, object size, or object type.

      Set Object Property: This operation allows a DECADE Client to set
      data object properties with certain authentication.

      Delete Data Object: This operation is used to delete data objects
      from a DECADE Server.

   Complementing the preceding DRP operations, the following SDT
   operations may be defined for a complete DECADE Protocol:

      Put Data Object: This operation is used to write data objects to a
      DECADE Server.

      Get Data Object: This operation is used to download data objects
      from a DECADE Server.


4.  Access and Resource Control

   The authors think extending existing IETF protocol for resource
   control in DECADE is reasonable, for example, adding bandwidth
   allocation, weight or priority parameters to exisitng protocol for
   granting third party to access the data objects owned by the resource
   owner.  The authors made evaluation on the applicability of existing
   OAuth, AAA, and Kerberos protocols for the resource control of DECADE
   system.

   Kerberos [RFC4120] is useful in insecure domain to establish a secure
   channel between a client and server.  The Kerberos server assigns a
   shared session key, which will be responded from Kerberos
   authentication server(or ticket granting server) to the client (there
   are two copies of the session key.  One copy is embedded in the
   Ticket together with the client's ID, and is encrypted with the
   server's key, and another copy is encrypted in the client's key.)
   The client and server will use that session key to secure their
   communication.

   So the conclusion is Kerberos is to build a secure channel between a
   client and server in a single domain, while inter-domain will get
   difficult.  It does not look like a good candidate to assign network
   resources from the in-network storage server for content distribution
   to DECADE compatible application clients.

   Radius [RFC 2865] [RFC 2866] and its successor Diameter [RFC 3588]
   are the base AAA protocols.  Although extending the binary attribute-
   value-pairs (AVPs) can be used to grant network resources for data
   access, but the resource control communication points in the DECADE
   envioroment are application clients/servers and DECADE servers, so a
   text-based protocol is preferred for the application clients.  But it
   does not prevent that the Diameter protocol can be used between
   DECADE server and application server for AAA purpose.

   OAuth v2 [draft-ietf-oauth-protocol-v2-23] is used to grant access to
   the resource owner's resources from a third party without explictly
   explosure the resource owner's credentials.  Now it is only designed
   for HTTP[RFC2616].  The three-leg-style access assumption is
   different from the access requirement in the DECADE system
   enviroment, which made the resouce owner credential authorization
   mode and some other part of the protocol specification does not
   comply DECADE system requirements.  But some grant types can be used
   (such like implicit grant type) and extensions are needed for resouce
   control.  However, where the token code implicitly correlative to the
   resource would require the authorization server to maintain states,
   an explicit way to describe the resource consumer's rights will be
   preferred in this spec.


5.  Token Structure/HTTP Authentication Format

   A primary use case for DECADE is a DECADE Client authorizing other
   DECADE Clients to store or retrieve data objects from its DECADE
   storage.  Therefore, DECADE protocol adopts a token-based
   authentication scheme instead of explicitly manipulating an Access
   Control List (ACL) for each DECADE data object.

Internet-Draft                     DRP                          Mar 2011


   Token can be generated by the DECADE Client itself or any of its
   trusted parties/entities.  After the token has been generated, it can
   be distributed to other DECADE Clients which then can be used to
   request for access to the DECADE Server.  In this way, token can
   support anonymous access, and a DECADE Server does not need to know
   the identity of each DECADE Client that accesses it.

   In order to provide a complete authentication scheme, the token MUST
   carries the following information: Permitted operations, Permitted
   objects, Permitted Clients, Expiration time, Priority for bandwidth
   given to requested operation, Amount of data that may be read or
   written.

   The token can be carried with the request message using HTTP header.
   The header has the following format:

   X-DECADE-TOKEN: DECADE signature

   The "signature" represents alphanumeric or numeric data to be
   inserted, which includes necessary authentication information
   described before.  Those information are calculated based on HMAC-
   SHA1, one of the most widely used encryption method.  It is one of
   the most widely-adopted cryptographic hash functions and can provide
   a secure transport mode that allows for encryption.

   Signature = Base64(HMAC-SHA1(UTF-8-Encoding-Of(StringToSign)))

   StringToSign = PermittedOperation1 + "\n" + ... + PermittedOperationm
   + "\n" + PermittedObject1 + "\n" + ... + PermittedObjectn + "\n" +
   TTL + "\n" + Priority for bandwidth given to requested operation +
   "\n" + Amount of data that may be read or written + "\n"

   After the DECADE Server receives the token, it will retrieve
   information from the token and verify its validity.  If the token is
   valid, the request/certain operations will be authenticated,
   otherwise, it will be rejected.  If the token is successfully
   validated, the DECADE Server applies the resources control policies
   indicated in the token while performing the operation.


6.  Message Syntax and Processing

   We now present the encoding and processing.

6.1.  Encoding

   The DRP in this document follows the standard request and response
   formats for HTTP Request and Response messages [RFC2616].



Wang & Yang            Expires September 13, 2011               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                     DRP                          Mar 2011


   Specifically, the header fields in both request and response messages
   follows the standard rules for HTTP/1.1 Header fields, which MAY be
   included in the messages if necessary.

   We use JSON to encode the bodies for both request and response
   messages.

   In the following messages, both *** and XXX represent data to be
   insert, either numeric data or alphanumeric data.

6.2.  Common Message Processing

   After receiving a DECADE protocol message, some basic processing will
   be performed, regardless of the message type and the receiving
   entity.

   Upon receiving a message, the message is examined to ensure that it
   is properly formed, which is done by the receiver itself.  If not,
   appropriate standard HTTP errors MUST be generated.

   If the message is found to be incorrectly formed or the length does
   not match the length encoded in the header, the receiver MUST reply
   with an HTTP 400 response.

   If the version number is not supported by the receiver, the receiver
   MUST reply with an HTTP 400 response.

   If the receiver is unable to process the message temporarily because
   it is in an overloaded state, the receiver SHOULD reply with an HTTP
   503 response.

   If the receiver encounters an internal error while attempting to
   process the message, the receiver MUST generate an HTTP 500 response.

6.3.  DECADE Messages

   DECADE protocol can be divided into two layers, the signaling layer
   and the transport layer.  The signaling layer is responsible for the
   transport negotiation, data management, access control and resource
   control.  Transport layer is responsible for data put, retrieve,
   delete, and metadata update, and the implementation of access control
   and resource control policies.  Therefore, SDT messages must be
   extended to include tokens.

6.3.1.  Transport_Query Message

   After the DECADE Client locating its authenticated DECADE Server,
   transport capability query MUST be performed between them.  A

Internet-Draft                     DRP                          Mar 2011


   Transport_Query message is used to query the DECADE server about
   supported transports.  A DECADE client will send a request to the
   DECADE server to ask for the transport protocols supported by the
   server.  And then the DECADE server will send back a reply with the
   supported transport protocols.  DECADE server must listen on the
   server ports of the supported protocols (e.g.  NFS).  By that, the
   DECADE client (active) can impose data operations on the DECADE
   server using either one of the supported transport protocols
   supported by the DECADE server.  Below is an example Transport_Query
   message:
   GET /decade/transport/ HTTP/1.1
   Host:  example.com
   Content-Length: ***
   Content-Type: application/decade-transport-req+json
   X-DECADE-Protocol-Version: 1.0

   If the query message is valid, the DECADE Server sends back a
   response listing the supported SDT protocols.  An example is shown
   below:
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Length: ***
   Content-Type: application/decade-transport-ans+json
   X-DECADE-Protocol-Version: 1.0

   {
   "transport-protocol":
           {
                   "HTTP": true;
                   "NFS": true;
                   "WebDAV": true;
           }
   }

   JSON Object:
   Object {
           JSONBool HTTP;     [OPTIONAL]
           JSONBool NFS;      [OPTIONAL]
           JSONBool WebDav;   [OPTIONAL]
   } TransportProtocol;

   Object {
       TransportProtocol transport-protocol;
   }

   When the DECADE Client receive the response from the Server, it will
   choose a certain protocol it can support and then communicate with
   the Server via the chosen protocol.

6.3.2.  Access_Token Message

   In addition to distributing token to authenticated DECADE Clients,
   DECADE Server should also allow single DECADE Client to access token
   from it via the ACCESS_TOKEN message.  This message allows a DECADE
   Client to obtain an access token from a DECADE Server to limit access
   and achieve resource control.  An example message is as following:
   POST /decade/token HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Content-Length: ***
   Content-Type: application/decade-access-token-req+json
   X-DECADE-Protocol-Version: 1.0

   {
       JSONString: DECADEClientId;
   }

   If the DECADE Client identifier is valid and the request message is
   successfully proceeded, the DECADE Server will reply with the
   authenticate token.  An example of the response message is as below:
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/decade-access-token-ans+json
   X-DECADE-Protocol-Version: 1.0

   {
       JSONString: token;
   }

6.3.3.  Server_States_Query Message

   This operation allows state query.  The state can be either system-
