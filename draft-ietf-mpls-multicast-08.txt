This document offers a framework for IP multicast deployment in an
MPLS environment.  Issues arising when MPLS techniques are applied to
IP multicast are overviewed.  The pros and cons of existing IP
multicast routing protocols in the context of MPLS are described and
the relation to the different trigger methods and label distribution
modes are discussed.  The consequences of various layer 2 (L2)
technologies are listed.  Both point-to-point and multi-access
networks are considered.

This document is a product of the Multiprotocol Label Switching
Working Group of the IETF.
