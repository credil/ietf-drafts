                         Using CoAP with IPsec
                  draft-bormann-core-ipsec-for-coap-00

Abstract

   CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and
   networks.  Security for the protocol can be supplied in a number of
   ways.  The mandatory-to-implement security mode for CoAP makes use of
   DTLS.  Other applications may want to use IPsec.

   This document will discuss considerations for the use of IPsec with
   CoAP.  It will be advanced on a timescale separate from the main CoAP
   specification, as most experience in securing CoAP so far has been
   made with DTLS.

   The current version of this specification is a placeholder, built out
   of text extracted from draft-ietf-core-coap-12.  It is meant to pick
   up http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/core/trac/ticket/262 and provide a
   home for its considerations.  It might be merged with other documents
   later.

1.  Introduction

   (see abstract for now)

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, BCP 14
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant CoAP
   implementations.

   In this document, the term "byte" is used in its now customary sense
   as a synonym for "octet".

   Where bit arithmetic is explained, this document uses the notation
   familiar from the programming language C, except that the operator
   "**" stands for exponentiation.

2.  Using CoAP with IPsec

   One mechanism to secure CoAP [I-D.ietf-core-coap] in constrained
   environments is the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
   [RFC4303] when CoAP is used without DTLS in NoSec Mode.  Using IPsec
   ESP with the appropriate configuration, it is possible for many
   constrained devices to support encryption with built-in link-layer
   encryption hardware.  For example, some IEEE 802.15.4 radio chips are
   compatible with AES-CBC (with 128-bit keys) [RFC3602] as defined for
   use with IPsec in [RFC4835].  Alternatively, particularly on more
   common IEEE 802.15.4 hardware that supports AES encryption but not
   decryption, and to avoid the need for padding, nodes could directly
   use the more widely supported AES-CCM as defined for use with IPsec
   in [RFC4309], if the security considerations in Section 9 of that
   specification can be fulfilled.

   Necessarily for AES-CCM, but much preferably also for AES-CBC, static
   keying should be avoided and the initial keying material be derived
   into transient session keys, e.g. using a low-overhead mode of IKEv2
   [RFC5996] as described in [I-D.kivinen-ipsecme-ikev2-minimal]; such a
   protocol for managing keys and sequence numbers is also the only way
   to achieve anti-replay capabilities.  However, no recommendation can
   be made at this point on how to manage group keys (i.e., for
   multicast) in a constrained environment.  Once any initial setup is
   completed, IPsec ESP adds a limited overhead of approximately 10
   bytes per packet, not including initialization vectors, integrity
   check values and padding required by the cipher suite.

   When using IPsec to secure CoAP, both authentication and
   confidentiality SHOULD be applied as recommended in [RFC4303].  The
   use of IPsec between CoAP endpoints is transparent to the application
   layer and does not require special consideration for a CoAP
   implementation.

   IPsec may not be appropriate for all environments.  For example,
   IPsec support is not available for many embedded IP stacks and even
   in full PC operating systems or on back-end web servers, application
   developers may not have sufficient access to configure or enable
   IPsec or to add a security gateway to the infrastructure.  Problems
   with firewalls and NATs may furthermore limit the use of IPsec.
