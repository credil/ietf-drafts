Abstract

   This document specifies Stateless Automatic IPv4 over IPv6 Tunneling
   with IPv4 Address Sharing (SA46T-AS) base specification.  SA46T-AS is

1.  Introduction

   This document provides Stateless Automatic IPv4 over IPv6 Tunneling
   with IPv4 Address Sharing (SA46T-AS) base specification.

   SA46T-AS is basically the same technology with SA46T
   [I-D.draft-matsuhira-sa46t-spec] , however that have IPv4 address
   sharing capability.

   The basic architecture of the SA46T-AS is the same with SA46T, so
   SA46T-AS can provide all of SA46T function, such as making bachbone
   network IPv6 only , or provide many IPv4 network planes over single
   IPv6 backbone network.

   SA46T-AS add IPv4 address sharing function to SA46T. So, SA46T-AS
   enable many host to share single IPv4 global address.

   SA46T is gateway technology, not protocol.


2.  Architecture of SA46T-AS

   Figure 1 shows SA46T address architecture.  SA46T map IPv4 address to
   SA46T address keeping locator - identifier relation.  The n bits
   identifier part of IPv4 address and n bits identifier part of IPv6
   address is the same value, and the 32-n bits locator part in IPv4
   address and 128 - n bits locator part in IPv6 address is the same
   meaning.  So, the meaning of routing information is the same between
   IPv4 space and IPv6 space.

                                 Figure 1

   Figure 2 shows SA46T-AS address architecture.  SA46T-AS address
   consists four parts, SA46T-AS prefix, IPv4 network plane ID, IPv4
   address, and Port number.  That mean SA46T-AS address consists SA46T
   address and port number.

   |                                                            (n bits)


                                 Figure 2

   In SA46T, boundary of locator and identifier is in IPv4 address part,
   however in SA46T-AS, boundary of locator and identifier is in port
   number part, that mean, SA46T-AS use upper part of port number as
   locator, and lower part of port number as identifier.

3.  SA46T-AS address format

   Figure 3 show a example of SA46T-AS address format.  In this example,
   16bits IPv4 network plane ID is used, that provide 65535 IPv4 network
   plane.

4.1.  Client environments

   Figure 4 shows a example of SA46T-AS usage in client environments.
   In this document, NAPT is IPv4 - IPv4 Netowrk address and port number
   translator.  Coopetation with NAPT, SA46T-AS provide IPv4 address
   sharing with different users.

   Figure 5 shows an example of SA46T-AS usage in server environments.
   In this example, server terminate SA46T-AS tunnel.  This case, Server
   require at least one port number per server, that mean, 128bits host
   route advertise for server access via IPv4.  This case, full access
   is provided via IPv6.

   Figure 6 shows an example of SA46T-AS usage in Data Center
   environments.  In this example, SA46T-AS is used only in Data Center
   Backend Network closely.  Client which is connected via backbone
   network does not know the exists of SA46T-AS.  SA46T-AS can provide
   at least one port number per server, this case, 128bits host route is
   advertised, however this route in advertised only in data center
   backbone network.  Ofcource, IPv6 address may allocated to the
   server, so full access is provided via IPv6.

5.  Port Number Issue

   SA46T-AS require port number of transport layer.  SA46T-AS can not
   support ICMPv4 [RFC0792].  The function provided by ICMPv4 does not
   work in SA46T-AS environments, such as Path MTU Discovery [RFC1191],
   ping command, etc.

   SA46T-AS can not also support IPv4 ESP[RFC4303] because transport
   header is encrypted.


6.  Characteristic

   SA46T has following useful characteristics.

   o  Reduce backbone network operation cost with IPv6 single stack ( at
      least less than Dual Stack)

Internet-Draft                  SA46T-AS                      April 2012


   o  Can allocate IPv4 address to stub networks, which used in backbone
      network before installing SA46T

   o  Less configuration

   o  No need for special protocol

   o  No dependent Layer 2 network

   o  Can Stack IPv4 Private networks

   o  Easy stop IPv4 operation in stub network for future ( just remove
      SA46T)

   o  Provide redundancy

   Moreover, SA46T-AS add following characteristsics to SA46T.
