Abstract

   The session initiation protocol(SIP) which designed by IETF is also
   being considered as the core protocol for multimedia communication.
   This document describes a source address validation Improvement(SAVI)
   solution for SIP protocol or other security mechanisms. The SAVI was
   developed to prevent IP source address spoofing which can enable
   impersonation and malicious traffic redirection. The SAVI can be used
   in both IPV4/V6 networks. In the work we presented here, we describe
   the advantages of using SAVI in SIP and the approaches for using SIP
   in networks, whether in the registrar, redirect, and any procedures
   of the SIP protocol .This document describes different deployment
   scenarios, with solutions for when the nodes in the network using the
   SIP to contact each other.

INTERNET DRAFT    SAVI For Session Initiation Protocol <August 28, 2012>


1  Introduction

   This document describes a mechanism to perform IP source address
   validation in SIP. This mechanism performs SAVI to authenticate the
   registration, the redirect and some special circumstances when the
   SIP protocols is executing. The SAVI can prevent IP source address
   spoofing which can enable impersonation and malicious traffic
   redirection. So that the mechanism can check the source IP address of
   the nodes in SIP protocol, according to the mechanism we can keep the
   safety of dynamic configuration and any cast in the SIP.

   There are three main scenarios for different address assignment
   mechanisms in this document. The mechanism is deployed on different
   devices in different scenarios.

   The deployment detail is described in the document.

   When the nodes starts to execute the SIP protocol, it may call SAVI
   in different procedures according to the specific mobility scenario.
   The mechanism to handle the calling is specified in the document
   according to different deployment scenarios.

3  Overview of SIP

   The main operation of SIP is inviting a new user to a call. There are
   several following entities for SIP:

   Proxy Server: receives a request and then transfer it to the current
   location of the caller directly, if there is another server which can
   have more information for the actual location of the caller, the
   proxy transfer request to that server.

   Redirect Server: A redirect server receives the request and informs
   the caller about the next hop server. The caller then contacts the
   next hop server directly.

   User Agent Server: A terminal equipment which be seen both as a user
   agent client and a user agent server; When it acts as a user agent
   client, the client sends message according to the users actions ;
   When it acts as a user agent server, the server receives the messages
   and can decide what to do with it, then it tells users to accept,

   reject or forward the message and sending the response back to the
   caller.

   Registrar Server: The server is used as a database which contains
   locations and the user preferences indicated by the user agents. And
   it will search the users IP address and other relevant information.

   SAVI MIB module (SAVI-MIB) is conformant to SAVI protocol, and is
   designed to: 

   1.Support centralized management and monitoring of SAVI protocol
   instance by standard SNMP protocol.

   2.Support configuration and querying of SAVI protocol parameters.

   3.Support configuration and querying of binding entries. Operators
   may insert and delete static binding entries.

   4.Support querying of filtering entries.



4  Requirements and solutions for SAVI in SIP

   There are two transaction manners of SIP protocol, in the same domain
   and in different domains. We will define SAVI application for both of
   situations. We also use the following tables: the SAVI Filtering
   Table, the SAVI System Table, the SAVI binding table, the SAVI port
   table.


4.1 The communication users in the same domain:

   There will be six steps for the establish of a communication: 

   Step 1: The users register their information and IP address in
   registrar server;(By using the saviObjectsPortIPVersion,
   saviObjectsPortIfIndex)

   Step 2: The user A sends a REQUEST to the proxy server to contact
   user B;(By using the saviObjectsBindingMacAddr,
   saviObjectsBindingState, saviObjectsBindingLifetime)

   Step 3: The proxy server sends a REQUEST to the registrar server to
   get the IP address and information of B and gets the IP address of B;

   Step 4: The proxy server forwards INVITE of A and B;

INTERNET DRAFT    SAVI For Session Initiation Protocol <August 28, 2012>


   Step 5: B sends a RESPONSE to proxy server to ACCEPT the INVITE;

   Step 6: The proxy server transfers the message to A and build the
   session.

   From the Steps above: the source address validation Improvement(SAVI)
   solution could be used in all the IP address verification for SIP.
   (By using the saviObjectsBindingMacAddr, saviObjectsBindingState,
   saviObjectsBindingLifetime)

   In Step 3, we describe source address validation procedure in it like
   this: In this procedure, the IP addresses are assumed to have passed
   the verifications of the register server or other security
   mechanisms. It has the following steps: 

   1. Extract the IP address source(from the function:
   saviObjectsFilteringIpAddress, also testing the
   saviObjectsPortValidationStatus to support the configuration and
   collection of SAVI parameters) and MAC source(from the function:
   saviObjectsFilteringMacAddr) from the registrar server. Test if the
   MAC address in the MAC-IP Mapping Table exists in the MAC-IP pair(by
   checking saviObjectsPortValidationStatus,
   saviObjectsPortDhcpTrustStatus, saviObjectsBindingIpAddress,
   saviObjectsBindingMacAddr, saviObjectsBindingRowStatus). If it does,
   forwards the packet. Or else, go to next step.


   2. Lookup the IP address source in the IP-MAC Mapping Table and check
   if the IP address exists. If yes, compare the MAC address source in
   the entry and the MAC address in the registrar server(from the
   function: saviObjectsBindingTable) ; If no, insert a new entry into
   the IP-MAC Mapping Table and forward the registrar server, compare
   the MAC again. If yes, forward the packet. Else drop the registrar
   server. The functions using in the above also contains the functions
   in the following tables: saviObjectsSystemTable;
   saviObjectsPortTable; saviObjectsBindingTable;
   saviObjectsFilteringTable.
4.2 The communication users in different domains:

   There will be nine steps for the establish of a communication: 

   Step 1: The users register their information and IP address in
   registrar server; (By using the saviObjectsPortIPVersion,
   saviObjectsPortIfIndex)

   Step 2: The user A sends a REQUEST to the proxy server of domain A to
   contact user B; (By using the saviObjectsBindingMacAddr,
   saviObjectsBindingState, saviObjectsBindingLifetime)

INTERNET DRAFT    SAVI For Session Initiation Protocol <August 28, 2012>


   Step 3: The proxy server inquiries the IP address and information of
   B on the redirect server(the redirect server may in domain A or
   domain B or domain A and B);

   Step 4: The redirect server sends the IP address and other
   information of B to the proxy server;

   Step 5: The proxy server gets the IP address of B;

   Step 6: The proxy server forwards INVITE of A to the proxy server of
   domain B; 

   Step 7: B sends a RESPONSE to proxy server of domain B to ACCEPT the
   INVITE; (By using the saviObjectsBindingMacAddr,
   saviObjectsBindingState, saviObjectsBindingLifetime)

   Step 8: The proxy server of domain B transfers the RESPONSE to proxy
   server of domain A; (By using the saviObjectsBindingMacAddr,
   saviObjectsBindingState, saviObjectsBindingLifetime)

   Step 9: The proxy server of domain A forwards the RESPONSE to A and
   builds the session. (By using the saviObjectsBindingMacAddr,
   saviObjectsBindingState, saviObjectsBindingLifetime)

   From the Steps above: the source address validation Improvement(SAVI)
   solution could be used in all the IP address verification for SIP.

   In Step 4 and 5, we describe source address validation procedure in
   it like this: In this procedure, the IP addresses are assumed to have
   passed the verifications of the register server or other security
   mechanisms. It has the following steps:

   1. Extract the IP address source and MAC source from the registrar
   server. Test if the MAC address in the MAC-IP Mapping Table exists in
   the MAC-IP pair. If it does, forwards the packet. Or else, go to next
   step.

   2. Lookup the IP address source in the IP-MAC Mapping Table and check
   if the IP address exists. If yes, compare the MAC address source in
   the entry and the MAC address in the registrar server; If no, insert
   a new entry into the IP-MAC Mapping Table and forward the registrar
   server, compare the MAC again. If yes, forward the packet. Else drop
   the registrar server.

   In Step 3, we describe source address validation procedure in
   redirect server like this: In this procedure, the IP address is
   assumed to have passed the verifications of the redirect server or
   other security mechanisms. It has the following steps:

   1. Extract the IP address source (from the function:
   saviObjectsFilteringIpAddress, also testing the
   saviObjectsPortValidationStatus to support the configuration and
   collection of SAVI parameters) and MAC source (from the function:
   saviObjectsFilteringMacAddr) from the redirect server. Test if the
   MAC address in the MAC-IP Mapping Table exists in the MAC-IP pair(by
   checking saviObjectsPortValidationStatus,
   saviObjectsPortDhcpTrustStatus, saviObjectsBindingIpAddress,
   saviObjectsBindingMacAddr, saviObjectsBindingRowStatus). If it does,
   forwards the packet. Or else, go to next step.

   2. Lookup the IP address source in the IP-MAC Mapping Table and check
   if the IP address exists. If yes, compare the MAC address source in
   the entry and the MAC address in the redirect server(from the
   function: saviObjectsBindingTable); If no, insert a new entry into
   the IP-MAC Mapping Table and forward the redirect server, compare the
   MAC again. If yes, forward the packet. Else drop the redirect server.
   The functions using in the above also contains the functions in the
   following tables: saviObjectsSystemTable; saviObjectsPortTable;
   saviObjectsBindingTable; saviObjectsFilteringTable.

5  Security Considerations

   The security of address allocation methods matters the security of
   this mechanism. Thus it is necessary to improve the security of
   stateless auto-configuration and DHCP firstly.

6 IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA Consideration currently.
