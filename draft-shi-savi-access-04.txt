Abstract

   Internet is always confronted with many security threats based on IP
   address spoofing which can enable impersonation and malicious traffic
   redirection. Unfortunately, the Internet architecture fails to
   provide the defense mechanism. Source Address Validation Improvement
   (SAVI) was developed to prevent IP source address spoofing.
   Especially, the mechanism is essential for ISPs. However, due to the
   diversity of address assignment methods, SAVI solution is also
   different accordingly. This document describes five scenarios of
   ISPs'IPv6 access network, and moreover, states its SAVI requirements
   and tentative solutions accordingly.

Internet-Draft               SAVI Access                      Nov 2013


1. Introduction

   Spoofing of IP source addresses can jeopardize people's privacy,
   enable malicious traffic redirection which causes the network
   topology and traffic information to be leaked out. Further, it will
   be difficult to trace the source host which has forged the packet.
   The Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) method was designed
   to prevent hosts attached to the same link from spoofing each other's
   IP address. It is developed to complement ingress filtering with
   finer-grained, standardized IP source address validation. It is also
   can be deployed easily in networks due to its modularization and
   extensibility.

   ISPs that provide Internet access services, information services and
   value-added services to the customers always have to be confronted
   with many threats enabled by IP source address spoofing, while the
   Internet architecture fails to prevent IP source address spoofing
   [draft-ietf-savi-threat-scope]. So they have an imperative demand to
   apply the mechanism in order to defend the attack and ensure the
   security of its network and customers' privacy.

   Internet Service Provider has multiple access scenarios not limited
   to Ethernet, and usually is deployed with DHCP. Other scenarios such
   as ADSL with PPP and Ethernet with PPP are also popular in the real
   world. Unfortunately, SAVI Switch only works in the scenarios of wire
   or wireless Ethernet and does not support all address assignment
   methods that can be used in access network. There are four address
   assigned methods identified in one of the SAVI documents:

   1. Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLACC) [I-D.ietf-savi-fcfs]

   2. Dynamic Host Control Protocol address assignment (DHCP)
      [I-D.ietf-savi-dhcp]

   3. Secure Neighbor Discovery (SeND) address assignment
      [I-D.ietf-savi-send]

   4. Mix Address assignment methods
      [I-D.ietf-savi-mix]

   Thus, According to different access network scenarios, SAVI should
   adjust its deployment and make improvement to adapt to the real
   situation. This note analyzes five scenarios of ISPs' IPv6 access
   network, and on this basis, gives tentative SAVI solutions
   accordingly.

4. Scenarios for ISPs'IPv6 Access Network

   There are various access methods for ISPs'IPv6 access network. To
   facilitate the deployment of the SAVI method in networks of various
   kinds, the SAVI method is designed to support different IP address
   assignment methods [I-D.ietf-savi-framework]. However, there are
   still some mixed address assignment methods which cannot be supported.
   It is important to note that the deployment of SAVI device has been

   impacted greatly by access network scenarios and its address
   assignment methods.  In order to meet different IP Source Address
   Validation requirements, SAVI solutions may need to be improved to
   adapt to the real situation.

   From the perspective of SAVI deployment, there are five typical
   scenarios of ISPs'IPv6 access network:

   1. Home Residential gateway (HRG) acts as DHCPv6 proxy.

   2. Set Top-box (STB) gets an IP address via DHCPv6.

   3. Host gets IP address via PPPoE & RA.

   4. Laptop accesses Internet via WLAN.

   5. Laptop accesses Internet via C+W.

   We will discuss the SAVI solution for each scenario in detail in the
   next section.

   Figure 1 shows the main elements in scenario 1. PC and STB connect to
   the Internet via HRG. Its address assignment mechanism can be
   described as follows: First, HRG gets a link-local IPv6-IPv6 address
   from BRAS via PPPoE and ND/RA. Then, HRG gets an IPv6 address from
   BRAS via DHCPv6-PD. At last, PC and STB get IPv6 addresses from HRG

   via DHCPv6. Of course, PC and STB can also get IPv6 addresses via
   ND/RA, but the DHCPv6 is much more popular.

   According to the SAVI mechanism, in order to achieve Source Address
   Validation, the SAVI device must snoop the whole procedure of Address
   assignment. In addition, the preferred location of SAVI instances is
   close to hosts, such as in access switches that directly attach to
   the hosts where host IP addresses are being validated [I-D.ietf-savi-
   framework]. So we can deploy the SAVI device in places close to the
   HRG, such as the first hop access device. It can be illustrated in
   figure 2.

   Figure 2 shows the deployment of SAVI device. It also allows multiple
   SAVI devices and non-SAVI devices co-existing on a link. In addition,
   for this solution, the SAVI mechanism needs to improve to snoop the
   procedure of DHCPv6-PD, so as to bind the relationship <HRG/PC/STB's
   IP address, port, MAC>.

4.2. Scenario 2: STB gets an IP address via DHCPv6

   The difference between scenario 1 and scenario 2 is the absence of HG
   which acts as DHCPv6 proxy. In scenario 2, STB, having its internal
   account and password gets IPv6 prefix by DHCPv6. The general scene
   workflow includes the following steps: STB sends requests to all
   routers on a local link by using a link-local address based on its
   MAC address. The BRAS gives a message to STB to adopt DHCPv6 address
   assignment method as a response. STB initiates the DHCPv6 procedure
   and BRAS acts as a DHCP Relay to add some authorities' messages. An
   AAA server decides whether assign address parameters depend on the
   result of authentication. At last, BRAS receives IPv6 parameters from
   AAA server, and then, informs STB via DHCPv6 protocol. It can be
   illustrated in figure 3.

                            Figure 3: Scenario2


   Figure 3 shows the main elements in scenario 2. Due to the pure
   DHCPv6 address assignment method in this scenario, we can deploy SAVI
   device in places close to STB directly and SAVI mechanism need not
   make any improvement. It just needs to bind relationship <STB's IP
   Address, port, STB's MAC Address> which is supported in the existing
   SAVI function. The solution can be illustrated in figure 4.

   configures its address automatically and gets some additional
   messages from BRAS.

   account. Thus, the solution to this scenario which is illustrated in
   figure 6 is to deploy the SAVI device directly and binding
   relationship <PC's IP Address, port, PC's MAC>. In this scenario,
   SAVI needs to improve in order to realize PPPoE snooping.

4.4. Scenario 4: Laptop accesses Internet via public WLAN

   The interaction in this scenario is relatively simple. The laptop
   gets an IPv6 address via DHCPv6. Then, users are enforced to be
   certified by submitting a password on a portal page.

4.5. Scenario 5: Laptop accesses Internet via C+W

   This scenario describes that the laptop accesses the Internet via
   CDMA and WLAN. The general scene workflow includes the following
   steps: The laptop gets a temporary IPv6 address from BARS via DHCPv6,

   and then, obtains the WAG address from a DNS server. The laptop
   establishes a UDP tunnel to WAG by sending register request. If the
   tunnel is established successfully, the laptop can get IPv6 prefix
   from PDSN via PPP and RA, whereas PDSN acts as the PPP terminal. At
   last, the laptop gets some additional information such as the DNS
   address. When the above steps are all accomplished, the laptop
   acquires the ability to access the Internet.

   Figure 9 shows the main elements in scenario 5. in this scenario, we
   also can deploy the SAVI device in places close to the LAPTOP. SAVI
   needs to improve to support the PPPoE protocol snooping. It also
   binds relationship <LAPTOP's IP Address, port, LAPTOP's MAC>. The
   solution is described in figure 10.

5. Conclusions

   For ISPs, SAVI can defend against many security attacks effectively
   which are based on IP address spoofing. There are various scenarios
   of ISPs'IPv6 Access Network. As each scenario uses a different
   address assignment method and protocol, there are a variety of
   requirements to validate the source address for ISPs' IPv6 access
   network. Though SAVI cannot support all protocols and methods right
   now, due to expansibility of SAVI, the mechanism can satisfy various
   demands with a small improvement. This document presents five typical
   scenarios of ISPs'IPv6 access network, and proposes tentative SAVI
   solutions.

   Moreover, for functional verification, we conducted an experiment on
   China Telecom's access network in Hunan province. The experimental
   results show that source addresses can be validated effectively as we
   expected in most access scenarios. Next, we will deploy more SAVI
