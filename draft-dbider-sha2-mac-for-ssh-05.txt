Abstract

   This memo defines algorithm names and parameters for use of some of
   the SHA-2 family of secure hash algorithms for data integrity
   verification in the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.  It also updates
   RFC4253 by specifying a new RECOMMENDED data integrity algorithm.

Internet-Draft              SHA-2 MAC for SSH               January 2012


   described in the Simplified BSD License.


1.  Overview and Rationale

   Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC4251] is a very common protocol for secure
   remote login on the Internet.  Currently, SSH defines data integrity
   verification using SHA-1 and MD5 algorithms [RFC4253].  Due to recent
   security concerns with these two algorithms [RFC6151][RFC6194],
   implementors and users request support for data integrity
   verification using some of the SHA-2 family of of secure hash
   algorithms.

   Please send comments on this draft to ietf-ssh@NetBSD.org.

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Data Integrity Algorithms

   This memo adopts the style and conventions of [RFC4253] in defining
   new data integrity algorithms.

   The following new data integrity algorithms are defined:

   hmac-sha2-256     RECOMMENDED   HMAC-SHA2-256
                                   (digest length = 32 bytes,
                                    key length    = 32 bytes)

   hmac-sha2-256-96  OPTIONAL      first 96 bits of HMAC-SHA2-256
                                   (digest length = 12 bytes,
                                    key length    = 32 bytes)

   hmac-sha2-512     OPTIONAL      HMAC-SHA2-512
                                   (digest length = 64 bytes,
                                    key length    = 64 bytes)

   hmac-sha2-512-96  OPTIONAL      first 96 bits of HMAC-SHA2-512
                                   (digest length = 12 bytes,
                                    key length    = 64 bytes)

                                 Figure 1

   The HMAC mechanism was originally defined in [RFC2104] and has been

Internet-Draft              SHA-2 MAC for SSH               January 2012


   updated in [RFC6151].

   The SHA-2 family of secure hash algorithms are defined in
   [FIPS-180-3].

   Sample code for the SHA-based HMAC algorithms are available in
   [RFC6234].  The variants HMAC-SHA2-224 and HMAC-SHA2-384 algorithms
   were considered, but not added to this list as they have the same
   computational requirements of HMAC-SHA2-256 and HMAC-SHA2-512
   respectively and do not seem to be much used in practice.

   The truncated -96 OPTIONAL forms are present to allow applications
   which may be space restricted to still interoperate and make use of
   the new hashes.

   Test vectors for use of HMAC with SHA-2 are provided in [RFC4231].

   Users, implementors, and administrators may choose to put these new
   Macs into the proposal ahead of the REQUIRED hmac-sha1 algorithm
   defined in [RFC4253] so that they would be negotiated first.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document augments the MAC Algorithm Names in [RFC4253] and
   [RFC4250].

   IANA is requested to update the SSH algorithm registry with the
   following entries:

   MAC Algorithm Name      Reference       Note
   hmac-sha2-256           This draft      Section 2
   hmac-sha2-256-96        This draft      Section 2
   hmac-sha2-512           This draft      Section 2
   hmac-sha2-512-96        This draft      Section 2

                                 Figure 2


4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of RFC 4253 [RFC4253] apply to this
   document.

   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
   publications: NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-107 [800-107] and
   NIST SP 800-131A [800-131A] suggest that HMAC-SHA1 and HMAC-SHA2-256
   have a security strength of 128 bits and 256 bits respectively which

   are considered acceptable key lengths.

   Many users seem to be interested in the perceived safety of using the
   SHA2-based algorithms for hashing.
