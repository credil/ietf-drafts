              DHCP DNS Public Authoritative Server Option
        draft-mglt-dhc-public-authoritative-server-option-00.txt

Abstract

   The home network naming architecture as described in
   [I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation] requires a complex
   naming configuration on the CPE.  This configuration MAY not be
   handled easily by the average end user.  Furthermore, such
   misconfiguration MAY result in making home network unreachable.

   This document proposes a DHCP option that provides the CPE all
   necessary parameters to set up the home network naming architecture.

   First, this DHCP option provides automatic configuration and avoids
   most end users' misconfigurations.  Most average end users may not
   require specific configuration, and their ISP default configuration
   MAY fully address their needs.  In that case, the naming homenet
   architecture configuration will be completely transparent to the end
   users.  Then, saving naming configuration outside the CPE, makes it
   resilient to change of CPE or CPE upgrades.  Such configuration may
   also be configured by the end user, via the customer area of their
   ISP.

Internet-Draft     DHCP DNS Public Auth. Server Option         July 2013


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   - Customer Premises Equipment:   (CPE) is the router providing
         connectivity to the home network.  It is configured and managed
         by the end user.  In this document, the CPE MAY also hosts
         services such as DHCPv6.  This device MAY be provided by the
         ISP.

   -  Registered Homenet Domain:   is the Domain Name associated to the
         home network.

   - DNS Homenet Zone:   is the DNS zone associated to the home network.
         This zone is set by the CPE and essentially contains the
         bindings between names and IP addresses of the nodes of the
         home network.  In this document, the CPE does neither perform
         any DNSSEC management operations such as zone signing nor
         provide an authoritative service for the zone.  Both are
         delegated to the Public Authoritative Server.  The CPE
         synchronizes the DNS Homenet Zone with the Public Authoritative
         Server via a hidden master / slave architecture.  The Public
         Authoritative Server MAY use specific servers for the
         synchronization of the DNS Homenet Zone: the Public
         Authoritative Name Server Set.

   - Public Authoritative Server:   performs DNSSEC management
         operations as well as provides the authoritative service for
         the zone.  In this document, the Public Authoritative Server
         synchronizes the DNS Homenet Zone with the CPE via a hidden
         master / slave architecture.  The Public Authoritative Server
         acts as a slave and MAY use specific servers called Public
         Authoritative Name Server Set. Once the Public Authoritative
         Server synchronizes the DNS Homenet Zone, it signs the zone and
         generates the DNSSEC Public Zone.  Then the Public
         Authoritative Server hosts the zone as an authoritative server
         on the Public Authoritative Master(s).

   - DNSSEC Public Zone:   corresponds to the signed version of the DNS
         Homenet Zone.  It is hosted by the Public Authoritative Server,
         which is authoritative for this zone, and is reachable on the
         Public Authoritative Master(s).

Internet-Draft     DHCP DNS Public Auth. Server Option         July 2013


   - Public Authoritative Master(s):   are the visible name server
         hosting the DNSSEC Public Zone.  End users' resolutions for the
         Homenet Domain are sent to this server, and this server is a
         master for the zone.

   - Public Authoritative Name Server Set:   is the server the CPE
         synchronizes the DNS Homenet Zone.  It is configured as a slave
         and the CPE acts as master.  The CPE sends information so the
         DNSSEC zone can be set and served.

3.  Introduction

   With IPv6, nodes inside the home network are expected to be globally
   reachable.  CPEs are already providing connectivity to the home
   network, and most of the time already assigns IP addresses to the
   nodes of the home network using for example DHCPv6.

   This makes CPE good candidate for defining the DNS zone file of the
   home network.  However, CPEs have not been designed to handle heavy
   traffic, nor heavy operations.  As a consequence, CPE SHOULD neither
   host the authoritative naming service of the home network, nor handle
   DNSSEC operations such as zone signing.  In addition, CPE are usually
   managed by end users, and the average end user is most likely not
   mastering DNSSEC to administrate its DNSSEC zone.  As a result, CPE
   SHOULD outsource both the naming authoritative service and its DNSSEC
   management operations to a third party.  This architecture,
   designated as the homenet naming architecture is described in
   [I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation], and the third party
   is designated as the Public Authoritative Servers.

   The home network naming architecture defines how the CPE and the
   Public Authoritative Servers interact together, so to leverage some
   of the issues related to the CPE, and the DNSSEC understanding of the
   average end user.  Even though most of the DNSSEC issues are
   outsourced to the Public Authoritative Servers, setting the homenet
   naming architecture still requires some configurations.

   Configuration is fine as it provides the opportunity for advanced end
   users to make the naming architecture fit their specific needs.
   However most of the end users do not want to configure the homenet
   naming architecture.  In most cases, the end users wants to subscribe
   and plug its CPE.  The CPE is expected to be configured to set
   automatically and transparently the appropriated home network naming
   architecture.

   Using DHCP options to provide the necessary parameters for setting
   the homenet naming architecture provides multiple advantages.
   Firstly, it makes the network configuration independent of the CPE.

Internet-Draft     DHCP DNS Public Auth. Server Option         July 2013


   Any new plugged CPE configures itself according to the provided
   configuration parameters.  Secondly, it saves the configuration
   outside the CPE, which prevents re-configuring the CPE when it is
   replaced or reset.  Finally ISPs are likely to propose a default
   homenet naming architecture that may address most of the end users
   needs.  For these end users, no configuration will be performed at
   any time.  This avoids unnecessary configurations or misconfiguration
   that could result in isolating the home network.  For more advanced
   end users, the configuration MAY be provided also via the web GUI of
   the ISP's customer area for example.  This configuration MAY enable
   third party Public Authoritative Servers.  By doing so, these end
   users will also benefit from CPE-indepedent configuration and
   configuration backup.

   This document considers the architecture described in
   [I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation].  The DNS(SEC) zone
   related to the home network is configured and set by the CPE and
   hosted on a Public Authoritative Server.
   [I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation] describes how the
   synchronization between the CPE and the Public Authoritative Server
   is performed.  This document describes the DNS Public Authoritative
   Server DHCP option (DNS_PUBLIC_AUTHORITATIVE_SERVER) that provides
   the necessary parameters to the CPE to set the architecture described
   in [I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation].

   Section 4 presents an overview of the DNS Public Authoritative Server
   DHCP option (DNS_PUBLIC_AUTHORITATIVE_SERVER) and Section 5 describes
   the format of this option and Section 6 details the exchange between
   the CPE and the DHCPv6 Server.

   This document assumes the reader is familiar with
   [I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation].

   This document assumes that the communication between the CPE and the
   ISP DHCP Server is protected.  This document does not specify which
   mechanism should be used.  [RFC3315] proposes a DHCP authentication
   and message exchange protection, [RFC4301], [RFC5996] proposes to
   secure the channel at the IP layer.

   This document only deals with IPv6 IP addresses and DHCPv6 [RFC3315].
   When we mention DHCP, it MUST be understood as DHCPv6.

4.  Protocol Overview

   The CPE requests the necessary parameters to set its home network
   naming configuration to the DHCP server.  The DHCP server MAY be, for
   example, the one of its ISP, that already provides the IPv6 prefix to
   the CPE.

Internet-Draft     DHCP DNS Public Auth. Server Option         July 2013


   The CPE sends an Option Request DHCP Option (ORO) [RFC3315] for the
   DHCP DNS Public Authoritative Server Option
   (DNS_PUBLIC_AUTHORITATIVE_SERVER)

   If available, the DHCP server sends back one or more DHCP DNS Public
   Authoritative Server Option (DNS_PUBLIC_AUTHORITATIVE_SERVER),
   depending if the end user has registered to one or multiple Public
   Authoritative Servers.

   A CPE MAY be associated to one or multiple Registered Homenet Domain
   and one or multiple Public Authoritative Servers.  The CPE builds a
   zone for each Registered Homenet Domain.  These zones are uploaded /
   synchronized with their associated Public Authoritative Servers.
   Note that synchronization is performed through master / slave
   configuration of the DNS servers, thus Public Authoritative Servers
   are configured to host specific Registered Homenet Domains.  On the
   other hand, a given Homenet Zone MAY be hosted by multiple Public
   Authoritative Servers.  The CPE MUST build properly the DNS Homenet
   Zone and synchronize properly the hidden master and slaves for the
   synchronizations.

   In order to configure properly the DNS Homenet Zone, the CPE SHOULD
   collect the list of Registered Homenet Domain and their associated
   Public Authoritative Servers.  For each Registered Homenet Domain,
   the CPE lists the Public Authoritative Servers FQDN and set them as
   authoritative Name Server (RRset NS) for the zone.  The CPE MAY also
   add in the DNS Homenet Zone their IP addresses (RRsets A or AAAA).
   This FQDN and IP addresses associated are designated as the Public
   Authoritative Master(s).

   Note that how the CPE manage the multiple DNS Homenet Zones is
   implementation dependent.  It MAY synchronize all DNS Homenet Zone
   with the Public Authoritative Servers, or use zone redirection
   mechanisms like like CNAME [RFC2181], [RFC1034], DNAME [RFC6672] or
   CNAME+DNAME [I-D.sury-dnsext-cname-dname].  In the first case, any
   update requires to update all zone, whereas redirection MAY require
   only updating a single DNS Homenet Zone.

   In order to synchronize the DNS Homenet Zone with a Public
   Authoritative Server, the CPE needs to know how to establish a secure
   channel with the Public Authoritative Server.  The Public
   Authoritative Server MAY have dedicated servers working as slave to
   synchronize the DNS Homenet Zone with the CPE.  These servers are
   called Public Authoritative Name Server Set. In addition to these
   servers, the CPE MUST know which security protocol can be used to
   secure the channel as well as the security credential.  In this
   document, we only considered Pre-Shared Key (PSK).

   As a result, the DHCP DNS Public Authoritative Server Option
   (DNS_PUBLIC_AUTHORITATIVE_SERVER) carries:

   -  Registered Homenet Domain List:  the list of Registered Homenet
         Domain the Public Authoritative Server hosts.

   - Master :  the Public Authoritative Master(s), that is to say the
         FQDNs provided in the NS RRsets of the Homenet Zones associated
         to each of the Registered Homenet Domains.  IP addresses are
         derived by the CPE thanks to a DNS(SEC) resolutions.

   - Secure Channel:  the Public Authoritative Name Server Set , that is
         the FQDN the CPE MUST securely synchronize its DNS Homenet Zone
         with.  This field MUST also specify, the security protocol as
         well as the security material.

Internet-Draft     DHCP DNS Public Auth. Server Option         July 2013


   - name-server-set:  Public Authoritative Name Server Set encoded as
         specified in [RFC1035].  Only the FQDN representation is
         considered in this document.

6.  Exchange Details

   This section details the DHCPv6 exchange between the DHCPv6 server
   and the CPE.

6.1.  DHCPv6 Server

   The DHCPv6 server MUST NOT send a DHCP DNS Public Authoritative
   Server Option (DNS_PUBLIC_AUTHORITATIVE_SERVER) if not requested by
   the CPE through the DHCP Option Request Option (ORO).

   In the remaining of this section we suppose the DHCPv6 Server has
   received a DHCP Option Request Option (ORO) from the CPE for a DHCP
   DNS Public Authoritative Server Option
   (DNS_PUBLIC_AUTHORITATIVE_SERVER).

   If the DHCPv6 Server does not understand the DHCP DNS Public
   Authoritative Server Option, it ignores the Option as specified in
   [RFC3315].

   If the DHCPv6 has no specific configuration, it MUST return a DHCP
   DNS Public Authoritative Server Option with the len registered-
   domain-list-len, master-list-len and secure-channel-list-len set to
   zero.  This response is called the Zero Response and indicates that
   there are not enough arguments to set the home network architecture.

   The registered-domain-list is mandatory.  If it does not exists, and
   Zero Response MUST be sent.

   A zero length for master-list indicates the CPE hosts the zone.  In
   this case, a zero length secure-channel-list is expected.

6.2.  CPE

   In this section we assume the CPE has sent a DHCP Option Request
   Option (ORO) from the CPE for a DHCP DNS Public Authoritative Server
   Option (DNS_PUBLIC_AUTHORITATIVE_SERVER).

   An Zero Response indicates the DHCPv6 Server has not a specific
   configuration for the CPE.

   A response with an registered-domain-list set to zero MUST be
   ignored.

   A zero length for master-list indicates the CPE hosts the zone.  A
   non zero length secure-channel-list MUST be ignored.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The DHCP options detailed in this document is:

   - OPTION_DNS_PUBLIC_AUTH_SERVER:  TBD

   The payload detailed in this document are:

   - fqdn:  TBD

   - secure-channel:  TBD

   The security-protocol detailed in this document are:

   - NONE:  TBD

   - TSIG:  TBD

   - IPSEC:  TBD

   The security-credential detailed in this document are:

   - NONE:  TBD

   - PSK:  TBD

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  DNSSEC is recommended to authenticate DNS hosted data

   The document describes how the Secure Delegation can be set between
   the Delegating DNS Server and the Delegated DNS Server.

   Deploying DNSSEC is recommended since in some cases the information
   stored in the DNS is used by the ISP or an IT department to grant
   access.  For example some Servers may performed a PTR DNS query to
   grant access based on host names.  With the described Delegating
   Naming Architecture, the ISP or the IT department MUST take into
   consideration that the CPE is outside its area of control.  As such,
   with DNS, DNS responses may be forged, resulting in isolating a
   Service, or not enabling a host to access a service.  ISPs or IT
   department may not base their access policies on PTR or any DNS
   information.  DNSSEC fulfills the DNS lack of trust, and we recommend
   to deploy DNSSEC on CPEs.

8.2.  Channel between the CPE and ISP DHCP Server MUST be secured

   In the document we consider that the channel between the CPE and the
   ISP DHCP Server is trusted.  More specifically, we suppose the CPE is
   authenticated and the exchanged messages are protected.  The current
   document does not specify how to secure the channel.  [RFC3315]
   proposes a DHCP authentication and message exchange protection,
   [RFC4301], [RFC5996] propose to secure the channel at the IP layer.

   In fact, the channel MUST be secured because the CPE provides
   necessary information for the configuration of the Naming Delegation.
   Unsecured channel may result in setting the Naming Delegation with an
   non legitimate CPE.  The non legitimate CPE would then be redirected
   the DNS traffic that is intended for the legitimate CPE.  This makes
   the CPE sensitive to three types of attacks.  The first one is the
   Deny Of Service Attack, if for example DNS traffic for a lot of CPEs
   are redirected to a single CPE.  CPE are even more sensitive to this
   attack since they have been designed for low traffic.  The other type
   of traffic is the DNS traffic hijacking.  A malicious CPE may
   redirect the DNS traffic of the legitimate CPE to one of its server.
   In return, the DNS Servers would be able to provide DNS Responses and
   redirect the End Users on malicious Servers.  This is particularly
   used in Pharming Attacks.  A third attack may consists in isolating a
   Home Network by misconfiguring the Naming Delegation for example to a
   non-existing DNS Server, or with a bad DS value.

8.3.  CPEs are sensitive to DoS

   The Naming Delegation Architecture involves the CPE that hosts a DNS
   Server for the Home Network.  CPE have not been designed for handling
   heavy load.  The CPE are exposed on the Internet, and their IP
   address is publicly published on the Internet via the DNS.  This
   makes the Home Network sensitive to Deny of Service Attacks.  The
   Naming Delegation Architecture described in this document does not
   address this issue.  The issue is addressed by
   [I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation].
