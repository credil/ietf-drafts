Abstract

   This specification defines a generic simplified mechanism to use
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) with large portions of
   negotiation aspects eliminated, and to allow full and partial
   reachability validations.  For MPLS based BFD, extensions to the
   generic mechanism are defined for BFD to perform a level of label
   verifications.

Internet-Draft              Seamless BFD Base                  June 2013


1.  Introduction

   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD), [RFC5880] and related
   documents, has efficiently generalized the failure detection
   mechanism for multiple protocols and applications.  There are some
   improvements which can be made to better fit existing technologies.
   There are also possibility of evolving BFD to better fit new
   technologies.  This document focuses on several aspects of BFD in
   order to further improve efficiency, to expand failure detection
   coverage and to allow BFD usage for wider scenarios.

   o  There are scenarios where only one side of the BFD, not both, is
      interested in performing reachability validations.  One example is
      when static route uses BFD to validate nexthop IP address.
      Another example is when uni-directional tunnel uses BFD to
      validate reachability to egress node.  With these scenarios,
      corresponding BFD sessions need to be provisioned or instantiated
      on target nodes but adds very minimal value to those nodes, if
      any.

   o  It is expected that some MPLS technologies will require traffic
      engineered LSPs to get created dynamically, driven by external
      applications (ex: SDN).  If BFD was to perform reachability
      validations on LSP prior to requested network node communicating
      back to the application of LSP readiness, then it would be
      desirable for BFD to come up fast in order to allow requesting
      application to proceed.  [RFC5884] can take some time as BFD
      sessions need to get created on both ends, egress via LSP ping,
      and then session negotiations take place.

   o  Existing BFD mechanics provides end-to-end reachability
      validations well.  It does not, however, allow BFD to perform
      partial reachability validations: ingress to transit, transit to
      transit, transit to egress.

   o  [RFC5884] defines a mechanism to run BFD on exiting MPLS
      technologies.  This mechanism is very useful to perform end-to-end
      LSP liveliness verification check.  However, this mechanism lacks
      the ability to validate traversal of the intended LSP path.
      Specifically when one or more nodes along the LSP incorrectly
      label switch the BFD packet, but it still manages to reach the
      intended LSP egress node.  Likelihood of this issue being seen
      depends on deployed MPLS technologies.  With MPLS technologies
      which make use of downstream label allocation scheme (ex: RSVP,
      LDP), incoming label itself provides a level of check as a node
      will drop any packet containing non-self-advertised label as the
      top label or will get delivered to unintended egress node.  For
      those MPLS technologies, issue will be less likely to be seen.

Internet-Draft              Seamless BFD Base                  June 2013


      With MPLS technologies such as Segment Routing (SR), incoming
      label can often be a label allocated and advertised by a node that
      is multiple downstream hops away.  For such MPLS technologies,
      issue will be more likely to be seen.  [RFC4379] can detect such
      broken LSPs, but it is often difficult to run this technology at
      the rate which BFD is capable of.

   o  A node may desire to run multiple BFD sessions to a network
      target.  One such scenario is if multiple applications on the
      system required to run BFD to a same target but with different
      failure detection time requirements.  Another scenario is to run
      multiple instances of BFD, hosted on different parts of the system
      (ex: different CPUs), to a same network target, in order to
      increase BFD failure reliability by reducing the chance of
      unrelated local fault causing BFD to declare failure.

   This specification provides solutions to above aspects by defining a
   generic simplified mechanism to use Bidirectional Forwarding
   Detection (BFD) with large portions of negotiation aspects
   eliminated, and to allow full and partial reachability validations.
   For MPLS based BFD, extensions to the generic mechanism are defined
   for BFD to perform a level of label verifications.

   The reader is expected to be familiar with the BFD, IP, MPLS and SR
   terminologies and protocol constructs.

2.  Seamless BFD Overview

   Seamless BFD creates packet reflection points in the network.  A
   network node is able to send BFD control packets to these reflection
   points, and expect response BFD control packets.  These reflection
   points are called BFD target identifiers.  Pseudo BFD session
   instances, referred to as reflector BFD sessions, created on BFD
   target identifiers are responsible for processing "ping" BFD control
   packets and generating "pong" BFD control packets.

3.  BFD Target Identifier Types

   Number of network identifiers types (ex: IP address, segment ID) can
   make use of this mechanism.  To differentiate between different
   network identifier types, a value is assigned to each type.

   BFD Target Identifier types:

      Value    BFD Target Identifier Type
     ------    --------------------------
          0    Reserved
          1    IP (IPv4 Address and Router ID)

          2    Segment Routing Node Segment ID


   Note that IP based BFD from [RFC5885] is supported by this
   specification, but IP-less based BFD is outside the scope of this
   document.

   Further identifier types to be defined as needed basis.

4.  Reserved BFD Discriminators

   All local network identifiers which are to participate in this
   mechanism are to have specific BFD discriminators assigned.  Assigned
   BFD discriminators are attached to corresponding identifiers until
   they are explicitly un-provisioned.  BFD discriminators used for this
   mechanism are considered reserved, and MUST NOT be reused for other
   BFD sessions.

   Some examples of network identifier to BFD discriminator mappings:

   o  BFD Target Identifier Type 1: IPv4 address 1.1.1.1 maps to BFD
      discriminator 0x01010101.

   o  BFD Target Identifier Type 2: Node segment ID 0x03E800FF maps to
      BFD discriminator 0x03E800FF.

   It is possible, although foreseen to be extremely rare, for
   identifiers of different BFD target identifier types to map to same
   BFD discriminator.  How such conflict is to be resolved is outside
   the scope of this document.

5.  BFD Target Identifier Table

   Each network node is responsible for creating and maintaining a table
   that contains BFD discriminators, BFD target identifier types and BFD
   target identifiers.  Intention of this table is to allow local
   entities to perform following lookups:

   o  BFD discriminator to BFD target identifier type and BFD target
      identifier

   o  BFD target identifier type and BFD target identifier to BFD
      discriminator

   This table MUST contain entries for all locally reserved BFD
   discriminators and corresponding information.  This table MAY need to
   contain entries from other network nodes, depending on the BFD target
   identifier type.

6.  Reflector BFD Session

   Each network node MUST create one or more reflector BFD sessions.
   This reflector BFD session is a session which transmits BFD control
   packets in response to received valid locally destined BFD control
   packets.  Specifically, this reflector BFD session is to have
   following characteristics:

   o  Does not transmit any BFD control packets based on local timer
      expiry.

   o  Transmits BFD control packet in response to received valid locally
      destined BFD control packet.

   o  Capable of sending only two states: UP and ADMINDOWN.

   One reflector BFD session can be responsible for handling response to
   received BFD control packets targeted to all local BFD target
   identifiers, or few reflector BFD sessions can each be responsible
   for subset of local BFD target identifiers.  This policy is a local
   matter, and is outside the scope of this document.

   In addition, a reflector BFD session MUST be address family agnostic.
   Single reflector BFD session MUST be able to handle incoming BFD
   control packets in IPv4 and IPv6, and MUST be able to respond with
   BFD control packets using same address family as received packets.

7.  Full Reachability Validations

7.1.  Initiator Behavior

   Any network node can attempt to perform a full reachability
   validation to any BFD target identifier on other network nodes, as
   long as destination BFD target identifier is provisioned to use this
   mechanism.  Transmitted BFD control packet by the initiator is to
   have "your discriminator" corresponding to destination BFD target
   identifier.

   A node that initiates a BFD control packet can create an active BFD
   session to periodically send BFD control packet to a target, or BFD
   control packet can be crafted and sent out on "as needed basis" (ex:
   BFD ping) without any session presence.  In both cases, a BFD
   instance MUST have unique "my discriminator" value assigned.  If a
   node is to create multiple BFD instances to a same BFD target
   identifier, then each instance MUST have separate "my discriminator"
   values assigned.

   If BFD control packet is to be sent via IP path, then:

Internet-Draft              Seamless BFD Base                  June 2013


   o  Destination IP address MUST be an IP address corresponding to
      target identifier.
   o  Source IP address MUST be a local IP address.
   o  IP TTL MUST be 255 for full reachability validations.  Partial
      reachability validations MAY use smaller TTL value (see
      Section 8).
   o  One of well-known UDP destination ports for IP based BFD: 3784 for
      singlehop, 4784 for multihop, 6784 for BFD for LAG

   If BFD control packet is to be sent via explicit label switching,
   then:

   o  BFD control packet MUST get imposed with a label stack that is
      expected to reach the target node.
   o  MPLS TTL MUST be 255 for full reachability validations.  Partial
      reachability validations MAY use smaller TTL value (see
      Section 8).
   o  Destination IP address MUST be 127/8 for IPv4 and
      0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 for IPv6.
   o  Source IP address MUST be a local IP address.
   o  IP TTL=1.
   o  Well-known UDP destination port for MPLS based BFD: 3784

7.2.  Responder Behavior

   A network node which receives BFD control packets transmitted by an
   initiator is referred as responder.  Responder, upon reception of BFD
   control packets, is to perform necessary relevant validations
   described in [RFC5880]/[RFC5881]/[RFC5883]/[RFC5884]/[RFC5885].

7.2.1.  Responder Demultiplexing

   When responder receives a BFD control packet, if "your discriminator"
   value is not one of local entries in the BFD target identifier table,
   then this packet MUST NOT be considered for this mechanism.  If "your
   discriminator" value is one of local entries in the BFD target
   identifier table, then the packet is determined to be handled by a
   reflector BFD session responsible for specified BFD targeted
   identifier.  If the packet was determined to be processed further for
   this mechanism, then chosen reflector BFD session is to transmit a
   response BFD control packet using procedures described in
   Section 7.2.2, unless prohibited by local administrative or local
   policy reasons.

7.2.2.  Reflector BFD Session Procedures

   BFD target identifier type MUST be used to determine further
   information on how to reach back to the initiator.

Internet-Draft              Seamless BFD Base                  June 2013


   In addition, destination IP address of received BFD control packet
   MUST be examined to determine how to construct response BFD control
   packet to send back to the initiator.

   If destination IP address of received BFD control packet is not 127/8
   for IPv4 or 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 for IPv6, then:

   o  Destination IP address MUST be copied from received source IP
      address.
   o  Source IP address MUST be copied from received destination IP
      address if received destination IP address is a local address.
      Otherwise local IP address MUST be used.
   o  IP TTL MUST be 255.

   If destination IP address of received BFD control packet is 127/8 for
   IPv4 or 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 for IPv6, then received IP
   destination MUST be further examined to determine response transport
   options.  If last 23 bits of 127/8 for IPv4 and 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/
   104 for IPv6 is zero, then response SHOULD be label switched but MAY
   be IP routed.  If last 23 bits of 127/8 for IPv4 and
   0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 for IPv6 is not zero, then response SHOULD be
   label switched and SHOULD NOT be IP routed.  Description of 23 bits
   is described in Section 9.

   If BFD control packet response is determined to be IP routed, then:

   o  Destination IP address MUST be copied from received source IP
      address.
   o  Source IP address MUST be a local address.
   o  IP TTL MUST be 255.

   If BFD control packet response is determined to be label switched,
   then:

   o  BFD control packet MUST get label switched back to the initiator.
      How label stack to be imposed on a response BFD control packet is
      determined for all cases is outside the scope of this document.
   o  MPLS TTL MUST be 255.
   o  Destination IP address MUST be 127/8 for IPv4 and
      0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 for IPv6.
   o  Source IP address MUST be a local IP address.
   o  IP TTL MUST be 1.

   Regardless of the response type, BFD control packet being sent by the
   responder MUST perform following procedures:

   o  Copy "my discriminator" from received "your discriminator", and
      "your discriminator" from received "my discriminator".

   o  UDP destination port MUST be same as received UDP destination
      port.

7.3.  Further Packet Details

   Further details of BFD control packets sent by initiator (ex: active
   BFD session):

   o  UDP destination port described in [RFC5881]/[RFC5883]/[RFC5884]/
      [RFC5885].
   o  UDP source port as per described in [RFC5881]/[RFC5883]/[RFC5884]/
      [RFC5885].
   o  "my discriminator" assigned by local node.
   o  "your discriminator" corresponding to an identifier of target
      node.
   o  "State" MUST be set to a value reflecting local state.
   o  "Desired Min TX Interval" MUST be set to a value reflecting local
      desired minimum transmit interval.
   o  "Required Min RX Interval" MUST be zero.
   o  "Required Min Echo RX Interval" SHOULD be zero.
   o  "Detection Multiplier" MUST be set to a value reflecting locally
      used multiplier value.

   Further details of BFD control packets sent by responder (reflector
   BFD session):

   o  UDP destination port described in [RFC5881]/[RFC5883]/[RFC5884]/
      [RFC5885].
   o  UDP source port as per described in [RFC5881]/[RFC5883]/[RFC5884]/
      [RFC5885].
   o  "my discriminator" MUST be copied from received "your
      discriminator".
   o  "your discriminator" MUST be copied from received "my
      discriminator".
   o  "State" MUST be UP or ADMINDOWN.  Usage of ADMINDOWN state is
      described in Section 7.6.
   o  "Desired Min TX Interval" MUST be copied from received "Desired
      Min TX Interval".
   o  "Required Min RX Interval" MUST be set to a value reflecting how
      many incoming control packets this reflector BFD session can
      handle.
   o  "Required Min Echo RX Interval" SHOULD be set to zero.
   o  "Detection Multiplier" MUST be copied from received "Detection
      Multiplier".

   Simple ASCII art is provided to illustrate the concept described so
   far.

7.4.  Diagnostic Values

   Diagnostic value in both directions MAY be set to a certain value, to
   attempt to communicate further information to both ends.  However,
   details of such are outside the scope of this specification.

7.5.  Additional Initiator Behavior

   o  If initiator receives valid BFD control packet in response to
      transmitted BFD control packet, then initiator SHOULD conclude
      that packet reached intended target.

   o  How many repeated absence of response should make initiator
      consider loss of reachability, and what action would be triggered
      as result are outside the scope of this specification.

7.6.  Additional Responder Behavior

   o  BFD control packets transmitted by a reflector BFD session MUST
      have "Required Min RX Interval" set to a value which reflects how
      many incoming control packets this reflector BFD session can
      handle.  Responder can control how fast initiators will be sending
      BFD control packets to self by ensuring "Required Min RX Interval"
      reflects a value based on current load.

   o  If a reflector BFD session wishes to communicate to some or all
      initiators that monitored BFD target identifier is "temporary out
      of service", then BFD control packets with "state" set to
      ADMINDOWN are sent to those initiators.  Initiators, upon
      reception of such packets, MUST NOT conclude loss of reachability
      to corresponding BFD target identifier, and MUST back off packet
      transmission interval to corresponding BFD target identifier an
      interval no faster than 1 second.

8.  Partial Reachability Validations

   Same mechanism as described in "Full Reachability Validations"
   section will be applied with exception of following differences on
   initiator.

   o  When initiator wishes to perform a partial reachability validation
      towards identifier X on identifier Y, number of hops to identifier
      Y is calculated.

   o  TTL value based on this calculation is used as the IP TTL or MPLS
      TTL on top most label, and "your discriminator" of transmitted BFD
      control packet will carry BFD discriminator corresponding to
      target transit identifier Y.

   o  Imposed label stack or IP destination address will continue to be
      of identifier X.

9.  MPLS Label Verifications

   This section is only applicable to MPLS based sessions using this
   mechanism.

9.1.  MPLS Label Verifications Mechanism

   With full and partial reachability validations, initiator has the
   ability to determine if target identifier received the packet on any
   interfaces.  This section describes additional mechanism for
   initiator to determine if target identifier received the packet on a
   specific interface.

   So far for MPLS based sessions, this mechanism makes use of
   destination IP address of 127/8 range for IPv4 and of
   0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range for IPv6, in both directions.  In this
   section, 127/8 will be used to describe the MPLS label verification
   mechanism.  However, same concept is to be applied to IPv6 range
   0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104.

   When a network node wishes to perform MPLS label verification, BFD
   control packet will have lower 23 bits of 127/8 destination IP
   address embedded with (label value + EXP) that is used to reach
   intended target identifier.  Receiver of this BFD control packet, if
   last 23 bits of 127/8 address is not zero, then will embed
   information reflecting how the packet was received in the lower 23
   bits of 127/8 destination IP address in the response BFD control
   packet.  If responder received the BFD control packet on a non-point-
   to-point interface, source MAC address MAY need to be examined to
   determine the "RX info" to embed in the returning packet.

   9th bit is reserved for the time being and SHOULD be set to zero and
   SHOULD be ignored on receipt, by both initiator and responder

   Initiator receiving back a response will know that packet did reach
   intended identifier.  Initiator can also look into lower 23 bits of
   IP destination address in received BFD control packet to determine if
   packet sent was received by intended identifier in expected way (ex:
   expected RX interface).

   When (label + EXP) is being encoded, label is specified in higher 20
   bits of 23 bits and EXP is specified in lower 3 bits of 23 bits.

   If a response BFD control packet is received, then initiator can
   conclude that a packet has reached intended node correctly.  With
   information embedded in last 23 bits of response BFD control packet
   from responder, initiator has the ability to perform further
   verifications on how responded node received BFD control packet.

9.2.  Localhost Address Usage

   Last 23 bits of 127/8 for IPv4 and 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 for IPv6
   being non-zero is the trigger for responder to embed RX information
   in the response.  When initiator is performing only reachability
   validations to target identifiers, then last 23 bits of the localhost
   address MUST be zero.  This is to ensure unnecessary processing at
   responder is eliminated.

10.  Scaling Aspect

   This mechanism brings forth one noticeable difference in terms of
   scaling aspect: number of BFD sessions.  This specification
   eliminates the need for egress nodes to have fully active BFD
   sessions when only side is desired to perform reachability
   validations.  With introduction of reflector BFD concept, egress no
   longer is required to create any active BFD session per path/LSP
   basis.  Due to this, total number of BFD sessions in a network is
   reduced.

   If traditional BFD technology was used on a network comprised of N
   nodes, and each node monitored M uni-directional paths/LSPs, then
   total number of BFD sessions in such network will be:

   (((N - 1) x M) x 2)

   Assuming that each network node creates one reflector BFD session to
   handle all local BFD target identifiers, then total number of BFD
   sessions in same scenario will be:

   (((N - 1) x M) + N)

11.  Co-existence with Traditional BFD

   This mechanism has no issues being deployed with traditional BFDs
   ([RFC5881]/[RFC5883]/[RFC5884]/[RFC5885]) because BFD discriminators
   which allow this mechanism to function are explicitly reserved.

12.  BFD Echo

   BFD echo is outside the scope of this document.

13.  Security Considerations

   Same security considerations as [RFC5880], [RFC5881], [RFC5883],
   [RFC5884] and [RFC5885] apply to this document.

   Additionally, implementing following measures will strengthen
   security aspects of this mechanism described by this document.

   o  Implementations MUST provide filtering capability based on source
      IP addresses or source node segment IDs of received BFD control
      packets: [RFC2827].

   o  Implementations MUST NOT act on received BFD control packets
      containing Martian addresses as source IP addresses.

   o  Implementations MUST ensure response target IP addresses or node
      segment IDs are reachable.

14.  IANA Considerations

   BFD Target Identifier types:

      Value    BFD Target Identifier Type
     ------    --------------------------
          0    Reserved
          1    IP (IPv4 Address and Router ID)
          2    Segment Routing Node Segment ID
