1.  Introduction

   RFC2671 [RFC2671] specifies an extension mechanism for DNS.  This
   document describes an EDNS option to allow for arbritry data to be
   inserted into a DNS Request and have that same data be returned in a
   DNS Reply.  This functionality can be used to increase the effective
   size of the ID field [RFC1035, Section 4.1.1 [RFC1035]] and to aid in
   diagnostics.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Use cases

2.1.  Increasing the size of the ID space

   The Header section of the DNS Message format contains a 16-bit ID
   field (see [RFC1035, Section 4.1.1 [RFC1035]).  This field is used to
   match replies to their queries.  If an attacker is able to predict
   this field he may be able to spoof a reply and perform a DNS cache
   poisining attack.  By inserting arbritary data into the ECHO OPTION-
   DATA in a query (and checking that the same data is returned in the
   response), an iterative resolver can protect itself against this type
   of attack.  Note that the resolver needs to add additional steps to
   protect against a downgrade attack.  This technique does not protect
   against a man in the middle attack.

   To avoid maintaining additional state for each query, the sender can
   algorithmically generate the ECHO OPTION-DATA.  As an example it
   could generate this data field by calculating a hash over the
   concatenation of various fileds (such as the QNAME and the ID field)
   and a secret.


3.  ECHO Option format

   The OPTION-CODE for the ECHO option is TBD.

   The OPTION-DATA for the ECHO option is an opaque byte string, the
   semantics of which are deliberately left outside the protocol.

   The OPTION-DATA only has meaning to the sender.  The software that
   generates the response or any intermediate device SHOULD NOT try and
   infer anything from the data.

3.1.  Presentation format

   User interfaces MUST read and write the contents of the ECHO option
   as a sequence of hexadecimal digits, two digits per payload octet.
   The ECHO payload is binary data.  Any comparison between ECHO
   payloads MUST be a comparison of the raw binary data.  Copy
   operations MUST NOT assume that the raw payload is null-terminated.


4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to assign a value from the "DNS EDNS0 Options"
   registry, setting the name to be "ECHO" and referencing this
   document.

   The code for the option should be TBD.


5.  Security Considerations

   A common form of denial of service attack is the reflected DNS
   amplification attack.  In this attack an attacker spoofs DNS requests
   from the victim that will result in a much larger reply (the
   amplification factor).  While the attacker could include a large
   amount of data in the ECHO payload of the spoofed DNS requests, this
   doesn't create any amplification.

   The ECHO option could be used for DNS tunneling and exfiltration of
   data.


6.  Acknowledgements
