Internet-Draft     Candidate Address Selection for ICE         July 2012


1.  Introduction

   When Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] [RFC6544]
   is used for NAT traversal, both endpoints gather multiple IP
   addresses and ports, also called candidate addresses, and test for
   connectivity between them.  One of the principles of ICE is to gather
   all possible candidate addresses and pair them with all the addresses
   of the peer in order to test all combinations and get high
   probability for successful NAT traversal.

   A prioritization formula is used by ICE so that most preferred
   address pairs are tested first, and if a sufficiently good pair is
   discovered, the tests can be stopped.  Addresses obtained from local
   network interfaces, called host candidates, are recommended as high-
   priority ones to be tested first since if they work, they provide
   usually the best path between the two hosts.  With IPv4 this approach
   works well since interfaces usually have just a single unicast IP
   address.  However, with IPv6 addressing architecture [RFC4291]
   interfaces commonly have multiple addresses: global, link-local,
   Unique Local (ULA) [RFC4193], etc.

   The ICE specification recommends to use the rules defined in
   [RFC3484] as part of the prioritization formula for IPv6 candidates,
   but does not give much further advice on how to handle different kind
   of IPv6 addresses.  However, if all different kind of IPv6 addresses
   are paired with each other, some of the combinations will never work
   and may unnecessarily delay the completion of the ICE process.

   This document updates the ICE rules defined in [RFC5245] and
   [RFC6544] on how candidate addresses are selected and how they should
   be combined with each other in order to maintain high performance for
   the ICE NAT traversal process.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the same terminology as ICE (see Section 3 of
   [RFC5245]) and the following:

   Local relayed candidate: a relayed candidate (obtained, e.g., from a
   TURN server) and included in an ICE offer or answer the agent has or
   will send.

3.  Changes to Candidate Address Selection

   This document proposes the following updates to the rules for
   selecting and combining IPv6 candidate addresses:

   o  Instead of RFC 3484 rules, the rules defined in
      [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484bis] MUST be used for determining the
      candidate priorities.  If operating system address preferences are
      available (e.g,. via appropriate API extension), those SHOULD be
      used instead of default preferences.

   o  Deprecated IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses [RFC4291] and IPv6 site-
      local unicast addresses [RFC3879] MUST NOT be included in the
      address candidates.

   o  Candidate addresses from link-local addresses MUST NOT be combined
      with any other candidates except other link-local candidates.

   o  Candidate addresses from Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) MUST NOT be
      combined with any other candidates except other ULA candidates.

   o  IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses MUST NOT be included in the offered
      candidates unless the application using ICE does not support IPv4
      (i.e., is an IPv6-only application [RFC4038]).

   The following updates pertain to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:

   o  Addresses from a loopback interface MUST NOT be included in the
      candidate addresses.

   o  Local relayed candidates MUST NOT be combined with remote host
      candidates from IPv4 private address space [RFC1918] or IPv6 link-
      local addresses or ULAs.


4.  Negotiating Address Selection Scheme

   The prioritization method for the candidate address pairs used by ICE
   results in matching checklists for both endpoints and hence both
   endpoints start the checks for the same candidate pair roughly at the
   same time.  This is important since in many scenarios a connectivity
   check initiated by both endpoints for the same pair is needed before
   a check for the pair succeeds.  Also, some NAT devices have very
   short timeouts for their address translation bindings and a binding
   created by a connectivity check from one endpoint may expire before
   the corresponding connectivity check from the other endpoint is sent
   if there is a long delay between the two checks.

Internet-Draft     Candidate Address Selection for ICE         July 2012


   Depending on how different candidates are paired and whether RFC 3484
   or the revised version of it [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484bis] is used, the
   endpoints may end up with different priorities and checklists.
   Therefore, the endpoints need to agree on how the address selection
   and pairing is done.

   To indicate that the address selection and pairing rules defined in
   this document are used, the ICE offerer MUST include ice-options
   attribute with "bis-candidates" option identifier in the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] ICE offer.  If the ICE offer
   does not include this option tag, the answerer SHOULD NOT utilize the
   updated rules defined in this document.  If the offer included the
   option tag and the answerer supports this specification, the answerer
   SHOULD add the same option tag to the response and use the updated
   rules.

   If the ICE answer does not contain the option tag, the offerer SHOULD
   NOT use the updated rules.  However, even if the other endpoint does
   not indicate support for the updated rules, loopback addresses or the
   deprecated IPv6 addresses SHOULD NOT be included in the candidates.


5.  Security Considerations

   The general security considerations for ICE have been documented in
   Section 18 of [RFC5245] and Section 12 of [RFC6544].  The general
   security considerations for IPv6 address selection rules have been
   documented in [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484bis].  The vulnerabilities in ICE
   and RFC3484bis relate to attempts to hijack sessions opened through
   ICE, denial-of-service attacks, and accidental disclosure of private
   information.  Mechanisms described in [RFC5245] and [RFC6544] - such
   as validated TCP connections - are designed to protect against
   connection hijacking.

   Denial-of-service attacks can not be completely eliminated, but the
   amplification capabilities of ICE are limited through a maximum value
   of concurrently probed connections.

   Any address probing mechanism opens up the possibility of outsiders
   learning the correlation between different IP addresses.  For
   instance, the existence of a privacy address [RFC4941] in the
   candidate set along with other, more stable addresses will tell at
   least the peer and maybe eavesdroppers that the addresses are
   related.

   This specification introduces no specific new security concerns
   beyond these, as it only attempts to unify the algorithms associated
   with candidate address pair selection.  However, where address

Internet-Draft     Candidate Address Selection for ICE         July 2012


   selection rules in a node are configured through an external
   mechanism, as suggested in [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484bis], this opens up
   another avenue for introducing incorrect addresses into the probing
   mechanism.  The resulting system is only as secure as its weakest
   component.  For instance, even if sufficient security mechanisms are
   in place in ICE, vulnerabilities in the configuration mechanisms for
   the 3484bis priority tables may introduce weaknesses in the ability
   of ICE to select the right addresses.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register "bis-candidates" option identifier
   under the "ICE Options" [RFC6336] registry.  The required
   registration information is as follows:

      Option identifier: bis-candidates

      Contact: Ari Keranen, ari.keranen@ericsson.com

      Change control: IETF

      Description: Existence of this option identifier indicates that
      the revised rules (defined in RFCXXXX) are used for candidate
      address selection.
