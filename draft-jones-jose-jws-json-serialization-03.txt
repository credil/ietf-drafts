             JSON Web Signature JSON Serialization (JWS-JS)
               draft-jones-jose-jws-json-serialization-03

Abstract

   The JSON Web Signature JSON Serialization (JWS-JS) is a means of
   representing content secured with digital signatures or Message
   Authentication Codes (MACs) using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
   data structures.  This specification describes a means of
   representing secured content as a JSON data object (as opposed to the
   JWS specification, which uses a compact serialization with a URL-safe
   representation).  It enables multiple digital signatures and/or MACs
   to be applied to the same content (unlike JWS).  Cryptographic
   algorithms and identifiers used with this specification are described
   in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) specification.  The JSON
   Serialization for related encryption functionality is described in
   the separate JSON Web Encryption JSON Serialization (JWE-JS)
   specification.

Internet-Draft       JWS JSON Serialization (JWS-JS)       November 2012


1.  Introduction

   The JSON Web Signature JSON Serialization (JWS-JS) is a format for
   representing content secured with digital signatures or Message
   Authentication Codes (MACs) as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
   [RFC4627] object.  It enables multiple digital signatures and/or MACs
   to be applied to the same content (unlike JWS [JWS]).  The digital
   signature and MAC mechanisms used are independent of the type of
   content being secured, allowing arbitrary content to be secured.
   Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers used with this specification
   are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA]
   specification.  The JSON Serialization for related encryption
   functionality is described in the separate JSON Web Encryption JSON
   Serialization (JWE-JS) [JWE-JS] specification.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the same terminology as the JSON Web
   Signature (JWS) [JWS] specification.


3.  JSON Serialization

   The JSON Serialization represents secured content as a JSON object
   with a "recipients" member containing an array of per-recipient
   information and a "payload" member containing a shared Encoded JWS
   Payload value.  Each member of the "recipients" array is a JSON
   object with a "header" member containing an Encoded JWS Header value
   and a "signature" member containing an Encoded JWS Signature value.

   Unlike the compact serialization used by JWSs, content using the JSON
   Serialization MAY be secured with more than one digital signature
   and/or MAC value.  Each is represented as an Encoded JWS Signature
   value in the "signature" member of an object in the "recipients"
   array.  For each, there is an Encoded JWS Encoded Header value in the
   "header" member of the same object in the "recipients" array.  This
   specifies the digital signature or MAC applied to the Encoded JWS
   Header value and the shared Encoded JWS Payload value to create the
   JWS Signature value.  Therefore, the syntax is:

     {"recipients":[
       {"header":"<header 1 contents>",
        "signature":"<signature 1 contents>"},
       ...
       {"header":"<header N contents>",
        "signature":"<signature N contents>"}],
      "payload":"<payload contents>"
     }

   The contents of the Encoded JWS Header, Encoded JWS Payload, and
   Encoded JWS Signature values are exactly as specified in JSON Web
   Signature (JWS) [JWS].  They are interpreted and validated in the
   same manner, with each corresponding "header" and "signature" value
   being created and validated together.

   Each JWS Signature value is computed on the JWS Secured Input
   corresponding to the concatenation of the Encoded JWS Header, a
   period ('.') character, and the Encoded JWS Payload in the same
   manner described in the JWS specification.  This has the desirable
   result that each Encoded JWS signature value in the "recipients"
   array is identical to the value that would be used for the same
   parameters in a JWS.


4.  Example JWS-JS

   This section contains an example using the JWS JSON Serialization.
   This example demonstrates the capability for conveying multiple
   digital signatures and/or MACs for the same payload.

   The Encoded JWS Payload used in this example is the same as used in
   the examples in Appendix A of JWS (with line breaks for display
   purposes only):

     eyJpc3MiOiJqb2UiLA0KICJleHAiOjEzMDA4MTkzODAsDQogImh0dHA6Ly9leGFt
     cGxlLmNvbS9pc19yb290Ijp0cnVlfQ

   Two digital signatures are used in this example: an RSA SHA-256
   signature, for which the header and signature values are the same as
   in Appendix A.2 of JWS, and an ECDSA P-256 SHA-256 signature, for
   which the header and signature values are the same as in Appendix A.3
   of JWS.  The two Decoded JWS Header Segments used are:

     {"alg":"RS256"}

   and:

     {"alg":"ES256"}

Internet-Draft       JWS JSON Serialization (JWS-JS)       November 2012


   Since the computations of the JWS Header and JWS Signature values are
   the same as in Appendix A.2 and Appendix A.3 of JWS, they are not
   repeated here.

   The complete JSON Web Signature JSON Serialization (JWS-JS) for these
   values is as follows (with line breaks for display purposes only):

     {"recipients":[
       {"header":"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9",
        "signature":
         "cC4hiUPoj9Eetdgtv3hF80EGrhuB__dzERat0XF9g2VtQgr9PJbu3XOiZj5RZ

          LIhWkWywlVmtVrBp0igcN_IoypGlUPQGe77Rw"},
       {"header":"eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiJ9",
        "signature":
         "DtEhU3ljbEg8L38VWAfUAqOyKAM6-Xx-F4GawxaepmXFCgfTjDxw5djxLa8IS
          lSApmWQxfKTUJqPP3-Kg6NU1Q"}],
      "payload":
       "eyJpc3MiOiJqb2UiLA0KICJleHAiOjEzMDA4MTkzODAsDQogImh0dHA6Ly9leGF
        tcGxlLmNvbS9pc19yb290Ijp0cnVlfQ"
     }


5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification makes no requests of IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for this specification are the same as
   those for the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] specification.
