       <t>Portions of the radio spectrum that are allocated to a licensed, primary user but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as "white space".  The concept of allowing secondary transmissions (licensed or unlicensed) in white space is a technique to "unlock" existing spectrum for new use.  An obvious requirement is that these secondary transmissions do not interfere with the primary use of the spectrum. One approach to using the white space spectrum at a given time and location is to verify with a database available
channels.

       <t>This document describes the concept of TV White Spaces. It also describes the problems that need to be addressed for enabling the use of the primary user owned white space spectrum for secondary users, without causing interference, by querying a database which knows the channel availability at any given location and time. A number of possible use cases of this spectrum and derived requirements are also described.

       <t>
       Wireless spectrum is a commodity that is regulated by
       governments. The spectrum is used for various purposes, which
       include entertainment (e.g. radio and television), communication
       (telephony and Internet access), military (radars etc.) and,
       navigation (satellite communication, GPS). Portions of the
       radio spectrum that are allocated to a licensed, primary user but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as "white space". The concept of allowing secondary transmissions (licensed or unlicensed) in white space is a technique to "unlock" existing spectrum for new
       use. An obvious requirement is that these secondary
       transmissions do not interfere with the primary use of the
       spectrum. One interesting observation is that often, in a given
       physical location, the primary user(s) may not be using the
       entire band allocated to them.  The available spectrum for a
       secondary use would then depend on the location of the
       secondary user.  The fundamental issue is how to 
       determine for a specific location and specific time, if any of
       the primary spectrum is available for secondary use. Academia
       and Industry have studied multiple cognitive radio mechanisms
       for use in such a scenario. One simple mechanism is to use a
       geospatial database that records the primary users occupation,
       and require the secondary users to check the database prior to
       selecting what part of the spectrum they use.  Such databases
       could be available on the Internet for query by secondary
       users.
       </t>
      <t>Spectrum useable for data communications, especially wireless
	Internet communications, is scarce. One area which has
	received much attention globally is the TV white space:
	portions of the TV band that are not used 
	by broadcasters in a given area. In 2008 the United States
	regulator (the FCC) took initial steps when 
	they published their first ruling on the use of TV white space,
	and then followed it up with a final ruling in
	2010 <xref target="FCC Ruling"/>. Finland
	passed an Act in 2009 enabling testing of cognitive radio
	systems in the TV white space. The ECC has completed Report
	159 <xref target="ECC Report 159"/>
	containing requirements for operation of cognitive radio systems
	in the TV white space.  Ofcom published in 2004 their Spectrum
	Framework Review <xref target="Spectrum Framework Review" />
	and their Digital Dividend Review <xref target="DDR"/> in 2005, 
	and have followed up with a proposal to access TV white
	space.  More countries are expected to provide access to their
	TV spectrum in similar ways.  Any entity holding spectrum that
	is not densely used may be asked to give it up in one way or
	another for more intensive use.  Providing a mechanism by
	which secondary users share the spectrum with the primary user
	is attractive in many bands in many countries.</t>

      <t>Television transmission until now has primarily been analog.  The switch to
   digital transmission has begun.  As a result the spectrum allocated
   for television transmission can now be more effectively used.  Unused
   channels and bands between channels can be used as long as they do
   not interfere with the primary service for which that channel is
   allocated.  While urban areas tend to have dense usage of spectrum
   and a number of TV channels, the same is not true in rural and semi-urban areas.  There can be a number of unused TV channels in such
   areas that can be used for other services.  The figure below shows TV
   white space within the lower UHF band:</t>

   <t>The fundamental issue is how to determine
	for a specific location and specific time if any of the spectrum
	is available for secondary use. There are two dimensions of
	use that may be interesting: space (the area in which a
	secondary user would not interfere with a primary user, and
	time: when the secondary use would not interfere with the
	primary use. In this discussion, we consider the time element
	to be relatively long term (hours in a day) rather than short
	term (fractions of a second).  Location in this discussion is
	geolocation: where the transmitters (and sometimes receivers)
	are located relative to one another.  In operation, the
	database records the existing user's transmitter (and some
	times receiver) locations along with basic transmission
	characteristics such as antenna height, and sometimes power.
	Using rules established by the regulator, the database
	calculates an exclusion zone for each authorized primary user,
	and attaches a time schedule to that use.  The secondary user
	queries the database with its location.  The database
	intersects the exclusion zones with the queried location, and
	returns the portion of the spectrum not in any exclusion zone.
	Such methods of geospatial database query to avoid
	interference have been shown to achieve favorable results, and
	are thus the basis for rulings by the FCC and reports from ECC
	and Ofcom. In any country, the rules for which primary
	entities are entitled to protection, how the exclusion zones
	are calculated, and what the limits of use by secondary
	entities are may vary.  However, the fundamental notion of
	recording primary users, calculating exclusion zones, querying
	by location and returning available spectrum (and the schedule
	for that spectrum) are common</t>

      <section title="The concept of Cognitive Radio">
	<t>
	  A cognitive radio uses knowledge of the local radio
	  environment to dynamically adapt its own configuration and
	  function properly in a changing radio environment. Knowledge
	  of the local radio environment can come from various
	  technology mechanisms including sensing (attempting to ascertain primary users by listening for them within the spectrum), location determination and
	  internet connectivity to a database to learn the details of
	  the local radio environment.  TV White Space is one implementation of cognitive
	  radio. Because a cognitive radio adapts itself to the
	  available spectrum in a manner that prevents the creation of
	  harmful interference, the spectrum can be shared among
	  different radio users.

    <section title="Background information on white space in US">
     <t>
       Television transmission in the United States has moved to the
       use of digital signals as of June 12, 2009. Since June 13,
       2009, all full-power U.S. television stations have broadcast
       over-the-air signals in digital only. An important benefit of
       the switch to all-digital broadcasting is that it freed up
       parts of the valuable broadcast spectrum. More information
       about the switch to digital transmission is at :
       <xref target="DTV" />.
       </t>
     <t>
       With the switch to digital transmission for TV, the guard bands
       that existed to protect the signals between stations can now be
       used for other purposes. The FCC has made this spectrum
       available for unlicensed use and this is generally referred to
       as white space. Please see the details of the FCC ruling and
       regulations in <xref target="FCC Ruling" />. The spectrum can
       be used to provide wireless broadband as an example. The term
       "Super-Wifi" is also used to describe this spectrum and
       potential for providing wifi type of service. 
     </t>
     </section>
     <section title = "Air Interfaces">
       <t>Efforts are ongoing to specify air-interfaces for use in white
       space spectrum. IEEEs 802.11af task group is currently working
       on one such specification. IEEE 802.22 is another
       example. Other air interfaces could be specified in the future
       such as LTE. 
       </t>

    </section>
    </section>
   <section title="Use cases">
     <t>
       There are many potential use cases that could be considered for
       the TV white space spectrum. Providing broadband internet access
       in hotspots, rural and underserved areas are examples. Available
       channels may also be used to provide internet 'backhaul' for traditional
       Wi-Fi hotspots, or by towns and cities to monitor/control traffic
       lights or read utility meters. Still other use cases include the ability
       to offload data traffic from another internet access network (e.g. 3G
       cellular network) or to deliver location based services. Some
       of these use cases are described in the following sections.
     </t>

     <section anchor="discovery" title="TVWS database discovery">
       <t>This use case is preliminary to creating a radio network using TV white space; it is a prerequisite to other use cases. The radio network is created by a master device. Before the master device can transmit in TV white space spectrum, it  must contact a trusted database where the device can learn if any channels are available for it to use. The master device will need to discover a trusted database in the relvant regulatory domain, using the following steps:</t>
       <t>
         <list style="numbers">
	   <t>The master device is connected to the internet by any means other than using the TV white space radio.</t>
	   <t>The master device constructs and sends a service request over the Internet to discover availability of trusted databases in the local domain and waits for responses.</t>
           <t>If no acceptable response is received within a pre-configured time limit, the master device concludes that no trusted database is available. If at least one response is received, the master device evaluates the response(s) to determine if a trusted database can be identified where the master device is able to register and receive service from the database.</t>
         </list>
       </t>

       <t>Optionally the radio device is pre-programmed with the internet address of at least one trusted database. The device can establish contact with a trusted database using one of the pre-programmed internet addresses and establish a TV white space network (as described in one of the following use cases).</t>
       <t>Optionally the initial query will be made to a listing approved by the national regulator for the domain of operation (e.g. a website either hosted by or under control of the national regulator) which maintains a list of TVWS databases and their internet addresses. The query results in the list of databases and their internet addresses being sent to the master, which then evaluates the repsonse to determine if a trusted database can be identified where the master device is able to register and receive service from the database.
       </t>

     </section>


     <section anchor="registration" title="Device registration with trusted Database">
       <t>This use case is preliminary to creating a radio network using TV white space; it is a prerequisite to other use cases. The radio network is created by a master device. Before the master device can transmit in TV white space spectrum, it must contact a trusted database where the device can learn if any channels are available for it to use. Before the database will provide information on available TV channels, the master device must register with the trusted database. Specific requirements for registration come from individual regulatory domains and may be different.</t>

     <section title="Hotspot: urban internet connectivity service">

       <t>In this use case internet connectivity service is provided in a "hotspot" to local users. Typical deployment scenarios include urban areas where internet connectivity is provided to local businesses and residents, and campus environments where internet connectivity is provided to local buildings and relatively small outdoor areas. This deployment scenario is typically characterized by multiple masters (APs or hotspots) in close proximity, with low antenna height, cells with relatively small radius (a few kilometers or less), and limited numbers of available radio channels. Many of the masters/APs are assumed to be individually deployed and operated, i.e. there is no coordination between many of the masters/APs. The masters/APs in this scenario use a TDD radio technology and transmit at or below a relatively low transmit power threshold. Each master/AP has a connection to the internet and provides internet connectivity to multiple master and or slave devices.</t>

     <section title="Wide-Area or Rural internet broadband access">

       <t>In this use case, internet broadband access is provided as a Wide-Area Network (WAN) or Wireless Regional Area Network (WRAN). A typical deployment scenario is a wide area or rural area, where internet broadband access is provided to local businesses and residents from a master (i.e. BS) connected to the internet. This deployment scenario is typically characterized by one or more fixed master(s)/BS(s), cells with relatively large radius (tens of kilometers, up to 100 km), and a number of available radio channels. Some of the masters/BSs may be deployed and operated by a single entity, i.e. there can be centralized coordination between these masters/BSs, whereas other masters/BSs may be deployed and operated by operators competing for the radio channels in a license-exempt TVWS environment where decentralized coordination using the air-interface would be required. The BS in this scenario use a TDD radio technology and transmit at or below a transmit power limit established by the local regulator. Each base station has a connection to the internet and  provides internet connectivity to multiple slave/end-user devices. End user terminals or devices may be fixed or portable.</t>

       <t>The figure below shows an example deployment of this scenario.

       <t>Once the master/BS has been professionally installed and configured, a simplified power up and operation scenario utilizing TV White Space to provide rural internet broadband access consists of the following steps:
       </t>
       <t>
         <list style="numbers">
	   <t>The master/BS powers up; however its WS radio and all
	    other WS capable devices will power up in idle/listen only
	    mode (No active transmissions on the WS frequency band)
	   </t>
	   <t>The master/BS has internet connectivity and
	    establishes a connection to a trusted white space database
	    (see use case "TVWS database discovery" above).
	   </t>
	   <t>The master/BS registers its geolocation, address, contact information, etc.  associated with the owner/operator of the master/BS with the trusted database service (if not currently registered, see <xref target="registration" />). Meanwhile the DB administrator may be required to store and forward the registration information to the regulatory authority. If a trusted white space database administrator is not discovered, further operation of the WRAN may be allowed according to local regulator policy (in this case operation of the WRAN is outside the scope of the PAWS protocol).
	   </t>
	   <t>Following the registration process, the master/BS will send a
	    query to the trusted database requesting a list of
	    available WS channels based upon its geolocation.
	   </t>
	   <t>If the master/BS has been previously authenticated, the database responds with a list of available white space channels that may be used and optionally a maximum transmit power (EIRP) for each channel and a duration of time the channel may be used.
	   </t>
	   <t>Once the master/BS authenticates the WS channel list response message from the database, the master/BS selects an available WS channel(s) from the list. The operator may disallow some channels from the list to suit local needs if required. 
	   </t>
           <t>The slave or user device scans the TV bands to locate a WRAN transmission, and associates with the master/BS. The slave/user device provides its geolocation to the BS which, in turn, queries the database for a list of channels available at the slaves' geolocation.
           </t>
           <t>Once this list of available channels is received from the database by the master, the latter will decide, based on the list of available channels for all its other associated slaves whether it should continue operation on its current channel or change channel to accommodate the new slave in case this channel is not available at its location. The master will notify all its associated slaves/user devices of the new channel to move to if operation needs to change channel. If the channel that the user terminal is currently using is not included in the list of locally available channels, the master will drop its association with the slave/user device so that it ceases all operation on its current channel and indicate the new operating channel before dropping the link if a change has been decided. The slave/user device may move to the indicated new channel if so indicated or scan for another WRAN transmission on a different channel.

     <section title="Offloading: moving traffic to a white space network">

       <t>In this use case internet connectivity service is provided over TV white space as a supplemental or alternative datapath to a 3G or other internet connection. In a typical deployment scenario an end user has a primary internet connection such as a 3G cellular packet data subscription. The user wants to use a widget or application to stream video from an online service (e.g. youtube) to their device. Before the widget starts the streaming connection it checks connectivity options available at the current time and location. Both 3G cellular data is available as well as TVWS connectivity (the user is within coverage of a TVWS master -- hotspot, WAN, WRAN or similar). The user may decide for many and various reasons such as cost, RF coverage, data caps, etc. to prefer the TVWS connection over the 3G cellular data connection. Either by user selection, preconfigured preferences, or other algorithm, the streaming session is started over the TVWS internet connection instead of the 3G cellular connection. This deployment scenario is typically characterized by a TVWS master/AP providing local coverage in the same geographical area as a 3G cellular system. The master/AP is assumed to be individually deployed and operated, i.e. the master/AP is deployed and operated by the user at his home or perhaps by a small business such as a coffee shop. The master/AP has a connection to the internet and provides internet connectivity to the slave/end-user's device.</t>

     <section title="TVWS for backhaul">

       <t>In this use case internet connectivity service is provided to users over a traditional wireless protocol, one common example is Wi-Fi. The TV white space network provides the "backhaul" or connection from the Wi-Fi to the internet. In a typical deployment scenario an end user has a device with a radio such as Wi-Fi. A service provider or shop owner wants to provide Wi-Fi internet service for their customers. The location where the service provider wants to provide Wi-Fi is within range of a TVWS master (e.g. Hotspot or Wide-Area/Rural network). The service provider installs a TVWS slave device and connects this slave to a Wi-Fi access point. This deployment scenario is typically characterized by a TVWS master/AP/BS providing local coverage. The master/AP has a connection to the internet and provides internet connectivity to the slave device. The slave device is then 'bridged' to a Wi-Fi network</t>

     <section title="Rapid deployed network for emergency scenario">
       <t>Organizations involved in handling emergency operations often have a
fully owned and controlled infrastructure, with dedicated spectrum,
for day to day operation. However, lessons learned from recent
disasters show such infrastructures are often highly affected by the
disaster itself. To set up a replacement quickly, there is a need for
fast reallocation of spectrum, where in certain cases spectrum can be
freed for disaster relief.
To utilize free or freed spectrum quickly and reliable, automation of
allocation, assignment and configuration is needed. A preferred option
is make use of a robust protocol, already adopted by radio
manufacturers. This approach does in no way imply such organizations
for disaster relief must compete on spectrum allocation with other
white spaces users, but they can.
A typical network topology would include wireless access links to the
public Internet or private network, wireless ad hoc network radios
working independent of a fixed infrastructure and satellite links for
backup where lack of coverage, overload or outage of wireless access
links occur.</t>

       <t>In the ad hoc network, all nodes are master nodes in a way that they
allocate RF channels from the white space database. However, the
backhaul link may not be available to all nodes, such as depicted
for the left node in the figure. To handle RF channel allocation for
such nodes, a master node with a backhaul link relays or proxies the
database query for them. So master nodes without a backhaul link
follow the procedure as defined for clients.
The ad hoc network radios utilise the provided RF channels. Details on
forming and maintenance of the ad hoc network, including repair of
segmented networks caused by segments operating on different RF
channels, is out of scope of spectrum allocation.</t>

         <list style="numbers">
	   <t>The mobile master device powers up with its WS radio in idle or listen mode only (no active transmission on the WS frequency band).</t>

           <t>The mobile master registers with  the trusted database according to regulatory domain requirements (see <xref target="registration" />).</t>
           <t>Following the registration process, the mobile master will send a query to the trusted database requesting a list of available WS channels based upon its current location and a prediction of its future location, extrapolated from the motion or mobility of the device. The current location is specified in latitude and longitude. The method to specify the future location is TBD, potential methods include movement vector (direction and velocity), a set of latitude/longitude points which specify a closed polygon where the future location is within the polygon, or similar.</t>
           <t>If the mobile master has met all regulatory domain requirements (e.g. been previously authenticated, etc), the database responds with a list of available white space channels that the mobile master may use, and optional information which may include (1) a duration of time for the use of each channel (2) a maximum transmit power for each channel.</t>
           <t>Once the mobile master has met all regulatory domain requirements (e.g. authenticated the WS channel list response message from the database, etc), the master selects an available WS channel(s) from the list for use.</t>
           <t>The other user device in the peer-to-peer connection scans the TV bands to locate a mobile master transmission, and associates with the mobile master.

    <section title="Problem Statement">
	<t>
	  The use of white space spectrum is enabled via the
	  capability of a device to query a database and obtain
	  information about the availability of spectrum for
	  use at a given location. The databases are reachable via the
	  Internet and the devices querying these databases are expected
	  to have some form of Internet connectivity, directly or indirectly. The databases
	  may be country specific since the available spectrum and
	  regulations may vary, but the fundamental operation of the protocol should be country independent.
	  </t>

      </t>								      

	  <t>
	    In the figure above, note that there could be multiple
	    databases serving white space devices. The databases are
	    country specific since the regulations and available
	    spectrum may vary. In some countries, for example, the U.S., the regulator has determined that multiple, competing databases may provide service to White Space Devices.
	    </t>
	  <t>
	    A messaging interface between the white space devices and
	    the database is required for operating a network using the
	    white space spectrum. The following sections discuss
	    various aspects of such an interface and the need for a
	    standard. Other aspects of a solution including
	    provisioning the database, and calculating protected
	    contours are considered out of scope of the initial
	    effort, as there are significant differences between
	    countries and spectrum bands. 
	  </t>

	  <section title="Global applicability">
	    <t>
	      The use of TV white space spectrum is currently approved
	      by the FCC in the United States. However 
	      regulatory bodies in other countries are also
	      considering similar use of available spectrum. The
	      principles of cognitive radio usage for such spectrum is
	      generally the same. Some of the regulatory details 
	      may vary on a country specific basis. However the need for
	      devices that intend to use the spectrum to communicate
	      with a database remains a common feature.  The database
	      provides a known, specifiable Protection Contour for the
	      primary user, not dependent on the characteristics of
	      the White Space Device or it's ability to sense the
	      primary use.  It also provides a way to specify a
	      schedule of use, because some primary users (for
	      example, wireless microphones) only operate in limited
	      time slots. 
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Devices need to be able to query a database, directly or
	      indirectly over the public Internet and/or private IP
	      networks prior to operating in 
	      available spectrum. Information about available
	      spectrum, schedule, power, etc. are provided by the
	      database as a response to the query from a device. 
	      The messaging interface needs to be:
	    </t>
	    <t>
	    <list style="numbers">
	      <t>Radio/air interface agnostic - The radio/air
	      interface technology used by the white space device in
	      available spectrum can be 802.11af, 802.16, 802.22, LTE
	      etc. However the messaging interface between the white
	      space device and the database should be agnostic to the
	      air interface while being cognizant of the
	      characteristics of various air-interface technologies
	      and the need to include relevant attributes in the query
	      to the database.
	      </t>
              <t>Spectrum agnostic - the spectrum used by primary and
              secondary users varies by country.  Some spectrum has an
              explicit notion of a "channel" a defined swath of
              spectrum within a band that has some assigned
              identifier.  Other spectrum bands may be subject to
              white space sharing, but only have actual frequency
              low/high parameters to define protected entity use.  The
              protocol should be able to be used in any spectrum band
              where white space sharing is permitted.</t> 
	      <t>Globally applicable - A common messaging interface
	      between white space devices and databases will enable
	      the use of such spectrum for various purposes on a
	      global basis. Devices can operate in any country where
	      such spectrum is available and a common interface
	      ensures uniformity in implementations and deployment.
	      Since the White Space device must know it's geospatial
	      location to do a query, it is possible to determine
	      which database, and which rules, are applicable, even
	      though they are country specific. 
	      </t>
	      <t>Address regulatory requirements - Each country will
	      likely have regulations that are unique to that
	      country. The messaging interface needs to be flexible to
	      accommodate the specific needs of a regulatory body in
	      the country where the white space device is operating
	      and connecting to the relevant database.
	      </t>
	    </list>
	    </t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Database discovery">
	    <t>
	      Another aspect of the problem space is the need to
	      discover the database. A white space device needs to
	      find the relevant database to query based on its current
	      location or for another location. Since the spectrum and
	      databases are country specific, the device will need to
	      discover the relevant database. The device needs to
	      obtain the IP address of the specific database to which
	      it can send queries in addition to registering itself
	      for operation and using the available spectrum.  
	    </t>
	  </section>

          <section title="Protocol">
            <t>A protocol that enables a white space device to query a database to obtain information about available channels is needed. A device may be required to register with the database with some credentials prior to being allowed to query. The requirements for such a protocol are specified in this document.
            </t> 
          </section>
	  <section title="Data model definition">
	    <t>
	      The contents of the queries and response need to be
	      specified. A data model is required which enables the
	      white space device to query the database while including
	      all the relevant information such as geolocation, radio
	      technology, power characteristics, etc. which may be country and spectrum and regulatory dependent. All databases
	      are able to interpret the data model and respond to the
	      queries using the same data model that is understood by
	      all devices. 
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Use of XML for specifying a data model is an attractive
	      option. The intent is to evaluate the best option that
	      meets the need for use between white space devices and databases.

    Wireless spectrum is a scarce resource. As the demand for spectrum

    efficient usage of spectrum via means such as sensing or by
    querying a database to determine available spectrum at a given
    location for secondary use. White space is the general term used to
    refer to the bands within the spectrum which is available for
    secondary use at a given location. In order to use this spectrum a
    device needs to query a database which maintains information about
    the available channels within a band. A protocol is necessary for
    communication between the devices and databases which would be
    globally applicable.
  </t>
    <t>The document describes some examples of the role of the white space database in the operation of a radio network and also shows an examples of a services provided to the user of a TVWS device. From these use cases requirements are determined. These requirements are to be used as input to the definition of a Protocol to Access White Space database (PAWS).
