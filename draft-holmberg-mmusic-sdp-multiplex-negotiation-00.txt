Internet-Draft                Multiplexing                September 2011


1.  Introduction

   In the IETF RTCWEB WG, a need for media multiplexing has been
   identified.  In order to be able to establish media sessions with
   entities that do not support multiplexing, there needs to be a
   mechanism to negotiate whether multiplexing will be used or not.

   This document defines a mechanism to negotiate the usage of
   multiplexing using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566],
   by indicating identical "m=" line port number values to every media
   stream that would be part of a multiplex.

   As defined in RFC 4566, the semantics of multiple "m=" lines using
   the same transport address are undefined, and there is no grouping
   defined by such means.  Instead, an explicit grouping mechanism needs
   to be used to express the intended semantics.  Therefore, this
   specification defines an SDP grouping framework [RFC5888] extension,
   MULTIPLEX, which is used to group media that is part of a multiplex.

   The mechanism is backward compatible.  Entities that do not support
   the MULTIPLEX grouping extension, or do not want to enable
   multiplexing within the session associated with the SDP offer, are
   expected to generate a "normal" SDP answer, are expected to generate
   a "normal" SDP answer, using different port numbers for each "m="
   line, to the SDP offer.  The offerer will still use a single port for
   each media, but as the answerer will use separate ports there will be
   no multiplexing of media between the endpoints.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability Statement

   The mechanism in this specification only applies to SDP, when used
   together with the SDP offer/answer media negotiation mechanism
   [RFC3264].


4.  SDP Grouping Framework MULTIPLEX Extension Semantics

   This section defines a new SDP Grouping Framework extension,
   MULTIPLEX.

Internet-Draft                Multiplexing                September 2011


   The MULTIPEX extension can be indicated using an SDP session-level
   "a=group" attribute.  Every "m=" line that is grouped together, using
   an SDP media-level "a=mid" attribute, is part of a specific
   multiplex.

   OPEN ISSUE: We need a reference to the specification defining the
   actual multiplexing mechanism.


5.  SDP Offer/Answer Procedures

5.1.  General

   This section defines the SDP offer/answer procedures for negotiating
   the usage of multiplexing.

5.2.  SDP Offerer Procedures

   When an SDP offerer wants to offer multiplexed media, it inserts the
   same port number value for each "m=" line that is part of the offered
   multiplex.  In addition, the SDP offerer inserts an SDP session-level
   "a=group" attribute, with a "MULTIPLEX" value, and assigns an SDP
   media-level "a=mid" attribute value for each "m=" line that is part
   of the offered multiplex.

   NOTE: If the SDP offerer wants to disable a specific stream within a
   multiplex, it will use a zero port number value for the "m=" line
   associated with the stream.

   If the associated SDP answer includes the session-level "a=group"
   attribute, with a "MULTIPLEX" value, and associated "m=" lines with
   identical port number values, the SDP offerer can enable media
   multiplexing between the entities.

   If the associated SDP does not include the session-level "a=group"
   attribute, with a "MULTIPLEX" value, the SDP offerer MUST NUT enable
   media multiplexing between the entities, even if two or more "m="
   lines in the SDP answer contain identical port number values.

   If the SDP answer indicates that multiplexing will not be enabled,
   the offerer will still receive multiple media on the single port that
   it included in the SDP offer, and it normally will be able to
   separate each individual media.  The default mechanism for doing this
   is by using a 5-tuple based mapping for each individual media.  If
   the offerer is aware of the SSRC values that the remote peer will use
   in the media it sends, and the values will be unique for each media,
   the offerer can also separate media based on the SSRC values.

Internet-Draft                Multiplexing                September 2011


   NOTE: Assuming symmetric media is used, the offerer can use the port
   information from the SDP answer in order to create the 5-tuple
   mapping for each media.

   If the offerer is not able to separate multiple media on a single
   port, it MUST send a new SDP offer, without using the "MULTIPLEX"
   grouping, where each media (m= line) is given a different port number
   value.

   NOTE: If the SDP offer is rejected, and the SDP offerer has reasons
   to believe that the rejection is due to the fact that the SDP offer
   contained identical "m=" line port number values, the SDP offerer
   might send a new SDP offer, without offered multiplex (and with
   separate port number values for each "m=" line).

5.3.  SDP Answer Procedures

   When an SDP answerer receives an SDP offer, offering multiplexing, if
   the SDP answerer accepts the offered multiplexing, it MUST include a
   session-level "a=group" attribute, with a "MULTIPLEX" value, in the
   SDP answer.  In addition, the SDP answerer assigns an SDP media-level
   "a=mid" attribute value for each "m=" line that is part of the
   multiplex.

   If the SDP answerer does not accept the offered multiplex, it MUST
   NOT include a session-evel "a=group" attribute, with a "MULTIPLEX"
   value, in the SDP answer.  In addition, it MUST assign separate port
   number values for each "m=" line in the SDP answer.

   NOTE: If the SDP answerer wants to disable a specific stream within a
   multiplex, it will use a zero port number value for the "m=" line
   associated with the stream.


6.  Usage With ICE

   When an entity that supports the Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) mechanism [RFC5245] sends an SDP offer, it MUST
   include ICE candidates for each "m=" line of the SDP offer, even if
   it offers multiplexing and the SDP "m=" line port value numbers are
   identical.  This is true also for subsequent SDP offers, when the
   usage of multiplexing has previously been negotiated.

   When an entity that supports ICE and multiplexing receives an SDP
   offer, offering multiplexing and ICE, if it accepts the multiplex,
   and ICE, it MUST include ICE candidates for each "m=" line of the SDP
   answer, even if the SDP "m=" line port value numbers are identical.

Internet-Draft                Multiplexing                September 2011


   The candidate information inserted in an SDP offer or answer MUST be
   identical for each "m=" line associated with a specific MULTIPLEX SDP
   group.

   Once the usage of multiplexing has been negotiated, ICE connectivity
   checks and keep-alives only needs to be performed for the whole
   multiplex, represented by a MULTIPLEX SDP group, instead of for
   individual m= lines associated with the multiplex.


7.  Security Considerations

   TBA


8.  Example

   The example below shows an SDP offer, where multiplexing is offered.
   The example also shows two SDP answer alternatives: one where
   multiplexing is accepted, and one where multiplexing is rejected (or,
   not even supported) by the SDP answerer.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the new SDP Grouping semantic
   extension called MULTIPLEX.


10.  Acknowledgements

   The usage of the SDP grouping mechanism is based on a similar
   alternative proposed by Harald Alvestrand.  The SDP examples are also
   modified versions from the ones in the Alvestrand proposal.
