Internet-Draft       IPv6 Multicast Address Scopes              May 2013


   RFC 4291 [RFC4291] defines values and semantics for the scope field
   in IPv6 multicast addresses.  The following table updates those
   definitions:

   0  reserved

   1  Interface-Local scope

   2  Link-Local scope

   3  Network-Specific scope, greater than Link-Local scope, defined
      automatically from the network topology

   4  Admin-Local scope

   5  Site-Local scope

   6  (unassigned)

   7  (unassigned)

   8  Organization-Local scope

   9  (unassigned)

   A  (unassigned)

   B  (unassigned)

   C  (unassigned)

   D  (unassigned)

   E  Global scope

   F  reserved

2.  Definition of Network-Specific scopes

   The definition of any Network-Specific scope for a particular network
   technology should be published in an RFC.  For example, such a scope
   definition would be appropriate for publication in an "IPv6-over-foo"
   RFC.

   Any RFCs that include the definition of a Network-Specific scope will
   be listed in the IANA "IPv6 Multicast Address Scopes" registry.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to establish a sub-registry titled "IPv6 Multicast
   Address Scopes" in the existing "Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)
   Multicast Address Allocations" registry.  The "IPv6 Multicast Address
   Scopes" is to be populated with the scope values given in section 1,
   with a note associated with scope 3 listing all RFCs that define
   Network-Specific scoping rules that use scope 3.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations beyond those in RFC 4291
   [RFC4291].

5.  Normative References

              Architecture", RFC 4291, February 2006.
