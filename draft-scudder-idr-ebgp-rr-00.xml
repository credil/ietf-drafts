      <t>
Although originally conceived of as a purely IBGP device, in some cases a
route reflector may function as an EBGP speaker in addition to its role
as envisioned in RFC 4456.  When it does so, just like any other EBGP
speaker it must advertise its routes to its IBGP peers.  This document
explains what behavior is required of a route reflector that also
functions as an EBGP speaker.  It also clarifies the use of the 
ORIGINATOR_ID and CLUSTER_LIST attributes in this environment.

      <t>
Although originally conceived of as a purely IBGP device, in some cases
a <xref target="RFC4271">BGP</xref> route reflector may function as an
EBGP speaker in addition to its role as envisioned in <xref
target="RFC4456"></xref>.  When it does so, just like any other EBGP
speaker it must advertise its routes to its IBGP peers.  This document

functions as an EBGP speaker.  It also clarifies the use of the

     </t>
     <t>
The cardinal observation is that the functions outlined in <xref target="RFC4456"></xref>
apply exclusively to "reflected" routes, that is, IBGP routes that are propagated to
IBGP peers.

    <section title="Terminology">
<t>
In addition to the terms defined in <xref target="RFC4271"></xref> Section 1.1 and in
<xref target="RFC4456"></xref>, this document makes use of the following:
</t>
<t><list style="empty">
<t>
ASBR: Autonomous System Border Router. See EBGP Speaker.
</t>
<t>
RR: Route Reflector.
</t>
<t>
Redundant Route Reflector (or Redundant RR): Another route reflector in
the same cluster as the route reflector under consideration, when both
route reflectors are configured with the same CLUSTER_ID.
</t>
<t>
EBGP Speaker: A BGP speaker that has one or more EBGP peerings, and
thereby learns one or more EBGP routes. (If no routes are learned it is
still an EBGP Speaker, but this is a case of "a tree falling in a forest
with no one to hear it.") Also known as an ASBR.
</t>
</list></t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Updates to RFC 4456" anchor="updates">

<t>
When deciding how a route reflector that is also an ASBR should
propagate EBGP routes into IBGP, the key observation is that <xref
target="RFC4456"></xref> deals only with "reflected" routes, i.e. IBGP
routes that are propagated into IBGP.  For EBGP-learned routes, the BGP
speaker is the only source of routes for its AS.  For this reason, the
restrictions and assumptions that apply to reflected routes do not apply
to EBGP-learned routes.  For the purposes of such routes, the BGP
speaker functions as a normal IBGP router.  For example, the <xref
target="RFC4456"></xref> stricture against modifying the NEXT_HOP,
AS_PATH, LOCAL_PREF, and MED attributes does not apply to EBGP-learned
routes that are propagated into IBGP.
</t>
<t>
Specific updates to <xref target="RFC4456"></xref> are:
</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
<t>
The speaker SHOULD NOT add a CLUSTER_LIST to EBGP-learned routes when
advertising them into IBGP. <!-- Exception: the speaker MAY add a
CLUSTER_LIST (containing its own CLUSTER_ID) when advertising
EBGP-learned routes to peers other than a redundant RR.  When
advertising EBGP-learned routes to a redundant RR, the CLUSTER_LIST MUST
NOT be added.-->
</t>
<!--<t>
The speaker MAY add its own BGP Identifier as the ORIGINATOR_ID in
EBGP-learned routes when advertising them into IBGP.
</t>-->
<t>
The attributes ORIGINATOR_ID and CLUSTER_LIST MUST NOT be sent to EBGP
peers.  If received from an EBGP peer, these attributes MUST be 
ignored and not propagated further; an error message MAY be logged.
</t>
</list></t>
   </section>
   
   <section title="Deployment Considerations">
<t>
If route reflectors are deployed in an Autonomous System such that no
two route reflectors have the same CLUSTER_ID, then there are no
"redundant route reflectors" (as the term is used herein) and thus,
the considerations regarding redundant RRs in <xref target="updates"></xref> 
as well as below are moot.
</t>
<t>
A RR that serves as an EBGP speaker SHOULD have an IBGP peering with any
redundant RR.  It SHOULD advertise the same EBGP-learned routes over
this peering that it advertises to any other IBGP peer.  It MAY suppress
reflection of any IBGP-learned routes to the redundant RR.  (Recall that
according to <xref target="RFC4456"></xref> Section 8, such routes would
be ignored by the redundant RR anyway due to a loop in the CLUSTER_LIST.)
The peering MAY be omitted if the route reflectors in question are
control plane-only devices not in the forwarding path of any traffic,
or if the network in question uses some form of tunneled or
label-switched forwarding.  The cost of omitting the peering is that
certain low-probability failure modes may cause unnecessary
unreachability -- specifically, if the EBGP-speaking RR were to lose its
session to one or more of its RR clients, reachability to the
EBGP-learned routes would be preserved if a session remained up to its
redundant RR peer.  (Similar considerations apply even to route
reflectors which do not have a collocated ASBR function, but such are
beyond the scope of this document.)
