2.  Update to RFC 6487

   [RFC6487] profiles certificates, certificate revocation lists, and
   certificate signing requests specified in [RFC5280] for use in
   routing public key infrastructure.

   [RFC5280] defines an extension to certificates for the listing of
   policy information (See section 4.2.1.4).  [RFC6487] states in
   Section 4.8.9: "This extension MUST be present and MUST be marked
   critical.  It MUST include exactly one policy, as specified in the
   RPKI CP [RFC6484]".  This references the CertPolicyId of the sequence
   allowed in PolicyInformation as defined by [RFC5280].

   [RFC5280] also specifies that PolicyInformation may optionally have a
   sequence of PolicyQualifierInfo objects.  [RFC6487] does not
   specifically allow or disallow these PolicyQualifierInfo objects
   although it also states in section 4: "Unless specifically noted as
   being OPTIONAL, all the fields listed here MUST be present, and any
   other fields MUST NOT appear in a conforming resource certificate."

   This document updates [RFC6487], Section 4.8.9, to explicitly allow
   optional PolicyQualifierInfo objects in the PolicyInformation
   specified by [RFC6487].

   As noted in [RFC5280], section 4.2.1.4: "Optional qualifiers, which
   MAY be present, are not expected to change the definition of the
   policy."  In this case any optional policy qualifiers that MAY be
   present in a resource certificate MUST NOT change the definition of
   the RPKI CP [RFC6484].

   Frank Hill and Adam Guyot helped define the scope of this issue and
   identified and worked with RPKI validator implementers to clarify the
   use of policy qualifiers in resource certificates.
