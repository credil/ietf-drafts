This document augments the procedures described in RFC 2661 to further
support ATM SVC (Switched Virtual Circuits) or PVC (Permanent Virtual
Circuits) based access networks.  L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)
specifies a protocol for tunnelling PPP packets over packet based
networks and over IP networks in particular.  L2TP supports remote
access by ISDN and PSTN networks.  The extensions defined within this
document allow for asymmetric bi-directional call establishment and
service selection in the ATM access network.  

This document is a product of the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol
Extensions Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
