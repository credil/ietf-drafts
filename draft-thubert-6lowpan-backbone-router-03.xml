	   In order to meet industrial requirements for non-critical monitoring, alerting,
	   supervisory control, open loop control and some closed loop control
	   applications, both  <xref target="ISA100.11a"/> and wireless <xref target="HART"/> standards
	   leverage advanced technology at every layer, including the Time Synchronized Channel Hopping (TSCH)
	   Medium Access Control (MAC) operation that enables deterministic behaviours for time-sensitive flows.
	   Additionally, <xref target="ISA100.11a"/> endorsed the 
	   6LoWPAN Header Compression <xref target="RFC6282"/> format for the
	   network header, making it possible to utilize IPv6 based protocols such
	   as BACnet IP, Profibus IP and Modbus TCP without significant changes
	   to those protocols.

	  </t>
	  <t>
	    <xref target="ISA100.11a"/> has introduced the concept of a Backbone Router
	    that would interconnect small LLNs over a high speed Backbone network and scale
	     a single ISA100.11a network up to the thousands of nodes. In that model
		 the LLNs and the backbone form a single subnet in which nodes can move freely
		 without the
		 need of renumbering, and the Backbone Router is a special kind of Border Router
		 designed to manage the interaction between the LLNs and the backbone at layer 3.
		 <!--How to implement the Backbone Router
	    will not be part of the initial release of the ISA100.11a standard.-->
		Similar scalability requirements exist in the metering and monitoring industries.
		In a network that large, it is impossible for a node to register to all Border Routers
		as suggested for smaller topologies in <xref target="RFC6775">
		Neighbor Discovery Optimization for Low-power and Lossy Networks</xref>.

	  	  <t>
	    This paper specifies IP layer functionalities that are required to implement
	    the concept of a Backbone Router with IPv6, in particular the application of the

	    the backbone network that was envisioned by ISA100.11a.

	   The way the nodes in the LLN learn about their Backbone Router depends on the protocol

	   <t>
	      The scope of this draft is a Backbone Link that federates multiple LLNs as a single IPv6 subnet.
		  Each LLN in the subnet is anchored at a Backbone Router (BBR). The Backbone Routers interconnect 
		  the LLNs over the Backbone Link and emulate that the LLN nodes are present on the Backbone
		  by proxy-ND operations. An LLN node can move freely from an LLN anchored at a Backbone Router
		  to an LLN anchored at another Backbone Router on the same backbone and conserve any of the IPv6 
		  addresses that it has formed. In a same fashion, an Efficiency-Aware Host (EAH) residing on the 
		  Backbone may change its BBR - acting as  IPv6 ND-efficiency-aware Router (NEAR) - and conserve its addresses
		  with no disruption.
           </t>
		   <t>
		   Energy-Constrained Nodes are often associated with radios and therefore may change their point of attachment in the network.
		Virtual devices - typically virtual machines in a datacenter - also move though in a different fashion, from a physical device to the next.
	In the case if a movement, it might be difficult for Stateful devices in the network such as the NEAR and SAVI switches to differentiate a duplication from a movement. 
	And if indeed it is a movement, then it might be difficult to select to freshest information to know where the device actually is.

	   <t>
	      The Backbone Link is used as reference for
	      Neighbor Discovery operations, by extending the concept of a Home Link
	      as defined in <xref target="RFC3775"/> for Mobile IPv6.
	      In particular, Backbone Routers perform ND proxying for the Energy-Constrained Nodes
	      in the LLNs they own through a node registration.
           </t>

	   <t>
	     The Backbone Router operation is compatible with that of a Home Agent.
	     This enables mobility support for LLN devices that would move
	     outside of the network delimited by the Backbone link. This also enables
	     collocation of Home Agent functionality within Backbone Router
	     functionality on the same interface of a router.
           </t>

		 <t> 
		 A Energy-Constrained Node registers and claims ownership of its addresse(s) using 
		 proactive acknowledged registration exchanges with a neighboring router.
		 In case of a complex LLN topology, the router might be an intermediate LLN
		 Router that relays the registration to the BBR (acting as LBR) as described in  
		 <xref target="RFC6775"/>.
		 In turn, the Backbone Routers operate as a distributed database of all the Energy-Constrained Nodes 
		 whether theyreside on the LLNs or the backbone, and use the Neighbor Discovery 
		 Protocol to share that information across the Backbone in the classical ND reactive fashion.
		</t>


	   <t>
	     For the purpose of Neighbor Discovery proxying, this specification documents
	     the LLN Master Neighbor Registry, a conceptual data structure that is similar to the
	     MIP6 binding cache. The Master Neighbor Registry is fed by redistributing addresses learnt
		 from the registration protocol used over the LLN.
           </t>

	   <t>
	     Another function of the Backbone Router is to perform 6LoWPAN  compression and
	     expansion between the LLN and the Backbone Link and ensure MTU compatibility.
	     Packets flow uncompressed over the Backbone Link and are routed normally towards
	     a Gateway or an Application sitting on the Backbone link or on a different
	     link that is reachable over the IP network.
           </t>


        </section>

	<section anchor='mess' title="New types and formats">
	
		<t>The specification expects that the protocol running on the LLN can provide
		a sequence number called Transaction ID (TID) that is associated to the registration. 
		When a node registers to multiple BBRs, it is expected that the same TID is used, 
		to enable the BBR to correlate the registrations as being a single one, and
		differentiate that situation from a movement. Otherwise, the resolution makes
		it so that only the most recent registration was perceived from the highest TID
		is kept.</t>
		
	    <t>The specification expects that the protocol running on the LLN can provide
		a unique ID for the owner of the address that is being registered. 
		The Owner Unique ID enables to differentiate
		a duplicate registration from a double registration. In case of a duplicate, the last
		registration looses. The Owner Unique ID can be as simple as a EUI-64 burnin address, if
		the device manufacturor is convinced that there can not be a manuf error that would 
		cause duplicate EUI64 addresses. Alternatively, the unique ID can be a hash of supposedly
		unique information from multiple orthogonal sources, for instance:
		<list  style="symbols">
		<t> Burn in address.
		</t>
		<t> configured address, id, security keys...
		</t>
		<t> (pseudo) Random number, radio link metrics ...
		</t>
		</list>
		In any fashion, it is recommended that the device stores the unique Id in persistent memory.
		Otherwise, it will be prevented to reregister after a reboot that would cause a loss of memory
		until the Backbone Router times out the registration.
		</t>
		<t>The unique ID and the sequence number are placed in a new ND option that is used by the
		Backbone Routers over the Backbone link to detect duplicates and movements. The option format 
		is as follows:
		</t>


	<section anchor='trackingmess' title="The Enhanced Address Registration Option (EARO)">

   <t> This option is designed to be used with standard NS and NA messages between backbone Routers
   over a backbone link and may be used between LRs and LBRs over the LLN.
   By using this option, the binding in question can be uniquely identified and matched with 
   the Master Neighbor Registry entries of each Backbone Router.</t>

	  <t>The Backbone Router is a specific kind of Border Router that performs

	  The draft introduces the concept of primary and secondary BBRs. The concept is
	  defined with the granularity of an address, that is a given 
	  BBR can be primary for a given address and secondary or another one, 
	  regardess on whether the addresses belong to the same node or not.
	  The primary Backbone Router is in charge of protecting the address for DAD over the
	  Backbone. Any of the Primary and Secondary BBR may claim the address over the 
	  backbone, since they are all capable to route from the backbone to the LLN device.</t>
	  
	  <t>When the protocol used to register the nodes over the LLN is 
	  <xref target="RFC6550">RPL</xref>, 
	  it is expected that one BBR acts as virtual root coordinating LLN
       BBRs (with the same DODAGID) over the non-LLN backbone. 
	   In that case, the virtual root may act as primary BBR for
       all addresses that it cares to support, whereas the physical 
	   roots to which the node is attached are secondary BBRs. 
	   It is also possible in a given deployment that 
	   the DODAGs are not coordinated. In that case, 
	   there is no virtual root and no secondary BBR; the DODAG 
	   root is primary all the nodes registered to it over the backbone.</t>
	   
	   <t>When the protocol used to register the nodes over the LLN is 
	   <xref target="RFC6775"> 6LoWPAN ND</xref>, 
	   the Backbone Routers act as a distributed DAD table, using 
	   classical ND over the backbone to detect duplication. This specification
	   requires that:
      <list style="numbers">
	  <t>Registrations for all addresses that can be required to reach the device over the backbone,
	  including registrations for IPv6 addresses based on burn-in EUI64 addresses
	  are passed to the DAD table. </t>
	   <t> Nodes include the EARO in their NS used for registering those addresses
	   and the LRs propagate that option to the LBRs.
	   </t>
	   </list>
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   A false positive duplicate detection may arise over the backbone, 
	   for instance if the node registers to more than one LBR, 
       or if the node has moved. Both situations are handled gracefully 
	   unbeknownst to the node. In the former case, 
	   one LBR becomes primary to defend the address over the 
	   backbone while the others become secondary and may
	   still forward packets back and forth. In the latter case the LBR that receives
	   the newest registration wins and becomes primary.</t>

	  <!-- t>A Backbone Router advertises itself using a new option in the ND Router Advertisement
	  Message. A new anycast address 6LoWPAN_BBR is also introduced for the purpose of reaching the nearest 
	  Backbone Router in the absence of any information. This enables to reduce the use of multicast
	  RAs for the router discovery operation. The routing to the nearest router that owns that anycast 
	  address is out of scope for this specifiation.
	  </t -->
	  <!-- t> Another anycast address 6LoWPAN-NODE is introduced
	  to enable any Energy-Constrained Node to receive a response to its registration whether it completes
	  successfully or not.

	<t> If the TID in the ND message is the same as the most recent one known by the

           <t>
	   This specification expects that the link layer is sufficiently protected, either
	   by means of physical or IP security for the Backbone Link or MAC sublayer cryptography.
	   In particular, it is expected that the LLN MAC provides secure unicast
	   to/from the Backbone Router and secure BBRoadcast from the Backbone Router in a way that prevents
	   tempering with or replaying the RA messages.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   The use of EUI-64 for forming the Interface ID in the link local address prevents the usage
	   of Secure ND (<xref target="RFC3971"/> and <xref target="RFC3972"/>) and address privacy
	   techniques. Considering the envisioned deployments and the MAC layer security applied,
	   this is not considered an issue at this time.
