   isolating and reporting failures and for monitoring the network
   performance.

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


   There are several different interpretations to the "OAM" acronym.
   This document refers to Operations, Administration and Maintenance,
   as recommended in Section 3 of [RFC6291].

   This document summarizes some of the data plane OAM tools defined in
   the IETF in the context of IP unicast, MPLS, pseudowires, MPLS for
   the transport profile (MPLS-TP), and TRILL.

   This document focuses on data plane OAM tools. Hence, control and
   management aspects of OAM are outside the scope of this document.
   This document focuses on tools for detecting and isolating failures
   and for performance monitoring. Network repair functions such as Fast
   Reroute (FRR) and protection switching, which are often triggered by
   OAM protocols, are out of the scope of this document.

1.1. Background

   OAM was originally used in traditional communication technologies
   such as E1 and T1, evolving into PDH and then later in SONET/SDH. ATM
   was probably the first technology to include inherent OAM support
   from day one, while in other technologies OAM was typically defined
   in an ad hoc manner after the technology was already defined and
   deployed. Packet-based networks were traditionally considered
   unreliable and best-effort, but as packet-based networks evolved,
   they have become the common transport for both data and telephony,
   replacing traditional transport protocols. Consequently, packet-based
   networks were expected to provide a similar "carrier grade"
   experience, and specifically to support OAM.

   As typical networks have a multi-layer architecture, the set of OAM
   protocols similarly take a multi-layer structure; each layer has its
   own OAM protocols. Moreover, OAM can be used at different levels of
   hierarchy in the network to form a multi-layer OAM solution, as shown
   in the example in Figure 1.

   Figure 1 illustrates a network in which IP traffic between two
   customer edges is transported over an MPLS provider network. MPLS OAM
   is used at the provider-level for monitoring the connection between
   the two provider edges, while IP OAM is used at the customer-level
   for monitoring the end-to-end connection between the two customer
   edges.

1.2. Target Audience

   The target audience of this document includes:

   o Standard development organizations - both IETF working groups and
      non-IETF organizations can benefit from this document when
      designing new OAM protocols, or when looking to reuse existing OAM
      tools for new technologies.

   o Network equipment vendors and network operators - can use this
      document as an index to some of the common IETF OAM tools.

   It should be noted that this document is not necessarily suitable for
   beginners without any background in OAM.

1.3. OAM-related Work in the IETF

   This memo provides an overview of the different sets of OAM tools
   defined by the IETF. The set of OAM tools described in this memo are
   applicable to IP unicast, MPLS, pseudowires, MPLS for the transport
   profile (MPLS-TP), and TRILL. While OAM tools that are applicable to
   other technologies exist, they are beyond the scope of this memo.

   This document focuses on IETF documents that have been published as
   RFCs, while other ongoing OAM-related work is outside the scope.

   The IETF has defined OAM protocols and tools in several different
   contexts. We roughly categorize these efforts into a few sets of OAM-
   related RFCs, listed in Table 1. Each category defines a logically-

1.4. Focusing on Data Plane OAM Tools

   OAM tools may, and quite often do, work in conjunction with a control
   plane and/or management plane.  At the data plane, OAM provides
   instrumentation tools. OAM tools often use control plane functions,
   e.g., to initialize OAM sessions and to exchange various parameters.
   The OAM tools communicate with the management plane to raise alarms,
   and often OAM tools may be activated by the management (as well as by
   the control plane), e.g. to locate and localize problems.

   The considerations of the control plane maintenance tools and the
   functionality of the management plane are out of scope for this
   document, which concentrates on presenting the data plane tools that
   are used for OAM. Network repair functions such as Fast Reroute (FRR)

   and protection switching, which are often triggered by OAM protocols,
   are also out of the scope of this document.

   Since OAM protocols are used for monitoring the data plane, it is
   imperative for OAM tools to be capable of testing the actual data
   plane in as much accuracy as possible. Thus, it is important to
   enforce fate-sharing between OAM traffic that monitors the data plane
   and the data plane traffic it monitors.

2.2. Terminology used in OAM Standards

2.2.1. General Terms

   A wide variety of terms is used in various OAM standards. This
   section presents a comparison of the terms used in various OAM
   standards, without fully quoting the definition of each term.

   An interesting overview of the term OAM and its derivatives is
   presented in [OAM-Def]. A thesaurus of terminology for MPLS-TP terms
   is presented in [TP-Term], and provides a good summary of some of the
   OAM related terminology.

2.2.2. Operations, Administration and Maintenance

   The following definition of OAM is quoted from [OAM-Def]:

   The components of the "OAM" acronym (and provisioning) are defined as
   follows:

   o Operations - Operation activities are undertaken to keep the
      network (and the services that the network provides) up and
      running.  It includes monitoring the network and finding problems.
      Ideally these problems should be found before users are affected.

   o Administration - Administration activities involve keeping track
      of resources in the network and how they are used.  It includes
      all the bookkeeping that is necessary to track networking
      resources and the network under control.

   o Maintenance - Maintenance activities are focused on facilitating
      repairs and upgrades -- for example, when equipment must be
      replaced, when a router needs a patch for an operating system
      image, or when a new switch is added to a network.  Maintenance
      also involves corrective and preventive measures to make the
      managed network run more effectively, e.g., adjusting device
      configuration and parameters.

2.2.3. Functions, Tools and Protocols

OAM Function



   An OAM function is an instrumentation measurement type or diagnostic.




Mizrahi, et al.        Expires April 21, 2014                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


   OAM functions are the atomic building blocks of OAM, where each
   function defines an OAM capability.

   Typical examples of OAM functions are presented in Section 3.

OAM Protocol

   A protocol used for implementing one or more OAM functions.

   The OWAMP-Test [OWAMP] is an example of an OAM protocol.

OAM Tool

   An OAM tool is a specific means of applying one or more OAM
   functions.

   In some cases an OAM protocol *is* an OAM tool, e.g., OWAMP-Test. In
   other cases an OAM tool uses a set of protocols that are not strictly
   OAM-related; for example, Traceroute (Section 4.2.) can be
   implemented using UDP and ICMP messages, without using an OAM
   protocol per se.

2.2.4. Data Plane, Control Plane and Management Plane

Data Plane

   The data plane is the set of functions used to transfer data in the
   stratum or layer under consideration [ITU-Terms].

   .

   The Data Plane is also known as the Forwarding Plane or the User
   Plane.

Control Plane

   The control plane is the set of protocols and mechanisms that enable
   routers to efficiently learn how to forward packets towards their
   final destination (based on [Comp]).

Management Plane

   The term Management Plane, as described in [Mng], is used to describe
   the exchange of management messages through management protocols
   (often transported by IP and by IP transport protocols) between
   management applications and the managed entities such as network

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


Data Plane vs. Control Plane vs. Management Plane

   The distinction between the planes is at times a bit vague. For
   example, the definition of "Control Plane" above may imply that OAM
   tools such as ping, BFD and others are in fact in the control plane.

   This document focuses on data plane OAM tools, i.e., tools used for
   monitoring the data plane. While these tools could arguably be
   considered to be in the control plane, these tools monitor the data
   plane, and hence it is imperative to have fate-sharing between OAM
   traffic that monitors the data plane and the data plane traffic it
   monitors.

   Another potentially vague distinction is between the management plane
   and control plane. The management plane should be seen as separate
   from, but possibly overlapping with, the control plane (based on
   [Mng]).

2.2.5. The Players

   An OAM tool is used between two (or more) "players". Various terms
   are used in IETF documents to refer to the players that take part in
   OAM. Table 2 summarizes the terms used in each of the categories
   discussed in this document.

                   Table 2 Maintenance Point Terminology



2.2.6. Proactive and On-demand Activation

   The different OAM tools may be used in one of two basic types of
   activation:

Proactive

   Proactive activation - indicates that the tool is activated on a
   continual basis, where messages are sent periodically, and errors are
   detected when a certain number of expected messages are not received.

On-demand

   On-demand activation - indicates that the tool is activated
   "manually" to detect a specific anomaly.

2.2.7. Connectivity Verification and Continuity Checks

   Two distinct classes of failure management functions are used in OAM
   protocols, connectivity verification and continuity checks. The
   distinction between these terms is defined in [MPLS-TP-OAM], and is
   used similarly in this document.

Continuity Check

   Continuity checks are used to verify that a destination is reachable,
   and are typically sent proactively, though they can be invoked on-
   demand as well.

Connectivity Verification

   A connectivity verification function allows Alice to check whether
   she is connected to Bob or not. This function also allows Alice to
   verify that messages from Bob are received through the correct path,
   thereby verifying not only that the two MPs are connected, but also
   that they are connected through the expected path, allowing detection
   of unexpected topology changes. It is noted that while the CV
   function is performed in the data plane, the "expected path" is

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


   predetermined either in the control plane or in the management plane.
   A connectivity verification (CV) protocol typically uses a CV
   message, followed by a CV reply that is sent back to the originator.
   A CV function can be applied proactively or on-demand.

   Connectivity verification and continuity checks are considered
   complementary mechanisms, and are often used in conjunction with each
   other.

2.2.8. Connection Oriented vs. Connectionless Communication

Connection Oriented

   In Connection Oriented technologies an end-to-end connection is
   established (by a control protocol or provisioned by a management
   system) prior to the transmission of data.

   Typically a connection identifier is used to identify the connection.
   In connection oriented technologies it is often the case (although
   not always) that all packets belonging to a specific connection use
   the same route through the network.

Connectionless

   In Connectionless technologies data is typically sent between end
   points without prior arrangement. Packets are routed independently
   based on their destination address, and hence different packets may
   be routed in a different way across the network.

Discussion

   The OAM tools described in this document include tools that support
   connection oriented technologies, as well as tools for connectionless
   technologies.

   In connection oriented technologies OAM is used to monitor a
   *specific* connection; OAM packets are forwarded through the same
   route as the data traffic and receive the same treatment. In
   connectionless technologies, OAM is used between a source and
   destination pair without defining a specific connection. Moreover, in
   some cases the route of OAM packets may differ from the one of the
   data traffic. For example, the connectionless IP Ping (Section 4.1.)
   tests the reachability from a source to a given destination, while
   the connection oriented LSP Ping (Section 4.4.) is used for
   monitoring a specific LSP (connection), and provides the capability
   to monitor all the available paths used by an LSP.

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


   It should be noted that in some cases connectionless protocols are
   monitored by connection oriented OAM protocols. For example, while IP
   is a connectionless protocol, it can monitored by BFD (Section 4.3.
   ), which is connection oriented.

2.2.9. Point-to-point vs. Point-to-multipoint Services

Point-to-point (P2P)

   A P2P service delivers data from a single source to a single
   destination.

Point-to-multipoint (P2MP)

   An P2MP service delivers data from a single source to a one or more
   destinations (based on [Signal]).

   [Signal] also defines a MP2MP service as a service that delivers data
   from more than one source to one or more receivers.

Discussion

   The OAM tools described in this document include tools for P2P
   services, as well as tools for P2MP services.

   The distinction between P2P services and P2MP services affects the
   corresponding OAM tools. A P2P service is typically simpler to
   monitor, as it consists of a single pair of end points. P2MP services
   present several challenges. For example, in a P2MP service, the OAM
   mechanism not only verifies that each of the destinations is
   reachable from the source, but also verifies that the P2MP
   distribution tree is intact and loop-free. Another challenge in P2MP
   services is performance monitoring; while in P2P packet loss is
   measured by maintaining packet counters at the two end-points, in
   P2MP packet loss must be carefully measured by generating synthetic
   traffic to each corresponding end-point and maintaining a separate
   counter for each peer end-point.

2.2.10. Failures

   The terms Failure, Fault, and Defect are used interchangeably in the
   standards, referring to a malfunction that can be detected by a
   connectivity or a continuity check. In some standards, such as
   802.1ag [IEEE802.1Q] , there is no distinction between these terms,
   while in other standards each of these terms refers to a different
   type of malfunction.

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


   The terminology used in IETF MPLS-TP OAM is based on the ITU-T
   terminology, which distinguishes between these three terms in
   [ITU-T-G.806];

Fault

   The term Fault refers to an inability to perform a required action,
   e.g., an unsuccessful attempt to deliver a packet.

Defect

   The term Defect refers to an interruption in the normal operation,
   such as a consecutive period of time where no packets are delivered
   successfully.

Failure

   The term Failure refers to the termination of the required function.
   While a Defect typically refers to a limited period of time, a
   failure refers to a long period of time.

3. OAM Functions

   This subsection provides a brief summary of the common OAM functions
   used in OAM-related standards. These functions are used as building
   blocks in the OAM standards described in this document.

   o Connectivity Verification (CV) and/or Continuity Checks (CC):
      As defined in Section 2.2.7.

   o Path Discovery / Fault Localization:
      This function can be used to trace the route to a destination,
      i.e., to identify the nodes along the route to the destination.
      When more than one route is available to a specific destination,
      this function traces one of the available routes. When a failure
      occurs, this function also allows to detect the location of the
      failure.
      Note that the term route tracing (or Traceroute) that is used in
      the context of IP and MPLS, is sometimes referred to as path
      tracing in the context of other protocols, such as TRILL.

   o Performance Monitoring:
      Typically refers to:

        o Loss Measurement (LM) - monitors the packet loss rate.

          variation.

4. OAM Tools in the IETF - a Detailed Description

   This section presents a detailed description of the sets of OAM-
   related tools in each of the categories in Table 1.

4.1. IP Ping

   Ping is a common network diagnosis application for IP networks that
   uses ICMP. According to [NetTerms], 'Ping' is an abbreviation for
   Packet internet groper, although the term has been so commonly used
   that it stands on its own.  As defined in [NetTerms], it is a program
   used to test reachability of destinations by sending them an ICMP
   echo request and waiting for a reply.

   The ICMP Echo request/reply exchange in Ping is used as a continuity
   check function for the Internet Protocol. The originator transmits an
   ICMP Echo request packet, and the receiver replies with an Echo
   reply. ICMP ping is defined in two variants, [ICMPv4] is used for
   IPv4, and [ICMPv6] is used for IPv6.

   Ping implementations typically use ICMP messages. UDP Ping is a
   variant that uses UDP messages instead of ICMP echo messages.

   Ping is a single-ended continuity check, i.e., it allows the
   *initiator* of the Echo request to test the reachability. If it is
   desirable for both ends to test the reachability, both ends have to
   invoke Ping independently.

   Note that since ICMP filtering is deployed in some routers and
   firewalls, the usefulness of Ping is sometimes limited in the wider
   internet. This limitation is equally relevant to Traceroute.

4.2. IP Traceroute

   Traceroute ([TCPIP-Tools], [NetTools]) is an application that allows
   users to discover a path between an IP source and an IP destination.

   The most common way to implement Traceroute [TCPIP-Tools] is
   described as follows. Traceroute sends a sequence of UDP packets to
   UDP port 33434 at the destination. By default, Traceroute begins by
   sending three packets (the number of packets is configurable in most
   Traceroute implementations), each with an IP Time-To-Live (or Hop
   Limit in IPv6) value of one to the destination. These packets expire
   as soon as they reach the first router in the path. Consequently,


Mizrahi, et al.        Expires April 21, 2014                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


   that router sends three ICMP Time Exceeded Messages back to the
   Traceroute application. Traceroute now sends another three UDP
   packets, each with the TTL value of 2. These messages cause the
   second router to return ICMP messages. This process continues, with
   ever increasing values for the TTL field, until the packets actually
   reach the destination. Because no application listens to port 33434
   at the destination, the destination returns ICMP Destination
   Unreachable Messages indicating an unreachable port. This event
   indicates to the Traceroute application that it is finished.  The
   Traceroute program displays the round-trip delay associated with each
   of the attempts.

   While Traceroute is a tool that finds *a* path from A to B, it should
   be noted that traffic from A to B is often forwarded through Equal
   Cost Multiple Paths (ECMP). Paris Traceroute [Paris] is an extension
   to Traceroute that attempts to discovers all the available paths from
   A to B by scanning different values of header fields (such as UDP
   ports) in the probe packets.

   It is noted that Traceroute is an application, and not a protocol. As
   such, it has various different implementations. One of the most
   common ones uses UDP probe packets, as described above. Other
   implementations exist that use other types of probe messages, such as
   ICMP or TCP.

   Note that IP routing may be asymmetric. While Traceroute discovers a
   path between a source and destination, it does not reveal the reverse
   path.

   A few ICMP extensions ([ICMP-MP], [ICMP-Int]) have been defined in
   the context of Traceroute. These documents define several extensions,
   including extensions to the ICMP Destination Unreachable message,
   that can be used by Traceroute applications.

4.3. Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)

4.3.1. Overview

   While multiple OAM tools have been defined for various protocols in
   the protocol stack, Bidirectional Forwarding Detection [BFD], defined
   by the IETF BFD working group, is a generic OAM tool that can be
   deployed over various encapsulating protocols, and in various medium
   types. The IETF has defined variants of the protocol for IP ([BFD-
   IP], [BFD-Multi]), for MPLS LSPs [BFD-LSP], and for pseudowires [BFD-
   VCCV]. The usage of BFD in MPLS-TP is defined in [TP-CC-CV].

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


   BFD includes two main OAM functions, using two types of BFD packets:
   BFD Control packets, and BFD Echo packets.

4.3.2. Terminology

   BFD operates between two *systems*. The BFD protocol is run between
   two systems after establishing a *session*.

4.3.3. BFD Control

   BFD supports a bidirectional continuity check, using BFD control
   packets, that are exchanged within a BFD session. BFD sessions
   operate in one of two modes:

   o Asynchronous mode (i.e. proactive): in this mode BFD control
      packets are sent periodically. When the receiver detects that no
      BFD control packets have been received during a predetermined
      period of time, a failure is detected.

   o Demand mode: in this mode, BFD control packets are sent on-demand.
      Upon need, a system initiates a series of BFD control packets to
      check the continuity of the session. BFD control packets are sent
      independently in each direction.

   Each of the end-points (referred to as systems) of the monitored path
   maintains its own session identification, called a Discriminator,
   both of which are included in the BFD Control Packets that are
   exchanged between the end-points.  At the time of session
   establishment, the Discriminators are exchanged between the two-end
   points.  In addition, the transmission (and reception) rate is
   negotiated between the two end-points, based on information included
   in the control packets.  These transmission rates may be renegotiated
   during the session.

   During normal operation of the session, i.e. no failures are
   detected, the BFD session is in the Up state.  If no BFD Control
   packets are received during a period of time called the Detection
   Time, the session is declared to be Down. The detection time is a
   function of the pre-configured or negotiated transmission time, and a
   parameter called Detect Mult. Detect Mult determines the number of
   missing BFD Control packets that cause the session to be declared as
   Down. This parameter is included in the BFD Control packet.

4.3.4. BFD Echo

   A BFD echo packet is sent to a peer system, and is looped back to the
   originator. The echo function can be used proactively, or on-demand.


Mizrahi, et al.        Expires April 21, 2014                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


   The BFD echo function has been defined in BFD for IPv4 and IPv6
   ([BFD-IP]), but is not used in BFD for MPLS LSPs, PWs, or in BFD for
   MPLS-TP.

4.4. MPLS OAM

   The IETF MPLS working group has defined OAM for MPLS LSPs. The
   requirements and framework of this effort are defined in
   [MPLS-OAM-FW] and [MPLS-OAM], respectively. The corresponding OAM
   tool defined, in this context, is LSP Ping [LSP-Ping]. OAM for P2MP
   services is defined in [MPLS-P2MP].

   LSP Ping is modeled after the Ping/Traceroute paradigm and thus it
   may be used in one of two modes:

   o "Ping" mode: In this mode LSP Ping is used for end-to-end
      connectivity verification between two LERs.

   o "Traceroute" mode: This mode is used for hop-by-hop fault
      isolation.

   LSP Ping extends the basic ICMP Ping operation (of data-plane
   connectivity verification) with functionality to verify data-plane
   vs. control-plane consistency for a Forwarding Equivalence Class
   (FEC) and also Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) problems.

   The challenge in MPLS networks is that the traffic of a given LSP may
   be load balanced across Equal Cost Multiple paths (ECMP). LSP Ping
   monitors all the available paths of an LSP by monitoring its
   different Forwarding Equivalence Classes (FEC). Conversely, MPLS-TP
   does not use ECMP, and thus does not require OAM over multiple paths.
   The Traceroute functionality may be used to isolate and localize the
   MPLS faults, using the Time-to-live (TTL) indicator to incrementally
   identify the sub-path of the LSP that is successfully traversed
   before the faulty link or node.

   It should be noted that LSP Ping supports unique identification of
   the LSP within an addressing domain. The identification is checked
   using the full FEC identification. LSP Ping is easily extensible to
   include additional information needed to support new functionality,
   by use of Type-Length-Value (TLV) constructs. The usage of TLVs is
   typically not easy to perform in hardware, and is thus typically
   handled by the control plane.

   LSP Ping supports both asynchronous, as well as, on-demand
   activation.

4.5. MPLS-TP OAM

4.5.1. Overview

   The MPLS working group has defined the OAM toolset that fulfills the
   requirements for MPLS-TP OAM. The full set of requirements for MPLS-
   TP OAM are defined in [MPLS-TP-OAM], and include both general
   requirements for the behavior of the OAM tools and a set of
   operations that should be supported by the OAM toolset.  The set of
   mechanisms required are further elaborated in [TP-OAM-FW], which
   describes the general architecture of the OAM system as well as
   giving overviews of the functionality of the OAM toolset.

   Some of the basic requirements for the OAM toolset for MPLS-TP are:

   o MPLS-TP OAM must be able to support both an IP based and non-IP
      based environment. If the network is IP based, i.e. IP routing and
      forwarding are available, then the MPLS-TP OAM toolset should rely
      on the IP routing and forwarding capabilities. On the other hand,
      in environments where IP functionality is not available, the OAM
      tools must still be able to operate without dependence on IP
      forwarding and routing.

   o OAM packets and the user traffic are required to be congruent
      (i.e. OAM packets are transmitted in-band) and there is a need to
      differentiate OAM packets from data plane ones. Inherent in this
      requirement is the principle that MPLS-TP OAM be independent of
      any existing control-plane, although it should not preclude use of
      the control-plane functionality.

4.5.2. Terminology

Maintenance Entity (ME)

   The MPLS-TP OAM tools are designed to monitor and manage a
   Maintenance Entity (ME).  An ME, as defined in [TP-OAM-FW], defines a
   relationship between two points of a transport path to which
   maintenance and monitoring operations apply.

   The term Maintenance Entity (ME) is used in ITU-T Recommendations
   (e.g. [ITU-T-Y1731]), as well as in the MPLS-TP terminology
   ([TP-OAM-FW]).

Maintenance Entity Group (MEG)

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


   The collection of one or more MEs that belongs to the same transport
   path and that are maintained and monitored as a group are known as a
   Maintenance Entity Group (based on [TP-OAM-FW]).

Maintenance Point (MP)

   A Maintenance Point (MP) is a functional entity that is defined at a
   node in the network, and can initiate and/or react to OAM messages.
   This document focuses on the data-plane functionality of MPs, while
   MPs interact with the control plane and with the management plane as
   well.

   The term MP is used in IEEE 802.1ag, and was similarly adopted in
   MPLS-TP ([TP-OAM-FW]).

Maintenance End Point (MEP)

   A Maintenance End Point (MEP) is one of the end points of an ME, and
   can initiate OAM messages and respond to them (based on [TP-OAM-FW]).

Maintenance Intermediate Point (MIP)

   In between MEPs, there are zero or more intermediate points, called
   Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Points  (based on [TP-OAM-FW]).

   A Maintenance Intermediate Point (MIP) is an intermediate point that
   does not generally initiate OAM frames (one exception to this is the
   use of AIS notifications), but is able to respond to OAM frames that
   are destined to it. A MIP in MPLS-TP identifies OAM packets destined
   to it by the value of the TTL field in the OAM packet. The term
   Maintenance Point is a general term for MEPs and MIPs.

Up and Down MEPs

   The IEEE 802.1ag [IEEE802.1Q] defines a distinction between Up MEPs
   and Down MEPs. A MEP is a bridge interface that is monitored by an
   OAM protocol either in the direction facing the network, or in the
   direction facing the bridge. A Down MEP is a MEP that receives OAM
   packets from, and transmits them to the direction of the network. An
   Up MEP receives OAM packets from, and transmits them to the direction
   of the bridging entity. MPLS-TP ([TP-OAM-FW]) uses a similar
   distinction on the placement of the MEP - either at the ingress,
   egress, or forwarding function of the node (Down / Up MEPs).  This
   placement is important for localization of a failure.

   The distinction between Up and Down MEPs was defined in [TP-OAM-FW],
   but has not been used in other MPLS-TP RFCs, as of the writing of
   this document.

4.5.3. Generic Associated Channel

   In order to address the requirement for in-band transmission of MPLS-
   TP OAM traffic, MPLS-TP uses a Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh),
   defined in [G-ACh] for LSP-based OAM traffic. This mechanism is based
   on the same concepts as the PWE3 ACH and VCCV mechanisms.  However,
   to address the needs of LSPs as differentiated from PW, the following
   concepts were defined for [G-ACh]:

   o An Associated Channel Header (ACH), that uses a format similar to
      the PW Control Word, is a 4-byte header that is prepended to OAM
      packets.

   o A Generic Associated Label (GAL). The GAL is a reserved MPLS label
      value (13) that indicates that the packet is an ACH packet and the
      payload follows immediately after the label stack.

   It should be noted that while the G-ACh was defined as part of the
   MPLS-TP definition effort, the G-ACh is a generic tool that can be
   used in MPLS in general, and not only in MPLS-TP.

4.5.4. MPLS-TP OAM Toolset

   To address the functionality that is required of the OAM toolset, the
   MPLS WG conducted an analysis of the existing IETF and ITU-T OAM
   tools and their ability to fulfill the required functionality.  The
   conclusions of this analysis are documented in [OAM-Analys]. The MPLS
   working group currently plans to use a mixture of OAM tools that are
   based on various existing standards, and adapt them to the
   requirements of [MPLS-TP-OAM]. Some of the main building blocks of
   this solution are based on:

   o Bidirectional Forwarding Detection ([BFD], [BFD-LSP]) for
      proactive continuity check and connectivity verification.

   o LSP Ping as defined in [LSP-Ping] for on-demand connectivity
      verification.

   o New protocol packets, using G-ACH, to address different
      functionality.

   o Performance measurement protocols that are based on the
      functionality that is described in [ITU-T-Y1731].

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


   The following sub-sections describe the OAM tools defined for MPLS-TP
   as described in [TP-OAM-FW].

4.5.4.1. Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification

   Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification are presented in
   Section 2.2.7. of this document.  As presented there, these tools may
   be used either proactively or on-demand.  When using these tools
   proactively, they are generally used in tandem.

   For MPLS-TP there are two distinct tools, the proactive tool is
   defined in [TP-CC-CV] while the on-demand tool is defined in
   [OnDemand-CV]. In on-demand mode, this function should support
   monitoring between the MEPs and, in addition, between a MEP and MIP.
   [TP-OAM-FW] highlights,  when performing Connectivity Verification,
   the need for the CC-V messages to include unique identification of
   the MEG that is being monitored and the MEP that originated the
   message.

   The proactive tool [TP-CC-CV] is based on extensions to BFD (see
   Section 4.3.) with the additional limitation that the transmission
   and receiving rates are based on configuration by the operator.  The
   on-demand tool [OnDemand-CV] is an adaptation of LSP Ping (see
   Section 4.4.) for the required behavior of MPLS-TP.

4.5.4.2. Route Tracing

   [MPLS-TP-OAM] defines that there is a need for functionality that
   would allow a path end-point to identify the intermediate and end-
   points of the path. This function would be used in on-demand mode.
   Normally, this path will be used for bidirectional PW, LSP, and
   sections, however, unidirectional paths may be supported only if a
   return path exists.  The tool for this is based on the LSP Ping (see
   Section 4.4.) functionality and is described in [OnDemand-CV].

4.5.4.3. Lock Instruct

   The Lock Instruct function [Lock-Loop] is used to notify a transport
   path end-point of an administrative need to disable the transport
   path.  This functionality will generally be used in conjunction with
   some intrusive OAM function, e.g. Performance measurement, Diagnostic
   testing, to minimize the side-effect on user data traffic.

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


4.5.4.4. Lock Reporting

   Lock Reporting is a function used by an end-point of a path to report
   to its far-end end-point that a lock condition has been affected on
   the path.

4.5.4.5. Alarm Reporting

   Alarm Reporting [TP-Fault] provides the means to suppress alarms
   following detection of defect conditions at the server sub-layer.
   Alarm reporting is used by an intermediate point of a path, that
   becomes aware of a fault on the path, to report to the end-points of
   the path. [TP-OAM-FW] states that this may occur as a result of a
   defect condition discovered at a server sub-layer. This generates an
   Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) that continues until the fault is
   cleared. The consequent action of this function is detailed in
   [TP-OAM-FW].

4.5.4.6. Remote Defect Indication

   Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is used proactively by a path end-
   point to report to its peer end-point that a defect is detected on a
   bidirectional connection between them. [MPLS-TP-OAM] points out that
   this function may be applied to a unidirectional LSP only if there a
   return path exists.  [TP-OAM-FW] points out that this function is
   associated with the proactive CC-V function.

4.5.4.7. Client Failure Indication

   Client Failure Indication (CFI) is defined in [MPLS-TP-OAM] to allow
   the propagation information from one edge of the network to the
   other. The information concerns a defect to a client, in the case
   that the client does not support alarm notification.

4.5.4.8. Performance Monitoring

   The definition of MPLS performance monitoring was motivated by the
   MPLS-TP requirements [MPLS-TP-OAM], but was defined generically for
   MPLS in [MPLS-LM-DM]. An additional document [TP-LM-DM] defines a
   performance monitoring profile for MPLS-TP.

4.5.4.8.1. Packet Loss Measurement (LM)

   Packet Loss Measurement is a function used to verify the quality of
   the service. Packet loss, as defined in [IPPM-1LM] and [MPLS-TP-OAM],
   indicates the ratio of the number of user packets lost to the total
   number of user packets sent during a defined time interval.


Mizrahi, et al.        Expires April 21, 2014                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


   There are two possible ways of determining this measurement:

   o Using OAM packets, it is possible to compute the statistics based
      on a series of OAM packets. This, however, has the disadvantage of
      being artificial, and may not be representative since part of the
      packet loss may be dependent upon packet sizes and upon the
      implementation of the MEPs that take part in the protocol.

   o Sending delimiting messages for the start and end of a measurement
      period during which the source and sink of the path count the
      packets transmitted and received. After the end delimiter, the
      ratio would be calculated by the path OAM entity.

4.5.4.8.2. Packet Delay Measurement (DM)

   Packet Delay Measurement is a function that is used to measure one-
   way or two-way delay of a packet transmission between a pair of the
   end-points of a path (PW, LSP, or Section). Where:

   o One-way packet delay, as defined in [IPPM-1DM], is the time
      elapsed from the start of transmission of the first bit of the
      packet by a source node until the reception of the last bit of
      that packet by the destination node. Note that one-way delay
      measurement requires the clocks of the two end-points to be
      synchronized.

   o Two-way packet delay, as defined in [IPPM-2DM], is the time
      elapsed from the start of transmission of the first bit of the
      packet by a source node until the reception of the last bit of the
      loop-backed packet by the same source node, when the loopback is
      performed at the packet's destination node. Note that due to
      possible path asymmetry, the one-way packet delay from one end-
      point to another is not necessarily equal to half of the two-way
      packet delay.
      As opposed to one-way delay measurement, two-way delay measurement
      does not require the two end-points to be synchronized.

   For each of these two metrics, the DM function allows the MEP to
   measure the delay, as well as the delay variation. Delay measurement
   is performed by exchanging timestamped OAM packets between the
   participating MEPs.

4.6. Pseudowire OAM

4.6.1. Pseudowire OAM using Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification
   (VCCV)

   VCCV, as defined in [VCCV], provides a means for end-to-end fault
   detection and diagnostics tools to be extended for PWs (regardless of
   the underlying tunneling technology). The VCCV switching function
   provides a control channel associated with each PW. [VCCV] defines
   three Control Channel (CC) types, i.e., three possible methods for
   transmitting and identifying OAM messages:

   o CC Type 1: In-band VCCV, as described in [VCCV], is also referred
      to as "PWE3 Control Word with 0001b as first nibble".  It uses the
      PW Associated Channel Header [PW-ACH].

   o CC Type 2: Out-of-band VCCV [VCCV], is also referred to as "MPLS
      Router Alert Label". In this case the control channel is created
      by using the MPLS router alert label [RFC3032] immediately above
      the PW label.

   o CC Type 3: TTL expiry VCCV [VCCV], is also referred to as "MPLS PW
      Label with TTL == 1", i.e., the control channel is identified when
      the value of the TTL field in the PW label is set to 1.

   VCCV currently supports the following OAM tools: ICMP Ping, LSP Ping,
   and BFD. ICMP and LSP Ping are IP encapsulated before being sent over
   the PW ACH. BFD for VCCV [BFD-VCCV] supports two modes of
   encapsulation - either IP/UDP encapsulated (with IP/UDP header) or
   PW-ACH encapsulated (with no IP/UDP header) and provides support to
   signal the AC status. The use of the VCCV control channel provides
   the context, based on the MPLS-PW label, required to bind and
   bootstrap the BFD session to a particular pseudo wire (FEC),
   eliminating the need to exchange Discriminator values.

   VCCV consists of two components: (1) signaled component to
   communicate VCCV capabilities as part of VC label, and (2) switching
   component to cause the PW payload to be treated as a control packet.

   VCCV is not directly dependent upon the presence of a control plane.
   The VCCV capability negotiation may be performed as part of the PW
   signaling when LDP is used. In case of manual configuration of the
   PW, it is the responsibility of the operator to set consistent
   options at both ends. The manual option was created specifically to
   handle MPLS-TP use cases where no control plane was a requirement.
   However, new use cases such as pure mobile backhaul find this
   functionality useful too.

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


   The PWE3 working group has conducted an implementation survey of VCCV
   [VCCV-SURVEY], which analyzes which VCCV mechanisms are used in
   practice.

4.6.2. Pseudowire OAM using G-ACh

   As mentioned above, VCCV enables OAM for PWs by using a control
   channel for OAM packets. When PWs are used in MPLS-TP networks,
   rather than the control channels defined in VCCV, the G-ACh can be
   used as an alternative control channel. The usage of the G-ACh for
   PWs is defined in [PW-G-ACh].

4.6.3. Attachment Circuit - Pseudowire Mapping

   The PWE3 working group has defined a mapping and notification of
   defect states between a pseudowire (PW) and the Attachment Circuits
   (ACs) of the end-to-end emulated service. This mapping is of key
   importance to the end-to-end functionality. Specifically, the mapping
   is provided by [PW-MAP], by [L2TP-EC] for L2TPv3 pseudowires, and
   Section 5.3 of [ATM-L2] for ATM.

4.7. OWAMP and TWAMP

4.7.1. Overview

   The IPPM working group in the IETF defines common criteria and
   metrics for measuring performance of IP traffic ([IPPM-FW]). Some of
   the key RFCs published by this working group have defined metrics for
   measuring connectivity [IPPM-Con], delay ([IPPM-1DM], [IPPM-2DM]),
   and packet loss [IPPM-1LM]. It should be noted that the work of the
   IETF in the context of performance metrics is not limited to IP
   networks; [PM-CONS] presents general guidelines for considering new
   performance metrics.

   The IPPM working group has defined not only metrics for performance
   measurement, but also protocols that define how the measurement is
   carried out. The One-way Active Measurement Protocol [OWAMP] and the
   Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol [TWAMP] define a method and
   protocol for measuring performance metrics in IP networks.

   OWAMP [OWAMP] enables measurement of one-way characteristics of IP
   networks, such as one-way packet loss and one-way delay.  For its
   proper operation OWAMP requires accurate time of day setting at its
   end points.

   TWAMP [TWAMP] is a similar protocol that enables measurement of both
   one-way and two-way (round trip) characteristics.

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


   OWAMP and TWAMP are both comprised of two separate protocols:

   o OWAMP-Control/TWAMP-Control: used to initiate, start, and stop
      test sessions and to fetch their results. Continuity Check and
      Connectivity Verification are tested and confirmed by establishing
      the OWAMP/TWAMP Control Protocol TCP connection.

   o OWAMP-Test/TWAMP-Test: used to exchange test packets between two
      measurement nodes. Enables the loss and delay measurement
      functions, as well as detection of other anomalies, such as packet
      duplication and packet reordering.

   It should be noted that while [OWAMP] and [TWAMP] define tools for
   performance measurement, they do not define the accuracy of these
   tools. The accuracy depends on scale, implementation and network
   configurations.

   Alternative protocols for performance monitoring are defined, for
   example, in MPLS-TP OAM ([MPLS-LM-DM], [TP-LM-DM]), and in Ethernet
   OAM [ITU-T-Y1731].

4.7.2. Control and Test Protocols

   OWAMP and TWAMP control protocols run over TCP, while the test
   protocols run over UDP.  The purpose of the control protocols is to
   initiate, start, and stop test sessions, and for OWAMP to fetch
   results.  The test protocols introduce test packets (which contain
   sequence numbers and timestamps) along the IP path under test
   according to a schedule, and record statistics of packet arrival.
   Multiple sessions may be simultaneously defined, each with a session
   identifier, and defining the number of packets to be sent, the amount
   of padding to be added (and thus the packet size), the start time,
   and the send schedule (which can be either a constant time between
   test packets or exponentially distributed pseudo-random). Statistics
   recorded conform to the relevant IPPM RFCs.

   OWAMP and TWAMP test traffic is designed with security in mind. Test
   packets are hard to detect because they are simply UDP streams
   between negotiated port numbers, with potentially nothing static in
   the packets.  OWAMP and TWAMP also include optional authentication
   and encryption for both control and test packets.

4.7.3. OWAMP

   OWAMP defines the following logical roles: Session-Sender, Session-
   Receiver, Server, Control-Client, and Fetch-Client.  The Session-
   Sender originates test traffic that is received by the Session-


Mizrahi, et al.        Expires April 21, 2014                [Page 28]

Internet-Draft          Overview of OAM Tools             October 2013


   Receiver.  The Server configures and manages the session, as well as
   returning the results.  The Control-Client initiates requests for
   test sessions, triggers their start, and may trigger their
   termination.  The Fetch-Client requests the results of a completed
   session.  Multiple roles may be combined in a single host - for
   example, one host may play the roles of Control-Client, Fetch-Client,
   and Session-Sender, and a second playing the roles of Server and
   Session-Receiver.

   In a typical OWAMP session the Control-Client establishes a TCP
   connection to port 861 of the Server, which responds with a server
   greeting message indicating supported security/integrity modes. The
   Control-Client responds with the chosen communications mode and the
   Server accepts the modes.  The Control-Client then requests and fully
   describes a test session to which the Server responds with its
   acceptance and supporting information.  More than one test session
   may be requested with additional messages.  The Control-Client then
   starts a test session and the Server acknowledges.  The Session-
   Sender then sends test packets with pseudorandom padding to the
   Session-Receiver until the session is complete or until the Control-
   client stops the session.  Once finished, the Fetch-Client sends a
   fetch request to the server, which responds with an acknowledgement
   and immediately thereafter the result data.

4.7.4. TWAMP

   TWAMP defines the following logical roles: session-sender, session-
   reflector, server, and control-client.  These are similar to the
   OWAMP roles, except that the Session-Reflector does not collect any
   packet information, and there is no need for a Fetch-Client.

   In a typical TWAMP session the Control-Client establishes a TCP
   connection to port 862 of the Server, and mode is negotiated as in
   OWAMP.  The Control-Client then requests sessions and starts them.
   The Session-Sender sends test packets with pseudorandom padding to
   the Session-Reflector which returns them with insertion of
   timestamps.

4.8. TRILL

   The requirements of OAM in TRILL are defined in [TRILL-OAM]. The
   challenge in TRILL OAM, much like in MPLS networks, is that traffic
   between RBridges RB1 and RB2 may be forwarded through more than one
   path. Thus, an OAM protocol between RBridges RB1 and RB2 must be able
   to monitor all the available paths between the two RBridge.

   During the writing of this document the detailed definition of the
   TRILL OAM tools are still work in progress. This subsection presents
   the main requirements of TRILL OAM.

   The main requirements defined in [TRILL-OAM] are:

   o Continuity Checking (CC) - the TRILL OAM protocol must support a
      function for CC between any two RBridges RB1 and RB2.

   o Connectivity Verification (CV) - connectivity between two RBridges
      RB1 and RB2 can be verified on a per-flow basis.

   o Path Tracing - allows an RBridge to trace all the available paths
      to a peer RBridge.

   o Performance monitoring - allows an RBridge to monitor the packet
      loss and packet delay to a peer RBridge.

4.9. Summary of OAM Tools

   This subsection provides a short summary of each of the OAM tool
   categories described in this document.

Appendix A.                 List of OAM Documents

A.1. List of IETF OAM Documents

   Table 5 summarizes the OAM related RFCs published by the IETF.

   It is important to note that the table lists various RFCs that are
   different by nature. For example, some of these documents define OAM
   tools or OAM protocols (or both), while others define protocols that
   are not strictly OAM-related, but are used by OAM tools. The table
   also includes RFCs that define the requirements or the framework of
   OAM in a specific context (e.g., MPLS-TP).

   The RFCs in the table are categorized in a few sets as defined in
   Section 1.3.

A.2. List of Selected Non-IETF OAM Documents

   In addition to the OAM tools defined by the IETF, the IEEE and ITU-T
   have also defined various OAM tools that focus on Ethernet, and
   various other transport network environments. These various tools,
   defined by the three standard organizations, are often tightly
   coupled, and have had a mutual effect on each other. The ITU-T and
   IETF have both defined OAM tools for MPLS LSPs, [ITU-T-Y1711] and
   [LSP-Ping]. The following OAM standards by the IEEE and ITU-T are to
   some extent linked to IETF OAM tools listed above and are mentioned
   here only as reference material:

   o OAM tools for Layer 2 have been defined by the ITU-T in
      [ITU-T-Y1731], and by the IEEE in 802.1ag [IEEE802.1Q] . The IEEE
      802.3 standard defines OAM for one-hop Ethernet links
      [IEEE802.3ah].

   o The ITU-T has defined OAM for MPLS LSPs in [ITU-T-Y1711], and
      MPLS-TP OAM in [ITU-G8113.1] and [ITU-G8113.2].

   It should be noted that these non-IETF documents deal in many cases
   with OAM functions below the IP layer (Layer 2, Layer 2.5) and in

   some cases operators use a multi-layered OAM approach, which is a
   function of the way their networks are designed.

   Table 6 summarizes some of the main OAM standards published by non-
   IETF standard organizations. This document focuses on IETF OAM
   standards, but these non-IETF standards are referenced in this
   document where relevant.
