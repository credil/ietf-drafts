    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In view of today's huge significance of information and
         communication technologies in general and the Internet
         in particular, governments nowadays need to strongly
         take this highly technical realm in consideration in
         regard to various governmental responsibilities.</t>
      <t>Consequently, the so-called Tunis Agenda for the
         Information Society, an international soft law instrument
         adopted at the UN World Summit on Information Society in
         Tunis in 2005, appropriately asks the UN Secretary General
         to convene "a new forum for multi-stakeholder policy
         dialogue-called the Internet Governance Forum (IGF)" with a
         mandate that includes making recommendations where
         appropriate (see <xref target="Tunis"/>, para 72g).</t>
      <t>In this context of the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) which
         is explicitly mentioned in paras 67 and 72-78 of the Tunis
         Agenda <xref target="Tunis"/>, para 68 says
         that "We recognize that all governments should have an equal
         role and responsibility for international Internet governance
         and for ensuring the stability, security and continuity of
         the Internet. We also recognize the need for development of
         public policy by governments in consultation with all
         stakeholders." Paras 69-71 call for a process of "Enhanced
         Cooperation" with this objective: "to enable governments, on
         an equal footing, to carry out their roles and
         responsibilities, in international public policy issues
         pertaining to the Internet, but not in the day-to-day
         technical and operational matters, that do not impact on
         international public policy issues."</t>
      <t>Unfortunately, even though the Internet Governance Forum
	 has been created and it is very valuable, the UN system has
	 failed to implement the aspects of the IGF and Enhanced
         Cooperation which have been quoted above. The IGF does not
         make any recommendations, and the UN has not initiated such
         a process of Enhanced Cooperation as outlined in the
         Tunis Agenda, nor heeded calls for the establishment of a
	 multistakeholder working-group in this area as proposed
	 e.g. by <xref target="APC"/>. For more details see
         <xref target="Malcolm"/>.</t>
      <t>In view of how the UN generally operates, and in view of the
         various specific challenges in this topic area, it is not surprising
         that the UN has not or not yet achieved an implementation of
         the kind of Enhanced Cooperation that the Tunis Agenda calls
         for. Rather, the UN's success in establishing the IGF as a
         valuable and vibrant multistakeholder discussion forum is a
         significant achievement that should be built upon in
         establishing the Enhanced Cooperation of the Tunis Agenda.</t>
      <t>Drawing inspiration from how the Internet Engineering Task
         Force (IETF) works, the present memo proposes a way forward
         for meeting these Enhanced Cooperation needs.</t>
      <t>Here are some significant properties of this proposal:
           <list style="symbols">
            <t>The ECTF proposal provides a way to implement Enhanced
               Cooperation as foreseen by the Tunis Agenda without
               further undue delay. Those governments and other
               stakeholders who are interested in such Enhanced
               Cooperation can proceed to implement it, without being
               hindered by those who would prefer to avoid any change
               to the status quo.</t>
            <t>ECTF is designed to complement the IGF and benefit from
               synergies with the IGF. For example, ECTF Working-Group
               annual meetings will by default be organized as IGF
               pre-events.</t>
            <t>The IETF principles of great inclusiveness of
               participation and decision-making by rough
               consensus are built upon to minimize the risks of
               powerful stakeholders gaining undue influence.</t>
            <t>In the realm of intergovernmental Internet governance
               cooperation it is not immediately obvious whether a
               good analogue for the IETF principle of "running code"
               exists. The ECTF proposal is inspired by the idea that
               an operationalized emphasis on human rights together
               with the principle of evidence based decision making 
               might provide similarly valuable guidance to how
               IETF technical standardization work is guided by the
               "running code" principle.</t>
            <t>ECTF is not designed to supplant the role of national
               governments in deciding about which balance to choose
               between conflicting legitimate interests, a task which
               is a key part of just about every policy making process.
               Rather ECTF will improve the information input of such
               policy decision making process. This is important
               because if the information input is one-sided or
               rubbish in some other way, the resulting policy
               decisions will probably be badly unbalanced no matter
               how good and democratic the decision making process may
               be.</t>
           </list></t>

      <section title="Avoidance of Requirements Language">
        <t>This memo requests and recommends actions, but it does not
           define requirements. The use of the keywords of
           <xref target="RFC2119"/> describing requirement
           levels is therefore deliberately avoided.</t>

        <t>The Preparatory Working-Group described in
           <xref target="preparatory_wg"/>
           should not consider itself bound by any of the text in this
           memo, but rather it should feel free to reconsider and
           revise all of these recommendations.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="preparatory_wg" title="Preparatory Working-Group">
      <t>A Preparatory Working-Group with reasonably well-balanced
         multistakeholder participation shall be convened to review
         and revise the contents of this memo.</t>
      <t>The work of this Preparatory Working-Group could begin with
         an in-person kick-off meeting which might be a one-day
         pre-event for the 2013 Internet Governance Forum.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="draft_scope" title="Draft Scope Statement for ECTF">
      <t>As per the need for enhanced cooperation recognized in
         paras 68-70 of the Tunis Agenda <xref target="Tunis"/>,
         ECTF's scope of work shall be to facilitate enhanced
         cooperation of governments with each other and with other
         organizations, enabling them to carry out their roles and
         responsibilities in regard to international public policy
         issues pertaining to the Internet.</t>
      <t>In particular, ECTF shall provide a framework that allows
         governments and governmental organizations to conduct
         policy consultations regarding information society
         topics of international scope in such a way that inputs
         from the broadest possible variety of stakeholders are
         distilled, by means of rough consensus processes, into
         concrete, internationally applicable recommendations.</t>
      <t>Day-to-day technical and operational matters, that do not
         impact on international public policy issues, are not
         included in ECTF's remit.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="draft_rules" title="Draft Working Directives for ECTF">
      <t>This section provides a draft set of rules that should be
         carefully considered and revised by the ECTF Preparatory
         Working-Group, with the goal of creating a good initial
         Working Directives document for ECTF. The Preparatory
         Working-Group should at all times conduct its activities
         in accordance with what the current draft Working Directives
         say about how an ECTF Working-Group conducts its work. In
         this way, the Preparatory Working-Group will be conducting
         an initial test of how the draft directives work in practice,
         and any unreasonably burdensome rules can be recognized and
         fixed quickly.</t>

      <section anchor="values" title="Fundamental Values">
        <t>The fundamental values of the ECTF are that the human rights, as
           defined in the various international human rights treaties,
           shall be upheld and implemented in every way possible.</t>
        <t>Evidence-based arguments on how these objectives can be
           best achieved shall be given precedence over more
           speculative arguments.</t>
        <t>ECTF Working-Groups shall seek to provide, by means of the
           Request For Action documents that they publish, the best
           possible information input to the processes of national
           governments and other governance institutions that make
           policy decisions. The Working-Groups shall seek to collect,
           by means of a balanced multistakeholder process,
           information about needs, concerns, cause-effect
           relationships, and available evidence, and to process 
	   all this to the extent possible into recommendations. The
           Working-Groups shall particularly pay attention to any
           relevant proceedings at the IGF. At the very least, every
           Working-Group should be able to reach rough consensus on
           recommendations of the form "Public policy regarding topic
           X should take into consideration the following needs and
           concerns... ." Ideally (but with greater difficulty of
           reaching rough consensus) specific proposals for laws and
           others kinds of public policy decisions should be developed
           in a form that explicitly suggests a choice of options for
           possible choices of the balance between conflicting
           legitimate interests, together with information on what is
           known about the advantages and disadvantages (from the
           public interest perspective) of the different options.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="wg_rules" title="WG Working Procedures">
        <t>ECTF Working-Groups are generally free to define their own
           working procedures subject to the constraints that everyone
           without restriction must be welcome to participate as long
           as they participate constructively, and that decisions are
           made by the principle of rough consensus.</t>
        <t>Unless foreseen differently in the Terms of Reference of a
           Working Group, or the Working-Group decides otherwise, the
           ECTF Secretariat (see <xref target="secretariat"/>) shall
           use its discretion in setting up electronic communication
           infrastructure (such as an email mailing list) for the
           Working-Group, and in organizing in-person meetings, and in
           reminding participants, when this may be necessary, of the
           principles of professionally respectful conduct, or of
           international human rights law, or of the Terms of
           Reference of the particular Working-Group.</t>
        <t>If and only if such reminders prove ineffective, the
           Secretariat shall request the Committee
           (see <xref target="committee"/>) to decide an appropriate
	   sanction which may take the form of barring specific
           persons from participation in ECTF for a specific amount of
           time. The Committee can decide to impose such sanctions
           only by consensus or rough consensus but not by majority
           voting.</t>
        <t>Unless foreseen differently in the Terms of Reference of a
           Working-Group, or the Working-Group decides otherwise, the
           ECTF Secretariat shall organize, for each Working-Group,
           an annual in-person meeting as an IGF pre-event.</t>
        <t>All ECTF Working-Groups shall seek to interact with the
           broader Internet Governance community by active
           participation in the IGF.</t>
        <t>All electronic communication infrastructure shall be fully
           accessible using a variety of computer operating systems,
           using Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), and using

          <t>Unless the Working-Group made the decision to publish the

             with the Terms of Reference of the Working-Group.</t>
          <t>The Secretariat shall verify that the Working-Group which
             made the request has Active status. (All Working-Groups
             have Active status initially, this status can change to
             Inactive in case of Sustaining Member disendorsements, see

          Request For Action document may instruct the Secretariat to
          issue a Consensus Call for Overall Rough Consensus Endorsement
          by ECTF.</t>
       <t>In this case the Secretariat shall communicate to all ECTF
          participants a request to review that Request For Action
          document and communicate any objections within 90 days.</t>
       <t>If any objections are received, the Working-Group shall
          review the objections and decide whether it wants to revise
          the Request For Action document.</t>
       <t>If no objections are received, or if the Working-Group
          otherwise decides not to revise the Request For Action
          document, it may ask for a determination whether there is
          Overall Rough Consensus of ECTF. Overall Rough Consensus
          means that there must be rough consensus among each of the
          major stakeholder categories: Governments, civil society and
          industry. The determination of Overall Rough Consensus is
          made by the Committee of Sustaining Members, see
          <xref target="committee"/> below.</t>  
       <t>If it is determined that there is overall Overall Rough
          Consensus, the Secretariat shall add information to this

            rule is to ensure that if different groups of Sustaining
            Members propose different frameworks to address the same
            problem, so that one of them is clearly better from a
            human rights perspective, then precedence is appropriately
            given to the better framework.</t>
         <t>When it has been decided that establishment of the
            Working-Group is appropriate, the Secretariat shall set up
            appropriate communications infrastructure and add the new
            Working-Group to the list of ECTF Working-Groups, with
            Active status. Furthermore, the Secretariat shall inform
            about the new Working-Group all registered participants
            including the sustaining members, as well as the general
            public, and all known civil society organizations with

           not only when the tasks of a Working-Group have been completed,
           but also if it becomes clear that progress is only
           possible by creating a new Working-Group on essentially
           the same topic but with Terms of Reference that provide
           more specific guidance which makes it easier to reach rough

        <t>Decisions of budget and staffing of the ECTF Secretariat
           shall be made by a Committee of Sustaining Members, as
           follows: From each of the four categories of
           Sustaining Members, up to five representatives may
           be delegated to the Committee, so that in total the
           committee consists of up to twenty persons.</t>
        <t>When in any category of Sustaining Members there are
           five or less Sustaining Members in the category, they
           shall each be invited to delegate a person to the
           Committee.</t>
        <t>When in any category of Sustaining Members there are
           more than five Sustaining Members, they shall attempt
           to agree among themselves on a way of selecting five
           representatives (for example by adopting a system of
           rotation). If they cannot agree and more than five want to
           be on the Committee, the Secretariat shall randomly choose,
           for a two-year term, five from among those who want to be
           on the Committee.</t>
        <t>The Committee shall attempt to make decisions by rough
           consensus. If this fails, decisions regarding the
           Secretariat may be taken at a meeting at which decision
           making by majority vote is allowed, which may be convened no
           earlier than 16 hours after the rough consensus process
           has failed.</t>
        <t>The Committee shall review any proposed changes to the ECTF
           Working Directives before publication as a Request For Action
           document. It shall communicate any concerns to the
           Working-Group which is proposing changes to the Working
           Directives.</t>
        <t>The Committee is also responsible for the determination of
           Overall Rough Consensus, see <xref target="overall_endorsement"/>.
           The decision of determination of Overall Rough Consensus needs
           to be reached by rough consensus of the Committee; if the
           Committee fails to reach rough consensus, the Request For Action
           document in question shall not be considered to have attained
           Overall Rough Consensus. This applies also to the Consensus
           Call in the context of changes to the ECTF Working Directives
           (see <xref target="directives_change"/> the difference being only
           that that Consensus Call involves only the Sustaining Members.</t>

        <section anchor="funding" title="Secretariat Funding">
         <t>Organizations which are interested in being Sustaining
         Industry Members shall make, for a specific number of years,
         a commitment that they are willing to contribute to funding
         the costs of the secretariat up to a specific amount.</t>
	 <t>Independently of whether this commitment is actually
	 called upon (see below) a maximal set of Sustaining
         Industry Members is chosen so that the yearly commitment
	 limit of each Sustaining Industry Members is greater or equal
	 than the budget of ECTF divided by the number of Sustaining
	 Industry Members.</t>
         <t>The Country Members as a group have the right to organize
         a way of funding ECTF which is independent of the Sustaining
         Industry Members. In that case the commitments of the Sustaining
         Industry Members are not called upon.</t>
         <t>Unless the Country Members make use of this right, the
         Secretariat and the Committee shall seek to ensure adequate
         funding by means of one or more of the following sources of
         funds: Voluntary contributions, grants from foundations and/or
         other grant-giving institutions, calling upon the Sustaining
         Industry Members to each contribute an equal amount.</t>
         <t>If there are no Sustaining Industry Members and the
         operations of the Secretariat have also not been adequately
         funded otherwise, the Secretariat shall have the authority to
         suspend some of its operations, according to its sole
         discretion.</t>
         <t>If the Committee intends to increase the budget of the
         Secretariat, the Committee shall, before making the decision
         to do so, secure commitments that sufficient funding will be
         made available. Furthermore, the Committee shall regularly
         assess the risk of available funding potentially dropping
         below the level of the current budget, and appropriate
         contingency plans shall be made.</t>

         among all Sustaining Members. If and only if there is rough
         consensus among each category of Sustaining Members for
         adoption of the revised Directives (as determined by the
         Committee, see <xref target="committee"/>), the Secretariat
         shall put them in force by publishing a Request For Action
         document that gives the details about how the new version was
         adopted, and requests the new version of the Directives to be
         followed from now on.</t>
         <t>Country Members or International Organization Members may
         propose to make ECTF part of the UN or another existing or
         new treaty-based international organization. Such a proposal
         needs to be approved in the same way by rough consensus of
         all sustaining members of ECTF, in addition to whatever other
         steps may be required to create a new umbrella organization
         for ECTF.</t>

         to make any substantive progress towards its objectives,
         the Secretariat shall take the following steps: First the
         Secretariat shall verify that this is indeed the case. If
         yes, the Secretariat shall solicit nominations and
         self-nominations from among the Working-Group members of
         potential chairpersons who could organize the work of the
         Working-Group. If at least one person is nominated, the
         Secretariat shall appoint a chairperson. If no-one is
         nominated, the Secretariat shall dissolve the Working-Group.</t>
         <t>Working-Groups may also by means of a rough consensus
         decision request and empower the Secretariat to execute this
         process of chairperson appointment. The Secretariat shall

      <t>The Preparatory Working-Group will not itself create these

         Request For Action document with recommended Working Directives,
         also a Request For Action document recommending Terms of

        <t>Rationale: According to para 72(i) in the Tunis Agenda this

        are currently in the hands of NTIA. The WG shall publish this
        proposal as a Request For Action document. This document shall
        particularly emphasize the measures for ensuring the integrity
        of the DNS root zone file by preventing (intentional or
        unintentional) inappropriate modifications, while avoiding
        undue delays of appropriate modifications.</t>
        <t>Rationale: Many people, governments and civil society
        organizations, especially outside the US, consider the current
        situation unsatisfactory or even unacceptable. ICANN, ISOC,
        and the RIRs are also all on the record favoring a shift.</t>

        <t>This WG shall observe, compare and discuss the legal
        frameworks and procedures of various countries in regard to
        how law enforcement agencies deal with the challenges and
        opportunities of the Internet. The WG shall regularly publish
        Request For Action documents with its findings, emphasizing
        in particular any undesired side effects on human rights
        (such as for example when connection data is stored by ISPs
        on the basis of data retention demands for law enforcement
        purposes, but the data is at least sometimes abused for
        other purposes) and the importance of finding an appropriate,
        evidence-based balance between law enforcement needs and other
        human rights. The WG shall furthermore study what kinds of
        technical changes to the Internet infrastructure would be
        possible in order to better meet the needs of law enforcement,
        and if it turns out that such technical changes would be
        possible without significant negative impacts on other human
        rights, the WG shall publish Request For Action documents with
        corresponding recommendations.</t>
        <t>Rationale: Numerous governments have spoken, e.g. at ICANN
        and RIR meetings, about the need for more regard for the needs
        of law enforcement. On the other hand, many civil society
        organizations are concerned that some measures that law
        enforcement agencies would propose may have highly negative
        side effects on fundamental rights of privacy and freedom of
        expression.</t>

      <section anchor="irp" title="Internet Rights and Principles WG">

        human rights in the Internet context and on guiding principles
        for Internet governance to further human rights.</t>
        <t>Rationale: The current situation with so many independently

        may be desirable, the WG shall publish a Request For Action
        document with revised Working Directives and an appendix that
        explains the rationale for the changes. This document shall
        not be phrased as definitely containing the new Working
        Directives, but rather as a request to the body of Sustaining
        Members of ECTF to adopt the proposed new Working Directives.
        (Adoption of such a revised Working Directives document is
        done by rough consensus among the Sustaining Members of

      <t>Similarly to security considerations for technical systems

         attempts of "inappropriate usage" and "denial of service".
         In addition, the integrity of ECTF work with regards to
         human rights needs to be safeguarded.</t>

      <section anchor="inappropriate_usage" title="Inappropriate Usage">
        <t>Clearly ECTF needs rules governing the interaction between
	  participants. In the absence of appropriate rules,
	  participation in ECTF cannot be expected to be effective,
          time-efficient and a pleasant experience.</t>
        <t>These rules need to be designed so that bona
	  fide well-intentioned newcomers with reasonably good
	  communication skills will be able to quickly learn how to 
	  participate effectively, while on the other hand there

      <section anchor="denial_of_service" title="Denial of Service">
        <t>It is particularly important to avoid vulnerability of ECTF

          is called "denial of service" attacks in the technical realm:
	  It must not be possible for beneficiaries of the status quo
