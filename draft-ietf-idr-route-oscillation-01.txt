In particular configurations, the BGP scaling mechanisms defined in
"BGP Route Reflection - An Alternative to Full Mesh IBGP" and
"Autonomous System Confederations for BGP" will introduce persistent
BGP route oscillation.  This document discusses the two types of
persistent route oscillation that have been identified, describes
when these conditions will occur, and provides some network design
guidelines to avoid introducing such occurrences.

This document is a product of the Inter-Domain Routing Working Group
