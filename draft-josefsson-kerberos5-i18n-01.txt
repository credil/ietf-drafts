           Kerberos V5 Internationalization of Error Messages
                   draft-josefsson-kerberos5-i18n-01

Abstract

   This document describes an internationalization extension for the
   Kerberos V5 protocol.  The extension allows error messages to be sent
   in the users' language.  This document updates RFC 4120 to add a new
   PA-DATA type and to modify the protocol logic related to KRB-ERROR
   when the new PA-DATA extension is negotiated.

Internet-Draft               KRB-ERROR i18n                   March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Kerberos V5 [RFC4120] specification uses the KRB-ERROR packet to
   signal error conditions.  The KRB-ERROR packet contains a field
   "e-text" which holds additional text to explain the error.  The
   "e-text" ASN.1 type is KerberosString, which may only contain US-
   ASCII characters.  Traditionally the field has been used to send
   error messages in English.

   There is a desire to provide error messages in the users' own
   language.  This document specifies how clients and KDC negotiate
   support for a internationalization extension.  When the extension is
   negotiated, this document goes on to describe how the KRB-ERROR
   packet is modified in order to support translated error messages.

   This document updates RFC 4120 to add a new PA-DATA type and to
   modify the protocol logic related to KRB-ERROR when the new PA-DATA
   extension is negotiated.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Negotiating Support for Internationalization

   The client can request support for internationalization by including
   a PA-DATA element with padata-type of PA-I18N in the KDC-REQ.  The
   PA-DATA carry a list in preference order to indicate the languages
   the client needs error messages in.  The languages tags are described
   by [RFC5646].

3.1.  PA-I18N

        Language-Tag      ::= IA5String
                              -- RFC 5646 Language-Tag

        PA-I18N           ::= SEQUENCE OF Language-Tag

   An empty list can be used to signal support of this extension without
   requesting any particular languages.

   The KDC MAY include a PA-DATA element with a padata-type of PA-I18N
   in the KDC-REP message, containing a list of languages supported by
   the KDC.  This can be useful if the languages preferred by the client

   is not supported by the KDC, to allow clients to more easily select
   another language tag.


4.  Internationalization of KRB-ERROR

   When the PA-I18N extension is negotiated the server MAY send the
   following structure wherever a KRB-ERROR packet can be sent.

      KRB-I18N-ERROR       ::= [APPLICATION 4] SEQUENCE {
              pvno            [0] INTEGER (5),
              msg-type        [1] INTEGER (30),
              ctime           [2] KerberosTime OPTIONAL,
              cusec           [3] Microseconds OPTIONAL,
              stime           [4] KerberosTime,
              susec           [5] Microseconds,
              error-code      [6] Int32,
              crealm          [7] Realm OPTIONAL,
              cname           [8] PrincipalName OPTIONAL,
              realm           [9] Realm -- service realm --,
              sname           [10] PrincipalName -- service name --,
              e-text          [11] SEQUENCE OF ErrorMessage,
              e-data          [12] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
      }

      ErrorMessage          ::= SEQUENCE {
              langtag         [0] IA5String -- RFC 5646 Language-Tag --,
              msg             [1] UTF8String
      }

   Compared to KRB-ERROR, this changes the type of the "e-text" field
   from KerberosString to ErrorMessage.  The APPLICATION tag is changed
   from 30 to 4 to help automatic decoding of KRB-ERROR and KRB-I18N-
   ERROR.

   The "ErrorMessage" type holds one error message in a specific
   language.

   The "langtag" field follows the Language-Tag format [RFC5646].

   The "msg" field holds the text message, encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629].

   The "e-text" field holds a list of "ErrorMessage" structures.  Each
   member of the list will contain the error message in a particular
   language.

   The languages of messages returned will be in a sub-set of languages
   requested by the client.  The server MAY return strings in other

   languages as well.  It is RECOMMENDED that KDC always return the
   error message in the "en" (English) language.  This improves
   debugging and logging.


5.  Security Considerations

   If a client requests a large number of languages, it can consume a
   significant amount of resources on the KDC and will also increase the
   packet size.  This can be used as a denial of service attack.  KDCs
   can chose to temporarily disable translations for a particular
   client, or require that clients pre-authenticates themselves.


6.  IANA Considerations
