    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in <xref
	target="RFC1034"/> and <xref target="RFC1035"/>. This base
	specification defines many Resource Record Types (RRTypes),
	and subsequent specifications have defined others. Each
	defined RRType provides a means of encoding particular data
	in the DNS.</t>

      <t><xref target="EUI48">48-bit Extended Unique Identifiers
	(EUI-48)</xref> and <xref target="EUI64">64-bit Extended
	Unique Identifiers (EUI-64)</xref> are address formats
	specified by the IEEE for use in various layer-2 networks,
	e.g. Ethernet.</t>

      <t>This document defines two new RRTypes, EUI48 and EUI64
	for encoding EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses in the DNS.</t>

      <t>There are potentially severe privacy implications resulting
	from the indiscriminate publication of link-layer addresses
	in the DNS (see <xref target="security"/>).  This document
	recommends that EUI-48 or EUI-64 addresses SHOULD NOT be
	published in the public DNS. This document specifies an
	interoperable encoding of these address types for use in
	private DNS namespaces, where the privacy implications can
	be constrained and mitigated.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This document uses capitalised keywords such as MUST and
	MAY to describe the requirements for using the registered
	RRTypes.  The intended meaning of those keywords in this
	document are the same as those described in <xref
	target="RFC2119"/>. Although these keywords are often used
	to specify normative requirements in IETF Standards, their
	use in this document does not imply that this document is
	a standard of any kind.</t>

    <section title="Example Use-Case: IP Address Tracking in DOCSIS Networks">
      <t>Canadian cable Internet subscribers are assigned IP
	addresses using DHCP, using a DHCP server operated by a
	cable company.  In the case where a cable company provides
	last-mile connectivity to a subscriber on behalf of a third
	party company (reseller), the DHCP server assigns addresses
	from a pool supplied by the reseller. The reseller retains
	knowledge of the EUI-48 address of the DOCSIS modem supplied
	to the subscriber, but has no direct knowledge of the IP
	addresses assigned. In order for the reseller to be able
	to map the IP address assigned to a subscriber to that
	EUI-48 address (and hence to the subscriber identity), the
	cable company can make available information from the DHCP
	server which provides that (EUI-48, IP) address mapping.</t>

      <t>Cable companies in Canada are required <xref target="NTRE038D"/>
	to make this address mapping available using the DNS. Zones
	containing the relevant information are published on DNS
	servers, access to which is restricted to the resellers
	corresponding to particular sets of subscribers. Subscriber
        address information is not published in the public DNS.</t>

      <t>Existing DNS schemas for the representation of (EUI-48,
	IP) mapping used by Canadian cable companies are varied and
	inefficient; in the absence of a RRType for direct encoding
	of EUI-48 addresses, addresses are variously encoded into
	owner names or are published in TXT records.</t>

      <t>The specification in this document facilitates a more
	efficient, consistent and reliable representation of (EUI-48,
	IP) mapping than was previously available.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DNS Protocol Considerations">
      <t>The specification of the new RRTypes in this document has
	no effect on the address resolution behaviour of any previously
	existing network processes or protocols. Proposals or
	specifications to modify or augment address resolution
	processes or protocols by making use of these RRTypes should
	specify how any address conflicts or use of multiple
	EUI48/EUI64 RRs are handled.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA has assigned the RRType value 108 (decimal) for EUI48
	and 109 (decimal) for EUI64. This document directs the IANA
	to confirm that the corresponding entries in the <eref
	target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xml#dns-parameters-3">"Resource
	Record (RR) TYPEs" sub-registry</eref> match the following
	data:</t>

        <c>this document</c>
      </texttable>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
      <t>There are privacy concerns with the publication of link-layer
	addresses in the DNS. EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses with the
	Global bit zero <xref target="RFC5342"/> are intended to
	represent unique identifiers for network connected equipment
	(notwithstanding many observed cases of duplication due to
	manufacturing errors, unauthorised use of OUIs, and address
	spoofing through configuration of network interfaces).
	Publication of EUI-48 or EUI-64 addresses in the DNS may
	result in privacy issues in the form of unique trackable
	identities.</t>

      <t>For example, although IP addresses and DNS names for network
	devices typically change over time, EUI-48 and EUI-64
	addresses configured on the same devices are normally far
	more stable (in many cases, effectively invariant).
	Publication of EUI-48 addresses associated with user devices
	in a way that could be mapped to assigned IP addresses would
	allow the behaviour of those users to be tracked by third
	parties, regardless of where and how the user's device is
	connected to the Internet. This might well result in a loss
	of privacy for the user.</t>

      <t>These concerns can be mitigated by restricting access to
	DNS zones containing EUI48 or EUI64 RRs to specific,
	authorised clients and by provisioning them in DNS zones
	that exist in private namespaces only.</t>

      <t>This document recommends that EUI-48 or EUI-64 addresses
	SHOULD NOT be published in the public DNS.</t>

                 DNS RRTYPE PARAMETER ALLOCATION TEMPLATE

   A. Submission Date: 2013-03-18

   B.1 Submission Type:  [X] New RRTYPE  [ ] Modification to RRTYPE
   B.2 Kind of RR:  [X] Data RR  [ ] Meta-RR

   C. Contact Information for submitter (will be publicly posted):
         Name: Joe Abley

   D. Motivation for the new RRTYPE application.

      The purpose of this RRTYPE application is to allow EUI-48
      and EUI-64 addresses to be stored in the DNS. EUI-48
      addresses are those used, for example, in ethernet.

   E. Description of the proposed RR type.

      See draft-jabley-dnsext-eui48-eui64-rrtypes for a full
      description.

   F. What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that
      need and why are they unsatisfactory?

      The TXT record can be used to store arbitrary, unstructured
      data in the DNS and hence could be used to store EUI-48 and
      EUI-64 addresses. This approach is unsatisfactory for the
      usual reasons, i.e. there is no opportunity for validating
      data before it is stored, and typographical errors must
      consequently be detected after data retrieval.

   G. What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?

      EUI48 for EUI-48 addresses; EUI64 for EUI-64 addresses.

   H. Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA
      registry or require the creation of a new IANA sub-registry
      in DNS Parameters?  If so, please indicate which registry is
      to be used or created. If a new sub-registry is needed, specify
      the allocation policy for it and its initial contents. Also
      include what the modification procedures will be.

      No.

   I. Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
      servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being processed
      as an unknown RRTYPE (see [RFC3597])?

      No.

   J. Comments:

      See draft-jabley-dnsext-eui48-eui64-rrtypes for a complete
      specification.
