This document describes an architecture for describing Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Frameworks.  The architecture is
designed to be modular to allow the evolution of the SNMP protocol
standards over time.  The major portions of the architecture are an
SNMP engine containing a Message Processing Subsystem, a Security
Subsystem and an Access Control Subsystem, and possibly multiple SNMP
applications which provide specific functional processing of
management data.  This document obsoletes RFC 2571.

This document is a product of the SNMPv3 Working Group of the IETF. 

This is now a Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
