               A YANG Data Model for Open IPv6 Transition
               draft-zhou-netmod-openv6-transition-cfg-00

Abstract

   During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, there are many kinds of
   transition methods and scenarios that have been or are currently
   being defined in IETF, e.g., DS-Lite, Lw4over6, MAP-E, 4rd, 6rd and
   etc.  Carriers have to select and determine their transition ways
   among all of these techniques, which brings slow transition to IPv6.
   Currently, we face two main challenges in IPv6 transition: the legacy
   equipment does not support multiple IPv6 transition technologies at
   the same time and there are not enough native IPv6 applications.
   This document describes an open IPv6 YANG [RFC6020] data model which
   serves as a framework for configuring and managing an IPv6 service to
   provide a low-cost and unified way to IPv6 transition.

1.  Introduction

   Each IPv6 transition technology has its own specific characteristics.
   In order to support a specific IPv6 transition scheme and not need to
   upgrade the devices, we propose two elements for OSS to configure the
   IPv6 service related parameters: the resource template and the flow
   table template.  These two elements together define the so-called
   open IPv6 data model, which is proposed as a basis for the
   development of data models for configuration and management of the
   specific IPv6 transition technology.  This data model could
   accommodate existing and future IPv6 transition schemes.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:

   o  Resource template: the template for IP pool and port/port set;

   o  Flow table template: the template for various transition
      technologies, described by NAT and/or tunnel.

3.  Objectives

   The initial design of the open IPv6 data model was driven by the
   following objectives:

   o  The data model should support the particular technology (any of
      the v4-v6 transition technology).  The resource template and the
      flow table template should be general templates suitable for all
      the transition schemes;

   o  The users/applications should be able to decide for themselves
      when and how to start the IPv6 transition;

   o  The data model is generic and protocol-independent for packets and
      flow-tables interaction between network devices and applications.

   o  Provides the management functions (e.g.,OSS) for the applications
      to configure and manage the installed modules in the network
      devices.

4.  The Design of the Open IPv6 Transition Data Model

   The open IPv6 transition data model consists of two YANG modules.
   The first module, "flow table", defines the action (tunnel and NAT)
   of a specific transiton technology.  The other module, "resource",
   defines the general IP prefix and port set/mapping rules for a
   specific transition technology.  Figure 1 show abridged views of the
   configuration and operational state data hierarchies.

4.1.  Flow Table

   The flow table element defines the two basic components of a specific
   IPv6 transition technology: tunnel and translation.

   The main attributes of the tunnel are explained as below:

   o  "inner-ip-address-src": the source ip address of a packet or inner
      source ip address when the packet type is IP-in-IP tunnel;

   o  "inner-ip-address-dst":the dstination ip address of a packet or
      inner dstination ip address when the packet type is IP-in-IP
      tunnel;

   o  "outer-ip-address-src": the source ip address of a packet or outer
      source ip address when the packet type is IP-in-IP tunnel;

   o  "outer-ip-address-dst": the destination ip address of a packet or
      outer destination ip address when the packet type is IP-in-IP
      tunnel.

   The IP address could be IPv4 or IPv6 dependending on the
   technologies.

   The main attributes of the translation are explained as below:

   o  "inner-ip-address": the source ip address of a packet;

   o  "outer-ip-addresss":the dstination ip address of a packet;

   o  "inner-port": the source port of a packet;

   o  "outer-port": the destination port of a packet.

   The IP address could be IPv4 or IPv6 depending on the specific
   technologies.

4.2.  Resource

   The resource element defines the general IP pool and the port set of
   the specific transition technology if the ipv4 address sharing
   mechanism is adopted.
