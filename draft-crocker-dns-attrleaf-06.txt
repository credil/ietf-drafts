                DNS Scoped Data Through Attribute Leaves
                     draft-crocker-dns-attrleaf-06

Abstract

   Historically, any DNS RR may occur for any domain name.  Recent
   additions have defined DNS leaf nodes that contain a reserved node
   name, beginning with an underscore.  The underscore construct is used
   to define a semantic scope for DNS records associated with the parent
   domain.  This note explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines
   the "underscore names" registry with IANA.

Internet-Draft  DNS Scoped Data Through Attribute Leaves    October 2011


1.  Introduction

   The core DNS technical specifications assign no semantics to domain
   names or their parts, and no constraints upon which resource records
   (RRs) may be associated with particular names.  Over time, some leaf
   node names, such as "www" and "ftp" have come to imply support for
   particular services, but this is a matter of operational convention,
   rather than defined protocol semantics.  This freedom in the basic
   technology has permitted a wide range of administrative and semantic
   policies to be used -- in parallel.  Data semantics have been limited
   to the specification of particular resource records, on the
   expectation that new ones would be added as needed.

   Some recent service enhancements have defined a restricted scope for
   the occurrence of particular resource records.  That scope is a leaf
   node, within which the uses of specific resource records can be
   formally defined and constrained.  The leaf has a distinguished
   naming convention: It uses a reserved DNS node name that begins with
   an underscore.  Because host names are not allowed to use the
   underscore character, this distinguishes the name from all legal host
   name.  Effectively, this convention creates a space for attributes
   that are associated with the parent domain, one level up.

   An established example is the SRV record [RFC2782] which generalizes
   concepts long-used for email routing by the MX record
   [RFC0974][RFC2821].  The use of special DNS names has significant
   benefits and detriments.  Some of these are explored in [RFC5507].

   [Comment]:   The terms "resolution context" and "scoping rules" have
      been suggested, in place of "semantic scope".  In order to avoid
      concern for matters of semantics, this specification uses the term
      "scoping rules", to create a focus on the mechanics being defined,
      rather than nuances of interpretation for the mechanism.

   The scoping feature is particularly useful when generalized resource
   records are used -- notably TXT and SRV.  It provides efficient
   separation of one use of them from another.  Absent this separation,
   an undifferentiated mass of these RRs are returned to the client
   which then must parse through the internals of the records in the
   hope of finding ones that are relevant.  With underscore-based
   scoping, only the relevant RRs are returns.

   This specification discusses the underscore "attribute" enhancement,
   provides an explicit definition of it, and establishes an IANA
   registry for the reserved names that begin with underscore.

   Discussion Venue:   Discussion about this draft is directed to the
      dnsop@lists.uoregon.edu [1] mailing list of the IETF DNSOP Working
      Group [2].


2.  Scaling Benefits and TXT and SRV Resource Records

   Some resource records are generic and support a variety of uses.
   Each additional use defines its own rules and, possibly, its own
   internal syntax and node-naming conventions to distinguish among
   particular types.  The TXT and SRV records are the notable examples.
   Used freely, some of these approaches scale poorly, particularly when
   the same RR can be present in the same leaf node, but with different
   uses.  An increasingly-popular approach, with excellent scaling
   properties, uses an underscore-based name to a define place in the
   DNS that is constrained to particular uses for particular RRs.  This
   means that a direct lookup produces only the desired records, at no
   greater cost than a typical lookup.

   In the case of TXT records, different uses have developed largely
   without coordination.  One side-effect is that there is no
   consistently distinguishable internal syntax for the record; even
   internal inspection might not be a reliable means of distinguishing
   among the different uses.  Underscore-based names therefore provide
   an administrative way of separating TXT records that might have
   different uses, but otherwise would have no syntactic markers for
   distinguishing among them.

   In the case of the SRV RR distinguishing among different types of use
   was part of the design.  [RFC2782] The SRV specification serves as a
   template, defining an RR that may only be used for specific
   applications when there is an additional specification.  The template
   definition includes reference to tables of names from which
   underscore-names should be drawn.  The set of <service> names is
   defined in terms of other IANA tables, namely any table with symbolic
   names.  The other SRV naming field is <proto>, although its pool of
   names is not explicitly defined.


3.  Underscore DNS          Registry Function

   This specification defines a registry for DNS nodes names, used to
   define scope of use for specific resource records (RR).  A given name
   defines a specific, constrained context for the use of such records.
   This does not constrain the use of other resource records that are
   not specified.  The purpose of the registry is to avoid collisions
   resulting from the use of the same underscore name, for different
   applications.

   Structurally, the registry is defined as a single, flat table of
   names that begin with underscore.  In some cases, such as for SRV, an
   underscore name might be multi-part, as a sequence of names.
   Semantically, this is a hierarchical model, thereby making a flat
   registry unexpected.

   The registry requires such hierarchies to be registered as a
   combinatorial case analysis set, with each entry being a full
   sequence of underscore names.  Given a scheme that is actually
   structured, this flat design is inelegant.  However it has the
   benefit of being extremely simple, with the added advantage of being
   easier for readers to understand, as long as these cases are small
   and few.

                      +----------------------------+
                      | NAME                       |
                      +----------------------------+
                      | _service1                  |
                      | _service2._protoB          |
                      | _service3._protoC          |
                      | _service3._protoC          |
                      | _service4._protoD._useX    |
                      | _protoE._region._authority |
                      +----------------------------+

                        Example of Underscore Names

   The flat registry design:

   o  provides significantly simpler administration than is needed for
      hierarchical tables, simples, and

   o  is significantly simpler for readers to understand and is likely
      to produce fewer programming or administration errors.


4.  DNS Underscore Registry Definition

   A registry entry MUST contain:



      Name:   Specifies a textual name for a scoped portion of the DNS.
         The name will usually be taken from the specification cited in
         the "Purpose" column and is intended for use in discussions
         about the entry.

      DNS Label(s):   Specifies a sequence of one or more underscore
         names that define a single name reservation.

      Constraints:   Specifies any restrictions on use of the name.

      RR(s):   Lists the RRs that are defined for use within this scope.

      References  Lists specifications that define the records and their
         use under this Name.

      Purpose:   Specifies the particular purpose/use for specific
         RR(s), defined for use within the scope of the registered
         underscore name.


5.  IANA Considerations

   Per [RFC2434], IANA is requested to establish a DNS Underscore Name
   Registry, for DNS node names that begin with the underscore character
   (_) and have been specified in any published RFC, or are documented
   by a specification published by another standards organization.  The
   contents of each entry are defined in Section 4.

                              initial values)


6.  Related Registries

   Numerous specifications have defined their own, independent
   registries for use of underscore names.  It is likely that adoption
   of the proposed, integrated registry should render these piecemeal
   registries obsolete

   Registries that are candidates for replacement include:

      Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label Registry

      Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Parameters

      Presence SRV Protocol Label Registry
