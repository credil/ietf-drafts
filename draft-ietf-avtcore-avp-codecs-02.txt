  Update to Recommended Codecs for the RTP Profile for Audio and Video
               Conferences with Minimal Control (RTP/AVP)
                    draft-ietf-avtcore-avp-codecs-02

Abstract

   The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control
   (RTP/AVP) is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure
   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for
   Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/
   AVPF), and the Extended Secure RTP Profile for RTCP-Based Feedback
   (RTP/SAVPF).  This document updates the RTP/AVP profile (and by
   extension, the profiles that build upon it) to reflect changes in
   audio codec usage since the document was originally published.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC3551] says that audio applications operating under the RTP/AVP
   profile SHOULD be able to send and receive PCMU and DVI4.  However,
   in practice, many RTP deployments do not support DVI4, and its
   utility is limited in the presence of much more modern codecs.  This
   document updates the recommended audio codec selection for the RTP/
   AVP profile to remove the SHOULD for DVI4.  By extension, this also
   updates the profiles which build on RTP/AVP, including RTP/SAVP
   [RFC3711], RTP/AVPF [RFC4585], and RTP/SAVPF [RFC5124].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Updates to RFC 3551

   The following text of [RFC3551] is hereby updated as set forth below
   in Section 3.1.

   Audio applications operating under this profile SHOULD, at a minimum,
   be able to send and/or receive payload types 0 (PCMU) and 5 (DVI4).
   This allows interoperability without format negotiation and ensures
   successful negotiation with a conference control protocol.

3.1.  Updates to Section 6

   In the final paragraph of Section 6, replace, "payload types 0 (PCMU)
   and 5 (DVI4)," with "payload type 0 (PCMU)."  Also, add a final
   sentence to this paragraph that states, "Some environments REQUIRE
   support for PCMU."  This results in the following paragraph:

   Audio applications operating under this profile SHOULD, at a minimum,
   be able to send and/or receive payload type 0 (PCMU).  This allows
   interoperability without format negotiation and ensures successful
   negotiation with a conference control protocol.  Some environments
   REQUIRE support for PCMU.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations for
   [RFC3551].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

6.  Acknowledgments
