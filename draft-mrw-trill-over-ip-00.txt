      Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) over IP
                     draft-mrw-trill-over-ip-00.txt

Abstract

   The Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol is
   implemented by devices called Routing Bridges (RBridges).  TRILL
   supports both point-to-point and multi-access links and is designed
   so that a variety of link protocols can be used between RBridge
   ports.  This document standardizes a methods for encapsulating TRILL
   in UDP/IP(v4 or v6).

1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   RBridges are devices that implement the IETF TRILL protocol [RFC6325]
   [RFC6326] [RFC6327].

   RBridges provide transparent forwarding of frames within an arbitrary
   network topology, using least cost paths for unicast traffic.  They
   support VLANs and multipathing of unicast and multi-destination
   traffic.  They use IS-IS link state routing and a hop count.  The are
   compatible with IEEE customer bridges, and can incrementally replace
   them.

   Two or more RBridges can communicate over a variety of different link
   types, such as Ethernet [RFC6325] or PPP [RFC6361].

   This document defines a method for RBridges to communicate over UPD/
   IP(v4 or v6).  TRILL over IP will allow remote, Internet-connected
   RBridges to form a single RBridge campus, or multiple TRILL over IP
   networks within a campus to be connected via a TRILL over IP
   backbone.

   TRILL over IP connects RBridge ports using IPv4 or IPv6 as a
   transport in such a way that the ports appear to TRILL to be
   connected by a single link.  The link will be a multi-access link if
   more than two RBridge ports are connected to a single TRILL over IP
   link.

   To support cases where RBridges are connected via links (such as the
   public Internet) that are not under the same administrative control
   as the TRILL campus, this document specifies the use of Datagram
   Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC4327] to secure communication
   between RBridges running TRILL over IP.


3.  Use Cases for TRILL over IP

   In this document, we consider two use cases that are typical of
   situations where network administrators may choose to use TRILL over
   an IP network: a remote office scenario, and an IP backbone scenario.

Internet-Draft                TRILL over IP                 October 2011


3.1.  Remote Office Scenario

   In the Remote Office Scenario, a remote TRILL network is connected to
   a TRILL campus across a multihop non-TRILL IP network, such as the
   public Internet.  The TRILL network in the remote office becomes a
   logical part of TRILL campus, and nodes in the remote office can be
   attached to the same VLANs as local campus nodes.  In many cases, a
   remote office may be attached to the TRILL campus by a single pair of
   RBridges, one on the campus end, and the other in the remote office.
   In this use case, the TRILL over IP link will often cross logical and
   physical IP networks that do not support TRILL, and are not under the
   same administrative control as the TRILL campus.

3.2.  IP Backbone Scenario

   In the IP Backbone Scenario, TRILL over IP is used to connect a
   number of TRILL networks within a single TRILL campus.  For example,
   a TRILL over IP backbone could be used to connect multiple TRILL
   networks on different floors of a large building, or to connect TRILL
   networks in separate buildings of a multi-building site.  In this use
   case, there may often be several TRILL RBridges on a single TRILL
   over IP link, and the the IP link(s) used by TRILL over IP are
   typically under the same administrative control as the rest of the
   TRILL campus.

3.3.  Important Properties of the  Scenarios

   There are a number of differences between the two scenarios listed
   above, some of which drive features of this specification.  These
   differences are especially pertinent to the security requirements of
   the solution, how multicast data frames are handled, and how the
   RBridges discover each other.

3.3.1.  Security Requirements

   In the IP Backbone Scenario, TRILL over IP is used between a number
   of RBridges, on a network link that is in the same administrative
   control as the remainder of the TRILL campus.  While it is desirable
   in this scenario to prevent the association of rogue RBridges, this
   can be accomplished using existing IS-IS security mechanisms.  There
   may be no need to protect the data traffic, beyond any protections
   that are already in place on the local network.

   In the Remote Office Scenario, TRILL over IP may run over a network
   that is not under the same administrative control as the TRILL
   network.  Nodes on the network may think that they are sending
   traffic locally, while that traffic is actually being sent, in a
   UDP/IP tunnel, over the public Internet.  It is necessary in this



Wasserman, et al.        Expires April 26, 2012                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                TRILL over IP                 October 2011


   scenario to protect user privacy, as well as ensuring that no
   unauthorized RBridges can gain access to the RBridge campus.  The
   data privacy requirement is addressed by the use of DTLS for both
   IS-IS frames and data frames between RBridges in this scenario.

3.3.2.  Multicast Handling

   In the IP Backbone scenario, native mutlicast may be supported on the
   TRILL over IP link.  If so, it will be used to send TRILL IS-IS and
   multicast data frames, as discussed later in this document.

   In the Remote Office Scenario, there will often be only one pair of
   RBridges connecting a given site, and even when multiple RBridges are
   used to connect a Remote Office to the TRILL campus, the intervening
   network may not provide reliable (or any) multicast connectivity.
   Also, there is no suitable way to provide data privacy for multicast
   traffic.  For all of these reasons, the connections between local and
   remote RBridges will be treated like point-to-point links, and all
   TRILL IS-IS control messages and multicast data frames that are
   transmitted between the Remote Office and the TRILL campus will be
   serialized, as discussed later in this document.

3.3.3.  RBridge Discovery

   In the IP Backbone Scenario, RBridges that use TRILL over IP will use
   the normal TRILL IS-IS Hello mechanisms to discover the existence of
   other RBridges on the link, and to establish authenticated
   communication with those RBridges.

   In the Remote Office Scenario, a DTLS session will need to be
   established between RBridges before TRILL IS-IS traffic can be
   exchanged, as discussed below.  In this case, one of the RBRidges
   will need to be configured to establish a DTLS session with the other
   RBridge.  This will typically be accomplished by configuring the
   RBridge at a Remote Office to initiate a DTLS session, and subsequent
   TRILL exchanges, with an TRILL over IP-enabled RBridge attached to
   the TRILL campus.


4.  TRILL Frame Formats

   To support the TRILL base protocol standard [RFC6325]. , two types of
   frames will be transmitted between RBridges: TRILL Data frames and
   TRILL IS-IS frames.







Wasserman, et al.        Expires April 26, 2012                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                TRILL over IP                 October 2011


4.1.  TRILL Data Frame

   The on-the-wire form of a TRILL Data frame in transit between two
   neighboring RBridges is as shown below:


      +--------------+----------+----------------+-----------+
      | TRILL Data   |  TRILL   |  Encapsulated  |   Link    |
      | Link Header  |  Header  |  Native Frame  |  Trailer  |
      +--------------+----------+----------------+-----------+


   Where the Encapsulated Native Frame is in Ethernet frame format with
   a VLAN tag but with no trailing Frame Check Sequence (FCS).

4.2.  TRILL IS-IS Frame

   TRILL IS-IS frames are formatted on-the-wire as follows:


      +--------------+---------------+-----------+
      | TRILL IS-IS  |  TRILL IS-IS  |   Link    |
      | Link Header  |    Payload    |  Trailer  |
      +--------------+---------------+-----------+


   The Link Header and Link Trailer in these formats depend on the
   specific link technology.  The Link Header usually contains one or
   more fields that distinguish TRILL Data from TRILL IS-IS.  For
   example, over Ethernet, the TRILL Data Link Header ends with the
   TRILL Ethertype while the TRILL IS-IS Link Header ends with the L2-
   IS-IS Ethertype; on the other hand, over PPP, there are no Ethertypes
   but PPP protocol code points are included that distinguish TRILL Data
   from TRILL IS-IS.

   In TRILL over IP, we will use UDP/IP (v4 or v6) as the link header,
   and the TRILL frame type will be determined based on the UDP port
   number.  In TRILL over IP, no Link Trailer is specified, although one
   may be added when TRILL over IP packets are encapsulated for
   transmission on a network (e.g.  Ethernet).


5.  Link Protocol Specifics

   TRILL Data packets can be unicast to a specific RBridge or multicast
   to all RBridges on the link.  TRILL IS-IS packets are always
   multicast to all other RBridge on the link.  On Ethernet links, the
   Ethernet multicast address All-RBridges is used for TRILL Data and



Wasserman, et al.        Expires April 26, 2012                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                TRILL over IP                 October 2011


   All-IS-IS-RBridges for TRILL IS-IS.

   To properly handle TRILL base protocol frames on a TRILL over IP
   link, either native multicast mode must be enabled on that link, or
   multicast must be simulated using serial unicast, as discussed below.

   In TRILL Hello PDUs used on TRILL IP links, the IP addresses of the
   connected IP ports are their SNPA addresses.  Thus, all TRILL
   Neighbor TLVs in such Hellos MUST specify that the size of the SNPA
   is 4-bytes for an IPv4 link or 16-bytes for an IPv6 link
   [rfc6326bis].  Note that SNPA addresses and their size are
   independent of TRILL System IDs which are 6-bytes.


6.  Port Configuration

   Each RBridge port that is to be used for a TRILL over IP link MUST
   have at least one IP (v4 or v6) address.  Implementations MAY allow a
   single physical port to operate as multiple IPv4 and/or IPv6 logical
   ports.

   TBD: MUST be able to configure list of IP addresses for serial
   unicast.  MUST be able to configure non-standard IP multi-cast
   addresses.


7.  TRILL over UDP/IP Format

   The general format of a TRILL over UDP/IP packet is shown below.


      +----------+--------+-----------------------+
      | IP       | UDP    |  TRILL                |
      | Header   | Header |  Payload              |
      +----------+--------+-----------------------+



8.  Handling Multicast

8.1.  Multicast of TRILL IS-IS Packets

8.2.  Multicast Data Frames


9.  Use of DTLS

   All RBridges that support TRILL over IP MUST implement DTLS and



Wasserman, et al.        Expires April 26, 2012                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                TRILL over IP                 October 2011


   support the use of DTLS to secure both TRILL IS-IS and data traffic.
   When DTLS is used to secure a TRILL over IP link, the DTLS session
   MUST be fully established before any TRILL IS-IS or data frames are
   exchanged.

   RBridges that implement TRILL over IP MUST support the use of
   certificates for DTLS authentication, and MUST support the following
   algorithm:

   o  TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA [RFC5246]

   RBridges that support TRILL over IP MAY support the use of pre-shared
   keys for DTLS authentication.  If pre-shared keys are supported, the
   following cryptographic algorithms MUST be supported for use with
   pre-shared keys:

   o  TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA [RFC5246]


10.  MTU Considerations

   TBD


11.  Middlebox Considerations

   TBD


12.  Security Considerations

   TRILL over IP is subject to all of the security considerations for
   the base TRILL protocol.  In addition, there are specific security
   requirements for different TRILL deployment scenarios, as discussed
   in the "Use Cases for TRILL over IP" section above.

   This document specifies that all RBridges that support TRILL over IP
   MUST implement DTLS, and makes it clear that it is both wise and good
   to use DTLS in all cases where a TRILL over IP link will traverse a
   network that is not under the same administrative control as the rest
   of the TRILL campus.  DTLS is necessary, in these cases to protect
   the privacy and integrity of data traffic.

   TRILL over IP is completely compatible with the use of IS-IS
   security, which can be used to authenticte RBridges before allowing
   them to join a TRILL campus.  This is sufficient to protect against
   rogue RBridges, but is not sufficient to protect data frames that may
   be sent, in UDP/IP tunnels, outside of the local network, or even



Wasserman, et al.        Expires April 26, 2012                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                TRILL over IP                 October 2011


   across the public Internet.  To protect the privacy and integrity of
   that traffic, use DTLS.

   In cases were DTLS is used, the use of IS-IS security may not be
   necessary, but there is nothing about this specification that would
   prevent using both DTLS and IS-IS security together.  In cases where
   both types of security are enabled, implementations MAY allow users
   to configure a single shared key that will be used for both
   mechanisms.


13.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated the following UDP Ports for the TRILL IS-IS and
   Data channels:


          UDP Port           Protocol

          (TBD)              TRILL IS-IS Channel
          (TBD)              TRILL Data Channel


   IANA has allocated one IPv4 and one IPv6 multicast address, as shown
   below, which correspond to the All-RBridges multicast MAC addresses
   that the IEEE Registration Authority has assigned for TRILL.

   [Values recommended to IANA:]


         TRILL name           IPv4              IPv6

         All-RBridges         233.252.14.0      FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:205


   Note: when these IPv4 and IPv6 multicast addresses are used and the
   resulting IP frame is sent over Ethernet, the usual IP derived MAC
   address is used.

   [Need to discuss scopes for IPv6 multicast (the "X" in the addresses)
   somewhere.  Default to "site" scope but MUST be configurable?]
