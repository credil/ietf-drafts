1.  Introduction

   In [I.D-ietf-nvo3-framework],one control component is defined to
   provide the capability for Address advertisement and tunnel mapping.
   In [I.D-fw-nvo3-server2vcenter],the control interface between NVE and
   interconnection functionality is defined to provide the capability:

   o  Enforce the network policy for each VM in the path from the NVE
      Edge associated with VM to the Tenant End System.

   o  Populate forwarding table in the path from the NVE Edge associated
      with VM to the Tenant End System in the data center.

   o  Populate mapping table in each NVE Edge that is in the virtual
      network across data centers under the control of the Director.

   However, there is no relevant work to discuss how those capability
   can be realized at the NVEs.  This document goes into details to
   discuss how to provide control plane and forward plane information to
   the NVE associated with the tenant system for enabling interconnect
   between Tenant Systems that belong to specific tenant network.

3.  Solution Overview

   This document addresses how to provide control plane and forward
   plane information to the NVE associated with the tenant system for
   enabling interconnect between Tenant Systems that belong to specific
   tenant network.

   Figure 1 shows the example architecture for interconnection between
   tenant systems.  This example architecture assumes that:

   o  One tenant system or a NVE may belong to one tenant VN or several
      tenant VNs, e.g., VMa and NVE Edge4 belong to both VN2 and VN3.

   o  If one tenant system belongs to multiple tenant VNs, it may
      connect to each tenant VN by being attached to one NVE or multiple
      NVEs,e.g., VM1 connect to VN1 by being attached to NVE Edge 1.

   o  One site may belong to one tenant VN or several tenant VN, e.g.,
      Site 2 belong to both VN2 and VN3.

   o  if one tenant system in one VN want to communicate with one tenant
      system in another VN, the interconnection functionality should get
      involved to setup tunnel between the interconnection functionality
      and the NVEs associated with the tenant system.

4.  Mapping tables at the NVE

   Every NVE pair( local NVE and remote NVE ) associated with the tenant
   system MUST maintain a mapping table entry for each currently
   attached tenant system.  Each mapping table entry conceptually
   contains the following fields:

   o  The tunnel interface identifier (tunnel-if-id) of the tunnel
      between the remote NVE and the local NVE where the tenant system
      is currently attached.  The tunnel interface identifier is
      acquired during the tunnel creation.

   o  The MAC address of the attached tenant end system.  This MAC
      address is obtained from auto-discovery protocol between Tenant
      System and its local NVE.

   o  The IP address of the attached tenant system.  This IP address is
      obtained from auto-discovery protocol between Tenant System and
      its local NVE.

   o  The IP address of the local NVE associated with the tenant system.

   o  The Identifier of VN context-VNID.  This Identifier is obtained
      from auto-discovery protocol between Tenant System and its local
      NVE.

5.  Key functions for signaling control/forwarding info to NVEs

5.1.  Create and Update tenant Virtual Network(VN)

   The tenant virtualization network(VN) is a collection of tenant
   systems, Network Virtualization Edges (NVE)(s) and end systems that
   are interconnected with each other.  The tenant VN also consists of a
   set of sites where each can send traffic directly to the other.

   In order to create or update a tenant VN, when a Tenant System is
   attached to a local NVE, the tenant system should inform the attached
   local NVE which VN the tenant system belong to.

   o  If the tenant system are the first participant in the VN through
      the local NVE, the tenant system and associated local NVE should
      be firstly added to the VN and the mapping table between the
      tenant system and the local NVE should be setup.

   o  If both the tenant system and the local NVE are not on the VN, the
      tenant system and associated local should be firstly added to the
      VN and then the mapping table associated with this tenant system
      should be setup at the local NVE and distributed to the other
      remote NVEs that belong to the same VN.

   o  If the local NVE is on the same tenant VN as the tenant system
      associated with the local NVE, only the tenant system needs to be
      added into the VN, i.e., the local NVE only needs to distribute
      mapping table to the other remote NVEs that belong to the same
      tenant VN.

   o  If the local NVE is not on the same tenant VN as the tenant system
      associated with that local NVE, the local NVE should firstly be
      added into the VN and then distributes the new mapping table to
      the other remote NVEs that belong to the same tenant VN.

   o  If one tenant system is the last participant connecting to the VN
      through local NVE, when this tenant system leave the VN, both the
      local NVE associated with this tenant system and mapping table
      associated with this tenant system should be removed from the VN.

5.2.  Associate the NVE and tenant system with VN context

   The VN context includes a set of configuration attributes defining
   access and tunnel policies and (L2 and/or L3) forwarding functions.
   When a Tenant System is attached to a local NVE, a VN network
   instance should be allocated to the local NVE.  The tenant system
   should be associated with the specific VN context using virtual
   Network Instance(VNI).  The tenant system should also inform the

Internet-Draft                   NVE2NVE                   February 2013


   attached local NVE which VN context the tenant system belong to.
   Therefore the VN context can be bound with the data path from the
   tenant system to the local NVE and the tunnel from local NVE
   associated with the tenant system and all the remote NVEs that belong
   to the same VN as the local NVE.  For the data path from the tenant
   system and the local NVE, the network policy can be installed on the
   underlying switched network and forwarding tables also can be
   populated to each network elements in the underlying network based on
   the specific VNI associated with the tenant system.  For the tunnel
   from local NVE to the remote NVEs, the traffic engineering
   information can be applied to each tunnel based on VNI associated
   with the tenant system.

5.3.  Populate mapping tables at the local NVE

   In some cases, two tenant systems may be attached to the same local
   NVE.  In order to allow the NVE to locally route traffic between two
   tenant systems that are attached to the same NVE, the mapping table
   that maps a final destination address to the proper tunnel should be
   populated at the local NVE.

   In some cases, two tenant systems may connect to the different VNs
   through the same interconnection functionality, in order to allow two
   tenant systems communication between two VNs, the mapping table that
   maps a final destination address to the proper tunnel should be
   populated in both NVE associated with two communicated tenant system
   and the interconnection functionality associated corresponding NVE.

5.4.  Distribute the mapping table to remote NVEs in the VN

   When the packet sent from one tenant system arrives at the ingress
   NVE associated with that tenant system, in order to determine which
   tunnel the packet needs to be sent to, the mapping table that maps a
   final destination address to the proper tunnel should also be
   distributed to all the remote NVEs in the VN using a control plane
   protocol or dynamic data plane learning.  The mapping table may be
   advertised directly to other remote NVEs that belong to the same VN
   or firstly advertised to the centralized controller that maintain
   global view of NVEs that belong to the same VN and then let the
   centralized controller distribute the mapping tables to all the
   relevant remote NVEs that belong to the same VN.

5.5.  The mapping table update at the NVE when VM moves or connection
      fails

   In some cases, one tenant system may be detached from one NVE and
   move to another NVE.  In such cases, the mapping table should be
   removed from the NVE to which the tenant system was previously

   attached and the new mapping table should be created at the new NVE
   to which the tenant system is currently attached.  Such mapping table
   should be updated at each remote NVE associated with the tenant
   system and the new NVE.

   In some cases, one tenant system may fail to connect to the VN
   through the NVE.  In such cases, the mapping table should be removed
   from the NVE to which the tenant system is currently attached.  In
   addition, the mapping table should be updated at each remote NVE in
   the same VN through which the tenant system is communicating with the
   destination tenant system.

5.6.  The VN context re-association at the NVE when VM moves

   In some cases, one tenant system may be detached from one NVE and
   move to another NVE.  In such cases, the VN context should be moved
   from the NVE to which the tenant system was previously attached to
   the new NVE to which the tenant system is currently attached.  In
   order to achieve this, the per tenant system VN context can be
   maintained at the centralized database and be retrieved at the new
   place based on the VN Identifier (VNID).
