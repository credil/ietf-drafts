           Bulk Binding Update Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6
               draft-ietf-netext-bulk-re-registration-10

Abstract

   For extending the lifetime of a mobility session, the Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 specification requires the mobile access gateway to send a Proxy
   Binding Update message to the local mobility anchor on a per-session
   basis.  In the absence of signaling semantics for performing
   operations with group specific scope, it results in significant
   amount of signaling traffic on a periodic basis between a given
   mobile access gateway and a local mobility anchor.  This document
   defines optimizations to the binding update and revocation operations
   in Proxy Mobile IPv6 for performing operations with group specific
   scope with the use of a group identifier.

1.  Introduction

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 base specification [RFC5213] requires the
   Mobile Node Identifier option to be present in the mobility signaling
   messages, such as in the Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement messages.  It essentially limits the operational
   scope of the binding update operation to a single mobility session.
   These signaling messages lack the capability to identify a group of
   mobility sessions, so the binding update and revocation related
   operations can be performed on all the mobility sessions that are
   part of that group.

   There is a need to have semantics for associating a group identity to
   a mobility session, so the scope of the binding update and revocation
   related operations can be extended to all the mobility sessions
   identified by the group identifier.  The group identifier therefore
   provides a considerably improved mechanism for protocol operations
   which would otherwise require multiple atomic transactions on a per
   mobility session basis.  Following are some of the use-cases where
   the group identifier can be used.

   o  For extending the lifetime of a mobility session, the mobile
      access gateway periodically sends a Proxy Binding Update message
      to the local mobility anchor on a per-session basis.  This process
      can be optimized by allowing the mobile access gateway to send a
      single Proxy Binding Update [RFC5213] message for a group of
      mobility sessions, identified by a group identifier.  The local
      mobility anchor upon accepting the request can update the lifetime
      of all the mobility sessions that are part of that group.

   o  A local mobility anchor, or a mobile access gateway service hosted
      on blade architecture system, on detecting a failure of a specific
      service card, can potentially request the peer to revoke all the
      sessions that are hosted on that service card, identified by a
      common group identifier.  Potentially, a single Binding Revocation
      Request [RFC5846] message carrying the group identifier can be
      used to revoke all the sessions hosted on that service card, which
      otherwise needs to be handled on a per-session basis.

   This document defines a new mobility option, Mobile Node Group
   Identifier option, and the extensions to binding update and binding
   revocation related procedures for performing binding operations with
   group specific scope.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications
   [RFC5213] and [RFC5844].  Additionally, this document uses the
   following abbreviations:

   Bulk Binding Update

      A binding update operation that has group specific scope.  A
      binding operation is associated with a specific mobility session.
      However, a Bulk binding update operation is associated with
      multiple mobility sessions.  This operation is not relevant for
      new mobility session creation.

   Bulk Binding Update Group

      A group of mobility sessions that are part of the same logical
      group and therefore share a common group identifier.  This group
      is the bulk binding update group.  This bulk binding update group
      is maintained by both the mobile access gateway and the local
      mobility anchor, and the grouping logic is local to that node.  A
      mobility session therefore can be identified by two bulk binding
      update group identifiers, one specific group created by the mobile
      access gateway and the other specific group created by the local
      mobility anchor.  The bulk binding update group identifiers are
      exchanged as part of the initial mobility session creation.  The
      mobility entities thereafter can perform binding update related
      operations such as lifetime extension and revocation operations on
      an entire bulk binding update group, identified by a group
      identifier.


3.  Bulk Binding Update Overview

3.1.  Motivation

   In a typical Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, a local mobility anchor serves
   multiple mobile access gateways and the capacity of that node with
   respect to the number of mobility sessions that it can host is quite
   high, typically in the order of few millions.  As the number of
   mobility sessions hosted by a local mobility anchor goes up, so is

   the amount of signaling traffic related to periodic binding update
   related traffic.

   The currently specified approach of binding update procedure for
   extending the lifetime, where the mobile access gateway is required
   to send a unique binding update message for each mobility session,
   even when there is no change to the session state is inefficient or
   sub-optimal.  These periodic binding update messages consume
   significant amount of network resources, both in terms of processing
   power and in terms of network bandwidth and at both the peers.  There
   is an opportunity to optimize the signaling procedures by allowing
   the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway to perform
   bulk binding update operations.  This document specifies extensions
   to Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling for performing binding update and
   revocation operations on a group of mobility sessions.  These
   extensions do not take away the existing functionality of performing
   binding operations on a single mobility session.

3.2.  General Operation

   The bulk binding update mechanism specified in this document allows
   the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor to perform
   binding update and revocation operations on a group of mobility
   sessions.  As part of the initial signaling during mobility session
   establishment, the local mobility anchor and the mobile access
   gateway exchange the respective bulk binding update group identifiers
   for that mobility session.  Subsequently both the peers can perform
   bulk operations on those groups by presenting the bulk binding update
   group identifier in the signaling messages.

   A mobile access gateway when sending a Proxy Binding Update message
   after detecting a new mobile node on its access link, can request the
   local mobility anchor to assign a bulk binding update group
   identifier for the mobile node's mobility session.  This is indicated
   by setting the (B) flag in the Proxy Binding Update to a value of
   (1).  The mobile access gateway will also assign a bulk binding
   update group identifier (or it may assign a default bulk binding
   update group - ALL-Sessions) and include that in the Mobile Node
   Group Identifier option.

   The local mobility anchor upon accepting the request will group the
   mobility session to a specific bulk binding update group (or it may
   assign it to the default bulk binding update group - ALL-Sessions)
   and return this bulk binding update group identifier in Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement message.  It will also set the (B) flag in the Proxy
   Binding Acknowledgement message to a value of (1).  The bulk binding
   update group identifier is carried in the Mobile Node Group
   Identifier option, described in Section 4.3.

   Once the bulk binding update group identifiers are exchanged, the
   local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway can perform
   binding operations on those entire groups, by including the bulk
   binding update group identifier in the signaling messages.  For
   example, the mobile access gateway can extend the lifetime of all the
   mobility sessions that are part of a group by sending a single Proxy
   Binding Update message with that bulk binding update group
   identifier.  Similarly, the local mobility anchor can revoke all the
   mobility sessions that are part of a group, by including that group
   identifier in the Proxy Binding Revocation message.

   Figure 1 explains the operational sequence of the bulk binding update
   and revocation operations on a group of mobile nodes, MN1, MN2 and
   MN3.

   o  (1) to (2): MAG detects the mobile node's (MN1) attachment to the
      access link.  The MAG groups the mobile node to a specific bulk
      binding update group, (M1).  The MAG notifies this group
      identifier to the LMA by including it in the Mobile Node Group
      Identifier option of the PBU message.

   o  (3): The LMA upon accepting the PBU, creates a mobility session
      and groups the mobility session to a specific bulk binding update
      group, (L1).  The LMA updates the mobile node's BCE entry to
      include the bulk binding update group identifier, (L1) and the
      bulk binding update group identifier presented by the MAG, (M1).
      The LMA also notifies the MAG about the bulk binding update group
      identifier (L1), by including it in the PBA.

   o  (4) to (5): The MAG upon receiving the PBA updates the BUL entry
      for that mobility session to include the bulk binding update group
      identifiers (L1) and (M1).  At this point, both the LMA and MAG
      are aware of the mobile node's bulk binding update group
      identifiers assigned by the peers.

   o  (6) to (9): The above steps (1 through 5) are repeated here for
      MN2 and MN3, details are omitted.  At the end of step (9), the MAG
      completes the signaling with the LMA.  The MAG assigns the mobile
      nodes, MN2 and MN3 to bulk binding update groups, M1 and M2
      respectively, while the LMA assigns them both to the same to the
      bulk binding update group, (L1).

   o  At this point, LMA has assigned MN1, MN2 and MN3 to the bulk
      binding update group of (L1), while the MAG has assigned MN1 and
      MN2 to the group (M1) and MN3 to group (M2).  Both the peers can
      now perform binding operations on a group of mobility sessions
      identified by the respective bulk binding update group identifier.

   o  (10) to (13): The MAG sends a periodic binding update message for
      extending the lifetime of all the mobility sessions that are part
      of the bulk binding update group, (M1).  It includes the bulk
      binding update group identifier, (M1) in the PBU.  The LMA upon
      accepting the PBU, extends the lifetime of both MN1 and MN2, which
      are part of the group (M1).

   o  (14) to (16): The LMA decides to revoke all the sessions that are
      part of bulk binding update group, L1.  The LMA sends a BRI
      message with the bulk binding update group identifier, (L1).  The
      MAG upon accepting the BRI message revokes all the MN1, MN2 and
      MN3 mobility sessions, which are part of that bulk binding update
      group, (L1).

   A new flag, Bulk-Binding-Update (B) flag is defined in the Proxy
   Binding Update message specified in [RFC5213].  The bit-value of
   Bulk-Binding-Update (B) flag in the flags field of the message will
   be (IANA-1).

   If the Bulk-Binding-Update flag (B) is set to a value of (1), it
   informs the local mobility anchor to enable bulk binding update
   support for the mobility session associated with this message.  If
   the (B) flag is set to a value of (0), the local mobility anchor MUST
   exclude the mobility session associated with this message, from any
   bulk binding related operations and any binding update, or binding
   revocation operations with bulk specific scope will not be relevant
   to that mobility session.

   This flag is relevant only for Proxy Mobile IPv6 and therefore MUST
   be set to value of (0), when the (P) flag is set to a value of (0).

   All other fields in the Proxy Binding Update message and the mobility
   options that can be carried in the message confirm to the respective
   specifications.

              Figure 3: Proxy Binding Acknowledgment Message

   A new flag, Bulk-Binding-Update (B) flag is defined in the Proxy
   Binding Acknowledgment message specified in [RFC5213].  The bit-value
   of Bulk-Binding-Update (B) flag in the flags field of the message is
   (IANA-2).

   If the Bulk-Binding-Update flag (B) is set to a value of (1), it
   serves as an indication to the mobile access gateway that the local
   mobility anchor has enabled bulk binding update support for the
   mobility session associated with this message.  The value of the flag
   MUST be set to the value of (0), if the value of the (B) flag in the
   Proxy Binding Update message that it received from the mobile access
   gateway was set to a value of (0).

   This flag is relevant only for Proxy Mobile IPv6 and therefore MUST
   be set to value of (0), when the (P) flag is set to a value of (0).

   All other fields in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message and the
   mobility options that can be carried in the message conform to the
   respective specifications.

4.3.  Mobile Node Group Identifier Option

   A new option, Mobile Node Group Identifier option is defined for
   using it in Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling messages exchanged between a
   local mobility anchor and a mobile access gateway.  This option is
   used for carrying the mobile node's group identifier.  There can be
   multiple instances of this option in a given signaling message,
   however, each of the instance SHOULD have a different sub-type value.
   This option is a generic option and this specification uses only the
   sub-type value of (1).

   Length
      This is an 8-bit unsigned integer indicating the length in octets
      of this option, excluding the type and length fields.  The value
      for this field MUST be set to a value of (6).

   Sub-type
      This 8-bit field identifies the specific mobile node's group type.
      This number space will be managed by the IANA.  The sub-type value
      of (1) is reserved for Bulk Binding Update Group.

   Reserved
      This 8-bit field is unused for now.  The value MUST be initialized
      to (0) by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Mobile Node Group Identifier   This 32-bit field contains the mobile
      node's group identifier.  The value of (0) is reserved and SHOULD
      NOT be used.  The value of (1) ALL-SESSIONS, is the default group
      of all mobility sessions established between a given local
      mobility anchor and a mobile access gateway.

4.4.  Status Codes

   This document defines the following new Status codes values for use
   in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message.  These values are to be
   allocated from the same numbering space, as defined in Section 6.1.8
   of [RFC6275].

   INVALID_MOBILE_NODE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER: (IANA-5)

5.  Protocol Considerations

5.1.  MAG Considerations

   The following considerations MUST be applied by the mobile access
   gateway when supporting this specification.

5.1.1.  Extensions to Binding Update List Entry Data Structure

   The conceptual Binding Update List entry data structure maintained by
   the mobile access gateway, described in Section 6.1 of [RFC5213],
   MUST be extended to include the following additional fields.

   o  MAG-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id - It is the bulk binding update
      group identifier assigned by this mobile access gateway for this
      mobility session.  This is a 32-bit unsigned integer.  This
      identifier is not globally unique within a Proxy Mobile IPv6
      domain, the same group identifier value may be used by other
      nodes.

   o  LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id - It is the bulk binding update
      group identifier assigned by the local mobility anchor for this
      mobility session.  This is a 32-bit unsigned integer.  This
      identifier is received in the Mobile Node Group Identifier option
      of the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message.  This identifier is
      not globally unique within a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, the same
      group identifier value may be used by other nodes.

5.1.2.  Requesting Bulk Binding Update Support for a Mobility Session

   The mobile access gateway MUST apply the following considerations for
   requesting bulk binding update support for a mobility session.

   o  When sending a Proxy Binding Update message to the local mobility
      anchor, the mobile access gateway MAY choose to request the local
      mobility anchor to enable bulk binding update support for the
      mobility session associated with that Proxy Binding Update
      request.  When making such request, the Bulk-Binding-Update flag
      (B) in the request MUST be set to a value of (1) and the Mobile
      Node Group Identifier option MUST be present.  The decision to
      request the bulk binding update support for a mobile node is a
      matter of local policy at the mobile access gateway and is
      controlled by the configuration variable,
      RequestBulkBindingUpdateSupportForMobilitySession.




Abinader, et al.          Expires July 13, 2012                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         Bulk Binding Update Support          January 2012


   o  The mobile access gateway MUST assign a bulk binding update group
      identifier for the mobility session.  Considerations on how the
      mobile access gateway assigns a group identifier to a mobility
      session is outside the scope of this document.  This group
      identifier can be unique to the service card on which the mobility
      session is hosted, or based on other grouping considerations.
      When there is no such group assignment is done, the mobile access
      gateway SHOULD assign the default group identifier value of (ALL-
      SESSIONS).  This assigned group identifier value MUST be present
      in the Mobile Node Group Identifier option and the the sub-type
      value in the option MUST be set to value of (1) (bulk binding
      update group).

   o  If the received Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message has the Bulk-
      Binding-Update flag (B) in the reply set to a value of (0), this
      is in response to a Proxy Binding Update request with the Bulk-
      Binding-Update flag (B) set to a value of (1), it is an indication
      that the local mobility anchor has denied the request for enabling
      bulk binding update support for that mobility session and that the
      mobility session is not associated with any bulk binding update
      group.  The mobile access gateway SHOULD set the bulk binding
      update group identifier values, LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id
      and MAG-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id values to (0), in the Binding
      Update List entry for that mobility session.  Furthermore, the
      mobility session should be excluded from any bulk binding update
      operations.

   o  If the received Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message has the
      status code value set to (0) (Proxy Binding Update accepted) and
      the Bulk-Binding-Update flag (B) in the reply is set to a value of
      (1), it is an indication that the local mobility anchor has
      accepted the request to allow bulk binding update support for that
      mobility session.  Furthermore, the Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option in the reply, with sub-type value of (1) (bulk binding
      update group), contains the bulk binding update group identifier
      for that mobility session assigned by the local mobility anchor.
      The mobile access gateway MUST update the LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-
      Group-Id and MAG-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id parameters in the
      Binding Update List entry for that mobility session.  However, if
      the received Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message has the Bulk-
      Binding-Update flag (B) set to a value of (1), but if the Mobile
      Node Group Identifier option is not present, the message MUST be
      considered as malformed and ignored.

   o  At any point of time, the mobile access gateway chooses to request
      the local mobility anchor to disable bulk binding update support
      for a mobility session, it MUST send a Proxy Binding Update
      message with the (B) flag set to a value of (0) and the Mobile

      Node Group Identifier option MUST NOT be present.  This message is
      sent as a normal binding update request for lifetime extension.
      Considerations from section 6.9.1 [RFC5213] MUST be applied.
      Furthermore, the mobile access gateway MUST update Binding Update
      List entry, by setting the bulk binding update group identifier
      values, LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id and MAG-Bulk-Binding-
      Update-Group-Id values to (0) and the mobility session MUST be
      excluded from any bulk binding update operations.

5.1.3.  Supporting Bulk Binding Updates

   The following section identifies the considerations for mobile access
   gateway for performing binding update and revocation operations with
   group specific scope.

   o  For extending the lifetime of all mobility sessions that share the
      same bulk binding update group identifier, the mobile access
      gateway MAY choose to send a Bulk binding update request.  For
      making such request, it can send a Proxy Binding Update message to
      the local mobility anchor, including the Mobile Node Group
      Identifier option with sub-type value of (1) (bulk binding update
      group), and with the Bulk-Binding-Update flag (B) set to a value
      of (0).  The identifier value in the option MUST be set to the
      bulk binding update group identifier of the group for which bulk
      binding update operation is being requested.  The message MUST NOT
      include any individual session identifiers such as, Mobile Node
      Identifier option [RFC4283], Home Network Prefix option [RFC5213],
      the IPv4 Home Address Request option [RFC5844], or the GRE Key
      option [RFC5845].  All the Considerations from section 5.3.3
      [RFC5213] MUST be followed when sending this request, with
      exception related to the use of Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option in place of the individual session identifiers.

   o  When requesting binding revocation for all the sessions that share
      the same bulk binding update group identifier, the mobile access
      gateway MAY choose to send a bulk revocation request.  For making
      such request, it can send a Binding Revocation Indication message
      [RFC5846] to the local mobility anchor, including the Mobile Node
      Group Identifier option, with sub-type value of (1) (bulk binding
      update group).  The identifier value in the option MUST be set to
      the bulk binding update group identifier of the group for which
      bulk binding update operation is being requested.  The message
      MUST NOT include any individual session identifiers such as,
      Mobile Node Identifier option [RFC4283], Home Network Prefix
      option [RFC5213], the IPv4 Home Address Request option [RFC5844]
      or the GRE Key option [RFC5845].  All the Considerations from
      section 9.2 [RFC5846] MUST be followed when sending this request,
      with exception related to the use of Mobile Node Group Identifier



Abinader, et al.          Expires July 13, 2012                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         Bulk Binding Update Support          January 2012


      option in place of the individual session identifiers.

   o  Any time the mobile access gateway receives a Binding Revocation
      Indication message [RFC5846], with a Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option present in the request and with sub-type value of (1) (bulk
      binding update group), the mobile access gateway MUST consider the
      request as a bulk revocation request, with the request scope for
      revoking of all the mobility sessions that are part of that bulk
      binding update group specific to that local mobility anchor, and
      identified by the group identifier in Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option.

   o  All the considerations from [RFC5846] apply when processing
      binding revocation request, except making the scope of the
      operation apply to a set of mobility sessions identified by the
      bulk binding update group identifier present in the request.

   o  If the received Binding Revocation Indication message includes a
      Mobile Node Identifier option [RFC4283], Home Network Prefix
      option [RFC5213], the IPv4 Home Address Request option [RFC5844],
      or the GRE Key Option [RFC5845], the mobile access gateway MUST
      consider this as an invalid message; it MUST reject the Binding
      Revocation Indication message and send a Binding Revocation
      Acknowledgement message with the Status field set to a value of
      128 (Binding Does NOT Exist).

5.2.  LMA Considerations

   For supporting this specification, the following considerations MUST
   be applied by the local mobility anchor when processing Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 signaling messages.

5.2.1.  Extensions to Binding Cache Entry Data Structure

   The conceptual Binding Cache entry data structure maintained by the
   local mobility anchor, described in Section 5.1 of [RFC5213], MUST be
   extended to include the following additional fields.

   o  MAG-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id - It is the bulk binding update
      group identifier assigned by the mobile access gateway for this
      mobility session.  This is a 32-bit unsigned integer.  This
      identifier is received in the Mobile Node Group Identifier option
      of the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message.  This identifier is
      not globally unique within a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, the same
      group identifier value may be used by other nodes.

   o  LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id - It is the bulk binding update
      group identifier assigned by this local mobility anchor for this



Abinader, et al.          Expires July 13, 2012                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft         Bulk Binding Update Support          January 2012


      mobility session.  This is a 32-bit unsigned integer.  This
      identifier is not globally unique within a Proxy Mobile IPv6
      domain, the same group identifier value may be used by other
      nodes.

5.2.2.  Enabling Bulk Binding Update Support for a Mobility Session

   The local mobility anchor MUST apply the following considerations
   when enabling bulk binding update support for a mobility session.

   o  The local mobility anchor will process a received Proxy Binding
      Update message as specified in [RFC5213].  However, if the (B)
      flag in the received Proxy Binding Update message is set to a
      value of (1) and if it includes a Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option with sub-type value of (1) (bulk binding update group), the
      local mobility anchor MUST apply the following additional
      considerations.

   o  If the (B) flag in the received Proxy Binding Update message is
      set to a value of (1) and with the Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option present in the request, the message serves as a request to
      the local mobility anchor to enable bulk binding update support
      for that mobility session.

   o  Upon successful processing and acceptance of the Proxy Binding
      Update, the local mobility anchor MAY choose to enable bulk
      binding update support for this mobility session.  The decision
      whether to enable bulk binding update support for that mobility
      session is a matter of local policy and is controlled by the
      configuration variable, AcceptBulkBindingUpdateReqMobilitySession.

   o  For enabling the bulk binding update support for the mobility
      session, the local mobility anchor MUST associate the mobility
      session to a specific bulk binding update group locally.  The
      specific details on how the local mobility anchor associates the
      given mobility session to a specific bulk binding update group is
      outside the scope of this document.  The local mobility anchor MAY
      choose to assign a default bulk binding update group identifier
      value of (ALL-SESSIONS), indicating that all the mobility sessions
      from that mobile access gateway are part of that group.  The local
      mobility anchor SHOULD update the bulk binding update group
      identifier values in the Binding Cache entry, LMA-Bulk-Binding-
      Update-Group-Id and MAG-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id to the
      respective values.

   o  If the bulk binding update support is enabled for the mobile
      node's mobility session, the local mobility anchor MUST send the
      assigned bulk binding update group identifier as part of the

      Mobile Node Group Identifier option, with sub-type value of (1)
      (bulk binding update group) in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment
      message that it sends to the mobile access gateway.  The (B) flag
      in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message MUST be set to value
      of (1).

   o  If the bulk binding update support is not enabled for the mobility
      session, the local mobility anchor MUST NOT include the Mobile
      Node Group Identifier option with a sub-type value of (1) (bulk
      binding update group), in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message
      that it sends to the mobile access gateway.  Furthermore, the (B)
      flag in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message MUST be set to
      value of (0).  It is to be noted that the Mobile Node Group
      Identifier option is a generic option and new sub-types may be
      defined by future specifications.

   o  If the received Proxy Binding Update message is not a bulk binding
      update request, (i.e., the (B) flag is set to a value of (0) and
      the Mobile Node Group Identifier option with sub-type value of (1)
      (bulk binding update group) is not present), but is a request for
      extending the lifetime of an existing mobility session, for which
      the bulk binding update support is already enabled, then the local
      mobility anchor MUST process the request as specified in
      [RFC5213].  However, the value of (0) in the (B) flag in the
      message serves as a request for the local mobility anchor to
      disable bulk binding update support for that mobility session.
      Upon accepting the request, the local mobility anchor SHOULD set
      the parameters, LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id and MAG-Bulk-
      Binding-Update-Group-Id in the Binding Cache entry to a value of
      (0) and the mobility session MUST be excluded from any bulk
      binding update operations.

   o  Any time the local mobility anchor detects that the mobile node
      has roamed and changed its point of attachment to a new mobile
      access gateway, it SHOULD also update the bulk binding update
      group identifier of the mobility session.  Additionally, it should
      also update the existing group identifiers associated with that
      session.  As part of sending the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment to
      the new mobile access gateway, it MUST include the updated group
      identifier in the Mobile Node Group identifier option, with a sub-
      type value of (1).  However, if the if the received Proxy Binding
      Update from the new mobile access gateway did not have the (B)
      flag set to a value of (1), then it MUST NOT include the mobility
      session in any of bulk binding update group and MUST NOT include
      the Mobile Node Group identifier option with the sub-type value of
      (1).

   o  Any time a mobile node's mobility session is de-registered by the
      mobile access gateway, or the session is revoked for
      administrative or any other reasons, the mobility session MUST
      also be removed from the bulk binding update group.

5.2.3.  Supporting Bulk Binding Updates

   The following section identifies the considerations for local
   mobility anchor for performing binding update and revocation
   operations with group specific scope.

   o  Any time the local mobility anchor receives a Proxy Binding Update
      message with the (B) flag in the request is set to a value of (0)
      and if a Mobile Node Group Identifier option present in the
      request and with sub-type value of (1) (bulk binding update
      group), the local mobility anchor MUST consider the request as a
      bulk binding update request, with the request scope for all the
      mobility sessions that are part of that bulk binding update group,
      specific to that mobile access gateway, and identified by the
      group identifier in Mobile Node Group Identifier option.  However,
      if the received request also includes any individual session
      identifiers such as, Mobile Node Identifier option [RFC4283], Home
      Network Prefix option [RFC5213], the IPv4 Home Address Request
      option [RFC5844], or the GRE Key option [RFC5845] the local
      mobility anchor MUST consider this as an invalid message; it MUST
      reject the Proxy Binding Update message and send a Proxy Binding
      Acknowledgement message with the Status field set to
      INVALID_MOBILE_NODE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER (Invalid group identifier
      value in the request).

   o  The local mobility anchor MUST consider the message as a request
      for extending the lifetime of all the mobility sessions that are
      associated to each of group identifier from the Mobile Node Group
      Identifier option.  However, if the Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option, with sub-type value of (1) (bulk binding update group),
      has an unknown group identifier, then the local mobility anchor
      MUST reject the Proxy Binding Update message and send a Proxy
      Binding Acknowledgement message with the Status field set to
      INVALID_MOBILE_NODE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER (Invalid group identifier
      value in the request).

   o  Upon accepting the bulk binding update request, the local mobility
      anchor SHOULD extend the lifetime for all the mobility sessions
      that are part of bulk binding update group identified by the group
      identifier in the Mobile Node Group Identifier in the message.
      Considerations from [RFC5213] MUST be applied for extending the
      lifetime of a mobile node's session.  It MUST also send a Proxy
      Binding Acknowledgment message with the Status field value set to

      0 (Proxy Binding Update accepted).  The lifetime field in the
      message MUST be set to the allocated lifetime for all the mobility
      sessions.  The message MUST also include the Mobile Node Group
      Identifier option, with sub-type value of (1) (bulk binding update
      group), with the identifier value copied from the Mobile Node
      Group Identifier option present in the received Proxy Binding
      Update message.

   o  If the local mobility anchor rejects the bulk binding update
      request for any administrative reason, then it MUST NOT update the
      lifetime in the binding cache entries of any of the mobile nodes
      identified by the group identifier.  The local mobility anchor
      SHOULD send a Proxy Binding Acknowledgment indicating the reason
      for the rejection in the status code.

   o  Any time the local mobility anchor receives a Binding Revocation
      Indication Message [RFC5846], with a Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option present in the request and with sub-type value of (1) (bulk
      binding update group), the local mobility anchor MUST consider the
      request as a bulk revocation request, with the request scope
      including all the mobility sessions that are part of that bulk
      binding update group, specific to that mobile access gateway, and
      identified by the group identifier in Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option.  However, if the received request also includes a Mobile
      Node Identifier option [RFC4283], Home Network Prefix option
      [RFC5213], the IPv4 Home Address Request option [RFC5844], or the
      GRE Key Option [RFC5845], the local mobility anchor MUST consider
      this as an invalid message; it MUST reject the Binding Revocation
      Indication message and send a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement
      message with the Status field set to a value of 128 (Binding Does
      NOT Exist).  All the considerations from [RFC5846] apply when
      processing binding revocation request, except making the scope of
      the operation apply to a set of mobility sessions identified by
      the group identifier present in the request.

   o  Upon accepting the Binding Revocation Indication request and
      completing the operation, the local mobility anchor MUST send a
      Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message with the Status field
      set to a value of 0 (success).  The message MUST include the
      Mobile Node Group Identifier option, with the identifier value
      copied from the Mobile Node Group Identifier option present in the
      received Binding Revocation Indication message.

Internet-Draft         Bulk Binding Update Support          January 2012


6.1.  Local Mobility Anchor - Configuration Variables

   The local mobility anchor MUST allow the following variables to be
   configured by the system management.  The configured values for these
   protocol variables MUST survive server reboots and service restarts.

   AcceptBulkBindingUpdateReqMobilitySession

      This flag indicates whether or not the local mobility anchor
      should accept the request from the mobile access gateway to enable
      bulk binding update support for the mobility session.  The default
      value for this flag is set to (1), indicating that it SHOULD
      accept the request from the mobile access gateway.  If the value
      of the flag is set to (0), the local mobility anchor MUST deny the
      request.

6.2.  Mobile Access Gateway - Configuration Variables

   The mobile access gateway MUST allow the following variables to be
   configured by the system management.  The configured values for these
   protocol variables MUST survive server reboots and service restarts.

   RequestBulkBindingUpdateSupportForMobilitySession

      This flag indicates whether or not the mobile access gateway
      should request the local mobility anchor to enable bulk binding
      update support for the mobility session.  The default value for
      this flag is set to (1), indicating that the the mobile access
      gateway MUST set the bulk binding update flag (B) in the Proxy
      Binding Update request to a value of (1).  If the flag is set to a
      value of (0), the mobile access gateway MUST set the bulk binding
      update flag (B) in the Proxy Binding Update to a value of (0).


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following five IANA actions.

   o  Action-1: This specification defines a new flag (B) to the Proxy
      Binding Update message, specified in [RFC5213].  This flag is
      described in Section 4.1.  The value of the flag (B) needs to be
      allocated from the Binding Update Flags registry.

   o  Action-2: This specification defines a new flag (B) to the Proxy
      Binding Acknowledgment message, specified in [RFC5213].  This flag
      is described in Section 4.2.  The value of the flag (B) needs to
      be allocated from the Binding Acknowledgment Flags registry.

   o  Action-3: This specification defines a new Mobility Header option,
      the Mobile Node Group Identifier option.  This option is described
      in Section 4.3.  The Type value for this option needs to be
      assigned from the same numbering space as allocated for the other
      mobility options [RFC6275].

   o  Action-4: The Sub-type field of the Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option introduces a new number space.  This number space needs to
      be managed by IANA, under the Registry, Mobile Node Group
      Identifier Type Registry.  This specification reserves the sub-
      type value of (1) (Bulk Binding Update Group).  Approval of new
      sub-type values are to be made through IANA Expert Review.

   o  Action-5: This document also defines a new status value
      INVALID_MOBILE_NODE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER (Invalid group identifier
      value in the request: IANA-5) for use in Proxy Binding
      Acknowledgement message, as described in Section 4.4.  This value
      is to be assigned from the same number space as allocated for
      other Status codes [RFC6275].  The allocated value has to be
      greater than 128.


8.  Security Considerations

   The Mobile Node Group Identifier option defined in this specification
   is for use in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   messages.  This option is carried like any other mobility header
   option and it does not require any other special security
   considerations.

   The bulk binding update and the bulk revocation operations specified
   in this document, perform operations on a group of mobility sessions.
   If proper authorization checks are not in place, a malicious node may
   be able to hijack a mobile node's mobility session or may carry out a
   denial- of-service attack.  To prevent this attack, this
   specification requires the local mobility anchor to allow only
   authorized mobile access gateways to perform bulk operations.
