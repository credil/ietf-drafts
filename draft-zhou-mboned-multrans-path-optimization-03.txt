    Multicast transition path optimization in IPv4 and IPv6 networks
            draft-zhou-mboned-multrans-path-optimization-03

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism to optimize the path between the
   multicast router and multicast source in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
   The basic idea is that when a multicast translation router has an
   IPv4 path and an IPv6 path to the same multicast data source, and
   both IPv4 and IPv6 joins are received, only one path is used.  One
   path is pruned, instead of the same traffic flowing over both v4 and
   v6 paths.  By adding a metric to the IPv4 path, the multicast
   translation router can determine which path to receive multicast
   data: IPv4 path, IPv6 path or both.  Therefore, an optimization path
   will typically be chosen when an identical v4/v6 traffic flow exists.

1.  Introduction

   It is common to use multi-access LANs such as Ethernet for
   transmitting multicast data in networks.  Section 3.6 of[RFC4601]
   describes Multi-Access Transit LANs.

   The PIM Assert message could be used when there are two identical
   multicast data flows (IPv4 and IPv6).  When duplicate data packets
   appear on the LAN from different routers, the routers notice this and
   then select a single forwarder.  This selection is performed using
   PIM Assert messages, which solve the problem in favor of the upstream
   router that has (S,G) state; Or, if neither or both router has (S,G)
   state, then the problem is solved in favor of the router with the
   best metric to the RP for RP trees, or the best metric to the source
   via source-specific trees.

   During IPv6 transition, it is common that there are many IPv4
   networks and IPv6 networks that connected to each other, which means
   that multiple multicast translation routers(MTR) exist at the edge of
   a network.  For robustness, reliability and load balance purpose, MTR
   function could be implemented in several nodes in the network.  MTR
   can be the mAFTR (Multicast AFTR ) mentioned in
   [draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast]. mAFTR can encapsulate IPv4
   multicast data in IPv6 tunnel.  MTR can also be the mXlate (Multicast
   Translator) as mentioned in [draft-lee-behave-v4v6-mcast-fwk]. mXlate
   can translate IPv4 multicast data to IPv6 multicast data.

   As a result, MTR (mXlate or mAFTR) will have more than one path to
   reach the RP or source S in IPv4 networks and IPv6 networks.  Or in
   other words, they will have two upstream routers: one is IPv6 router,
   and the other is IPv4 router.  MTR can reach the RP or source S by
   both paths.  Since MTR can receive both IPv4 and IPv6 (*,G) (or
   (S,G)) Join request, it needs to select a best path to RP or S in
   both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.  When it receives the two identical
   multicast data flows via IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces, MTR needs to send
   Prune Message to the worse path interface.  Figure 1 shows the
   scenario that MTR can reach source S through both IPv4 path and IPv6
   path.


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

      mXlate: A multicast translator mentioned in
      [draft-lee-behave-v4v6-mcast-fwk].

      mAFTR: A multicast Address Family Transition Router mentioned in
      [draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast].

      MTR: A multicast translation router, it can be mAFTR or mXlate.

      PIM-SM: Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode

      RP:Rendezvous Point


3.  Scenarios

   During the multicast transition from IPv4 to IPv6, there may be a
   router which receives IPv4 join (PIM or IGMP) on one interface, and
   an IPv6 join (PIM or MLD) on another interface (or it could even be
   the same interface).  The router should support IPv4 PIM and IPv6 PIM
   that is translation capable.  Assume these joins are for both IPv4
   (S4,G4) and IPv6 (S6,G6), and that there are active sources for both,
   sending basically the same content.  Either because there is a real
   source for both, or some upstream router is translating.  The router
   could then simply send upstream joins for both of these, and forward
   the traffic as needed without translation.

   However, if the router is aware that the same content comes from
   these two sources, it could select to join one of the streams, and
   translate as needed for the one downstream that wants a different
   protocol.  In this case, there will be a tradeoff between bandwidth
   on the upstream links, and the cost of translation (both on this
   device, and perhaps the quality of the stream).  When PIM Assert
   message is used to achieve this, the metrics for IPv4 and IPv6 should
   be comparable and all the PIM devices on the link should support PIM
   assert.

   Figure 1: MTR can reach IPv4 Source through IPv4 path and IPv6 path

   Figure 1 shows that MTR1 can access IPv4 Source through IPv4 path or
   IPv6 path.MTR1 has two upstream routers, one is IPv4 Router and the
   other is IPv6 Router.  MTR1 receives IPv4 (*,G) or (S,G) Join request
   from IPv4 network and IPv6 (*,G) or (S,G) Join request from IPv6
   network.  MTR1 can send Join request to RP or source S from interface
   connected to IPv4 Router or from interface connected to IPv6 Router.
   MTR1 may also send Join request from both upstream interfaces.  In
   this case, MTR1 need to select a best path to RP or S in both IPv4
   and IPv6 networks.  MTR1 sends Prune Message to the worse path, when
   it receives two identical multicast data flows in IPv4 and IPv6
   upstream interface.  MTR1 may receive two identical multicast data
   flows at the same time and stop interworking multicast data flow
   between IPv4 network and IPv6 network.

     IPv6 downstream          IPv6 downstream
     interface: Y             interface: B

   For simplification, we use two virtual Routers to replace MTR1
   Router.  Figure 2 shows that MTR1 can be taken as two virtual
   Routers.  The one on the left is a Virtual IPv4 Router, the one on
   the right is a Virtual IPv6 Router.  Virtual IPv4 Router has an IPv4
   upstream interface X and an IPv4 downstream interface Y. Virtual IPv6
   Router has an IPv6 upstream interface A and an IPv6 downstream
   interface B. The interface between two virtual Routers is V.

   When MTR receives two multicast data flows (one from IPv4 interface
   and the other from IPv6 interface), it compares two flows according
   to [draft-ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format] to confirm whether
   they are identical data flows.  If they are the same, select one or

   two.  When MTR Receives a IPv6 (S, G) or (*, G)Join, virtual IPv6
   Router selects an interface to send Join message.  The interface can
   be IPv6 upstream interface A or IPv4 upstream interface X (via
   interface V).

4.3.  Selecting interfaces to Source or RP

   The procedure to select an interface to S or RP is as below.

      1.Set the Metric value m1 for translation or encapsulation from
      IPv4 muticast to IPv6 multicast data.

      2.From interface A connecting IPv6 Router, MTR can get the metric
      m2 to reach S or RP by PIM assert message sent from IPv6 Router.

      3.From interface X connecting IPv4 Router, MTR can get the metric
      m3 to reach S or RP by PIM assert message from IPv4 Router.

      4.When MTR receives a IPv6 PIM Join message, virtual IPv6 Router
      compares m2 and m3+m1.  If m2>m3+m1, sending PIM Join message from
      IPv4 interface; If m2<m3+m1, sending PIM Join message from IPv6
      interface; If m2=m3+m1, MTR can choose interface X or A to send
      PIM Join message.

4.4.  Selecting a multicast data flow from upstream interface

   The procedure to select a multicast data flow from upstream interface
   is as below:

      1.MTR receives two identical mulitcast flows from IPv6 and IPv4
      Router.  The address formats of the two flows follows
      [draft-ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format].

      2.If virtual IPv6 Router receives multicast data from interface V,
      it will compare m2 and m3+m1 (the value is from last section).

      3.If m2>m3+m1, MTR will send PIM Prune Messages to IPv6 interface
      A; If m2<m3+m1 MTR will send PIM Prune Messages to interfaceX via
      virtual interface V. MTR will not translate multicast data from
      IPv4 to IPv6 or encapsulate IPv4 multicast data in IPv6 packets.
      If m2=m3+m1, MTR selects any interface to receive multicast data
      and sends PIM Prune Messages to the other interface.

4.5.  Requirements to the mulitcast Router

   The requirement to the edge PIM-SM Router includes:

Internet-Draft         Multrans path optimization          February 2013


      Edge PIM-SM Router needs to check multicast data flow from IPv4
      and IPv6 interfaces based on
      [draft-ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format] to determine
      whether they are the same multicast data flow.

      Edge PIM-SM Router sends PIM Assert messages via IPv4 and IPv6
      interfaces with different Metric value.

      Edge PIM-SM Router may stop translating/encapsulating IPv4
      multicast flow to IPv6 multicast flow or send Prune Messages to
      stop receiving IPv6/IPv4 multicast flow.
