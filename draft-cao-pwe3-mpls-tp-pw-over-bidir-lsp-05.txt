          LDP extensions for Pseudowire Binding to LSP Tunnels
            draft-cao-pwe3-mpls-tp-pw-over-bidir-lsp-05.txt

Abstract

   Many transport services require that user traffic, in the forms of
   Pseudowires (PW), to be delivered on a single co-routed bidirectional
   LSP or two LSPs that share the same routes.  In addition, the user
   traffic may traverse through multiple transport networks.

   This document specifies an optional extension in LDP that enable the
   binding between PWs and the underlying LSPs.

Internet-Draft  Binding PW to Bi-directional LSP Tunnels      March 2012


1.  Introduction

   Pseudo Wire (PW) Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) [RFC3985] is a
   mechanism to emulate a number of layer 2 services, such as
   Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Frame Relay or Ethernet.  Such
   services are emulated between two Attachment Circuits (ACs) and the
   PW encapsulated layer 2 service payload is carried through Packet
   Switching Network (PSN) tunnels between Provider Edges (PEs).  PWE3
   typically uses Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036] or
   Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) [RFC3209]
   LSPs as PSN tunnels.  The PEs select and bind the Pseudowires to PSN
   tunnels independently.  Today, there is no protocol-based
   provisioning mechanism to associate a PW with a specific PSN tunnel.

   The requirement for explicit control of PW-to-LSP mapping has been
   specified in Section 5.3.2 ( "Support for Explicit Control of PW-to-
   LSP Binding" ) of [RFC6373].  The following figure (Figure 1)
   illustrates a scenario that requires the explicit PW-to-LSP binding.


                      +------+                  +------+
            ---AC1 ---|..............PWs...............|---AC1---
            ---...----| PE1  |=======LSPs=======| PE2  |---...---
            ---ACn ---|      |-------Links------|      |---ACn---
                      +------+                  +------+

                 Figure 1: Explicit PW-to-LSP binding scenario


   There are two PEs (PE1 and PE2) connected through multiple parallel
   links that may be on different fibers.  Each link is managed and
   controlled as a bi-directional LSP.  At each PE, there are a large
   number of bi-directional user flows from multiple Ethernet
   interfaces.  Each user flow uses a PW to carry traffic on forwarding
   and reverse direction.  The operators need to make sure that the user
   flows (that is, the PW-pairs) to be carried on the same fiber (or,
   bidirectional LSP).

   There are a number of reasons behind this requirement.  First, due to
   delay and latency, traffic going over different fibers may require
   large amount of expensive buffer memory to compensate for the
   differential delay at the headend nodes.  Further, the operators may
   apply different protection mechanisms on different parts of the
   network.  As such, for optimal traffic management, traffic belongs to
   the same user should traverse over the same fiber.  In
   transportation, both forwarding and reserve direction PW's that
   belong to the same user flow need to be mapped to the same co-routed
   bi-directional LSP or two LSPs with the same route.

   applied.

         +-----+    |    |======|P3|==========|    |    +-----+
                    +----+      +--+ LSP2     +----+

          Figure 2: Inconsistent SS-PW to LSP binding scenario

   There are two bidirectional LSPs, LSP1 and LSP2, on diverse paths.
   The operator is to deliver a bi-directional flow between PE1 and PE2.
   Using the existing mechanisms, it's possible that PE1 may select LSP1
   (PE1-P1-P2-PE2) as the PSN tunnel for the PW from PE1 to PE2, while
   selecting LSP2 (PE1-P3-PE2) as the PSN tunnel for the PW from PE2 to
   PE1.

   Consequently, the bidirectional transport service is delivered over
   two disjoint LSPs, that may have completely different service
   attributes in terms of latency and protection.  This may not be
   acceptable as a reliable and effective transport service to the
   customers.

   The similar problems may also exist in multi-segment PWs (MS-PWs),
   where user traffic on a particular PW may hop over different networks
   on forward and reverse directions.

   One way to solve this problem is by introducing manual configuration
   at each PE to bind the PWs and the underlying PSN tunnels.  However,
   this is prone to configuration errors and does not scale.

   In this documentation, we will introduce an automatic solution by
   extending FEC 128/129 PW based on [RFC4447].


2.  LDP Extensions

   This document defines a new TLV, PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, to
   communicate tunnel/LSPs selection and binding requests between PEs at
   the PW setup time.  The TLV carries PW's binding profile and provides
   explicit and/or inexplicit information on the underlying PSN tunnels.

   The binding TLV is optional, and MUST NOT affect the existing PW

   operation when not present in the messages.

   The binding operation applies in both single-segment (SS) and multi-
   segment (MS) scenarios.

   The extension supports two types of binding requests:

   1.  Congruent binding: a requesting PE will suggest a underlying LSP
       to a remote PE.  On receive, the remote PE has the option to
       either using the suggested LSP, or choose another LSP that can
       deliver both forwarding and reverse direction traffic over the
       same route.

   2.  Strict binding: the requesting PE will choose and explicitly
       indicate the LSP information in the requests.

   In this document, the terminology of "tunnel" is identical to the "TE
   Tunnel" defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC3209], which is uniquely
   identified by a SESSION object that includes Tunnel end point
   address, Tunnel ID and Extended Tunnel ID.  The terminology "LSP" is
   identical to the "LSP tunnel" defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC3209],
   which is uniquely identified by the SESSION object together with
   SENDER_TEMPLATE (or FILTER_SPEC) object that consists of LSP ID and
   Tunnel end point address.

2.1.  PSN Tunnel Binding TLV

   PSN Tunnel Binding TLV is an optional TLV and MUST be carried in the
   LDP Label Mapping message if PW to LSP binding is required.  The
   format is as follows:


     0                   1                   2                   3

   octets of the entire TLV.

   The Flag field describes the binding requests, and has following
   format:


   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     MUST be Zero        |C|S|T|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Three flags have been defined at the present time.

   C (Congruent path) bit: This informs the remote T-PE/S-PEs about the
   properties of the underlying LSPs.  When set, the remote T-PE/S-PEs
   need to select LSPs with the same route (e.g., the same co-routed
   bidirectional LSP as the requesting PE selected).  If there is no
   satisfied tunnel, it may trigger the remote T-PE/S-PEs to establish a
   new LSP.

   S (Strict) bit: This instructs the PEs with respect to the handling
   of the underlying LSPs.  When set, the remote PE MUST use the tunnel/
   LSPs specified in the PSN Tunnel Sub-TLV as the PSN tunnel on the
   reverse direction of the PW, or the PW will fail to be established.

   T (Tunnel Representation) bit: This indicates the format of the LSP
   tunnels.  When the bit is set, the tunnel uses the tunnel information
   to identify itself, and the LSP Number fields in the PSN Tunnel sub-
   TLV (Section 2.1.1) MUST be set to zero.  Otherwise, both tunnel and
   LSP information of the PSN tunnel are required.  The default is set.

   C-bit and S-bit are mutually exclusive from each other, and cannot be
   set in the same message.

2.1.1.  PSN Tunnel Sub-TLV

   PSN Tunnel Sub-TLVs are designed for inclusion in the PSN Tunnel
   Binding TLV to specify the tunnel/LSPs to which a PW is required to
   bind.

   In this document two sub-TLVs are defined: the IPv4/IPv6 Tunnel sub-
   TLVs.  The format of the PSN Tunnel sub-TLVs is as follows:

   The definition of Source and Destination Global/Node IDs and Tunnel/
   LSP Numbers are derived from [RFC6370].  The notation is designed to
   describe co-routed or associated bi-directional LSPs.

   As defined in Section 4.6.1.2 and Section 4.6.2.2 of [RFC3209], the
   "Tunnel end point address" is mapped to Destination Node ID, and

Internet-Draft  Binding PW to Bi-directional LSP Tunnels      March 2012


   "Extended Tunnel ID" is mapped to Source Node ID.  Both IDs can be
   IPv6 addresses.

   A PSN Tunnel sub-TLV could be used to either identify a tunnel or a
   specific LSP.  The T-bit in the Flag field determines whether it
   stands for tunnel or LSP.

   When the T-bit is set, it identifies a tunnel, and the Source/
   Destination LSP Number fields MUST be set to zero and ignored during
   processing.  Otherwise, both Source/Destination LSP Number fields
   MUST have the actual LSP IDs of specific LSPs.

   Each PSN Tunnel Binding TLV can only have one such sub-TLV.


3.  Theory of Operation

   During PW setup, the PEs may select desired forwarding tunnels/LSPs,
   and inform the remote T-PE/S-PEs about the desired reverse tunnels/
   LSPs.

   Specifically, to set up a PW (or PW Segment), a PE may select a
   candidate LSP to act as the PSN tunnel.  If none is available or
   satisfies the constraints, the PE may trigger to establish a new
   tunnel/LSP.  The selected tunnel/LSP information is carried in the
   PSN Tunnel Binding TLV and sent with the Label Mapping message to the
   target PE.

   Upon the reception of the Label Mapping message, the receiving PE
   will process the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, determine whether it can
   accept the suggested tunnel/LSP or find the reverse tunnel/LSP that
   meets the request, and respond with a Label Mapping message, which
   contains the corresponding PSN Tunnel Binding TLV.

   It is possible that two PEs may request PSN binding to the same PW or
   PW segment over different tunnels/LSPs at the same time.  There may
   cause collisions of tunnel/LSPs selection as both PEs assume the
   active role.

   The PEs can be generally categorized into two types:

   1.  Active PE: the PE which initiates the selection of the tunnel/
       LSPs and informs the remote PE;

   2.  Passive PE: the PE which obeys the active PE's suggestion.

   Segmented PW has defined the active/passive role election (Section
   7.2.1, [RFC6073]).  This document will not define any new procedures.

Internet-Draft  Binding PW to Bi-directional LSP Tunnels      March 2012


   In the remaining of this document, it will elaborate the operation in
   two situations:

   1.  SS-PW: In this scenario, both PEs of a PW assume active roles

   2.  MS-PW: One PE is active, while the other is passive.  The PWs are
       setup using FEC 129


4.  PSN Binding Operation for SS-PW

   As illustrated in Figure-5, both PEs (say, PE1 and PE2) of a PW may
   independently initiate the setup.  To perform PSN binding, the Label
   Mapping messages MUST carry a PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, and the PSN
   Tunnel sub-TLV MUST contains the desired tunnel/LSPs of the sender.

          Figure 6: PSN binding operation in SS-PW environment


   As outlined previously, there are two types of binding request:
   congruent and strict.

   In strict binding, a PE (e.g., PE1) will mandate the other PE (e.g.,
   PE2) to use a specified tunnel/LSP (e.g.  LSP1) as the PSN tunnel on
   the reverse direction.  In the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, the S-bit MUST
   be set, the C-bit MUST be reset, and the Source and Destination IDs/
   Numbers MUST be filled.

   On receive, if the S-bit is set, other than following the processing
   procedure defined in Section 5.3.3 of [RFC4447], the receiving PE
   (i.e.  PE2) needs to determine whether to accept the indicated
   tunnel/LSP in PSN Tunnel Sub-TLV.

   If the receiving PE (PE2) is also an active PE, and may have
   initiated the PSN binding requests to the other PE (PE1), it MUST
   compare its own Node ID against the received Source Node ID.  If it
   is numerically lower, the PE (PE2) will reply a Label Mapping message
   to complete the PW setup and confirm the binding request.  The PSN
   Tunnel Binding TLV in the message MUST contain the same Source and
   Destination IDs/Numbers as in the received binding request, in the

   appropriate order.

   On the other hand, if the receiving PE (PE2) has a Node ID that is
   numerically higher than the Source Node ID carried in the PSN Tunnel
   Binding TLV, it MUST reply a Label Release message with status code
   set to "Reject to use the suggested tunnel/LSPs" and the received PSN
   Tunnel Binding TLV.

   To support congruent binding, the receiving PE can select the
   appropriated PSN tunnel/LSP for the reverse direction of the PW, so
   long as the forwarding and reverse PSNs have the same route.

   Initially, a PE (PE1) sends a Label Mapping message to the remote PE
   (PE2) with the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, with C-bit set, S-bit reset,
   and the appropriate Source and Destination IDs/Numbers.  In case of
   unidirectional LSPs, the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV may only contain the
   Source IDs/Numbers, the Destination IDs/Numbers are set to zero and
   left for PE2 to fill when responding the Label Mapping message.

   On receive, since PE2 is also an active PE, it needs to compare its
   own Node ID against the received Source Node ID.  If it's numerically
   lower, PE2 needs to find/establish a tunnel/LSP that meets the
   congruent constraint, and then reply a Label Mapping message with a
   PSN Binding TLV that contains the Source and Destination IDs/Numbers
   in the appropriate order.

   On the other hand, if the receiving PE (PE2) has a Node ID that is
   numerically higher than the Source Node ID carried in the PSN Tunnel
   Binding TLV, it MUST reply a Label Release message with status code
   set to "Reject to use the suggested tunnel/LSPs" and the received PSN
   Tunnel Binding TLV.

   In both strict and congruent bindings, if T-bit is set, the LSP
   Number field MUST be set to zero.  Otherwise, the field MUST contain
   the actual LSP number for the associated PSN LSP.

   After a PW established, the operators may choose to switch the PW
   from the current tunnel/LSPs.  Or, the underlying PSN is broken due
   to network failure.  In this scenario, a new Label Mapping message
   MUST be sent to update the changes.  Noting that when T-bit is set,
   the working LSP broken will not trigger to update the changes if
   there are protection LSPs.

   The message may carry a new PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, which contains
   the new Source and Destination Numbers/IDs.  The handling of the new
   message should be identical to what has been described in this
   section.

   However, if the new Label Binding message does not contain the PSN
   Tunnel Binding TLV, it declares the removal of any congruent/strict
   constraints.  The PEs may not map the PW to the underlying PSN on
   purpose, the current independent PW to PSN binding will be used.

   Further, as an implementation option, the PEs should not remove the
   traffic from an operational PW, until the completion of the
   underlying PSN tunnel/LSP changes.


5.  PSN Binding Operation for MS-PW

   MS-PW uses FEC 129 for PW setup.  We refer the operation to Figure-6.

         Figure 7: PSN binding operation in MS-PW environment


   When the active PE (T-PE1) starts to signal for a MS-PW, a PSN Tunnel
   Binding TLV MUST be carried in the Label Mapping message and sent to
   the adjacent S-PE (say S-PE1).  The PSN Tunnel Binding TLV includes
   the PSN Tunnel sub-TLV that carries the desired tunnel/LSP of
   T-PE1's.

   For strict binding, the initiating PE (T-PE1) MUST set the S-bit,
   reset the C-bit and indicates the binding tunnel/LSP to the next-hop
   S-PE (S-PE1).

   When S-PE1 receives the Label Mapping message, S-PE1 needs to
   determine if the signaling is for forward or reverse direction, as
   defined in Section 6.2.3 of [I-D.ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw].

   If the Label Mapping message is for forward direction, and S-PE1
   accepts the requested tunnel/LSPs from T-PE1, S-PE1 must save the
   tunnel/LSP information for reverse-direction processing later on.  If
   the PSN binding request is not acceptable, S-PE1 MUST reply a Label
   Release Message to the upstream PE (T-PE1) with Status Code set to
   "Reject to use the suggested tunnel/LSPs".

Internet-Draft  Binding PW to Bi-directional LSP Tunnels      March 2012


   Otherwise, S-PE1 relays the Label Mapping message to the next S-PE
   (S-PE2), with the PSN Tunnel sub-TLV carrying the information of the
   new PSN tunnel/LSPs selected by S-PE1 for the next PW segment.  S-PE2
   and subsequent S-PEs will repeat the same operation until the Label
   Mapping message reaches to the remote T-PE (T-PE2).

   If T-PE2 agrees with the requested tunnel/LSPs, it will reply a Label
   Mapping message to initiate to the binding process on the reverse
   direction.  The Label Mapping message contains the received PSN
   Tunnel Binding TLV for confirmation purposes.

   When its upstream S-PE (S-PE2) receives the Label Mapping message,
   the S-PE relays the Label Mapping message to its upstream adjacent
   S-PE (S-PE1), with the previously saved PSN tunnel/LSP information in
   the PSN Tunnel sub-TLV.  The same procedure will be applied on
   subsequent S-PEs, until the message reaches to T-PE1 to complete the
   PSN binding setup.

   During the binding process, if any PE does not agree to the requested
   tunnel/LSPs, it can send a Label Release Message to its upstream
   adjacent PE with Status Code set to "Reject to use the suggested
   tunnel/LSPs".

   For congruent binding, the initiating PE (T-PE1) MUST set the C-bit,
   reset the S-bit and indicates the suggested tunnel/LSP in PSN Tunnel
   sub-TLV to the next-hop S-PE (S-PE1).

   During the MS-PW setup, the PEs have the option to ignore the
   suggested tunnel/LSP, and select another tunnel/LSP for the segment
   PW between itself and its upstream PE on reverse direction only if
   the tunnel/LSP is congruent with the forwarding one.  Otherwise, the
   procedure is the same as the strict binding.

   The tunnel/LSPs may change after a MS-PW being established.  When a
   tunnel/LSP has changed, the PE that detects the change SHOULD select
   an alternative tunnel/LSP for temporary use while negotiating with
   other PEs following the procedure described in this section.


6.  Security Considerations

   The ability to control which LSP to carry traffic from a PW can be a
   potential security risk both for denial of service and traffic
   interception.  It is RECOMMENDED that PEs do not accept the use of
   LSPs identified in the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV unless the LSP end
   points match the PW or PW segment end points.  Furthermore, where
   security of the network is believed to be at risk, it is RECOMMENDED
   that PEs implement the LDP security mechanisms described in [RFC5036]

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  LDP TLV Types

   This document defines new TLV [Section 2.1 of this document] for
   inclusion in LDP Label Mapping message.  IANA is required to assign
   TLV type value to the new defined TLVs from LDP "TLV Type Name Space"
   registry.

7.1.1.  PSN Tunnel Sub-TLVs

   This document defines two sub-TLVs [Section 2.1.1 of this document]
   for PSN Tunnel Binding TLV.  IANA is required to create a new
   registry ("PSN Tunnel Sub-TLV Name Space") for PSN Tunnel sub-TLVs
   and to assign Sub-TLV type values to the following sub-TLVs.

   IPv4 PSN Tunnel sub-TLV - 0x01 (to be confirmed by IANA)

   IPv6 PSN Tunnel sub-TLV - 0x02 (to be confirmed by IANA)

7.2.  LDP Status Codes

   This document defines a new LDP status codes, IANA is required to
   assigned status codes to these new defined codes from LDP "STATUS
   CODE NAME SPACE" registry.

   "Reject to use the suggested tunnel/LSPs" - 0x0000003B (to be
   confirmed by IANA)
