1.  Introduction

   RSVP Cryptographic Authentication, defined in [RFC2747] and updated
   [RFC3097], defines the INTEGRITY object format to enable RSVP message
   integrity on a hop-by-hop basis.  It also specifies the MTI
   (mandatory to implement) algorithm, HMAC-MD5 [RFC2104].

   The integrity algorithm used is not indicated in the INTEGRITY object
   and is therefore either negotiated via another mechanism or manually
   configured.  Lacking a negotiation mechanism essentially means the
   algorithm is hard coded.  Hard coding algorithms once fashionable is
   no longer de riqueur.  Instead, protocols needs to support algorithm
   agility because cryptographic protocols weaken over time as
   cryptanalysis against them improves.  This document provides a
   cryptographically agile INTEGRITY object and it also provides
   rationale for the choices.

   Spoiler Alert: The change is to use the unused fields between the
   Flags and Key Identifier fields to indicate the integrity algorithm.

   This document does not change the authentication mechanism (i.e.,
   it's still HMAC-based authentication), but it does change the
   mandatory to implement algorithm.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   Familiarity with [RFC2747] is assumed.

3.  Design Methodology

   This section is informative.  It may or may not be removed in the
   final version.

   HMAC-MD5 may not yet be inappropriate to use [RFC6151], but RSVP
   needs to support algorithm agility in case HMAC-MD5 ever does become
   insecure.

   The solution proposed in s3.2 proposed to reuse the Class Number 4
   instead of defining another Class Number for an INTEGRITYv2 object. 
   In order to do this, the algorithm choice needs to be carried in the
   object itself.  Options exist:

     o Use one or more of the unused Flags fields.  A 7-bit fields would
       allow 127 additional algorithms to be specified, with 0
       indicating the existing algorithm.

     o Use the unused byte between the Flags and the Key Identifier. 
       This would allow an additional 255 algorithms to be specified.

     o Use a special value in one Key Identifier, Sequence Number of
       Keyed Message Digest and add another field.  This would allow an
       almost infinite number of algorithms to be specified.

   Luckily, there's no requirement to support an infinite number of
   algorithms and besides disrupting the order of the fields seems like
   too much of an implementation burden.

   Co-opting some of the unused bits seems best.  Flags seem more
   generic and it would be better to not take them all up.  Therefore,
   using the byte between the Flags and Key Identifier was chosen.

4.  Cryptographically Agile INTEGRITY Object

   The same INTEGRITY object type is used for both IPv4 and IPv6.

   The INTEGRITY object has the following format:

         Keyed Message Digest INTEGRITY Object: Class = 4, C-Type = 1

          +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
          |    Flags    |  Algorithm  |                           |
          +-------------+-------------+                           +
          |                    Key Identifier                     |
          +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
          |                    Sequence Number                    |
          |                                                       |
          +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
          |                                                       |
          +                                                       +
          |                                                       |
          +                  Keyed Message Digest                 |
          |                                                       |
          +                                                       +
          |                                                       |
          +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

   The Flags, Key Identifier, Sequence Number, and Keyed Message Digest
   fields are as defined in [RFC2747].

   Algorithm indicates the integrity algorithm used. 

5.  Mandatory to Implement Algorithm

   [RFC2747] mandates support for HMAC-MD5.  This document specifies the
   mandatory to implement algorithm as HMAC-SHA256 [RFC2104][SHS].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document establishes a new sub-registry to the RSVP Class Types
   4 C-Types 1 INTEGRITY registry for integrity algorithms.  The
   assignment policy is Specification Required [RFC5226].  The initial
   table is as follows:

   +----------+----------------+---------------------------+
   | Alg Flag | Algorithm Name | Keyed Digest Size (bytes) |
   +----------+----------------+---------------------------+
   |        0 | HMAC-MD5       | 16                        |
   +----------+----------------+---------------------------+
   |        1 | HMAC-SHA1      | 20                        |
   +----------+----------------+---------------------------+
   |        1 | HMAC-SHA224    | 28                        |
   +----------+----------------+---------------------------+
   |        3 | HMAC-SHA224    | 32                        |
   +----------+----------------+---------------------------+
   |        4 | HMAC-SHA384    | 48                        |
   +----------+----------------+---------------------------+
   |        5 | HMAC-SHA512    | 64                        |
   +----------+----------------+---------------------------+
