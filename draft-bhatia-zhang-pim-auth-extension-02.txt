Abstract

   Existing security mechanisms for the Protocol Independent Multicast -
   Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) routing protocol mandates to use IPsec to
   provide message authenticity and integrity.  This draft proposes an
   embedded authentication mechanism to facilitate data origin
   authentication and integrity verification for PIM packets in the
   cases where IPsec is not applied.

Internet-Draft      Authentication Extension for PIM           Sep. 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5796] describes the methods of using the IP security (IPsec)
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] or the Authentication
   Header (AH) [RFC4302] (which is optional) to protect the authenticity
   and integrity of the link-local messages of Protocol Independent
   Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)[RFC4601].  [RFC5796] mandates the
   application of manual key management mechanisms and provide optional
   support for an automated group key management mechanism.  However,
   the procedures for implementing automated group key management are
   left undone yet.

   It has been clarified in [I-D.bhatia-karp-pim-gap-analysis] that
   without the support of automated group key management mechanisms, the
   PIM packets protected by IPsec will be vulnerable to both inter-
   session and inner-session replay attacks.  In addition, the poor
   scalability of manual keying may cause deployment issues in many
   typical scenarios.  This document proposes a new type of PIM packet,
   called the Authentication Extension PIM packet (AEP), which is able
   to facilitate data origin authentication and message integrity
   verification for PIM packets without the support of IPsec.  An AEP
   actually contains all the essential information of a PIM packet being
   protected and provides cryptographic methods for the receiver to
   assess the authenticity and integrity of the packet.  In this
   solution, it is assumed that manual keying is performed while the
   automatic key management mechanisms are not precluded.  Within a
   packet proposed in this document, a monotonically increasing sequence
   number is adopted to address the replay attack issues.  However, the
   work of addressing the scalability issues imposed by manual keying is
   out of scope of this draft.

   Figure 1.  The format of an example AEP

   In compliance with [RFC4601], the first four fields of the AEP header
   is identical to those of the original types of PIM packets.
   Particularly, the PIM Version number is set to 2.  The type number of
   AEP is 9 in order to distinguish AEP from other types of PIM packets.
   The Reserved field is set to zero on transmission and ignored upon
   receipt.  The checksum field of the AEP is set to zero, and the
   checksum calculation and verification are omitted.

Internet-Draft      Authentication Extension for PIM           Sep. 2012


   Other fields of in the AEP header are described as follows:

      Key ID: A 16-bit field that identifies the secret key and the
      algorithm used to create the authentication data.

      Cryptographic Sequence Number: A 64-bit strictly increasing
      sequence number that is used to guard against replay attacks.  The
      64-bit sequence number MUST be incremented for every AEP packet
      sent by a PIM router.  Upon reception, the sequence number MUST be
      greater than the sequence number in the last AEP packet accepted
      from the PIM router sending the packet.  Otherwise, the AEP packet
      is considered a replayed packet and dropped.  PIM routers
      implementing this specification SHOULD use available mechanisms to
      preserve the sequence number's strictly increasing property for
      the deployed life of the PIM router (including cold restarts).
      Techniques such as sequence number space partitioning and non-
      volatile storage preservation can be used but are beyond the scope
      of this specification.

      Authentication Data: A field with a variable length.  The field
      carries the digest for the protocol packet and other optional
      information.

      Type 1: This 4-bit field indicate the type of the encapsulated PIM
      packet.

      Reserved 1: This 8-bit field is identical to the Reserved field of
      the encapsulated PIM packet.  Because the Version field and the
      Checksum field in the header of the encapsulated PIM packet are
      redundant, they are removed.


3.  PIM Security Association

   An PIM Security Association (SA) consists of a set of parameters for
   PIM routers to correctly generate or verify AEP packets.  In manual
   keying, it is the responsibility of network operators to generate and
   deploy PIM SAs amongst PIM routers appropriately to ensure the
   routers can exchange PIM signalling messages securely.

   The parameters associated with a PIM SA:

   o  Key Identifier (Key ID) : A 16-bit unsigned integer which is used
      to uniquely identify an PIM SA within a PIM domain.

   o  Authentication Algorithm: This parameter is used to indicate the
      authentication algorithm to be used with the PIM SA.  The value of
      this parameter can be implementer specific.  Currently, the

Internet-Draft      Authentication Extension for PIM           Sep. 2012


      following algorithms SHOULD be supported: HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-
      256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512.

   o  Key: The value of this parameter denotes the cryptographic key
      associated with the key ID.  The length of this key is determined
      by the algorithm specified in the PIM SA.

   o  Key Start Accept: The time after which a PIM router will accept a
      packet if it is created with this PIM SA.

   o  Key Start Generate: The time after which a PIM router will begin
      using this PIM SA for PIM packet generation.

   o  Key Stop Generate: The time after which a PIM router will stop
      using this PIM SA for PIM packet generation.

   o  Key Stop Accept: The time after which a PIM router will refuse to
      accept a packet if it is generated with this PIM SA.


4.  AEP Packet Processing

4.1.  Cryptographic Aspects

   In the algorithm description below, the following nomenclature, which
   is consistent with [FIPS-198], is used:

   H is the specific hashing algorithm (e.g.  SHA-256).

   K is the Authentication Key for the PIM security association.

   Ko is the cryptographic key used with the hash algorithm.

   B is the block size of H, measured in octets rather than bits.

   Note that B is the internal block size, not the hash size.

   For SHA-1 and SHA-256: B == 64

   For SHA-384 and SHA-512: B == 128

   L is the length of the hash, measured in octets rather than bits.

   XOR is the exclusive-or operation.

   Opad is the hexadecimal value 0x5c repeated B times.

   Ipad is the hexadecimal value 0x36 repeated B times.

Internet-Draft      Authentication Extension for PIM           Sep. 2012


   Apad is a value which is the same length as the hash output or
   message digest.  If the packet is transported upon IPv6, the first 16
   octets contain the IPv6 source address followed by the hexadecimal
   value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L-16)/4 times.  If the packet is
   transported upon IPv4, the first 4 octets contain the IPv4 source
   address followed by the hexadecimal value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L-4)/4
   times.

   1.  Preparation of the Key

      In this application, Ko is always L octets long.

      If the Authentication Key (K) is L octets long, then Ko is equal
      to K. If the Authentication Key (K) is more than L octets long,
      then Ko is set to H(K).  If the Authentication Key (K) is less
      than L octets long, then Ko is set to the Authentication Key (K)
      with zeros appended to the end of the Authentication Key (K) such
      that Ko is L octets long.

   2.  First Hash

      First, the AEP packet's Authentication Data field in the AEP
      header is filled with the value Apad.

      Then, a First-Hash, also known as the inner hash, is computed as
      follows:

      If the original packet is a Register packet

      First-Hash = H(Ko XOR Ipad || (AEP Packet-Data Part))

      else

      First-Hash = H(Ko XOR Ipad || (AEP Packet))

      The digest length for SHA-1 is 20 octets; for SHA-256, 32 octets;
      for SHA-384, 48 octets; and for SHA-512, 64 octets.

   3.  Second Hash

      Then a second hash, also known as the outer hash, is computed as
      follows:

      Second-Hash = H(Ko XOR Opad || First-Hash)

   4.  Result

Internet-Draft      Authentication Extension for PIM           Sep. 2012


      The resulting Second-Hash becomes the authentication data that is
      sent in the AEP header.  The length of the authentication data is
      always identical to the message digest size of the specific hash
      function H that is being used.

4.2.  Outbounding Packet Processing

   First of all, a sender needs to find a proper PIM SA and generate a
   PIM header.  The checksum field of the AEP header is set as zero.
   The length of the Authentication Data field is determined according
   the algorithm specified in the SA.  The sequence number for this SA
   is increased, and the new value is inserted into the Sequence Number
   field.  The Authentication Data field is set as Apad.  After these,
   the sender appends the encapsulated PIM packet (without the redundant
   fields) at the end of the AEP header and generates the authentication
   data as illustrated in Section 4.1.  After inserting the calculated
   authentication data into the Authentication Data field, the sender
   delivers the packet.

4.3.  Inbounding Packet Processing

   A router identifies a received PIM packet is an AEP by examining the
   Type field in PIM packet header.  If the cryptographic sequence
   number of the packet is less than or equal to the last sequence
   number received from the PIM router, the AEP packet MUST be dropped.
   If the Checksum fields in the AEP header and in the PIM header of the
   encapsulated PIM packet are not zero, the AEP packet MUST be dropped.

   According to the key ID in the packet header, the receiver tries to
   find the associated PIM SA.  If no valid PIM SA exists for this
   packet or the key is not in its valid period, the receiver MUST
   discard the packet.  If the appropriate PIM SA for the received
   packet is found, the receiver starts performing the authentication
   algorithm dependent processing, using the algorithm specified in the
   SA.

   In the first step, the receiver derives the cryptographic algorithm
   from the PIM SA and identify the length of the Authentication Data
   field.  Then the receiver fills the Authentication Data field with
   Apad .  After this, the receiver calculate the authentication data
   for the AEP as described in Section 4.1.  The calculated data is
   compared with the received authentication data in AEP header.  If the
   two do not match, the packet MUST be discarded.  In such a case, an
   error event SHOULD be logged.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Register Packet Processing

   The solution proposed in this draft only intends to secure PIM
   signaling packets.  The efforts of protecting data packets
   transported among PIM routers are out of scope.  Therefore, for a
   register packet, only the Type field, the B field, and the N field
   are secured while the Multicast data packet part is not protected by
   the authentication data.

5.2.  New Packet Type Versus Authentication Trailer

   Both PIM and OSPFv3 rely on IPsec to secure packet transmission, and
   they meet similar security issues, such as the vulnerability to the
   replay attacks and lack of support to priority packets.
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-auth-trailer-ospfv3] proposes an authentication
   trailer which is appended at the end of an OSPFv3 packet and provides
   IPsec independent authentication for the packet.  This idea can also
   be adopted into PIM.  However, compared with the OSPFv3 packet
   header, the PIM header lacks a field to point out the length the PIM
   packet.  The length of the PIM packet is actually indicated by the
   length of the IP payload and can be variable.  This raises a issue.
   If an authentication trailer is attached at the end of a PIM packet,
   it will be difficult to locate.  This issue can be addressed by
   extending the PIM headers with an Length field.

5.3.  Inter-Session Replay Attack Issue

   When a router is rebooted , the sequence number will be re-
   initialzed.  This will cause a problem.  When a PIM router received a
   hello message with a changed GenID and an re-inialized sequence
   number, it is difficult for the receiver to distinguish this message
   from a replay attack.  The soltuion proposed in this document is
   subject to this problem.  However, the experience in
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-security-extension-manual-keying] can be used to
   address this problem.  In the solution proposed in
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-security-extension-manual-keying], there is a reboot
   counter maintained in non-violate memory which is increased by 1
   after every reboot.  The count value is set into the first 32 bits of
   the sequence number.  Therefore, even after a restart, the sequence
   number will still be increased.
