INTERNET DRAFT               E-VPN Overlay             December 10, 2012


1  Introduction

   In the context of this document, a Network Virtualization Overlay
   (NVO) is a solution to address the requirements of a multi-tenant
   data center, especially one with virtualized hosts, e.g., Virtual
   Machines (VMs). The key requirements of such a solution, as described
   in [Problem-Statement], are:

   - Isolation of network traffic per tenant

   - Support for a large number of tenants (tens or hundreds of
   thousands)

   - Extending L2 connectivity among different VMs belonging to a given
   tenant segment (subnet) across different PODs within a data center or
   between different data centers

   - Allowing a given VM to move between different physical points of
   attachment to a given instance of L2 connectivity


   The underlay network for NVO solutions is assumed to provide IP
   connectivity between NVO endpoints (NVEs).

   This document describes how E-VPN can be used as an NVO solution and
   explores applicability of E-VPN functions and procedures.  In
   particular, it describes the various tunnel encapsulation options for
   E-VPN over IP, and their impact on the E-VPN control-plane and
   procedures for two main scenarios: 

   a) when the NVE resides in the hypervisor, and 
   b) when the NVE resides in a ToR device

   Note that the use of E-VPN as an NVO solution does not necessarily
   mandate that the BGP control-plane be running on the NVE. For such
   scenarios, it is still possible to leverage the E-VPN solution by
   using XMPP, or alternative mechanisms, to extend the control-plane to
   the NVE as discussed in [L3VPN-ENDSYSTEMS].

   The possible encapsulation options for E-VPN overlays that are
   analyzed in this document are:

   - VXLAN and NVGRE
   - MPLS over GRE

   Before getting into the description of the different encapsulation
   options for E-VPN over IP, it is important to highlight the E-VPN
   solution main features, how those features are currently supported,

INTERNET DRAFT               E-VPN Overlay             December 10, 2012


   and any impact that the encapsulation has on those features.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].

2 E-VPN Features

   E-VPN was originally designed to support the requirements detailed in
   [EVPN-REQ] and therefore has the following attributes which directly
   address control plane scaling and ease of deployment issues.

   1)  Control plane traffic is distributed with BGP and Broadcast and
   Multicast traffic is sent using a shared multicast tree or with
   ingress replication.

   2)  Control plane learning is used for MAC (and IP) addresses instead
   of data plane learning. The latter requires the flooding of unknown
   unicast and ARP frames; whereas, the former does not require any
   flooding.

   3) Route Reflector is used to reduce a full mesh of BGP sessions
   among PE devices to a single BGP session between a PE and the RR.
   Furthermore, RR hierarchy can be leveraged to scale the number BGP
   routes on the RR. 

   4)  Auto-discovery via BGP is used to discover PE devices
   participating in a given VPN, PE devices participating in a given
   redundancy group, tunnel encapsulation types, multicast tunnel type,
   multicast members, etc.

   5)  Active-active multihoming is used.  This allows a given customer
   device (CE) to have multiple links to multiple PEs, and traffic
   to/from that CE fully utilizes all of these links.  This set of links
   is termed an Ethernet Segment (ES).

   6)  Mass withdraw is used.  When a link between a CE and a PE fails,
   the PEs in all E-VPNs configured on that failed link are notified via
   the withdrawal of a single E-VPN route regardless of how many MAC
   addresses are located at the CE.

   7)  Route filtering and constrained route distribution are used to
   ensure that the control plane traffic for a given E-VPN is only
   distributed to the PEs in that E-VPN.

   8)  The internal identifier of a broadcast domain, the Ethernet Tag,

INTERNET DRAFT               E-VPN Overlay             December 10, 2012


   is a 32 bit number, which is mapped into whatever broadcast domain
   identifier, e.g., VLAN ID, is understood by the attaching CE device. 
   This means that when 802.1q interfaces are used, there are up to 4096
   distinct VLAN IDs for each attaching CE device in a given E-VPN.

   9)  VM Mobility mechanisms ensure that all PEs in a given E-VPN know
   the ES with which a given VM, as identified by its MAC and IP
   addresses, is currently associated.

   10)  Route Targets are used to allow the operator (or customer) to
   define a spectrum of logical network topologies including mesh, hub &
   spoke, and extranets (e.g., a VPN whose sites are owned by different
   enterprises), without the need for proprietary software or the aid of
   other virtual or physical devices.    

   11) Because the design goal for NVO is millions of instances per
   common physical infrastructure, the scaling properties of the control
   plane for NVO are extremely important.   E-VPN and the extensions
   described herein, are designed with this level of scalability in
   mind.


3 Encapsulation Options for E-VPN Overlays

3.1 VXLAN/NVGRE Encapsulation 

   Both VXLAN and NVGRE are examples of technologies that provide a data
   plane encapsulation which is used to transport a packet over the
   common physical infrastructure between NVEs, VXLAN Tunnel End Point
   (VTEPs) in VXLAN and Network Virtualization Endpoint (NVEs) in NVGRE.
   Both of these technologies include the identifier of the specific NVO
   instance, Virtual Network Identifier (VNI) in VXLAN and Virtual
   Subnet Identifier (VSID), NVGRE, in each packet.  

   Note that an E-VPN Instance (EVI) is equivalent to an NVO instance
   and that a Provider Edge (PE) is equivalent to a VTEP/NVE.

   [VXLAN] encapsulation is based on UDP, with an 8-byte header
   following the UDP header. VXLAN provides a 24-bit VNI, which
   typically provides a one-to-one mapping to the tenant VLAN ID, as
   described in [VXLAN]. In this scenario, the VTEP does not include an
   inner VLAN tag on frame encapsulation, and discards decapsulated
   frames with an inner VLAN tag. This mode of operation in [VXLAN] maps
   to VLAN Based Service in [E-VPN], where a tenant VLAN ID gets mapped
   to an Ethernet VPN instance (EVI). 

   [VXLAN] also provides an option of including an inner VLAN tag in the
   encapsulated frame, if explicitly configured at the VTEP. This mode

INTERNET DRAFT               E-VPN Overlay             December 10, 2012


   of operation maps to VLAN Bundle Service in [E-VPN], where the VLANs
   of a given tenant get mapped to an EVI.

   [NVGRE] encapsulation is based on [GRE] and it mandates the inclusion
   of the optional GRE Key field which carries the VSID. There is a one-
   to-one mapping between the VSID and the tenant VLAN ID, as described
   in [NVGRE] and the inclusion of an inner VLAN tag is prohibited. This
   mode of operation in [NVGRE] maps to VLAN Based Service in [E-VPN].
   In other words, [NVGRE] prohibits the application of VLAN Bundle
   Service in [E-VPN] and it only requires VLAN Based Service in [E-
   VPN].   

   As described in the next section there is no change to the encoding
   of E-VPN routes to support VXLAN or NVGRE encapsulation except for
   the use of BGP Encapsulation extended community. However, there is
   potential impact to the E-VPN procedures depending on where the NVE
   is located (i.e., in hypervisor or TOR) and whether multi-homing
   capabilities are required.

3.1.1  Constructing E-VPN BGP Routes

   In E-VPN an MPLS label distributed by the egress PE via the E-VPN
   control plane and placed in the MPLS header of a given packet by the
   ingress PE is used upon receipt of that packet by the egress PE to
   disposition that packet.  This is very similar to the use of the VNI
   or VSID by the egress VTEP or NVE, respectively, with the difference
   being that an MPLS label has local significance and is distributed by
   the E-VPN control plane, while a VNI or VSID has global significance.

   Although VNI or VSID are defined as 24-bit global value, there are
   scenarios in which it is desirable to use a locally significant value
   for VNI or VSID and in such such scenarios, MPLS label is advertised
   in E-VPN BGP routes and it is used in VXLAN or NVGRE encapsulation as
   a 20-bit value for VNI or VSID.  

   This memo specifies that when E-VPN is to be used with a VXLAN or
   NVGRE data plane and when a globally significant VNI or VSID is
   desirable, then Ethernet Tag field of E-VPN BGP routes (which is a 4-
   octet field) MUST be used and MPLS label field MUST be set to zero;
   however, when a locally significant VNI or VSID is desirable, then
   MPLS field of E-VPN BGP routes (which is a 3-octet field) MUST be
   used and Ethernet Tag field MUST be set to zero. 

   In order to indicate that a VXLAN or NVGRE data plane encapsulation
   rather than MPLS label stack encapsulation is to be used, the BGP
   Encapsulation extended community defined in [RFC5512] is included
   with E-VPN MAC Advertisement or Per EVI Ethernet AD routes advertised
   by an egress PE.  Two new values, one for VXLAN and one for NVGRE,
 


Sajassi-Drake et al.     Expires June 10, 2013                  [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT               E-VPN Overlay             December 10, 2012


   will be defined.  

3.2 MPLS over GRE 

   The E-VPN data-plane is modeled as an E-VPN MPLS client layer sitting
   over an MPLS PSN tunnel. Some of the E-VPN functions (split-horizon,
   aliasing and repair-path) are tied to the MPLS client layer. If MPLS
   over GRE encapsulation is used, then the E-VPN MPLS client layer can
   be carried over an IP PSN tunnel transparently. Therefore, there is
   no impact to the E-VPN procedures and associated data-plane
   operation.

   The existing standards for MPLS over GRE encapsulation as defined by
   [RFC4023] can be used for this purpose; however, when it is used in
   conjunction with E-VPN the key field MUST be present, and SHOULD be
   used to provide a 32-bit entropy field. The Checksum and Sequence
   Number fields are not needed and their corresponding C and S bits
   MUST be set to zero.


4  E-VPN with Multiple Data Plane Encapsulations

   The use of the BGP Encapsulation extended community allows each PE in
   a given E-VPN to know whether the other PEs in that E-VPN support
   MPLS label stack, VXLAN, and/or NVGRE data plane encapsulations.
   I.e., PEs in a given E-VPN may support multiple data plane
   encapsulations.

   If BGP Encapsulation Extended community is not present, then the
   default MPLS encapsulation (or statically configured encapsulation)
   is used. However, if this attribute is present, then an ingress PE
   can send a frame to an egress PE only if the set of encapsulations
   advertised by the egress PE in the subject MAC Advertisement or Per
   EVI Ethernet AD route, forms a non-empty intersection with the set of
   encapsulations supported by the ingress PE, and it is at the
   discretion of the ingress PE which encapsulation to choose from this
   intersection.

   An ingress node that uses shared multicast trees for sending
   broadcast or multicast frames MUST maintain distinct trees for each
   different encapsulation type.

   It is the responsibility of the operator of a given E-VPN to ensure
   that all of the PEs in that E-VPN support at least one common
   encapsulation. If this condition is violated, it could result in
   service disruption or failure.  The use of the BGP Encapsulation
   extended community provides a method to detect when this condition is
   violated but the actions to be taken are at the discretion of the

   operator and are outside the scope of this document.

5  NVE Residing in Hypervisor

   When a PE and its CEs are co-located in the same physical device,
   e.g., when the PE resides in a server and the CEs are its VMs, the
   links between them are virtual and they typically share fate;  i.e.,
   the subject CEs are typically not multi-homed or if they are multi-
   homed, the multi-homing is a purely local matter to the server
   hosting the VM, and need not be "visible" to any other PEs, and thus
   does not require any specific protocol mechanisms.  The most common
   case of this is when the NVE resides in the hypervisor.

   In the sub-sections that follow, we will discuss the impact on E-VPN
   procedures for the case when the NVE resides on the hypervisor and
   the VXLAN or NVGRE encapsulation is used.

5.1 Impact on E-VPN BGP Routes & Attributes for VXLAN/NVGRE
   Encapsulation

   As discussed above, both [NVGRE] and [VXLAN] do not require the
   tenant VLAN tag to be sent in BGP routes. Therefore, the 4-octet
   Ethernet Tag field in the E-VPN BGP routes can be used to represent
   the globally significant value for VXLAN VNI or  NVGRE VSID and MPLS
   field can be used to represent the locally significant value for VNI
   or VSID.  

   When the VXLAN VNI or NVGRE VSID is assumed to be a global value, one
   might question the need for the Route Distinguisher (RD) in the E-VPN
   routes. In the scenario where all data centers are under a single
   administrative domain, and there is a single global VNI/VSID space,
   the RD MAY be set to zero in the E-VPN routes. However, in the
   scenario where different groups of data centers are under different
   administrative domains, and these data centers are connected via one
   or more backbone core providers as described in [NOV3-Framework], the
   RD must be a unique value per EVI or per NVE as described in [E-VPN].
   In other words, whenever there is more than one administrative domain
   for global VNI or VSID, then a non-zero RD MUST be used, or whenever
   the VNI or VSID value have local significance, then a non-zero RD
   MUST be used. It is recommend to use a non-zero RD at all time.

   When the NVEs reside on the hypervisor, the E-VPN BGP routes and
   attributes associated with multi-homing are no longer required. This
   reduces the required routes and attributes to the following subset of
   five out of the set of eight :

   - MAC Advertisement Route 
   - Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route

   - MAC Mobility Extended Community
   - Default Gateway Extended Community

   As mentioned in section 3.1.1, BGP Encapsulation Extended Community
   attribute as defined in [RFC5512] SHOULD be used along with MAC
   Advertisement Route or Ethernet AD Route to indicate the supported
   encapsulations.


5.2 Impact on E-VPN Procedures for VXLAN/NVGRE Encapsulation

   When the NVEs reside on the hypervisors, the E-VPN procedures
   associated with multi-homing are no longer required. This limits the
   procedures on the NVE to the following subset of the E-VPN
   procedures:

   1. Local learning of MAC addresses received from the VMs per section
   10.1 of [E-VPN].

   2. Advertising locally learned MAC addresses in BGP using the MAC
   Advertisement routes.

   3. Performing remote learning using BGP per Section 10.2 of [E-VPN].

   4. Discovering other NVEs and constructing the multicast tunnels
   using the Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag routes.

   5. Handling MAC address mobility events per the procedures of Section
   16 in [E-VPN].


6  NVE Residing in ToR Switch

   In this section, we discuss the scenario where the NVEs reside in the
   Top of Rack (ToR) switches AND the servers (where VMs are residing)
   are multi-homed to these ToR switches. The multi-homing may operate
   in All-Active or Active/Standby redundancy mode. If the servers are
   single-homed to the ToR switches, then the scenario becomes similar
   to that where the NVE resides in the hypervisor, as discussed in
   Section 5, as far as the required E-VPN functionality.

   [E-VPN] defines a set of BGP routes, attributes and procedures to
   support multi-homing. We first describe these functions and
   procedures, then discuss which of these are impacted by the
   encapsulation (such as VXLAN or NVGRE) and what modifications are
   required.

6.1  E-VPN Multi-Homing Features

INTERNET DRAFT               E-VPN Overlay             December 10, 2012


   In this section, we will recap the multi-homing features of E-VPN to
   highlight the encapsulation dependencies. The section only describes
   the features and functions at a high-level. For more details, the
   reader is to refer to [E-VPN]. 

6.1.1 Multi-homed Ethernet Segment Auto-Discovery

   E-VPN NVEs (or PEs) connected to the same Ethernet Segment (e.g. the
   same server via LAG) can automatically discover each other with
   minimal to no configuration through the exchange of BGP routes.

6.1.2 Fast Convergence and Mass Withdraw

   E-VPN defines a mechanism to efficiently and quickly signal, to
   remote NVEs, the need to update their forwarding tables upon the
   occurrence of a failure in connectivity to an Ethernet segment (e.g.,
   a link or a port failure). This is done by having each NVE advertise
   an Ethernet A-D Route per Ethernet segment for each locally attached
   segment. Upon a failure in connectivity to the attached segment, the
   NVE withdraws the corresponding Ethernet A-D route. This triggers all
   NVEs that receive the withdrawal to update their next-hop adjacencies
   for all MAC addresses associated with the Ethernet segment in
   question. If no other NVE had advertised an Ethernet A-D route for
   the same segment, then the NVE that received the withdrawal simply
   invalidates the MAC entries for that segment. Otherwise, the NVE
   updates the next-hop adjacencies to point to the backup NVE(s).

6.1.3 Split-Horizon

   Consider a station that is multi-homed to two or more NVEs on an
   Ethernet segment ES1, with all-active redundancy. If the station
   sends a multicast, broadcast or unknown unicast packet to a
   particular NVE, say NE1, then NE1 will forward that packet to all or
   subset of the other NVEs in the E-VPN instance. In this case the
   NVEs, other than NE1, that the station is multi-homed to MUST drop
   the packet and not forward back to the station. This is referred to
   as "split horizon" filtering. 

6.1.4 Aliasing and Backup-Path

   In the case where a station is multi-homed to multiple NVEs, it is
   possible that only a single NVE learns a set of the MAC addresses
   associated with traffic transmitted by the station. This leads to a
   situation where remote NVEs receive MAC advertisement routes, for
   these addresses, from a single NVE even though multiple NVEs are
   connected to the multi-homed station. As a result, the remote NVEs
   are not able to effectively load-balance traffic among the NVEs
   connected to the multi-homed Ethernet segment. This could be the
 


Sajassi-Drake et al.     Expires June 10, 2013                 [Page 11]

INTERNET DRAFT               E-VPN Overlay             December 10, 2012


   case, for e.g. when the NVEs perform data-path learning on the
   access, and the load-balancing function on the station hashes traffic
   from a given source MAC address to a single NVE. Another scenario
   where this occurs is when the NVEs rely on control plane learning on
   the access (e.g. using ARP), since ARP traffic will be hashed to a
   single link in the LAG.

   To alleviate this issue, E-VPN introduces the concept of Aliasing.
   This refers to the ability of an NVE to signal that it has
   reachability to a given locally attached Ethernet segment, even when
   it has learnt no MAC addresses from that segment. The Ethernet A-D
   route per EVI is used to that end. Remote NVEs which receive MAC
   advertisement routes with non-zero ESI SHOULD consider the MAC
   address as reachable via all NVEs that advertise reachability to the
   relevant Segment using Ethernet A-D routes with the same ESI and with
   the Active-Standby flag reset.

   Backup-Path is a closely related function, albeit it applies to the
   case where the redundancy mode is Active/Standby. In this case, the
   NVE signals that it has reachability to a given locally attached
   Ethernet Segment using the Ethernet A-D route as well. Remote NVEs
   which receive the MAC advertisement routes, with non-zero ESI, SHOULD
   consider the MAC address as reachable via the advertising NVE.
   Furthermore, the remote NVEs SHOULD install a Backup-Path, for said
   MAC, to the NVE which had advertised reachability to the relevant
   Segment using an Ethernet A-D route with the same ESI and with the
   Active-Standby flag set.


6.1.5 DF Election

   Consider a station that is a host or a VM that is multi-homed
   directly to more than one NVE in an E-VPN on a given Ethernet
   segment. One or more Ethernet Tags may be configured on the Ethernet
   segment. In this scenario only one of the PEs, referred to as the
   Designated Forwarder (DF), is responsible for certain actions:

   - Sending multicast and broadcast traffic, on a given Ethernet Tag on
   a particular Ethernet segment, to the station.

   - Flooding unknown unicast traffic (i.e. traffic for which an NVE
   does not know the destination MAC address), on a given Ethernet Tag
   on a particular Ethernet segment to the station, if the environment
   requires flooding of unknown unicast traffic.

   This is required in order to prevent duplicate delivery of multi-
   destination frames to a multi-homed host or VM, in case of all-active
   redundancy.

6.2 Impact on E-VPN BGP Routes & Attributes 

   Since multi-homing is supported in this scenario, then the entire set
   of BGP routes and attributes defined in [E-VPN] are used. As
   discussed in Section 3.1, the VSID or VNI is encoded in the Ethernet
   Tag field of the routes if globally significant or in the MPLS label
   field if locally significant. 

   As mentioned in section 3.1.1, BGP Encapsulation Extended Community
   attribute as defined in [RFC5512] SHOULD be used along with MAC
   Advertisement Route or Ethernet AD Route to indicate the supported
   encapsulations.

6.3 Impact on E-VPN Procedures

   Two cases need to be examined here, depending on whether the NVEs are
   operating in Active/Standby or in All-Active redundancy.

   First, let's consider the case of Active/Standby redundancy, where
   the hosts are multi-homed to a set of NVEs, however, only a single
   NVE is active at a given point of time for a given VNI or VSID. In
   this case, the Split-Horizon and Aliasing functions are not required
   but other functions such as multi-homed Ethernet segment auto-
   discovery, fast convergence and mass withdraw, repair path, and DF
   election are required. In this case, the impact of the use of the
   VXLAN/NVGRE encapsulation on the E-VPN procedures is when the Backup-
   Path function is supported, as discussed next:

   In E-VPN, the NVEs connected to a multi-homed site using
   Active/Standby redundancy optionally advertise a VPN label, in the
   Ethernet A-D Route per EVI, used to send traffic to the backup NVE in
   the case where the primary NVE fails. In the case where VXLAN or
   NVGRE encapsulation is used, some alternative means that does not
   rely on MPLS labels is required to support Backup-Path. This is
   discussed in Section 4.3.2 below. If the Backup-Path function is not
   used, then the VXLAN/NVGRE encapsulation would have no impact on the
   E-VPN procedures.

   Second, let's consider the case of All-Active redundancy. In this
   case, out of the E-VPN multi-homing features listed in section 4.1,
   the use of the VXLAN or NVGRE encapsulation impacts the Split-Horizon
   and Aliasing features, since those two rely on the MPLS client layer.
   Given that this MPLS client layer is absent with these types of
   encapsulations, alternative procedures and mechanisms are needed to
   provide the required functions. Those are discussed in detail next.

6.3.1 Split Horizon

 


Sajassi-Drake et al.     Expires June 10, 2013                 [Page 13]

INTERNET DRAFT               E-VPN Overlay             December 10, 2012


   In E-VPN, an MPLS label is used for split-horizon filtering to
   support active/active multi-homing where an ingress ToR switch adds a
   label corresponding to the site of origin (aka ESI MPLS Label) when
   encapsulating the packet. The egress ToR switch checks the ESI MPLS
   label when attempting to forward a multi-destination frame out an
   interface, and if the label corresponds to the same site identifier
   (ESI) associated with that interface, the packet gets dropped. This
   prevents the occurrence of forwarding loops. 

   Since the VXLAN or NVGRE encapsulation does not include this ESI MPLS
   label, other means of performing the split-horizon filtering function
   MUST be devised. The following approach is recommended for split-
   horizon filtering when VXLAN or NVGRE encapsulation is used.

   Every NVE track the IP address(es) associated with the other NVE(s)
   with which it has shared multi-homed Ethernet Segments. When the NVE
   receives a multi-destination frame from the overlay network, it
   examines the source IP address in the tunnel header (which
   corresponds to the ingress NVE) and filters out the frame on all
   local interfaces connected to Ethernet Segments that are shared with
   the ingress NVE. With this approach, it is required that the ingress
   NVE performs replication locally to all directly attached Ethernet
   Segments (regardless of the DF Election state) for all flooded
   traffic ingress from the access interfaces (i.e. from the hosts).
   This approach is referred to as "Local Bias", and has the advantage
   that only a single IP address needs to be used per NVE for split-
   horizon filtering, as opposed to requiring an IP address per Ethernet
   Segment per NVE. 

   In order to prevent unhealthy interactions between the split horizon
   procedures defined in [E-VPN] and the local bias procedures described
   in this memo, a mix of MPLS over GRE encapsulations on the one hand
   and VXLAN/NVGRE encapsulations on the other on a given Ethernet
   Segment is prohibited. The use of the BGP Encapsulation extended
   community provides a method to detect when this condition is violated
   but the actions to be taken are at the discretion of the operator and
   are outside the scope of this document.

6.3.2 Aliasing and Backup-Path

   The Aliasing and the Backup-Path procedures for VXLAN/NVGRE
   encapsulation is very similar to the ones for MPLS. In case of MPLS,
   two different Ethernet AD routes are used for this purpose. The one
   used for Aliasing has a VPN scope and carries a VPN label but the one
   used for Backup-Path has Ethernet segment scope and doesn't carry any
   VPN specific info (e.g., Ethernet Tag and MPLS label are set to
   zero). The same two routes are used when VXLAN or NVGRE encapsulation
   is used with the difference that when Ethernet AD route is used for
 


Sajassi-Drake et al.     Expires June 10, 2013                 [Page 14]

INTERNET DRAFT               E-VPN Overlay             December 10, 2012


   Aliasing with VPN scope, the Ethernet Tag field is set to VNI or VSID
   to indicate VPN scope (and MPLS field may be set to a VPN label if
   needed).

7 Support for Multicast

   The E-VPN Inclusive Multicast BGP route is used to discover the
   multicast tunnels among the endpoints associated with a given VXLAN
   VNI or NVGRE VSID. The Ethernet Tag field of this route is used to
   encode the VNI or VSID. This route is tagged with the PMSI Tunnel
   attribute, which is used to encode the type of multicast tunnel to be
   used as well as the multicast tunnel identifier. The following tunnel
   types can be used for VXLAN/NVGRE:

   - PIM-SSM Tree
   - PIM-SM Tree
   - BIDIR-PIM Tree
   - Ingress Replication

   Except for Ingress Replication, this multicast tunnel is used by the
   PE originating the route for sending multicast traffic to other PEs,
   and is used by PEs that receive this route for receiving the traffic
   originated by CEs connected to the PE that originated the route.

   In the scenario where the multicast tunnel is a tree, both the
   Inclusive as well as the Aggregate Inclusive variants may be used. In
   the former case, a multicast tree is dedicated to a VNI or VSID.
   Whereas, in the latter, a multicast tree is shared among multiple
   VNIs or VSIDs. This is done by having the NVEs advertise multiple
   Inclusive Multicast routes with different VNI or VSID encoded in the
   Ethernet Tag field, but with the same tunnel identifier encoded in
   the PMSI Tunnel attribute.


8 Inter-AS 

   For inter-AS operation, two scenarios must be considered:

   - Scenario 1: The tunnel endpoint IP addresses are public
   - Scenario 2: The tunnel endpoint IP addresses are private

   In the first scenario, inter-AS operation is straight-forward and
   follows existing BGP inter-AS procedures. 

   The second scenario is more challenging, because the absence of the
   MPLS client layer from the VXLAN encapsulation creates a situation
   where the ASBR has no fully qualified indication within the tunnel
   header as to where the tunnel endpoint resides. To elaborate on this,
 


Sajassi-Drake et al.     Expires June 10, 2013                 [Page 15]

INTERNET DRAFT               E-VPN Overlay             December 10, 2012


   recall that with MPLS, the client layer labels (i.e. the VPN labels)
   are downstream assigned. As such, this label implicitly has a
   connotation of the tunnel endpoint, and it is sufficient for the ASBR
   to look up the client layer label in order to identify the label
   translation required as well as the tunnel endpoint to which a given
   packet is being destined. With the VXLAN encapsulation, the VNI is
   globally assigned and hence is shared among all endpoints. The
   destination IP address is the only field which identifies the tunnel
   endpoint in the tunnel header, and this address is privately managed
   by every data center network. Since the tunnel address is allocated
   out of a private address pool, then we either need to do a lookup
   based on VTEP IP address in context of a VRF (e.g., use IP-VPN) or
   terminate the VXLAN tunnel and do a lookup based on the tenant's MAC
   address to identify the egress tunnel on the ASBR. This effectively
   mandates that the ASBR to either run another overlay solution such as
   IP-VPN over MPLS/IP core network or to be aware of the MAC addresses
   of all VMs in its local AS, at the very least.

   If VNIs/VSIDs have local significance, then the inter-AS operation
   can be simplified to that of MPLS and thus MPLS inter-AS option B and
   C can be leveraged in here.  This subject will be further expanded in
   the future revision. 

   Even in the first scenario where the tunnel endpoint IP addresses are
   public, there may be security concern regarding the distribution of
   these addresses among different ASes. This security concern is one of
   the main reasons for having the so called inter-AS "option-B" in MPLS
   VPN solutions such as E-VPN.

11  Security Considerations

   This document uses IP-based tunnel technologies to support data 
   plane transport.  Consequently, the security considerations of those
   tunnel technologies apply.  This document defines support for [VXLAN]
   and [NVGRE]. The security considerations from those documents as well
   as [RFC4301] apply to the data plane aspects of this document.

   As with [RFC5512], any modification of the information that is used
   to form encapsulation headers, to choose a tunnel type, or to choose
   a particular tunnel for a particular payload type may lead to user
   data packets getting misrouted, misdelivered, and/or dropped.

INTERNET DRAFT               E-VPN Overlay             December 10, 2012


   More broadly, the security considerations for the transport of IP
   reachability information using BGP are discussed in [RFC4271] and
   [RFC4272], and are equally applicable for the extensions described 
   in this document.

   If the integrity of the BGP session is not itself protected, then an
   imposter could mount a denial-of-service attack by establishing
   numerous BGP sessions and forcing an IPsec SA to be created for each
   one.  However, as such an imposter could wreak havoc on the entire
   routing system, this particular sort of attack is probably not of 
   any special importance.

   It should be noted that a BGP session may itself be transported over
   an IPsec tunnel.  Such IPsec tunnels can provide additional security
   to a BGP session.  The management of such IPsec tunnels is outside
   the scope of this document.
