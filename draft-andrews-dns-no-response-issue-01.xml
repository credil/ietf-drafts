	The DNS is a query / response protocol.  Failure to respond to
	queries causes both immediate operational problems and long term
	problems with protocol development.
      </t>
      <t>
	This document will identify a number of common classes of
	queries that some servers fail to respond too.  This document
	will also suggest procedures for TLD and other similar zone
	operators to apply to reduce / eliminate the problem.

      <t>
	The DNS <xref target="RFC1034"/>, <xref target="RFC1035"/>
	is a query / response protocol.  Failure to respond to
	queries causes both immediate operational problems and long
	term problems with protocol development.
      </t>
      <t>
	Failure to respond to a query is indistinguishable from a
	packet loss without doing a analysis of query response
	patterns and results in unnecessary additional queries being
	made by DNS clients and unnecessary delays being introduced
	to the resolution process.
      </t>
      <t>
	Due to the inability to distingish between packet loss and
	nameservers dropping EDNS queries, packet loss is sometimes
	misclassified as lack of EDNS support which can lead to
	DNSSEC validation failures.
      </t>
      <t>
	Allowing servers which fail to respond to queries to remain
	in the DNS hierarchy for extended periods results in
	developers being afraid to deploy new type codes.  Such servers
	need to be identified and corrected / replaced.
      </t>
      <t>
	The DNS has response codes that cover almost any conceivable
	query response.  A nameserver should be able to respond to
	any conceivable query using them.
      </t>
      <t>
	Unless a nameserver is under attack, it should respond to
	all queries directed to it as a result of following
	delegations.  Additionally code should not assume that there
	isn't a delegation to the server even if it is not configured
	to serve the zone.  Broken delegation are a common occurrence
	in the DNS and receiving queries for zones that you are not
	configured for is not a necessarily a indication that you
	are under attack.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section toc="yes" anchor="query-classes" title="Common queries class that result in non responses.">
      <t>
	There are three common query class that result in non responses
	today.  These are EDNS <xref target="RFC2671"/> queries,
	queries for unknown (unallocated) or unsupported types and
	filtering of TCP queries.
      </t>
      <section toc="yes" anchor="edns" title="EDNS Queries">
	<t>
	  Identifying servers that fail to respond to EDNS queries
	  can be done by first identifying that the server responds
	  to regular DNS queries then making a series otherwise
	  identical responses using EDNS, then making the original
	  query again.  A series of EDNS queries is needed as at least
	  one DNS implementation responds to the first EDNS query
	  with FORMERR but fails to respond to subsequent queries
	  from the same address for a period until a regular DNS
	  query is made.  The EDNS query should specify a UDP buffer
	  size of 512 bytes to avoid false classification of not
	  supporting EDNS due to response packet size.
	</t>
	<t>
	  If the server responds to the first and last queries but
	  fails to respond to most or all of the EDNS queries it
	  is probably faulty.  The test should be repeated a number
	  of times to eliminate the likely hood of a false positive
	  due to packet loss.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Firewalls may also block larger EDNS responses but there
	  is no easy way to check authoritative servers to see if
	  the firewall is misconfigured.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section toc="yes" anchor="unknown" title="Unknown / Unsupported Type Queries">
	<t>
	  Identifying servers that fail to respond to unknown or
	  unsupported types can be done by making a initial DNS
	  query for a A record, making a number of queries for
	  unallocated type, them making a query for a A record
	  again.  IANA maintains a registry of allocated types.
	</t>
	<t>
	  If the server responds to the first and last queries but
	  fails to respond to the queries for the unallocated type
	  it is probably faulty.  The test should be repeated a
	  number of times to eliminate the likely hood of a false
	  positive due to packet loss.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section toc="yes" anchor="tcp" title="TCP Queries">
	<t>
	  All DNS servers are supposed to respond to queries over
	  TCP <xref target="RFC5966"/>.  Firewalls that drop TCP
	  connection attempts rather that resetting the connect
	  attempt or send a ICMP/ICMPv6 administratively prohibited
	  message introduce excessive delays to the resolution
	  process.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Whether a server accepts TCP connections can be tested
	  by first checking that it responds to UDP queries to
	  confirm that it is up and operating then attempting
	  the same query over TCP.  A additional query should
	  be made over UDP if the TCP connection attempt fails
	  to confirm that the server under test is still operating.
	</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section toc="yes" anchor="remediation" title="Remediating">
      <t>
	While the first step in remediating this problem is to get
	the offending nameserver code corrected, there is a very
	long tail problem with DNS servers in that it can often
	take over a decade between the code being corrected and a
	nameserver being upgraded with corrected code.  With that
	in mind it is requested that TLD, and other similar zone
	operators, take steps to identify and inform their customers,
	directly or indirectly through registrars, that they are
	running such servers and that the customers need to correct
	the problem.
      </t>
      <t>
	TLD operators should construct a list of servers child zones
	are delegated to along with a delegated zone name.  This
	name shall be the query name used to test the server as it
	is supposed to exist.
      </t>
      <t>
	For each server the TLD operator shall make a SOA query the
	delegated zone name.  This should result in the SOA record
	being returned in the answer section.  If the SOA record is
	not return but some other response is returned this is a
	indication of a bad delegation and the TLD operator should
	take whatever steps it normally takes to rectify a bad
	delegation.  If more that one zone is delegated to the server
	it should choose another zone until it finds a zone which
	responds correctly or it exhausts the list of zones delegated
	to the server.
      </t>
      <t>
	If the server fails to get a response to a SOA query the
	TLD operator should make a A query as some nameservers fail
	to respond to SOA queries but respond to A queries.  If it
	gets no response to the A query another delegated zone
	should be queried for as some nameservers fail to respond
	to zones they are not configured for.  If subsequent queries
	find a responding zone all delegation to this server need
	to be checked and rectified using the TLD's normal procedures.
      </t>
      <t>
	Having identified a working &lt;server, query name&gt; tuple the
	TLD operator should now check that the server responds to 
	EDNS, Unknown Query Type and TCP tests as described above.
	If the TLD operator finds that server fails any of the
	tests, the TLD operator shall take steps to inform the
	operator of the server that they are running a fault
	nameserver and that they need to take steps to correct the
	matter.  The TLD operator shall also record the &lt;server,
	query name&gt; for followup testing.
      </t>
      <t>
	If repeated attempts to inform and get the customer
	to correct / replace the fault server are unsuccessful
	the TLD operator shall remove all delegations to said
	server from the zone.
      </t>
      <t>
	It will also be necessary for TLD operators to repeat
	the scans periodically.  It is recommended that this
	be performed monthly backing off to bi-annually once
	the numbers of faulty servers found drops off to less
	than 1 in 100000 servers tested.  Follow up tests for
	faulty servers still need to be performed monthly.
      </t>
      <t>
	Some operators claim that they can't perform checks at
	registration time.  If a check is not performed at registration
	time it needs to be performed within a week of registration
	in order to detect faulty servers swiftly.
      </t>
      <t>
	Checking of delegations by TLD operators should be nothing
	new as they have been required from the very beginings of
	DNS to do this <xref target="RFC1034"/>.  Checking for
	compliance of nameserver operations should just be a extension
	of such testing.
      </t>
      <t>
	It is recommended that TLD operators setup a test web page
	which performs the tests the TLD operator performs as part
	of their regular audits to allow nameserver operators to
	test that they have correctly fixed their servers.  Such
	tests should be rate limited to avoid these pages being
	a denial of service vector.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section toc="yes" title="Firewalls and Load Balancers">
      <t>
	Firewalls and load balancers can affect the externally
	visible behaviour of a nameserver.  Tests for conformance
	need to be done from outside of any firewall so that the
	system as a whole is tested.
      </t>
      <t>
	Firewalls and load balancers should not drop DNS packets
	that they don't understand.  They should either pass through
	the packets or generate a appropriate error response.
      </t>
      <t>
	Requests for unknown query types are not attacks and
	should not be treated as such.
