		<t> This memo registers a trace field clause for use in
		    indicating transitions between handling queues or
		    processing states, including enacting inter- and
		    intra-host message transitions.  This might
		    include message quarantining, mailing list moderation,
		    timed delivery, queueing for further analysis, content
		    conversion, or other similar causes, as well as
		    optionally identifying normal handling queues. </t>
	</abstract>
</front>

<middle>
	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> <xref target="SMTP"/> defines the content of email
		    message trace fields, commonly the "Received" header field.
		    These are typically used to record an audit trail of
		    the path a message follows from origin to destination,
		    with one such field added each time a message moves from
		    one host to the next. </t>

		<t> Section 3.7.2 of that memo
		    mentions that "the most important use of of Received:
		    lines is for debugging mail faults [...]". </t>

		<t> There are some cases where there may be large time gaps
		    between trace fields.  Though this might be caused by
		    transient communication issues, they might also be caused
		    by policy decisions or special processing regarding the
		    content of the message, authorization of some
		    identity on the message, or transitions between major
		    software components.  Common examples include message
		    quarantines (filters that delay relaying or delivery
		    of a message pending manual operator action), pending
		    content analysis, or mailing list servers that impose
		    moderation rules (mailing list owner action required
		    regarding mail from authors not subscribed to those
		    lists). </t>

		<t> This memo registers a new optional clause that can be used
		    in trace fields to indicate that a message entered such
		    a special processing queue or state for some period.  This
		    allows inspection of the trace information to reveal that
		    the cause for a time gap in trace fields was an imposed
		    delay rather than one caused by transient technical
		    difficulties. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="keywords" title="Key Words">
		<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
		    "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
		    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
		    interpreted as described in
		    <xref target="KEYWORDS"/>. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="clause" title="New Trace Clause">
		<t> This memo creates a new trace field clause, called
		    "state", which can be used within Received header fields
		    (see Section 4.4 of <xref target="SMTP"/>)
		    to indicate the nature of a delay imposed on relaying of
		    a message toward its recipient(s).  It is followed by a
		    single keyword that provides that detail.  A Mail Transfer
		    Agent (MTA) or other handling agent that determines a
		    message has entered a state other than normal queueing of
		    messages for relaying or delivery MAY generate a trace
		    field including one of these clauses.  That is, the
		    presence of this clause on a trace field is an indication
		    of the entry of the message into that state; a later trace
		    field added would indicate its departure from that
		    state. </t>

		<t> Appropriate use of this mechanism does not include
		    associating meta-data with the message, such as
		    categorizing the message (e.g., the notions of "is spam"
		    or "was 8-bit, converted to 7-bit"). </t>

		<t> Use of this clause by transfer agents is OPTIONAL. </t>

		<t> The following state keywords are defined in this document;
		    extensions may define other registered keywords (see
		    <xref target="iana_states"/>):

		    <list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="auth:"> The message entered a
				queue pending authentication of some
				identifier in the message. </t>

			<t hangText="content:"> The message entered a
				queue pending content analysis, such as
				scanning for spam or viruses. </t>

			<t hangText="convert:"> The message entered a
				queue pending content conversion. </t>

			<t hangText="moderation:"> The message entered a
				hold pending mailing list moderator
				action. </t>

			<t hangText="normal:"> The message is not in an
				administrative hold and is queued for or
				is being handed off to the next handling
				agent (which may be local delivery).  This is
				the default interpretation when no "state"
				clause is present. </t>

			<t hangText="other:"> The message entered a
				hold or queue for reasons not covered by other
				keywords in this list, and not for
				transient technology issues. </t>

			<t hangText="outbound:"> The message entered a
				queue for outbound relaying.  This is
				typically the last case added for a single
				host, and the next Received header field is
				expected to be added by some other host. </t>

			<t hangText="quarantine:"> The message entered a
				hold in an isolation queue pending operator
				action for local policy reasons. </t>

			<t hangText="timed:"> The message entered a
				hold in order to meet a requested
				delivery window, such as is defined in
				<xref target="FUTURERELEASE"/>. </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<t> The "state" clause is added in <xref target="iana"/> to
		    the Additional-Registered-Clauses IANA sub-registry.
		    The ABNF for this clause is:

		    <figure><artwork>
   State = CFWS "state" FWS queue-state-keyword *( "/" value )

   queue-state-keyword = ( reg-state-keyword / unreg-state-keyword )

   reg-state-keyword = ( "auth" / "content" / "convert" /
                         "moderation" / "normal" / "other" / 
                         "outbound" / "quarantine" / "timed" /
                         additional-state-keyword )

   additional-state-keyword = unstructured
                            ; see "IANA Considerations" below

   value = token

   unreg-state-keyword = token
		    </artwork></figure> </t>

		<t> "FWS" and "CFWS" are defined in <xref target="MAIL"/>.
		    "token" is defined in <xref target="MIME"/>. </t>

		<t> A transfer agent making use of this extension MAY also
		    include header field comments to provide additional
		    information. </t>

		<t> The "value" is available for providing additional labels as
		    explanation for the state transition.  Examples could
		    include:

			<list style="symbols">
				<t> convert/unicode2ascii </t>

				<t> moderation/not-subscribed </t>

				<t> quarantine/spam </t>
			</list> </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="discussion" title="Discussion">
		<t> Handling agents are not expected to implement or support
		    all of these.  Indeed, recording trace information for
		    all of the states described above could make the
		    header of a message inordinately large.  Rather, an agent
		    is encouraged to apply state annotations when a
		    message enters a handling queue where substantial delay
		    is possible, and especially when a handoff has occurred
		    between two different, independent agents. </t>

		<t> For example, an MTA receiving a message, doing message
		    authentication, scanning for viruses and spam, and then
		    putting it in an outbound queue could add four Received
		    header fields denoting each of these states.  However,
		    where they are all done as part of a single system process,
		    in a single pass, doing so would be considered unusual
		    (and extremely verbose).  This method SHOULD NOT be
		    applied except when doing detailed analysis of a single
		    component to identify performance issues with those
		    steps. </t>

		<t> Rather, an agent that wishes to make a state annotation
		    SHOULD add only a single Received header field including
		    such annotation, thus indicating (a) the time of completion
		    of its handling of the message via the date portion of the
		    field, and (b) the final disposition of that message
		    relative to that agent.  For example, an MTA
		    receiving a message that performs various checks on
		    the message before immediately handing it off to a Mailing
		    List Manager (MLM) would only record a "normal" state,
		    assuming it passes those checks.  The MLM would then
		    evaluate the message and record its own state once it
		    decides what the next step will be for the handling of
		    that message. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="granularity" title="Granularity">
		<t> The degree of granularity -- and therefore the degree of
		    verbosity -- recorded through the use of this additional
		    trace clause is likely to vary depending on circumstances.
		    It will typically be the case that use of this clause will
		    be limited to "unusual" transitions, such as when a message
		    requires additional scrutiny or other processing, or needs
		    to be quarantined. </t>

		<t> Somewhat greater granularity might also include
		    transitions of administrative responsibility, such as
		    between an Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) operator and a
		    Mailing List Manager (MLM) operator.  This could be
		    further enhanced to note some transitions that are
		    interesting only when other transitions have occurred,
		    such as noting entry to the outbound queue only when the
		    message is originating from an "interesting" source, like
		    an MLM, since an MLM can introduce significant delay
		    and it could be useful to know when it completed its
		    processing, as distinct from the subsequent processing by
		    the originating MTA.  In circumstances needing very
		    fine-grained trace information, fields might be created
		    to note all of these "significant" network architecture
		    transitions. </t>

		<t> One should note, however, when choosing higher levels
		    of granularity, that the Received header fields present
		    on a message could be counted by MTAs when trying to decide
		    whether or not a message routing loop is in effect.  A
		    message with an abundance of these might cause an incorrect
		    determination that the message is in a delivery loop,
		    causing it to be removed from the mail stream.  See
		    Section 6.3 of <xref target="SMTP"/> for further
		    discussion. </t>

			<t> The message passed from internal.example.com to
			    newyork.example.com intended for a mailing list
			    hosted at the latter.  For list administrative
			    reasons, the message is held there for moderation.
			    It is finally released over an hour later and
			    passed to the next host.  A comment after
			    the state expression indicates the actual cause
			    for the administrative hold. </t>
