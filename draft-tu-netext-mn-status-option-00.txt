Internet-Draft         MN Status Option for PMIPv6          October 2011


1.  Introduction

   There is a need for the local mobility anchor to decide and perform
   the flow mobility from one access network to another,e.g. from 3GPP
   to WLAN or from WLAN to WiMAX.  Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification
   [RFC5213] allows carrying of the Access Technology Type information
   from the mobile access gateway to the local mobility anchor.
   However, the Access Technology Type information is insufficient to
   provide the local mobility anchor enough information to guarantee the
   flow mobility is successfully completed, in which the mobile node
   status (e.g. connect, disconnect or idle/power saving mode) is unkown
   for the local mobility anchor.  In this case, the local mobility
   anchor may choose one of the access networks which is currently
   unavailable as the target to move a specific IP flow according to the
   operator preferences and local policies.  To prevent this, the mobile
   node status needs to be updated from the mobility access gateway to
   the local mobility anchor.

   This document defines a new mobility option, MN Status option for
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), that can be used by mobile access gateway
   (MAG) for carrying the MN status with the correspondent access
   network to the local mobility anchor.

3.  MN status option for PMIPv6

3.1.  Overview

   In some deployments the network (e.g. 3GPP) needs to support the
   multiple access technologies for the mobile node, and the local
   mobility anchor can be triggered to decide which access technology
   will be used to move the particular IP flow according to the operator
   preferences and local policy.  To guarantee the flow mobility
   procedure from one access technology to another is succeed, one of
   the key information should be obtained by the LMA is the currently
   mobile node status with correspondent access network type
   information.

   The mobility access gateway is the right one to detect the mobile
   node status using the mechanisms as defined in RFC5213, furthermore,
   each access network has defined its own mechanisms to detect the

   connectivity status of the attached mobile node.

   The mobile node status can be carried in the messages exchange
   between the MAG and LMA, be more specific, the MAG can periodic or be
   event triggered to update the MN status to the LMA.  How the LMA use
   this information is outside the scope of this document.

3.2.  Mobile Node Status Option

   A new option, Mobile Node Status Option, is defined for using it in
   messages (e.g.  PBU and PBA) exchanged between a local mobility
   anchor and a mobile access gateway.

   MN-status Length

   8-bit unsigned integer indicating the length in octets of the option,
   excluding the type and length fields.

   Mobile Node status

   The status of the mobile node attached from a specific access
   network, such as WiFi,WiMAX and 3GPP.  Currently the value of the MN
   status can be as follow:

   1,connect mode,

   2,disconnect mode,

   3,idle/Power saving mode
