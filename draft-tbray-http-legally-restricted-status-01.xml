    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document specifies an additional Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
      status code for use when resource access is denied due to legal demands.
      This allows server operators to provide greater transparency
      in circumstances where issues of law or public policy affect their
      operation. This transparency may be beneficial both to these operators
      and to end users.</t>
      
      <t>Feedback should occur on the ietf-http-wg@w3.org mailing list,
      although this draft is NOT a work item of the IETF HTTPbis Working
      Group. </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
      this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>


    <section title="451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons">
      <t>This status code indicates that the server is denying access
      to the resource in response to a legal demand.</t> 
      
      <t>Since such demands typically apply to all operators in a
      legal jurisdiction, the server in question may or may not be an
      origin server.  The demands typically most directly affect
      the operations of ISPs and search engines.</t>

      <t>Responses using this status code SHOULD include an explanation,
      in the response body, of the details of the legal demand: which
      legal authority is making it, and what class of resources it applies
      to.  For example:</t>

      <figure><artwork xml:space="preserve">
HTTP/1.1 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons
Content-Type: text/html

&lt;html>
&lt;head>
&lt;title>Unavailable For Legal Reasons&lt;/title>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
&lt;h1>Unavailable For Legal Reasons&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This request may not be serviced in the Roman Province 
of Judea due to the Lex Julia Majestatis, which disallows 
access to resources hosted on servers deemed to be 
operated by the People&#x2019;s Front of Judea.&lt;/p>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html></artwork></figure>

<t>The use of the 451 status code implies neither the existence nor
non-existence of the resource named in the request. That is to say,
it is possible that if the legal demands were removed,
a request for the resource still might not succeed.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <section title="451 Unavailable for Legal Reasons">
	<t>The 451 status code is optional; clients cannot rely upon its
	use. It is possible that certain legal authorities may wish
	to avoid transparency, and not only demand the restriction of access 
        to certain resources, but also avoid disclosing that the demand 
        was made.  </t>
      </section>


    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>The HTTP Status Codes Registry should be updated with the
      following entries:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
	<t>Code: 451</t>
	<t>Description: Unavailable for Legal Reasons</t>
	<t>Specification: [ this document ]</t>
      </list></t>

    <section title="Acknowledgements">
      <t>Thanks to Terence Eden, who observed that the existing
      status code 403 was not really suitable for this situation, and
      suggested the creation of a new status code.</t>
      <t>Thanks also to Ray Bradbury.</t>
