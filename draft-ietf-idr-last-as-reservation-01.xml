	    <t>This document reserves two Autonomous System numbers (ASNs) at the end of the 16 bit and 32 bit ranges, described in this document as "Last ASNs" and provides guidance to implementers and operators on their use.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
	    <t>IANA has reserved the last Autonomous System Number (ASN), 65535, of the 16 bit autonomous system number range for over a decade with the intention that it not be used by network operators running BGP <xref target="RFC4271" />.  Since the introduction of BGP Support for Four-Octet AS Number Space <xref target="RFC6793" />, IANA has also reserved the ASN of the 32 bit autonomous system number range, 4294967295.  This reservation has been documented in the IANA Autonomous System Numbers Registry <xref target="IANA.AS" />.  Although these "Last ASNs" border on Private Use ASN <xref target="RFC6996" /> ranges, they are not defined or reserved as Private Use ASNs by <xref target="IANA.AS" />.  This document describes the reasoning for reserving these Last ASNs and provides guidance both to operators and to implementers on their use.</t>
    </section>
     <section title="Requirements Language">
       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
     </section>
    <section anchor="reasons" title="Reasons for Last ASNs Reservation">
	    <t>A subset of the BGP communities of ASN 65535, the last ASN of the 16 bit range, are reserved for use by Well-known communities as described in <xref target="RFC1997" /> and <xref target="IANA.WK" />.  Although this is not currently true of ASN 4294967295, if there is a future need for another Special Use ASN that is not designed to be globally routable, or the associated BGP communities of such an ASN, ASN 4294967295 could be a valid candidate for such purpose.  This document does not prescribe any such Special Use to this ASN at the time of publication.</t> 
    </section>
    <section anchor="ops" title="Operational Considerations">
	    <t>Operators SHOULD NOT use these Last ASNs as if they are Private Use ASNs or for any other purpose.  Operational use of these Last ASNs could have undesirable results.  For example; use of AS 65535 as if it were a Private Use ASN, may result in inadvertent use of BGP Well-known Community values <xref target="IANA.WK" />, causing undesireable routing behavior.</t>
	    <t>These last ASNs MUST NOT be advertised to the global Internet within AS_PATH or AS4_PATH attributes.  Operators that choose to do inbound filtering of Private Use ASNs within the AS_PATH and AS4_PATH attributes SHOULD also filter these Last ASNs.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="impl" title="Implementation Considerations">
	    <t>While these Last ASNs are reserved, they remain valid ASNs from a BGP protocol perspective.  Therefore, implementations of BGP <xref target="RFC4271" /> SHOULD NOT treat the use of these Last ASNs as any type of protocol error.  However, implementations MAY generate a local warning message indicating improper use of a reserved ASN.</t>
	    <t>Implementations that provide tools that filter Private Use ASNs within the AS_PATH and AS4_PATH attributes MAY also include these Last ASNs.</t>
    </section>
   <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
	   <t>IANA has reserved last Autonomous System number 65535 from the "16-bit Autonomous System Numbers" registry for the reasons described in this document.</t>
	   <t>IANA has also reserved last Autonomous System number 4294967295 from the "32-bit Autonomous System Numbers" registry for the reasons described in this document.</t>
	   <t>This reservation has been documented in the IANA Autonomous System Numbers Registry <xref target="IANA.AS"/>.</t>
   </section>
   <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
	   <t>This document does not introduce any additional security concerns in regards to usage of Last ASNs.  Although the BGP protocol is designed to allow usage of these Last ASNs, security issues related to BGP implementation errors could be triggered by Last ASN usage.</t>
