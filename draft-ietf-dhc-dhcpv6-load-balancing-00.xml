    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a method of algorithmic load balancing for
      IPv6 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) traffic.  It enables
      multiple, cooperating servers to decide which one should service a client,
      without exchanging any information beyond initial configuration.

      The server selection is based on the servers hashing client DHCP Unique
      Identifiers (DUIDs) when multiple DHCPv6 (DHCPv6) servers are available
      to service DHCPv6 clients.  The proposed technique provides for efficient
      server selection when multiple DHCPv6 servers offer services on a network
      without requiring any changes to existing DHCPv6 clients.  The same method
      is proposed to select the target server of a DHCPv6 relay.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This protocol is intended to extend the algorithm described in
      <xref target="RFC3074">RFC 3074</xref> to apply to <xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref>
      traffic.  Most of the terminology and procedures are identical to
      the ones specified in RFC 3074.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Background and External Requirements">
       <t>The requirements for DHCPv6 are substantially the same as for
       DHCPv4, replacing DHCPDISCOVER with SOLICIT, DHCPREQUEST with
       REQUEST, CONFIRM, RENEW, or REBIND (as appropriate), etc.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Operation">
      <t>
      A DHCPv6 server performing this load balancing will operate in
      substantially the same manner as if it were a DHCPv4 server load
      balancing an incoming DHCPv4/BOOTP packet with the following
      differences.</t>

      <section title="Messages with a Server ID">
	<t>Certain messages which contain a Server ID to direct that
        message may need to be handled as if load balancing were not
        in play.</t>
        <section title="RELEASE, DECLINE, and INFORMATION-REQUEST">
      	  <t>A DHCPv6 server receiving a RELEASE, DECLINE, or
	  INFORMATION-REQUEST with its own Server ID SHOULD answer the
          answer the message as if there were no load balancing in play.
          Since there is no retry mechanism
	  for RELEASE or DECLINE, or only a simple retransmit for
	  INFORMATION-REQUEST, if the server were to ignore the message
	  either the state of the address would be incorrect, or no information
	  would be transferred to the client even though it was instructed
	  to try the INFORMATION-REQUEST against this particular server.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="REQUEST and RENEW">
          <t>A DHCPv6 server receiving a REQUEST or RENEW with the server's
          Server ID specified MAY answer the request even if the request would
          normally be ignored by load balancing.  If there were a pair of
	  cooperating DHCPv6 servers (perhaps a failover pair), and after a
	  failure of one of the servers a large portion of the population may
	  have bound to the second server.  When the first server returns to
	  service, the clients will continue to Renew against the second server.
	  If the second server ignores the requests, eventually the client will
	  transition to doing a Rebind, at which point since there is no Server
	  ID specified, the first server could then answer the client.  The end
	  result would be that the server loads would eventually become balanced
	  again.</t>
	  <t>If the secondary server is choosing to continue to respect the load
	  balancing in the above case, then the server SHOULD NOT use the Delayed
	  Service Parameter feature for the requests containing the server's
	  Server ID.  If the Delayed Service Parameter was still being used, then
	  it is likely that the client would never reach the Rebinding state, and
	  the secondary server might as well have answered the first request that
	  arrived instead of waiting for some number of seconds before
	  answering.</t>
          <t>If the secondary server continues to answer the requests, then
          the server load will not rebalance until the clients are rebooted,
          or transition to a Rebind through any other mechanism.</t>
	  <t>A server MAY choose to answer REQUESTs and ignore RENEWs so that
	  for the REQUEST it is choosing to not require the client to go
	  through the entire set of retries and go back to SOLICIT before
	  getting a response, but ignore RENEWs to cause the devices to
	  switch servers at the REBIND time.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Selecting the STID">
        <t>DHCPv6 servers MUST use the client's DUID in its entirety as the
        STID.  This is different than RFC 3074 which limited the STID to 16
        bytes.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Replacing the secs field">
        <t>A DHCPv6 server providing the capability of Delayed Service
        SHOULD use the value in the OPTION_ELAPSED_TIME wherever RFC 3074
        makes reference to the secs field.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
   <t>This proposal in and by itself provides no security, nor does it
   impact existing security.  Servers using this algorithm are
   responsible for ensuring that if the contents of the HBA are
   transmitted over the network as part of the process of configuring
   any server, that message be secured against tampering, since
   tampering with the HBA could result in denial of service for some or
   all clients.</t>
