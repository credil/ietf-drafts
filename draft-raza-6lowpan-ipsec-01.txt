  Compression of IPsec AH and ESP Headers for Constrained Environments
                      draft-raza-6lowpan-ipsec-01

Abstract

   This document describes the header compression mechanisms for the
   IPsec [RFC4301] based on the encoding scheme standardized in
   [RFC6282]. The IPsec Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulated
   Security Payload (ESP) headers are compressed using Next Header
   Compression (NHC) defined in [RFC6282]. This document does not
   invalidate any encoding schemes proposed in 6LoWPAN [RFC6282] but
   rather complements it with compressed IPsec using the free bits in
   the IPv6 Extension Header encoding.

INTERNET DRAFT             IPsec-for-6LoWPAN           September 3, 2013


1  Introduction

   [RFC6282] defines how IPv6 datagrams can be routed over IEEE 802.15.4
   [IEEE802.15.4]-based networks. [RFC6282] defines a header compression
   schemes that can significantly reduce the size of IP, IP extension,
   and UDP headers. This enables the routing of heavy-weight IP traffic
   to resource-constrained [IEEE802.15.4]-based wireless network. The
   security in [IEEE802.15.4]-based IP network or what is more commonly
   known 6LoWPAN networks is particularly important as we connect the
   insecure Internet with the vulnerable wireless network. The
   standardized and mandatory security solution for IPv6 is IP security
   (IPsec) [RFC4301]. This means that every IPv6 host on Internet is
   able to process IP packets secured with IPsec. IPsec, in transport
   mode, can provide end-to-end (E2E)secure communication between the
   two hosts in the IP network. Thus, it is beneficial to extend 6LoWPAN
   so that IPsec communication between an IPv6 device (e.g. a sensor
   node) in 6LoWPAN and IPv6 nodes on conventional Internet becomes
   possible. This document does not cover the tunnel mode of IPsec.

   With IPv6 architecture it is possible to protect ICMPv6 messages,
   using IPsec. As the RPL Control Message [RFC6550] is an ICMPv6
   message, it is therefore possible to protect it with IPsec.  However,
   all RPL Control Message, except DAO / DAO-ACK messages in non-storing
   mode, are exchanged between two neighboring devices and have the
   scope of a link. Though IPsec security associations can be created
   between two neighboring devices, IEEE 802.15.4 security at the link
   layer is more suitable for per-hop protection, and IPsec in transport
   mode can be used to protect DAO/DAO-ACK messages in non-storing mode.
   

   It is desirable to complement 6LoWPAN header compression with IPsec
   to keep packet sizes reasonable in resource constrained IEEE 802.15.4
   [IEEE802.15.4]-based network. There are no header compression
   specified for IPsec's AH[RFC4302] and ESP[RFC4303] extension headers.
   This draft therefore proposes AH and ESP extension header encoding
   schemes.

2.  Linking IPsec Headers Compression with 6LoWPAN

   [RFC6282] defines the general format of NHC that can be used to
   encode IP extension headers. [RFC6282] already defines an NHC

INTERNET DRAFT             IPsec-for-6LoWPAN           September 3, 2013


   encoding for IPv6 Extension Headers (NHC_EH) that can be used to link
   uncompressed AH and ESP headers to the 6LoWPAN header compression. In
   order to compress the IP extension headers a GHC byte for Extension
   Header (GHC_EH) [draft-bormann-6lowpan-ghc-05] is proposed which has
   the same layout as NHC_EH with different ID bits. NHC_EH and GHC_EH
   consist of an octet where three bits (bits 4, 5 and 6) are used to
   encode the IPv6 Extension Header ID (EID). Out of eight possible
   values for the EID, six are assigned and the remaining two slots (101
   and 110) are currently unassigned. As AH and ESP are IP extension
   headers it makes sense to use one of these unassigned slots for the
   IPsec headers. We propose to use the reserved slot 101 for the IPsec
   headers, AH or ESP. The corresponding ID  field in the AH or ESP will
   distinguish these headers from each other. It is also necessary to
   set the NH bit in NHC_EH or GHC_EH to 1 to specify that the next
   header (a header after AH or ESP, e.g. UDP) is NHC-encoded.

3. LOWPAN_NHC for Authentication Header

   6LoWPAN  can be used to compress a significant number of bits in AH.
   The next header is decided based on the value of NH bit in the IPv6
   Extension Header Encoding in [RFC6282]. This draft proposes to always
   elide the length field. The payload length field (the length of AH
   header in 32-bit words units minus "2" [RFC4302]) in the AH header is
   always elided, as it can be inferred from the lower layers: either
   from the IEEE 802.15.4 header or the 6LoWPAN header. The size of ICV
   can be obtained from the SPI value because the length of the
   authenticating data depend on the algorithm used and are fixed for
   any input size. The RESERVED field in the AH header is also always
   elided. The SPI and SN are compressed using the proposed NHC encoding
   for the AH header shown in Figure 1 and are explained below.

      (SA), but that every node has a single preferred SA, identified by
      SPI 1. If SPI = 01:  the least significant 8 bits of the SPI are
      carried inline; the remaining 24 bits are elided. If SPI = 10:

INTERNET DRAFT             IPsec-for-6LoWPAN           September 3, 2013


      the least significant 16 bits of the SPI are carried inline; the
      remaining 16 bits are elided. If SPI = 11:  All 32 bits of the SPI
      are carried inline. 

   o  If SN = 00: the least significant 8 bits of sequence number are
      carried inline. The remaining bits are elided. If SN = 01:  the
      least significant 16 bits of the SN are carried inline; the
      remaining 16 bits are elided. If SPI = 10:  the least significant
      24 bits of the SPI are carried inline; the remaining 8 bits are
      elided. If SPI = 11:  All 32 bits of the SPI are carried inline. 

      The sequence number field in the AH header [RFC4302] contains a
      value 1 for the first packet sent using a given Security
      Association (SA), and it is incremented sequentially for the
      subsequent packets. Note that by using 8-bit sequence number we do
      not limit the size of sequence number to 255, but propose to use 8
      bits for the sequence number prior to the transmission of the
      256th packet on an SA. From the 2^8 to 2^(16-1) we propose to use
      16-bit sequence number. Follow the same procedure for the 24-bit
      sequence number as well. However, the sender and the receiver
      sequence number counters must be reset prior to sending 2^32nd
      packet as proposed in [RFC4302].

   Note that even when used in 6LoWPAN, AH calculates the ICV on the
   uncompressed IP header, thus allowing authenticated communication
   with Internet hosts. The minimum length of a standard AH, supporting
   the mandatory HMAC-SHA1-96[RFC4835], consists of 12 bytes of header
   fields plus 12 bytes of ICV. Figure 2 shows a sample NHC compressed
   IP/UDP packet secured with AH. Using NHC encoding for the AH we can
   reduce the AH header overhead from 24 bytes to 14 bytes: 1 byte of
   next header, 1 byte of length, 2 bytes of Reserved field, 4 bytes of
   SPI, and 2 bytes of sequence number. However, two additional bytes
   are used to define NHC_EH and NHC_AH. Therefore, in the best case,
   with AES-XCBC-MAC-96[RFC3566] or HMAC-SHA1-96 ciphers (when 12 bytes
   are used for ICV), applying NHC encoding for AH saves 8 bytes in each
   data packet secured with IPsec AH.

4. LOWPAN_NHC for Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP)

   The encryption in the IPsec ESP includes Payload Data, Padding, Pad
   Length and Next Header fields in the ESP. Therefore, we cannot
   compress these fields at the 6LoWPAN layer, and these fields are
   always carried inline. Also, when using ESP the UDP header and
   payload is also encrypted, hence cannot be compressed using NHC
   encodings for UDP defined in the [RFC6282]. However, we can compress
   the SPI and and sequence number (SN) fields in the ESP header. Figure
   3 shows a proposed NHC encodings for the ESP that are explained
   below.

      Section 3 for the AH header. 

   In case of ESP we cannot skip the next header unless the end hosts
   are able to execute 6LoWPAN compression/decompression and
   encryption/decryption jointly. The nodes in the 6LoWPAN network make
   their decision about the next header based on the NH value not the
   actual header that is carried inline. In the case of ESP we MUST set
   the NH value in the NHC_EH or GHC_EH to zero to indicate that the
   full 8 bits of next header field are carried inline.

   Figure 4: A sample NHC compressed IP/UDP packet secured with ESP.

   With perfect block alignment, the minimum ESP overhead without
   authentication is 10 bytes [RFC4303]. After optimal compression this
   header overhead is reduced to 6 bytes, considering that two bytes are
   used for NHC_EH and NHC_ESP. ESP also includes an IV which is equal
   to the size of an encryption block; 16 bytes in the case of AES. If
   authentication is enabled in the ESP, additional 12 bytes of ICV are
   also required. Figure 4 shows an UDP/IP packet secured with
   compressed ESP.

5. Implementation Considerations

   We provide an open source implementation of the proposed compression
   scheme in the Contiki operating system. The implementation is
   released under BSD license and can be obtained through the
   contikiprojects repository at the following URI:
   svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/contikiprojects/code/sics.se/ipsec

6. Security Considerations

   The compression scheme proposed in this document does not compromise
   any of the security provided by IPsec AH and ESP. In particular, the
   SN field is compressed in an on-demand fashion, as described in
   Section 3. In order to overcome replay attacks, it is recommended
   that the communication end-points should re-establish a security
   association before the sequence number overflows. However, in
   constrained environments, different implementations can decide the
   overflow size; 2^8, 2^16, 2^24, or 2^32. This leads to a trade-off
   between the overhead incurred by establishing a new security
   association and by sending more bits of sequence number. The
   Initialization Vector (IV) and Integrity Check Value (ICV) are also
   not compressed to take full advantage of IPsec AH and ESP security.

7. IANA Considerations

   [RFC6282] creates a new IANA registry for the LOWPAN_NHC header type
   where the two slots, 1110101N and 1110110N, in LOWPAN_NHC for the
   IPv6  Extension Header are unassigned. This document requests the
   assignment of one of these two unassigned values, 1110101N, to IPsec
   AH and ESP. This document also requests the assignment of following
   contents:

   1101XXYY: The 6LOWPAN_NHC encoding for the IPsec Authentication
