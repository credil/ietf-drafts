<abstract>
  <t>
    This document is a template applicability statement for the Routing over
    Low-power and Lossy Networks (ROLL) WG.  This document is not for
    publication, but rather is to be used as a template.

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
      This document describes a series of questions which should be answered.
      This document is intended to remain as a Internet Draft.
</t>
<t>
The idea is that current and future Applicability statements will use the table of contents
provided.   The goal is that all applicability statements will have to cover the listed
items as a minimum.
</t>
  <section title="Requirements Language">
    <t>(RFC2119 reference)</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Terminology">
  <t>
     A reference to draft-ietf-roll-terminology is appropriate.
     A reference to layer-2 specific terminology and/or inclusion of any
     terms that are normatively referenced is appropriate here.
  </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Required Reading">
    <t> References/Overview of requirements documents, both
           IETF and industry group.  (two pages maximum.  This text
           should be (very) technical, should be aimed at IETF *participants*,
           not industry group participants, and should explain this
           industries' specific issues)
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Out of scope requirements">
    <t>
           This should list other documents (if any) which deal with
           situations where things are not in scope for this document.
    </t>
    <t>
           (For instance, the AMI document tries to cover both line-powered
           urban metering networks, and energy-constrained metering networks,
           and also tries to deal with rural requirements.  This should
           be three or four documents, so this section should list the
           limits of what this document covers)
    </t>
  </section>
</section>

<section title="Deployment Scenario">
  <section title="Network Topologies">
    <t>
       describe a single scenario, with possibly
       multiple topologies that a single utility would employ.
    </t>

  </section>
  <section title="Traffic Characteristics">
    <t>
       Explain what kind of traffic is being transmitted, where it is
       initiated, and what kinds of protocols (CoAP, multicast, HTTPS, etc.)
       are being used.  Explain what assumptions are being made about
       authentication and authorization in those protocols.

   <section title="Layer-2 applicability.">
   <t>
       Explain what layer-2 technologies this statement applies to, and
       if there are options, they should be listed generally here, and
       specifically in section 4.2.
   </t>
   </section>
</section>

<section title="Using RPL to Meet Functional Requirements  ">
<t>

     This should explain in general terms how RPL is going to be used
     in this network topology.  If trees that are multiple
     layers deep are expected, then this should be described so that the fan
     out is understood.
     Some sample topologies (from simulations) should be explained, perhaps
     with images references from other publications.
</t>
<t>
     This section should tell an *implementer* in a lab, having a simulation
     tool or a building/city/etc. to use as a testbed, how to construct
     an LLN of sufficient complexity (but not too much) to validate an
     implementation.
</t>
</section>

<section title="RPL Profile  ">
<t>
     This section should list the various features of RPL plus other layers
     of the LLN, and how they will be used.
</t>

  <section title="Layer-2 features">
    <section title="Specifics about layer-2">
    <t>
    this section should detail the specific layer-2 network technology that
    this document applies to.  A class of technologies is generally not
    acceptable.
    </t>

    <section title="Trickle Parameters "></section>
    <section title="Other Parameters "></section>
  </section>
</section>

<section title="MPL Profile">
<t>
     This section should list the various features of MPL.
     In considering the parameters, a number of questions come up:

<list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
<t hangText="1)">What are the maximum and minimum 1-hop MPL router neighbours of all the MPL routers?</t>
<t hangText="2)">what is the arrival rate of new packets that need repetition in a MPL router</t>
<t hangText="3)"> Is there a deadline associated with the packets</t>
<t hangText="4)"> What is the shortest number of hops of the longest path between sources and destinations</t>
<t hangText="5)"> What are the values of the MAC: back-off values, retries, buffer size.</t>
<t hangText="6)"> What is the background load of other non MPL applications.</t>
<t hangText="7)"> arrival probability of 1-hop packets</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
As the corresponding design space is incredibly large, probably only a
limited subset of the design space is viable.
</t>

<t>
Here is an example scenario:

<list style="symbols">
<t hangText="1)">5 neighbours</t>
<t hangText="2)">once every 100 ms (rate at sources is once every 300-500 ms)</t>
<t hangText="3)">yes, 200 ms</t>
<t hangText="4)">5 hops, with mostly 1 hop</t>
<t hangText="5)">no buffer, retry 1, back-off 2</t>
<t hangText="6)">absent</t>
<t hangText="7)">100-80%</t>
</list>

leading to k=3-5, Imin =30-70 ms, repeat = 2, Imax n/a.
</t>

<t>
It is crital operational boundary conditions together with appropriate
MPL parameter values are published in this applicability statements.
All applicability statements together may give a good hint which MPL
parameters and boundary conditions to choose.

<section title="Security Considerations  ">
  <section title="Security Considerations during initial deployment">
  <t>
        (This section explains how nodes get their initial trust anchors,
        initial network keys.  It explains if this happens at the factory,
        in a deployment truck, if it is done in the field, perhaps
        like
        http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/hipercom/SmartObjectSecurity/papers/CullenJennings.pdf)
  </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Security Considerations during incremental deployment ">
  <t>
        (This section explains how that replaces a failed node takes
        on the dead nodes' identity, or not.  How are nodes retired.
        How are nodes removed if they are compromised)
  </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Security Considerations for P2P uses">
  <t>
        (When layer-3 RPL security is used, P2P DODAGs are ephemeral, and may
        have different security needs.)
