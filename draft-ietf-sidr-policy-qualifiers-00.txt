                 Policy Qualifiers in RPKI Certificates
                  draft-ietf-sidr-policy-qualifiers-00

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 6487 by clarifying the inclusion of policy
   qualifiers in the certificate policies extension of RPKI resource
   certificates.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Update to RFC 6487

   [RFC6487] profiles certificates, certificate revocation lists, and
   certificate signing requests specified in [RFC5280] for use in
   routing public key infrastructure.

   [RFC5280] defines an extension to certificates for the listing of
   policy information (See section 4.2.1.4).  [RFC6487] states in
   Section 4.8.9: "This extension MUST be present and MUST be marked
   critical.  It MUST include exactly one policy, as specified in the
   RPKI CP [RFC6484]".  This references the CertPolicyId of the sequence
   allowed in PolicyInformation as defined by [RFC5280].

   [RFC5280] also specifies that PolicyInformation may optionally have a
   sequence of PolicyQualifierInfo objects.  [RFC6487] does not
   specifically allow or disallow these PolicyQualifierInfo objects
   although it also states in section 4: "Unless specifically noted as
   being OPTIONAL, all the fields listed here MUST be present, and any
   other fields MUST NOT appear in a conforming resource certificate."

   This document updates [RFC6487], Section 4.8.9, as follows:

      OLD:

         This extension MUST be present and MUST be marked critical.  It
         MUST include exactly one policy, as specified in the RPKI CP
         [RFC6484].

      NEW:

         This extension MUST be present and MUST be marked critical.  It
         MUST include exactly one policy, as specified in the RPKI CP

         [RFC6484].  Exactly one policy qualifier MAY be included.  If a
         policy qualifier is included, the policyQualifierId MUST be the
         CPS pointer qualifier type (id-qt-cps).

   As noted in [RFC5280], section 4.2.1.4: "Optional qualifiers, which
   MAY be present, are not expected to change the definition of the
   policy."  In this case any optional policy qualifiers that MAY be
   present in a resource certificate MUST NOT change the definition of
   the RPKI CP [RFC6484].

3.  IANA Considerations

   None.

4.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of [RFC6487] apply to this document.

   This document updates the RPKI certificate profile to specify that
   the certificate policies extension can include a policy qualifier,
   which is a URI.  Checking of the URI might allow denial-of-service
   (DoS) attacks, where the target host may be subjected to bogus work
   resolving the URI.  However, this specification, like [RFC5280],
   places no processing requirements on the URI included in the
   qualifier.

5.  Acknowledgements

   Frank Hill and Adam Guyot helped define the scope of this issue and
   identified and worked with RPKI validator implementers to clarify the
   use of policy qualifiers in resource certificates.

   Sean Turner provided significant text to this document regarding the
   processing of the CPS URI and limiting the scope of the allowable
   content of the policy qualifier.
