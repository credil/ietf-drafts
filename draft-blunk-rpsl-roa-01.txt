                A ROA Status Attribute for RPSL Objects
                      draft-blunk-rpsl-roa-01.txt

Abstract

   This document describes an attribute for Routing Policy Specification
   Language (RPSL) route and route6 objects that documents the presence
   and validity of a Route Origin Authorization (ROA) for the given
   prefix and origin values contained within the object.  It allows
   parties who employ Internet Routing Registries (IRR's) for routing
   policy configuration generation to easily ascertain whether a given
   object has a ROA covering the object.  The primary objective is to
   enable existing IRR tools to make use of the ROA information with
   minimal modifications.

Internet-Draft               RPSL ROA Status                   June 2013


1.  Introduction

   Objects stored in Internet Routing Registries are used by a number of
   Internet Providers to generate router configurations.  The tools they
   employ are based upon the RPSL format.  The IETF work within the SIDR
   Working Group will likely require extensive modifications to these
   existing tools in order to support new standards such as the ROA
   which provides equivalent functionality to the RPSL route and route6
   objects.  However, the RPSL standard provides a number of
   capabilities and object types which do not yet have functional
   equivalents defined within the SIDR Working Group.  Examples include
   RPSL objects such as aut-num's, as-set's, and route-set's.  It is
   likely that Internet Providers will wish to continue to use the RPSL
   standard for some time, while potentially leveraging the work that is
   being done in the SIDR Working Group to improve the security and
   robustness of the RPSL information that is present in IRR's.


2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  ROA Status Syntax and Semantics

   The ROA Status attribute is named "roa-status" (case insensitive) and
   is a generated attribute.  An IRR user MUST NOT be permitted to
   submit an object with the ROA Status attribute already present.  It
   is dependent on the routing registry service to securely verify the
   ROA Status and generate the attribute for a given route or route6
   object.  Further, the ROA Status of an object must be periodically
   re-checked after initial generation.  It is RECOMMENDED that the ROA
   Status attribute be regenerated at least once per day.

   The ROA Status attribute consists of multiple fields.  These fields
   are structured in a sequence of name and value pairs, separated by a
   semicolon ";" and a white space.  Collectively, these fields make up
   the value of the ROA Status attribute.  The "name" part of such a
   component is always a single ASCII character that serves as an
   identifier; the value is an ASCII string the contents of which depend
   on the field type.

   Fields of the ROA Status attribute:

   1.  Version number of the ROA Status attribute (field "v").  This
       field is REQUIRED and MUST be set to "1".

   2.  The ROA validity status (field "s") of the prefix and origin pair
       given in the route or route6 object.  This field is REQUIRED and
       MUST contain one of three possible values -- "valid", "invalid",
       or "unknown".  These possible three values reflect the "validity
       state" of the prefix/origin pair following RFC 6483 [RFC6483].

   3.  ROA Max length (field "m").  For objects with a "valid" ROA
       Status, this fields contains the value of maxLength in the ROA
       covering the prefix in the route or route6 object, if present.
       If the covering ROA does not contain a maxLength value, this
       field MUST be omitted.

   4.  Time ROA cache last refreshed (field "t").  This field is
       REQUIRED and represents the last time the ROA cache data used to
       determine the "status" field value was refreshed.  The time is
       expressed in RFC 3339 [RFC3339] Internet time format.  The
       timestamp is expected to contain the time of the last successful
       cache refresh and is used to indicate the freshness of the status
       check.

   5.  ROA URI (field "u").  This is an OPTIONAL field which SHOULD be
       provided upon request.  Whois servers may choose to use a query
       flag as a signal to provide this field in the whois output.  The
       field contains an RFC 5781 [RFC5781] rsync reference to a ROA.
       In the case of a "valid" status, the field contains the URI for
       ROA that was used to validate the prefix/origin pair in the
       object.  For an "invalid" status, the will be at least one, and
       possibly multiple ROA's, with different origin AS fields which
       result in the invalid status.  In the case of multiple ROA's,
       there will be multiple "u" fields -- one for each ROA covering
       the prefix.  In the case of an "unknown" status, there are no
       covering ROA's and this field is omitted.


4.  Security Considerations

   RPSL objects stored in the IRR databases are public, and as such
   there is no need for confidentiality.  Applications may wish to
   validate the referenced ROA in the ROA-URI field for objects with a
   "valid" ROA Status.  IRR objects are traditionally retrieved by the
   insecure whois TCP protocol and objects may be subject to
   modification or deletion while in transit.  IRR operators may want to
   pursue more secure protocols for query interfaces such as SSL.
   Additionally, IRR operators that provide their database in a bulk
   format for download may wish to provide a digital signature for the
