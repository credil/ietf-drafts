    RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block for MPEG2
   Transport Stream (TS) Program Specific Information (PSI) dependent
               Decodability Statistics Metrics reporting
            draft-bi-xrblock-rtcp-xr-psi-dep-decodability-01

Abstract

   An MPEG2 Transport Stream (TS) is a standard container format used in
   the transmission and storage of multimedia data.  Unicast/Multicast
   MPEG2 TS over RTP is widely deployed in IPTV systems.  This document
   defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block
   that allows the reporting of MPEG2 TS decodability statistics metrics
   related to transmissions of MPEG2 TS over RTP.  The metrics specified
   in the RTCP XR Block are dependent on Program specific information
   carried in MPEG TS.

Internet-Draft           RTCP XR TS Decodability               July 2013


1.  Introduction

1.1.  MPEG2 Transport Stream Decodability Metrics

   The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has
   defined a set of syntax and information consistency tests and
   corresponding indicators [ETSI] that are recommended for the
   monitoring of MPEG2 Transport Streams [ISO-IEC.13818-1.2007].  The
   tests and corresponding indicators are grouped according to priority:

   o  First priority - Necessary for decodability (basic monitoring)
   o  Second priority - Recommended for continuous or periodic
      monitoring
   o  Third priority - Recommended for application-dependent monitoring

   This memo is based on information consistency tests and resulting
   indicators defined by ETSI [ETSI] and defines a new block type to
   augment those defined in Freidman, et al. [RFC3611] for use with
   MPEG2 Transport Stream (TS) [ISO-IEC.13818-1.2007].  The new block
   type supports reporting of the number of occurrences of each Program
   Specific Information (PSI) dependent indicator in the first and
   second priorities that supplements information from PSI independent
   Decodability Statistics Metrics Block [PIDCB]; third priority
   indicators are not supported.

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block for
   use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   Monitoring Architectures [RFC6792] provides guideline for reporting
   block format using RTCP XR.  The new report block described in this
   memo is in compliance with the monitoring architecture specified in
   [RFC6792] and the Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390].

1.4.  Applicability

   These metrics are applicable to any type of RTP application that uses
   the MPEG2 TS standard format for multimedia data; for example, MPEG4
   over MPEG2 TS over RTP.  This new block type can be useful for
   measuring content stream or TS quality by checking TS header
   information [ETSI] and identifying the existence, and characterizing

   the severity, of bitstream packetization problems which may affect
   users' perception of a service delivered over RTP; it may also be
   useful for verifying the continued correct operation of an existing
   system management tool.


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  MPEG2 TS PSI dependent Decodability Statistics Metrics Block

   ETSI TR 101290 [ETSI] generally defines metrics related to error
   events while this document contains counts of those metrics defined
   in [ETSI].  The block defined in this document reports MPEG2 TS PSI
   dependent decodability statistics metrics beyond the information
   carried in the standard RTCP packet format and PSI independent
   Decodability Metrics Block[PIDCB], which are measured at the
   receiving end of the RTP stream.  It contains counts of six metrics
   defined in ETSI TR 101290 [ETSI].  Information is reported about
   basic monitoring parameters necessary to ensure that the TS can be
   decoded including:

   o  Program Association Table(PAT) errors
   o  PAT 2 errors
   o  Program Map Table(PMT) errors
   o  Packet Identifier(PID) errors

   and continuous monitoring parameters necessary to ensure the
   continuous decoding including:

   o  Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) errors
   o  Conditional Access Table (CAT) errors

   The other parameters are ignored since they do not apply to all MPEG2
   implementations.  For further information on these parameters, see
   [ETSI].

   The MPEG2 TS PSI dependent Decodability Metrics Block has the
   following format:

   block type (BT): 8 bits

      The MPEG2 TS PSI Dependent Decodability Metrics Block is
      identified by the constant <MTPDD>.

   Reserved: 8 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders
      ignored by receivers (See [RFC6709] section 4.2).

   block length: 16 bits

      The constant 11, in accordance with the definition of this field
      in Section 3 of RFC 3611.  The block MUST be discarded if the
      block length is set to a different value.

   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611.

   begin_seq: 16 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611.

Internet-Draft           RTCP XR TS Decodability               July 2013


   end_seq: 16 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611.

   PAT_error_count: 32 bits

      A count of the number of PAT errors that occurred in the above
      sequence number interval.  The program association table (PAT) is
      the only packet with packet ID (PID) Hex 0000.  A PAT error occurs
      when it does not occur at least every 0.5s, as defined in section
      5.2.1 of [ETSI].  Every program within the MPEG TS stream is
      listed in the PAT; if it is missing, then no programs can be
      decoded.

   PAT_error_2_count: 32 bits

      A count of the number of PAT2 errors that occurred in the above
      sequence number interval.  A PAT2 error occurs when the table has
      an ID other than Hex 00 or there is more than one table ID Hex 00
      inside the packet with the PAT PID, as defined in section 5.2.1 of
      [ETSI].

   PMT_error_count: 32 bits

      A count of the number of PMT_errors that occurred in the above
      sequence number interval.  A PMT_error occurs when the program map
      table (PMT) does not come up at least every 0.5s on the PID that
      is referred to in the PAT, as defined in the section 5.2.1 of
      [ETSI].

   PID_error_count: 32 bits

      A count of the number of PID_errors that occurred in the above
      sequence number interval.  A PID_error occurs when MPEG TS streams
      are remultiplexed and any PID doesn't refer to an actual data
      stream, as defined in the section 5.2.2 of [ETSI].

   CRC_error_count: 32 bits

      A count of the number of CRC_errors that occurred in the above
      sequence number interval.  A CRC_error occurs if data corruption
      occurred in any of the following tables -- CAT, PAT, PMT, Network
      Information Table(NIT), Event Information Table(EIT), Bouquet
      Association Table(BAT), Service Description Table(SDT) or Time
      Offset Table(TOT), as defined in the section 5.2.2 of [ETSI].

   CAT_error_count: 32 bits

      A count of the number of CAT_errors that occurred in the above
      sequence number interval.  A CAT_error occurs when the table has
      an ID other than Hex 01,as defined in the section 5.2.2 of [ETSI].



4.  SDP Signaling

   RFC 3611 defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of RTCP XR blocks.  However XR blocks
   MAY be used without prior signaling (See section 5 of RFC3611).

4.1.  SDP rtcp-xr-attrib Attribute Extension

   This session augments the SDP attribute "rtcp-xr" defined in Section
   5.1 of RFC 3611 by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   xr-format =/  xr-tpdd-block

   xr-tpdd-block = "ts-psi-dep-decodability"

4.2.  Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in offer-answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [RFC3611] for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters
   applies.  For detailed usage of Offer/Answer for unilateral
   parameter, refer to section 5.2 of [RFC3611].


5.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of RFC 3611.

5.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value MTPID in the IANA " RTP
   Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type Registry " to
   the "MPEG2 Transport Stream PSI dependent Decodability Statistics
   Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace MPITD with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]
