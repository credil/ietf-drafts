Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Feb 2013


1.  Introduction

   The number of cyber attacks is growing day by day, and incident
   information needs to be reported, exchanged, and shared among
   organizations in order to cope with the situation.  IODEF is one of
   the tools enabling such exchange, and is already in use.

   To efficiently run cybersecurity operations, these exchanged
   information needs to be machine-readable.  IODEF provides a
   structured means to describe the information, but it needs to embed
   various non-structured such information in order to convey detailed
   information.  Further structure within IODEF increases IODEF
   documents' machine-readability and thus facilitates streamlining
   cybersecurity operations.

   On the other hand, there exist various other activities facilitating
   detailed and structured description of cybersecurity information, as
   listed in Section 10.  Since such structured description facilitates
   cybersecurity operations, it would be beneficial to embed and convey
   these information inside IODEF document.

   To enable that, this document extends the IODEF to embed and convey
   various structured cybersecurity information, with which
   cybersecurity operations can be facilitated.  Since IODEF defines a
   flexible and extensible format and supports a granular level of
   specificity, this document defines an extension to IODEF instead of
   defining a new report format.  For clarity, and to eliminate
   duplication, only the additional structures necessary for describing
   the exchange of such structured information are provided.


2.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document follows the one defined in RFC
   5070 [RFC5070].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability

   To maintain cybersecurity, organization needs to exchange
   cybersecurity information, which includes the following information:
   attack pattern, platform information, vulnerability and weakness,
   countermeasure instruction, computer event log, and the severity.

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Feb 2013


   IODEF provides a scheme to describe and exchange such information
   among interested parties.  However, it does not define the detailed
   format to describe such information.

   On the other hand, there already exist structured and detailed
   formats for describing those information and facilitating such
   exchange.  Major of them are listed in Section 10.  By embedding them
   into the IODEF document, the document can convey more detailed
   contents to the receivers, and the document can be easily reused.

   These structured cybersecurity information facilitates cybersecurity
   operation at the receiver side.  Since the information is machine-
   readable, the data can be processed by computers.  That expedites the
   automation of cybersecurity operations

   For instance, an organization wishing to report a security incident
   wants to describe what vulnerability was exploited.  Then the sender
   can simply use IODEF, where an XML [XML1.0]-based attack pattern
   record that follows the syntax and vocabulary defined by an industry
   specification is embedded instead of describing everything in free
   format text.  Receiver can identify the needed details of the attack
   pattern by looking up some of the XML tags defined by the
   specification.  Receiver can accumulate the attack pattern record in
   its database and could distribute it to the interested parties if
   needed, without needing human interventions.

   Another example is that, when an administrator wishes to check the
   configuration of host computers in his organization, he may send a
   query to host computers, which may automatically generate XML-based
   software configuration information upon receiving thequery by running
   a software and may embed that to an IODEF document, which is then
   sent back to the administrator.


4.  Extension Definition

   This draft extends IODEF to embed structured cybersecurity
   information by introducing new classes, with which these information
   can be embedded inside IODEF document as element contents of
   AdditionalData and RecordItem classes.

4.1.  IANA Table for Structured Cybersecurity Information

   This extension embeds structured cybersecurity information defined by
   the other specifications.  The list of supported specifications is
   managed by IANA, and this draft defines the needed field for the
   list's entry.




Takahashi, et al.        Expires August 16, 2013                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Feb 2013


   Each entry has namespace [XMLNames], specification name, version,
   reference URI, and applicable classes for each specification.
   Arbitrary URIs that may help readers to understand the specification
   could be embedded inside the Reference URI field, but it is
   recommended that standard/informational URI describing the
   specification is prepared and is embedded here.

   The initial IANA table has only one entry, as below.



     Namespace:          http://xml/metadataSharing.xsd
     Specification Name: Malware Metadata Exchange Format
     Version:            1.2
     Reference URI:      http://standards.ieee.org/develop/
                         indconn/icsg/mmdef.html
     Applicable Classes: AttackPattern


   The table is to be managed by IANA using the Expert Review [RFC5226]
   and Specification Required [RFC5226] allocation policies as further
   specified in Section 7.

   The SpecID attributes of extended classes (Section 4.3) must allow
   the values of the specifications' namespace fields, but otherwise,
   implementations are not required to support all specifications of the
   IANA table and may choose which specifications to support, though the
   specification listed in the initial table needs to be minimally
   supported, as described in Section 5.  In case an implementation
   received a data it does not support, it may expand its functionality
   by looking up the IANA table or notify the sender of its inability to
   parse the data by using any means defined outside the scope of this
   specification.

4.2.  Extended Data Type: XMLDATA

   This extension inherits all of the data types defined in the IODEF
   model.  One data type is added: XMLDATA.  An embedded XML data is
   represented by the XMLDATA data type.  This type is defined as the
   extension to the iodef:ExtensionType [RFC5070], whose dtype attribute
   is set to "xml."

4.3.  Extended Classes

   The IODEF Incident element [RFC5070] is summarized below.  It is
   expressed in Unified Modeling Language (UML) syntax as used in the
   IODEF specification.  The UML representation is for illustrative
   purposes only; elements are specified in XML as defined in Appendix

                         Figure 1: Incident class

   This extension defines the following seven elements.

4.3.1.  AttackPattern

   An AttackPattern consists of an extension to the
   Incident.Method.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml".  The
   extension describes attack patterns of incidents or events.

   It is recommended that Method class SHOULD contain one or more of the
   extension elements whenever available.

   An AttackPattern class is structured as follows.


   +------------------------+
   | AttackPattern          |
   +------------------------+
   | ENUM SpecID            |<>--(0..*)-[ RawData ]
   | STRING ext-SpecID      |<>--(0..*)-[ Reference ]
   | STRING AttackPatternID |<>--(0..*)-[ Platform ]
   +------------------------+


                       Figure 2: AttackPattern class

   This class has the following attributes.

   SpecID:  REQUIRED.  ENUM.  A specification's identifier that
      specifies the format of a structured cybersecurity information.
      The value should be chosen from the namespaces [XMLNames] listed
      in the IANA table (Section 4.1) or "private".  The value "private"
      is prepared for conveying RawData based on a format that is not
      listed in the table.  This is usually used for conveying data
      formatted according to an organization's private schema.  When the
      value "private" is used, ext-SpecID element MUST be used.

   ext-SpecID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  A specification's identifier that
      specifies the format of a structured cybersecurity information.
      When this element is used, the value of SpecID element must be
      "private."

   AttackPatternID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An identifier of an attack
      pattern to be reported.  This attribute SHOULD be used whenever
      such identifier is available.  Both RawData and Reference elements
      MUST NOT be used when this attribute is used, while either of them
      MUST be used if this attribute is omitted.

   The AttackPattern class is composed of the following aggregate
   classes.

   RawData:  Zero or more.  XMLDATA.  A complete document that is
      formatted according to the specification and its version
      identified by the SpecID/ext-SpecID.  When this element is used,
      writers/senders MUST ensure that the namespace specified by
      SpecID/ext-SpecID and the one used in the RawData element are
      consistent; if not, the namespace identified by SpecID SHOULD be

      prefered, and the inconsistency SHOULD be logged so a human can
      correct the problem.

   Reference:  Zero or more of iodef:Reference [RFC5070].  This element
      allows an IODEF document to include a link to a structured
      information instead of directly embedding it into a RawData
      element.

   Platform:  Zero or more.  An identifier of software platform involved
      in the specific attack pattern, which is elaborated in
      Section 4.3.2.

4.3.2.  Platform

   A Platform identifies a software platform.  It is recommended that
   AttackPattern, Vulnerability, Weakness, and System classes contain
   this elements whenever available.

   A Platform element is structured as follows.


   +----------------------+
   | Platform             |
   +----------------------+
   | ENUM SpecID          |<>--(0..*)-[ RawData ]
   | STRING ext-SpecID    |<>--(0..*)-[ Reference ]
   | STRING PlatformID    |
   +----------------------+


                         Figure 3: Platform class

   This class has the following attributes.

   SpecID:  REQUIRED.  ENUM.  The meaning of this attribute is the same
      as that of the AttackPattern class (Section 4.3.1).

   ext-SpecID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  The meaning of this attribute is the
      same as that of the AttackPattern class (Section 4.3.1).

   PlatformID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An identifier of a platform to be
      reported.  This attribute SHOULD be used whenever such identifier
      is available.  Both RawData and Reference elements MUST NOT be
      used when this attribute is used, while either of them MUST be
      used if this attribute is omitted.

   This class is composed of the following aggregate classes.

      same as that of the AttackPattern class (Section 4.3.1).

   Reference:  Zero or more of iodef:Reference [RFC5070].  The meaning
      of this element is the same as that of the AttackPattern class
      (Section 4.3.1).

4.3.3.  Vulnerability

   A Vulnerability consists of an extension to the
   Incident.Method.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml".  The
   extension describes the (candidate) vulnerabilities of incidents or
   events.

   It is recommended that Method class SHOULD contain one or more of the
   extension elements whenever available.

   A Vulnerability element is structured as follows.


   +------------------------+
   | Vulnerability          |
   +------------------------+
   | ENUM SpecID            |<>--(0..*)-[ RawData ]

                       Figure 4: Vulnerability class

   This class has the following attributes.

   SpecID:  REQUIRED.  ENUM.  The meaning of this attribute is the same
      as that of the AttackPattern class (Section 4.3.1).

   ext-SpecID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  The meaning of this attribute is the
      same as that of the AttackPattern class (Section 4.3.1).

   VulnerabilityID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An identifier of a
      vulnerability to be reported.  This attribute SHOULD be used
      whenever such identifier is available.  Both RawData and Reference
      elements MUST NOT be used when this attribute is used, while
      either of them MUST be used if this attribute is omitted.

   This class is composed of the following aggregate classes.

   RawData:  Zero or more.  XMLDATA.  The meaning of this element is the
      same as that of the AttackPattern class (Section 4.3.1).

   Reference:  Zero or more of iodef:Reference [RFC5070].  The meaning
      of this element is the same as that of the AttackPattern class
      (Section 4.3.1).

   Platform:  Zero or more.  An identifier of software platform affected
      by the vulnerability, which is elaborated in Section 4.3.2.

   Scoring:  Zero or more.  An indicator of the severity of the
      vulnerability, such as CVSS and CCSS scores, which is elaborated
      in Section 4.3.4.  Some of the structured information may include
      scores within it.  In this case, the Scoring element SHOULD NOT be
      used since the RawData element contains the scores.  If a reader/
      receiver detects scores in both RawData and Scoring elements and
      their inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the scores derived from the
      RawData element, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can
      correct the problem.

4.3.4.  Scoring

   A Scoring class describes the scores of the severity in terms of
   security.  It is recommended that Vulnerability and Weakness classes
   contain the elements whenever available.

   A Scoring class is structured as follows.


   +----------------------+
   | Scoring              |
   +----------------------+
   | ENUM SpecID          |<>---------[ ScoreSet ]
   | STRING ext-SpecID    |
   +----------------------+


                          Figure 5: Scoring class

   This class has two attributes.

   SpecID:  REQUIRED.  ENUM.  The meaning of this attribute is the same
      as that of the AttackPattern class (Section 4.3.1).

   ext-SpecID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  The meaning of this attribute is the
      same as that of the AttackPattern class (Section 4.3.1).

   This class is composed of an aggregate class.

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Feb 2013


   ScoreSet:  One. XMLDATA.  A complete document that is formatted
      according to the specification and its version identified by the
      SpecID/ext-SpecID.  This element includes a set of score
      information.  When this element is used, writers/senders MUST
      ensure that the namespace specified by SpecID/ext-SpecID and the
      one used in the RawData element are consistent; if not, the
      namespace identified by SpecID SHOULD be prefered, and the
      inconsistency SHOULD be logged so a human can correct the problem.

   Writers/senders MUST ensure the specification name and version
   identified by the SpecID are consistent with the contents of the
   Score; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD
   prefer the specification name and version derived from the content,
   and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

4.3.5.  Weakness

   A Weakness consists of an extension to the
   Incident.Method.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml".  The
   extension describes the weakness types of incidents or events.

   It is recommended that Method class SHOULD contain one or more of the
   extension elements whenever available.

   A Weakness element is structured as follows.


   +----------------------+
   | Weakness             |
   +----------------------+
   | ENUM SpecID          |<>--(0..*)-[ RawData ]
   | STRING ext-SpecID    |<>--(0..*)-[ Reference ]
   | STRING WeaknessID    |<>--(0..*)-[ Platform ]
   |                      |<>--(0..*)-[ Scoring ]
   +----------------------+


                         Figure 6: Weakness class

   This class has the following attributes.

   SpecID:  REQUIRED.  ENUM.  The meaning of this attribute is the same
      as that of the AttackPattern class (Section 4.3.1).

   ext-SpecID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  The meaning of this attribute is the
      same as that of the AttackPattern class (Section 4.3.1).

   WeaknessID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An identifier of a weakness to be
      reported.  This attribute SHOULD be used whenever such identifier
      is available/ Both RawData and Reference elements MUST NOT be used
      when this attribute is used, while either of them MUST be used if
      this attribute is omitted.

   This class is composed of the following aggregate classes.

   RawData:  Zero or more.  XMLDATA.  The meaning of this element is the
      same as that of the AttackPattern class (Section 4.3.1).

   Reference:  Zero or more of iodef:Reference [RFC5070].  The meaning
      of this element is the same as that of the AttackPattern class
      (Section 4.3.1).

   Platform:  Zero or more.  An identifier of software platform affected
      by the weakness, which is elaborated in Section 4.3.2.

   Scoring:  Zero or more.  An indicator of the severity of the
      weakness, such as CWSS score, which is elaborated in
      Section 4.3.4.

4.3.6.  EventReport

   An EventReport consists of an extension to the
   Incident.EventData.Record.RecordData.RecordItem element with a dtype
   of "xml".  The extension embeds structured event reports.

   It is recommended that RecordItem class SHOULD contain one or more of
   the extension elements whenever available.

   An EventReport element is structured as follows.


   +----------------------+
   | EventReport          |
   +----------------------+
   | ENUM SpecID          |<>--(0..*)-[ RawData ]
   | STRING ext-SpecID    |<>--(0..*)-[ Reference ]
   | STRING EventID       |

   EventID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An identifier of an event to be
      reported.  This attribute SHOULD be used whenever such identifier
      is available.  Both RawData and Reference elements MUST NOT be
      used when this attribute is used, while either of them MUST be
      used if this attribute is omitted.

   This class is composed of three aggregate classes.

   RawData:  Zero or more.  XMLDATA.  The meaning of this element is the
      same as that of the AttackPattern class (Section 4.3.1).

   Reference:  Zero or more of iodef:Reference [RFC5070].  The meaning
      of this element is the same as that of the AttackPattern class
      (Section 4.3.1).

   This class MUST contain at least one of RawData or Reference
   elements.  Writers/senders MUST ensure the specification name and
   version identified by the SpecID are consistent with the contents of
   the RawData; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD
   prefer the specification name and version derived from the content,
   and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

4.3.7.  Verifcation

   A Verification consists of an extension to the
   Incident.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml".  The extension
   elements describes incident on vefifying incidents.

   A Verification class is structured as follows.

   elements.  Writers/senders MUST ensure the specification name and
   version identified by the SpecID are consistent with the contents of
   the RawData; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD
   prefer the specification name and version derived from the content,
   and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

4.3.8.  Remediation

   A Remediation consists of an extension to the Incident.AdditionalData
   element with a dtype of "xml".  The extension elements describes
   incident remediation information including instructions.

   the RawData; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD
   prefer the specification name and version derived from the content,
   and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.


5.  Mandatory to Implement features

   The implementation of this draft MUST be capable of sending and
   receiving the XML conforming to the specification listed in the
   initial IANA table described in Section 4.1 without error.

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Feb 2013


   The receiver MUST be capable of validating received XML documents
   that are embedeed inside that against their schemata.  Note that the
   receiver can look up the namespace in the IANA table to understand
   what specifications the embedded XML documents follows.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a format for encoding a particular class of
   security incidents appropriate for exchange across organizations.  As
   merely a data representation, it does not directly introduce security
   issues.  However, it is guaranteed that parties exchanging instances
   of this specification will have certain concerns.  For this reason,
   the underlying message format and transport protocol used MUST ensure
   the appropriate degree of confidentiality, integrity, and
   authenticity for the specific environment.

   Organizations that exchange data using this document are URGED to
   develop operating procedures that document the following areas of
   concern.

6.1.  Transport-Specific Concerns

   The underlying messaging format and protocol used to exchange
   instances of the IODEF MUST provide appropriate guarantees of
   confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.  The use of a
   standardized security protocol is encouraged.  The Real-time Inter-
   network Defense (RID) protocol [RFC6045] and its associated transport
   binding [RFC6046] provide such security.

   The critical security concerns are that these structured information
   may be falsified or they may become corrupt during transit.  In areas
   where transmission security or secrecy is questionable, the
   application of a digital signature and/or message encryption on each
   report will counteract both of these concerns.  We expect that each
   exchanging organization will determine the need, and mechanism, for
   transport protection.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemata
   [XMLschemaPart1] [XMLschemaPart2] conforming to a registry mechanism
   described in [RFC3688].

   Registration request for the IODEF structured cybersecurity

      Allocation Policy: Expert Review [RFC5226] and Specification
      Required [RFC5226].

   The Designated Expert is expected to consult with the mile (Managed
   Incident Lightweight Exchange) working group or its successor if any
   such WG exists (e.g., via email to the working group's mailing list).
   The Designated Expert is expected to retrieve the SCI specification
   from the provided URI in order to check the public availability of
   the specification and verify the correctness of the URI.  An
   important responsibility of the Designated Expert is to ensure that
   the registered Applicable Classes are appropriate for the registered
   SCI specification.

11.  Appendix III: An XML Example

   This section provides an example of an incident encoded in the IODEF.
   This do not necessarily represent the only way to encode a particular
   incident.  This example reports an attack to a CSIRT and is extended
   from the example described in [RFC5070].  It uses identifiers whose
   dictionary follows CVE 1.0 schema, and it aembeds XML following CEE
   0.6.
