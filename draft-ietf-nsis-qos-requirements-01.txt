Mobile IP ensures correct routing of packets to a mobile node as the
mobile node changes its point of attachment to the
Internet.  However, it is also required to provide proper Quality of
Service (QoS) forwarding treatment to the mobile node's packet stream
at the intermediate nodes in the network, so that QoS-sensitive IP
services can be supported over Mobile IP.  This document describes
requirements for an IP QoS mechanism for its satisfactory operation
with Mobile IP.
