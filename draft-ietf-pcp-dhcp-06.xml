      <t>This document defines DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2131"></xref> and

      provision PCP Server <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref> names.
      Motivations for expressing the PCP option as a textual string rather
      than a 32 or 128-bit binary address are discussed in <xref

      <t>In order to make use of these options, this document assumes

      <t>This document makes use of the following terms:<?rfc subcompact="yes" ?></t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>PCP Server denotes a functional element which receives and
          processes PCP requests from a PCP Client. A PCP Server can be
          co-located with or be separated from the function (e.g., NAT,
          Firewall) it controls. Refer to <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref>.</t>

          <t>PCP Client denotes a PCP software instance responsible for
          issuing PCP requests to a PCP Server. Refer to <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref>.</t>

          <t>DHCP refers to both DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2131"></xref> and
          DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>.</t>

          <t>DHCP client (or client) denotes a node that initiates requests to
          obtain configuration parameters from one or more DHCP servers.</t>

          <t>DHCP server (or server) refers to a node that responds to
          requests from DHCP clients.</t>

          <t>Name is a UTF-8 <xref target="RFC3629"></xref> string that can be
          passed to getaddrinfo (Section 6.1 of <xref
          target="RFC3493"></xref>), such as a DNS name, address literals,
          etc. The name MUST NOT contain spaces or nulls. A name may be a
          fully qualified domain name (e.g., "myservice.example.com."), IPv4
          address in dotted-decimal form (e.g., 192.0.2.33) or textual

    <section anchor="rationale" title="Rationale">
      <t>The pcp WG consensus is to define a DHCP option which contains a
      string that can be passed to APIs (e.g., getaddrinfo()). In particular,
      the option should be designed to include a name (e.g., domain name <xref
      target="RFC2181"></xref>) or IP address literal string. In such design,
      DHCP clients are expected to pass the conveyed string to any supported
      name resolution library (DNS is a name resolution service among others).
      The underlying name resolution library is responsible for validating the
      name.</t>

      <t>Distinct IP-Address and Name DHCP options have been considered in
      early stages of this specification. This flexibility aims to let service
      providers make their own engineering choices and use the most convenient
      option according to their deployment context. Nevertheless, the DHC WG's
      position is this flexibility has some drawbacks such as inducing errors
      (See Section 7 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines"></xref>). Therefore, only the
      Name option is maintained within this document.</t>

      <t>This choice is motivated by operational considerations: In
      particular, some Service Providers are considering two levels of
      redirection:</t>

      <t><?rfc subcompact="yes" ?><list style="format (%d)">
          <t>The first level is national-wise and undertaken by DHCP: a
          regional-specific Name will be returned;</t>

          <t>The second level is done during the resolution of the
          regional-specific Name to redirect the customer to a regional PCP
          server among a pool deployed regionally.</t>
        </list><?rfc subcompact="no" ?></t>

      <t></t>

      <t>Distinct operational teams are responsible for each of the above
      mentioned levels. A clear separation between the functional perimeter of
      each team is a sensitive task for the maintenance of the offered
      services. Regional teams will require to introduce new resources (e.g.,
      new PCP-controlled devices such as Carrier Grade NATs (CGNs, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements"></xref>)) to meet an increase
      in customer base. Operations related to the introduction of these new
      devices (e.g., addressing, redirection, etc.) are implemented locally.
      Having this regional separation provides flexibility to manage portions
      of network operated by dedicated teams. This two-level redirection can
      not be met by the IP Address option.</t>

      <t>In addition to the operational considerations:<?rfc subcompact="yes" ?><list
          style="symbols">
          <t>The use of the Name for NAT64 <xref target="RFC6146"></xref>
          might be suitable for load-balancing purposes;</t>

          <t>For the DS-Lite case <xref target="RFC6333"></xref>, if the
          encapsulation mode is used to send PCP messages, an IP address may
          be used since the AFTR selection is already done via the AFTR_NAME
          DHCPv6 option <xref target="RFC6334"></xref>. Of course, this
          assumes that the PCP Server is co-located with the AFTR function. If
          these functions are not co-located, conveying the Name would be more
          convenient.</t>

        <t>The approach adopted in this document allows for an IP address or a
        Name to be returned in the specified DHCP option. In particular, a
        server can resolve first the name and return in the option the
        resolved IP address(es). For deployments where this is not possible,
        the server can return a name which will be resolved by the host
        embedding the client. This document does not have any requirement on
        the underlying name resolution library (in particular, DNS is not
        assumed as the only available name resolution service). </t>

        <t>Returning a Name requires the host to embed a name resolution
        service. Some may present this as an argument against defining a Name
        option. Nevertheless, this argument may be objected as implementing a
        name resolution library (e.g., embed a DNS resolver) is cheap and
        devices which don't embed DNS resolver are uncommon.</t>
