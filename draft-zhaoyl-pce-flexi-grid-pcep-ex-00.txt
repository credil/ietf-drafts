PCEP Protocol Extension for spectrum utilization optimization in Flexi-
                             Grid Networks
                 draft-zhaoyl-pce-flexi-grid-pcep-ex-00

Abstract

   Flexi-grid networks overcomes the fixed grid channel of Wavelength
   Switched Optical Network(WSON) by flexible spectrum to allow non-
   uniform and dynamic allocation of spectrum based on the demand of the
   incoming services' LSP.  Flexi-grid networks is an effective solution
   to solve the problem of efficient spectrum utilization.

   Because the client LSP needs to be assigned contiguous spectrum in
   flexi-grid networks, there will be two problems that would affect
   spectrum utilization, i.e.  RSA and fragmentation.  We introduce two
   kinds of methods which can improve the spectrum utilization further,
   and some related PCEP extensions are defined in this document.

1.  Introduction

   Demand of traffic is increasing exponentially and already approaching
   the limit of single mode fiber capacity.  At the same time, because
   of varying demand of traffic, we need an efficient and agile
   utilization of the optical spectrum.

   ITU-T Study Group 15 introduce a new flexi-grid networks to enable
   dynamic allocation of spectrum resource.  The flexi-grid networks is
   an effective solution to solve the problem of efficient spectrum
   resource utilization.

   The granularity of flexi-grid networks can be smaller and agile.
   i.e.,6.25GHz.  In the flexi-grid networks, the appropriate size of
   spectrum is determined by the used modulation format.According to the
   client data rate LSP and physical consecutives of the selected
   path,the appropriate size of spectrum is adaptively allocated to
   optical connections by assigning the appropriate number of contiguous
   spectrum from end-to-end.Before assigning the client LSP, we have to
   find suitable route and fit contiguous spectrum for it, and it is a
   complex process.  So spectrum utilization is very important in RSA.
   While there are several algorithms for RSA, flexi-grid networks
   require to extend PCEP protocol to support different algorithms
   seletion.

   Upon tearing down of connections, the allocated spectrum are released
   for future LSPs.  In a dynamic traffic scenario, this setup and tear
   down precedure for a channel leads to fragmentation of spectral
   resources.  Due to the fragmentation, the available spectrum is
   divided into small noncontiguous spectral bands,the spectral
   effciency in the network is compromised.  Therefore the probability
   of finding suffcient contiguous spectrum for a connection is
   decreased.  We introduce defragmentation to deal with fragmentation
   in flexi-grid networks. then PCEP protocol has to add some messages
   to support them.

   WSON:Wavelength Switched Optical Network


4.  RSA

4.1.  Introduction of RSA

   In this part, we focus on the routing and spectrum assignment (RSA)
   problem.  This problem can be partitioned into two subproblems: (1)
   routing and (2) spectrum assignment, and each subproblem can be
   solved separately.  Different from traditional WDM network, flexi-
   grid networks assign continuous spectrum for new arrival LSP.  Static
   planning models are used for flexi-grid networks to improve spectrum
   utilization.

4.2.  Algorithms of RSA

   There are several spectrum assignment algorithms.

   (1)Random Fit (RF)

   This scheme first searches the space of spectrum to determine the set
   of all spectrum that are available on the required route.  Among the
   available spectrum, one is chosen randomly.

   (2)First-Fit (FF)

   In this scheme, all spectrum is numbered.When searching for available
   spectrum, a lower numbered spectrum is considered before a higher-
   numbered spectrum.The first available spectrum is then selected.
   Compared to Random spectrum assignment, the computation cost of this
   scheme is lower because there is no need to search the entire
   spectrum space for each route.

   (3)Least-Used (LU)/SPREAD

   LU selects the spectrum that is the least used in the network,
   thereby attempting to balance the load among all the spectrum.  The
   performance of LU is worse than Random, while also introducing
   additional communication overhead (e.g., global information is
   required to compute the least-used spectrum).

   (4)Most-Used (MU)/PACK

   MU is the opposite of LU in that it attempts to select the most-used
   spectrum in the network.  The communication overhead, storage, and
   computation cost are all similar to those in LU.MU also slightly
   outperforms FF, doing a better job of packing connections into fewer

   spectrum and conserving the spare capacity of less-used spectrum.

   (5)Min-Product (MP)

   MU is the opposite of LU works.  In a single fiber network, MP
   becomes FF.  The goal of MP is to pack spectrum into fibers, thereby
   minimizing the number of fibers in the network.

   (6)Least-Loaded (LL)

   The LL heuristic, like MP, is also designed for multi-fiber networks.
   This heuristic selects the spectrum that has the largest residual
   capacity on the most loaded link along route.

   (7)MAX-SUM (MS)

   MS was proposed for multi-fiber networks but it can also be applied
   to the single-fiber case.MS considers all possible paths in the
   network and attempts to maximize the remaining path capacities after
   lightpath establishment.

   (8)Relative Capacity Loss (RCL)

   RCL is based on MS.  RCL chooses spectrum to minimize the relative
   capacity loss.  RCL is based on the observation that minimizing total
   capacity loss sometimes does not lead to the best choice of spectrum.

   (9)Spectrum Reservation (Rsv)

   In Rsv, a given spectrum on a specified link is reserved for a
   traffic stream, usually a multihop stream.  This scheme reduces the
   blocking for multihop traffic,while increasing the blocking for
   connections that traverse only one fiber link (single-hop traffic).

   (10)Protecting Threshold (Thr)

   In Thr, a single-hop connection is assigned spectrum only if the
   number of idle spectrum on the link is at or above a given threshold.

4.3.  RSA Schemes Selection

   There are several spectrum assignment algorithms, we have to choose
   one of them for flexi-grid networks.  Different RSA schemes are
   selected according to diffrent network condition.  The PCEP protocol
   needs to extend a bit that shows different schemes selected.

5.  Defragmentation

5.1.  Motivation of Defragmentation

   New arrival of LSPs are then either forced to utilize more spectrum
   in the network or blocked in spite of suffcient spectrum being
   available.  Additionally, as the network evolves, a current optimal
   routing scheme might no longer provide the optimal spectral
   utilization over time.  There is an increasing demand from the
   network operators to be able to periodically reconfigure the network
   and return it to its optimal state, so that the network can operate
   more effciently.

5.2.   Definition of Defragmentation

   There is an operation defined as network defragmentation to solve
   above problem.  Reducing the blocking by consolidating the available
   network resources, this operation will also enable better network
   maintenance and more effcient network restoration and bandwidth
   adjustment.

5.3.   Application Scene of Defragmentation

   The process of defragmentation: (1) select LSP for defragmentation,
   and interrupt it considerring the time and cost, (2) choose forward
   spectrum in original route or new route, (3) move the LSP on possible
   spectrum.

   An example of defragentation is as following: A,B,C are client LSPs
   on link l, l1 is original statement of link l,l2 is statement of link
   l after defragementation.


                +-------------+          +----+     +---------+
           l1:  |     A       |          | B  |     |   C     |
                +-------------+----------+----+-----+---------+--
                +-------------+----+-----------+
           l2:  |     A       | B  |    C      |
                +-------------+----+-----------+-----



                      Fig.1 Defragentation principle

   we first focus on the problem of the time-point when should
   defragmentation be operated.  There is two ways to solve this
   problem.  One way is new arrival LSPs have no sufficient spectrum to
   bear, then cause blocked in the network.  The other way: (1) collect

   the information about occupation of spectrum fragments in a link or
   in the network, (2) introduce a notation to describe the state of
   spectrum fragment in a link or in a network, (3)when the size of this
   notation reaches an assumed threshold, it is the time for
   defragmentation.

   we consider the methods of defragmentation.  At present, there is two
   methods for defragmentation.  First is change route of client LSP,
   meaning that the spectrum of this LSP in new route is ahead than the
   spectrum in original route.  Second is the LSP move forward directly
   in original route.


6.  PCEP Protocol Extension

6.1.  PCEP Protocol Extension for RSA

   The PCEP protocol need to be extended to support the algorithms
   choosing of RSA.  PCReq needs to add RAEO-list information.  This
   information include "Algorithm Id", which stands for the number of
   different algorithms, and "Pri" that means priority of these
   algorithms.

6.2.  PCEP Protocol Extension for Defragmentation

   The presence of defragmentation in flexi-grid networks has an impact
   on the information that needs to be transferred by the control plane
   and PCE.  Defragmentation has to interrupt the traffic and move it to
   another spectrum or route.  The PCEP protocol needs to be extended
   two messages to support defragmentation, ingcluding information of
   orginal route/spectrum and present route/spectrum, when to stop
   defragmentation and so on.

   Here is Spectrum Defragmentation Request Message and Spectrum
   Defragmentation Reply Message.  "Target Clutter Value" stands for the
   goal of defragmentation.  "R" means whether the network MUST make it.
