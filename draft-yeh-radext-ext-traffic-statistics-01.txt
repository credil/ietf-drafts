Internet-Draft        RADIUS Accounting Extensions          October 2011


1.  Introduction

   RADIUS has been widely used as the centralized Authentication and
   Authorization management method for the service provision to the
   users in Broadband network.  [RFC3162], [RFC4818] and
   [ietf-radext-ipv6-access-05] has specified some attributes to support
   the service provision of IPv6-only and dual-stack.  Radius is also a
   protocol for carrying accounting information between a Network Access
   Server and a shared accounting server.  In the scenarios of dual-
   stack or any other IPv6 transition use case, such as DS-Lite, 6rd or
   the potential 4rd, there is a demand to report the separated IPv4 &
   IPv6 traffic statistics for the differential accounting and traffic
   recording.

   [BBF TR-187] (Edited by ALU & Cisco), which dedicates for the network
   architecture models and elements requirements in the PPPoE scenario
   to support IPv6-only or dual stack for Internet access service, has
   expressed this demand in its section 9.4.  The explicit texts are as
   follows:

      The BNG must also be able to support separate queues for IPv4 and
      IPv6 traffic, as they may be used to offer IPv4 and IPv6 services
      with different policies.

      Note that BNG of BBF is a kind of NAS of IETF.

      R-60 The BNG MUST support forwarding IPv6 and IPv4 traffic in
      common traffic classes.

      R-61 The BNG MUST support forwarding IPv6 and IPv4 traffic in
      separate traffic classes.

      R-64 The BNG MUST support input and output octet counters that are
      separate for both IPv6 and IPv4 traffic.

      R-65 The BNG MUST support input and output packet counters that
      are separate for both IPv6 and IPv4 traffic.

   Per the section 9.4 of BBF TR-187, the NAS is required to support
   separate queues and counters for IPv4 or IPv6 traffic, and the Radius
   attributes of Acct-Input-Octets, Acct-Output-Octets, Acct-Input-
   Packets, Acct-Output-Packets are recommended to use for the
   combination traffic.  That means some new RADIUS attributes is
   required to report the separated IPv4 or IPv6 traffic statistics.

   [draft-maglione-radext-ipv6-acct-extensions-01] (Edited by Telecom
   Italia, Ericsson & Magyar Telekom) tries to define the following
   attributes:

      IPv6-Acct-Input-Octets
      IPv6-Acct-Output-Octets
      IPv6-Acct-Input-Packets
      IPv6-Acct-Output-Packets
      IPv6-Acct-Input-Gigawords
      IPv6-Acct-Output-Gigawords

   for the collecting of IPv6 traffic statistics in RADIUS accounting
   messages. [draft-hu-v6ops-radius-issues-ipv6-00] (Edited by China
   Telecom & ZTE) presents the same issue on the accounting for dual-
   stack traffic statistics, but it sounds like limit to the PPP case.
   [draft-winter-radext-fancyaccounting-00] also shows the interest to
   define a group of attributes to report the statistics for various
   traffic classes, but tries to use the extended type space.  And
   [draft-yeh-radext-dual-stack-access-02] (Edited Huawei) tries to use
   the traditional format defined in [RFC2865], [RFC2866] and [RFC2869]
   to extend some new attributes:

      Acct-Input-IPv4-Octets
      Acct-Output-IPv4-Octets
      Acct-Input-IPv4-Packets
      Acct-Output-IPv4-Packets
      Acct-Input-IPv4-Gigawords
      Acct-Output-IPv4-Gigawords
      Acct-Input-IPv6-Octets
      Acct-Output-IPv6-Octets
      Acct-Input-IPv6-Packets
      Acct-Output-IPv6-Packets
      Acct-Input-IPv6-Gigawords
      Acct-Output-IPv6-Gigawords

   against the dual-stack case for traffic statistics reporting in
   RADIUS.

   [draft-ietf-radext-radius-extensions-02], which is already in the
   phase of WGLC, has extended the type space of RADIUS attribute and
   defined the new formats for the extended type attributes with some
   new data types.  That might means the type code in the new extended
   space will be used to define a new attribute, if it is agreed to move
   the 'Unassigned' code space (from 144 to 191) to be 'Deprecated'.

   This document tries to use both the traditional format defined in
   [RFC2865] and the new format defined in
   [draft-ietf-radext-radius-extensions-02] for the extension of IPv4
   and IPv6 traffic statistics, and let the WG decides which one is more
   suitable for the cases mentioned here.

2.  Terminology and Language

   This document describes some new RADIUS attributes and the associated
   usage on NAS and AAA server.  This document should be read in
   conjunction with the relevant RADIUS specifications, including
   [RFC2865], [RFC2866], [RFC2869], and
   [draft-ietf-radext-radius-extensions-02], for a complete mechanism.
   Definitions for terms and acronyms not specifically defined in this
   document are defined in RFC2865, RFC2866, RFC2869, and
   [draft-ietf-radext-radius-extensions-02].

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

   reporting for the dual-stack users.

   transition cases, such as DS-Lite, 6rd or the potential 4rd.

   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

   0    This attribute MUST NOT be present.
   0+   Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present.
   0-1  Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present.
   1    Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present.
   1+   One or more of these attributes MUST be present.


6.  Security Considerations

   Security issues related RADIUS are described in section 8 of RFC2865
   and section 5 of RFC3162.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign 8 new attribute types code in the "Radius
   Types" registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types for the
   following attributes:

      Acct-Input-IPv4-Octets
      Acct-Output-IPv4-Octets
      Acct-Input-IPv4-Packets
      Acct-Output-IPv4-Packets
      Acct-Input-IPv6-Octets
      Acct-Output-IPv6-Octets
      Acct-Input-IPv6-Packets
      Acct-Output-IPv6-Packets

   IANA should allocate these codes from the standardized type space of
   the RADIUS attributes using the "IETF Review" policy [RFC5226].
