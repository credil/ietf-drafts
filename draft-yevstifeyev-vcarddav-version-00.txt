1. Introduction

   vCard is used to represent and exchange a variety of information
   about individuals and other entities (e.g., formatted and structured
   name and delivery addresses, email address, multiple telephone
   numbers, photograph, logo, audio clips, etc.).  The most current
   vCard specification is RFC 6350 [RFC6350], that defines version 4.0
   of vCard.  However, a number of other vCard versions existed prior to
   publication of RFC 6350.

   vCard entity is capable of carrying information about its version in
   the VERSION property.  The purpose of this document is to register
   all existing vCard versions as VERSION property values in the
   corresponding registry set up by RFC 6350.  It also clarifies the
   generic syntax of VERSION property and contains guidelines on its use
   in vCard entities that conform to different vCard versions.

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. vCard VERSION Property

2.1. Generic Syntax

   The VERSION property was first introduced in vCard 2.1 [VCARD21], and
   continued to be used in vCard 3.0 [RFC2426] and vCard 4.0 [RFC6350]. 
   Each of the aforementioned specifications defined a separate syntax
   for VERSION property which is appropriate for use in vCard entities
   conformant to such specification, such as (from RFC 6350; ABNF

INTERNET DRAFT            vCard VERSION Values        September 17, 2011


   [RFC5234] is used):

     VERSION-value = "4.0"

   for VERSION property value of vCard 4.0.

   This document defines a simple generic syntax for VERSION property
   values, that is expressed using Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] in the <VERSION-value> production:

     VERSION-value = 1*DIGIT "." DIGIT

   where <DIGIT> is specified in RFC 5234 [RFC5234].  All subsequent
   versions of vCard MUST define VERSION property value syntax that is
   compatible with this document.

2.2. Use of VERSION Property

   As VERSION property was first introduced in vCard 2.1 [VCARD21],
   vCard 2.0 and vCard 1.0 did not contain such facility.  However, this
   document set up the rule that any vCard entity, independent of the
   version, SHOULD contain VERSION property, with the value conformant
   to syntax described in Section 2.1, and such property, if present,
   SHOULD be put after the BEGIN property.

2.3. Registration of VERSION Property Values

   Section 4 of this document registers VERSION property values for all
   existing vCard versions, beginning with vCard 1.0 and ending in vCard
   4.0.  Specifications of further versions of vCard are supposed to
   register their own version.

3. Security Considerations

   This document is not believed to affect security of vCard in any way.

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to add the following entries in the vCard Property
   Values registry created by RFC 6350:

               +----------+--------+-------------------------+
               | Property | Value  | Reference               |
               +----------+--------+-------------------------+
               | VERSION  | 1.0    | [VCARD10], [RFCXXXX]    |
               | VERSION  | 2.0    | [VCARD20], [RFCXXXX]    |
               | VERSION  | 2.1    | [VCARD21], [RFCXXXX]    |
               | VERSION  | 3.0    | [RFC2426], [RFCXXXX]    |
               | VERSION  | 4.0    | [RFC6350], [RFCXXXX]    |
