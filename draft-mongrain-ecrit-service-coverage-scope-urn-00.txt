Internet-Draft   Jurisdictional Scope for Service URN        March 2013


Abstract

   This document specifies a mechanism to specify a Service Coverage
   Scope in a Service URN [RFC5031] when multiple providers provide the
   same service for the same location.

1. Introduction

   For some given location, there may be multiple providers that supply
   the same given service.  These providers offer their services for
   different coverage areas.  For example, in the United States of
   America, both the city police and the state police handle emergency
   calls.  If one needs to reach the state police to request emergency
   assistance, a different Service URN is needed in order to obtain the
   appropriate contact URI when querying the LoST service [RFC5222].
   This is accomplished by appending a Service Coverage Scope at the
   end of the Service URN.

   The presence of a Service Coverage Scope in a Service URN indicates
   that the requester wants the service provider that provides the
   given service over the given coverage area for the given location.
   For example "urn:service:sos.police.country" specifies the
   national/federal police, "urn:service:sos.police.A1" the
   state/provincial/region/prefecture police,
   "urn:service:sos.police.A1" the county/parish/gun/district
   sheriff/police and "urn:service:sos.police.A3" the city/township/shi
   police.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

3. Service Coverage Scope

   A Service Coverage Scope SHALL be one of the following:


   +------------------------+----------------------+
   | Service Coverage Scope | Coverage Area        |
   +------------------------+----------------------+
   | country                | Entire country       |
   |                        |                      |
   | A1                     | national             |
   |                        | subdivision (state,  |
   |                        | region, province,    |
   |                        | prefecture)          |
   |                        |                      |
   | A2                     | county, parish, gun  |
   |                        | (JP), district (IN)  |
   |                        |                      |
   | A3                     | city, township, shi  |
   |                        | (JP)                 |
   |                        |                      |
   | A4                     | city division,       |
   |                        | borough, city        |
   |                        | district, ward, chou |
   |                        | (JP)                 |
   |                        |                      |
   | A5                     | neighborhood, block  |
   +------------------------+----------------------+

   The astute reader will immediately notice that the Service Coverage
   Scope names are identical to elements found in the civic location
   format [RFC4119].  This is to avoid utilizing political division
   nomenclature that is not universally applicable. For example
   "urn:service:sos.police.A1" specifies provincial police in Canada,
   prefecture police in Japan and state police in the United States of
   America.

   A Service Coverage Scope MAY be used with any valid Service URN when
   a coverage area needs to be specified.

   A Service Coverage Scope SHALL be the last element of a Service URN.

Internet-Draft   Jurisdictional Scope for Service URN        March 2013


   There SHALL NOT be more than one Service Coverage Scope specified in
   a Service URN.

   When a Service Coverage Scope is specified, the service requested
   SHALL be provided over the entire coverage area.  For example, the
   fictitious Whoville Fire Department cannot be contacted using
   "urn:service:sos.fire.A2" as it does not provide fire prevention
   services over the entire county/parish/gun/district the city of
   Whoville belongs to.

   Nothing in this document prevents a service provider from offering
   their service over multiple coverage areas.  For example, three
   neighbouring counties may decide to utilize the same sheriff
   department for all three counties.  The Service URN
   "urn:service:sos.police.A2" can be used in all three counties to
   reach the sheriff department.  The sheriff department cannot be
   reached using "urn:service:sos.police.A1" since it does not cover
   the entire state/province/region/prefecture.

   The use of a Service Coverage Scope SHALL NOT change the intent of
   the Service URN it is appended to.  For example, if a police
   department exists at the country level but it does not accept
   emergency calls, "urn:service:sos.police.country" cannot not be used
   to reach it as "urn:service:sos" and its subservices are intended to
   be used only when requesting immediate assistance [RFC5031].



4. Impact of Service Coverage Scopes on LoST Service Implementations

   An implementation of a LoST service does not need to be modified in
   order to utilize Service Coverage Scopes.  Service URNs containing a
   Service Coverage Scope are provisioned exactly the same way as any
   other Service URNs.  Care must be given to ensure that service
   providers provisioned using a Service URN that includes a Service
   Coverage Scope do indeed provide the service over the entire
   designated coverage area.

   This document introduces a new element that is appended to a Service
   URN.  In the future, other subservices will be introduced that will
   also be added to Service URNs.  It can be likely that a LoST Service
   is queried with a Service URN that is not provisioned, especially if
   the requester is a device which originates from a location where
   such a service exists.  It may be desirable that the LoST Service
   returns a "next best thing" answer instead of serviceNotImplemented
   error.  As specified in RFC-5222 section 5.4 [RFC5222], a LoST
   Service implementation can substitute another service in the case

Internet-Draft   Jurisdictional Scope for Service URN        March 2013


   the given service is not defined.  A method to accomplish this is to
   unroll the given Service URN.  When a request to the LoST Service
   evaluates to what would be a serviceNotImplemented error, the LoST
   Service SHOULD remove the last element of the provided Service URN
   and re-evaluate the request.  If the re-evaluation still results in
   what would be serviceNotImplemented, it SHOULD repeat the process
   again until all elements of the Service URN have been removed, in
   which case the LoST Service SHALL return a serviceNotImplemented
   error back to the requester.



5. Security Considerations

   <Blatantly copied from RFC-5031> As an identifier, the Service URN
   does not appear to raise any particular security issues.  The
   services described by the URN are meant to be well-known, even if
   the particular service instance is access-controlled, so privacy
   considerations do not apply to the URN.

   There are likely no specific privacy issues when including a Service
   URN on a web page, for example.  On the other hand, ferrying the URN
   in a signaling protocol can give attackers information on the kind
   of service desired by the caller.  For example, this makes it easier
   for the attacker to automatically find all calls for emergency
   services or directory assistance.  Appropriate, protocol-specific
   security mechanisms need to be implemented for protocols carrying
   Service URNs.  The mapping protocol needs to address a number of
   threats, as detailed in [RFC5069].  That document also discusses the
   security considerations related to the use of the Service URN for
   emergency services.
