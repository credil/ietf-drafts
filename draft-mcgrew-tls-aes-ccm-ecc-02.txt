                   AES-CCM ECC Cipher Suites for TLS
                    draft-mcgrew-tls-aes-ccm-ecc-02

Abstract

   This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
   in the Counter and CBC-MAC Mode (CCM) of operation within Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) to provide confidentiality and data origin
   authentication.  The AES-CCM algorithm is amenable to compact
   implementations, making it suitable for constrained environments.
   The ciphersuites defined in this document use Elliptic Curve
   Cryptography (ECC), and are intended for use in networks with limited
   bandwidth.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
   [AES] in Counter with CBC-MAC Mode (CCM) [CCM] in several TLS
   ciphersuites.  AES-CCM provides both authentication and
   confidentiality and uses as its only primitive the AES encrypt
   operation (the AES decrypt operation is not needed).  This makes it
   amenable to compact implementations, which is advantageous in
   constrained environments.  The use of AES-CCM has been specified for
   IPsec ESP [RFC4309] and 802.15.4 wireless networks [IEEE802154].

   Authenticated encryption, in addition to providing confidentiality
   for the plaintext that is encrypted, provides a way to check its
   integrity and authenticity.  Authenticated Encryption with Associated
   Data, or AEAD [RFC5116], adds the ability to check the integrity and
   authenticity of some associated data that is not encrypted.  This
   note utilizes the AEAD facility within TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] and the AES-
   CCM-based AEAD algorithms defined in [RFC5116].  Additional AEAD
   algorithms are defined in this note; these use AES-CCM but have
   shorter authentication tags, and therefore are more suitable for use
   across networks in which bandwidth is constrained and message sizes
   may be small.

   The ciphersuites defined in this document use Ephemeral Elliptic
   Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) as their key establishment mechanism;
   these ciphersuites can be used with DTLS [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4347-bis].

1.1.  Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]


2.  ECC based AES-CCM Cipher Suites

   The ciphersuites defined in this document are based on the AES-CCM
   authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) algorithms
   AEAD_AES_128_CCM and AEAD_AES_256_CCM described in [RFC5116].  The
   following ciphersuites are defined:

      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM = {TBD1,TBD1}
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CCM = {TBD2,TBD2}
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 = {TBD3,TBD3}
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CCM_8 = {TBD4,TBD4}

   These ciphersuites make use of the AEAD capability in TLS 1.2
   [RFC5246].  Note that each of these AEAD algorithms uses AES-CCM.

Internet-Draft               AES-CCM ECC TLS                October 2011


   Ciphersuites ending with "8" use eight-octet authentication tags; the
   other ciphersuites have 16 octet authentication tags.

   The HMAC truncation option described in Section 3.5 of [RFC4366]
   (which negotiates the "truncated_hmac" TLS extension) does not have
   an effect on the cipher suites defined in this note, because they do
   not use HMAC to protect TLS records.

   The "nonce" input to the AEAD algorithm is as in [RFC5288]; for the
   convenience of the reader, we summarize the details in this note.
   The "nonce" SHALL be 12 bytes long and constructed as follows:

            struct {
               case client:
                  uint32 client_write_IV;  // low order 32-bits
               case server:
                  uint32 server_write_IV;  // low order 32-bits
               uint64 seq_num;
            } CCMNonce.

   In DTLS, the 64-bit seq_num field is the 16-bit DTLS epoch field
   concatenated with the 48-bit sequence_number field.  The epoch and
   sequence_number appear in the DTLS record layer.

   This construction allows the internal counter to be 32-bits long,
   which is a convenient size for use with CCM.

   These ciphersuites make use of the default TLS 1.2 Pseudorandom
   Function (PRF), which uses HMAC with the SHA-256 hash function.

   The ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange is performed as defined in [RFC4492],
   with the following additional stipulations:

   o  The curve secp256r1 MUST be supported, and the curves secp384r1
      and secp521r1 MAY be supported; these curves are equivalent to the
      NIST P-256, P-384, and P-521 curves.  Note that all of these
      curves have cofactor equal to one, which simplifies their use.
   o  The server's certificate MUST contain an ECDSA-capable public key,
      it MUST be signed with ECDSA, and it MUST use SHA-256, SHA-384, or
      SHA-512.  The Signature Algorithms extension (Section 7.4.1.4.1 of
      [RFC5246]) MUST be used to indicate support of those signature and
      hash algorithms.  If a client certificate is used, the same
      conditions apply to it.  The acceptable choices of hashes and
      curves that can be used with each ciphersuite are detailed in
      Section 2.1.
   o  The uncompressed point format MUST be supported.  Other point
      formats MAY be used.

   o  The client SHOULD offer the elliptic_curves extension and the
      server SHOULD expect to receive it.
   o  The client MAY offer the ec_point_formats extension, but the
      server need not expect to receive it.
   o  [RFC6090] MAY be used as an implementation method.

   Implementations of these ciphersuites will interoperate with
   [RFC4492], but can be more compact than a full implementation of that
   RFC.

2.1.  Required Algorithms for each CipherSuite

   The curves and hash algorithms that can be used with each ciphersuite
   are as follows.  The ciphersuites TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM
   and TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 MUST be used with one of the
   following combinations:

   o  secp256r1 and SHA-256, or
   o  secp384r1 and SHA-384, or
   o  secp521r1 and SHA-512.

   The ciphersuites TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CCM and
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CCM_8 MUST be used with one of the
   following combinations:

   o  secp384r1 and SHA-384, or
   o  secp521r1 and SHA-512.


3.  TLS Versions

   These ciphersuites make use of the authenticated encryption with
   additional data defined in TLS 1.2 [RFC5288].  They MUST NOT be
   negotiated in older versions of TLS.  Clients MUST NOT offer these
   cipher suites if they do not offer TLS 1.2 or later.  Servers which
   select an earlier version of TLS MUST NOT select one of these cipher
   suites.  Because TLS has no way for the client to indicate that it
   supports TLS 1.2 but not earlier, a non-compliant server might
   potentially negotiate TLS 1.1 or earlier and select one of the cipher
   suites in this document.  Clients MUST check the TLS version and
   generate a fatal "illegal_parameter" alert if they detect an
   incorrect version.


4.  New AEAD algorithms

   The following AEAD algorithms are defined:

Internet-Draft               AES-CCM ECC TLS                October 2011


      AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8 = TBD9
      AEAD_AES_256_CCM_8 = TBD10

4.1.  AES-128-CCM with an 8-octet ICV

   The AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8 authenticated encryption algorithm is
   identical to the AEAD_AES_128_CCM algorithm (see Section 5.3 of
   [RFC5116]), except that it uses eight octets for authentication,
   instead of the full sixteen octets used by AEAD_AES_128_CCM.  The
   AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8 ciphertext consists of the ciphertext output of
   the CCM encryption operation concatenated with the 8-octet
   authentication tag output of the CCM encryption operation.  Test
   cases are provided in [CCM].  The input and output lengths are as for
   AEAD_AES_128_CCM.  An AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8 ciphertext is exactly 8
   octets longer than its corresponding plaintext.

4.2.  AES-256-CCM with an 8-octet ICV

   The AEAD_AES_256_CCM_8 authenticated encryption algorithm is
   identical to the AEAD_AES_256_CCM algorithm (see Section 5.4 of
   [RFC5116]), except that it uses eight octets for authentication,
   instead of the full sixteen octets used by AEAD_AES_256_CCM.  The
   AEAD_AES_256_CCM_8 ciphertext consists of the ciphertext output of
   the CCM encryption operation concatenated with the 8-octet
   authentication tag output of the CCM encryption operation.  Test
   cases are provided in [CCM].  The input and output lengths are as for
   AEAD_AES_128_CCM.  An AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8 ciphertext is exactly 8
   octets longer than its corresponding plaintext.


5.  History

   The 02 version removed the AEAD_AES_128_CCM_12 and
   AEAD_AES_256_CCM_12 AEAD algorithms, because they were not needed in
   any ciphersuites.  The AES-256 ciphersuites were retained, however,
   to provide a secure cipher for use with the higher security curves
   secp384r1 and secp521r1.

   This section is to be removed by the RFC editor upon publication.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned values for the Ciphersuites defined in Section 2
   and the AEAD algorithms defined in Section 4 of this note.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Perfect Forward Secrecy

   The perfect forward secrecy properties of ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
   ciphersuites are discussed in the security analysis of [RFC4346].
   This analysis applies to the ECDHE ciphersuites.

7.2.  Counter Reuse

   AES-CCM security requires that the counter is never reused.  The IV
   construction in Section 2 is designed to prevent counter reuse.
