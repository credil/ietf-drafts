INTERNET DRAFT          Functional architecture         October 20, 2011


1  Introduction

   This memo presents a functional architecture able to provide cross
   stratum optimization services with seamless control of both IT
   resources and network connectivity among them.

2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Additionally, the following terms are defined:

      - IT resources: in the context of this document, the Information
      Technology (IT) resources refer to computing and storage resources
      (disk capacity, CPU, etc) typically residing on Data Centers (DC)
      spread along the network.


3  Architecture overview

   Figure 1 shows the proposed architecture for implementing a global
   cross-stratum optimization. This architecture is composed of three
   distinct controllers, namely Service, IT Resources and Enhanced
   Network controllers. Each of these controllers could be implemented
   as monolithic central nodes or either as a distributed set of
   elements forming a control plane. Furthermore, these controllers
   could be implemented as separated entities or be part of a common
   one, for any combination of them. In the latter case, the logical
   interfaces defined among them could be supported by the same physical
   interface.

   The Service Controller receives service demands from one application
   or application controller demanding IT resources and/or network
   capacity for connecting them. After processing such demands, it will
   manage the service composition interacting with the specific modules
   defined for IT and Network control.

   The IT Resources and the Enhanced Network controllers cooperate then
   to configure the infrastructure in both the IT and the network side,
   in order to provide the global service.

   The IT and Network resources to be controlled could be either
   physical or virtualized resources. In the latter case, an additional
   virtualization component would be needed to interact with both IT
   Resources and Enhanced Network controllers for providing the virtual
   abstraction from the physical resources.

   The main components of this architecture are deeply discussed in the
   following chapters.


4  Components description


4.1  Service Controller

   The Service Controller provides an interface to application providers
   helping to hide the complexity of network and IT provisioning to
   them. It is in charge of the end-to-end service management.

INTERNET DRAFT          Functional architecture         October 20, 2011


   This controller is in charge of translating incoming infrastructure
   service requests (triggered by an application or application
   controller) into one or more IT and Network resources requests to
   compose and orchestrate the desired service.

   The specification of the resources for that service could include
   both the description of the IT capabilities involved in the service
   and the characterization of the network connectivity required to
   support the traffic among the IT end?points.


4.2  IT Resources Controller

   The IT Resources controller is in charge of the IT resources
   configuration and management as part of the requested service.


4.3  Enhanced Network Controller

   The Enhanced Network controller component implements a network
   control plane (e.g., GMPLS/PCE based for the optical case) capable of
   provisioning network services connecting the IT resources (at the
   endpoints)in an on demand basis, dynamically scaling infrastructure
   resources based on the needs arriving through the Service controller

   In the most advanced scenarios, this controller could be even
   responsible of selecting the related IT resources attached at the
   network edges, according to the specifications that the Service
   controller has retrieved from the application requirements. Thus, the
   Enhanced Network controller not only provides network connections
   towards a set of pre?defined destinations during the setup of an IT
   service, but can also assist the Service controller in the selection
   of the most efficient set of IT endpoints (in case of not being
   tightly specified) and in the service recovery. That is, the
   configuration of IT resources (triggered by the IT Resources
   controller) and network resources (triggered by the Enhanced Network
   controller) is coordinated globally by the Service Controller, with
   the active help of the Enhanced Network Controller, that acts as the
   actual decision point.  

   In order to support this functionality, the Enhanced Network
   Controller must be aware of the capabilities and availabilities of
   the IT resources at the end-points, so that this information can be
   used in the end-to-end path computation. It should be noted that,
   despite this, the Enhanced Network controller is not allowed to
   directly control the IT resources. On the other hand, the IT
   Resources controller must be able to inform the Enhanced Network
   controller about the availability/capability of the IT resources at

   the controlled IT sites.


5  Interfaces for cross-stratum optimization in end-to-end service
   provisioning

   The proposed architecture includes the following inter-layer
   interfaces:

      - Application Controller <-> Service Controller interface: used by
      the Application Controller to request the dynamic provisioning of
      end-to-end services involving interconnected IT resources. 

      - Service Controller <-> IT Resource Controller interface: used by
      the Service Controller to request the configuration of the IT
      resources, selected according to the service description provided
      in the application request. This selection COULD be performed
      based on network quotations or suggestions about the IT end-points
      received from the Enhanced Network Controller. 

      - Service Controller <-> Enhanced Network Controller interface:
      used by the Service Controller to request network connectivity
      services among the IT end-points. Further enhanced services COULD
      be supported, including requests for network quotations between
      two specific end-points or services , where the Enhanced Network
      Controller is also responsible for the selection of the IT end-
      points. This interface COULD also be used for recovery
      functionalities, where the Enhanced Network Controller is able to
      inform the Service Controller about network service failures. 

      - IT Resource Controller <-> Enhanced Network Controller
      interface: used by the IT Resource Controller to inform the
      Enhanced Network Controller about IT resource capabilities and
      availabilities. This type of information is typically used at the
      Enhanced Network Controller, when it acts as decision point for
      the selection of the IT resources to be allocated for the end-to-
      end service.
