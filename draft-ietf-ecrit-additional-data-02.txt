              Additional Data related to an Emergency Call
                draft-ietf-ecrit-additional-data-02.txt

Abstract

   When an emergency call is sent to a Public Safety Answering Point
   (PSAP), the device that sends it, as well as any service provider in
   the path of the call, or access network may have information about
   the call which the PSAP may be able to use.  This document describes
   an XML data structure that contains this kind of information in a
   standardized form.  A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that points
   to the structure can be included in the SIP signaling with the call,
   or the data may be included in the body of a SIP message.

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2011


1.  Introduction

   As communications devices increasingly utilize the Internet to
   interconnect and communicate, users will expect to use such devices
   to request help.  The Internet Protocol suite provides many
   advantages but also requires re-thinking of the traditional emergency
   calling architecture.  The IETF emergency services architecture, as
   described in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework] and
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp], offers a much richer communication
   exchange and thereby better situational awareness for call takers.
   The richness comes in various forms, including the multi-media
   communication capabilities (via voice, video, instant messaging, and
   real-time text), but also via more extensive flow of information.
   Sharing information between various actors will enable more
   intelligent decision making and therefore better response in case of
   an emergency.  A pre-requisite is to offer the technical capabilities
   to let call takers to gain access to this information stored
   elsewhere (granted that they are authorized to access it).

   In general, there are four types of data exchanged:

   Data Associated with a Call:  A lot of information is carried in the
      call setup procedure itself (as part of the SIP headers as well as
      in the body of the SIP message, e.g., for example supported
      capabilities of the device).  This also includes information about
      the emergency caller's identity.

   Data Associated with a Location:  Location information is available
      via the PIDF-LO element, which includes civic and geospatial
      location, information about the entity that provided the data,
      information about how the location was obtained (as expressed by
      the <method> element, see Section 2.2.3 of [RFC4119], and the
      values registered in
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/method-tokens/method-tokens.xml),
      and which entity or organization supplied location information
      (beyond the domain information that can be inferred from a signing
      certificate) available via the <provided-by> element.

   Data Associated with a Caller:  This is personal data about a caller,
      including medical information.

   Data associated with a PSAP:  When a PSAP handles a call it develops
      information about the call, which must be passed to subsequent
      PSAPs, dispatchers and/or responders.

   When an emergency call is sent to a PSAP, there is a rich set of data
   in the SIP message used for the call setup, but the device, as well
   as any other service provider in the path may have even more

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2011


   information useful for a PSAP.  This information may include the
   identity and contact information of the service provider, subscriber
   identity and contact information, the type of service the provider
   offers, what kind of device the user has, etc.  Some data is device
   or service dependent data.  For example, a car telematics system or
   service may have crash information.  A medical monitoring device may
   have sensor data.  While the details of the information may vary by
   device or service, there needs to be a common way to send such data
   to a PSAP.

   This document focuses on the data that can be obtained about a call
   and a mechanism for transporting it in an existing SIP header field,
   the Call-Info header, which is specified in Section 20.9 of
   [RFC3261].  For this purpose a new token, namely 'emergencyCallData'
   is defined to be carried in the "purpose" parameter.  If the
   "purpose" parameter is set to 'emergencyCallData' then the Call-Info
   header contains a HTTPS URL that points to a data structure with
   information about the call or a CID that allows the data structure to
   be placed in the body of the message.  Section 8 shows a SIP INVITE
   example containing such a Call-Info header.

   Besides a service provider in the path of a call, the access network
   (which in the IETF emergency call architecture provides location in
   the form of a PIDF-LO [RFC4119]) also has similar information that
   would be valuable to the PSAP.  This information is not specific to
   the location itsef, but rather to the immmediate circumstances about
   the provision of the location (who the access network is, how to
   contact that entity, what kind of service the access network
   provides, possibly subscriber data, etc.).  This data is in nearly
   every respect similar to the data known by services providers in the
   path of the call.  For this reason, this document describes a
   "provided-by" namespace per [RFC4119] for passing information known
   to the access network.

   The data is defined as a series of "blocks" that represent a class of
   information.  Each of the blocks is a MIME type, and an extensible
   set of these types constitute the data structure.  A registry is
   defined to list the block types that may be included.

   The data structure contains an element which itself is a URI that has
   device or service dependent data.  Thus the common Additional Data
   about a Call defined by this document contains a 'hook', in the form
   of a URI, for a device or service dependent data structure.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Call-Info Specification

   The Additional Data about a Call is information specific to a call
   known by the device that sends it or a service provider in the path
   of a call or in the access network the call originates in.  The
   Additional Data about a Call is a set of information blocks.  Each
   block is a MIME type, and any set of blocks may be included in the
   set.

   Two mechanisms are provided to transport the data set, namely

   1.  A URI to the data set MAY be inserted in a SIP INVITE or MESSAGE
       transaction with a Call-Info header containing a purpose of
       "emergenyCallData".  If the data is provided by reference, it may
       be retrieved with an HTTPS Get from the URI.  The URI MUST
       specify an HTTPS scheme, and TLS protection for the data MUST be
       negotiated.

   2.  The data may be supplied by value in a SIP INVITE or MESSAGE
       message.  In this case, Content Indirection (CID) [RFC2392] is
       used, with the CID URL pointing to the body of the message.

   More than one Call-Info header with an emergencyCallData purpose can
   be expected.  The device MAY insert one, and any intermediary service
   provider MAY insert its own.  When there are multiple intermediaries,
   each intermediary MAY each insert one.  For example, a device may
   provide one, a telematics service provider may provide one and the
   mobile carrier handling the call may provide one.

   Note: The access network MAY supply additional data as well.  For
   this purpose, this document defines a namespace and adds the
   namespace to the "provided-by" registry defined by PIDF-LO [RFC4119].

   Additional data about a call is defined as a series of MIME objects,
   each with an XML data structure contained inside.  MIME-multipart is
   used to enclose the XML documents and the sections below define them.

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2011


4.  Data Provider Information

   This block is intended to be provided by any service provider in the
   path of the call or the access network provider.  It includes
   identification and contact information.  This block SHOULD be
   provided for every service provider in the path of the call, and the
   access network provider.  Devices also use this block to provide
   identifying information.  The MIME type is "addDataProviderInfo+xml".

4.1.  Data Provider String

   Data Element:  Data Provider String


   Use:  Required


   XML Element:  <DataProviderString>


   Description:  This is a plain language string suitable for displaying
      the name of the service provider that created the additional data
      structure.  If the device created the structure the value is
      identical to the contact header in the SIP INVITE.


   Reason for Need:  Inform the call taker about the identity of the
      entity providing the additional call data structure.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Allows the call taker to interpret the data
      in this structure.  The source of the information often influences
      how the information is used, believed or verified.

4.2.  Data Provider ID

   Data Element:  Data Provider ID


   Use:  Conditional


   XML Element:  <ProviderID>


   Description:  A jurisdiction specific code for the provider shown in
      the <DataProvidedBy> element that created the structure of the
      call.  This data SHOULD be provided if the local jurisdiction
      maintains such an ID list.  For example, in North America, this

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2011


      would be a "NENA Company ID".  Devices would not typically use
      this element.


   Reason for Need:  Inform the call taker about the identity of the
      entity providing the additional call data structure.


   How Used by Call Taker:  Where jurisdictions have lists of providers
      the Data Provider ID can lead to a wealth of information.

4.3.  Data Provider Contact URI

   Data Element:  Data Provider Contact URI


   Use:  Required


   XML Element:  <ContractURI>


   Description:  For a service provider the contact SHOULD be a contact
      URI.  This must be a SIP URI.  If a telephone number is the
      contact address it should be provided in the form of
      sip:telephonenumber@serviceprovider:user=phone.  If the call is
      from a device, this data is required and should reflect the
      contact information of the owner of the device.  This should be a
      URI to a 24/7 support organization tasked to provide PSAP support
      for this emergency call.


   Reason for Need:  Additional data providers may need to be contacted
      for error or other unusual circumstances.


   How Used by Call Taker:  To contact the supplier of the additional
      data provider structure.

4.4.  Data Provider Languages(s) Supported

   Data Element:  Data Provider Language(s) supported


   Use:  Conditional

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2011


   XML Element:  <Language>


   Description:  Provided by's alpha 2-character code as defined in ISO
      639-1:2002
      (http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=22109) Codes for
      the representation of names of languages -- Part 1: Alpha-2 code
      Multiple instances of this element may occur.  Order is
      significant; preferred language should appear first.  This data is
      required if a Data Provider Contact URI is provided.  The content
      must reflect the languages supported at the contact URI.


   Reason for Need:  Information needed to determine if emergency
      service authority can communicate with the service provider or if
      language line will be needed.


   How Used by Call Taker:  If call taker cannot speak language(s)
      supported by the service provider, at translation service will
      need to be added in to the conversation.

4.5.  vCARD of Data Provider

   Data Element:  vCARD of Data Provider


   Use:  Optional


   XML Element:  <DataProviderContact>


   Description:  There are many fields in the vCARD and the creator of
      the data structure is encouraged to provide as much information as
      they have available.  For encoding of the vCard this specification
      uses the XML-based encoding specified in [RFC6351].


   Reason for Need:  Information needed to determine additional contact
      information.


   How Used by Call Taker:  Assists call taker by providing additional
      contact information that may not be included in the SIP invite or
      the PIDF-LO.

5.  Service Information

   This block describes the service that the service provider provides
   to the caller.  It SHOULD be included by all SPs in the path of the
   call.  The mime type is "addCallSvcInfo+xml".

5.1.  Service Environment

   Data Element:  Service Environment


   Use:  Required


   XML Element:  <SvcEnvironment>


   Description:  This element defines whether a call is from a business
      or residence caller.  Currently, the only valid entries are
      'Business' or 'Residence'.


   Reason for Need:  To assist in determining equipment and manpower
      requirements.


   How Used by Call Taker:  Information may be used to determine
      equipment and manpower requirements for emergency responders.

5.2.  Service Delivered by Provider to End User

   Data Element:  Service Delivered by Provider to End User


   Use:  Required


   XML Element:  <SvcDelByProvider>


   Description:  This defines the type of service the end user has
      subscribed to.  The implied mobility of this service can not be
      relied upon.  A registry will reflect the following initial valid
      entries:

      *  Mobile Telephone Service: Includes Satellite, CDMA, GSM, Wi-Fi,
         WiMAX, LTE (Long Term Evolution)




Rosen, et al.              Expires May 3, 2012                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2011


      *  Fixed Public Pay/Coin telephones: Any coin or credit card
         operated device.

      *  One way outbound service

      *  Inmate call/service

      *  Soft dialtone/quick service/warm disconnect/suspended

      *  Multi-line telephone system (MLTS): Includes all PBX, Centrex,
         key systems, Shared Tenant Service.

      *  Sensor, unattended: Includes devices that generate DATA ONLY.
         This is one-way information exchange and there will be no other
         form of communication.

      *  Sensor, attended: Includes devices that are supported by a
         monitoring service provider or automatically open a two-way
         communication path.

      *  Wireline: Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS).

      *  VoIP Telephone Service: A type of service that offers
         communication over internet protocol, such as Fixed, Nomadic,
         Mobile, Unknown

      There can be more than one value returned.  For example, a VoIP
      prison telephone service is a reasonable conbination.


   Reason for Need:  Knowing the type of service may assist the PSAP
      with the handling of the call.


   How Used by Call Taker:  Calltakers often use this information to
      determine what kinds of questions to ask callers, and how much to
      rely on supportive information.  An emergency call from a prison
      is treated differently that a call from a sensor device.

6.  Device Information

   This block provides information about the device used to place the
   call.  It should be provided by any service provider that knows what
   device is being used, and by the device itself.  The mime type is
   "addDataDevInfo+xml".

6.1.  Device Classification

   Data Element:  Device Classification


   Use:  Optional


   XML Element:  <DeviceClassification>


   Description:  If the device provides the data structure, the device
      information should be provided.  If the service provider provides
      the structure and it knows what the device is, the service
      provider should provide the device information.  Often the carrier
      does not know what the device is.  It is possible to receive 2
      data structures, one created by the device and one created by the
      service provider.  Information about the device, not how it is
      being used.  This data element defines the kind of device making
      the emergency call.  A registry will reflect the following valid
      entries:

      *  Cordless handset

      *  Fixed phone

      *  Mobile handset

      *  ATA - analog terminal adapter

      *  Satellite phone

      *  Stationary computing device (alarm system, data sensor)

      *  Guardian devices

      *  Desktop PC

      *  Laptop computing device

      *  Not Available


   Reason for Need:  The device classification describes the capability
      of the calling device.  For example, does the device require human
      intervention to initiate a call or is this call the result of
      programmed instructions.  Does the calling device have the ability
      to rebid for location or condition changes?  Is this device
      interactive or a one-way reporting device?


   How Used by Call Taker:  May assist with location of caller.  For
      example, a cordless handset may be outside or next door.  May
      provide calltaker some context about the caller.

9.  Security Considerations

   The information in this data structure will usually be considered
   private.  HTTPS is specified to require the provider of the
   information to validate the credentials of the requester.  While the
   creation of a PKI that has global scope may be difficult, the
   alternatives to creating devices and services that can provide
   critical information securely are more daunting.

   The Call-info header with purpose='emergencyCallData' MUST only be
   sent on an emergency call, which can be ascertained by the presence
   of an emergency service urn in a Route header of a SIP message.

10.  Privacy Considerations

   [Editor's Note: The privacy considerations outlined in
   [I-D.iab-privacy-considerations] need to be addressed here in a
   future version of this document.

   There is much private data in this information.  Local regulations
   may govern what data must be provided in emergency calls, but in
   general, the emergency call system is often aided by the kinds of
   information described in this document.  There is a tradeoff between
   the privacy considerations and the utility of the data.  Certainly,
   if the data cannot be protected, due to failure of the TLS mechanisms
   described here, data not required by regulation SHOULD not be sent.

11.  IANA Considerations

   [Editor's Note: The IANA section is missing the description of new
   registries.  A future version of this draft will contain the
   necessary information.]

11.1.  'emergencyCallData' Purpose Parameter Value

   This document defines the 'emergencyCallData' value for the "purpose"
   parameter of the Call-Info header field.  The Call-Info header and
   the corresponding registry for the 'purpose' parameter was
   established with RFC 3261 [RFC3261].


      Header       Parameter   New
      Field        Name        Value               Reference
      ----------   ---------   -----------------   ---------
      Call-Info    purpose     emergencyCallData   [This RFC]

11.2.  URN Sub-Namespace Registration for provided-by Registry Entry

   This section registers the namespace specified in ??? in the
   provided-by registry established by RFC 4119.

11.3.  MIME Registrations

11.3.1.  MIME Content-type Registration for 'application/
         addDataProviderInfo+xml'

   This specification requests the registration of a new MIME type
   according to the procedures of RFC 4288 [RFC4288] and guidelines in
   RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: addDataProviderInfo+xml

      Mandatory parameters: none

      Optional parameters: charset

      Indicates the character encoding of enclosed XML.

      Encoding considerations:

      Uses XML, which can employ 8-bit characters, depending on the
      character encoding used.  See Section 3.2 of RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

      Security considerations:

      This content type is designed to carry the data provider
      information, which is a sub-category of additional data about an
      emergency call.

      Since this data contains personal information appropriate
      precautions have to be taken to limit unauthorized access,
