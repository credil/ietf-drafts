Internet-Draft       G-ACh type for G.8113.1 OAM             April 2012




Abstract

   This document assigns a Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) Type for
   carrying ITU-T MPLS Transport Profile Operations, Administration, and
   Management (MPLS-TP OAM) messages in the MPLS Generic Associated
   Channel.

1. Introduction

   The Transport Profile of MPLS (MPLS-TP) defined in [RFC5654] is a
   profile of MPLS technology for use in packet transport networks. The
   MPLS-TP profile includes a set of Operations, Administration, and
   Management (OAM) tools defined by the IETF
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-analysis], that are used to meet the OAM
   functional requirements defined in [RFC5860].

   ITU-T Recommendation [G.8113.1] documents MPLS-TP OAM. This
   Recommendation builds upon Ethernet OAM as documented in [Y.1731].
   The messages in [G.8113.1] are defined to be carried in a new
   Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) Type in the MPLS Generic
   Associated Channel.  In order to carry these messages in an
   interoperable fashion, a Generic Associated Channel Type from the
   IANA maintained registry "Pseudowire Associated Channel Types'' is to
   be used.

   To fulfill the request from ITU-T SG15 in [LS370] and to allow
   deployment of the [G.8113.1] OAM solution without using an
   experimental G-ACh Type, this document requests IANA to assign a G-
   ACh Type for use by the ITU-T for [G.8113.1]. This G-ACh type shall
   be known as the G.8113.1 OAM G-ACh Type.

   A number of experts in the IETF do not consider that the development
   or deployment of a second protocol solution within the same
   architectural problem space is necessary or advisable
   [I-D.sprecher-mpls-tp-oam-considerations].

2. Conventions used in this document

2.1. Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Scope of the G.8113.1 OAM G-ACh Type

   The G-ACh Type assigned by this document MUST only be used for OAM
   messages, defined in the ITU-T Recommendation [G.8113.1], carried in
   the G-ACh. The OAM messages and procedures carried behind this G-ACh
   type, are restricted to only those that address the OAM functional
   requirements defined in [RFC5860]. Other message types MUST NOT be
   carried behind this G-ACh type.

   All ITU-T Recommendations are subject to updates by errata,
   corrigenda, amendments or complete revisions.  In any update of
   [G.8113.1] the G-ACh Type assigned by this document MUST NOT be used
   for any functions not identified as OAM functional requirements in
   [RFC5860]. An update of [G.8113.1] may use the G-ACh Type assigned
   by this document to support the OAM functions identified in
   [RFC5860]. When an amendment or complete revision of G.8113.1 is
   approved the reference to [G.8113.1], provided in this document,
   should be updated to show the approval date of the new version.

   The G-ACh Type assigned by this document may be used on any
   transport construct that uses the G-ACh, e.g., MPLS-TP Sections,
   MPLS-TP LSPs or PWs as described in [G.8113.1].



4. Security Considerations

   As noted in [RFC5586], when new G-ACh Types are defined, the
   "security considerations MUST be described in the relevant
   associated channel type specification." The IETF takes this
   opportunity to remind the ITU-T of the need to describe security
   considerations in [G.8113.1].

5. IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains a registry of Pseudowire Associated Channel Types as
   a subregistry of the Pseudowire Name Spaces registry.

   IANA is requested to allocate a new G-ACh Type as follows:

      Value        Description              TLV Follows  Reference

      -----------  -----------------------  -----------  ---------

      TBD          G.8113.1 OAM             No           [This.I-D]

   A value of 0x8902 is suggested.
