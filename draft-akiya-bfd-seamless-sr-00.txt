1.  Introduction

   One application for Seamless Bidrectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
   [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-base] is to perform full reachability
   validations, partial reachability validations and adjacency segment
   ID verifications on a Segment Routing (SR) based environment.

   This specification defines procedures to use Seamless BFD in a SR
   based environment.

2.  BFD Target Identifier Types

   BFD target identifier type of value 2 is used for SR.  Note that BFD
   target identifier type of value 2, which specifies segment routing
   node segment ID, is not tied to a specific routing protocol.  If
   definitions and procedures need routing protocol specifics, then IGP
   specific SR types will be defined.

3.  Reserved BFD Discriminators

Internet-Draft             Seamless BFD for SR                 June 2013


   With SR technology, BFD target identifier type 2 is used.  BFD
   discriminator values corresponding to all or subset of local node
   segment IDs are to be reserved on corresponding network node.  Node
   segment IDs are used as BFD discriminators.  Corresponding BFD
   discriminators MUST be reserved and those BFD discriminators MUST NOT
   be used for other BFD sessions.

   Example:

   o  BFD Target Identifier Type 2: Node segment ID 0x03E9A0FF maps to
      BFD discriminator 0x03E9A0FF.

4.  BFD Target Identifier Table

   With SR BFD target identifier type, only locally reserved BFD
   discriminators and corresponding information are to be in this table.
   No inter-node communications are needed to exchange BFD discriminator
   and BFD target identifier mappings.

5.  Full Reachability Validations

5.1.  Initiator Behavior

   Any SR network node can attempt to perform a full reachability
   validation to any BFD target identifier of type 2 (node segment ID)
   on other network nodes, as long as destination BFD target identifier
   is provisioned to use this mechanism.  Transmitted BFD control packet
   by the initiator is to have "your discriminator" corresponding to
   destination BFD target identifier of type 2.

   Initiator is to use following procedures to construct BFD control
   packets to perform SR full reachability validations:

   o  MUST set "your discriminator" to target node segment ID.
   o  MUST use explicit label switching packet format described in [I-D
      .akiya-bfd-seamless-base].

5.2.  Responder Behavior

   To respond to received BFD control packet which was targeted to local
   BFD target identifier of type 2 (Segment Routing Node Segment ID),
   response BFD control packet is targeted to IP address taken from
   received "source IP address".  Responder MUST validate obtained IP
   address is in valid format (ex: not Martian address).  Responder MUST
   consult local routing table to ensure obtained IP address is
   reachable.  Responder MAY impose node segment ID, corresponding to
   obtained IP address, on the response BFD control packet.

6.  Partial Reachability Validations

   Procedures described in [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-base] applies.

7.  MPLS Label Verifications

   With target identifier type 2, SR based, when a network node wants to
   test an adjacency segment ID, then adjacency segment ID (label value
   + EXP) being tested is encoded as lower 23 bits of localhost IP
   destination address.  When passive BFD session receives a SR BFD
   control packet with lower 23 bits of IP destination address non-zero,
   then response will contain adjacency segment ID (label value + EXP)
   corresponding to incoming interface as lower 23 bits of localhost IP
   destination address.

   Simple ASCII art is provided to illustrate the MPLS label
   verification concept on a SR network.

               md=50/yd=R3/DIP=127...R2R3
   Active  [1] - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - >  Passive
   BFD     < - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [2]   BFD
   Session     md=R3/yd=50/DIP=127...R3R2      Session

                               (adj SID R2R3)->
     R1 ------------------ R2 ------------------ R3
                               <-(adj SID R3R2)


   If a response BFD control packet is received, then initiator can
   conclude that a packet has reached intended node correctly.  With
   information embedded in last 23 bits of response BFD control packet
   from responder, initiator has the ability to perform further
   verifications on how responded node received BFD control packet.

8.  Provisioning Active BFD Sessions for SR Networks

   Many factors will influence how to provision active BFD sessions on
   which network nodes.  This section provides some provisioning
   suggestions of active BFD sessions on SR networks.  However, they are
   only suggestions.  Less provisioning of active BFD sessions may be
   required in some cases, or further active BFD sessions may be
   required in other cases.

   Traffic engineered segment routing

   o  SR TE LSP has path-protection and no local repairs on transit
      nodes: Active BFD sessions should be instantiated on the LSP
      ingress.  Instantiated active BFD sessions should perform full



Akiya, et al.           Expires December 09, 2013               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             Seamless BFD for SR                 June 2013


      reachability validation to all node segment IDs that are immediate
      nexthop of all adjacency segment IDs used in the LSP.  This
      verifies that strict switching based on adjacency segment IDs is
      being switched to correct downstream node segment.  If multiple
      links exist on one or more of adjacency points being validated,
      MPLS label verification technique should also be provisioned to
      ensure correct link is being traversed.  Lastly, full reachability
      validation should be performed from LSP ingress to LSP egress to
      verify end-to-end reachability.  Fate of the LSP is tied to all
      active BFD sessions instantiated on LSP ingress.

   o  SR TE LSP has local repairs on transit nodes: Active BFD sessions
      should be instantiated on each local repair points, using
      combination of full reachability validation technique and MPLS
      label verification technique.  These active sessions are
      programmed to be one of the triggers of local repair procedures.
      Lastly, full reachability validation should be performed from LSP
      ingress to LSP egress to verify end-to-end reachability, but this
      should be provisioned with more relaxed failure detection count
      than other active BFD sessions instantiated on transit repair
      points.  Fate of the LSP is tied only to the active BFD session
      verifying end-to-end reachability on LSP ingress.

   Single node segment ID data forwarding

   o  In order to protect all data passing through local network using
      single node segment ID, active BFD sessions can be instantiated on
      each network edge node to verify full reachability to all other
      network edge nodes.

   o  Additionally, it may be beneficial to provision active BFD
      sessions on other network nodes (non-edge) for local repair
      purposes.  These network nodes can also instantiate active BFD
      sessions to desired identifier (edge or non-edge).

9.  Security Considerations

   Same security considerations as [RFC5880], [RFC5881], [RFC5883],
   [RFC5884], [RFC5885] and [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-base] apply to this
   document.

10.  IANA Considerations

   None
