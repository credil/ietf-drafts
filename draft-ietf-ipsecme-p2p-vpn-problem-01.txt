Abstract

   This document describes the problem of enabling a large number of
   systems to communicate directly using IPsec to protect the traffic
   between them.  Manual configuration of all possible tunnels is too
   cumbersome in many such cases.  In other cases the IP address of end
   points change or the end points may be behind NAT gateways, making
   static configuration impossible.  The Auto Discovery VPN solution is
   chartered to address these requirements.

Internet-Draft    Auto Discovery VPN Problem Statement          May 2012


1.  Introduction

   IPsec [RFC4301] is used in several different cases, including tunnel-
   mode site-to-site VPNs and Remote Access VPNs.  Host to host
   communication employing transport mode also exists, but is far less
   commonly deployed.

   The subject of this document is the problem presented by large scale
   deployments of IPsec.  These may be a large collection of VPN
   gateways connecting various sites, a large number of remote endpoints
   connecting to a number of gateways or to each other, or a mix of the
   two.  The gateways and endpoints may belong to a single
   administrative domain or several domains with a trust relationship.

   Section 4.4 of RFC 4301 describes the major IPsec databases needed
   for IPsec processing.  It requires an extensive configuration for
   each tunnel, so manually configuring a system of many gateways and
   endpoints becomes infeasible and inflexible.

   The difficulty is that all the configuration mentioned in RFC 4301 is
   not superfluous.  IKE implementations need to know the identity and
   credentials of all possible peer systems, as well as the addresses of
   hosts and/or networks behind them.  A simplified mechanism for
   dynamically establishing point-to-point tunnels is needed.  Section 2
   contains several use cases that motivate this effort.

1.1.  Terminology

   Endpoint - A host that implements IPsec for its own traffic but does
   not act as a gateway.

   Gateway - A network device that implements IPsec to protect traffic
   flowing through the device.

   Point-to-Point - Direct communication between two parties without
   active participation (e.g. encryption or decryption) by any other
   parties.

   Hub - The central point in a star topology, generally implemented in
   a gateway

   Spoke - The edge devices in a star topology, implemented in endpoints
   or gateways

   Security Association (SA) - Defined in [RFC4301].

2.  Use Cases

   This section presents the key use cases for large-scale point-to-
   point VPN.

   In all of these use cases, the participants (endpoints and gateways)
   may be from a single organization or from multiple organizations with
   an established trust relationship.  When multiple organizations are
   involved, products from multiple vendors are employed so open
   standards are needed to provide interoperability.  Establishing
   communications between participants with no established trust
   relationship is out of scope for this effort.

2.1.  Endpoint-to-Endpoint P2P VPN Use Case

   Two endpoints wish to communicate securely via a direct, point-to-
   point SA.

   The need for secure endpoint to endpoint communications is often
   driven by a need to employ high-bandwidth, low latency local
   connectivity instead of using slow, expensive links to remote
   gateways.  For example, two users in close proximity may wish to
   place a direct, secure video or voice call without needing to send
   the call through remote gateways, which would add latency to the
   call, consume precious remote bandwidth, and increase overall costs.
   Such a usecase also enables connectivity when both endpoints are
   behind NAT gateways.  Such usecase should allow for seamless
   connectivity even as Endpoints roam, in behing or away from gateways.

   In a hub and spoke topology when two end-points communicate, they
   must use a mechanism for authentication, such that they do not expose
   them to impersonation by the other spoke endpoint.

2.2.  Gateway-to-Gateway AD VPN Use Case

   A typical Enterprise traffic model is Hub and Spoke, with the
   Gateways connecting to each other using IPsec tunnels.

   However for the voice and other rich media traffic that occupies a
   lot of bandwidth and the traffic tromboning to the Hub can create
   traffic bottlenecks on the Hub and can lead to a increase cost.  It
   is for this purpose Spoke-to-Spoke tunnels are dynamically created
   and torn-down.

   The Spoke Gateways can themselves come up and down, getting different
   IP addresses in the process, making th static configuration
   impossible.

   Also for the reasons of cost and manual error reduction, it is
   desired there be minimal or even no configuration on the Hub as a new
   Spoke Router is added or removed.

   In a hub and spoke topology when two spoke gateways communicate, they
   must use a mechanism for authentication, such that they do not expose
   them to impersonation by the other gateways spoke.

2.3.  Endpoint-to-Gateway AD VPN Use Case

   An endpoint should be able to use the most efficient gateway as it
   roams in the internet.

   A mobile user roaming on the Internet may connect to a gateway, which
   because of roaming is no longer the most efficient gateway to use
   (reasons could be cost/ efficiency/ latency or some other factor).
   The mobile user should be able to discover and then connect to the
   current most efficient gateway without having to reinitiate the
   connection.

3.  Inadequacy of Existing Solutions

   Several solutions exist for the problems described above.  However,
   none of these solutions is adequate, as described here.

3.1.  Exhaustive Configuration

   One simple solution is to configure all gateways and endpoints in
   advance with all the information needed to determine which gateway or
   endpoint is optimal and to establish an SA with that gateway or
   endpoint.  However, this solution does not scale in a large network
   with hundreds of thousands of gateways and endpoints, especially when
   multiple organizations are involved and things are rapidly changing
   (e.g. mobile endpoints).  Such a solution is also limited by the
   smallest endpoint/ gateway, as the same exhaustive configuration is
   to be applied on all endpoints/ gateways.  A more dynamic, secure and
   scalable system for establishing SAs between gateways is needed.

3.2.  Star Topology

   The most common way to address this problem today is to use what has
   been termed a "star topology".  In this case one or a few gateways
   are defined as "Hub gateways", while the rest of the systems (whether
   endpoints or gateways) are defined as "spokes".  The spokes never
   connect to other spokes.  They only open tunnels with the core
   gateways.  Also for a large number of gateways in one administrative
   domain, one gateway may be defined as the core, and the rest of the
   gateways and remote access clients connect only to that gateway.

   This solution however does not work when the spokes, get dynamic IP
   address which the "core gateways" cannot be configured with.  It is
   also desired that there is minimal to no configuration on the Hub as
   the number of spokes increases and new spokes are added and deleted
   randomly.

   Another problem with stars and trunks is that it creates a high load
   on the core gateways as well as on the trunk connection.  This load
   is both in processing power and in network bandwidth.  A single
   packet in the trunk scenario can be encrypted and decrypted three
   times.  It would be much preferable if these gateways and clients
   could initiate tunnels between them, bypassing the core gateways.
   Additionally, the path bandwidth to these core gateways may be lower
   than that of the path between the satellites.  For example, two
   remote access users may be in the same building with high-speed wifi
   (for example, at an IETF meeting).  Channeling their conversation
   through the core gateways of their respective employers seems
   extremely wasteful, as well as having lower bandwidth.

   The challenge is to build a large scale, IPsec protected networks
   that can dynamically change with minimum administrative overhead.

3.3.  Proprietary Approaches

   Several vendors offer proprietary solutions to these problems.
   However, these solutions offer no interoperability between equipment
   from one vendor and another.  This means that they are generally
   restricted to use within one organization, and it is harder to move
   off such solutions as the features are not standardized.  Besides
   multiple organizations cannot be expected to all choose the same
   equipment vendor.

5.  Security Considerations

   The solution to the problems presented in this draft may involve
   dynamic updates to databases defined by RFC 4301, such as the
   Security Policy Database (SPD) or the Peer Authorization Database
   (PAD).

   RFC 4301 is silent about the way these databases are populated, and
   it is implied that these databases are static and pre-configured by a
   human.  Allowing dynamic updates to these databases must be thought
   out carefully, because it allows the protocol to alter the security
   policy that the IPsec endpoints implement.

   One obvious attack to watch out for is stealing traffic to a
   particular site.  The IP address for www.example.com is 192.0.2.10.
   If we add an entry to an IPsec endpoint's SPD that says that traffic
   to 192.0.2.10 is protected through peer Gw-Mallory, then this allows
   Gw-Mallory to either pretend to be www.example.com or to proxy and
   read all traffic to that site.  Updates to this database requires a
   clear trust model.

   More to be added.
