1. Introduction

   This draft describes how data center network can benefit from
   non-RBridge nodes performing TRILL encapsulation with
   assistance from directory service.

   [RBridge-directory] describes the framework for RBridge edge to
   get MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping from a directory service in
   data center environment instead of flooding unknown DAs across
   TRILL domain. When directory is used, any node, even non-
   RBridge node, can perform the TRILL encapsulation. This draft
   is to demonstrate the benefits of non-RBridge nodes performing
   TRILL encapsulation.

3. Directory Assistance to Non-RBridge

   network switches (i.e. not virtual switches embedded on
   servers), a directory can assist Virtual Switches embedded on
   servers to encapsulate proper TRILL header by providing the
   information of the egress RBridge edge to which the target is
   attached. If a target is not attached to other RBridge edge
   nodes based on the directory [RBridge-Directory], the non-
   RBridge node can forward the data frames natively, i.e. not
   encapsulating any TRILL header.

        Figure 1: TRILL domain in typical Data Center Network


   When a TRILL encapsulated data packet reaches the ingress
   RBridge, the ingress RBridge can simply forward the pre-
   encapsulated packet to the RBridge that is specified in the DA
   field of the TRILL header of the data frame. When the ingress
   RBridge receives a native Ethernet frame, it only forward the
   data frame to the directly attached bridged LAN.

   Under this environment, the ingress RBridge doesn't flood or
   send the received Ethernet data frames to TRILL domain when the
   DA in the Ethernet data frames is unknown or instructed by the
   directory not to be sent across TRILL domain. Under this
   scheme, for an RBridge with multiple ports connected to a
   bridged LAN, data frames received from TRILL domain,
   decapsulated and forwarded to the bridged LAN via one port, and
   flooded back to the RBridge via another port, won't be
   encapsulated again and forwarded back TRILL domain.

   That means there is no need to worry about AF ports and all
   RBridge edge ports connected to one bridged LAN can receive and
   forward pre-encapsulated traffic, which greatly improves the
   overall network utilization.

   Note: [RBridge] Section 4.6.2 Bullet 8 specifies that an
   RBridge port can be configured to accept TRILL encapsulated
   frames from a neighbor that is not an RBridge.

   When data frames do not need to be sent across RBridge domain,
   they are switched by all nodes/ports per IEEE802.1Q and RBridge
   edge will not encapsulate and forward those data frames across
   RBridge domain.

   When a pre-encapsulated TRILL frame arrives at an RBridge whose
   nickname matches with the destination nickname in the TRILL
   header, the processing is exactly same as normal, i.e. it
   decapsulates the received TRILL frame and forwards the
   decapsulated Ethernet frame to the target attached to its edge
   ports. If the DA of the decapsulated Ethernet frame is not in
   the egress RBridge's FDB, the egress RBridge can flood the
   decapsulated Ethernet frame to all hosts attached.

   We call a node that only performs the TRILL encapsulation but
   doesn't participate in RBridge's IS-IS routing a ''TRILL
   Encapsulating node'' or ''Simplified RBridge''. The TRILL
   Encapsulating Node gets the MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping
   table pushed down or pulled from directory servers [RBridge-
   directory]. Upon receiving a native Ethernet frame, the TRILL
   Encapsulating Node checks the MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping
   table, and perform the corresponding TRILL encapsulation if the
   entry is found in the mapping table. If the destination address
   and VLAN of the received Ethernet frame doesn't exist in the
   mapping table and no positive reply from pulling request to a
   directory, the Ethernet frame is forwarded per IEEE802.1Q.

4. Source Nickname in Frames Encapsulated by Non-RBridge Nodes

   The TRILL header includes a Source RBridge's Nickname (ingress)
   and Destination RBridge's Nickname (egress). When a TRILL
   header is added by a non-RBridge node, using the Ingress
   RBridge edge node's nickname in the source address field will
   make the ingress RBridge node receive TRILL frames with its own
   nickname in the frames' source address field, which can be
   confusing.

   To avoid confusion of edge RBridges receiving TRILL
   encapsulated frames with their own nickname in the frames'
   source address field from neighboring non-RBridge nodes, a new
   nickname can be given to an RBridge edge node, e.g. Phantom
   Nickname, to represent all the TRILL Encapsulating Nodes
   attached to the RBridge edge node.

   When the Phantom Nickname is used in the Source Address field
   of a TRILL frame, it is understood that the TRILL encapsulation
   is actually done by a non-RBridge node which is attached to an
   edge port of an RBridge Ingress node.

5. Benefits of Non-RBridge encapsulating TRILL header

5.1. Avoid Nickname Exhaustion Issue

   For a large Data Center with hundreds of thousands of
   virtualized servers, setting TRILL boundary at the servers'
   virtual switches will create a TRILL domain with hundreds of
   thousands of RBridge nodes, which has issues of TRILL Nicknames
   exhaustion and challenges to IS-IS. Setting TRILL boundary at
   aggregation switches that have many virtualized servers
   attached can limit the number of RBridge nodes in a TRILL
   domain, but introduce the issues of very large MAC&VLAN<-
   >RBridgeEdge mapping table to be maintained by RBridge edge
   nodes and the necessity of enforcing AF ports.

   Allowing Non-RBridge nodes to pre-encapsulate data frames with
   TRILL header makes it possible to have a TRILL domain with
   reasonable number of RBridge nodes in a large data center. All
   the TRILL encapsulating nodes attached to one RBridge are
   represented by one TRILL nickname, i.e. Phantom Nickname, which
   avoids the Nickname exhaustion problem.

5.2.  Reduce FDB size for switches on Bridged LANs

   When hosts in a VLAN (or subnet) span across multiple RBridge
   edge nodes and each RBridge edge has multiple VLANs enabled,
   the switches on the bridged LANs attached to the RBridge edge
   are exposed to all MAC addresses among all the VLANs enabled.

   For example, for an Access switch with 40 physical servers
   attached, where each server has 100 VMs, there are 4000 hosts
   under the Access Switch. If indeed hosts/VMs can be moved
   anywhere, the worst case for the Access Switch is when all
   those 4000 VMs belong to different VLANs, i.e. the access
   switch has 4000 VLANs enabled. If each VLAN has 200 hosts, this
   access switch's MAC table potentially has 200*4000 = 800,000
   entries.

   However, if the virtual switches on server pre-encapsulate the
   data frames towards hosts attached to other RBridge Edge nodes
   with TRILL header, the outer MAC DA of those TRILL encapsulated
   data frames will be the MAC address of the local RBridge edge,
   i.e. the ingress RBridge. Therefore, the switches on the local
   bridged LAN don't need to keep the MAC entries for remote hosts
   attached to other RBridge edges.

Internet-Draft Directory Assisted TRILL Encapsulation


   There are multiple ways for local switches to avoid adding
   remote hosts' MAC to their FDB. One simple way is by disabling
   learning on source addresses. The local switches can be pre-
   installed with MAC addresses of local hosts with the assistance
   of directory.



6. Conclusion and Recommendation

    When directory service is available, nodes outside TRILL
    domain become capable of encapsulating TRILL header for data
    frames destined for remote RBridges that is not on the same
    bridged LAN. The non-RBridge encapsulation approach is
    especially useful when there are a large number of servers in
    a data center equipped with hypervisor-based virtual switches.
    It is relatively easy for virtual switches, which are usually
    software based, to get directory assistance and perform
    network address encapsulation.
