Abstract

   Internet Protocol Television(IPTV) is a system facilitating
   transmission of television channels as multicast streams use
   dedicated multicast group addresses in IP networks.Internet Group
   Multicast Protocol(IGMP) is widely used for the communication between
   the hosts and routers to deliver these multicast streams.It is also
   possible for the networks to distinguish these multicast streams not
   only by their destination multicast group but also by the source IP
   address of the streams.In IGMP version-3 implementation,the networks
   can deliver the multicast traffic to the hosts from the specific
   multicast sources requested by the users.This needs a mechanism to
   supply the available multicast source address information to the
   hosts and the hosts also should be strictly implemented with IGMPv3
   client. This document describes a new DHCP option which can addresses
   these issues.In addition to this,the document also describes about
   the advantages in the networks by implementing this option.

1  Introduction

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


1.1  Background

   Many broad band service providers all across the world are delivering
   triple play or multi play solutions.IPTV Solution is widely
   integrated as part of these solutions.In many cases this service is
   run by delivering multicast streams to the IP hosts/Set top boxes
   connected to the home gateways.IGMP protocol is commonly used for
   requesting these multicast streams from the nearest router connected
   via an access network.Below sections will explain the typical
   topology and functionality in most of the traditional access
   networks.

INTERNET DRAFT    DHCP Option for IPTV Source address September 22, 2013


1.1.2  Network behavior

   When any of the hosts starts(eg.power-on)initially, it will do a DHCP
   discover/request to get an IP address to interact with the
   network.DHCP server in the network will assign a unicast IP address
   to the host.The nearest router will be sending IGMP general query
   messages for every query interval time to check if any of the hosts
   are interested in multicast service.If the host is interested in
   receipt of a multicast channel,it will send an IGMP membership report
   message towards the router.The router will forward the multicast
   streams destined to the requested multicast group towards the user
   interface.When the IGMP version-3 is implemented in the network,the
   user will send the IGMP report message to include/exclude particular
   multicast sources from the network.Router will forward the multicast
   streams ONLY from the sources requested by the user.

1.1.3  Limitations

   For the implementation IGMPv3 or for upgrading the networks to
   IGMPv3, the below additional requirements are to be met by the
   network elements:

   1. The network should build a mechanism that supplies the multicast
   source address information to the hosts.

   2. The hosts should be capable of distinguishing the multicast
   streams based on the source IP address from which they are
   originated.

   3. The hosts should strictly follow IGMP version-3 mechanism for
   exchanging IGMP messages with the network elements.

   The new option described in the below sections can effectively
   address these issues.

2. DHCP IPTV Source Address Option

   The "IPTV Source Address" option specifies a list of IPTV source IP
   addresses available or accessible to the client.These source IPs can
   be listed in the order of preference.

   Minimum length of the option is 4 octects and the length must always
   be in multiples of 4.

   Below figure shows the option format :

   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--


3  Server and client behavior

   The defined "IPTV Source Address option" field will be filled by the
   DHCP server while sending the DHCP acknowledgement packet to the
   client.Client can also send a DHCP inform message to the DHCP
   server,requesting this parameter.

   The server will be pre-configured by the multicast source address
   information by the administrator as per the SLA/policy or any such
   criteria specific to the multicast users.

   The clients will use the source addresses obtained from the server
   while interacting with the routers using IGMPv3.

   If the hosts are still using IGMPv2/v1 client or not capable of
   distinguishing the multicast traffic based on the source IP
   address,this is also possible that the intermediate access nodes can
   snoop the DHCP messages.By using this information,the access nodes
   can filter the multicast streams on behalf of the hosts.This snooping
   information can also be used to authenticate the users for accessing
   the multicast service from various multicast sources in the network.

4  Advantages

   By addressing the issues mentioned in the section 1.1.3, the
   implementation of this option in the network provides various
   advantages to the network.

   - It provides an effective method for maintaining and updating the   
     multicast source address information to every multicast host in the
     network as per their individual SLAs.

   - Intermediate access nodes can snoop this option from DHCP          
     acknowledgement to extend the its multicast services like :

     - Forwarding the multicast streams only to the authorized users

     - Acting on behalf of the IGMPv2/v1 hosts and make them integrated 
       with the latest IGMPv3 network. etc.

   - Convergence of IPTV services from different users can be achieved  
     at the user level irrespective of the multicast transmitting       
     technologies used in the network.For example,any service provider  
     who manages the aggregation and access networks can receive the    
     multicast streams from different sources/networks (may not be under
     their own administration) and feed them to their access networks.  
   - The subscribers can easily validate the quality of the service     
     offered by different IPTV sources dynamically and switch to the    
     interested source as per their own set of requirements.

    
3  Security Considerations

   All the security considerations mentioned in rfc2131 (Dynamic Host
   Control Protocol) are applicable for this document.If any malpractice
   or mal function in DHCP may effect further transmission of multicast
   traffic in the network.


4  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the option for multicast source address
   for the registry maintained for DHCP.
