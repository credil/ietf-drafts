          Routing Request Redirection for CDN Interconnection
              draft-he-cdni-routing-request-redirection-02

Abstract

   The Request Routing Interface comprises of (1) the asynchronous
   advertisement of footprint and capabilities by a dCDN that allows a
   uCDN to decide whether to redirect particular user requests to that
   dCDN; and (2) the synchronous operation of an upstream CDN requesting
   whether a downstream CDN is prepared to accept a user request and of
   a downstream CDN responding with how to actually redirect the user
   request.  This document describes an interface for the latter part.

Internet-Draft         Routing Request Redirection             June 2012


1.  Introduction

   A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a system built on an existing IP
   network which is used for large scale content delivery, via
   prefetching or dynamically caching contents on its distributed
   surrogates (caching servers) that are typically deployed close to the
   end users so that a CDN can improve access to the content it caches,
   for example, by reducing access latency and improvingan end user's
   experience.

   In recent years the volume of video and multimedia content delivered
   over the internet is rapidly increasing.  To accommodating this
   increase, existing CDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure
   and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are deploying their own
   CDNs.  Another emerging requirement is CDN Interconnection (CDNI).

   Several real world use cases are described in [I-D.draft-cdni-use-
   cases] which prove the necessity for CDN interconnection.  The most
   frequently mentioned use case is leveraging the collective CDN
   footprint of interconnected standalone CDNs to achieve the goal of
   delivering content to additional distributed end users regardless of
   their location.

   [I-D.draft-cdni-problem- statement] describes the problem area, where
   CDNs are interconnected as described in [I-D.draft-cdni-use-cases]
   based on the requirements described in [I-D.draft-cdni-requirements],
   and using the technology framework described in [I-D.davie-cdni-
   framework].

   The purpose of this document is to define the interface for
   synchronous redirection operation of the request routing interface,
   which is one of the main building blocks of the CDN interconnection
   architecture described in [I-D.draft-cdni- requirements].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   This document reuses the terminology defined in [I-D.draft-cdni-
   problem-statement].  The term "Distinguished CDN Domain" defined in
   [I-D.davie- cdni-framework] is also reused in this document.

   The following additional terms are introduced by this document:

Internet-Draft         Routing Request Redirection             June 2012


   routing process of a CDN.  In DNS Redirection, the DNS resolver of
   the CDN makes the routing decision based on a local policy and
   returns the result as the response of a DNS query request to redirect
   a user agent to a new target.  In CDNI, the result may point to a
   surrogate of the CDN, a request router in a downstream CDN or a
   surrogate in a downstream CDN, etc.

   HTTP Redirection: The act of using an HTTP redirection response to
   redirect a user agent to a new target.  The new target is the result
   of the routing decision of a CDN at the time it receives a content
   request via HTTP.  In CDNI, the result may point to a surrogate of
   the CDN, a request router in a downstream CDN or a surrogate in a
   downstream CDN etc.


3.  Interface function and operation overview

   Editor's note: How an upsteam CDN decides which downstream CDN(s) to
   query is outside the scope of this document.

   The CDNI Request Routing interface is one of the main building blocks
   required in order to interconnect CDNs.  The main function of the
   Request Routing interface is to allow the Request Routing systems in
   interconnected CDNs to communicate to facilitate the redirection of
   User Agent requests between interconnected CDNs.

   The detailed requirements for the CDNI Request Routing interface and
   their relative priorities of those requirements are described in
   section 5 of [I-D.draft-cdni-requirements].

   The CDNI Request Routing interface operates between a pair of
   interconnected CDNs.  To enable communication over the CDNI Request
   Routing Interface, the two interconnected CDNs need to know the end
   point (URI) in the other CDN to query.  For example, an Upstream CDN
   needs to know the URI (end point) in a Downstream CDN to send its
   CDNI Request Routing queries to.

   The CDNI Request Routing URI may be statically pre-configured,
   dynamically discovered via the CDNI control interface, or discovered
   via other means.  However, such discovery mechanisms are not
   specified in this document, as they are considered out of the scope
   of the CDNI Request Routing Protocol.

   The CDNI Request Routing interface must support both of the request
   routing mechanisms illustrated in section 3.2 and 3.4 of [I-D.davie-
   cdni-framework], namely Interative Request Routing and Recursive
   Request Routing.  The Iterative Request Routing method does not
   invoke any interaction over the request routing interface across

   interconnected CDNs.  This document hence will not discuss Iterative
   Request Routing further.

   In the case of Recursive Request Routing, an Upstream CDN forwards a
   routing request from a user agent to a Downstream CDN for surrogate
   selection.  The initial candidate protocols for these interactions
   are DNS and HTTP.  Moreover, the inside routing mechanisms used
   between the CDN and the user agent (DNS and HTTP Redirection) of the
   two interconnected CDNs should also be taken into account as they may
   affect the type of query request the Upstream CDN send to a
   Downstream CDN and the information the Downstream CDN return in its
   query response.

3.1.  Discussion on protocol type for CDNI RRI

   The request routing process has several variants depending on the
   factors including:

      Which routing mechanism is adopted by an Upstream CDN inside, DNS
      Redirection or HTTP Redirection.

      Which protocol is adopted for the CDNI Request Routing Interface.

      Which routing mechanism is adopted by a Downstream CDN inside, DNS
      Redirection or HTTP Redirection.

   All possible combinations and their validity are shown in Table 1.

                   Table 1: Recursive Routing Cases

   The rules to filter the cases and determine the validity of them are
   discussed below.

   The Upstream CDN must not perform protocol conversion (A DNS query to
   an HTTP request or vice versa).  To assist the routing decision of a
   Downstream CDN, the Upstream CDN shall convey as much information as
   possible to the Downstream CDN, e.g.  URI of the requested content,
   the client's location information.  In the case of HTTP to DNS
   conversion, a DNS request cannot convey all the information an HTTP
   request contains.  In the case of DNS to HTTP conversion, a full HTTP
   URL cannot be constructed through a simple domain name contained by a
   DNS query request.  Hence it is concluded that the protocol type used
   in the CDNI Request Routing Interface will be consistent with the one
   the Upstream CDN received from the user agent.  Case3, Case6 are
   invalid according to this rule.

   The Downstream CDN can determine according to its local policy a DNS
   Redirection or an HTTP Redirection to be adopted.  When receiving a
   DNS query request over the CDNI Request Routing Interface.

   If DNS Redirection is selected, as the location information has been
   changed to the Upstream CDN's when it proxies the DNS query request,
   the Downstream CDN cannot get the user agent's location information
   from the query request.  The Downstream CDN sends a response with a
   CNAME of the hostname of the Request Router, so that the user agent
   issues another DNS query request which will convey its location
   information as shown in case2.  If HTTP Redirection is selected, the
   Downstream CDN sends a response with the IP address of its Request
   Router, so that it can receive a subsequent content request based on
   HTTP containing the client's location information, to allow selection
   of an appropriate surrogate as shown in case1.

   Based on filter rules above, Case 1, 2, and 4 are valid cases for
   CDNI.  The following section describes these cases in detail.


4.  Data passed in CDNI request routing requests & responses

   As to the data that have to be passed between the CDNI request
   routing requests and responses, we believe that besides End User's
   request/response, certain CDNI metadata or policies might also be
   required.  For example, in the CDNI request routing requests,
   appropriate CDNI Metadata could be introduced to aid the downstream
   CDN in making its decision.  In the response, some policies might be
   included and returned to the End User to indicate how the responses
   could be reused, e.g., "the same response can be used without asking
   me again provided the End User is in this IP Address range", etc.  As
   follows, detailed description of data that should be passed in the
   CDNI request routing requests and responses will be given
   respectively, considering under both DNS redirection and HTTP
   redirection mechanisms.

4.1.  Data passed in CDNI request routing  requests

   The data passed in CDNI request routing requests splits into two
   basic categories, an encapsulation of the User Agent's request to the
   upstream CDN; and properties/parameters that the uCDN can use to
   control the dCDN's response or that can help the dCDN make its
   decision.  Data passed in CDNI request routing requests are
   enumerated in Table 1, including both DNS request and HTTP request.

+------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------+

   Note: As we presented before, the downstream CDN needs to obtain the
   appropriate CDNI Metadata to know how to process the CDNI Request
   Routing requests.  We do not include actual CDNI Metadata in the CDNI
   Request Routing requests, only a link to the CDNI Metadata is
   included, shown in Table 1.

4.2.  Data passed in CDNI request routing responses

   There are also two basic categories of data passed in CDNI request
   routing responses, an encapsulation of the DNS response or HTTP
   response to return to the End User; parameters /policies that
   indicate the properties of the response, such as, whether it is
   cacheable, the scope of the response, etc.  Data passed in CDNI
   request routing responses are enumerated in Table 2, including both
   DNS response and HTTP response.

5.  HTTP based RESTful interface for CDNI Request Routing

   This document defines a simple HTTP based RESTful interface for CDNI
   Request Routing, where End User's requests are encapsulated along
   with links to appropriate CDNI Metadata resources (records) and any
   other data that can aid the downstream CDN in processing the
   requests.  The response encapsulates the response that the upstream
   CDN should return to the End User (if it decides to utilize the
   Downstream CDN for delivery) along with the policy for how the
   response could be reused (through standard HTTP Cache-Control
   headers).

   The same RESTful interface is used for both DNS and HTTP redirection
   of User Agent's requests, although the contents of the CDNI Request
   Routing Interface requests/responses contain data specific to either
   DNS or HTTP redirection.

   This approach has been chosen because it enables CDN operators to
   only have to deploy a single (RESTful) interface for request routing
   between their CDNs, regardless of the User Agent redirection method.
   In this way, from an operational point of view there is only one
   interface to monitor, manage, or develop troubleshooting tools for.

   In addition, having a single CDNI Request Routing interface where the
   User Agent's DNS or HTTP request are encapsulated along with the

   other data required for the downstream CDN to make a request routing
   decision, avoids having to try and encapsulate or proxy DNS/HTTP/
   RTMP/etc requests and find ways to somehow embed the additional CDNI
   Request Routing properties/data within those End User DNS/HTTP/RTMP/
   etc requests.

   Finally, the interface is easily extendable to support other User
   Agent request redirection methods (e.g.  RTMP 302 redirection).

   The general call flow between Request Routers in a pair of
   interconnected CDNs is as follows:
           User Agent                CDN B RR                  CDN A RR
               |UA Request (DNS or HTTP) |                         |
               |-------------------------------------------------->|
               |                         |                         |
               |                         |HTTP POST to CDN B's CDNI|
               |                         |RRI URI encapsulating UA | (1)

               |                         |                         |

               |                         |response to return to UA |

   1.  The User Agent sends its request, either CDN request or HTTP
   request etc., to CDN A. A Request Routing System of CDN A processes
   the request, and it recognizes that the request is best served by
   another CDN, specifically CDN B.

   2.  A Request Routing System of CDN A sends an HTTP POST to CDN B's
   CDNI Request Routing Interface URI encapsulating User Agent's
   request, as well as a link to the associated CDNI metadata, etc.,
   which may help CDN B make its decision when processing the request.

   3.  A Request Routing System of CDN B processes the request and
   replies an HTTP "200" Response with body containing encapsulation of
   protocol specific response (e.g., for DNS, CNAME of the dCDN's
   Request Router, and for HTTP, IP address or hostname of dCDN's
   Request Router) as well as parameters that indicate the properties of
   the response (e.g., parameter that indicate whether the response is
   cacheable) to return to the User Agent.

   4.  A Request Routing System of CDN B sends the protocol specific
   response to the User Agent, and then the User Agent's request will be
   redirect to the CDN B.


6.  Protocol Specification

   This section only specifies a brief introduction of different fields
   to be exchanged in Request Routing requests/responses, and the
   specific encoding for them will be presented in our future work.

6.1.  Recursive Request Routing

6.1.1.  DNS based Request Routing Protocol

6.1.1.1.  Upstream CDN Behavior

   Upon receiving a DNS query request from a User Agent, the Request
   Routing System of the Upstream CDN SHALL first determine an inside
   routing mechanism according to local policy.  If it is aware that the
   End User is best served by another CDN, the Upstream CDN SHALL select
   a Downstream CDN and forward the End User's request along with a link
   to the associated CDNI Metadata to the Downstream CDN, while the End
   User's request includes DNS Client IP address, type of query, real
   Client IP address (if know), and URI of requested content.

   Upon receiving a response from the Downstream CDN, the Request
   Routing System of the Upstream CDN shall forward it back to the User
   Agent.

6.1.1.2.  Downstream CDN Behavior

   Upon receiving a DNS query request, the Downstream CDN SHALL extracts
   End User's request information (e.g., the content provider's domain
   name) as well as associated CDNI Metadata to help it process the
   request.  It then SHALL determine an inside routing mechanism
   according to local routing policy.

   Editor's note: The local routing policy may take into account the
   CP's policy if existed identified by the CP's domain name.

   In case of DNS Redirection, it SHALL select a Request Router and
   return a response containing CNAME of the Downstream CDN's Request
   Router, as well as parameters/policies that indicate the properties
   of the response, such as, parameter that indicate whether the
   response is cacheable, parameter that indicate how long to reduce the
   number of subsequent CDNI Request Routing requests the Upstream CDN
   needs to make, and parameter that indicate the scope of the response

   (if it is cacheable).

   In the case of HTTP Redirection, it SHALL select a Request Router and
   return IP address or hostname of Request Router, as well as
   parameters/policies that indicate the properties of the response,
   such as, parameter that indicate whether the response is cacheable,
   parameter that indicate how long to reduce the number of subsequent
   CDNI Request Routing Requests the Upstream CDN needs to make, and
   parameter that indicate the scope of the response (if it is
   cacheable).

6.1.2.  HTTP based Request Routing Protocol

6.1.2.1.  Upstream CDN Behavior

   Upon receiving an HTTP Request from a User Agent for specific
   content, based on the local routing policy, if it is determined that
   the user is best served by another CDN, the Request Router of the
   Upstream CDN SHALL select a Downstream CDN for the End User,
   encapsulate the User Agent's request (Client IP address, request URL)
   with properties that Upstream CDN can use to control the dCDN's
   response (a link to the associated CDNI Metadata, whether to return
   hostnames or IP address in the redirection URL), and then forward the
   request to the selected Downstream CDN.

   After receiving an HTTP "200" response from the Downstream CDN, the
   Upstream CDN SHALL forward it back to the User Agent.

6.1.2.2.  Downstream CDN Behavior

   Upon receiving an HTTP Request, the Downstream CDN SHALL select a
   delivery node for the User Agent based on the local routing policy.
   It SHALL then return IP address or hostname of selected delivery
   node, as well as parameters/policies that indicate the properties of
   the response, such as, parameter that indicate whether the response
   is cacheable, parameter that indicate how long to reduce the number
   of subsequent CDNI Request Routing Requests the Upstream CDN needs to
   make, and parameter that indicate the scope of the response (if it is
   cacheable).

6.2.  Iterative Request Routing

   Editor's note: Whether any content relative to Iterative Request
   Routing should be added here is to be determined by the CDNI working
   group.

7.  Security Considerations

   In HTTP based Recursive Request Routing, the end user's web browsers
   will not send cookies if the content request is redirected to a URL
   in a different domain rather than the original CP's domain, e.g. the
   Downstream CDN's domain.  If the browser is expected to send any
   cookies associated with the original CP's domain, this will cause
   problem that the CP's policy is not enforced by the CDN.

   The section 5.2 of draft [I-D.draft-peterson-cdni-strawman] has
   discussed a similar question and given a solution.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
