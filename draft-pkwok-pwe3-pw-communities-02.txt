Abstract

   [RFC4447]describes a set of procedures for Pseudowire set-up and
   maintenance using LDP as signaling protocol.
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw] extends the mechanisms described in
   [RFC4447] for dynamic placement of multi- segment pseudowires.

   This document describes an extension to [RFC4447]procedures which may
   be used to pass additional information to S-PE/T-PEs when SS-PWs or
   MS-PWs are set-up.

   The intention of the proposed technique is to aid in policy
   administration, specifically during MS-PW set-up across various
   S-PEs.  The proposed method is very generic so that it can support
   the management of various parameters or rules while setting up
   pseudowires with minimal overhead.

Internet-Draft               PW Communities                 October 2011


1.  Introduction

   A Multi-Segment PW (MS-PW) is defined as a set of two or more
   contiguous segments that behave and function as a single point-to-
   point PW.  An MS-PW enables service providers to extend the reach of
   PWs across multiple PSN domains.

   To facilitate and simplify the control of dynamic MS-PW set-up across
   S-PEs, this document proposes a grouping or "community" of PWs so
   that PW set-up decision can also be based on the identity of the
   group.  Such a scheme is expected to significantly simplify dynamic
   MS-PW signaling [I-D.ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw] that controls the MS-PW
   set-up across the Switching Provider Edge (S-PE) devices.

   MS-PW spans across multiple autonomous systems or administrative
   domains.  For security reasons, strict access control is required at
   S-PEs through which a PW enters another administrative domain.  One
   way is for operators to define a policy at the S-PE that would match
   the PW set-up requests based on Target Attachment Individual
   Identifier (TAII) or Source Attachment Individual Identifier (SAII)
   or Attachment Group Identifier (AGI) etc.  Such policies can be
   complex or very large, leading to administrative overheads or
   configuration mistakes.  Rather, operators could define several tags/
   colors which can be associated with individual PWs when they are
   signaled.  S-PEs can then apply PW policies based on the received
   tags, accordingly.  This example application eliminates the primary
   motivation for a complex policy database that may result in the
   generation of very large PW prefix-based filter rules.  A smaller
   policy database such as this also requires less maintenance, so
   shortening or eliminating out-of-band maintenance delays.

   Another application of PW policies is in underlying transport
   applications.  Each S-PE independently chooses a unidirectional PSN
   tunnel to map a set of PW segments to their next S-PE or T-PE.  Such
   PSN Tunnels could be Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036] or
   Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) [RFC3209]
   or Labeled BGP [RFC3107] based LSPs.  There is currently no signaling
   support in [I-D.ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw] to signal a preference for
   the type of PSN tunnel to bind a PW to at the S-PEs when multiple
   tunnel types are available.  For example, LDP can be preferred over
   BGP tunnels when both forms of tunnels are available at an S-PE.
   Secondly, it is also possible that only a specific RSVP tunnel or
   class of RSVP tunnels based in Admin Groups is preferable to provide
   a traffic class or QoS treatment, or protection capability, and some
   form of control is required that LSPs are correctly used by S-PEs.
   One possible way is to manually configure filter rules by PW ID or
   AGI/SAII/TAII, but such rules can create significant maintenance
   overhead and be prone to configuration errors.  Further, signaling

   each of the various types of PSN tunnel selection criteria/
   preferences in PW set-up messages adds significant burden to LDP
   label mapping procedures.

   In Dynamic MS-PW, a T-PE or S-PE may need to choose one next-hop from
   several Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) next-hops provided by best
   matching PW Route.  One way to do ECMP selection is to apply some
   form of hash function on AGI/SAII/TAII of the PW but that strictly
   limits the MS-PW addressing schemes in order to get proper load
   distribution of MS-PWs across all next-hops.  Operators need a
   predictable way for load balancing MS-PW across ECMP next-hops which
   is independent of MS-PW addressing schemes.

   To address such policy management issues, this draft proposes a very
   simple solution that allows minimal manual intervention and
   configuration with no overhead in PW signaling.  It introduces a
   concept of "PW Communities" that can be thought of as templates
   provisioned at a S-PE/T-PE, based on which of a certain set of rules
   are applied to all PWs that are tagged as belonging to same
   community.

   Note that PW Community is different from PW Grouping (as defined
   using PW Group ID) defined in [RFC4447]].  PW Grouping is associated
   with binding of a set of PWs to a common event group for reduced
   signaling of various intensive events such as Label withdraw or PW
   Status Notification etc.  However, PW Communities can be thought of a
   grouping of PWs from policy management perspective.  It is not
   necessary that PW Grouping and PW Communities associated with a PW be
   correlated.


2.  PW Communities

   The PW Communities is an OPTIONAL TLV defined as follows which is in
   the format of LDP TLV [RFC5036].

   0                   1                   2                   3

   U/F bits MUST be set to 1.  Length is variable.  Value field of the
   TLV contains a set of "PW Communities".

   A PW Community is defined as follows:

   0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Type field indicates the specific PW Community Type.  The types are
   introduced to provide a broad classification of various PW
   communities based on the scope of applicability.  Each community type
   further provides the flexibility to define sub-types within it.
   Length of a PW community is variable and to be defined by Type and
   Sub-Type associated with a PW community.


3.  Defined PW Community Types

   This section introduces a few PW community types and defines the
   format of the PW Community for those types.

3.1.  PW Template Community

   A PW Template community (PW Community Type 0x01) can be considered as
   a template that has a set of rules defined locally by a T-PE or S-PE.
   Each T-PE or S-PE can define its own set of rules and its upto the
   administrative domain to maintain congruities among PW community
   rules through which PW set-up process would follow.  A LDP peer may
   use this community to control information it accepts, prefers or
   distributes to other peers.

   A LDP peer receiving a PW set-up request (label mapping message) that
   does not carry the PW Template Community MAY append a PW Template
   Community TLV when propagating the label mapping message to next
   S-PE/T-PE.

   A LDP peer receiving a PW set-up request with PW Template Community
   MAY modify the PW community according to local policy while
   propagating the request to the next-hop.  Following sub-types of PW
   Template Community are defined in this document.

3.1.1.  PW Generic Template Community

   PW Generic Template Community is defined as sub-type 0x1 of the PW
   Template Community.  The length field is 4 octets and contains a 32
   bit generic identifier.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+


3.2.  PW Color Community

   A PW Color community (PW Community type 0x2) can be considered as a
   "coloring" of the PW that may be used by T-PE and S-PE in performing
   various hash functions required during PW set-up.  One such
   application is in selection of PW signaling next-hop from multiple
   ECMP next-hops provided by the matching PW Route.

3.2.1.  PW Generic Color Community

   PW Generic Color Community is defined as sub-type 0x1 of the PW Color
   Community.  The length field is 4 octets and contains a 32 bit
   generic identifier.

   0                   1                   2                   3
