                      draft-lopez-pce-hpce-ted-00

Abstract

   The PCE architecture is well-defined and may be used to compute the
   optimal path for LSPS across domains in MPLS-TE and GMPLS networks.
   The Hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE) [RFC6805] was
   developed to provide an optimal path when the sequence of domains is
   not known in advance.  The procedure and mechanism for populating the
   Traffic Engineering Database (TED) with domain topology and link
   information used in H-PCE-based path computations is open to
   interpretation.  This informational document describes how topology
   dissemination mechanisms may be used to provide TE information
   between Parent and Child PCEs (within the H-PCE context).  In
   particular, it describes how BGP-LS might be used to provide inter-
   domain connectivity.  This document is not intended to define new
   extensions, it demonstrates how existing procedures and mechanisms
   may be used.

1.  Introduction

   In scenarios with multiple domains in both MPLS-TE and GMPLS
   networks, the hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE)
   Architecture, defined in [RFC6805], allows to obtain the optimum end-
   to-end path.  The architecture exploits a hierarchical relation among
   domains.

   [RFC6805] defines the architecture and requirements for the end-to-
   end path computation across domains.  The solution draft for the
   H-PCE [I-D.draft-ietf-pce-hierarchy-extensions-00] is focused on the
   PCEP protocol extensions to support such H-PCE procedures, including
   negotiation of capabilities and errors.  However, neither the
   architecture nor the solution draft specify which mechanism must to

   be used to build and populate the parent PCE (pPCE) Traffic
   Engineering Database (TED).

   The H-PCE architecture documents define the minimum content needed in
   the traffic engineering database required to compute paths.  The
   information required by parent TEDB are identified in [RFC6805] and
   further elaborated in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-pce-inter-area-as-applicability-03].  For instance,
   [RFC6805] and [I-D.draft-ietf-pce-inter-area-as-applicability-03]
   suggest that BGP-LS could be used as a "northbound" TE advertisement.
   This means that a PCE does not need to listen IGP in its domain, but
   its TED is populated by messages received (for example) from a Route
   Reflector.

   This document highlights the applicability of BGP-LS to the
   dissemination of domain topology within the H-PCE architecture.  In
   particular, it describes how can BGP-LS be used to send the inter-
   domain connectivity.  It also shows how can OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE
   updates be mapped into BGP-LS.

   Note that this document is not intended to define new protocol
   extensions, it is an informational document and where required it
   highlights where existing mechanisms and protocols may be applied.

1.1.  Parent PCE Domain Topology

   The pPCE maintains a domain topology map of the child domains and
   their interconnectivity.  This map does not include any visibility
   into the child domains.  Where inter-domain connectivity is provided
   by TE links, the capabilities of those links may also be known to the
   pPCE.  The pPCE maintains a TED for the parent domain, the nodes in
   the parent domain are abstractions of the cPCE domains (connected by
   real or virtual TE links), but the pPCE domain may also include real
   nodes and links.

   The procedure and protocol mechanism for disseminating and
   construction of the pPCE TED may be provided using a number of
   mechanisms, including manually configuring the necessary information
   or automated using a separate instance of a routing protocol to
   advertise the domain interconnectivity.  Since inter-domain TE links
   can be advertised by the IGPs operating in the child domains, this
   information could then be exported to the parent PCE either by the
   child PCEs or using north-bound export mechanisms.

1.2.  Parent PCE TED requirements

   The information that would be exchanged includes:

Internet-Draft                  TED-HPCE                    October 2013


   o  Identifier of advertising child PCE.

   o  Identifier of PCE's domain.

   o  Identifier of the link.

   o  TE properties of the link (metrics, bandwidth).

   o  Other properties of the link (technology-specific).

   o  Identifier of link endpoints.

   o  Identifier of adjacent domain.

2.  H-PCE Domain Topology Dissemination and Construction Methods

   A variety of methods exist to provide are different alternatives so
   the parent PCE can get the topological information from the child
   PCEs (cPCEs):

   o  Statically configure all inter-domain link and topology
      information.

   o  Membership of an IGP instance.  The necessary topological
      information could be disseminated by joining the IGP instance of
      each child PCE domain.  However, by doing so, it would break the
      domain confidentiality principles and is subject to scalability
      issues.

   o  PCEP Notification Messages.  Another solution is to send the
      interconnection information between domains using PCEP
      Notifications (see section 4.8.4 of [RFC6805]).  One approach,
      followed in research work, is embedding in PCEP Notifications the
      Inter-AS OSPF-TE Link State Advertisements (LSA) to send the
      Inter-Domain Link information from child PCEs to the parent PCE
      and to send reachability information (list of end-points in each
      domain).  However, it is argued that the utilization of PCEP to
      disseminate topology is beyond scope of the protocol.

   o  Separate IGP instance.  [RFC6805] points out that in models such
      as ASON it is possible to consider a separate instance of an IGP
      running within the parent domain where the participating protocol
      speakers are the nodes directly present in that domain and the
      PCEs (parent and child PCEs).

   o  Use north-bound distribution of TE information.  The North-Bound
      Distribution of Link-State and TE Information using BGP has been
      recently propose in the IEFT

      [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution-03].  This approach is known
      as BGP-LS and defines a mechanism by which links state and traffic
      engineering information can be collected from networks and
      exported to external elements using the BGP routing protocol.  By
      using BGP-LS as northbound distribution mechanism, there would be
      a BGP speaker in each domains that sends the necessary information
      to a BGP speaker in the parent domain.  This architecture is
      further elaborated in this document.

3.  H-PCE architecture using BGP-LS

   As mentioned in [I-D.draft-dugeon-pce-ted-reqs-01] PCE has to
   retrieve Traffic Engineering (TE) information to carry out its path
   computation.  This is required not only for intra-domain information,
   which can be got using IGP (like OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE), but also for
   inter-domain information in the Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE)
   architecture.

   Figure 1 shows an example of a H-PCE architecture.  In this example,
   there is a parent PCE and three child PCEs, and they are organized in
   multiple domains.  The parent PCE does not have information of the
   whole network, but is only aware of the connectivity among the
   domains and provides coordination to the child PCEs.  Figure 2 shows
   which is the visibility that parent PCE has from the network
   according to the definition in [RFC6805].

   Thanks to this topological information, when there is a request to a
   child PCE with the destination in another domain, this path request
   is sent to the parent PCE, which selects a set of candidate domain
   paths and sends requests to the child PCEs responsible for these
   domains.  Then, the parent PCE selects the best solution and it is
   transmitted to the source PCE.

                 Figure 2: Parent PCE topology information

   Thanks to the dissemination of inter-domain adjacency information
   from each cPCE to the pPCE, the pPCE can have a view of reachability
   between the domains.  The H-PCE architecture with BGP-LS is shown in
   Figure 3.  Each domain has a cPCE that is able to compute paths in
   the domain.  This child PCE has access to a domain TED, which is
   built using IGP information.  In each domain, a BGP speaker has
   access to such domain TED and acts as BGP-LS Route Reflector to
   provide network topology to the pPCE.  Next to the pPCE, there is a
   BGP speaker that maintains a BGP session with each of the BGP
   speakers in the domains to receive the topology and build the parent
   TED.  A policy can be applied to the BGP-LS speakers to decide which
   information is sent to its peer speaker.  The minimum amount of
   information that needs to be exchanged is the inter-domain
   connectivity, including the details of the Traffic Engineering Inter-
   domain Links [RFC6805].  With this information, the parent PCE is
   able to have access to a domain topology map and its connectivity.
   Additionally, the BGP-LS speaker can be configured to send the

   complete list of TE Links, including its details.  In this case, the
   parent PCE has access to an extended database, with visibility of
   both intra-domain and inter-domain information and can compute the
   sequence of domains with better accuracy.  Even, the pPCE could have
   enough information to compute the whole end-to-end path by itself.

   BGP-LS [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution-03] extends the BGP Update
   messages to advertise link-state topology thanks to new BGP Network
   Layer Reachability Information (NLRI).  The Link State information is
   sent in two BGP attributes, the MP_REACH (defined in [RFC4670]) and a
   LINK_STATE attribute (defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution-03]).  To describe the inter
   domain links, in the MP_REACH attribute, a Link NLRI can be used with
   the local node descriptors the address of the source, and in the
   remote descriptors, the address of the destination of the link.  The
   Link Descriptors field has a TLV (Link Local/Remote Identifiers),
   which carries the prefix of the Unnumbered or Numbered Interface.  In
   case of the message informs about an intra-domain link, the standard
   traffic engineering information is included in the LINK_STATE
   attribute.
