          Tree Notification to Improve Multicast Fast Reroute
                  draft-wijnands-rtgwg-mcast-frr-tn-00

Abstract

   This draft proposes using dataplane triggered notifications in order
   to support multicast fast reroute methods in various ways.  Sending
   such notifications down the tree can be used to trigger fail-over in
   nodes not adjacent to the failure.  Sending such dataplane
   notification up the tree can help to activate pre-built standby
   backup tree segments.

1.  Terminology and Definitions

   MoFRR :   Multicast only Fast Re-Route.

   LFA :   Loop Free Alternate.

   mLDP :   Multi-point Label Distribution Protocol.

   PIM :   Protocol Independent Multicast.

   UMH :   Upstream Multicast Hop, a candidate next-hop that can be used
      to reach the root of the tree.

   tree :   Either a PIM (S,G)/(*,G) tree or a mLDP P2MP or MP2MP LSP.

   OIF :   Outgoing InterFace, an interface used to forward multicast
      packets down the tree towards the receivers.  Either a PIM
      (S,G)/(*,G) tree or a mLDP P2MP or MP2MP LSP.

   IIF :   Incoming InterFace, an interface where multicast traffic is
      received by a router.

   MCE :   MultiCast Egress, the last node where the multicast stream
      exits the current transport technology (MPLS-mLDP or IP-PIM)
      domain or administrative domain.  This maybe the router attached
      to a multicast receiver.

   MCI :   MultiCast Ingress, the node where the multicast stream enters
      the current transport technology (MPLS-mLDP or IP-PIM) domain.
      This maybe the router attached to the multicast source.

   UTNP :   Upstream Tree Notification Packet.

   TNP :   Tree Notification Packet, Upstream or Downstream

   JM :   Join Message, the message used to join to a multicast tree,
      i.e. to build up the tree.  In PIM, this is a JOIN message, while
      in mLDP this corresponds to a LabelMap message.

   MRT :  Maximally Redundant Trees.

   Repair Node :  The node performing a dual-join to the tree through
      two different UMHs.  Sometimes also called as dual-joining node or
      merging node (it merges the secondary and primary tree).

   Branching Node :  A node, (i) which is considered as being on the
      primary tree by its immediate UMH and (ii) which has at least one
      secondary type of OIF installed for a multicast tree.


2.  Introduction

   Both [I-D.karan-mofrr] and [I-D.atlas-rtgwg-mrt-mc-arch] describe
   "live-live" multicast protection, where a node joins a tree via
   different candidate upstream multicast hops (UMH).  With MoFRR the
   list of candidate UMHs can come from either ECMP or Loop Free
   Alternate (LFA) paths towards the MultiCast Ingress node (MCI).  With
   MRT, the candidate UMHs are determined by looking up the MCI in two
   different (Red and Blue) topologies.  In either case, the multicast
   traffic is simultaneously received over different paths/topologies
   for the same tree.  The node 'dual-joining' the tree needs a
   mechanism to prevent duplicate packets being forwarding to the end
   user.  For that reason a node 'dual-joining' the tree only accepts
   packets from one of the UMHs at the time.  Which UMH is preferred is
   a local decision that can be based on IGP reachability, link status,
   BFD, traffic flow monitoring, etc...

   Should the node detect a local failure on the primary UMH, the node
   has an instantly available secondary UMH that is can switch to,
   simply by unblocking the secondary UMH.  The dual-joining node is
   also called Repair Node in the following.

   This draft attempts to improve these solutions by:

   o  Improving fail-over time and the reliability of failure detection
      for non-local failures; and

   o  Reducing the bandwidth consumption in a failure-free network.


3.  Improving non-local failures

   If a failure is not local and happens further upstream, the dual-
   joining node needs a fast and reliable mechanism (i) to detect the
   upstream failure and (ii) to learn that other upstream nodes cannot
   circumvent the failure.  Existing methods based on traffic monitoring
   are limited in scope and work best with a steady state packet flow.
   Therefore, we propose a method which can trigger the unblocking
   independently of the packet flow.

   Figure 1 shows an example.  Consider that, e.g., node A goes down.
   Nodes C, D and E cannot detect that locally, so they need to resort
   to other means.  After detecting the failure, node C should not



Wijnands, et al.         Expires April 18, 2013                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     Tree Notification for Multicast FRR      October 2012


   change to its secondary UMH (node J) as it won't help for the failure
   of A. Node D, on the other hand, will have to unblock its secondary
   UMH (node I).  Yet again, with MoFRR, node E should not unblock its
   secondary UMH (node K): (i) this won't help in resolving the failure
   of node A, and (ii) one of its upstream nodes (node D in this case)
   will be able to restore the stream with a fail-over action.

3.1.  Downstream Tree Notifications

   The node detecting a local failure of its primary UMH MUST originate
   a Downstream Tree Notification Packet (DTNP) to all downstream
   branches of the tree.  Each router that receives the DTNP determines
   if it is a Repair Node for that tree.  If it is not a Repair Node,
   the DTNP is forwarded further down the tree.  If the node is the
   Repair Node, the secondary UMH is unblocked and the DTNP is
   discarded.  The DTNP allows a downstream router to unambigously
   identify the multicast tree impacted by the failure.

   In order to decrease reaction time, the DTNP SHOULD be originated
   from the data plane when a local failure is detected, as well as
   processed in the data plane when the DTNP is received.  All the
   information necessary to send and receive a DTNP has to be available
   in the data plane in advance.

3.2.  DTNP processing/forwarding

   When a DTNP is received from an UMH, the node MUST check

   o  whether it has a secondary UMH, and if yes,

   o  whether this particular DTNP was received on the primary or
      secondary UMH, and

   o  whether another DTNP had been received beforehand from the other
      UMH.

   Whenever a node receives a DTNP from its primary UMH and the node has
   a secondary UMH for which no DTNP had been received beforehand, this
   node could be a Repair Node, so unblocks its secondary UMH.  The DTNP
   MUST not be forwarded, but the node has to store the fact that a DTNP
   has been received for the primary UMH for this multicast tree.

   If a node receives a DTNP from its primary UMH but does not have a
   secondary UMH, this node is not the Repair Node and MUST forward the
   DTNP.

   If a node receives two DTNPs, one from the primary UMH and another
   one from the secondary UMH, then this node is not the Repair Node and



Wijnands, et al.         Expires April 18, 2013                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     Tree Notification for Multicast FRR      October 2012


   it MUST forward the last received DTNP to all branches of the tree.
   (Secondary UMH does not need to be unblocked since it cannot remedy
   the failure.)

   A DTNP received only from the secondary UMH MUST NOT be forwarded,
   but the node has to store the fact that a DTNP has been received for
   the secondary UMH for this multicast tree.

   Whenever a decision has been taken to originate or forward a DTNP, it
   will be automatically replicated to all downstream legs, given that
   it is a multicast packet.  DTNP MUST be replicated also to downstream
   stand-by legs if such legs exist.

   It would raise security issues if DTNPs propagated outside the
   operator network, so MCEs MUST prevent that DTNP packets propagate to
   receivers or to other domains.  Rephrased, nodes MUST NOT forward
   DTNPs to legs that lead to receivers or to external autonomous
   systems.

   As an example, consider Figure 1.  If node A fails, B detects the
   failure locally and triggers a DTNP (towards C).  Node C is not the
   Repair Node because it will receive the DTNP from both the primary
   UMH (from B) and the secondary UMH (from J).  Because node C is not
   the Repair node it will forward the DTNP towards K and D (observing
   rule 3.).  K does not have a secondary UMH for this tree, so it will
   send the DTNP downstream towards E (rule 2.).  Node D has a secondary
   UMH, so it applies rule 1.  Node E applies rule 4.  As a result,
   subscribers sitting at or below nodes D and E will continue receiving
   the multicast traffic.

4.  Reduce the bandwidth consumption in failure-free network

   In some of networks, such as aggregation networks, bandwidth is more
   sparse than, e.g., in core networks.  Live-live multicast protection
   results in traffic duplication in the failure-free network as it
   continuously uses bandwidth for both trees or segments.  In such
   networks it is relevant if the capacity serving backup purposes can
   be used in the failure-free network, i.e., most of the time, by best-
   effort or even by lower-than-best-effort traffic.

                 +-+
                 |C|
                 +-+

        Nodes A and B have receivers.  Double lines show bandwidth
      consumption that is superfluous when there is no failure in the
                                 network.

   Figure 2: Example for secondary segments occupying bandwidth in MoFRR

   In live-standby mode the aim is that the secondary tree or secondary
   tree segments are not loaded with multicast traffic as long as there
   is no failure.  A "live-standby" type of multicast protection method,
   however, requires two principal components:

   o  Blocking OIFs at branching points in the secondary tree to avoid
      sending secondary packets in the first place; and

   o  Simple and fast-enough procedures to be able to activate the
      standby tree or standby tree-segment.

4.1.  Upstream Tree Notifications

   The UTN mechanism requires that the secondary tree or tree segment
   was built with dedicated backup status.  In MoFRR or MRT live-live
   mode the secondary tree and tree segments are active, only the merge
   point, i.e. the Repair Node, keeps the secondary incoming interface
   blocked.  Dedicated backup status means that the OIFs corresponding
   to the secondary tree are installed into the data plane but they are
   installed with a flag denoting they are blocked.  Packets are not
   forwarded to these interfaces unless an Upstream Tree Notification
   Packet (UTNP) activates them.

Internet-Draft     Tree Notification for Multicast FRR      October 2012


   Sending notifications upstream helps facilitating live-standby mode
   instead of live-live.  Whenever a node detects a failure on the
   primary tree (the failure being upstream from the node's location), a
   UTNP SHOULD be sent upstream towards the source on the secondary tree
   segment.  It is to be noted that the reception of a DTNP MAY be used
   as an upstream failure indication, so it MAY trigger sending a UTNP.
   The UTNP activates the secondary tree segments at branching nodes,
   i.e., unblocks the secondary OIFs.

   Both the secondary JM and the UTNP go up the tree until a branching
   node is reached.  The branching node is

   o  in a single topology environment: a node that is part of the
      primary tree and that also has a secondary leg; or

   o  the MCI.

4.2.  Joining a tree in dedicated backup status

   The secondary join process is almost identical to what the MRT and
   MoFRR drafts describe, i.e., a repair node simply sends a secondary
   JM through another UMH (on another topology, in case of MRT).

   For UTN, the secondary JM, however, has to explicitly indicate the
   intended dedicated backup status.  The backup indication MUST be an
   opaque and transitive indication, so that legacy nodes transparently
   keep the indication when sending the backup JM further up.  In the
   following, such a JM will be called as "backup JM".  How a JM may
   indicate its secondary status is protocol specific and will be
   discussed in the appropriate chapter below.

4.2.1.  Single topology environment

   In a single topology environment (MoFRR), the repair node sends the
   secondary backup JM through a second UMH of its choice.  From that
   UMH on, the backup JM is routed towards the source as if it was a
   regular JM.  In every node, the backup JM MUST be processed
   identically to a regular JM (including adding a new entry to the OIF
   list), but, in addition, the added OIF MUST be marked with "blocked"
   flag.  Traffic MUST NOT be forwarded through this interface for this
   multicast tree while in blocked status.

   If a node receives a primary JM after receiving a secondary JM from
   the same neighbor, the node MUST reset the corresponding OIF entry to
   "unblocked" state.  Furthermore, the primary JM MUST be sent further
   upwards if the node had no other "unblocked" OIFs, i.e., if the node
   has not received a primary JM from any other neighbor for the given
   multicast tree.

Internet-Draft     Tree Notification for Multicast FRR      October 2012


4.2.2.  Multi-Topology Environment

   In a multi-topology environment (MRT), the secondary tree is built
   completely independent of the primary tree, on a second topology.
   This topology ID is attached to the backup JM.  Not only the repair
   node, but each following node receiving the backup JM will route the
   backup JM towards the source on the second topology.  The dedicated
   backup indication MUST be separated from the topology ID, i.e. a
   legacy node could send JMs on the secondary topology but will not set
   the dedicated backup flag.

4.3.  Activation

   UTNP SHOULD be originated when an upstream failure has been detected
   on the primary multicast tree and the node has a secondary UMH
   installed with stand-by status.  Note that the upstream failure may
   mean not only the (directly connected) UMH, but any failure up to the
   MCI.  Such an upstream failure may be detected in several ways (out
   of scope).  We note, however, that the reception of a DTNP from the
   primary UMH MAY be used as such a trigger.

   The UTNP activates the blocked OIF on which it was received.  The
   UTNP is forwarded up until a branching node is reached, which
   discards the UTNP and starts forwarding multicast traffic on the leg
   from where the UTNP was received (e.g., after unblocking the
   respective OIF).  If the branching node does not consider itself a
   reliable forwarder of the multicast traffic of the indicated tree
   (e.g., it received a failure indication in the form of a DTNP), it
   also sent a UTNP after receiving that indication to its secondary
   UMH, given it had one.

4.4.  MRT/MCI-Only Mode

   If each node in the network supports UTN and also all nodes support
   MRT, the nodes may work in "MRT/MCI-only" mode.

   In MRT/MCI-only mode, there is one single branching point for all
   failures, the MCI.  Other nodes MUST NOT consider themselves as
   branching nodes.  MRT ensures the necessary maximally disjoint
   secondary tree up to the MCI, on a second topology.  Only the MCI
   MUST keep its OIFs corresponding to the secondary tree blocked.
   Similarly, only MCEs MUST keep their secondary backup IIFs blocked.
   Any other nodes MUST NOT block their (secondary) IIFs or OIFs.

   In MRT/MCI-only mode, UTNP MUST be forwarded directly to the MCI.
   The mode enables that a node detecting a downstream failure of the
   primary tree MAY send a UTNP upstream towards the source/MCI on the
   primary tree.

Internet-Draft     Tree Notification for Multicast FRR      October 2012


   If an UTNP is received by the MCI on the secondary topology in "MRT/
   MCI-only" mode, the MCI MUST unblock the OIF where the UTNP was
   received.  This activates a whole sub-tree of the secondary tree.

   If an UTNP is received by the MCI on the primary topology in "MRT/
   MCI-only" mode, the MCI gets no information on which leg to activate
   on the secondary tree, so it MUST activate (unblock) all secondary
   legs.


5.  The TN Packet

5.1.  TN Packet Format

   TimeStamp:   The TimeStamp is the time-of-day (in seconds and
      microseconds, according to the sender's clock) in NTP format [NTP]
      when the Tree Notification is sent.

5.2.  Origination of TN Packets

   TN packets SHOULD be pre-loaded to the data plane cards, e.g. to a
   buffer, so that the packet only needs to be flushed when needed.
   This minimizes the incurred delay.

   One TN packet MUST be sent per affected multicast tree.  This does
   not lead to a scalability problem in practical network deployments,
   where it is not expected that a node has to send more than a few
   1000s of TN packets.


6.  IP/PIM Specific TN Components

   The TN UDP datagram is encapsulated in an IP packet with (S,G) set as
   source and destination in the IP header.  Such a TN packet is
   originated for each affected (S,G) multicast tree.  The UDP
   portnumber is set to an IANA assigned number for PIM TN.

6.1.  IP/PIM Downstream Tree Notifications

   As explained before, DTNP is multicasted on each tree on each
   outgoing interface (including potential "standby" OIFs).  If a node
   is a potential repair node for a multicast tree, the IP forwarding
   engine MUST be programmed so that it monitors DTNP packets, which are
   to be recognized among the (S,G) normal data packets based on their
   UDP port number.  If a DTNP is recognized, the affected tree can be
   identified from the IP header's source and destination address
   fields.

   As noted in Section 3.2, nodes MUST NOT forward DTNP outside the
   operator domain.  I.e., nodes egressing the domain MUST filter and
   discard DTNP packets on their egress interfaces.

   The DTN mechanism does not require any update of PIM related
   specifications.

6.2.  IP/PIM Upstream Tree Notifications

   An originated UTNP is to be sent upstream to the secondary UMH, i.e.,
   upstream through the secondary incoming interface.  The forwarding
   engine MUST be programmed so that despite the UTNP packet having
   (S,G) in the IP header, it MUST forward the UTNP packet upstream.
   (U)TN(P) packets are to be recognized based on their UDP port number.

Internet-Draft     Tree Notification for Multicast FRR      October 2012


   Only nodes that have installed some OIFs in blocked (backup) status
   need to keep monitoring for UTNP packets.

   The UTN mechanism requires that, when a node performs a secondary
   join, the PIM JOIN message indicates its dedicated "standby" status.
   Such an indication is required so that the recipient of a standby PIM
   JOIN can recognise that it can install its interface, through which
   the standby PIM JOIN was received, into the OIF list in blocked
   state.  (A received UTNP could be one trigger to unblock such a
   backup OIF.)  An extension of PIM JOIN messages and mechanisms is the
   responsibility of the PIM WG.  It is to be noted that a secondary
   status indication has already been proposed to the IETF in
   [I-D.liu-pim-single-stream-multicast-frr].

6.3.  Incremental deployment

   The DTNP can be forwarded by legacy nodes as a data packet.  So DTN
   can be deployed incrementally if the failure detecting node and
   repair nodes support it.

   In case of UTN, the (S,G) addressed (U)TN(P) packet MUST be forwarded
   towards to source, upstream.  This is in contrast to the normal
   forwarding procedures for (S,G) packets.  This means that legacy
   nodes cannot forward such packets.  It remains to be studied if the
   UTNP packet can be a unicast packet sent towards the source or MCI,
   or if the UTNP packet can be tunneled through legacy nodes.  In the
   current version of the spec, legacy nodes cannot handle UTNP.  As a
   consequence, a node supporting this spec MUST NOT send dedicated
   backup JOIN messages to a legacy node.

   Detecting the capability of supporting Tree Notifications can be done
   via capability advertisement.  This should be specified by the PIM
   WG.  As an indication, it is likely that a "TN-Capable" PIM-Hello
   option needs to be standardized.


7.  mLDP Specific TN Components

   Since MPLS is used as transport technology, the UTN and DTN are
   forwarded up and down the LSP using MPLS encapsulation.  The MPLS
   label pushed onto the TN is the label associated with the MP LSP
   impacted by the failure.  This follows more of less the same
   mechanism as described in [RFC4379].  Its important that a TN packet
   is never IP forwarded when the tail of the MP LSP is reached.  In
   order to prevent IP forwarding, the destination address MUST be set
   to an address from the 127/8 range for IPv4 and that same range
   embedded in as IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.  The source address in the
   IP header MUST be set to an address local to the router.  The UDP

   port number is set to an IANA assigned number for mLDP TN.

7.1.  mLDP Downstream Tree Notification

7.1.1.  Originating a DTNP

   As documented in section Section 3.1, a Downstream Tree Notification
   is sent by a router that detects a failure of an upstream link or
   node.  The DTN packet is then sent to each LDP neighbor in the
   Outgoing Interface List for each MP LSP impact by the failure using
   the MPLS Label that this neighbor has assigned for that MP LSP.

7.1.2.  Receiving a DTNP

   A Downstream Tree Notification Packet is received inline with the
   data on a particular LSP.  If the receiving router is a Repair Node,
   the MPLS forwarding logic will monitor the MPLS packets in order to
   detect the DTN packet based on the UDP port number assigned for mLDP
   TN.  When a DTNP is detected, the outer MPLS label identifies the
   LSP.  No additional mechanism or lookups are needed here.  The MPLS
   forwarding code can immediately activate the standby upstream path
   and disable the old primary path following the procedures described
   in Section 3.2

7.1.3.  Forwarding a DTNP

   If a router is not a Repair Node for a particular LSP it does not
   need to monitor the incoming traffic for that LSP in order to detect
   the DFN packet.  Such a router will just forward the DTN packet down
   the LSP as normal data.  Also, routers that don't support DTN
   processing will always just forward a DTN packet as normal data.  For
   the network to benefit from this feature, not all routers need to be
   DTN capable.

7.2.  mLDP Upstream Tree Notification

7.2.1.  Originating a UTNP

   Following the procedures as described in Section 4.1, an UTNP MAY
   need to be originated and sent to an upstream LDP neighbor.  A P2MP
   LSP has no upstream labeled path to reach the root because a P2MP LSP
   is unidirectional.  In order to create an upstream path that follows
   the P2MP LSP all the way up towards the root we apply the procedures
   are documented in [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-hsmp].  A MP2MP LSP already has
   an upstream path to the root of the tree, however, these packets are
   also forwarded down the tree by other LSRs.  There are two possible
   approuches, an LSRs that received a DTNP on an upstream interface may
   just choose to ignore these packets, or an LSR may filter out DTNP

   packets from ever being forwarded down the tree.  More details will
   be added in later revisions of the draft.

7.2.2.  Receiving a UTNP

   An Upstream Tree Notification is received on the upstream path
   associated with the MP LSP by node U. If router U has a downsteam
   interface in that MP LSPs OIF list that was joined in standby, it
   will move that interface to forwarding.  The outer label in the MPLS
   header will identify the MP LSP that is targeted.  However, that does
   not necessarily identify the downstream LDP neighbor and interface
   that needs to be put in forwarding state.  Following the procedures
   in [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-hsmp] node U MAY assign all the downstream LDP
   neighbors the same label for the upstream path.  For the purpose of
   UTN, node U MUST assign a unique label for each downstream LDP
   neighbor.  If that Label is unique, the UTNP will identify the MP LSP
   and the downstream LDP neighbor.  Since node U has selected the
   downstream interface, it knows which interface to put in forwarding
   mode.

7.2.3.  Forwarding a UTNP

   A UTNP has to be forward upstream towards the root of the MP LSP
   following the procedures as defined in Section 4.3

   The authors would like express their thanks for Gabor Enyedi for
   initial discussions.  The authors would also like to thank Stefan
   Olofsson and Javed Asghar for commenting on the draft.


9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate UDP port numbers to TN messages.  One
   port number for TN in IP/PIM context, and another one for MPLS/mLDP
   context.  The separation of UDP port numbers between IP and MPLS is
   requested to prevent problems when a PIM multicast tree is
   transported partly through an mLDP multicast tree.


10.  Security Considerations

   Two types of security problems can be foreseen by the authors:

   o  Handling illegally injected TN packets

Internet-Draft     Tree Notification for Multicast FRR      October 2012


   o  Handling replay attacks (re-injecting previous TN messages)

   o  TN messages propagating outside an operator's domain

   Illegal TN packets can be handled with authentication checks.
   Providing authentication for TN messages will be considered in later
   revisions of this spec.

   Prevention of replay attacks needs authentication in combination with
   sequence numbering.

   Preventing TN messages that travel inline with data packets MUST be
   solved by nodes egressing the operator's domain.  Solutions for IP
   and MPLS are described in sections Section 6 and Section 7,
   respectively.
