Internet-Draft     Link Type Registrations for OAuth 2      October 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines the link type [RFC5988] registrations for the
   OAuth 2 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] authentication framework.  It also
   defines link type registrations for OAuth 1.0a [RFC5849].  These link
   types are used during the endpoint discovery process using Web Host
   Metadata [RFC6415] and Webfinger [I-D.ietf-appsawg-webfinger] by
   clients needing to discover the authorization, token, and initiation
   endpoints for a service or site.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms used in the OAuth
   2.0 specification [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2].

   In examples line breaks have been inserted for readability.

   Note that the IMAP SASL specification requires base64 encoding
   message, not this memo.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document is informational, defining values in existing
   registries, and as such has no security properties to discuss.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Link Type Registration

   Pursuant to [RFC5988] The following link type registrations [[will
   be]] registered by mail to link-relations@ietf.org.

4.1.1.  OAuth 2 Authorization Endpoint

   o  Relation Name: oauth2-authorize

   o  Description: An OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint.

   o  Reference: [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2]

   o  Notes: This link type indicates an OAuth 2.0 authorization
      endpoint that can be used for user authentication/authorization
      for the endpoint providing the link.

   o  Application Data: [optional]

4.1.2.  OAuth 2 Token Endpoint

   o  Relation Name: oauth2-token

   o  Description: The OAuth token endpoint used to get tokens for
      access.

   o  Reference: [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2]

   o  Notes: The OAuth 2.0 token endpoint to be used for obtaining
      tokens to access the endpoint providing the link.

   o  Application Data: This link type has two link-extensions:

      grant-types:  A space separated list of OAuth 2.0 grant types (see
         section 4 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2]) that can be used at the token
         endpoint to obtain a token.  This is not an exclusive list, it
         provides a hint to the application of what SHOULD be valid.  A
         token endpoint MAY support additional grant types not
         advertised by a discovery service.  The client MAY use this to
         determine the grant types available for use.

      token-types:  A space separated list of OAuth 2.0 token types (see
         section 7.1 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2]) that may be issued by the
         token endpoint.  It is possible for a token endpoint to issue
         multiple tokens, and types may vary based on scope or other
         factors.  This is not an exclusive list, it provides a hint to

         the application of what SHOULD be valid, and it MAY be used by
         a client to determine if the client supports one or more of the
         token type(s) available.

4.1.3.  OAuth 1.0a Request Initiation Endpoint

   o  Relation Name: oauth-initiate

   o  Description: The OAuth 1.0a request initiation endpoint used to
      get an access request.

   o  Reference: [RFC5849]

   o  Notes: The OAuth 1.0a endpoint used to initiate the sequence, this
      temporary request is what the user approves to grant access to the
      resource.

   o  Application Data:

4.1.4.  OAuth 1.0a Authorization Endpoint

   o  Relation Name: oauth-authorize

   o  Description: The OAuth 1.0a authorization endpoint used to approve
      an access request.

   o  Reference: [RFC5849]

   o  Notes:

   o  Application Data:

4.1.5.  OAuth 1.0a Token Endpoint

   o  Relation Name: oauth-token

   o  Description: The OAuth 1.0a token endpoint used to exchange an
      approved access request for a token.

   o  Reference: [RFC5849]

   o  Notes:

   o  Application Data:
