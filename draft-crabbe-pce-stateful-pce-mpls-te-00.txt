Internet-Draft  Stateful PCE extensions for MPLS-TE LSPs    October 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to
   provide stateful control.  This document describes the objects and
   TLVs to be used with these PCEP extensions to control Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
   LSP) via a stateful PCE.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCC,
   PCE, PCEP Peer.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC4090]: MPLS TE
   Fast Reroute (FRR), FRR One-to-One Backup, FRR Facility Backup.

   This document uses the following terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] : Passive Stateful PCE, Active Stateful
   PCE, Delegation, Delegation Timeout Interval, LSP State Report, LSP
   Update Request, LSP Priority, LSP State Database, Revocation.

   Within this document, when describing PCE-PCE communications, the
   requesting PCE fills the role of a PCC.  This provides a saving in
   documentation without loss of function.

   The message formats in this document are specified using Routing
   Backus-Naur Format (RBNF) encoding as specified in [RFC5511].


3.  Motivation

   Several use cases for stateful PCE in an MPLS-TE network are included
   in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].


4.  MPLS-TE specific descriptors used in PCEP Messages

   As defined in [RFC5440], a PCEP message consists of a common header
   followed by a variable-length body made of a set of objects that can
   be either mandatory or optional.  [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   describes the messages and objects needed in support of stateful PCE.
   The following sections contain MPLS-TE specific descriptors used in
   some of these messages.

Internet-Draft  Stateful PCE extensions for MPLS-TE LSPs    October 2012


4.1.  MPLS-TE specific descriptors for the PCRpt Message

   The format of the PCRpt message is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] as follows, and included here for easy
   reference:

      <PCRpt Message> ::= <Common Header>
                          <state-report-list>
   Where:

      <state-report-list> ::= <state-report>[<state-report-list>]

      <state-report> ::= <LSP>
                         [<path-list>]

   Where:

      <path-list>::=<path>[<path-list>]

   For MPLS-TE LSPs, the path descriptor is defined as follows:

      <path>::=<ERO><attribute-list>

   Where:

       <attribute-list> ::= [<LSPA>]
                            [<BANDWIDTH>]
                            [<RRO>]
                            [<metric-list>]

       <metric-list> ::= <METRIC>[<metric-list>]

   The LSP State Report MAY contain a path descriptor for the primary
   path and one or more path descriptors for backup paths.  A path
   descriptor MUST contain an ERO object as it was specified by a PCE or
   an operator.  A path descriptor MUST contain the RRO object if a
   primary or secondary LSP is set up along the path in the network.  A
   path descriptor MAY contain the LSPA, BANDWIDTH, and METRIC objects.
   The ERO,LSPA, BANDWIDTH, METRIC, and RRO objects are defined
   in[RFC5440].

4.2.  MPLS-TE specific descriptors for the PCUpd Message

   A Path Computation LSP Update Request message (also referred to as
   PCUpd message) is a PCEP message sent by a PCE to a PCC to update
   attributes of an LSP.  A PCUpd message can carry more than one LSP
   Update Request.  The Message-Type field of the PCEP common header for
   the PCUpd message is set to [TBD].

Internet-Draft  Stateful PCE extensions for MPLS-TE LSPs    October 2012


   The format of the PCUpd message is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and included here for easy reference:


      <PCUpd Message> ::= <Common Header>
                          <udpate-request-list>
   Where:

      <update-request-list> ::= <update-request>[<update-request-list>]

      <update-request> ::= <LSP>
                           [<path-list>]

   Where:

      <path-list>::=<path>[<path-list>]

   For MPLS-TE LSPs, the endoding of path descriptor is defined as
   follows:

      <path>::=<ERO><attribute-list>

   Where:
      <path>::=<ERO><attribute-list>

   Where:

      <attribute-list> ::= [<LSPA>]
                           [<BANDWIDTH>]
                           [<metric-list>]

      <metric-list> ::= <METRIC>[<metric-list>]

   There is one mandatory object that MUST be included within each LSP
   Update Request in the PCUpd message: the LSP object (see
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]).  If the LSP object is missing, the
   receiving PCE MUST send a PCErr message with Error-type=6 (Mandatory
   Object missing) and Error-value=[TBD] (LSP object missing).

   The LSP Update Request MUST contain a path descriptor for the primary
   path, and MAY contain one or more path descriptors for backup paths.
   A path descriptor MUST contain an ERO object.  A path descriptor MAY
   further contain the BANDWIDTH, IRO, and METRIC objects.  The ERO,
   LSPA, BANDWIDTH, METRIC, and IRO objects are defined in [RFC5440].

   Each LSP Update Request results in a separate LSP setup operation at
   a PCC.  An LSP Update Request MUST contain all LSP parameters that a
   PCC wishes to set for the LSP.  A PCC MAY set missing parameters from

   locally configured defaults.  If the LSP specified the Update Request
   is already up, it will be re-signaled.  The PCC will use make-before-
   break whenever possible in the re-signaling operation.

   A PCC MUST respond with an LSP State Report to each LSP Update
   Request to indicate the resulting state of the LSP in the network.  A
   PCC MAY respond with multiple LSP State Reports to report LSP setup
   progress of a single LSP.

   If the rate of PCUpd messages sent to a PCC for the same target LSP
   exceeds the rate at which the PCC can signal LSPs into the network,
   the PCC MAY perform state compression and only re-signal the last
   modification in its queue.

   Note that a PCC MUST process all LSP Update Requests - for example,
   an LSP Update Request is sent when a PCE returns delegation or puts
   an LSP into non-operational state.  The protocol relies on TCP for
   message-level flow control.

   Note also that it's up to the PCE to handle inter-LSP dependencies;
   for example, if ordering of LSP set-ups is required, the PCE has to
   wait for an LSP State Report for a previous LSP before triggering the
   LSP setup of a next LSP.

4.3.  MPLS-TE specific encoding for the PCReq Message for stateful PCE

   A PCC MAY include the LSP object defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] in the PCReq message if the stateful PCE
   capability has been negotiated on a PCEP session between the PCC and
   a PCE.  The definition of the PCReq message (see [RFC5440], Section
   6.4) is then extended as follows:

   Where:

4.4.  MPLS-TE specific encoding for the PCRep Message for stateful PCE

   A PCE MAY include the LSP object defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] in the PCRep message if the stateful PCE
   capability has been negotiated on a PCEP session between the PCC and
   the PCE and the LSP object was included in the corresponding PCReq
   message from the PCC.  The definition of the PCRep message (see
   [RFC5440], Section 6.5) is then extended as follows

5.  Object and TLV Formats

   The PCEP objects defined in this document are compliant with the PCEP
   object format defined in [RFC5440].  The P flag and the I flag of the
   PCEP objects defined in this document MUST always be set to 0 on
   transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt since these flags are
   exclusively related to path computation requests.

5.1.  LSP Identifiers TLVs

   Whenever the value of an LSP identifier changes, a PCC MUST send out
   an LSP State Report, where the LSP Object carries the LSP Identifiers
   TLV that contains the new value.  The LSP Identifiers TLV MUST also
   be included in the LSP object during state synchronization.  There
   are two LSP Identifiers TLVs, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6.

   The format of the IPV4-LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV is shown in the following
   figure:

                 Figure 1: IPV4-LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV format

   The type of the TLV is [TBD] and it has a fixed length of 12 octets.
   The value contains the following fields:

   IPv4 Tunnel Sender Address:  contains the sender node's IPv4 address,
      as defined in [RFC3209], Section 4.6.2.1 for the LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4
      Sender Template Object.

   LSP ID:  contains the 16-bit 'LSP ID' identifier defined in
      [RFC3209], Section 4.6.2.1 for the LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 Sender Template
      Object.

   Tunnel ID:  contains the 16-bit 'Tunnel ID' identifier defined in
      [RFC3209], Section 4.6.1.1 for the LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 Session Object.
      Tunnel ID remains constant over the life time of a tunnel.
      However, when Global Path Protection or Global Default Restoration
      is used, both the primary and secondary LSPs have their own Tunnel
      IDs.  A PCC will report a change in Tunnel ID when traffic
      switches over from primary LSP to secondary LSP (or vice versa).

   Extended Tunnel ID:  contains the 32-bit 'Extended Tunnel ID'
      identifier defined in [RFC3209], Section 4.6.1.1 for the
      LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 Session Object.

   The format of the IPV6-LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV is shown in l following

                 Figure 2: IPV6-LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV format

   The type of the TLV is [TBD] and it has a fixed length of 36 octets.
   The value contains the following fields:

   IPv6 Tunnel Sender Address:  contains the sender node's IPv6 address,
      as defined in [RFC3209], Section 4.6.2.2 for the LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6
      Sender Template Object.

   LSP ID:  contains the 16-bit 'LSP ID' identifier defined in
      [RFC3209], Section 4.6.2.2 for the LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 Sender Template
      Object.

   Tunnel ID:  contains the 16-bit 'Tunnel ID' identifier defined in
      [RFC3209], Section 4.6.1.2 for the LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 Session Object.
      Tunnel ID remains constant over the life time of a tunnel.
      However, when Global Path Protection or Global Default Restoration
      is used, both the primary and secondary LSPs have their own Tunnel
      IDs.  A PCC will report a change in Tunnel ID when traffic
      switches over from primary LSP to secondary LSP (or vice versa).

   Extended Tunnel ID:  contains the 128-bit 'Extended Tunnel ID'
      identifier defined in [RFC3209], Section 4.6.1.2 for the
      LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 Session Object.

5.2.  Tunnel ID TLV

   The Tunnel ID TLV MAY be included in the LSPA object.

   The format of the TUNNEL TLV is shown in the following figure:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                      Figure 3: Tunnel-ID TLV format

   The type of the TLV is [TBD] and it has a fixed length of 4 octets.
   The value contains a single field:

   Tunnel ID:  contains the 16-bit 'Tunnel ID' identifier defined in
      [RFC3209], Section 4.6.1.1 for the LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 Session Object.
      Tunnel ID remains constant over the life time of a tunnel.
      However, when Global Path Protection or Global Default Restoration
      is used, both the primary and secondary LSPs have their own Tunnel
      IDs.

5.3.  LSP Update Error Code TLV

   If an LSP Update Request failed, an LSP State Report MUST be sent to
   all connected stateful PCEs.  LSP State Report MUST contain the LSP
   Update Error Code TLV, indicating the cause of the failure.

   The format of the LSP-UPDATE-ERROR-CODE TLV is shown in the following
   figure:

      0                   1                   2                   3
