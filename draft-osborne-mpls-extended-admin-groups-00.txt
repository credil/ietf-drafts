1.  Introduction

   MPLS-TE advertises 32 administrative groups (commonly referred to as
   "colors" or "link colors") using the Administrative Group sub-TLV of
   the Link TLV.  This is defined for OSPF [RFC3630]and ISIS [RFC5305].

   This document adds a sub-TLV to the IGP TE extensions, "Extended
   Administrative Group".  It


2.  Extended Administrative Groups sub-TLV

   The Extended Administrative Groups sub-TLV is used in addition to the
   Administrative Groups when a device wishes to advertise more than 32
   colors for a link.  The EAG sub-TLV is optional.

   This document uses the term 'colors' as a shorthand to refer to
   particular bits with an AG or EAG.  The examples in this document use
   'red' to represent the least significant bit in the AG (red == 0x1),
   'blue' to represent the second bit (blue == 0x2).  To say that a link
   has a given color or that the specified color is set on the link is
   to say that the corresponding bit or bits in the link's AG are set to
   1.

2.1.  Packet Format

   The format of the Extended Administrative Groups sub-TLV is:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | Type: Extended Admin Group    |  Length: Variable             |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | Value: Extended Admin Group Value                             |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                        ...........                            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | Value: Extend Admin Group Value                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



   The Length is the size of the Extended Admin Group (EAG) value in
   octets.  The EAG may be of any length, but must be a multiple of 4
   octets.

2.2.  Admin group numbering

   By convention, the existing Administrative Group TLVs are numbered 0
   (LSB) to 31 (MSB).  The EAG values pick up where this numbering
   scheme leaves off.  The LSB in the EAG is 32.  If the EAG is 4 bytes
   in length, the MSB is 63.  If the EAG is 8 bytes in length, the MSB
   is 95.

2.3.  Backward compatability

   There are two things to consider for backward compatibility with
   existing AG implementations - how do AG and EAG coexist, and what
   happens if a node has matching criteria for unadvertised EAG bits?

2.3.1.  AG and EAG coexistence

   If a node advertises the EAG sub-TLV it MUST also advertise the
   existing Administrative Group (AG) sub-TLV defined in RFCs 3630 and
   5305.  This ensures that the first bit of the EAG sub-TLV is always
   bit 32, and ensures maximum interoperability with legacy
   implementations.

2.3.2.  Desire for unadvertised EAG bits

   The existing AG bits are optional; thus a node may be configured with
   a preference to include red or exclude blue, and be faced with a link
   that is not advertising a value for either blue or red.  What does an
   implementation do in this case?  It shouldn't assume that red is set,
   but it is also arguably incorrect to assume that red is NOT set, as a
   bit must first exist before it can be set to 0.

   Practically speaking this has not been an issue for deployments, as
   many implementations always advertise the AG bits, often with a
   default value of 0x00000000.  However, this issue may be of more
   concern once EAGs are added to the network.  EAGs may exist on some
   nodes but not others, and the EAG length may be longer for some links
   than for others.

   Each implementation is free to choose its own method for handling
   this question.  However, to encourage maximum interoperability an
   implementation SHOULD treat specified but unadvertised EAG bits as if
   they are set to 0.  A node MAY provide other (configurable)
   strategies for handling this case.


3.  Security Considerations

   This extension adds no new security considerations.
