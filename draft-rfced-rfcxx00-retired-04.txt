Abstract

   At one time, the RFC Editor published periodic snapshots of the
   "Internet Official Protocol Standards".  These documents were known
   as xx00 documents, the most of which was published in May 2008.  This
   document notes that the RFC Editor will no longer be publishing these
   snapshots as RFCs.

Internet-Draft         Official Protocol Standards           August 2013


1.  Introduction

   [RFC1083], published in December 1988, was the first document
   published in the RFC series that detailed a "list of documents that
   define the standards for the Internet protocol suite" and any ongoing
   experiments.  Snapshots were published on a periodic basis.
   [RFC1280] was the first of these publications to be published as STD
   1.  Starting with [RFC2200], RFC numbers ending with 00 were reserved
   for snapshots of the Official Protocol Standards.  [RFC5000],
   published in May 2008, was the last snapshot documented in an RFC.
   This document notes that the RFC Editor will no longer continue this
   tradition, and that RFC numbers typically reserved for these
   documents (i.e., those numbers ending with 00) will be available for
   assignment to other RFCs-to-be.

2.  Online List of Official Internet Protocol Standards

   Previously, publishing a snapshot of the current list of Standards
   Track and Experimental documents was helpful to the Internet
   community, as the information was not available otherwise.  However,
   in 2000, the RFC Editor produced an online list that is dynamically
   updated and available to individuals with access to the public
   Internet [STDS-TRK].  As the list has been online for over 10 years,
   it is time to make the online list more official.

3.  STD 1

   In some sense, STD 1 was retired when RFC 5000 was published.  After
   consultation with the IAB, RFC 5000 was published as an Informational
   document, but was still identified as STD 1 in the document header.
   The status was listed as Informational, as the document does not
   describe an implementable Standard.  However, it was associated with
   STD 1 to keep the document consistent with its historic connection to
   the subseries identifier.

   Because the online list has obsoleted the xx00 publications in
   practice, the IESG has decided to pursue moving RFC 5000 and STD 1 to
   Historic [RETIRE-STD1].  Marking STD 1 as Historic would result in
   identifier STD 1 not being available for future use.

4.  Cleaning Up RFC Editor Data

   As part of the cleanup related to ending the publication of the
   Official Protocol Standards, the RFC Editor will mark a number of
   unused numbers ending in 00 through RFC 7000 "never issued".  Moving
   forward, other numbers typically reserved for these documents (i.e.,
   those numbers ending with 00) will be assigned to future RFCs-to-be.
