   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) Application Token Attribute
               draft-even-mmusic-application-token-01.txt

Abstract

   The RTP fixed header includes the payload type number and the SSRC
   values of the RTP stream.  RTP defines how to de-multiplex streams
   within an RTP session, but in some use cases applications need
   further identifiers in order to identify the application semantics
   associated with particular streams within the session.

   This document defines a mechanism to provide the mapping between the
   SSRCs of RTP streams and the application semantics by defining
   extensions to RTP and RTCP messages.

1.  Introduction

   The RTP [RFC3550] header includes the payload type number and the
   SSRC values of the RTP stream.  RTP defines how to de-multiplex
   streams within an RTP session, but in some use cases, applications
   need further identifiers in order to identify semantics associated
   with particular streams within the session.

   SDP [RFC4566]can be used to describe multiple RTP media streams in
   one or more m-lines that define a single SSRC multiplexed RTP session
   (as specified in [RFC3550]).  This addresses the WebRTC architecture
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview].

Internet-Draft            SDP application token           September 2013


   A Unified Plan for Using SDP with Large Numbers of Media Flows
   [I-D.roach-mmusic-unified-plan] proposes that each m-line will
   represent a media source [I-D.lennox-raiarea-rtp-grouping-taxonomy].
   In the simple case a media source will be one video or audio RTP
   stream.  Media source description becomes more complicated when for
   robust applications, techniques like RTX and FEC are used to protect
   media.  Also simulcast/layered coding can be used to provide support
   to heterogeneous receivers.  In these cases a media source may send
   more than one RTP stream, for example, a video stream and a FEC
   stream.

   Some applications may require more information about the usage of the
   RTP streams.  For example, RTP streams from different cameras that
   need to be identified by the application in order to render them
   correctly, or a source that can send multiple versions of the same
   stream in different resolutions (Simulcast
   [I-D.westerlund-avtcore-rtp-simulcast]).

   SDP provides in [RFC4574] a "label" attribute that contains a token
   defined by an application and is used in its context.  "Label" can be
   attached to m-lines in multiple SDP documents allowing the
   application to logically identify the media streams across SDP
   sessions when necessary.  The "label" attribute is a token and does
   not provide any information about the content of the stream.
   [RFC4796] defines the "content" attribute providing information about
   the content of the stream, currently there is a small set of values
   for the content attribute.

   Both "label" and "content" attribute are SDP media-level attributes,
   so when an SDP m-line supports multiple RTP streams, this value is
   applicable to all RTP streamsdescribed by the SDP m-line.

   There is a need to have a token that will allow the mapping between a
   single RTP streams(identified by an SSRC) in an m-line to the
   application logic.  For example, SSRC1 is the RTP stream from the
   left camera and SSRC2 is the RTP stream from the right camera
   specifiedand SSRC3 is the FEC stream that protect both streams.  Note
   that there are cases where the SSRCs of the RTP streams are not known
   or may change during the call..

   Support of FEC, SVC and simulcast bring more requirements as
   explained using the following examples.

   The first example is of a unified plan
   [I-D.roach-mmusic-unified-plan] offer of one audio source and one
   video source.  The video source includes two SVC RTP streams a base
   layer and an enhancement layer.  There are also two FEC options:

   >Base layer S1 is protected by FEC repair stream R1

   Base Layer S1 and Enhancement S2 layers protected by FEC repair
   stream R2.

   This enables the answer to select the base layer with R1 or the Base
   + enhancement layers both protected by R2.

      a=ssrc-group:DDP 1000 1010

   In this case all video streams are from the same source and can be
   described using a single m-line.  The grouping relations are
   specified using the SSRCs values that need to be available in the
   offer.  It is also not clear based on the offer which SSRC is mapped
   to each of the PT numbers.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119[RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant RTP implementations.

3.  Proposal for Application ID

   As we saw in the previous section, there are tokens defined that
   could be used for the mapping, but they have existing usages and
   semantics, and tend to apply at media-level or session level rather
   than stream-level.  In order to avoid overload of existing
   attributes, it is better to have a new token attribute that can
   identify a specific RTP stream corresponding to the application.
   This document defines such new token, "AppID".

   [I-D.roach-mmusic-unified-plan] describes a use case where for early
   media it is important that the offer will include a token allowing
   the media receiver to associate it with the correct m-line.  This
   requires that the appID will be the token of the received RTP stream
   to be used by the sending side.  On the other hand to specify the

Internet-Draft            SDP application token           September 2013


   appIds of the source RTP stream and the protecting RTP streams there
   may be a need to specify the sent appId since the relations between
   the source and repair streams are for the send side and the
   protection may not be symmetrical.  Similar issue may exist for the
   simulcast use case.  This requires having a second optional attribute
   for the recv-appId to be used for early media.

3.1.  appID token

   AppID is a general-purpose token associated with an RTP stream,
   allowing the semantics of the stream with a token to be defined by
   the application.  This token may also be mapped, for example, to a
   FEC stream , or to a specific resolution in a simulcast application
   described in the SDP .

   The token is chosen by the sender, and represents the RTP stream that
   will be sent to the receiver.

   The proposed token can be sent using SDP, RTCP SDES messages
   [RFC3550], or an RTP header extension [RFC5285]

   The SSRC mapping may be available to the receiver when receiving the
   RTP stream through the RTP header extension, but may also be
   available ahead of time via an RTCP SDES message conveyed before the
   source started sending, even if the receiver has not seen any RTP
   packets from this source like in a multipoint conference or in the
   SDP description.

   The receiver can receive new sources that may be of two kinds.

   o  A new RTP stream replacing an existing RTP stream, in which case
      the AppID of the replaced RTP stream will be assigned to the new
      SSRC.

   o  A new RTP stream requiring a different AppID, for example, when
      adding a presentation stream to an existing call with two video
      cameras from a room.

   The solution supports an RTP session as described using SDP.  The RTP
   session may use Bundle [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation]with
   more than one m-lines.  In this case, if the SSRCs of all RTP streams
   are not known in advance, the AppIDs associated with each m-line need
   to be available to the media receiver in order to map each SSRC to a
   specific m-line configuration.

   The document defines a new SDP media level attribute a=appID that can
   be used to list all the appIDs that an application may use.

Internet-Draft            SDP application token           September 2013


   The appID syntax provides a token identifier and optional SDP
   attributes that describe the application usage if exists in SDP.
   Application usage in SDP may be, for example, an image attribute
   describing a simulcast application usage
   [I-D.westerlund-avtcore-rtp-simulcast] or a FEC stream that protects
   multiple RTP streams.

   Each value of the AppID maps to one SSRC at a time.  When a new SSRC
   is mapped to an existing AppID using an RTP header extension or SDES
   message, it replaces the previous RTP stream for this application
   usage.

   The formal representation of the appID token is:

      appid-attribute = "appID:" token [SP attribute]

      ; The base definition of "attribute" is in [RFC4566].

      ; (It is the content of "a=" lines.)

   Examples:

   The SSRC of the stream is not known when the SDP offer is sent, an
   appID is specified and can be used for mapping to specific SSRCs in
   the application.

      m=video 49200 RTP/AVP 99

      a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000

      a=appID:2

   The second example is when the application usage of the RTP steam is
   specified using SDP to provide different image resolutions.  The
   media receiver can map the received SSRC to the specific resolution
   based on the appId.

   Note:This example is using a separate m-line for each offered
   resolution on the send direction grouped using SCR option
   [I-D.westerlund-avtcore-rtp-simulcast] It uses the same msid for all
   grouped image attribute.  Other options will be added based on the
   work done on [I-D.westerlund-avtcore-rtp-simulcast]

   The document specify a new RTCP SDES message

   0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   ....


   This AppID is the same token as defined in the new SDP attribute and
   will also be used in the RTP header extension.

   This SDES message MAY be sent in a compound RTCP packet based on the
   application need.

3.1.2.  RTP Header Extension

   The Application ID could be carried within the RTP header extension
   field, using [RFC5285] two bytes header extension.

   This is negotiated within the SDP i.e.

   a=extmap:1 urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:App-ID

Internet-Draft            SDP application token           September 2013


   Packets tagged by the sender with the AppID will then contain a
   header extension as shown below

   0                      1                   2                   3
          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

         |  ID=1            |   Len-1              |    AppID
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |  AppID   ..............       |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   To add or modify the AppID by an intermediary can be an expensive
   operation, particularly if SRTP is used to authenticate the packet.
   Modification to the contents of the RTP header requires a re-
   authentication of the complete packet, and this could prove to be a
   limiting factor in the throughput of a multipoint device.

   There is no need to send the AppID header extension with all RTP
   packets.  Senders MAY choose to send it only when a new SSRC is sent,
   or when an SSRC changes its association to an AppID.  If such a mode
   is being used, the header extension SHOULD be sent in the first few
   RTP packets to reduce the risk of losing it due to packet loss.  For
   codecs with decoder refresh points (such as I-Frames in video
   codecs), senders also SHOULD send the AppID header extension along
   with the packets carrying the decoder refresh.

3.1.3.  recv-appID

   An offer may include a recv-appID attribute allowing the offerer to
   request from the answerer to use this token for the RTP stream sent
   from the answerer for a sendrecv or recvonly RTP stream.  This is
   important in order to support early media from the answerer that may
   be received by the offerer before the answer SDP arrives.

   The formal representation of the appID token is:

      appid-attribute = "recv-appID:" token

      ; The base definition of "attribute" is in [RFC4566].

      ; (It is the content of "a=" lines.)

4.  Using Application ID token in Offer / Answer

   The appId may be used in offer answer.  Some use cases are provided.
   They only show part of the SDP that can demonstrate the usage.

   the simple case is when each media source describes one RTP stream.
   In this case the SSRC may be used for the mapping if known but having
   appId address the case where the SSRC changes.  The recv-appID is
   offered to allow for early media synchronization.

   The offer is:

      m=video 49200 RTP/AVP 99

      a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000

      a=appID 2

      a=recv-appId 10

      a=ssrc:20010 CNAME:v1@example.com

      m=video 49200 RTP/AVP 100

      a=rtpmap:100 H264/90000

      a=appID 3

      a=recv-appId 20

      a=ssrc:20010 CNAME:v2@example.com

   In this example a three camera system sending three RTP streams
   protected by a single FEC stream. (note that the full offer may also
   include a FEC stream for each of the three RTP streams and the
   answerer may choose which FEC scheme he prefers).

   This is the SDP offer for the video sources:

   The FEC stream is specified in a separate SDP m-line even though it
   is not a media source but it does not have any msid so it is not a
   media stream track.  The appID is used to identify this stream as the
   FEC stream

   In the CLUE WG case the mapping is from a media source represented by
   an SDP m-line to a CLUE Capture encoding specified in the CLUE
   framework [I-D.ietf-clue-framework].  The mapping may be done using
   the label attribute.

   Example of an offer that offers three CLUE individual encodes.  The
   CLUE config message can be used to map an individual encode to a CLUE
   media capture [I-D.kyzivat-clue-signaling].  The label value is used
   in the CLUE protocol to identify CLUE individual encodes.  The appId
   is used to identify the stream by the receiver:
