     Subscription to Differntial Resource lists in SIP Presence 
			Event Notification model 
              draft-ilan-dispatch-subscription-diff-list-00

Abstract

   This document presents an extension to create a differential resource
   list contained in the subscription requests for SIP presence. The 
   model defined in this document expands on [RFC 5367], to specify 
   semantics for the differential resource list carried in SUBSCRIBE
   requests for subscription refreshes. This enables futher optimization
   of back-end subscriptions between RLS and inter-domain PS, and the 
   resultant notifications optimized for dynamically updated resource 
   lists.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC 4662] introduced Resource List Server(RLS), a logical node, to
   accept single subscription request for list of resources, to  
   maintain virtual subscriptions and to send notifications to
   convey the compounded state information of resource list. This model
   reduced the traffic of multiple subscriptions and notifications for
   individual resources in [RFC 3265]. However RLS left the creation 
   and maintenance of resource lists outside its scope.

   While the RLS and virtual subscription has proved successful, 
   it still suffers from the requirement to have back-end subscriptions/
   notifications for inter-domain presentities in list. Further in 
   practical applications where a large resource-list that requires 
   update, it is beneficial for RLS to employ differential list in 
   subscriptions to inter-domain Presence Server.

   [RFC 5367] specified a way to create a resource list during subscri-
   ption, by including it in the body of a single subscribe request.
   This document expands on that approach to include differntial
   resource-list in SIP SUBSCRIBE requests for changing subscriptions
   created in the initial SUBSCRIBE request dialog. 

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  Overview of Operation

3.1.  Overview

   The following figure depicts a typical SIP network. In this network,
   the UACs use RLS and virtual subscription as defined in [RFC 4662] 
   as well as the XCAP protocol to store and update the resource 
   lists.

Internet-Draft    Subscription to Diff Resource list      September 2013


   In this scenario, the RLS server has to create a list of subscription 
   targets and maintain individual subscriptions for each of the targets 
   especially for inter-domain targets. [draft-ietf-simple-interdomain-
   scaling-analysis-08] analyzed ways of optimizing the inter domain 
   subscription-notification traffic and made several optimization tech-
   niques that can be employed. 
   
   Later  [RFC 5367] specified a way to create a resource 
   list during subscription, by including it in the body of a single 
   SUBSCRIBE request. This document proposes to leverage the mechanism 
   defined in [RFC 5367] to extend RLS further such that the 
   initial subscription can be established with a partial list and 
   update the subscription using subsequent SUBSCRIBE requests. The 
   subsequent SUBSCRIBE requests shall include in the body an XML 
   document containing "differential-resource-list". The proposed method 
   defines ways to inform the type of change, actual entities to be 
   changed and a mechanism to maintain the version of the subscription 
   list using SIP Etag.  All subsequent modifications will be done 
   within the single dialog created at the start with the initial
   SUBSCRIBE message. The life-time of virtual-subscription at PS is 
   derived based on the expiry-time of initial/subsequent refresh 
   SUBSCRIBEs. 
   
   Given below is a typical message flow for the method proposed.

   The URI for the intitial SUBSCRIBE is outside the scope of the 
   document and left to the implementors. Potential ways could be to 
   provision list URIs in both PS and RLS, or for PS implements a way 
   to correlate a virtual subscription dialog, resource-list 
   and the Etag generated.   
   
   Benefits of differential subscriptions are:

     o Reduction of SIP Subscribe/Notify traffic between
       RLS and PS through list subscription instead of individual
       subscriptions

     o Subscription refresh is achieved along with differential-
       list SUBSCRIBE 

     o Subscription optimization, through grouping of resources
       per domain 
 
3.2.  Differential resource-list document format

   [RFC 5367] uses a flat "resource-list" document format provided by 
   XCAP resource list schema defined in [RFC 4826]. The same document 
   format is proposed to be used here for initial SUBSCRIBE request, 
   but subsequent SUBSCRIBE requests will use "resource-lists-diff" 
   document defined in [RFC 5362]. The IANA XML schema registry entry 
   URI is urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:resource-lists-diff.

   A sample XML document is below:

Internet-Draft    Subscription to Diff Resource list      September 2013

 
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <resource-lists-diff xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:
     resource-lists-diff">

   <add sel="*/list[@name='sip:externaldomainlist@rls.example.com'/
               entry[@uri='sip:bill@externaldomain.com']" 
        pos="before">
    <entry uri="sip:foo@externaldomain.com" />
   </add>

   </resource-lists-diff>
 
   above example adds a resource "sip:foo@externaldomain.com" into an 
   existing resource-list before "sip:bill@externaldomain.com".

4. Tracking changes to resource-list document

   RLS and PS need to have a tracking mechanism to keep the resource-
   list in sync, further event-state composition at PS depends on the
   latest resource-list to arrive at the optimal content for 
   event state information xml in NOTIFY.

   This memo proposes to use entity-tag mechanism in SIP requests
   and responses, to synchronize the resource-list document between RLS 
   and PS. Inter-domain PS MUST return "SIP-ETag" header in success
   response to back-end subscriptions and updates from RLS. Whereas
   RLS while modifying subscriptions, MUST include in a "Update-If-
   Match" header the entity-tag of such resource-list document. PS MUST
   maintain the scope and uniqueness of entity-tag for the lifetime of 
   the dialog created by back-end subscription.



5. RLS and PS processing

5.1.  RLS operations

5.1.1 Initial Subscribe Request from RLS 

   RLS that wants to establish a new subscription at PS for a group
   of resources MUST use the mechanism in [RFC 5367] prior to adopting
   the enhancements proposed in this document. Additionally RLS MUST
   must include 'diff-list-update' SIP options tag (as defined in
   section 7. IANA considerations). A sample SUBSCRIBE message is 
   given below

   SUBSCRIBE  sip:ps.externaldomain.com SIP/2.0
   Via: SIP/2.0/TCP rls.example.com;branch=z9hG4bKwYb6QREiCL
   Max-Forwards: 70
   To: PS <sip:ps.externaldomain.com>

   </resource-lists>
   
5.1.2 Updating Subscriptions 

   After successful establishment of a new subscription as per 
   section 5.1.1 RLS MAY modify the subscriptions by a subsequent 
   SUBSCRIBE request with "resource-lists-diff+xml" in the body. 
   Also RLS MUST include "Require:" header with "diff-list-update"
   option-tag as introduced by this document. 

   Further when modifying the resource-lists through a subsequent 
   SUBSCRIBE request in the same dialog, RLS MUST include in the body
   "resource-lists-diff+xml", formatted as per the schema defined in
   urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:resource-lists-diff.

   While this document defines a model for subscriptions with
   differential resource lists by RLS to inter-domain PS, the actual
   creation of the list and any other optimization of grouping
   common entries in different resource-lists such as 
   based on unique domain names are left as implementation specific.
   
5.1.3 RLS processing of responses to Subscribe Request
 
   On receiving 2xx response to initial subscribe/update requests RLS
   would store the entity-tag locally. When RLS needs to modify the 
   resource-list,sends an SUBSCRIBE request with locally stored entity-
   tag in the "Update-If-Match" header along with the XML body of 
   changes to the resource-list.  

   When a 420 response is received for initial subscribe request
   RLS MAY choose to fallback to full-list subscription model of 
   [RFC 5367], or subscription to individual resources [RFC 6665],based 
   on "Unsupported" header in the response. 


5.1.4 RLS processing of responses to SUBSCRIBE Requests

   2xx response processing follows section 5.1.3.

   When RLS receives 412 ((Conditional Request Failed) response, it
   MUST terminate the subscription and MAY recreate a new subscription
   based on its policy settings.

5.2.  PS processing 

   Presence Servers that are capable of receiving SUBSCRIBE request   
   with differential-resource-list in the body SHOULD indicate the same 
   with "diff-list-update" option-tag in "Supported:" header 
   in response to OPTIONS requests. 
   
   PS servers supporting subscriptions containing differential 
   list, will indicate acceptance of MIME type application/resource-
   lists-diff+xml by Accept: header in their responses. PS servers
   not supporting such a MIME type, will return an error response, 
   without terminating the dialog created by the initial subscribe 
   with full resource-list. RLS receiving such error response will 
   fall-back to subscription through full resource-list.


5.2.1 PS processing initial Subscribe Request

   On receiving the initial SUBSCRIBE request with a resource-list
   PS MUST create unique entity-tag [RFC 3903] identifying the virtual-
   subscription and return entity-tag in "SIP-ETag" header in success 
   response. Further processing of SUBSCRIBE request SHALL follow 
   [RFC 4662].
   
   PS that chooses to accept differential resource list, MUST include
   "Accept:" header supporting MIME type "application/resource-lists-
   diff+xml".
   
   PS that does not support differential resource-list, respond as per
   normal SIP processing rules to send 4xx response. 
   

5.2.2 PS processing of subsequent SUBSCRIBE Requests

   PS servers capable of handling "resource-lists-diff+xml" document
   MUST examine the "Update-If-Match" header in SUBSCRIBE request as 
   pre-condition for processing:

   *  If no "Update-If-Match" header is found it is rejected with
      400 (Invalid Request) response 

   *  Else entity-tag is extracted from "Update-If-Match" header, and it
      is matched against locally stored entity-tags. If no match is
      found, a 412 (Conditional Request Failed) response is returned.
      If a match is found, PS applies the differential resource-list
      into the virtual susbscription, and returns 200 OK response
      with a new entity-tag in "SIP-ETag" header

   *  If the PS does not support to this specification, it MUST send a
      420 (Bad Extension) but MUST maintain the subscription already 
      created to maintain backward compatibility of [RFC 5367]
   
5.3 Failure processing at RLS and PS

    It is likely that either of RLS or PS nodes fail and restart with  
    out any knowledge of the subscriptions they were handling. This 
    document recommends the following approaches to handle these 
    situations
	
   *  If the number of peers to subscribe to are limited, a connection
      oriented transport protocol such as TCP SHALL be used which can
      help detect the transport failure and clean up the subscriptions.
      Besides, it helps in sending large number of entities in one  
      message using TCP fragmentation
	
   *  The nodes MAY use non-volatile storage of subscription 
      information to be able to reconstruct them on restart
	
   *  In case of PS failure without any of the above methods, PS MUST 
      deny any incoming SUBSCRIBE for an old dialog possibly with an  
      update for the list with a (481 Transaction Does Not Exist) 
      error. Upon receiving this the RLS MUST terminate the 
      subscription and initiate a new one for the list
	   
   *  In case of RLS failure without any of the above methods, RLS will
      initiate a new subscription for the same list. PS MUST be able to 
      identify this and destroy the existing subscription for the list   
      and proceed with accepting the new subscription. For this, PS 
      SHALL use the list named defined in the document. PS SHALL   
      consider the subscriber identity as in From header and the list   
      name defined in the document. To make this feasible RLS MUST   
      create unique names for each list that it is subscribing to the  
      same PS. The mechanism to generate unique list names is left to    
      the implementor.   
	 
6.  Security Considerations

   "Framework and Security Considerations for SIP URI-List services"
   [RFC 5363] applies to the resource-list service discussed in this 
   document. Implementors of RLS must adhere to the guidelines presented
   in [RFC 5363].

7.  IANA Considerations

    This document defines a new SIP option tag "diff-list-update".

7.1.  diff-list-update Option-Tag

   Following is the proposed addition to the SIP Parameter Registry:
