Internet-Draft               New RA Options                February 2013


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
   protocols can be used to configure fixed and mobile nodes with
   various parameters related to addressing and routing [RFC4861],
   [RFC4862], and [RFC4191].  DNS Recursive Server Addresses and Domain
   Name Search Lists are additional parameters that can be configured
   using router advertisements [RFC6106].

   In multicast IPv4 to IPv6 transition technologies, specific IPv6
   addresses are used in which IPv4 addresses are embedded [RFC6180].
   Some of these addresses are multicast IPv6 addresses and some are
   unicast.  Both multicast and unicast addresses can be generated from
   the corresponding multicast and unicast prefixes.  These prefixes
   must be provisioned on the hosts that are involved in translation.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Multicast Translation Prefixes Configuration

   A host wishing to join a source-specific multicast (SSM) group sends
   an IGMP Membership Report message and includes the group address in
   Multicast Address field of Group Record field in IPv4 [RFC3376].
   Multicast group address MUST be a multicast group address in SSM
   range.  In IPv4 to IPv6 transition scenarios, IGMP membership Report
   message must be translated into MLD Membership Report message
   [RFC3810], usually at the IGMP/MLD proxy entity [RFC4605].  SSM group
   is identified with a group and source address in (S,G) form.  The
   source address is specified in Source Address field of Group Record
   field in IGMP Membership Report message.  There could be more than
   one source addresses associated with one Multicast Address.

   IGMP to MLD translation entity must be configured with an IPv6
   multicast group prefix that is in SSM range.
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format] defines multicast
   prefixes (MPREFIX64) for IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address based
   on an IPv4 multicast address of two types: ASM_MPREFIX64 for any-
   source multicast (ASM) and SSM_MPREFIX64 for source-specific
   multicast (SSM).

   IGMP to MLD translation entity can be configured with SSM_MPREFIX64
   by its default router if the default router includes in its Router

   Advertisements a Multicast SSM Translation Prefix option defined in
   Figure 1.  SSM_MPREFIX64 is of type ff3x:0:8000/33.  Prefix length
   MAY be set to 96.

   IGMP to MLD translation entity can be configured with ASM_MPREFIX64
   by its default router if the default router includes in its Router
   Advertisements a Multicast ASM Translation Prefix option defined in
   Figure 2.  ASM_MPREFIX64 is of type ffxx:8000/17.  Prefix length MAY
   be set to 96.

   SSM groups have one or more sources, S in (S,G).  The source address
   is specified by the joining host in IGMP Membership Report message's
   Source Address field of Group Record.  IPv4 source address in IGMP
   Membership Report message needs to be translated into an IPv6 source
   address in the translated MLD message.

   IGMP to MLD translation entity can be configured with U_PREFIX64 by
   its default router if the default router includes in its Router
   Advertisements a Multicast Translation Unicast Prefix option defined
   in Figure 3.  U_PREFIX64 could be assigned to 64:ff9b::/96 which is
   known as the well-known prefix or to some operator specific value.
   Prefix length MAY be set to 96.  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Unicast Addresses
   MUST be formed using the rules defined in [RFC6052].

   U_PREFIX64 MUST also be used in translating IPv4 multicast data
   packets from SSM sources, S of (S,G) into IPv6 multicast data
   packets.  In this case the translation entity is connected to IPv4
   network at the border of an IPv6 network, e.g.  Border Router (BR).
   Border Router MUST also be configured with U_PREFIX64 by its default
   router if the default router includes in its Router Advertisements a
   Multicast Translation Unicast Prefix option defined in Figure 3.

   Multicast translation prefixes may be configured using DHCPv6.  In
   some networks, DHCPv6 is not used such as in 3GPP networks.  RA based
   solution presented in this document can be used when DHCPv6 is not
   configured or used.  Also it could be advantageous to use RA based
   solution for some operators.


4.  Multicast Translation Prefix Options

   In this section we define three prefix options that are related to
   the translation of IGMP messages into MLD or vice versa.

   Figure 1 defines Source Specific Multicast translation prefix option
   commonly known as SSM_PREFIX64.  It is an IPv6 prefix belonging to
   source specific multicast (ssm) range with a value similar to ff3x:0:
   8000/33.  It is used in embedding IPv4 SSM range multicast addresses.

   The values MUST conform to
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format].

   Figure 2 defines Any Source Multicast translation prefix option
   commonly known as ASM_PREFIX64.  It is an IPv6 prefix belonging to
   any source multicast (asm) range with a value similar to ffxx:
   8000/17.  It is used in embedding IPv4 ASM range multicast addresses.
   The values MUST conform to
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format]

   Figure 3 defines Multicast Translation Unicast prefix option commonly
   known as U_PREFIX64.  It is an IPv6 unicast prefix It is used in
   translating IPv4 source addresses into IPv6 source address or vice
   versa for source specific multicast sources.  [RFC6052] defines two
   types for U_PREFIX_64, well known prefix of 64:ff9b::/96 or the
   network specific prefix and the mapping rules from IPv4 to IPv6
   address and vice versa.

5.  Security Considerations

   Neighbor Discovery is subject to attacks that cause IP packets to
   flow to unexpected places.  Because of this, neighbor discovery
   messages MUST be secured, possibly using Secure Neighbor Discovery
   (SEND) protocol [RFC3971].


6.  IANA Considerations
