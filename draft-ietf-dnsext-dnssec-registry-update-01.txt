      DNS Security (DNSSEC) DNSKEY Algorithm IANA Registry Updates
              draft-ietf-dnsext-dnssec-registry-update-01

Abstract

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of
   cryptographic algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over
   DNS data.  The algorithms specified for use with DNSSEC are reflected
   in an IANA maintained registry.  This document presents a set of
   changes for some entries of the registry.

Internet-Draft            IANA Registry Update                March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC4509], [RFC5155], and [RFC5702] uses
   digital signatures over DNS data to provide source authentication and
   integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses an IANA registry to list codes for
   digital signature algorithms (consisting of a cryptographic algorithm
   and one-way hash function).

   This document updates a set of entries in the IANA registry for
   Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers.  These new
   entries are given in Section 2.2 below.  This list includes changes
   to selected entries originally set aside for future algorithm
   specification that did not occur.  These three entries are changed to
   "Reserved" to avoid potential conflicts with older implementations.
   This document also brings the list of references for entries up to
   date.

   There are auxillery registries related to the Domain Name System
   Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers registry that deal with various
   Diffie-Hellmen parameters used with DNSSEC.  These registry tables
   are not altered by this document.

2.  The DNS Security Algorithm Number Sub-registry

   The DNS Security Algorithm Number sub-registry (part of the Domain
   Name System (DNS) Security Number registry) contains a set of entries
   that contain errors.  There are additional differences to entries
   that are described in sub-section 2.1 and the complete list of
   changed registry entries is in sub-section 2.2.

2.1.  Updates and Additions

   This document updates three entries in the Domain Name System
   Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Registry.  They are:

   The description for assignment number 4 is changed to "Reserved".

   The description for assignment number 9 is changed to "Reserved".

   The description for assignment number 11 is changed to "Reserved".

   The above values are changed to "Reserved" because they were
   placeholders for algorithms that were not fully specified for use
   with DNSSEC.  Older implementations may still have these algorithm
   codes assigned, so these codes are reserved to prevent potential
   incompatibilities.

2.2.  Domain Name System (DNS) Security Algorithm Number Registry Table

   The list of Domain Name System (DNS) Security Algorithm Number
   registry entry changes are given below.  All other existing entries
   in the registry table are unchanged by this document and are not
   shown.  The other two tables in this registry (DNS KEY Record Diffie-
   Hellman Prime Lengths and DNS KEY Record Diffie-Hellman Well-Known
   Prime/Generator Pairs) are not changed in any way by this document.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates a set of Domain Name System (DNS) Security
   Algorithm Numbers registry entries as given in Section 2.2.  The
   changes include moving three registry entries to "Reserved" and
   updating the reference list for entries.

   The original Domain Name System (DNS) Security Algorithm Number
   registry is available at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document replaces the Domain Name System (DNS) Security
   Algorithm Numbers registry with an updated table.  It is not meant to
   be a discussion on algorithm superiority.  No new security
   considerations are raised in this document.
